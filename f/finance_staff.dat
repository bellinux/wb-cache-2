50|$|Daniel Fernandes {{observed}} the naïve diversification among samples of undergraduates, PhD students, professors of <b>finance,</b> <b>staff</b> {{members at the}} university and Mturk workers. He used a similar procedure to Benartzi and Thaler's experiment about savings allocations to elicit the naïve diversification bias of each individual subject. Respondents were asked to make two hypothetical decisions. In the first decision, respondents had to allocate their savings to five funds, of which four were stock funds. In the second decision, respondents had to allocate their savings to five funds, of which four were fixed-income funds. The results replicate the original finding that respondents were way more likely to invest in stocks when the proportion of stock funds was larger. In addition, several individual difference scales were measured. Only differences in focus on intuition correlate with the naïve diversification bias. The more investors use intuitive judgments, the more they display the naïve diversification bias.|$|E
5000|$|In 1973, the {{property}} became the offices, recording studios and premises of Island Records, who {{moved in with}} a staff of 65. The house became the administrative offices of the company, where the legal and <b>finance</b> <b>staff</b> worked, while the former laundry buildings were the offices for the A&R, production, marketing, promotion and sales departments. The basement was converted into a small recording studio, called the Fallout Shelter with its entrance at 47 British Grove, incorporating the base of the chimney, which was occasionally used in recordings to add reverb to vocals. The recording studio, was described by Chris Blackwell, the founder of Island Records, as 'the little one in the back of Island Records at 47 British Grove.'With the sound of recording sessions continuing late into the night, members of staff sleeping on the premises, the comings and goings of musicians, staff and visitors, the use of their parking spaces, and the noise all this made, caused friction between Island Records and some local residents. There was also a canteen above the studio. The roster of musicians recording on the Island label at this time included reggae artists Bob Marley and the Wailers who recorded some tracks for Exodus there, [...] Toots and the Maytals, Aswad and Steel Pulse. The 'non reggae' Island artists include Cat Stevens, Robert Palmer and Steve Winwood (working with the Spencer Davis Group and Traffic, and as a solo artist), Grace Jones, Tom Waits, Melissa Etheridge, Amy Winehouse and P J Harvey and their most successful signing, the Irish band U2.|$|E

5000|$|A {{number of}} {{measures}} were introduced under the First Wilson Government to make Britain {{a more open}} and humane society. The Race Relations Act 1965 outlawed direct discrimination {{on the grounds of}} race, colour, and ethnic or national origin in some public places. The legislation also set up a Race Relations Board. A centrally financed network of local officers was provided to smooth inter-racial relations by conciliation, education, and informal pressure, while a National Committee for Commonwealth Immigrants was established (under the chairmanship of the Archbishop of Canterbury) to encourage and help <b>finance</b> <b>staff</b> [...] "for local voluntary, good-neighbour type bodies." [...] A further Race Relations Act 1968 was passed, which made discrimination in letting or advertising housing illegal, together with discrimination in hiring and promotion. The legislation also provided a strengthened Race Relations Board with powers to [...] "conciliate" [...] in cases of discrimination, which meant persuading discriminators to stop such acts and, if they refused to stop, legal action could be taken against them as an ultimate sanction. The legislation also replaced the National Committee for Commonwealth Immigrants with the Community Relations Commission, a statutory body. This body was provided with an annual grant (beginning at £300,000) for social work, propaganda, and education as a means of bringing about good race relations. The Criminal Justice Act 1967 introduced suspended prison sentences and allowed a ten to two majority vote for jury decisions. An Ombudsman (Parliamentary Commissioner) was appointed in 1967 to consider complaints against government departments and to impose remedies, while censorship of plays by the Lord Chamberlain was abolished (1969). In addition, the law on Sunday Observance was relaxed, and a strengthening of legal aid was carried out.|$|E
