The reliability of assemblies which have been cleaned with vapor degreasing and spray cleaning can be seriously compromised by residual contaminants leading to solder joint failure, board corrosion, and even electrical failure of the mounted parts. In addition, recent government actions to eliminate <b>fully</b> <b>halogenated</b> <b>chlorofluorocarbons</b> (CFC) and chlorinated hydrocarbons from the industrial environment require the development of new cleaning materials and techniques. This paper will discuss alternative cleaning materials and techniques and results that can be expected with them. Particular emphasis will be placed on problems related to surface-mounted parts. These new techniques may lead to improved circuit reliability and, at the same time, be less expensive and less environmentally hazardous than the traditional systems...|$|E
40|$|Concern {{over the}} global {{environmental}} consequences of <b>fully</b> <b>halogenated</b> <b>chlorofluorocarbons</b> (CFCs) {{has created a}} need to determine the potential impacts of other halogenated organic compounds on stratospheric ozone and climate. The CFCs, which do not contain an H atom, are not oxidized or photolyzed in the troposphere. These compounds are transported into the stratosphere where they decompose {{and can lead to}} chlorine catalyzed ozone depletion. The hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs or HFCs), in particular those proposed as substitutes for CFCs, contain at least one hydrogen atom in the molecule, which confers on these compounds a much greater sensitivity toward oxidation by hydroxyl radicals in the troposphere, resulting in much shorter atmospheric lifetimes than CFCs, and consequently lower potential for depleting ozone. The available information is reviewed which relates to the lifetime of these compounds (HCFCs and HFCs) in the troposphere, and up-to-date assessments are reported of the potential relative effects of CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs, and halons on stratospheric ozone and global climate (through 'greenhouse' global warming) ...|$|E
40|$|Depletion of the {{stratospheric ozone}} layer now ranks near the top among global environ-mental problems. As {{a result of the}} {{attention}} focused on this issue, an unprecedented in-ternational agreement has been reached which mandates curtailment of the production and use of <b>fully</b> <b>halogenated</b> <b>chlorofluorocarbons</b> (CFCs). That Agreement, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, was signed in September 1987 and was subsequently ratified by the majority of signatory nations. The phased reductions in CFC production and consumption required by the Protocol are now well known to most individuals in the industries which use CFCs. Beginning July 1, 1989 CFC production and consumption were frozen at 1986 levels; by mid- 1993 and by mid- 1998 CFC production and consumption must be reduced by 20 percent and another 30 percent, respectively, for a final reduction of 50 percent from 1986 levels. The Montreal Protocol accelerated what was already a major industry effort to find suitable alternatives for CFCs. Both CFC producers and end-user industries had been researching substitutes or alternative production and processing technologies to reduce CFC use. Although much research into substitutes remains to be done, tremendous strides have al-ready been made toward reducing CFC use in polyurethanes and polyisocyanurates. Thi...|$|E

Many CFCs {{have been widely used}} as refrigerants, propellants (in aerosol applications), and solvents. Because CFCs contribute to ozone depletion in the upper atmosphere, the manufacture of such compounds has been phased out under the Montreal Protocol, and they are being replaced with other products such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) (e.g., R-410A) and R-134a.|$|R

40|$|Ligand {{exchange}} of hydrated metal complexes {{is common in}} chemical and biological systems. Using the ultrafast T-jump, we examined this process, specifically the transformation of aqua cobalt (II) complexes to their <b>fully</b> <b>halogenated</b> species. The results reveal a stepwise mechanism with time scales varying from hundreds of picoseconds to nanoseconds. The dynamics are significantly faster when the structure is retained but becomes rate-limited when the octahedral-to-tetrahedral structural change bottlenecks the transformation. Evidence is presented, from bimolecular kinetics and energetics (enthalpic and entropic), for a reaction in which the ligand assists the displacement of water molecules, with the retention of the entering ligand in the activated state. The reaction time scale deviates by one to two orders of magnitude from that of ionic diffusion, suggesting the involvement of a collisional barrier between the ion and the much larger complex...|$|R
30|$|The {{amount of}} {{chemicals}} with high ODP produced worldwide has decreased following the Montreal protocol and further international treaties. Because {{of the high}} volatility of the substances in question, the real decontamination of the technosphere can only be demonstrated by measurements in the troposphere followed by model calculations {{for the development of}} the ozone concentration. As a result of the implementation of the conventions mentioned before, the concentration of chlorine and of <b>fully</b> <b>halogenated</b> CFCs is decreasing, whereas the amount of partially halogenated chemicals like HCFCs is increasing again. The influence of improper waste management on the overall development cannot be assessed quantitatively. But closing the sources of illegal emission of Freon compounds would help to revitalize the earth’s ozone belt years earlier. The decontamination of the stratosphere will need a lot of time. Actually, the ozone layer is expected to return to its pre- 1980 levels around the middle of the 21 st century [49].|$|R
40|$|The {{atmospheric}} lifetimes {{of molecules}} containing chlorine and bromine are the dominant parameters influencing {{their ability to}} promote enhanced ozone destruction in the stratosphere. The purpose of this report is to assess {{the present state of}} knowledge of the lifetimes of halocarbons using two complementary approaches. First, a time series of measurements of gas concentrations is used together with information on their emissions histories and a computational model of atmospheric circulation and chemistry to infer lifetimes through a mass balance approach. Second, an atmospheric chemical-dynamical model is used with detailed information on the chemistry and spectroscopy of the molecules of interest to calculate lifetimes. The lifetimes determined by these two methods are then compared. Attention is focused most closely on <b>fully</b> <b>halogenated</b> chlorine- and bromine-containing molecules, primarily the chlorofluorocarbons, and the halons, because of their ability to deliver chlorine and bromine to the stratosphere. Some attention will be given to those molecules containing hydrogen, which are subject to removal in the troposphere primarily by reaction with OH and by other processes...|$|R
40|$|Four {{atmospheric}} modeling {{groups have}} calculated relative effects of several halocarbons (chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) - 11, 12, 113, 114, and 115; hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC's) 22, 123, 124, 141 b, and 142 b; hydrofluorocarbons (HFC's) 125, 134 a, 143 a, and 152 a, carbon tetrachloride; and methyl chloroform) on stratospheric ozone. Effects on stratospheric ozone {{were calculated for}} each compound and normalized relative {{to the effect of}} CFC- 11. These models include the representations for homogeneous physical and chemical processes in the middle atmosphere but do no account for either heterogeneous chemistry or polar dynamics which are important in the spring time loss of ozone over Antarctica. Relative calculated effects using a range of models compare reasonably well. Within the limits of the uncertainties of these model results, compounds now under consideration as functional replacements for <b>fully</b> <b>halogenated</b> compounds have modeled stratospheric ozone reductions of 10 percent or less of that of CFC- 11. Sensitivity analyses examined the sensitivity of relative calculated effects to levels of other trace gases, assumed transport in the models, and latitudinal and seasonal local dependencies. Relative effects on polar ozone are discussed in the context of evolving information on the special processes affecting ozone, especially during polar winter-springtime. Lastly, the time dependency of relative effects were calculated...|$|R
40|$|The <b>fully</b> <b>halogenated</b> or {{hydrogenated}} B 12 X 12 (X = H, F, Cl, Br and I) clusters are {{confirmed to}} be icosahedral. On the other hand, the bare B 12 cluster {{is shown to}} have a planar structure. A previous study showed that a transformation from an icosahedron to a plane happens when 5 to 7 iodine atoms are substituted. Later, the transition was confirmed to be seven iodine substitutions based on an infrared spectroscopy study. In this study, we investigated the effects of different halogen atoms on {{the opening of the}} B 12 icosahedral cage by means of density functional theory calculations. We found that the halogen elements do not have significant effects on the geometries of the clusters. The computed IR spectra show similar representative peaks for all halogen substituted clusters. Interestingly, we found a blue-shift in the IR spectra with the increase in the mass of the halogen atoms. Further, we compared the Gibbs free energies at different temperatures for different halogen atoms. The results show that the Gibbs free energy differences between open and close structures of B 12 X 7 become larger when heavier halogen atoms are present. This interesting finding was subsequently investigated by energy decomposition analysis...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{performances}} of a vapour compression refrigeration plant using as working fluids R 22 and its substitute R 417 A (R 125 /R 134 a/R 600, 46. 6 / 50 / 3. 4 % in mass) are experimentally studied. This type of plant is applied to a commercially available cold store, generally adopted for preservation of foodstuff. Its working is regulated by on/off cycles of the compressor, operating at the nominal frequency of 50 Hz, imposed by the classical thermostatic control. The problems related to {{the replacement of the}} <b>fully</b> <b>halogenated</b> chlorofluorcarbons (CFCs) and of the partially halogenated (HCFCs) have been only partially solved. As for R 22, there is no unanimous solution for its substitution. In this paper, the refrigerant fluid experimentally tested as a substitute for R 22 is the non-azeotropic mixture R 417 A. R 417 A is a non-ozone depleting long term replacement for R 22, which can be used in new and existing direct expansion systems using traditional R 22 lubricants. R 417 A provides an easy solution to the legislation requirement, since it presents an ozone depletion potential equal to zero, and it does not require a change of lubricant type, equipment redesign or significant modifications. The experimental analysis has allowed the determination of the best energetic performances of R 22 in comparison with those of R 417 A in terms of the coefficient of performance, exergetic efficiency, exergy destroyed in the plant components and other variables characterizing the refrigeration plant performance...|$|R
40|$|The photolytic {{reduction}} of ferrihydrite (am-Fe_ 2 O_ 3 * 3 H_ 2 O), lepidocrocite (γ-FeOOH), goethite (a-FeOOH), hematite (α-Fe_ 2 O_ 3), maghemite (γ-Fe_ 2 O_ 3) and iron-containing aerosol particles (Fe_(aerosol)) {{in the presence}} of a series of halogenated acetic acids has been investigated. The fastest rates of photo{{reduction of}} Fe(lll) to Fe(ll) were achieved with ferrihydrite as an electron acceptor and fluoroacetic acid as an electron donor. The relative rates of photooxidation of the monohalogenated acetic acids with ferrihydrite in order of decreasing reactivity were as follows: FCH_ 2 CO_ 2 H > CICH_ 2 CO_ 2 H > BrCH_ 2 CO_ 2 H > ICH_ 2 CO_ 2 H; for multiple substituents the relative order of reactivity was as follows: FCH_ 2 CO_ 2 H > F_ 2 CHCO_ 2 H > F_ 3 CCO_ 2 H. With respect to the iron oxide electron acceptors, the relative order of reactivity toward monohaloacetate oxidation was am-Fe_ 2 O_ 3 - 3 H_ 2 O > γ-Fe_ 2 O_ 3 > γ-FeOOH ≥ α-Fe_ 2 O_ 3 ≥ Fe_(aerosol) > α-FeOOH. Strong kinetic isotope effects observed for the photooxidation of CICD_ 2 CO_ 2 H suggest that the oxidation of the mono- and disubstituted haloacetic acids proceeds via hydrogen-atom abstraction by surface-bound hydroxyl radicals to produce haloacetate radicals, which in turn yield the corresponding halide and glycolic acid. <b>Fully</b> <b>halogenated</b> haloacetic acids appear to be oxidized via a photo-Kolbe mechanism to yield the corresponding halo acids and CO_ 2...|$|R

The site is very well located to provide important insights on changes in atmospheric composition in a region that is of great significance for emissions of both anthropogenic and biogenic halogenated compounds. Measurements are performed since March 2006, with grab samples collected on a weekly basis. The first three years of data have been analysed. After the identification of the atmospheric background values for fourteen halocarbons, the frequency of occurrence of pollution events have been compared {{with the same kind of}} analysis for data collected at other global background stations. The analysis showed the <b>fully</b> <b>halogenated</b> species, whose production and consumption are regulated under the Montreal Protocol, show a significant occurrence of "above the baseline" values, as a consequence of their current use in the developing countries surrounding the region, meanwhile the hydrogenated gases, more recently introduced into the market, show less frequent spikes. Atmospheric concentration trends have been calculated as well, and they showed a fast increase, ranging from 5. 7 to 12. 6 %, of all the hydrogenated species, and a clear decrease of methyl chloroform (- 17. 7 %). The comparison with time series from other stations has also allowed to derive Meridional gradients, which are absent for long living well mixed species, while for the more reactive species, the gradient increases inversely with respect to their atmospheric lifetime. The effect of long range transport and of local events on the atmospheric composition at the station has been analysed as well, allowing the identification of relevant source regions the Northern half of the Indian sub-continent.

40|$|Studies {{addressed}} {{to a deep}} understanding of the structure/property relationship on the near infrared (NIR) -emissive erbium-quinolinolate complexes, which are of interest for low-cost photonic systems, are reviewed. The role of the 8 -quinolinolate ligand (Q), which studies also as sensitizer to overcome the weak absorptivity of lanthanide ion, is discussed. Synthetic and structural aspects are reported to revise the old assumption that these complexes are analogous in structure to AlQ 3 and {{to point out the}} specificity of the lanthanide coordination chemistry. In fact depending on reaction conditions, species with high coordination numbers and differing for nuclearity and stoichiometry have been isolated and fully characterized. In some instances {{it has been shown that}} coordinated water molecules directly bounded to the emitting erbium ion definitely represent the most effective quenchers for the luminescence at 1. 5 μm. Additionally, the combined optical and structural investigation of water-free Er-quinolinolate complexes, allows one to conclude that the C-H groups sitting in the Er 3 + inner coordination sphere represent a very severe limit to the near-infrared emission yield. Implementation of structural/spectroscopic data into a theoretical model based on Förster's energy transfer resonant theory provides a comprehensive analysis of the near infrared emission quenching in erbium complexes useful to predict the quenching effects in luminescent lanthanide-complexes from the measurements of the vibrational absorption spectrum of the compound, the lanthanide radiative lifetime, and the minimum distance between the emitting ion and the quenchers. On that basis, in order to significantly improve the near-infrared emission yield, ligands which do not bear NH, CH or OH groups at a distance shorter than 7 - 8 Å from the emitting ion are required. At the same time high sensitization efficiency of near-infrared emission and population saturation of trivalent erbium is achieved in these complexes, photoexcited into the absorption band of the quinolinolate sensitizer. It is concluded that a <b>fully</b> <b>halogenated</b> quinolinolate ligand can be an optimal candidate to improve the luminescent properties of erbium complexes. © 2011 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
40|$|The study {{identifies}} the main fields of political {{activities of the}} EU that {{have an impact on}} the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), names the regulations (Directives, Regulations and Programmes) adopted and planned in those areas and evaluates their relevance for climate policy. Furthermore, the political options and room for manoeuvre as well as the probable implementation opportunities, especially during the German Council Presidency in the first half of 1999 are discussed. In addition to the most important GHG CO_ 2, methane (CH_ 4), nitrous oxide (N_ 2 O), partially and <b>fully</b> <b>halogenated</b> fluorocarbons (HFCs and PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF_ 6) are considered in the study. Apart form measures of climate policy aiming directly at a reduction of GHGs, the analysis includes activities which have an indirect impact. The latter are to be found mainly in the policy areas of energy, agriculture and forestry, transportation, the environment and in the promotion of regional development (structural policies) within the EU. The report comes to the conclusion that the implemented climate policy measures of the EU are currently limited to the GHG CO_ 2, focusing on selected aspects of energy policy. Apart form this, several announcements and proposals exist. In case of their implementation, measures taken on the European level could prove sufficient alone to reduce GHG emissions of the EU by 8 % until 2008 - 2012 as envisaged in the Kyoto Protocol. This would strengthen the leadership role of the EU proclaimed internationally. However, it is the implementation of proposed regulations which constitutes the weak point of EU climate policy. A collection of the legislative initiatives with the greatest relevance to climate policy points to the most important areas of activities for an effective EU climate policy. (orig.) Die Studie identifiziert die wesentlichen politischen Handlungsfelder der EU mit Einfluss auf die Emissionen von Treibhausgasen (THG), benennt die bisherigen und geplanten Regelungen und Aktivitaeten (Richtlinien, Verordnungen und Programme) in diesen Bereichen und bewertet ihre klimapolitische Relevanz. Weiterhin werden die politischen Handlungsspielraeume und voraussichtlichen Umsetzungsmoeglichkeiten, insbesondere unter der deutschen Ratspraesidentschaft Anfang 1999, diskutiert. Neben dem massgeblichen THG CO_ 2 werden Methan (CH_ 4), Lachgas (N_ 2 O), teilhalogenierte Fluorkohlenwasserstoffe (H-FKW), perfluorierte Kohlenwasserstoffe (FKW) und Schwefelhexafluorid (SF_ 6) in der Untersuchung beruecksichtigt. Neben unmittelbar klimapolitischen Massnahmen, die direkt auf eine THG-Reduktion abzielen, werden auch indirekt wirksame Aktivitaeten in die Bewertung einbezogen. Letztere sind vor allem in den Bereichen Energiepolitik, Land- und Forstwirtschaft, Verkehrspolitik, Foerderung der Regionalentwicklung (Strukturpolitik) in der EU und in der Umweltpolitik zu finden. Ergebnis der Studie ist, dass sich existierende klimapolitische Massnahmen der EU bislang auf das Treibhausgas CO_ 2 beschraenken und sich hier wiederum auf Teilbereiche der Energiepolitik konzentrieren. Daneben existieren eine Reihe von Ankuendigungen und Vorschlaegen. Im Falle von deren entschiedener Umsetzung koennte das im Kioto-Protokoll fuer die EG verankerte Minderungsziel von 8 % voraussichtlich allein durch Massnahmen auf der europaeischen Ebene erreicht und so die international proklamierte Vorreiterrolle untermauert werden. Genau in der Umsetzung von Regelungsvorschlaegen liegt aber die Schwaeche der EG-Klimapolitik.
