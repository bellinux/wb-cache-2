In an interview in 2014, Heinz Prüller recalled Rindt speaking about Indianapolis in 1967: [...] "In Indianapolis, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>feel</b> like I am on my way to my own funeral." [...] At another occasion, he said about the track: [...] "It is catastrophic, I only drive there because of the money." ...|$|E
500|$|... {{that would}} be all right. She is {{supposed}} to be exorcising spots and iron stains, same as Lady MacBeth(!). The verb is imperative, and apparently it is not reasonable to use [...] "no" [...] with a vocative noun. It is a contradiction to address [...] "no spot!" [...] I am afraid this is rather muddled; I used to know my Latin grammar but it has faded ... I wish another book could be planned out before the summer, if we are going on with them, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>feel</b> very much lost when they are finished.|$|E
500|$|... "Soul Sound" [...] {{was written}} by the Scottish {{musician}} Charlotte Gordon Cumming during her trip to Kenya. Her inspiration to write the song stemmed from Africa, a continent which she visited frequently with her family as a child. According to Cumming, [...] "In Africa I feel extremely alive, but also very small. The song was the essence of how I felt: seeing the beauty and horror of a place, and going into a heightened state." [...] She elaborated, [...] "My songs are all about who I am and what I am feeling, {{which is why they}} can take so much out of me to perform – and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>feel</b> a lot when I go to Africa".|$|E

I do hope that the evangelist won't {{come and talk to}} me special to-night. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>feels</b> as if <b>I</b> was being pulled two different ways, when he does." ...|$|R

500|$|... "When I {{was writing}} it, I {{was sitting in}} a fourth-floor walk-up on Avenue-B, and there was this {{gorgeous}} Puerto Rican boy sitting across me that I wanted {{to go out on a}} date with, and I just wanted to get the song over with. I ultimately did go out with him and the song was finished just before my last date with him, which I'm kinda happy that it did not continue... The dance floor was quite a magical place for me. I started off wanting to be a dancer, so that had a lot to do with the song. The freedom that <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>feel</b> when I'm dancing, that feeling of inhabiting your body, letting yourself go, expressing yourself through music. I always thought of it as a magical place– even if you're not taking ecstasy. Hence that came to me as the primary inspiration for 'Into the Groove'." ...|$|E
500|$|Catt, Stone and Blackwell went {{together}} to the January, 1892 NAWSA convention in Washington, DC. Along with Isabella Beecher Hooker, Stone, Stanton and Anthony, the [...] "triumvirate" [...] of women's suffrage, were called {{away from the}} convention's opening hours by an unexpected woman suffrage hearing before the United States House Committee on the Judiciary. Stone told the assembled congressmen [...] "I come before this committee with the sense which <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>feel,</b> that we are handicapped as women in {{what we try to}} do for ourselves by the single fact that we have no vote. This cheapens us. You do not care so much for us as if we had votes..." [...] Stone argued that men should work to pass laws for equality in property rights between the sexes. Stone demanded an eradication of coverture, the folding of a wife's property into that of her husband. Stone's impromptu speech paled in comparison to Stanton's brilliant outpouring which preceded hers. Stone later published Stanton's speech in its entirety in the Woman's Journal as [...] "Solitude of Self". Back at the NAWSA convention, Anthony was elected president, with Stanton and Stone becoming honorary presidents.|$|E
500|$|After {{finishing}} {{the music for}} the album, the band decided that the artwork needed to reflect the themes on the record, likening the change of image to a political campaign. Armstrong recalled, [...] "We wanted to be firing on all cylinders. [...] Everything from the aesthetic to the music to the look. [...] Just everything." [...] Green Day drew inspiration from Chinese communist propaganda art the band saw in art galleries on Melrose Avenue and recruited artist Chris Bilheimer, who had designed the art for the previous records Nimrod and International Superhits! to create the cover. The band aimed for the cover to be [...] "at once uniform and powerful". The album's artwork—"a Posada-stark print of a heart-shaped hand grenade gripped in a blood-soaked fist"—is representative of its political content. After listening to the new music on his computer, Bilheimer took note of the lyric [...] "And she's holding on my heart like a hand grenade" [...] from [...] "She's a Rebel". Influenced by artist Saul Bass's poster for the 1955 drama film The Man with the Golden Arm, Bilheimer created an upstretched arm holding a red heart-shaped grenade. Although he felt that red is the [...] "most overused color in graphic design", {{he felt that the}} [...] "immediate" [...] qualities of the color deemed it appropriate for use on the cover. He explained, [...] "I'm sure there's psychological theories of it being the same color of blood and therefore has the powers of life and death... And as a designer <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>feel</b> it's kind of a cop-out, so I never used it before. But there was no way you couldn't use it on this cover." ...|$|E

2500|$|US President Theodore Roosevelt was an honored guest. Mark Twain and Henry H. Rogers {{also paid}} a visit, in the latter's yacht [...] "Kanawha". Twain's humorous talk was partly an {{introduction}} of Rear Admiral Purnell F. Harrington, former Commandant of the Norfolk Navy Yard. Said Twain, [...] "In my remarks of welcome of Admiral Harrington, I {{am not going}} to give him compliments. Compliments always embarrass a man. You do not know what to say. It does not inspire you with words. There is nothing you can say in answer to a compliment. I have been complimented myself a great many times, and they always embarrass me. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>feel</b> they have not said enough." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album's booklet is twenty-four pages long, {{consisting}} of song lyrics and comics drawn by Zombie. Gene Colan and Dan Brereton, of Marvel Comics, contributed numerous drawings for the booklet. The booklet contains numerous images of ghosts, goblins, monsters, and other creatures. Numerous references to Lucifer and Satan are made throughout the pages, along {{with images of}} Sheri Moon and other near-nude women. Zombie had {{a replica of the}} robot from the film The Phantom Creeps (1939) created for the booklet. The replica was created by Wayne Toth, and stood ten feet tall. The creation is featured {{on the back of the}} album, as well as the single cover for [...] "Dragula". Zombie would continue to use it for numerous live performances and appearances, including the music video for his single [...] "Dead City Radio and the New Gods of Supertown" [...] (2013). Zombie said of the booklet, [...] "It’s a welcome relief from the less-is-more school of thought [...] I grew up in the heyday of cool record packaging. I would stare at the record for hours. Now, you open a record and you get nothing. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>feel</b> cheated." [...] The disc itself is either white or yellow depending on the version, and features images of various monsters and ghouls also designed by Zombie.|$|E
