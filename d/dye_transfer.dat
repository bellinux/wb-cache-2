A Technicolor print from the <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> era will retain its original colors virtually unchanged for decades with proper storage, whereas prints printed on Eastmancolor stocks produced prior to 1983 may suffer color fading after exposure to ultraviolet light and hot, humid conditions {{as a result of}} less stable photochemical dyes. Fading on some prints is so rapid that in some cases, after as little as five to ten years, the colors of the print have faded to a brownish red.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, Haas {{switched}} from his medium format Rolleiflex {{to the smaller}} 35mm Leica rangefinder camera, which he used consistently {{for the rest of}} his career. Once he began working in color, he most often used Kodachrome, known for its rich, saturated colors. To print his color work, Haas used the <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> process whenever possible. An expensive, complex process most frequently used at the time for advertising, <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> allowed for great control over color hue and saturation.|$|E
50|$|In 1994, Eastman Kodak {{stopped making}} all {{materials}} for this process. The dyes {{used in the}} process are very spectrally pure compared to normal coupler-induced photographic dyes, {{with the exception of}} the Kodak cyan. The dyes have excellent light and dark fastness. The <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> process possesses a larger color gamut and tonal scale than any other process, including inkjet. Another important characteristic of <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> is that it allows the practitioner the highest degree of photographic control compared to any other photochemical color print process.|$|E
50|$|In 1963, Land {{introduced}} Polacolor pack film, {{which made}} instant color photographs possible. This process involved pulling two tabs from the camera, the second which pulled the film sandwich through the rollers to develop {{out of the}} camera. The instant color process is much more complex, involving a negative which contains three layers of emulsion sensitive to blue, green, and red. Underneath each layer are dye developing molecules in their complementary colors of yellow, magenta, and cyan. When light strikes an emulsion layer, it blocks the complementary dye below it. For instance, when blue strikes the blue sensitive emulsion layer, it blocks the yellow dye, but allows the magenta and cyan <b>dyes</b> to <b>transfer</b> to the positive, which combine to create blue. When green and red (yellow) strikes their respective layers, it blocks the complementary dyes of magenta and cyan below them, allowing only yellow <b>dye</b> to <b>transfer</b> to the positive.|$|R
50|$|In 1928, Technicolor {{started making}} their prints by the {{imbibition}} process, which was mechanical rather than photographic {{and allowed the}} color components to be combined {{on the same side}} of the film. Using two matrix films bearing hardened gelatin relief images, thicker where the image was darker, aniline color <b>dyes</b> were <b>transferred</b> into the gelatin coating on a third, blank strip of film.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe major light-harvesting {{chlorophyll}} a/b complex (LHCII) greatly {{enhances the}} efficiency of photosynthesis in green plants. Recombinant LHCII can be assembled in vitro from its denatured, bacterially expressed apoprotein and plant pigments. This makes it an interesting candidate for biomimetic light-harvesting in photovoltaic applications. Due to its almost 20 pigments bound per apoprotein, LHCII absorbs efficiently in the blue and red spectral domains of visible light but less efficiently in the green domain, the so-called “green gap” in its absorption spectrum. Here we present a hybrid complex of recombinant LHCII with organic dyes that add to LHCII absorption in the green spectral region. One or three Rhodamine Red dye molecules were site-specifically attached to cysteine side chains in the apoprotein and did not interfere with LHCII assembly, function and stability. The <b>dyes</b> <b>transferred</b> their excitation energy virtually completely to the chlorophylls in LHCII, partially filling in the green gap. Thus, organic dyes {{can be used to}} increase the absorption cross section and, thus, the light-harvesting efficiency of recombinant LHCII...|$|R
50|$|Technicolor {{introduced}} <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> in its Process 3, {{introduced in}} the feature film The Viking (1928), which was produced by the Technicolor Corporation and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Technicolor's two previous systems were an additive color process and a physically problematic subtractive color process, the latter requiring two prints cemented together back-to-back. Process 3 used an imbibition process pioneered by the Handschiegl color process, which had been created in 1916 for Cecil B. DeMille's feature film Joan the Woman (1917). Technicolor further refined the imbibition <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> process in its Process 4, introduced in 1932, which employed three simultaneously filmed negatives.|$|E

This gave it longer projection life but also improved registration. One of its primary applications was usage in Technicolor's dye imbibition printing (<b>dye</b> <b>transfer).</b> The DH perf never had broad uptake, and Kodak's introduction of monopack Eastmancolor film in the 1950s reduced the demand for <b>dye</b> <b>transfer,</b> although the DH perf persists in special application intermediate films to this day.|$|E
40|$|Alkyl polyglucosides (APGs) have {{appeared}} on the market, offering good levels of biodegradability and ecotoxicity. These nonionic surfactants, obtained from natural substances, are 100 % biodegradable and very suitable for washing. They are highly soluble, only slightly sensitive to electrolytes and rarely influenced by water hardness. This paper analyses the behaviour of APG and linear alkyl sulfonate, separately and in mixtures of different proportions, {{in order to show}} how dyed polyester fabric changed colour during washing and how <b>dye</b> <b>transfers</b> to white textile items (diacetate, polyamide, cotton, acrylic and wool). Before this process, the polyester was dyed with disperse dyes. Disperse dyes can become deposited on white polyester fabric during washing due to various mechanical, chemical, electrical or adsorption-related causes. In an attempt to explain the behaviour of the deposition of disperse dyes in the washing process, we assessed the total potential energy between disperse dye and polyester fabric based on the theory of heterocoagulation. The zeta potentials of the insoluble disperse dyes and the fabrics were related to the results obtained by staining white fabric during washingPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R
50|$|Science fiction fanzines used {{a variety}} of {{printing}} methods. Typewriters, school dittos, church mimeos and (if they could afford it) multi-color letterpress or other mid-to-high level printing. Some fans wanted their news spread, others reveled in the artistry and beauty of fine printing. The hectograph, introduced around 1876, was so named because it could produce (in theory) up to a hundred copies. Hecto used an aniline <b>dye,</b> <b>transferred</b> to a tray of gelatin, and paper would be placed on the gel, one sheet at a time, for transfer. Messy and smelly, the process could create vibrant colors for the few copies produced, the easiest aniline dye to make being purple (technically indigo). The next small but significant technological step after hecto is the spirit duplicator, essentially the hectography process using a drum instead of the gelatin. Introduced by Ditto Corporation in 1923, these machines were known for the next six decades as Ditto Machines and used by fans because they were cheap to use and could (with a little effort) print in color.|$|R
