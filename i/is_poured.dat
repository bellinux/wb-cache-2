5|$|Elements of {{the dessert}} course are served on dry ice, such as small round white {{chocolate}} balls of ice cream, {{which has been}} taken from the menu at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay. Other desserts on the menu include a hollow sphere of chocolate, which a hot chocolate sauce <b>is</b> <b>poured</b> over to dissolve the sphere in order to unveil the ball of milk ice cream within, and a fennel crème brûlée served with Alphonso mango. The wine list starts from around £25, and moves up to a 1961 magnum of Pétrus at £39,000.|$|E
5|$|In {{commemoration}} of Pancake Day in the United Kingdom, a novelty pancake machine {{was built by}} The Happy Egg Company in February 2013 that involved a complex series of steps to automatically produce pancakes from scratch. The machine {{involves the use of}} a freshly laid egg from a hen that rolls onto a turntable, which then moves the egg to an area where it is automatically cracked and mixed with other ingredients. After this point, the mixture <b>is</b> <b>poured</b> into a griddle, flipped to cook the other side, and then flipped onto a plate.|$|E
5|$|To pack a muzzle-loading cannon, first {{gunpowder}} <b>is</b> <b>poured</b> {{down the}} bore. This {{is followed by}} a layer of wadding (often nothing more than paper), and then the cannonball itself. A certain amount of windage allows the ball to fit down the bore, though the greater the windage the less efficient the propulsion of the ball when the gunpowder is ignited. To fire the cannon, the fuse located in the vent is lit, quickly burning down to the gunpowder, which then explodes violently, propelling wadding and ball down the bore and out of the muzzle. A small portion of exploding gas also escapes through the vent, but this does not dramatically affect the total force exerted on the ball.|$|E
50|$|The layers must <b>be</b> <b>poured</b> {{very gently}} to avoid mixing. They can <b>be</b> <b>poured</b> {{over the back}} of a spoon or down a glass rod.|$|R
30|$|This {{local road}} <b>was</b> <b>poured</b> in two stages, {{such that the}} {{eastbound}} side <b>was</b> <b>poured</b> in slightly cooler weather in the fall, and the westbound side <b>was</b> <b>poured</b> in hot summer conditions. Since the concrete mixture and pavement design were presumably the same {{as well as the}} loading, this section makes an ideal side-by-side comparison of the effects of higher concrete placement temperatures. It was examined on March 6, 2008.|$|R

5|$|Mansaf is a {{traditional}} meal in the central West Bank and Naqab region in the southern West Bank, having its roots from the Bedouin population of ancient Arabia. It is mostly cooked on occasions such as, during holidays, weddings or a large gathering. Mansaf is cooked as a lamb leg or large pieces of lamb {{on top of a}} taboon bread that has usually been smothered with yellow rice. A type of thick and dried cheesecloth yogurt from goat's milk, called jameed, <b>is</b> <b>poured</b> on top of the lamb and rice to give it its distinct flavor and taste. The dish is also garnished with cooked pine nuts and almonds. The classic form of eating mansaf is using the right hand as a utensil. For politeness, participants in the feast tear pieces of meat to hand to the person next to them.|$|E
5|$|Testaroli {{is a type}} of pancake-like pasta {{prepared}} using water, {{wheat flour}} and salt that is sliced into triangular shapes. Chestnut flour is sometimes used in its preparation. The ingredients are mixed together and prepared as a batter, after which it is cooked, sometimes using a two-stage cooking process. In the typical first stage, and sometimes only stage of cooking, the batter <b>is</b> <b>poured</b> and cooked on a hot, flat surface in the style of a pancake or crêpe. In this process, testaroli is traditionally cooked on a testo, which may be prepared for use by being heated over hot coals. A skillet is another cooking device {{that can be used to}} cook the batter. The pasta is then sliced into triangles, and is sometimes directly served after this cooking process. In the second cooking stage that is sometimes performed, the pasta may be set aside to cool, and then cooked further in boiling water.|$|E
5|$|The {{first step}} in the {{manufacture}} of a typical shoe polish is the melting of the wax with the highest melting point in an electric heater. Following this, all other waxes are added, usually by descending order of melting point. While this wax is held at a constant temperature, the emulsion—a mixture of the various oils and, if used, fats, is then heated separately, at around 85°C. The heated emulsion is then added to the waxes, along with distilled water. When the mixture reaches around 80°C, turpentine oil is added. This mixture is then mixed and continually stirred for half an hour. Dyes are added and mixed in turpentine oil if it is not a neutral polish. The mixed mass is reduced slowly to 50°C, and as its viscosity increases, it <b>is</b> <b>poured</b> through a closed funnel into a cooling chamber. The poured mass is allowed to settle slowly, providing uniform distribution. The process is considered straightforward and the required equipment is relatively easy to acquire. The cost of establishing shoe polish manufacturing facilities has been estimated at around $600,000 (as of 2005).|$|E
50|$|Soy sauce (shōyu) <b>is</b> {{not usually}} <b>poured</b> over most foods at the table; a dipping dish is usually provided.

5|$|The layers {{are then}} left to dry under the sun, {{after which the}} entire mold is heated in a furnace to melt away the wax and {{hardening}} the coal/mud mixture, leaving behind a hollowed shell. With this hardened mold, molten bronze <b>is</b> <b>poured</b> down the mold’s mouth cavity, cooled to a certain degree, then the coal/mud is broken apart, revealing a new gong. The gong is then refined, cleaned, and properly identified by the blacksmith (pandáy). Finally, the gongs are refined using the tongkol process, tuning these either by hammering the boss from the inside to slightly raise its pitch, or by hammering the boss from the outside to lower the pitch. The correct tuning is found by ear, with players striking a sequence of gongs, looking for a melodic contour they are familiar with.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} religious rite for Heathens is called blót, which constitutes a ritual in which offerings are {{provided to the}} gods. Blót typically takes place outdoors, and usually consists of an offering of mead, which is contained within a bowl. The gods are invoked and requests expressed for their aid, as the priest uses a sprig or branch of an evergreen tree to sprinkle mead onto both statues of the deities and the assembled participants. This procedure might be scripted or largely improvised. Finally, the bowl of mead <b>is</b> <b>poured</b> onto a fire, or onto the earth, as a final libation to the gods. Sometimes, a communal meal is held afterward; in some groups this is incorporated {{as part of the}} ritual itself. In other instances, the blót is simpler and less ritualized; in this case, it can involve a practitioner setting some food aside, sometimes without words, for either gods or wights. Some Heathens perform such rituals on a daily basis, although for others it is a more occasional performance. Aside from honoring deities, communal blóts also serve as a form of group bonding.|$|E
25|$|Hot-processed soaps {{are created}} by {{encouraging}} the saponification reaction by adding heat {{to speed up the}} reaction. In contrast with cold-pour soap which <b>is</b> <b>poured</b> into molds {{and for the most part}} only then saponifies, hot-process soaping for the most part saponifies the oils completely and only then <b>is</b> <b>poured</b> into molds.|$|E

5000|$|After the {{extensive}} preparatory works were complete, the first concrete for the dam <b>was</b> <b>poured</b> on October 3, 1962. Concrete <b>was</b> <b>poured</b> day and night, but was halted {{during the winter}} because of freezing temperatures. To organize the pouring, the dam was split into 45 ft plots and each was raised {{about five or six}} feet at a time. Workers had about 150 days — before seasonal flooding — to construct the dam to a height of at least 250 ft. Before flooding began, engineers planned to seal the diversion tunnels and begin filling the reservoir. To speed the pouring process, concrete <b>was</b> <b>poured</b> in casts by buckets that moved along three cableways suspended above the construction site. The deadline was met within the 150 days and a total of [...] of concrete <b>was</b> <b>poured.</b> The dam <b>was</b> eventually completed in 1968.|$|R
25|$|Waterboarding {{is a form}} {{of water}} torture in which water <b>is</b> <b>poured</b> over a cloth {{covering}} the face and breathing passages of an immobilized captive, causing the individual to experience the sensation of drowning. Ordinarily, the water <b>is</b> <b>poured</b> intermittently so as to prevent death during torture, however, if the water <b>is</b> <b>poured</b> uninterruptedly it will lead to death by asphyxia with the sensation of drowning, also called dry drowning. Besides death, waterboarding can cause extreme pain, damage to lungs, brain damage from oxygen deprivation, other physical injuries including broken bones due to struggling against restraints, and lasting psychological damage. Adverse physical consequences can manifest themselves months after the event, while psychological effects can last for years.|$|E
