500|$|As I was {{reporting}} to the Triton, I remember saying, [...] "This ship is an unusual one. We've {{got to do something}} special with it. What could it be?" [...] We talked about it a little bit, and nobody had any ideas. Finally, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> idea. We'll do a stunt. We'll go around the world from North Pole to South Pole. That was my brainstorm. If {{you take a look at}} a map of the world, you'll see that's not a very easy way to go. [...] So we didn't do that. But I do remember thinking of it. And I made a speech to the crew, advising them of my thinking—that we were going to put this ship on the map. Well, that died out. Suddenly ... a phone call came, asking me if I could be in Washington tomorrow.|$|E
500|$|During {{practice}} for the 1980 Indianapolis 500, Richmond set the fastest unofficial practice speed of the month, besting even race favorite Johnny Rutherford in the vaunted Chaparral. His hopes for the pole were dashed with a crash in morning practice {{on the first day}} of qualifying. After repairs he qualified 19th for the race. He worked his way up to the top 10 during the race, led a lap, and finished ninth as he ran out of fuel at the end of the race. To the delight of the crowd, winner Rutherford gave him a ride back to the pits. He was named the 1980 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year. [...] "I busted up a few Indy cars right after that," [...] he said. [...] "Milwaukee, Mid-Ohio... at Michigan I cut one in two. I was afraid my racing career would come to a halt. So when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> offer to drive stock cars, I took it, and it turned out I liked driving them better." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1933 Terry-Thomas {{had moved}} out of Finchley and into a friend's flat; the friend was a film extra who {{introduced}} him to the idea of working in the industry. Terry-Thomas made his uncredited film debut in the 1933 film, The Private Life of Henry VIII, which starred Charles Laughton in the title role. Between 1933 and 1941 Terry-Thomas appeared in 16films, as an uncredited extra in all but one; he later said that [...] "this work suited me down to the ground. It wasn't really like work to me. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> enormous kick out of it". His first speaking role came in the 1935 Buddy Rogers comedy Once in a Million where he shouted [...] "A thousand!" [...] during an auction. During the 1936 musical comedy This'll Make You Whistle, starring Jack Buchanan, he permanently damaged his hearing as a result of jumping into a water tank. In between his film work, he developed his cabaret act and was employed as a dance teacher at the Aida Foster School of Dancing in Golders Green.|$|E

500|$|Feldman has {{admitted}} in several interviews {{that he has}} been the victim of people who email him to explain psychiatric symptoms, only to divulge eventually that they created it all to fool a doctor. For prolonged cases, he states the impetus for such behavior is the [...] "longing for nurturing, sympathy, care and concern that they feel unable to get in appropriate ways," [...] and that the admiration of forum members is a strong motivator to continue. As manipulation is integral to most cases, the need to control others to feel as if the perpetrator is in control {{of his or her own}} life is apparent, as is the pre-existence of underlying personality disorders. Many people who present factitious disorders crave sympathy and support because it was notably absent in childhood. In a story published in The Village Voice in 2001, a woman recovering from factitious disorder remembered her drive to create conditions that did not exist: [...] "When I'd do something to attract the paramedics and police, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> adrenaline rush. I believe I got addicted to it. At the time, it didn't occur to me I was hurting anyone but myself." [...] A psychologist who was a member of the support group for premature infants stated in The New York Times article, [...] "People who do this need something. I wonder if it's a metaphor for some other loss she experienced and is playing over and over again in different shapes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cinemation's {{advertising}} {{style and}} the film's rating led many to believe that Fritz the Cat was a pornographic film. When it was introduced as such at a showing at the University of Southern California, Bakshi stated firmly, [...] "Fritz the Cat is not pornographic." [...] In May 1972, Variety reported that Krantz had appealed the X rating, saying [...] "Animals having sex isn't pornography." [...] The MPAA refused to hear the appeal. The misconceptions about the film's content were eventually cleared up when it received praise from Rolling Stone and The New York Times, and the film was accepted into the 1972 Cannes Film Festival. Bakshi later stated, [...] "Now they do as much on The Simpsons as <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> X rating for Fritz the Cat." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1861, Williamson {{worked for}} the local theatre company of Messrs. Hurd and Perkins as call-boy, general {{assistant}} and scenery and props maker. [...] There he made his official stage debut. [...] He later recalled: [...] "I used to act in amateur theatricals, and when I was sixteen <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> engagement with a company at the Milwaukee theatre. I was full of energy and enthusiasm, and did pretty well everything. My mornings were spent in learning fencing and dancing. In the afternoon I'd look after the box office, and at evening help the stage manager and take my part – sometimes three or four parts." [...] The next year, he joined the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Toronto, Canada and {{then moved on to}} New York where he found work as a dialect comedian and then played for several years at Wallack's Theatre. [...] From his seven-year apprenticeship there, Williamson emerged with a thorough knowledge of acting, play production and stage management. [...] He then played in a musical comedy at the Theatre Comique in New York under the management of W. H. Lingard. [...] Although Williamson was not a good singer, his talent for comedy carried him.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{believed}} that Lynch was going to retire from the film industry; according to Abel Ferrara, Lynch [...] "doesn't even want to make films any more. I've {{talked to him about}} it, OK? I can tell when he talks about it." [...] However, in a June 2012 Los Angeles Times interview, Lynch stated that he lacked the inspiration to start a new movie project, but [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> idea that I fell in love with, I'd go to work tomorrow". In September 2012, Lynch appeared in the three-part [...] "Late Show" [...] arc on FX's Louie as Jack Dahl. In November 2012, Lynch hinted at plans for a new film while attending Plus Camerimage in Bydgoszcz, Poland. Speaking at the festival, Lynch said [...] "something is coming up. It will happen but I don't know exactly when". At Plus Camerimage, Lynch was also presented with a lifetime achievement award and the key to the city by Bydgoszcz's mayor Rafał Bruski. During an interview with the Los Angeles Times in January 2013, frequent Lynch collaborator Laura Dern confirmed she and Lynch are planning a new project, and The New York Times later revealed Lynch is working on the script. Idem Paris, a short documentary film about the lithographic process, was released online in February 2013. On June 28, 2013, a music video directed by Lynch for the Nine Inch Nails song [...] "Came Back Haunted" [...] was released. He also did photography for the self-titled album from Dumb Numbers released August 2013.|$|E
2500|$|On February 5, 1985, twin {{brothers}} Bill and Bob Clark sighted a 60+ {{foot long}} sea serpent in San Francisco Bay that crashed onto a submerged rocky ledge only 20 {{yards away from}} where {{they were sitting in}} their car. It was around 7:45 a.m. and the water was calm. The Clark brothers were sitting in their car drinking coffee when they noticed a group of seals in the water. Then they noticed what they thought was another seal approach the group. The group of seals began to swim away and one of them headed for the seawall where the Clarks were parked. The seals were followed by the creature and according to Bob, [...] "Bill started saying it was moving strange. He said it was not a seal, it's a snake." [...] Bob continued, [...] "We watched it coming in, undulating in a vertical manner. Where most snakes undulate side to side, this was up and down, creating humps in the water. Bob said, [...] "The seals were leaping through the water in front of it. I think it was going to eat them. It was behind the seals arched above the water line and I could tell it was a large animal when the arch appeared to stay in one spot. I could see the body moving through the arch." [...] The Clarks said the water was so clear that morning they could easily see the creature as it undulated at amazing speed like an uncoiling whip. [...] They both estimated the length of the creature to be at least 60 feet. As it swam over the submerged rocky ledge it stopped dead in its tracks then it appeared to slide a few feet across the water creating a light spray. It apparently got stuck on the rocks. Bob said the animal turned clockwise and exposed its midsection. [...] "It turned over like a corkscrew in midsection. We could see the belly of the animal. It reminded me of an alligator stomach, creamy white, soft leathery looking, but with a tint of yellow in it." [...] He continued saying, [...] "After it twisted over and showed the underbelly, another section behind the underbelly came up about three feet out of the water. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> excellent view of a fin-type appendage, which opened up like an accordion fan. It stayed up about five seconds, long enough for me to tell my brother, 'Bill, I'm going to look at it as long as I can so I can remember it.' [...] " [...] After it twisted the midsection off of the submerged rocky ledge, Bill said they watched the creature sit [...] "motionless in the water for five or ten seconds". Then it began to swim away, using a [...] "violent, downward thrust of its upper neck which sent a pack of coils backwards towards the midsection. After a few seconds of undulations, the creature moved rapidly, just {{below the surface of the}} water northward toward deeper water in the middle of the Bay." [...] Bill concluded his account by saying, [...] "I don't care if anyone believes me. I know what I saw. It was too mind-blowing and close to me not to say something about it." ...|$|E
