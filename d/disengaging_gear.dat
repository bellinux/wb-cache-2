40|$|Abstract: There is a {{potential}} to save fuel for heavy trucks by storing kinetic energy in the vehicle when driving downhill, because the speed adds kinetic energy to the vehicle {{which can be used}} after the downhill slope to propell the vehicle. This behavior can be even more utilized by <b>disengaging</b> the <b>gear</b> to reduce the friction in the driveline and thus increase the speed even more. Two dierent control strategies to choose when to <b>disengage</b> the <b>gear</b> is presented: One that uses instantaneous inclination and one predictive control scheme that uses look ahead information of the road topology. Simulation results show that gear disengagement in downhills can reduce the fuel consumption about 3 %. Copyright c 2005 IFA...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Disengaging</b> <b>Gear</b> {{was invented}} by Mark Heaton Robinson (1844-1923) who was a {{prolific}} inventor, and who is {{perhaps best known for}} his developments in the area of single-acting high-speed steam engines.|$|E
25|$|In {{conjunction}} with London Transport from 1937 Leyland developed the Tiger FEC, the initials stood for flat-engined coach. The Leyland 8.6-litre engine (with revised sump) was mounted horizontally in mid wheel-base driving through a Wilson fluid-flywheel and an air-actuated AEC mechanical pre-selector gearbox. The gearbox was {{basically the same}} as used in the STL but it was fitted with an externally mounted air cylinder which actuated the bus bar to engage and <b>disengage</b> the <b>gears.</b> It worked in the opposite way from that in the slightly later RT type double decker in that air pressure was used to <b>disengage</b> the <b>gears</b> instead of being used to keep them engaged. When the gear change pedal was released it allowed the selected gear to engage by means of spring pressure in that {{same way as the}} gearbox in the STL. The system caused problems in that if a vehicle was left with a gear engaged and the air pressure leaked off {{it was not possible to}} <b>disengage</b> that <b>gear</b> until air pressure had been built up again. Because of this, there were a number of garage incidents caused by vehicles being left overnight with a gear still engaged. 88 of this type were built and 12 were destroyed during World War Two, the rest serving until 1954-5 as Green Line coaches.|$|R

50|$|The Robinson's <b>Disengaging</b> <b>Gear</b> is {{a system}} for safely {{releasing}} a small seaboat into the sea from a larger ship. The Robinson's <b>Disengaging</b> <b>Gear</b> has been standard equipment on British Royal Navy ships since 1880. The term seaboat is used here to describe a work boat that is used in everyday ship operations for transferring people, inspecting other vessels, etc. A seaboat is different from a lifeboat, which is only used in an emergency to save lives. Historically, a sea boat was also used as a lifeboat, but today (2014) lifeboats are usually specialized boats, not used for everyday work.|$|E

5000|$|Several {{solutions}} that would mechanically simultaneously release both falls were proposed. The British Royal Navy adopted and standardized on the Robinson's <b>Disengaging</b> <b>Gear</b> in 1881, and this system {{was still in}} use in the late 20th century.The Robinson's <b>Disengaging</b> <b>Gear</b> consists of three mechanisms. There are two disengaging hooks, one {{at each end of}} the seaboat, holding the boat to the falls. The two disengaging hooks are connected by a relatively tight and thin wire rope to the disengaging release clip located approximately at the center of the seaboat. The thin connecting wire rope is called the [...] "Fore and After". The disengaging hooks are normally held safe from unintentionally dropping the seaboat by a pin in each disengaging hook.|$|E
50|$|As {{was typical}} of such computers, {{flipping}} a lever on the handcrank's support casting enabled automatic reception of data and <b>disengaged</b> the handcrank <b>gear.</b> Flipped the other way, the gear engaged, and power was cut to the receiver's servo motor.|$|R
50|$|The gear {{selector}} does not engage or <b>disengage</b> the actual <b>gear</b> teeth which are permanently meshed. Rather, {{the action of}} the {{gear selector}} is to lock one of the freely spinning gears to the shaft that runs through its hub. The shaft then spins together with that gear. The output shaft's speed relative to the countershaft is determined by the ratio of the two gears: the one permanently attached to the countershaft, and that gear's mate which is now locked to the output shaft.|$|R
5000|$|A {{series of}} major {{revisions}} came in 2012. The KX450F received an all new frame, significant engine modifications {{and a new}} electronics set that included Launch Control. Launch Control is designed to prevent wheel-spin at take off, and automatically <b>disengages</b> once third <b>gear</b> is reached. It is activated by holding a switch until an indicator light glows green, {{at which point the}} bikes computer modifies acceleration factors. Kawasaki has continued to insist since inception (for safety reasons) that this system is not traction control but a unique system onto itself.|$|R

5000|$|Robinson's <b>Disengaging</b> <b>Gear</b> {{was used}} in the Royal Navy through the 1970s in the Type 12 frigates, the Leander class frigates, and the County class guided missile destroyers. The {{standard}} seaboat was a 26 foot [...] "3 in 1" [...] whaler with an inboard diesel engine, and a crew of 6. [...] After that time the Royal Navy wanted to reduce the overall crew size on ships, and so switched to smaller seaboats, launched from a single wire crane. The new single wire system was released with the new Henriksen Hook. The Henriksen Hook releases the boat automatically when the boat touches the water, and the boat weight on the suspension line is relieved. [...] The Hendrikson Hook is now standard on Royal Navy ships (2015).|$|E
5000|$|The Nimbin is {{a vessel}} of [...] with {{a length of}} 215 ft, a width of 35 ft, and a depth of 13 ft.

50|$|Neutral / No <b>gear</b> (N): This <b>disengages</b> all <b>gear</b> trains {{within the}} transmission, {{effectively}} disconnecting the transmission from the driven wheels, allowing {{the vehicle to}} coast freely under its own weight and gain momentum without the motive force from the engine. Coasting in idle down long grades (where law permits) should be avoided, though, with many transmission designs as the transmission's lubrication pump is commonly driven by the input (engine) side, which may not provide sufficient fluid flow at engine idle speed for high-speed travel. Similarly, emergency towing (with the driven wheels of the disabled and non-running vehicle on the ground) with an automatic transmission in neutral is not permitted by the manufacturer for many vehicles. Manufacturers understand emergency situations and list limitations of towing a vehicle in neutral (usually not to exceed 55 mph and 50 miles). This is the only other selection in which the vehicle's engine may be started.|$|R
50|$|The gearbox {{differed}} {{little from}} the RC30’s; in fact, it {{even had the}} same gear ratios with only the primary and secondary ratios changed. The one-way sprag clutch was also carried over from the RC30 but was of NR750 design. This sprag clutch was a forerunner to today’s slipper clutches affording a slight amount of slip on overrun {{in the attempt to}} stop the back wheel from locking. The clutch plates were also from the NR750 and were much larger in diameter compared to the ones used in the RC30. The first gear was so tall that the increase in clutch plate diameter improved their longevity. All gears in the RC45’s gearbox were undercut to reduce the chance of a <b>gear</b> <b>disengaging.</b>|$|R
40|$|In an {{automated}} manual transmission it is desired to have zero torque in the transmission when <b>disengaging</b> a <b>gear.</b> This minimizes the oscillations in the driveline which increases the comfort and makes the speed synchronization easier. The {{automated manual transmission}} system in a Scania truck, called Opticruise, uses engine torque control to achieve zero torque in the transmission. In this thesis different control strategies for engine torque control are proposed {{in order to minimize}} the oscillations in the driveline and increase the comfort during a gear shift. A model of the driveline is developed in order to evaluate the control strategies. The main focus was to develop controllers that are easy to implement and that are robust enough to be used in different driveline configurations. This means that model dependent control strategies are not considered. A control strategy with a combination of a feedback from the speed difference between the output shaft speed and the wheel speed, and a feedforward with a linear ramp, showed very good performance in both simulations and tests in trucks. The amplitude of the oscillations in the output shaft speed after neutralengagement are halved compared to the results from the existing method in Scania trucks. The new concept is also more robust against initial conditions and time delay estimations...|$|R
5|$|The 37mm M5 gun had a {{manually}} operated breechblock. The tank commander doubled as loader, {{like many other}} tanks of the time. There was no turret basket in the M2A4 light tank; the commander stood on the right side, while the gunner stood on the left side. The commander turned the turret onto {{the general direction of}} target. The gunner would then bring the target into the M5 telescopic sight. The M20 combination mount had 20° of traverse; this could either be by a handwheel driving the rack and pinion traverse gear mechanism or pressure on the gunners shoulder rest overcoming the friction in the mechanism. Depression and elevation of the gun was either through a geared mechanism or, with the <b>gears</b> <b>disengaged,</b> free through movement of the gunner's shoulder rest.|$|R
40|$|A {{proof of}} concept of a {{continuously}} variable rotor speed control methodology for rotorcraft is described. Variable rotor speed is desirable for several reasons including improved maneuverability, agility, and noise reduction. However, it {{has been difficult to}} implement because turboshaft engines are designed to operate within a narrow speed band, and a reliable drive train that can provide continuous power over a wide speed range does not exist. The new methodology proposed here is a sequential shifting control for twin-engine rotorcraft that coordinates the disengagement and engagement of the two turboshaft engines {{in such a way that}} the rotor speed may vary over a wide range, but the engines remain within their prescribed speed bands and provide continuous torque to the rotor; two multi-speed gearboxes facilitate the wide rotor speed variation. The shifting process begins when one engine slows down and disengages from the transmission by way of a standard freewheeling clutch mechanism; the other engine continues to apply torque to the rotor. Once one engine <b>disengages,</b> its <b>gear</b> shifts, the multi-speed gearbox output shaft speed resynchronizes and it re-engages. This process is then repeated with the other engine. By tailoring the sequential shifting, the rotor may perform large, rapid speed changes smoothly, as demonstrated in several examples. The emphasis of this effort is on the coordination and control aspects for {{proof of concept}}. The engines, rotor, and transmission are all simplified linear models, integrated to capture the basic dynamics of the problem...|$|R
50|$|The {{design team}} {{set out to}} create a 6 speed {{automatic}} that fits in the same space as a manual gearbox. It measures 358 mm in length and weighs 90 kg. Its combined use of a conventional 5-pinion planetary gearset and a compound Ravigneaux gearset makes it incredibly light and compact. This combination {{is known as a}} Lepelletier arrangement. The shifting of gears is managed by a sophisticated computer programme which oversees a clutch-to-clutch actuation. Gear changes are accomplished by one clutch engaging the instant the clutch from the previous <b>gear</b> <b>disengages.</b> The transmission control module (TCM) is located inside the transmission housing, instead of being located outside it. The advantage of this is to reduce external wiring as well as to provide a constant environment for TCM operation which encourages longevity. One aspect of the advanced nature of the electronics is at idle (along with required foot brake depression on e.g. Opel Astra), it automatically selects neutral gear to reduce internal temperatures and improve fuel economy.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Conventional {{transmission}} system uses {{single plate clutch}} with a manual transmission <b>gear</b> box. <b>Disengage</b> clutch, Change <b>gear,</b> Gradually engage clutch thus three operations are to be performed while moving from one gear to another, hence in all 15 operations are performed {{to move to the}} top gear, {{it is important to note}} out of the 15 operations performed to reach the top gear… 10 operations are clutch operations, hence making clutch operations automatic will reduce human effort. Automatic clutch control has another advantage, i. e, out of three pedals ie, one of accelerator pedal, Brake Pedal, Clutch pedal eliminating the clutch pedal will lead to easy driving as the controls become simple. Many methods of automatic clutch control namely electro-magnetic clutch, pneumatic clutch control etc have been tried but due inherent disadvantages and maintenance problems they have been replaced back by conventional method. The auto-disengagement single clutch employs only one set of compression springs instead of the usual two sets, with this arrangement it is possible to reduce the weights of the centrifugal members. The modified system utilizes the centrifugal force developed by engine acceleration, whereas the temporary dis-engagement of clutch required at the time of gear change is a solenoid actuated by switch in gear change knob. The hold time of the solenoid is only a few seconds thus prolongs solenoid life and reduces power consumption from battery...|$|R
