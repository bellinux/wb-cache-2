50|$|On {{post-mortem}} examination (necropsy), {{the most obvious}} gross lesion is subcutaneous oedema in the submandibular and pectoral (brisket) regions. Petechial haemorrhages are found subcutaneously and in the thoracic cavity. In addition, congestion and various degrees of consolidation of the lung may occur. Animals that die within 24-36 hours, have only few petechial haemorrhages on the heart and generalised congestion of the lung, while in animals that die after 72 hours, petechial and <b>ecchymotic</b> <b>haemorrhages</b> were more evident and lung consolidation are more extensive.|$|R
40|$|An 11 -year-old female German Shepherd dog {{presented}} with lethargy and anorexia, which progressed to haemorrhagic vomiting, diarrhoea and seizures. Serum biochemistry and haematology results showed azotaemia and mild thrombocytopaenia. Euthanasia was elected {{and the dog}} was submitted for necropsy examination. There were widespread serosal and mucosal petechial and <b>ecchymotic</b> <b>haemorrhages</b> within the abdomen, with ascites and multiple renal infarcts. The renal infarcts were associated with fibrinoid necrosis and thrombosis of inter-lobular arteries and arterioles. These arterial lesions and clinical signs are consistent with haemolytic-uraemic syndrome, which has not previously been reported in dogs in Europe...|$|R
40|$|In {{a private}} fresh water pond of one acre size, 3900 numbers of carps {{consisting}} of Catla (Catla catla), Rohu (Labeo rohita), Grass carps (Ctenopharyngodon idella), Mrigal (Cirrhinus mriqala)) and Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were cultured at Orathanadu, Thanjavur, the aquaculture belt of Tamilnadu. The bacterial haemorrhagic septicaemia disease outbreak due to Aeromonas hydrophila {{in a fresh}} water carps pond was investigated in the year 2011. The clinical signs included anorexia, slow movement in water surface, chronic rubbing of body due to irritation, 16 % mortality and 100 % morbidity. Bacteriological examination of moribund fish and traditional biochemical methods were used for identification of A. hydrophila. The gross and hisopathological changes were studied. The vascular changes such as congestion and hemorrhage in the outside surface of the affected fish were the main gross lesion. Petechial and <b>ecchymotic</b> <b>haemorrhages,</b> erosions and ulcers {{were found in the}} skin. The vascular changes such as congestion and haemorrhages were recorded in the mouths, eyes, opercula and the base of fins and around the anus. The blood tinched serous fluid was recorded in the abdomen. The vital organs showed generalized congestion and enlargement with petechial and <b>ecchymotic</b> <b>haemorrhages.</b> The histopathological changes are characterized by generalised haemosiderine pigment deposition in all vital organs. In addition, vacuolar degeneration and necrosis in the dermis and subcutis, congestion and haemohhages with serous exudation in gill-lamellae, acute haemorrhagic myocarditis, cloudy swelling to hydropic degeneration with multifocal necrosis of liver, acute haemorrhagic enteritis and acute haemorrhagic nephritis were observed.

40|$|A 4 -year-old female koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) {{was seen}} on the ground about 40 hours after capture and release for routine survey purposes. It died shortly afterwards. A 5 -month-old infant koala in its pouch was alive but died 36 hours later despite regular feeding with a milk supplement. PM {{examination}} of the adult revealed congestion and haemorrhage in lymph nodes, lungs, myocardium, kidneys and adrenal glands as well as <b>ecchymotic</b> <b>haemorrhages</b> on most serosal surfaces. Histological changes included necrotic foci in liver and spleen. A brown pigment which is a feature of normal koala liver was present in hepatocytes generally. Distinctive eosinophilic intranuclear hepatocyte inclusions were present which were unrelated to necrotic foci. Occasional bacterial colonies {{were associated with the}} necrotic foci. Gram negative bacteria were seen in liver, spleen and lung sections. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas pseudomallei were isolated from liver and kidney samples.

40|$|A disease {{outbreak}} {{was investigated in}} a commercial broiler parent stock farm. The outbreak began at the mid of May 2000 and continued more than one month. During the period mortality was recorded around 4 % in the affected shed, flock strength of which was 5000 birds. During post mortem examination the pericardial sac was found engorged with straw colour pericardial fluid. Numerous subcapsular petechial and <b>ecchymotic</b> <b>haemorrhages</b> were seen in liver. No bacterial growth was found after 48 hours of incubation on Muller-Hinton and MacConkey agar surfaces inoculated from the pathological sample. But poor viral growth was recorded in chick embryo fibroblast cell culture propagated inoculums making from heart and liver. Harvested virus using as antigen source from the growth was found reacted positively in agar gel precipitation test with reference conventional adenovirus polyvalent antiserum. Two of the four randomly collected serum samples of the affected flock at day 20 of the outbreak were also found reacting positively with the known reference antigen produced by the same institute. Not having the type specific antiserum the present study failed to elucidate the stereotype (s) that involved in the said outbreak. Nevertheless, the study {{seems to be the}} first report of adenoviral induced hydropericardium-hepatitis syndrome or leechi heart disease affecting chicken in Bangladesh...|$|R
40|$|Enzootic bovine haematuria {{is mainly}} caused by the chronic {{ingestion}} of bracken fern and is still considered an important cause of economic losses in beef herds, particularly in large metropolitan areas of Brazil that are not suitable for agriculture (weak soil, steep hills). The aim {{of this paper was}} evaluate if there is a correlation between the degree of haematuria and the presence of lesions in the urinary bladder of cows with bovine enzootic haematuria (BEH). We evaluated the bladder of twenty Nelore cows with bracken fern intoxication using a flexible endoscope to describe the lesions present and we performed a rapid urine test with a chemical multiple-reagent commercial strips (Combur test Roche® – Swiss) to check the degree of haematuria; then we correlated both results with the Spearman statistical test. All cows presented lesions in their bladder walls and the urine was visually reddish and positive for haematuria in the strips. Urine dipstick has shown to correlate with bladder lesion number. In the bladders of the euthanised animals, multiple sub-mucosal reddish nodules and multiple <b>ecchymotic</b> <b>haemorrhages</b> were seen macroscopically, and one bladder had a larger tumour with a 3 cm diameter, which was determined to be a haemangioma by analysing the histopathology. We concluded that urine dipstick is a valuable device for bovine enzootic haematuria prognostic purposes and to evaluate the severity of lesions from the urinary bladder. Moreover, cystoscopy is an important diagnostic tool to assess bladder lesions in cattle. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the involvement of papillomaviruses and bladder tumour occurrence in these cows. ...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a report}} on the {{clinical}} signs of Wesselsbron disease in 37 lambs and the pathology of 4 natural and 12 experimental cases. Generally the symptoms were ill-defined. At autopsy 13 of the 14 lambs revealed a mild to severe icterus and a slight to moderate hepatomegaly with discoloration of the liver. No foci of hepatic necrosis were observed macroscopically and, except for petechial and <b>ecchymotic</b> <b>haemorrhages</b> in the mucosa of the abomasum and generalized lymphadenopathy, no other obvious macroscopic lesions were noted. Perforation of the abomasum occurred in one lamb only. Microscopy on the liver showed mild to extensive necrosis of the parenchyma. Degenerated and necrotic hepatocytes were diffusely scattered throughout the liver, but no definite well-circumscribed foci of necrosis were seen. Mitotic figures and hepatocytes with large nuclei indicated that active regeneration of parenchymal cells had occurred in some of the livers. Other changes, for example, Kupffer cell proliferation, sinusoidal leucostasis, bile duct proliferation and infiltration of mononuclear cells in the portal triads, were frequently encountered. Moderate to severe cholestasis was a feature in 66 % of the livers examined, while intranuclear inclusions and intracytoplasmic acidophilic or Councilman-like bodies were frequently observed. A complete haematological study was carried out on 4 experimentally produced cases. The gross and histopathological lesions in the liver are compared with those of Rift Valley fever in the new-born lamb. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 300 dpi.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to assess the role of glucose, bilirubin, cholesterol and alkaline phosphatase as aetiological factors in parturient haemoglobinuria (PHU) in buffaloes and gross and histopathological changes taking place in this disease. For this purpose, 120 buffaloes, including 60 PHU affected and 60 apparently healthy buffaloes were used. These animals were subjected to collection of blood, urine and tissue samples. Blood glucose, serum total bilirubin and serum alkaline phosphatase concentrations in PHU affected buffaloes were significantly higher (P< 0. 05) than in healthy buffaloes. The colour of urine in PHU affected buffaloes ranged from red, dark red to coffee coloured and its pH was strongly alkaline. Urine of affected buffaloes was positive for haemoglobin (100 %) and albumin (95 %) but negative for sugar and ketone bodies. Microscopic examination of urine of affected buffaloes revealed no intact erythrocytes. Grossly, carcasses of buffaloes died of PHU were anaemic and jaundiced. Kidneys, liver and spleen were pale, enlarged and congested. Liver was friable and swollen. Epicardium and endocardium showed <b>ecchymotic</b> <b>haemorrhages.</b> Lungs were emphysemated and oedematous. Histopathologically, kidneys showed necrosis of tubular epithelium and deposition of casts alongwith atrophy of glomeruli. Liver exhibited centrilobular necrosis, haemorrhages and congestion. There was haemosiderin deposition in kidneys, liver and spleen. Heart muscles showed degenerative changes, whereas lungs were haemorrhagic, congested and emphysemated. It was concluded that significantly high blood glucose, serum total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase were found in PHU affected buffaloes.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of Pasteurella multocida strains among 275 backyard chickens from {{different regions of}} Upper Egypt was studied. A total of 21 isolates of P. multocida were recovered in 21 out of 275 chickens tested (7. 6 %) and were confirmed using phenotypic characterisation. Somatic serotyping of the 21 isolates resulted in 12 isolates being classed as serotype A: 1 (57. 14 %), 4 as serotype A: 3 (19. 05 %) and 5 could not be typed (23. 8 %). Capsular typing, using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), demonstrated that 18 strains were capsular type A (85. 7 %), and 3 were type D (14. 3 %). The present findings suggest that a multiplex capsular PCR could be valuable for the rapid identification of P. multocida in cases of fowl cholera infection. A total of 5 isolates of P. multocida were selected to study their pathogenicity in embryonated chicken eggs instead of conducting a study in mature chickens. The results showed a variation in pathogenicity between the strains tested, namely: serotype A: 1 strains caused 80 % mortality, in contrast to 20 % mortality by type D strains. Pathological findings included severe congestion of the entire embryo, haemorrhaging of the skin, feather follicles and toe, and <b>ecchymotic</b> <b>haemorrhages</b> on the liver of the inoculated embryos. The observations in {{this study indicate that}} P. multocida serogroup A could be highly pathogenic for mature chickens and therefore might be a cause of considerable economic losses in commercial production. A total of 10 isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration of 7 antimicrobials.

40|$|Yellow-eyed {{penguins}} {{have suffered}} major population declines and periodic mass mortality without an established cause. On Stewart Island a {{high incidence of}} regional chick mortality was associated with infection by a novel Leucocytozoon sp. The prevalence, structure and molecular characteristics of this leucocytozoon sp. were examined in the 2006 - 07 breeding season. In 2006 - 07, 100 % of chicks (n= 32) on the Anglem coast of Stewart Island died prior to fledging. Neonates showed poor growth and died acutely at approximately 10 days old. Clinical signs in older chicks up to 108 days included anaemia, loss of body condition, subcutaneous <b>ecchymotic</b> <b>haemorrhages</b> and sudden death. Infected adults on Stewart Island showed no clinical signs and were in good body condition, suggesting adequate food availability and a potential reservoir source of ongoing infections. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) survey of blood samples from the South Island, Stewart and Codfish Island found Leucocytozoon infection exclusively on Stewart Island. The prevalence of Leucocytozoon infection in yellow-eyed penguin populations from each island ranged from 0 - 2. 8 % (South Island), to 0 - 21. 25 % (Codfish Island) and 51. 6 - 97. 9 % (Stewart Island). The high prevalence on Stewart Island represented the infection of 100 % of chicks and 83 % of adult yellow-eyed penguins when tested by PCR. Sequencing of Leucocytozoon sp. DNA found similarities between infections in yellow-eyed penguin adults and chicks, but differences to Leucocytozoon sp. DNA obtained from Fiordland crested penguins. These findings support the suggestion of cross infection between adults and chicks, and indicate that endemic infection in yellow-eyed penguins is unrelated to that in Fiordland crested penguins. Examination by histology and electron microscopy showed tissue megaloschizonts and circulating round gametocytes. Megaloschizonts up to 440 µm diameter showed an affinity for hepatic and splenic tissue and were observed releasing occasional intact cytomeres. Round gametocytes were observed within leucocytes in visceral sections, but not peripheral blood smears. The morphology of Leucocytozoon sp. in yellow-eyed penguins showed similarities to the pathogenic species L. simondi and L. sakharoffi but not L. tawaki. A successful treatment protocol for leucocytozoonosis has not been established, although treatment in a Fiordland crested penguin was able to suppress parasitaemia. The role of Leucocytozoon in yellow-eyed penguins as a cause of morbidity and mortality remains unclear. Further investigation into direct pathogenicity, and the interaction of concurrent disease and environmental influences is required. The findings of this thesis provide potential management recommendations and highlight areas requiring further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Beetroot, goosefoot, spinach, beet, hondebossie, spinasie. DISTRIBUTION: Beetroot {{is mainly}} {{cultivated}} for human consumption, while Goosefoot occurs as a weed in disturbed places. Spinach mostly cultivated for human consumption. Low grade quality sometimes {{used as a}} stock feed. BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION: Vegetables that are planted primarily for human consumption. The seedlings of C. album look woolly on the upper side and are usually purple underneath. Under certain growing conditions the centres of young plants are are bright purple. The young leaves have a waxy coating. TOXIC PRINCIPLE: Can contain oxalates (as well as nitrates/nitrites) in dangerous concentrations. Depends on fertilization, growth stage, etc. Nitrate / Nitrite. MECHANISM OF ACTION: In the rumen nitrate is reduced to nitrite and following absorption haemoglobin is oxidised to methaemoglobin. TOXICITY: • Great variations both inter- and intraspecies • Nitrate - c. 0, 5 g/kg sheep - 5 g/kg cattle • Nitrite - c. 20 mg/kg sheep - 100 mg/kg cattle. SYNDROMES: Soluble oxalate poisoning, Nitrate/nitrite poisoning, primary nephropathy. SYSTEMS AFFECTED: Haemopoietic and urogenital systems. CLINICAL SIGNS: Urogenital acute poisoning: • Hypocalcaemia phase: -soon after intake, 2 - 6 hours - Weakness - Paresis to paralysis, semi-comatose, “milk fever” signs - Head thrown back onto shoulder - Bradycardia - Mortalities Treatment of these symptoms with Ca-borogluconate gives good results and animals may recover. • Kidney failure phase: Following day to few days later due to blockage and damage of tubuli by Ca-oxalate crystals resulting in: - Uraemia: BUN and creatinine increase - Oliguria or anuria Treatment of very little value - irreversible condition. Epidemiology: Acute poisoning happens where: - unadapted animals suddenly eat a relatively large amount of oxalate containing plants and the oxalates are absorbed into the circulation - excessive large amounts of oxalates are absorbed in adapted animals which {{are not able to}} detoxify all the oxalates in the rumen (e. g. large amounts during droughts). Chronic effect characterized by: • Calcium deficiency resulting in: - bone abnormality, - poor milk production and - poor growth. Kidney- and bladder stones where oxalates can play a role amongst other things. Haemopoietic acute poisoning: • Respiratory System: - hyperpnoea - dyspnoea, - anoxia precipitated by exercise. • Cardiovascular System: - cardiovascular failure, - syncope, - cyanosis, - methaemoglobinaemia: blood & mucous membranes a dirty chocolate brown colour. - Rapid weak pulse (drop in blood pressure) • Central Nervous System: - tremors, - weakness, - ataxia, - terminal convulsions (brain anoxia) • Gastrointestinal Tract: - diarrhoea, - salivation (vomition) • Abortion - especially last trimester. NECROPSY: Urogenital Macroscopical findings: • Hypocalcaemia: - Nothing significant, - haemorrhages. • Nephrosis and Uraemia: - Ascites, hydrothorax, perirenal and subcutaneous oedema. - Kidneys pale, oedematous, swollen - nephrosis. - Ammonia and urea odour (uraemia). - Haemorrhages in different organs. - Oedema and haemorrhages in rumen. HISTOPATHOLOGY: Typical oxalate crystals in kidney tubules (seen under polarized light) with signs of kidney damage. Haemopoietic macroscopical findings: • Cyanosis • Tarry, dark, red-brown to brown blood• Tissues and mucous membranes brown (Not apparent in every case) • Congestion • Petechial and <b>ecchymotic</b> <b>haemorrhages</b> on mucosal, visceral and serosal surfaces Histopathology: • Nothing unusual or pathognomonic. TREATMENT: Urogenital Treatment of little value - irreversible condition. CONTROL: • Avoid sudden exposure to oxalate containing plants or intake of large quantities • Avoid oxalate containing plants as the only food • Feed Ca 2 + in the form of dicalcium phosphate as a lick (25 % or more with salt) or mixed in the supplementary feeding.
