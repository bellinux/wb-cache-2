25|$|Coleridge also faced {{personal}} {{challenges in}} carrying out the scheme. He {{received a letter from}} Mary Evans which argued against the plan, and his feelings for her for a time swayed him against Pantisocracy. Learning that she had become engaged, Coleridge turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> to Pantisocracy and Sara Fricker. Under pressure from Southey to act with regard to Sara (both because of the demands of Pantisocracy and also because she was being courted by other men), Coleridge married Sara in October 1795.|$|E
25|$|Kamber turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> to {{politics}} in 1992. He supported the U.S presidential candidacy of Sen. Tom Harkin. Although {{he did not}} become involved in a presidential campaign {{to the extent that}} he did in 1984, Kamber nevertheless played a big role in the 1992 election. In July of that year, he established a political action committee called Americans for Change. The group's goal was to raise $1 million to run attack ads against President George H. W. Bush.|$|E
25|$|Husky Oil {{was born}} during the Depression {{through the efforts}} of Glenn Nielson, an Alberta farmer driven to {{bankruptcy}} when the bank called a loan on his farm. Nielson had moved to Cody, Wyoming, by the time he founded Husky as a refining operation. He turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> to Canada after the second world war, and decided to set up a refinery at Lloydminster. Steel was scarce, so Husky dismantled a small Wyoming refinery constructed during the war to provide bunker fuel to the American Navy. It loaded the pieces onto 40 gondola cars and shipped them north by railway.|$|E

However, since then, Masʻūd had allied himself with the powerful governor of Azerbaijan and Jibal, who in 1185 began moving his troops across the Zagros Mountains, causing Saladin to hesitate in his attacks. The defenders of Mosul, when they became aware that help was on the way, increased their efforts, and Saladin subsequently fell ill, so in March 1186 a peace treaty was signed.|$|E
25|$|Following Marriott's {{successful}} acting {{debut in}} Oliver!, his family {{encouraged him to}} pursue an acting career. In 1961 he auditioned and was accepted {{as a student at}} the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts in London. Because his family were unable to afford the private school fees, it was mutually agreed the fees would be deducted from acting work the school found him. After Marriott's enrolment at the Italia Conti Academy, he quickly gained acting roles, working consistently in film, television and radio, often typecast as the energetic Cockney kid. Soon he lost interest in acting and turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> to his first love, which was music. His parents were devastated and his decision to give up acting caused a family rift. As a result, he left the family home for a short period to stay with friends.|$|E
25|$|The {{ultimately}} failed crusading efforts did {{not preclude}} Thomas from seeking expansion. The {{death of the}} heirless Ulrich of Celje reopened the possibility of seizeing Talovac lands, but his father-in-law moved more quickly, leading to a new brief cooling in their relations. In January 1458, however, a new opportunity rose on Bosnia's eastern border. The turmoil that followed the death of Lazar Branković enabled Thomas to retake the formerly Bosnian part of {{the valley of the}} Drina, conquered by Lazar's father in the preceding decade, as well as to expand into the river's right bank. Thomas captured a total of 11 towns, keeping Srebrenica, Zvornik and Teočak for himself and distributing the rest among the local nobility that swore fealty to him. He then turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> to Croatia. He suggested to Venice that, since the Hungarians had not yet appointed a new ban of Croatia, he and the Republic should split the banate among themselves. In June, he warned Venice that the new Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus, Hunyadi's son, would not be a good neighbour to either Bosnia or Venice if he took hold of Croatia.|$|E
50|$|Palm Springs {{had been}} {{awaiting}} Haber's {{return to the}} club scene and in January 1994, he obliged them {{with the opening of}} Touche, a $1.3 million Moroccan-themed bar, nightclub and restaurant. More than 500 people showed up on opening night, including Andy Williams, George Hamilton, Connie Stevens, Jack Jones, Engelbert Humperdinck, Marc Lawrence and Jackie Mason. Despite an international plug from Runaway with the Rich and Famous (featuring Robin Leach), a pattern emerged at Touche: Haber was turning people away on weekends, but had no mid-week business. He eventually discovered that people's work and play habits had changed, and that there was also more enlightenment about alcohol and substance abuse through the media. Haber sold Touche in 1996 for $250,000 and returned <b>his</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>back</b> to The Ingleside Inn and Melvyn's, which were still thriving.|$|R

25|$|Dahmer then brandished a {{knife and}} {{informed}} Edwards he intended to take nude pictures of him. In an attempt to appease Dahmer, Edwards unbuttoned his shirt, saying he {{would allow him to}} do so if he would remove the handcuffs and put the knife away. In response to this promise, Dahmer simply turned his attention towards the TV; Edwards observed Dahmer rocking back and forth and chanting before turning <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> to him: he placed his head on Edwards' chest, listened to his heartbeat and, with the knife pressed against his intended victim, informed Edwards he intended to eat his heart. In continuous attempts to prevent Dahmer from attacking him, Edwards repeated that he was Dahmer's friend and {{that he was not going}} to run away. (Edwards had decided he was going to either jump from a window or run through the unlocked front door upon the next available opportunity.) When Edwards next stated he needed to use the bathroom, he asked if they could sit with a beer in the living room, where there was air conditioning, to which Dahmer consented, and the pair walked to the living room when Edwards exited the bathroom. Inside the living room, Edwards waited until he observed Dahmer have a momentary lapse of concentration before requesting to use the bathroom again. When Edwards rose from the couch, he noted Dahmer was not holding the handcuffs, whereupon Edwards punched him in the face, knocking Dahmer off balance, and ran out the front door.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after graduating}} high school, Stebbins {{enrolled}} in the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He initially majored in civil engineering, thinking it a better career option than biology, but became unhappy with the program. Struggling with poor performance and health issues related to congenital heart problems, he took a leave for year and a half. During his time in recuperation, he turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> to natural history, and was persuaded to return to UCLA by Raymond Cowles, a biology professor there. Stebbins returned with enthusiasm despite the perceived lack of job security, remarking in 1985: [...] "I was cautious because of the Great Depression, but I was determined to pursue biology {{even if it meant}} standing on a corner with a tin cup." [...] He switched his major to zoology and graduated in 1940 with highest honors.|$|E

The Canucks {{were hoping to}} make a deal at the 2013 NHL Entry Draft. As the draft approached, it was reported the Canucks were also shopping Schneider. Originally, it was believed the rumors were an attempt by Gillis to gain leverage for any potential Luongo deals. However, in a surprise move, Schneider was trade to the New Jersey Devils for the ninth overall pick in the draft, which Vancouver used to select Bo Horvat. Fans, as well as both Luongo and Schneider, were shocked by the news. Luongo stated, [...] "I have to let this sink in and figure out what I'm going to do." [...] While Schneider stated he was not sure what to say or think and he was speechless, adding, [...] "it was nice to have resolution to the situation." ...|$|E
25|$|Nixon won {{a resounding}} {{victory in the}} {{important}} New Hampshire primary on March 12, with 78% of the vote. Anti-war Republicans wrote {{in the name of}} New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, the leader of the Republican Party's liberal wing, who received 11% of the vote and became Nixon's new challenger. Rockefeller had originally not intended to run, having discounted a campaign for the nomination in 1965 and planned on making Senator Jacob Javits the favorite son, either in preparation of a presidential campaign or to secure him the second spot on the ticket; as Rockefeller warmed to the idea of entering the race again however, Javits moved <b>his</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>back</b> towards seeking a third term in the Senate. Nixon led Rockefeller in the polls throughout the primary campaign, and though Rockefeller defeated Nixon and Governor John Volpe in the Massachusetts primary on April 30, he otherwise fared poorly in state primaries and conventions, having declared too late to place his name on state ballots.|$|R

25|$|By {{the end of}} July 1883, Gilbert and Sullivan were {{revising}} {{drafts of}} the libretto for Ida. Sullivan finished some of the composition by early September {{when he had to}} begin preparations for his conducting duties at the triennial Leeds Festival, held in October. In late October, Sullivan turned <b>his</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>back</b> to Ida, and rehearsals began in November. Gilbert was also producing his one-act drama, Comedy and Tragedy, and keeping an eye on a revival of his Pygmalion and Galatea at the Lyceum Theatre by Mary Anderson's company. In mid-December, Sullivan bade farewell to his sister-in-law Charlotte, the widow of his brother Fred, who departed with her young family to America, never to return. Sullivan's oldest nephew, Herbert, stayed behind in England as his uncle's ward, and Sullivan threw himself into the task of orchestrating the score of Princess Ida. As he had done with Iolanthe, Sullivan wrote the overture himself, rather than assigning it to an assistant as he did in the case of most of his operas.|$|R
500|$|At this stage, Hitler {{ordered the}} final {{destruction}} of Leningrad with no prisoners taken, and on 9 September, Army Group North began the final push. Within ten days it had advanced within [...] of the city. However, the push {{over the last}} [...] proved very slow and casualties mounted. Hitler, now out of patience, ordered that Leningrad should not be stormed, but rather starved into submission. Along these lines, the OKH issued Directive No. la 1601/41 on 22 September 1941, which accorded Hitler's plans. Deprived of its Panzer forces, Army Group Center remained static and was subjected to numerous Soviet counterattacks, in particular the Yelnya Offensive, in which the Germans suffered their first major tactical defeat since their invasion began; this Red Army victory also provided an important boost to Soviet morale. These attacks prompted Hitler to concentrate <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> to Army Group Center and its drive on Moscow. The Germans ordered the 3rd and 4th Panzer Armies to break off their Siege of Leningrad and support Army Group Center in its attack on Moscow.|$|E
500|$|In his {{introduction}} to the trial, Potts writes; [...] "Thus have we for a time left the Graund Witches of the Forrest of Pendle, to the good consideration of a very sufficient jury." [...] Bromley had by then heard the cases against the three Pendle witches who had confessed to their guilt, but {{he had yet to}} deal with the others, who maintained their innocence. He knew that the only testimony against them would come from a nine-year-old girl, and that King James had cautioned judges to examine carefully the evidence presented against accused witches, warning against credulity. In his conclusion to the account of the trial, Potts says that it was interposed in the expected sequence [...] "by special order and commandment", presumably of the trial judges. After having convicted and sentenced to death three witches, Bromley may have been keen to avoid any suspicion of credulity by presenting his [...] "masterful exposure" [...] of the evidence presented by Grace Sowerbutts, before turning <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> to the remainder of the Pendle witches.|$|E
500|$|Titled Return to the Planet of the Apes, {{the project}} was put on fast track and almost entered pre-production. Rick Baker was hired to design the {{prosthetic}} makeup with Danny Elfman composing the film score. Tom Cruise and Charlie Sheen were in contention for the lead role. [...] "I can't accurately describe in words the utter euphoria I felt knowing that I, Adam Rifkin, {{was going to be}} resurrecting the Planet of the Apes. It all seemed too good to be true. I soon found out it was." [...] Days before the film was to commence pre-production, new studio executives arrived at Fox, which caused creative differences between Rifkin and the studio. Rifkin was commissioned to rewrite the script through various drafts. The project was abandoned until Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh pitched their own idea, with the apes going through a Renaissance. In the story, the ape government becomes concerned over the new art works, the humans are revolting and the liberal apes shelter a half-human, half-ape from the gorillas. Roddy McDowall was enthusiastic about their proposal and agreed to play the Leonardo da Vinci-type character they had written for him. However, the executive Jackson spoke to was not a fan of the series and seemingly unaware of McDowall's involvement in the series, and Jackson turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> to Heavenly Creatures.|$|E
50|$|With {{this out}} of the way the king turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> to the north, {{breaking}} through the English-held Lowlands and heading for the Red Comyn's old stronghold in Lochaber. His march into the Highlands was supported by a fleet of galleys sailing up Loch Linnhe. John Bacach, acting for his elderly father, asked for a truce, unable to face the full force of this combined onslaught. Bruce then wheeled to the north-east to settle manners with his principal enemy, the Red Comyn's cousin and namesake, John Comyn, 3rd Earl of Buchan. This campaign lasted through the winter season, climaxing at the Battle of Inverurie in May 1308. Bruce was now at liberty to turn <b>his</b> full <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> to unfinished business in the west.|$|R

Seeing that {{he was unable to}} reclaim East Prussia, Fredrick turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> to the Austrians, invading the providence of Moravia. However, the Austrians refused to engage him in battle, and therefore he could not land any of the spectacular victories that had salvaged his strategic nightmare so far.

Unwilling to meet an elite force on foreign territory, Peter ordered his forces to retreat, but kept light forces in the area to harass the Swedes whenever possible.

His family disowned him, and over the next two years he realised what a mistake he had made, as the woman made his life a misery and left him. She reappeared two years later, dressed in rich clothes and fabulous jewels, and he asked if she was coming back to him. She left again and the man sank further into drunkenness, eventually saved by the discipline of the army during the First World War. The man eventually became a croupier at a casino and saw her, in a reduced state - as her jewels were paste replicas to his trained eye, and she was again on the edge of destitution. He passed another man's winnings to her. At this point in the story, the Countess jumps up and cries, [...] "Why?" [...] Vaucher smiles and replies that it was pity that made him do it.
