Background: Decrease of {{economically}} accessible uranium resources motivates {{consideration of}} breeding of fertile {{elements such as}} thorium. Material and Method: Thorium oxide fuel burn up calculation of a simulated research reactor cooled heavy water has been proposed in the present work using MCNPX 2. 6 code. Two U- 233 and U- 235 isotopes {{have been used as}} <b>fissile</b> <b>element</b> of thorium oxide fuel. Xe- 135 and Sm- 149 reactivity variations has been studied in the core loaded (Th-U- 233) O- 2 or (Th-U- 235) O- 2 fuel matrixes during 3 months burn up process. Results: Thorium oxide having 4 % U- 233 burned 1 MW power results in less Sm- 149 reactivity than thorium oxide having 4 % U- 235 burned in 0. 5 MW power. Xe- 135 reactivity has an overestimated shift by 15 days in the core operated in 0. 5 MW than the other, after 15 days both the cores behave similarly. 480 g of U- 235 burns into the core using 0. 5 MW power and 364 g of U- 233 invents after 3 months. Burn up calculation of the modeled core of (Th-U- 233) O- 2 fuel shows a fissile mass reduction by 60 days while the consumed fissile mass reaches to its initial value after 120 days. The core flux is constant during 3 months for both modeled cores. A considerable negative reactivity occurs up to 15 days in both cores which can be refer to xenon inventory during thistime and then neutron multiplication factor is steadier up 3 months.

New and highly sensitive mass spectrometric methods like Large-Geometry Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry can perform highly accurate and precise isotopic measurements even of the minor isotopes of uranium and plutonium on single particles with sizes in the micrometer range. Therefore there is a growing need for reference material which meets the specific requirements of particle analysis in nuclear safeguards and nuclear forensics. Ideally, particle reference material provides a certified amount of <b>fissile</b> <b>elements</b> as well as the certified isotopic composition of each individual particle.

The complete setup for particle generation is divided into three main stages: aerosol production (1), calcination into solid particles (2) and particle sample collection on an appropriate substrate (3).

Nuclear energy was specifically mentioned as a main weapon to combat the buildup of excessive greenhouse gases – whose existence was thus explicitly acknowledged – {{as well as to}} provide the energy that will be needed in the possible transition to what might eventually {{turn out to be a}} less energy intensive economy. As pointed out in my energy economics textbook (2000), in such a transition more energy might initially be required than ever for such things as the production of e. g. hydrogen: although thermodynamically a loser, hydrogen might deserve the status of an economic winner in a world where oil is scarce and motor fuel is valuable. Something else that might be needed is a better understanding of the simple economics pertaining to nuclear energy and its optimal use in electricity generation, since recent textbooks and other publications seem reluctant to take up this topic.

A two-step process is used for the isotope production. First, neutrons are generated in a liquid mercury target, irradiated by the 1 GeV proton or deuteron beam, provided by the EURISOL linac driver. Then, the neutrons induce fission in a surrounding assembly of uranium carbide. R&D projects on several aspects of the target assembly are ongoing. Key criteria for the target design are a maximum beam power capability of 4 MW, a remote handling system with minimum downtime and maximum reliability, as well as radiation safety, minimization of hazards and the classification of the facility. In the framework of the ongoing radiation characterization and safety studies, radiation transport simulations have been performed to calculate the prompt radiation dose in the target and surrounding materials, as well as to determine shielding material and angle-dependent parameters.

40|$|This {{project is}} a {{fundamental}} study to measure thermal properties (liquidus, solidus, phase transformation, and enthalpy) of molten salt systems of interest to electrorefining operations, which are used in both the fuel cycle research & development mission and the spent fuel treatment mission of the Department of Energy. During electrorefining operations the electrolyte accumulates elements more active than uranium (transuranics, fission products and bond sodium). The accumulation needs to be closely monitored because the thermal properties of the electrolyte will change as the concentration of the impurities increases. During electrorefining (processing techniques used at the Idaho National Laboratory to separate uranium from spent nuclear fuel) {{it is important for}} the electrolyte to remain in a homogeneous liquid phase for operational safeguard and criticality reasons. The phase stability of molten salts in an electrorefiner may be adversely affected by the buildup of fission products in the electrolyte. Potential situations that need to be avoided are: (i) build up of <b>fissile</b> <b>elements</b> in the salt approaching the criticality limits specified for the vessel (ii) freezing of the salts due to change in the liquidus temperature and (iii) phase separation (non-homogenous solution) of elements. The stability (and homogeneity) of the phases can potentially be monitored through the thermal characterization of the salts, which can be a function of impurity concentration. This work describes the experimental results of typical salts compositions, consisting of chlorides of strontium, samarium, praseodymium, lanthanum, barium, cerium, cesium, neodymium, sodium and gadolinium (as a surrogate for both uranium and plutonium), used in the processing of used nuclear fuels. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to analyze numerous salt samples providing results on the thermal properties. The property of most interest to pyroprocessing is the liquidus temperature. It was previously known the liquidus temperature of the molten salt would change as spent fuel is processed through the Mk-IV electrorefiner. However, the extent of the increase in liquidus temperature was not known. This work is first of its kind in determining thermodynamic properties of a molten salt electrolyte containing transuranics, fission products and bond sodium. Experimental data concluded that the melting temperature of the electrolyte will become greater than the operating temperature of the Mk-IV ER during current fuel processing campaigns.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this calculation is to provide estimates {{of the amount of}} fissile material flowing out of the waste package (source term) and the accumulation of <b>fissile</b> <b>elements</b> (U and Pu) in a crushed-tuff invert. These calculations provide input for the analysis of repository impacts of the Pu-ceramic waste forms. In particular, the source term results are used as input to the far-field accumulation calculation reported in Ref. 51, and the in-drift accumulation results are used as inputs for the criticality calculations reported in Ref. 2. The results are also summarized and interpreted in Ref. 52. The scope of this calculation is the waste package (WP) Viability Assessment (VA) design, which consists of an outer corrosion-allowance material (CAM) and an inner corrosion-resistant material (CRM). This design is used in this calculation in order to be consistent with earlier Pu-ceramic degradation calculations (Ref. 15). The impact of the new Enhanced Design Alternative-I 1 (EDA- 11) design on the results will be addressed in a subsequent report. The design of the invert (a leveling foundation, which creates a level surface of the drift floor and supports the WP mounting structure) is consistent with the EDA-I 1 design. The invert will be composed of crushed stone and a steel support structure (Ref. 17). The scope of this calculation is also defined by the nominal degradation scenario, which involves the breach of the WP (Section 10. 5. 1. 2, Ref. 48), followed by the influx of water. Water in the WP may, in time, gradually leach the fissile components and neutron absorbers out of the ceramic waste forms. Thus, the water in the WP may become laden with dissolved actinides (e. g., Pu and U), and may eventually overflow or leak from the WP. Once the water leaves the WP, it may encounter the invert, in which the actinides may reprecipitate. Several factors could induce reprecipitation; these factors include: the high surface area of the crushed stone, and the presence of reactive components in the stone (such as calcium and silica); the contrasting chemistry of water trapped in the pores of the invert; and the possible presence of reducing materials in the support structure. This calculation estimates the amounts of Pu and U that may accumulate in the invert as a consequence of chemical precipitation. The degradation scenario is consistent with the overall degradation analysis methodology outlined in Section 3. 1 of the Disposal Criticality Analysis Methodology Topical Report (Ref. 47). Specifically, the scenario NF- 1 b of Figure 3 - 2 a of that document prescribes the processes analyzed in this calculation.
