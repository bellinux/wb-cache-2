50|$|The nesting {{season is}} April to June and the clutch varies {{from one to}} five very {{symmetrical}} white eggs. Indian <b>grey</b> <b>hornbills</b> usually nest in tree hollows on tall trees. An existing hollow may be excavated further to suit. The female enters the nest hollow and seals the nest hole, leaving only a small vertical slit through which the male feeds her. The nest entrance is sealed by the female using its excreta and mud-pellets supplied by the male. While inside the nest, the female moults her flight feathers and incubates the eggs. The regrowth of the female's feathers coincides with the maturity of the chicks, {{at which point the}} nest is broken open.|$|R

50|$|After a {{few years}} of living in the pyramid, Judy had toucans, African <b>grey</b> <b>hornbills,</b> finches, macaws, chickens, geese, turkeys, ducks, pheasants, peacocks, a black swan, skunks, emus, dogs and horses. At peak there were two horses (Twiggy and KoKo), five emus and five aviaries. She told Ocean Breeze News in 2012:“Every time I came home from Naples I brought {{something}} home with me that was alive!”During the 'golden years' of the 1980s, Monte, Judy, her pets, and their daughter, Heather all lived in the pyramid house. Heather took a boat to and from school, as did Monte and Judy when they left the island. They used a small pass located behind the house. However, after {{a few years}}, the pass had become too shallow due to erosion, so Monte purchased a small ATV to drive to {{the west side of the}} island where the family now docked their boats. July described the erosion process:“On the pass side it never eroded. The reason why the pass disappeared is because all the sand from the Gulf went into the pass. When that erosion started, it just didn’t stop.”The island's shoreline began to rapidly erode in 1986. By 1987, the Innes' two horses had to be removed from the island, as the eroding shoreline had made it unsafe for them to remain. Judy explained:“It was time for them to go. Marco Dock and Piling came out. We lifted them on a trailer with a crane and onto the barge.”In 1988, Judy had a horse-related injury, a broken shoulder. She was unable to stay on the island, and regained her strength at her Naples residence. That same year, Monte went missing and has not been seen since. During that time, Heather would visit the island to care for the animals, and she began the process of removing them in 1988. Most of them were taken to the Judy Innes' mother's Naples home. Also in 1988, the house was threatened by the approaching coastline, which just three years prior had been 2,000 feet out.|$|R
50|$|The final {{programme}} looks at India's dwindling rainforests, now {{confined to the}} Western Ghats, upper Assam and Sri Lanka. The once extensive forests have been decimated by logging, firewood collection and hunting. In the opening scene, Valmik Thapar tracks lion-tailed macaques in southern India, a very rare fruit and seed eating monkey. In the Western Ghats, there are 120 species of amphibian, including flying frogs. Invertebrates use colour for camouflage, warning and defence, but mantises and crickets still fall prey to slow-moving chameleons. A faster reptile, the flying lizard, is shown gliding from tree to tree. Also filmed is the ancient practice of collecting honey from wild bees' nests high in the canopy. Birds visiting a fruiting fig tree include great Indian <b>hornbills,</b> Malabar <b>grey</b> <b>hornbills,</b> blossom-headed parakeets and fairy bluebirds. Mammals are also attracted by the fruit: Nilgiri langurs, bonnet macaques and Malabar giant squirrels. On the forest floor, wild boar and barking deer feed on the rejected figs, drawing a prowling leopard. Monkeys spot the danger and raise the alarm. The many varieties of fig tree provide food year-round for all these animals. Each fig is pollinated by a particular species of wasp, which lay their eggs in the fruits. Thapar visits the world's largest fig, a sacred banyan tree that draw pilgrims from far and wide. In the hill forests of southern India, Thapar tracks Nilgiri tahr on the grassy peaks. Here, the rains last for 6 months, creating huge waterfalls. The Sinharaja forest of Sri Lanka has more unique species than anywhere else on the subcontinent, including dozens of kinds of jumping spiders, each with their own courtship signals. A tiger is filmed stalking a rutting gaur herd. Gaur are the world's biggest cattle {{but they have been}} known to fall prey to tigers. The program ends on a sober note, filming elephants crossing tea plantations where forests once stood. The problem elephants are caught and trained as working animals. A wild calf is shown being caught by lasso. The distressed animal is broken by torture, but it is also worshipped: one of the paradoxes of the subcontinent.|$|R
50|$|The Malabar <b>grey</b> <b>hornbill</b> is {{a common}} {{resident}} breeder in the Western Ghats and associated hills of southern India.
