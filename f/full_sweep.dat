25|$|The {{relatively}} isolated but {{easily accessible}} {{summit of the}} Tour Ronde {{has a reputation for}} providing mountaineers with one of the finest viewpoints within the Mont Blanc range, and offers an ideal place for observing the sun rising on Mont Blanc itself. To the north it offers extensive views over the wide and heavily crevassed Glacier du Géant and the Vallée Blanche towards the Aiguille du Midi, whilst looking westwards it provides very extensive views towards Mont Maudit and the <b>full</b> <b>sweep</b> of the Brenva Face of Mont Blanc and the Peuterey Ridge.|$|E
25|$|The top of Sail is a heathery dome {{bearing a}} small cairn. The main path {{along the ridge}} passes by to the south to take its heavily eroded course up Crag Hill. The view, other than where blocked by this lower neighbour, is excellent. The head of Coledale is laid out to the north while eastward is the <b>full</b> <b>sweep</b> of the Helvellyn range above Catbells. The High fells around Ennerdale, Wasdale {{and the head of}} Eskdale {{complete}} the panorama southward. Bassenthwaite Lake {{can be seen from the}} summit and a few steps will bring Buttermere and Derwentwater into view.|$|E
25|$|Some {{same-sex}} marriage opponents initially doubted {{that there was}} enough support for legislatures to pass laws for {{same-sex marriage}}; doubters also saw how same-sex marriage previously only advanced through the judiciary. But within seven months into the campaign, same-sex marriage laws were passed in four more states, although Maine's law was repealed by a people's veto on November 3, 2009 funded heavily by organizations from outside the state. However, in the 2012 election, same-sex marriage in Maine was approved by popular vote, meaning {{five of the six}} states had legalized same-sex marriage.

25|$|The F-111 was an {{all-weather}} attack aircraft, {{capable of}} low-level penetration of enemy defenses to deliver ordnance on the target. The F-111 featured variable-geometry wings, an internal weapons bay and a cockpit with side-by-side seating. The cockpit {{was part of}} an escape crew capsule. The wing sweep varied between 16 degrees and 72.5 degrees (full forward to <b>full</b> <b>sweep).</b> The wing included leading edge slats and double slotted flaps over its full length. The airframe was made up mostly of aluminium alloys with steel, titanium and other materials used in places. The fuselage was made of a semi-monocoque structure with stiffened panels and honeycomb structure panels for skin.|$|E
25|$|The F-111B was an {{all-weather}} {{interceptor aircraft}} intended to defend U.S. Navy carrier battle groups against bombers and anti-ship missiles. The F-111 features variable geometry wings, an internal weapons bay and a cockpit with {{side by side}} seating. The cockpit {{is part of an}} escape crew capsule. The wing sweep varies between 16 degrees and 72.5 degrees (full forward to <b>full</b> <b>sweep).</b> The airframe consisted mostly of aluminum alloys with steel, titanium and other materials also used. The fuselage is a semi-monocoque structure with stiffened panels and honeycomb sandwich panels for skin. The F-111B was powered by two Pratt & Whitney TF30 afterburning turbofan engines and included the AN/AWG-9 radar system for controlling the AIM-54 Phoenix air-to-air missiles. Poor visibility over the nose made the aircraft more difficult to handle for carrier operations.|$|E
500|$|The B-1 has a blended wing body configuration, with variable-sweep wing, four {{turbofan}} engines, triangular fin {{control surfaces}} and cruciform tail. The wings can sweep from 15 degrees to 67.5 degrees (full forward to <b>full</b> <b>sweep).</b> Forward-swept wing settings {{are used for}} takeoff, landings and high-altitude maximum cruise. Aft-swept wing settings are used in high subsonic and supersonic flight. The B-1's variable-sweep wings and thrust-to-weight ratio provide it with improved takeoff performance, allowing it to use shorter runways than previous bombers. [...] The length of the aircraft presented a flexing problem due to air turbulence at low altitude. To alleviate this, Rockwell included small triangular fin control surfaces or vanes near the nose on the B-1. The B-1's Structural Mode Control System rotates the vanes automatically to counteract turbulence and smooth out the ride.|$|E

2500|$|The {{development}} of these idioms, {{as well as more}} conservative reactions against them, can be traced through the works of poets such as Edwin Arlington Robinson (1869–1935), Stephen Crane (1871–1900), Robert Frost (1874–1963) and Carl Sandburg (1878–1967). Frost, in particular, is a commanding figure, who aligned strict poetic meter, particularly blank verse and terser lyrical forms, with a [...] "vurry Amur'k'n" [...] (as Pound put it) idiom. He successfully revitalized a rural tradition with many English antecedents from his beloved Golden Treasury and produced an oeuvre of major importance, rivaling or even excelling in achievement that of the key modernists and making him, within the <b>full</b> <b>sweep</b> of more traditional modern English-language verse, a peer of Hardy and Yeats. But from Whitman and Dickinson the outlines of a distinctively new organic poetic tradition, less indebted to English formalism than Frost's work, were clear to see, and they would come to full fruition in the 1910s and '20s.|$|E
2500|$|In 1971 he was {{secretary}} of the Cambridge University Cricket Club, and scored 747 runs at 49.80, [...] "hitting the ball with the <b>full</b> <b>sweep</b> of the bat". In the second match of the season he made 108 not out against Leicestershire, adding 175 for the third wicket with his captain, Majid Khan, to take Cambridge to a seven-wicket victory. In the match against Oxford University he scored 146 in just under four hours to enable Khan to declare; the match ended in a draw with Oxford nine wickets down. In 1972, once again secretary to Khan, he made 373 runs at 41.44, and in his last match, against Oxford, he scored 114 in a match when nobody else passed 51, and helped Cambridge to an innings victory, their first victory in the series since 1958 after 11 of the previous 12 matches had been drawn. In 10 matches for Surrey later that season he scored two centuries, and he finished the first-class season with 962 runs at 35.62. He was named the Cricket Writers' Club Young Cricketer of the Year for 1972.|$|E

60|$|Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be {{eventually}} perceived, {{that behind}} those forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself; incidentally {{making use of}} them for other and more private ends than they were legitimately intended to subserve. That certain sultanism of his brain, which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested; through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship.
