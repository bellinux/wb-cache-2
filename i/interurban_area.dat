50|$|The Shaker {{rapid transit}} {{remained}} the only service using the interurban {{portion of the}} CUT for 25 years. When the Cleveland Transit System built its rapid transit (later designated the Red Line) in 1955 (using much of the right-of-way previously developed by the Van Sweringens), another rapid transit station {{was built in the}} former <b>interurban</b> <b>area</b> of the CUT to serve it. Since the CTS Rapid Transit (Red Line) and the Shaker rapid transit (Green and Blue Lines) were owned by different entities at the time, there was no fare transfer between the trains, and the stations were entirely separate. Amtrak left CUT in 1973, using a smaller train station built directly upon the intercity line along the lakefront.|$|E
40|$|Productive {{restructuring}} and population dynamics WHEN THE STATE of São Paulo {{began to lose}} relative share of the country’s industrial production {{at the beginning of}} the 1970 s, various writers began to debate the nature, intensitiy and perspectives of decentralized economic and interurban activity. For Azzoni (1986), there would be a decentralized <b>interurban</b> <b>area</b> within a limited range, an agglomerative field with a radius of approximately 150 kilometers, which would yield an outline the size of the city of São Paulo and its metropolitan region. Diniz (1993) showed a series of factors that contributed to geographical decentralization of production, favoring “polygonal development, ” whose vertices encompass an area much larger than the State of São Paulo. This polygon could be defined by connecting the cities of Belo Horizonte, Uberlandia, Londrina, Florianópolis, Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte. Among other decentralizing factors, the important points would be: the lack of a formal economy in the metropolitan area of São Paulo, combined with the surging of informal, agglomerating economies in other urban centers an...|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we test he urban asset pricing model of Capozza nd Sick (1988) {{and focus on the}} {{empirical}} dimen-sions of the effects of risk on urban land prices. The effects of systematic and unsystematic risk are distinguished in the model which incorporates the value of the option to convert land to urban uses into the pricing of urban real estate. We find the value of systematic r sk in our Canadian urban areas to he negative and highly statistically significant. We find that approximately 2. 5 percent of the value of houses in our sample arises from systematic risk. In our sample, unsystematic r sk is a larger proportion of total risk than systematic risk. Therefore, most of the effect of total risk may be ascribed to unsystematic risk. The effect of total risk on land prices is illustrated through the irreversibility premia estimates. These premia vary greatly in size and statistical significance. Thus, the effect of unsystematic risk is highly city specific. In the two regions where the irreversibility premia re statistically significant, it accounts for 22 percent and 53 percent of the average housing price; thus, unsystematic risk can be a very important determinant ofhousing prices. These results highlight he importance of risk in determining urban land prices. The value of the option to convert land to urban uses imparts considerable value to developed land and must be considered when evaluating <b>interurban</b> <b>area</b> price differences...|$|E
40|$|Heterogeneous {{photocatalysis}} is {{a rapidly}} developing field in environmental engineering. It {{has a great}} potential {{to cope with the}} increasing pollution by traffic. The addition of a photocatalyst to ordinary building materials such as concrete, creates environmental friendly materials by which air pollution or pollution of the surface itself can be diminished. TiO 2 is added to a cement mortar in order to diminish the air polluting effect by exhaust gasses. In particular, the conversion of NOx to NO 3 - is measured. A detailed study of the principles of photocatalysis and of the interaction between TiO 2 and concrete is carried out. The laboratory study pointed at the influence of different parameters, such as temperature, relative humidity, light intensity, applied surface, material characteristics and flow rate. An upscaling of the test set-up has been carried out to see the influence of an increase in photocatalytic active surface. In a more global approach, the application of TiO 2 as air purifying material is studied to be implemented in the urban and interurban streets and roads. In the European project NR 2 C, photocatalytic materials and different application methods are studied. This paper presents an overview of the principle of photocatalysis and the application in combination with cement, as well as the results of the laboratory research, especially towards air purifying action. The implementation of this type of material in an urban and <b>interurban</b> <b>area</b> is discussed. A large scale realization with concrete pavement blocks is accomplished on the main roads (Leien) in the centre of Antwerp. An overview of this realization is given...|$|E

40|$|The “Cut and Cover ” and “Cover and Cut ” {{methods are}} {{advanced}} engineering techniques for tunnel construction in urban and <b>interurban</b> <b>areas.</b> Initially meant for subway tunneling, the “Cut and Cover ” method has been lately adopted in motorway projects {{to deal with}} small-depth road tunnels and local environmental constraints. The main concept of the method consists of full-length or sequential excavation along the road segment and subsequent construction of the tunnel bore. Following drainage and waterproofing measures, backfilling requires a well-monitored construction process, adequately {{defined in terms of}} equipment and quality control. Environmental issues, such as planting and seeding, constitute the final stage, complemented, eventually, by reconstruction of the secondary road network upslope. The “Cover and Cut ” method for tunnel construction was originally developed for urban subway structures where the least possible disruption of traffic is required. In motorway construction projects, road designers prescribe the method for underground structures to efficiently face major issues of instability. At a first stage, a shallow excavation and grading is performed, followed by the construction of a sub-soil concrete “vault”. This vault acting as a retainin...|$|R

40|$|AbstractUntil recently, {{the design}} of road {{infrastructure}} involved mainly concerns related to the base speed value and {{to high levels of}} service. However, it is today consensually accepted that only an integrated approach is able {{to take into account the}} interests and needs of all the involved users. This vision led to different approaches on speed management along the road. During the last decade, new speed limits setting methodological approaches have emerged, based on new design models and tools, which take into account road geometric, safety and operational characteristics. This research work aimed to develop a decision-support methodology for the definition of the appropriate maximum speed in each road section, with a widespread use, applied to single carriageway roads in <b>interurban</b> <b>areas,</b> crossing different road environments with a mixed use. An analytical model able to accurately estimate that speed limit was developed based on a set of objective and easily measurable and obtainable explanatory variables characterizing the section under analysis and its surrounding areas. The resulting methodology is a Multinomial Logit model, and it was carried out using a case-study involving four different tracks of interurban roads crossing different environments. The model was estimated resorting to the use of values chosen by four traffic safety experts recorded for each road segment in both directions...|$|R

40|$|The develoopment of squat defects {{has become}} a major concern in {{numerous}} railway systems throughout the world. The paper details findings from vehhicle dynamic simulation and contact patch calculations for an example case of a curve transition. The example case is drawn from operations on the Sydney metropolitan and <b>interurban</b> <b>areas</b> and the simulation results are cross compared to observations of squat formation in RailCorp track. Observed squats occur in curve transition of tight curves and in medium radius curves on the high rail. Squats locations and numbers of squats are more numerous with locations on uphill grades or exiting stations, locations where traction effort is applied. The curve locations in RailCorp produce cracks initiating as head checks in the gauge corner of the rail with a squat crack being produced {{from the middle of the}} rail head growing both laterally to the field side of the rail and longitudinal in both directions. The vehhicle dynamics simulations show that risk of RCF formation based on the creep energy T is greatly dependent on tractive effort in curving. There are distinctly different contact force conditions generated by the leading and trailing wheelsets of the bogie. The squat crack growth occurs largely under the contact patch of the trailing wheel whilst head checks occur with the leading wheelset contact patch...|$|R

2500|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{streetcar}} systems led to the widespread ability of people to live outside of a city and commute into it for work on a daily basis. [...] Several of the communities that grew {{as a result of}} this new mobility were known as streetcar suburbs. [...] Another outgrowth of the popularity of urban streetcar systems was the rise of interurban lines, which were basically streetcars that operated between cities and served remote, even rural, areas. [...] In some <b>areas</b> <b>interurban</b> lines competed with regular passenger service on mainline railroads and in others they simply complemented the mainline roads by serving towns not on the mainlines.|$|R

[...] The South Shore Line, which runs from Chicago's Millennium Station to South Bend, Indiana, has been converted to modern electric rapid-transit operation on the dense corridor between Chicago and Gary, Indiana but still runs essentially as an interurban through several small towns between Gary and South Bend.

50|$|Not just turnpikes {{passed through}} Blandford, so did {{trolleys}} - though briefly. In 1912 electrified street railways (trolley car lines) covered Massachusetts, connecting towns and densely blanketing urban areas like Boston as {{in virtually all}} major American cities. They offered inexpensive, frequent and fast transportation, with some lines that connected urban <b>areas</b> (<b>interurbans)</b> regularly exceeding 50 mph. Thousands and {{thousands of miles of}} these lines were built at huge expense over a few decades across the United States but would soon be made obsolete by inexpensive autos, namely the Ford Model T. By the late 1940s few of these lines remained. Tiny remnants of this once huge network still exist as the street-level portions of the T, Boston's subway system.|$|R
40|$|The {{accident}} {{number has}} decreased considerably since 2003 {{in most of}} the countries. So, it becomes difficult from only accidents data to obtain ‘black spot’. Consequently, it can be interesting to work on incidents instead of accidents in order to prevent them. In order to acquire incidents, about 50 EDR (Event data recorded) have been implemented in different public fleets of company vehicles. After 6 months of acquisition, approximatively 700 events have been recorded. This paper illustrates the different types of events:’simple’ events in urban, <b>interurban</b> and highway <b>area,</b> lateral and longitudinal ‘incidents’ and finally accidents. It is highlighted in particular that the event acquisition can be used to improve road infrastructure or to improve knowledge in the accident/incident mechanisms analysis.
