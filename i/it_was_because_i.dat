[...] When she made it clear through his envoy Rzewuski that she would not marry him, there were hopes of an Austrian archduchess.|$|E
500|$|Fields edited Steven Spielberg's {{first major}} film, The Sugarland Express (1974). She became widely celebrated {{for her work}} as the film editor on Spielberg's next film, Jaws (1975), for which she won both the Academy Award for Film Editing and the American Cinema Editors Eddie Award in 1976. Leonard Maltin has {{characterized}} her editing as [...] "sensational". Gerald Peary, who interviewed Fields in 1980, wrote that, [...] "Jaws scared the world, brought in a fortune for Universal, and made Verna Fields, who won an Academy Award, about as famous 'overnight' as an editor ever gets." [...] He then quoted Fields as saying that, [...] "Steven told me <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> had cut the first picture that was a monumental success {{in which you can}} really see the editing. And people discovered that it was a woman who edited Jaws." ...|$|E
500|$|Kunis {{comes from}} a Jewish family and has cited {{antisemitism}} in the former Soviet Union as one of several reasons for her family's move to the United States. She has stated that her parents [...] "raised [...] Jewish {{as much as they}} could," [...] although religion was suppressed in the Soviet Union. On her second day in Los Angeles, Kunis was enrolled at Rosewood Elementary School, not knowing a word of English. She later recalled: [...] "I blocked out second grade completely. I have no recollection of it. I always talk to my mom and my grandma about it. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> cried every day. I didn't understand the culture. I didn't understand the people. I didn't understand the language. My first sentence of my essay to get into college was like, 'Imagine being blind and deaf at age seven.' And that's kind of what it felt like moving to the States." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know how}} I came to do it," [...] she declared. [...] "It just rushed {{out of its}} own accord. <b>I</b> suppose <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> know I can trust you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I feel sometimes," [...] she continued, [...] "as though I {{could not}} trust you. There, don't be angry," [...] she went on, laying {{her fingers on}} his arm. [...] "I know how horrid it sounds, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> there in my heart, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> would like to believe, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> want there to be nothing between us of distrust, that I have told you." ...|$|R

500|$|Returning home, the Chili Peppers parted ways and, for {{the most}} part, {{remained}} secluded from {{each other through the}} rest of 1997. No new material was written during that time, and {{it was not until the}} beginning of 1998 that the band began rehearsal. At that point, Navarro had become dependent on drugs, with Kiedis also struggling to remain clean. The band decided they would have a talk with Navarro and attempt to convince him to enter rehab. The discussion escalated into a heated dispute, and Navarro fell over an amplifier in a drug-induced daze. In April 2010, Navarro discussed this incident, stating that: [...] "One [...] was [...] my drug use at the time. The other was musical differences. Anthony says <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> tripped and fell over an amp while on drugs. I say that he was on more drugs than me at that point. We both had a loose relationship with reality. Who do you want to believe?" ...|$|E
500|$|Speer {{made himself}} widely {{available}} to historians and other enquirers. He did an extensive, in-depth interview for the June 1971 issue of Playboy magazine, {{in which he}} stated, [...] "If I didn't see it, then <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> didn't want to see it." [...] In October 1973, Speer made {{his first trip to}} Britain, flying to London under an assumed name to be interviewed by Ludovic Kennedy on the BBC Midweek programme. Upon arrival, he was detained for almost eight hours at Heathrow Airport when British immigration authorities discovered his true identity. The Home Secretary, Robert Carr, allowed Speer into the country for 48 hours. In the same year he appeared in the television programme The World at War. While in London eight years later to participate in the BBC Newsnight program, Speer suffered a stroke and died on September1, 1981. Speer had formed a relationship with an Englishwoman of German origin, and was with her {{at the time of his}} death.|$|E
500|$|On September 22, 2011, an 18-year-old Melanie Amaro {{performed}} [...] "Listen" [...] on {{the second}} day of the opening week of first season of The X Factor in the US. As commented by both Becky Bain of Idolator and Jennifer Still of the British entertainment and media news website Digital Spy, the [...] "powerful [...] emotional" [...] performance [...] "deservedly brought the judges to their feet". Amaro received a standing ovation from the audience and panel of judges alike. The performance of Amaro also brought Nicole Scherzinger to tears. She said: [...] "This is why I do this. People like you inspire me. You made a believer out of me. Thank you." [...] Paula Abdul said: [...] "You are the brightest gift, God bless you." [...] L.A. Reid declared: [...] "Melanie, you are truly amazing. You have the gift, you have the soul, you have the spirit, you have the swagger ... you have the X Factor" [...] while Simon Cowell said: [...] "When I was asked by a lot of people why I was bringing this show to America, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> hoped that we were going to find someone like you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she replied, [...] "you are not dull. Your {{feelings}} {{towards me}} are obvious and very natural. Mine towards you I {{am not so}} sure of. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> not <b>because</b> <b>I</b> did not understand you that I came here to-night. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> did not understand myself. May I go on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You have a {{right to}} know. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> disgraced; <b>because</b> as long as this disgrace hangs over me I can never marry.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Enough, Cousin Dickon,” {{interrupted}} the lady; “I do wish the bird, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> so wish that I commissioned this Mr. Leather- Stocking.” ...|$|R
2500|$|At {{the time}} there were few Jews in the NYPD, and as of 1950 there were none above the rank of captain. Seedman {{recalled}} later in his life {{that there was some}} attendant bias. [...] "I didn't get the choice assignments", he said. [...] "I think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was Jewish." [...] But he persevered, rising through the ranks nevertheless and became a detective. He also earned graduate degrees in public administration during this time.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 30, Akram was {{diagnosed}} with diabetes. [...] "I remember what a shock <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was a healthy sportsman with no history of diabetes in my family, so I didn't expect it at all. It seemed strange that {{it happened to me}} when I was 30, but it was a very stressful time and doctors said that can trigger it." [...] Since then he has actively sought to be involved in various awareness campaigns for diabetes.|$|E
2500|$|At {{this time}} McAvennie's {{success on the}} pitch came to the {{attention}} of TV producers. He appeared on the BBC's Wogan show, hosted by Terry Wogan, an event which McAvennie claims changed his life and introduced him to a celebrity lifestyle. He is quoted as saying [...] "Then I signed for West Ham and money and girls were thrown at me and, hey, who was I to say no? Then I went on Wogan and it really took off. I was never under any illusions why it was happening. It wisnae because of my looks, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was a footballer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} you perfectly," [...] she answered. [...] "I can also, I think, explain <b>it.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> never cared a rap about you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Peace, woman, peace," [...] said Caleb, {{shrinking}} {{back before}} her. [...] "Spare your reproaches; if I have sinned much <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have loved more----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On the contrary, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have so {{many here}} {{depending}} on me, of whom I am bound to think more than myself," [...] said John.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{certainly}} took {{upon himself}} to be interested, as I had hoped he would. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> had taken upon my self--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Leland laughed softly. [...] "Well, {{perhaps that}} was the reason, though I would sooner believe <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{recognised}} what I owed the State." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Dowey giggles. There {{is little}} doubt that in her youth she was an {{accomplished}} flirt. 'Maybe, mister, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> liked you best.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady Grace," [...] he declared, [...] "you spoil me. Perhaps <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> going away. Every one is kind to {{the people}} who go away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am always}} busy," [...] she answered. [...] "Perhaps <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> so lazy. I never do anything, {{so there is}} always so much to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Boy," [...] he said, [...] "you are young, and in hell itself there {{cannot be}} many such as she. You think me brutal. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> remember--your mother!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did I, Sister--I mean Wife? If so, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was {{not sure}} whether Ana, who is to be my chariot companion, would be back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{was going}} away that--that he spoke," [...] she said. [...] "Oh, Mrs. Holt, I {{knew that you}} would be kind about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{poor little}} feet didn't make much noise then! I daresay poor old Mr. Swales {{would have told}} me that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> didn't want to wake up Geordie." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have {{mastered}} them that I am what I am. I owe everything to them, consequently {{in my view}} they are the finest of all principles." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not a lady's man," [...] he said carelessly, [...] "but I {{must admit}} that all girls' voices sound pretty much alike to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{have spoken}} strongly, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> feel strongly," [...] {{he said in}} a strange, {{thickened}} voice. [...] "Hodder, {{how would you like to}} live in this house--alone?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was a very}} coward, I own; but it was for my mother's sake. If I feared death, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> bethought me of what it {{must mean}} to her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who {{told you}} that?" [...] Sam said. [...] "If I staid, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> knowed it wouldn't be long until I got {{the upper hand}} of the gang, an I've done it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "I {{was staying}} there. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> liked the place so much, and because I {{was so much}} happier here than in London, that I came back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> suppose <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{try to have}} influence," [...] rejoined Pedro, [...] "that I {{manage to}} have plenty of friends and foes,--the last being {{sometimes}} unreasonably bitter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, but I think <b>I</b> know. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> Leslie Gray's daughter, isn't it? I {{know that}} father loved you--his brother, Uncle Willis, {{told me all}} about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed. If I thought so, I {{should not}} be {{here to tell you}} what <b>I</b> thought. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> believe that you are injured that I am here." ...|$|R
