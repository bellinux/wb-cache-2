40|$|In {{order to}} achieve high heat removal rates for micro scale cooling, it may be {{necessary}} to exploit boiling heat transfer. The size of corresponding heat sinks is continuously decreasing from mini size to micro size, and one of the most practical and extensive cooling methods is boiling heat transfer in plain microchannels and microtubes, which might be limited by inherent boiling instabilities. This study provides useful information about boiling instability phenomena in microtubes and offers a parametric comparative investigation. Experimental data are obtained from microtubes having 254 ∼μm and 685 ∼ μm inner diameters, which were tested at low mass fluxes (78. 9 - 276. 3 kg/m 2 s) to reveal potential boiling instability mechanisms. De-ionized water was used as working fluid, while microtubes were heated by Joule heating. Configurations prone to boiling instabilities (low system pressures, low mass fluxes) were imposed to observe boiling instabilities in microtubes. Fine restriction valves were introduced to the system for providing flow restriction at the inlet. Alongside the experiments without any <b>inlet</b> <b>restriction,</b> experiments were conducted with configurations having inlet restrictions, where pressure drops over <b>inlet</b> <b>restriction</b> elements were 4 and 8 times as much as pressure drop over the microtube to suppress boiling instabilities. Temperature and pressure drop fluctuation signals were recorded and processed before premature CHF (Critical Heat Flux) conditions and at impending premature CHF conditions. Furthermore, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the recorded data is performed for revealing the frequency correlations of the obtained fluctuations for observing the change in the FFT behavior. A significant rise in energy of the side lobes, which are basically the high frequency spectral regions, was observed from FFT profiles for impending premature CHF conditions implying that FFT could be used as a detection tool for premature CHF...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to their}} heat {{transfer}} efficiency and compact implementation methods, {{the use of}} flow boiling via plain and modified microchannels for cooling solutions gained a significant importance in the last decade. The increasing need for more efficient cooling solutions in various fields of micro scale cooling such as aerospace, microreactors, automotive industry, micropropulsion, fuel cells, drug delivery systems, biological and chemical applications is motivating researchers to investigate the physics behind the micro scale flow boiling phenomena. The proposed study aims {{to make a contribution}} to the literature in the related field by filling the gap of scientific knowledge about the microchannel flow boiling heat transfer capabilities at ultra high mass fluxes, under unstable boiling conditions and with microchannels having inner wall surface enhancements via nanostructure coating. The present thesis study and results of related experiments are divided into three main parts: ultra high mass flux flow boiling experiments, the effect of <b>inlet</b> <b>restrictions</b> and tube size on premature critical heat flux in microchannels and flow boiling heat transfer enhancement via coating polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate (pHEMA) on inner microtube walls. In the first part, microchannels having ~ 250 μm and ~ 500 μm hydraulic diameters were tested at various ultra high mass fluxes values and different heated length for forcing the conventional heat removal limits of flow boiling via microchannels. De-ionized water was used as working fluid and test section was heated with Joule heating. Wall temperatures for each case were recorded and exit qualities were calculated. The resulting CHF boiling curve demonstrates cooling rates (> 30000 W/cm 2) that were never achieved by flow boiling in microchannels could be obtained. In {{the second part of the}} present study, useful information about premature CHF phenomena was provided. The study offers a parametric comparative investigation. Experimental data are obtained from microtubes having 250 ~μm and 685 ~ μm inner diameters, which were tested at low mass fluxes (78. 9 - 276. 3 kg/m 2 s) to reveal potential boiling instability mechanisms. Moreover, <b>inlet</b> <b>restrictions</b> were introduced to the system for observing their effect in mitigating unstable boiling conditions and extending the boiling curve. De-ionized water was used as a coolant, while microtubes having 5, 65 cm heated length were heated by Joule heating. Furthermore, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the deduced data is performed for revealing the frequency correlations of the every obtained temperature and pressure oscillations before and just before the premature dryout condition. The results show the <b>inlet</b> <b>restrictions</b> have a significant effect on reducing the unstable boiling fluctuations and the proposed FFT method was proved to be a useful tool to detect premature dryout before it occurs. In the third part, flow boiling heat transfer experiments were conducted on microtubes (inner diameter of ~ 250 μm, ~ 500 μm and ~ 1 mm) with a constant heated length 2 cm and with enhanced inner surfaces having deposited polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate (pHEMA), which extends the boiling curve, increases the heat transfer surface area, and provides additional nucleation sites. De-ionized water was utilized as the working fluid and test section was heated by Joule heating in this study. Nanostructures on the microtube walls were coated through initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) technique. A significant extension in CHF boiling curve and increase in heat transfer were observed with nanostructure-enhanced surfaces compared to the plain surface counterparts for two relatively high mass velocities, namely, 10000 kg/m 2 s and 13000 kg/m 2 s...|$|R

The flashing phenomenon and the associated flow instabilities in a natural circulation loop are reported here. An experimental facility is constructed with a heater, an adiabatic riser, a condenser and an adiabatic down comer to study the instability regions. The experimental geometry is modeled using RELAP 5. At high power (Le., at 6 kW) flashing instability is observed when the inlet sub cooling is {{within the range of}} 7 degrees C to 12 degrees C. It is also found that the presence of an <b>inlet</b> <b>restriction</b> does not help to suppress the flashing induced flow oscillation.

Non-dimensional numbers are identified. Numerical simulation, using R-ELAP 5, has been conducted to model the natural circulation loops. The single channel loop is further modified to study flashing by using two parallel risers. Stable flashing could not be attained with both the channels. However, using parallel channels in the single phase region which combine into a single channel in the zone where flashing occur produced stable flow It is observed that a stable flashing driven two-phase flow occurs only by reducing the inlet subcooling to a very low value with respect to the riser evil pressure. The presence of <b>inlet</b> <b>restriction</b> does not help in reducing the oscillation period, but the stable flashing was observed at lower power values. The initial pressurization and subsequent depressurization to the desired working pressure of the system reduces the flow instabilities considerably.

40|$|A {{computational}} fluid dynamic (CFD) {{model of}} a rotating detonation engine (RDE) is {{used to examine the}} impact of an exhaust throat (i. e. a constriction) on performance. The model simulates an RDE which is premixed, adiabatic, inviscid, and which contains an inlet valve that prevents backflow from the high pressure region directly behind the rotating detonation. Performance is assessed in terms of ideal net specific impulse which is computed on the assumption of lossless expansion of the working fluid to the ambient pressure through a notional diverging nozzle section downstream of the throat. Such a semi-idealized analysis, while not real-world, allows the effect of the throat to be examined in isolation from, rather than coupled to (as it actually is) various loss mechanisms. For the single Mach 1. 4 flight condition considered, it is found that the addition of a throat can yield a 9. 4 percent increase in specific impulse. However, it is also found that when the exit throat restriction gets too small, an unstable type of operation ensues which eventually leads to the detonation failing. This behavior is found to be somewhat mitigated by the addition of an RDE <b>inlet</b> <b>restriction</b> across which there is an aerodynamic loss. Remarkably, this loss is overcome by the benefits of the further exhaust restrictions allowed. The end result is a configuration with a 10. 3 percent improvement in ideal net specific thrust...|$|E
40|$|The in situ {{activity}} {{and distribution of}} heterotrophic and nitrifying bacteria and their potential interactions were investigated in a full-scale, two-section, trickling filter designed for biological degradation of volatile organics and NH 3 in ventilation air from pig farms. The filter biofilm was investigated by microsensor analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization, quantitative PCR, and batch incubation activity measurements. In situ aerobic activity showed a significant decrease through the filter, while the distribution of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) was highly skewed toward the filter outlet. Nitrite oxidation was not detected {{during most of the}} experimental period, and the AOB activity therefore resulted in NO 2 −, accumulation, with concentrations often exceeding 100 mM at the filter <b>inlet.</b> The <b>restriction</b> of AOB to the outlet section of the filter was explained by both competition with heterotrophic bacteria for O 2 and inhibition by the protonated form of NO 2 −, HNO 2.

There is a dearth of design data for horizontal thermosyphons hence the transient behaviour of a horizontal thermosyphon reboiler loop has been studied experimentally here. Most studies here have explored and defined geysering instability in single and parallel vertical columns with closed bottom end. This study presents geysering detected in 51 mm riser of a horizontal thermosyphon reboiler. Experiments were undertaken with water as the process fluid and steam as the heating medium, using 6 – 20 kW/m 2 heat flux, 1. 165 – 1. 265 m static head and a range of recycle flow restrictions. Pressure, temperature and flow rate data were continuously logged at 100 Hz. Flow rate was examined as a significant indicator of instability since it is the parameter with highest and varied amplitude of oscillation. Heat flux is most significant for stability: above 20 kW/m 2, the system is stable; between 11 – 20 kW/m 2 there are varying degrees of sustained oscillations and below 11 kW/m 2 flow rate is low. Reboiler <b>inlet</b> flow <b>restriction</b> also stabilises the system by reducing the flow rate to such a level that heat transfer rate can maintain a consistent vapour product rate. Static head influences the recirculation rate and subcooling at the reboiler inlet, but has a secondary effect on stability.

5000|$|Although {{controversy}} arose between Stephenson's {{design and}} the Davy lamp (invented by Humphry Davy in the same year), Stephenson's original design worked on significantly different principles from Davy's final design. If the lamp were sealed except for a restricted air ingress (and a suitably sized chimney) then the presence of dangerous amounts of firedamp in the incoming air would (by its combustion) reduce the oxygen concentration inside the lamp {{so much that the}} flame would be extinguished. (Stephenson had convinced himself of the validity of this approach by his experiments with candles near lit blowers: as lit candles were placed upwind of the blower the blower flame grew duller; with enough upwind candles the blower flame went out.) To guard against the possibility of a flame travelling back through the incoming gases (an explosive backblast), air ingress was by a number of small-bore orifices through which the air flowed at a velocity higher than the velocity of the flame in a mixture of firedamp (mostly methane) and air. The body of the lamp was lengthened to give the flame a greater convective draw, and thus allow a greater <b>inlet</b> flow <b>restriction</b> and make the lamp less sensitive to air currents. Davy had originally attempted a safety lamp on similar principles, before preferring to enclose the flame inside a brass gauze cylinder; he had publically identified the importance of allowing the restricted airflow in through small orifices (in which the flame velocity is lower) before Stephenson had, and he and his adherents remained convinced that Stephenson had not made this discovery independently.|$|R
40|$|High heat {{transfer}} rates at reasonably low temperature differences {{can be obtained}} by utilizing a boiling fluid. The use of boiling {{heat transfer}} is often limited by onset of a heat transfer crisis named the Critical Heat Flux (CHF). The CHF is accompanied by an inordinate increase in temperature with the most severe consequence being related to the physical burnout of the heated surface. Two-phase boiling flows in channels are sometimes prone to flow instabilities. Density Wave Oscillations (DWO) is {{the most common type of}} thermo-hydraulic instability. DWO are fluid waves of alternating higher and lower densities propagating across the system. It is characterized by large cyclic fluctuations in flow rate and pressure and has a period of about twice the heated channel transit time. The literature survey condenses previous results and identifies different approaches for obtaining them in experimental studies. The purpose of this study is to perform an experimental investigation on the effect of flow instabilities on the heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop characteristics of a 5 mm uniformly heated horizontal boiling in-tube system utilizing R 134 a as the working fluid. The experiments confirmed that the system stability is improved by opening the <b>inlet</b> <b>restriction</b> valve and omitting exit orifice. The influence of the pump system characteristics on DWO was also explored. Establishing an unconditional stable system configuration allowed for generation of reference data. DWO was found to occur when vapor quality becomes sufficiently high in a system operating with inlet and exit restrictions and some degree of inlet subcooling. Mimicking DWO by superimposing flow oscillations by cycling the pump drive was also a viable solution. It was found that the overall heat transfer decreased proportionally to the flow amplitude. Shifting the period of oscillation from its natural frequency to lower frequencies reduces the heat transfer. The saturated boiling heat transfer coefficient was highly dependent on heat flux, and almost independent of flow rate, indicating that nucleate boiling was the dominant heat transfer mechanism. Comparisons were made to saturated boiling correlations. Heat transfer scales generally well with pressure drop, except a sudden reduction when DWO commences. The local heat transfer coefficient in the test section outlet increased with heat flux until it suddenly dropped due to an abrupt increase in wall temperature, distinguished as the normal CHF. The onset of DWO was found to trigger premature CHF at heat fluxed of about 90 % the normal CHF. </p...|$|E
40|$|Two-phase natural {{circulation}} loops are unstable at low pressure operating conditions. New reactor design relying on {{natural circulation}} for both normal and abnormal core cooling {{is susceptible to}} different types of flow instabilities. In contrast to forced circulation boiling water reactor (BWR), natural circulation BWR is started up without recirculation pumps. The tall chimney placed {{on the top of}} the core makes the system susceptible to flashing during low pressure start-up. In addition, the considerable saturation temperature variation may induce complicated dynamic behavior driven by thermal non-equilibrium between the liquid and steam. ^ The thermal-hydraulic problems in two-phase natural circulation systems at low pressure and low power conditions are investigated through experimental methods. Fuel heat conduction, neutron kinetics, flow kinematics, energetics and dynamics that govern the flow behavior at low pressure, are formulated. A dimensionless analysis is introduced to obtain governing dimensionless groups which are groundwork of the system scaling. ^ Based on the robust scaling method and start-up procedures of a typical natural circulation BWR, the simulation strategies for the transient with and without void reactivity feedback is developed. Three different heat-up rates are applied to the transient simulations to study characteristics of the stability during the start-up. Reducing heat-up rate leads to increase in the period of flashing-induced density wave oscillation and decrease in the system pressurization rate. However, reducing the heat-up rate is unable to completely prevent flashing-induced oscillations. ^ Five characteristic regions of stability are discovered at low pressure conditions. They are stable single-phase, flashing near the separator, intermittent oscillation, sinusoidal oscillation and low subcooling stable regions. ^ Stability maps were acquired for system pressures ranging 100 kPa to 400 kPa. According to experimental investigation, the flow becomes stable below a certain heat flux regardless of the inlet subcooling at the core and system pressure. At higher heat flux, unstable phenomena were indentified within a certain range of inlet subcooling. The unstable region diminishes as the system pressure increases. ^ In natural circulation BWRs, the significant gravitational pressure drop over the tall chimney section induces a Type-I instability. The Type-I instability becomes especially important during low power and pressure conditions during reactor start-up. Under these circumstances the effect of pressure variations on the saturation enthalpy becomes significant. ^ An experimental study shows that the flashing phenomenon in the adiabatic chimney section is dominant during the start-up of a natural circulation BWR. Since flashing occurs outside the core, nuclear feedback effects on the stability are small. Furthermore, the thermal-hydraulic oscillation period is much longer than power fluctuation period caused by void reactivity feedback. ^ In the natural circulation system increasing the <b>inlet</b> <b>restriction</b> reduces the natural circulation flow rate, shifting the unstable region to higher inlet subcooling. ...|$|E
40|$|New {{production}} techniques, {{which became}} available since the 1980 ’s, allowed the mass production of small sized fluidic systems. Reducing {{the size of}} a technical system alters the performance due to scaling effects. Physical phenomena which operate on volumes, such as gravity and inertia, become less important with respect to physical phenomena which act on surfaces or lines, such as pressure differences and surface tension. This relatively new research area on small sized fluidic systems is called “micro-fluidics”. An illustrative example on the size reduction of an evaporator system shows a possible advantage of scaling down a physical process. To characterise micro-fluidic flow dimensionless numbers can be used, such as the Reynolds number (Re), Weber number (We), Knudsen number (Kn) and Bond number (Bo). Gas-liquid two-phase flow systems are regarded to be small (or confined) if the Bond number is smaller than 4, or its square root inverse (i. e. the confinement number, Co) should be larger than 0. 5. The present work investigated the interaction of phase transition heat transfer and two-phase flow behaviour in small geometries. In order to get insight into the various interactions the research is split into two parts: 1. interaction between two-phase flow and small geometries, 2. interaction between phase transition heat transfer and small geometries. The typical size of the “small geometries” regarded here range from about 5 mm down to about 0. 1 mm. Furthermore, in general the liquid phase is water and the gaseous phase is either air or water vapour. In general standard conditions (i. e. pressure ~ 1 bar and ambient temperature ~ 293 K) are considered. As a theoretical background the most commonly used two-phase flow concepts are introduced, such as the void fraction, superficial velocity, and two-phase flow pattern map. In literature an alternation in two-phase flow pattern map is observed on reducing the channel diameter. For example no horizontally stratified flow occurs in concurrent two-phase flow in small diameter channels. Only three anchor flow regimes are identified: bubble flow, slug flow, and annular flow. Textbook knowledge and {{the state of the art}} insights are presented on boiling bubble behaviour, nucleate pool boiling, and flow boiling. Various heat transfer mechanisms during nucleate boiling are described, as well as their interactions and relative importance. An overview is given in literature readily available two-phase flow pattern maps, which are measured within small diameter channels (0. 5 0. 5). The present work extends the researched regions of the two-phase flow pattern map to much lower superficial liquid velocities, in which the occurrence of stratified flow might be expected. The present experiments show no stratified flow or wavy flow pattern region. Therefore, in order to theoretically predict the transition lines the stratified flow is most likely not the most adequate initial two-phase flow pattern. Annular flow is suggested to be a more appropriate initial two-phase flow pattern. The present work on confined pool boiling demonstrates an enhancement of the nucleate boiling heat flux when the boiling pot diameter is decreased (i. e. increased confinement). In the nucleate boiling regime the heat flux in confined pool boiling is between 5 to 10 times higher than the heat flux for unconfined pool boiling. The analysis of possible errors and a variation of experimental parameters excludes that the observed enhancement is the result of the chosen boiling liquid, the variation in boiling pot depth, the material of the bounding wall, or the variation in the diameter of the inlet water supply. An explanation is found in the singularisation of the basic process for nucleate pool boiling, leading to a different flow behaviour. The flow pattern is chaotic in the case of unconfined pool boiling, and it becomes directed and circulating as the dimensions of the confinement are reduced. The circulating fluid motion augments the entrainment of liquid by the vapour bubbles, and hence it significantly increases the heat transfer in the nucleate boiling regime. Confined pool boiling could be integrated on a large scale by means of ‘numbering up’ or ‘scaling out’. Our research on flow boiling in small diameter channels gives a better understanding of the origin of the pressure fluctuations and the possible flow reversal. First, the measured length of a slug bubble at detachment agrees with the trend obtained by scaling analysis using a hydrodynamic force balance. The slope of the predicted linear correlation through the measurements corresponds to a 2 % film thickness. This relative film thickness is similar to the values given in literature. By applying a similar hydrodynamic force balance on a multiple channel array, a criterion is found predicting vapour flow reversal. Within the flow reversal criterion the bubble cap position as a function of time is an important parameter. High-speed camera recordings allowed us to obtain the vapour bubble length during its explosive growth. Using simple assumptions we found an explicit relation for the vapour bubble length in time. After optimisation of the film thickness, this relation shows reasonable agreement with our explosive bubble length measurements. The explosive bubble growth model combined with the criterion predicting vapour flow reversal allows us to design the <b>inlet</b> <b>restriction.</b> Process and EnergyMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} processes {{can greatly}} {{benefit from the}} use of the boiling and condensation in two-phase flows. However, the use of two-phase flows may induce instabilities in the heat transfer system, causing control problems and possible damage to the equipment. Pressure Drop Oscillations (PDOs) are one of the instabilities prone to occur in convective heat transfer systems. The PDOs are characterized by oscillations of low frequency with interfering, high frequency signals known as Density Wave Oscillations (DWOs). In {{order to be able to}} control this kind of oscillations in a thermal system, a better understanding of the parameters affecting the PDOs is needed. In this thesis, experimental work considering the effect of the external system and heat flux on the PDOs have been performed using the Two-Phase Flow Instability Facility located at the Varmeteknisk lab, EPT, NTNU. During the experiments, a single, horizontal channel of 5 mm inner diameter was used as the test section, R 134 a as the working fluid and a regulative surge tank containing nitrogen gas was used as the the compressible volume required for occurrence of PDOs. For the external system, experimental analyses of the effect of the <b>inlet</b> and outlet <b>restrictions</b> of the heated test section, different compressible volumes and the pump bypass were conducted. It was shown that a restriction of either the inlet or outlet of the test section reduced the PDOs. Larger compressible volumes increased the PDOs, while they decreased for smaller volumes. With the use of a pump bypass, the system stabilized faster with regards to the PDOs. Different heat fluxes applied to the test section showed that the PDOs could be regulated by both the amount and the distribution of the heat applied. For an uniform, decreasing heat flux the PDOs decreased, while for an uniform, increasing heat flux the PDOs first increased before decreasing in magnitude. Both a linear increasing and decreasing heat profile were applied to the test section. The results showed that the decreasing heat profile, generating larger amount of vapour in the test section, increased the PDOs and especially the interfering, high frequency signals. The increasing heat profile had a stabilizing effect on the system. A discussion concerning the interfering, high frequency signals that were observed to occur together with the PDOs was carried out along with experiments resulting in a conclusion that the signals may actually be another kind of oscillations than the DWOs...|$|R
