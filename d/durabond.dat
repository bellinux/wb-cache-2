5000|$|In 2014, he {{was chosen}} to be {{featured}} in Yerba Buena Center for the Arts' triennial [...] "Bay Area Now 7", which garnered considerable press coverage, including a review by San Francisco Chronicle's Kenneth Baker and the San Francisco Arts Quarterly. Graven created an installation and intervention that directly engaged the museum staff {{in a series of}} experimental trust exercises. In one of his undertakings, he met with YBCA's accountant requesting a blank check. With the staff member in attendance, he destroyed the check by repeatedly submerging it in one of the museum's 5 gallon buckets of black paint. All the materials used in the art piece were acquired from the museum on site, which included brass art-hanging-hardware with nails, <b>Durabond</b> joint compound (5 min set), Westpac Fast Set Patching Compound, Fix-It-All, drywall, YBCA hammer, latex paint-covered paper (blank check from YBCA, 24-page printouts of email correspondences between museum and artist to establish trust, photocopy of driver’s license and social security card, photocopy of I-9, and photocopy of W-4), mason line string, labels with thread, numbered gallery pins, striping tape, painter's tape, furniture wrap, plastic drop, paint, graphite, and ink.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{castability}} of Co-Cr-Mo-W (Remanium 2000), Ni-Cr (<b>Durabond)</b> and Co-Cr-Mo (Vera PDI) alloys invested with either conventional (phosphate- and silica-based) or mixed investing techniques. A 10 X 10 mm square-shaped nylon net containing 100 open squares served as a template for construction of wax patterns, which were invested with phosphate-based investment (Termocast), silica-based investment (Refrafil) and mixed investing technique (2 -mm layer phosphate investment plus filling with silica investment). Forty-five cast specimens (5 per experimental condition) were obtained and sandblasted with aluminum oxide. The number of completely reproduced cast segments was counted to obtain a percentage designated "castability value", which indicated the accuracy of the alloy to reproduce mold details. Statistical analysis using two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test showed that, comparing the alloys, Remanium 2000 had statistically similar castability (p> 0. 05) to Vera PDI and lower than <b>Durabond</b> (p 0. 05). In conclusion, the castability of the Co-Cr-Mo-W alloy (Remanium 2000) was comparable to that of the Co-Cr alloy (Vera PDI) and worse than that of the Ni-Cr alloy (<b>Durabond).</b> Except for Remanium 2000, the mixed investing technique considerably improved the accuracy of the alloys to reproduce cast details, compared to the phosphate-based investment. The mixed investing technique appears as a viable alternative to improve castability of base metal alloys without decreasing the surface quality of the metallic pieces...|$|E
30|$|Yeast {{cells were}} precultured aerobically in YPD medium at 30 °C for 72  h, {{harvested}} by centrifugation at 1, 000 [*]×[*]g for 5  min, and then washed twice with distilled water. The wet-cell weight was then determined by harvesting the washed cells by centrifugation at 3, 000 [*]×[*]g for 5  min and weighing the cell pellet. The cells were then resuspended to an initial cell concentration of 200 -g wet cells/L in 20  mL of YP medium containing 20  g/L of PASC. Ethanol fermentation proceeded at 37 °C for 96  h with mild agitation in 100 -mL closed bottles, each {{equipped with a}} siliconized tube and check valve as a CO 2 outlet. Ethanol concentration was determined using a gas chromatograph (model GC- 2010; Shimadzu) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a <b>Durabond</b> Free Fatty Acid Phase (DB-FFAP) column (60  m[*]×[*] 0.25  mm internal diameter; 0.5  μm film thickness; Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Helium {{was used as the}} carrier gas. The injection volume and split ratio were adjusted to 1  μL and 1 : 50, respectively. The column temperature was programmed to increase from 40 °C to 170 °C with a linear gradient of 10 °C/min.|$|E
40|$|The {{continuous}} {{technological advance}} and increasing availability of new base metal alloys and ceramic {{systems in the}} market, coupled {{to the demands of}} daily clinical practice, have made the constant evaluation of the bond strength of metal/porcelain combinations necessary. This study evaluated the metal/porcelain shear bond strength of three ceramic systems (Duceram, Williams and Noritake) in combination with three nickel-chromium (Ni-Cr) alloys (<b>Durabond,</b> Verabond and Viron). Thirty cast cylinder specimens (15 mm high; 6 mm in diameter) were obtained for each alloy, in a way that 10 specimens of each alloy were tested with each porcelain. Bond strength was measured with an Emic screw-driven mechanical testing machine by applying parallel shear forces to the specimens until fracture. Shear strength was calculated using the ratio of the force applied to a demarcated area of the opaque layer. Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical analysis of the alloy/ceramic combinations (p 0. 05) were observed among the other combinations. In conclusion, the Noritake ceramic system used together with Viron alloy presented the highest resistance to shear forces, while Duceram bonded to Verabond presented the lowest bond strength. Viron/Duceram and Verabond/Noritake provided intermediate results. The combinations between the Williams ceramic system and Ni-Cr alloys had similar shear strengths among each other...|$|E
40|$|Ceramometal bond {{strength}} has {{played an important}} role for the replacement of gold alloys by nickel-chromium alloys in dentistry. This study evaluated the metal/porcelain {{bond strength}} of three ceramic systems (Vita VMK 88, Williams and Duceram) associated with three nickel-chromium alloys (<b>Durabond,</b> Lite Cast B and Resistal P) and one experimental cobalt-chromium-titanium alloy. Thirty cast cylinder specimens (15 mm in height; 6 mm in diameter) were obtained for each alloy, in away that 10 specimens of each alloy were tested with each porcelain. Bond strength was measured with an Emic screw-driven mechanical testing machine by applying parallel shear forces to the specimens until fracture. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for statistical analysis of the alloy/ceramic combinations (p< 0. 05). Resistal P/Duceram had significantly higher bond strength (44. 38 ± 9. 12 MPa) (p< 0. 05) than the other combinations, except for Co-Cr-Ti alloy/Vita VMK 88 (38. 41 ± 12. 64 MPa). The association of the experimental Co-Cr-Ti alloy with Williams porcelain had significantly higher bond strength (28. 20 ± 3. 86 MPa) than the combination of other alloys with the same porcelain (p< 0. 05). Based of these results and within the limitations of an in vitro study, it may be concluded that the bond strength of the three ceramic systems to the Ni-Cr and Co-Cr-Ti alloys varied significantly, indicating that metal/ceramic compatibility was very important to the bond strength...|$|E
