40|$|Background: Restless legs {{syndrome}} (RLS) is {{a neurological}} condition that {{is characterized by}} the irresistible urge to move the legs and is very common. In the last decade, much attention has been focused on RLS, given its high occurrence, underdiagnosis, and impact on quality of Ufe. Aim: To determine the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>RLS</b> in a neurologic-psychiatric outpatient clinic. Patients and Methods: We interviewed patients attending a prívate neurological outpatient clinic, using a standardized validated questionnaire, and an additional phone interview to confirm diagnosis. Results: Of approximately 800 people attending the clinic, the questionnaire was answered by 238 subjects (168 females). Fifteen percent of respondents were affected by RLS and none had been diagnosed before. Most patients had a severe form that probably required treatment.

40|$|Pairs {{of actions}} such as write x throw and throw x racquet were {{examined}} for {{items of the}} Annett Hand Preference Questionnaire (AHPQ). Right (R) and left (L) responses were described for <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> RR, <b>RL,</b> LR and LL pairings (write x throw etc.) in a large representative combined sample {{with the aim of}} discovering the distribution over the population as a whole. The <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> <b>RL</b> pairings varied significantly over the different item pairs but the <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> LR pairings were fairly constant. An important difference was found between primary actions (originally write, throw, racquet, match, toothbrush, hammer with the later addition of scissors for right-handers) and non-primary actions (needle and thread, broom, spade, dealing playing cards and unscrewing the lid of a jar). For primary actions, there were similar numbers of right and left writers using the ‘other’ hand. For non-primary actions more right-handers used the left hand than for primary actions but more left-handers did not use the right hand. That is, different <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> response to primary versus non-primary actions were found for right-handers but not for left-handers.

40|$|One of {{the of the}} key {{barriers}} that hampers effective and efficient management of reverse flows detected within a number of empirical surveys and case studies focused on reverse logistics and/or return management is business (organisational) policy, specifically lack of policy, deficiency in existing policy or inferior policy. Despite this fact, there is a gap in literature which would show some evidence from practice that innovative reverse logistics policy both can pay off and is associated with certain aspects of reverse logistics management. Such proof can have several implications. It can support the call for better understanding and more research of the linkages of reverse logistics with other corporate functions, promote the acceptation of strategic character of reverse logistics and stress the role <b>of</b> <b>RL</b> policy within the rest of overall corporate management. The aim {{of this paper is}} to contribute and to enrich the existing body of knowledge concerning the above-mentioned gap through presentation of survey results that was realized in 2012 among managers of 244 Czech firms.

40|$|The {{increased}} input <b>of</b> <b>RL</b> into LN starts within 3 h after {{antigenic stimulation}} and {{is due to}} {{an increase in the number}} <b>of</b> <b>RL</b> passing through a LN. It is not associated with an altered transit time through a LN of the majority <b>of</b> <b>RL</b> and it cannot occur in the absence of high endothelial PCV. The immediate decrease in the output <b>of</b> <b>RL</b> from an antigen-stimulated LN is due to a delay in the exit from that LN <b>of</b> <b>RL</b> which had entered the LN before antigen was given. The decrease in cell output from a LN after antigen administration affects blast cells produced within the LN as well as small lymphocytes and is not specific for RL.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{pathophysiology}} of migraine and {{restless legs}} syndrome (RLS) seems to involve inherited mechanism and dysfunction of the dopaminergic system. Previous articles {{have shown that the}} <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>RLS</b> is higher in migraine patients than in controls.

Data including RLS diagnosis, depressive symptoms, comorbidities and drugs used were evaluated. RESULTS: There was a significant association between migraine and RLS (p= 0. 01), but comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, anemia and drugs used did not explain this association.

40|$|Background. To {{investigate}} {{the frequency of}} restless leg syndrome (RLS), sleep quality impairment, depression, fatigue, and sleep behavior disorder and {{to determine the effects}} of surgery on these parameters in radiculopathy patients resistant to conservative treatment. Methods. The present study included 66 lumbar radiculopathy patients, who were resistant to conservative treatment and had indication of surgery. Five different questionnaires were performed to assess depression (the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)), sleep quality (the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)), fatigue (the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)), and presence of RLS and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD). The same questionnaires were also performed on a control group (n= 61). Results. Of the radiculopathy patients, 68. 1 % had RLS and 92. 4 % had fatigue. Of the controls, 16. 4 % had RLS and 59 % had fatigue. RBD was present in 8 (12. 1 %) patients and 3 (4. 9 %) controls. The PSQI revealed that sleep quality was impaired in 46 (69. 7 %) patients and 35 (57. 4 %) controls (P> 0. 05).

40|$|The article {{presents}} empirical survey results concerning two objectives. The first {{objective was to}} describe barriers <b>of</b> reverse logistics (<b>RL)</b> development in Czech companies. The other one was to research whether there are different views of these barriers between company experts and top managers. The analyses are based on data obtained through a questionnaire survey of 102 representatives of companies operating in the Czech Republic. The study applied basic statistical methods used in quantitative research. Based on answer <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> respondents, the main internal barrier <b>of</b> <b>RL</b> development is its little importance in comparison with other activities, followed {{by the lack of}} systematic management, and unskilled workforce. On the other hand, customers are regarded as the most significant external barrier due to their careless handling with products and packaging as well as their pressure on the sale price. The obtained data also speak volumes about the differences in the view <b>of</b> the <b>RL</b> importance (in {{the second part of the}} article).

40|$|Objective: Restless legs {{syndrome}} (RLS) is a sensorimotor disease {{characterized by}} uncomfortable sensations {{in the legs}} and an urge to move the legs, increased symptoms during rest or inactivity and at night, and relief of the symptoms by voluntary movements. The prevalence of RLS varies from 5 % to 15 %. Although it is commonly seen in middle-and advanced-age individuals, one-third of patients experience the symptoms before 20 years of age. In this study, we aimed to determine the frequency and awareness of RLS in young-age group. Methods: Our study was conducted among the students at Ordu University. The participants were interviewed based on a questionnaire. The subjects were interviewed for personal information {{and then they were}} asked the four questions essential for a diagnosis of RLS. Results: A total of 163 students - 60 female (37 %) and 103 male (63 %) - participated in the study. The <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>RLS</b> was 26 % (n= 16) in females and 13 % (n= 14) in males. 23. 3 % (n= 7) of participants with RLS answered “yes” the question “Do you consult a doctor for your complaints?”. Of these students, 10 % (n= 3) preferred a neurologist and 13. 3 % (n= 4) stated that an orthopedist should be consulted.

40|$|Background: Restless legs {{syndrome}} (RLS) is {{a common}} movement disorder. The occurrence of this syndrome is due to genetic factors and lifestyle. This study performed to determine restless legs syndrome (RLS) prevalence in Iranian multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and the possible risk factors. Methods : This cross-sectional {{study was conducted with}} MS patients, and the age- and sex-matched control group comprised healthy persons. Then, all subjects were asked about RLS symptoms. After the diagnosis of RLS, the patients were divided into two groups: With and without RLS. In both groups, the following variables were evaluated: Age, sex, other underlying disease, duration of MS, MS course, family history of RLS, history of anemia, and drug intakes. The severity of the disease in subjects diagnosed with RLS was also evaluated. Results: A total of 126 patients in the MS group and 126 healthy controls were included in the study, with no statistically significant differences between them in terms of age and gender. In MS group, 82 (65. 1 %) and, in control group, 16 (12. 7 %) had RLS. The <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>RLS</b> in the MS patients was significantly higher than that in the control group.

We review recent spectral and variability studies <b>of</b> <b>RL</b> AGNs, which show that these systems have systematically different X-ray properties than their radio-quiet (RQ) counterparts. Specifically, RL AGNs have weaker and narrower Fe K lines and weaker Compton reflection components above 10 keV. The nuclear continuum <b>of</b> <b>RL</b> AGNs in the 2 [...] 10 keV band is well described by a power law with photon indices ∼ 1. 8, similar to RQ AGNs of comparable X-ray luminosity. RL AGNs have little or no flux variability on short time scales (0. 5 days); however, flux and spectral variations are observed on time scales of weeks in two well-monitored objects, 3 C 390. 3 and 3 C 120. These properties strongly suggest that the central engines of the two AGNs classes are different. We discuss the implications of these observational results, in particular the possibility that the central engines <b>of</b> <b>RL</b> AGNs are harbor an ion torus (also known as an Advection-Dominated Accretion Flow or ADAF). We show that a beamed component from the jet is unlikely in the majority of sources. Moreover, the X-ray data provide evidence that the circumnuclear environs <b>of</b> <b>RL</b> and RQ AGNs also differ: large amounts of cold gas are detected in BLRGs and QSRs, contrary to Seyfert galaxies of similar X-ray luminosity where an ionized absorber seems to be the norm.
