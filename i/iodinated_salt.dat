5000|$|In the 1980s Hetzel, {{supported}} by the Australian Agency for International Development, became an international advocate for iodine supplementation, which is now taken for granted with <b>iodinated</b> table <b>salt.</b> This {{was part of the}} stimulus for the creation of the Iodine Global Network, then called the International Council for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders (ICCIDD), which is funded by various government, non-government and community organisations including the United Nations, the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition, UNICEF, the World Health Organization, and the World Bank.The ICCIDD is considered the expert body regarding iodine deficiency disorders and they implement national programs for the prevention of iodine deficiency. As a result of their advocacy, many countries have now legislated that salt for human and animal consumption must be iodised. Much of this success has been attributed to Hetzel's [...] "indefatigable dedication to elimination of iodine deficiency disorders." [...] In 2010, the ICCIDD established a Basil Hetzel International Award for Communications for individuals who contribute to promoting awareness of iodine nutrition. It is claimed that iodine supplementation has been achieved in 70% of households worldwide by 2000.|$|R
40|$|Background: Iodine {{deficiency}} disorders (IDD) is a {{major public}} health problem worldwide, {{in which more than}} two billion people have insufficient iodine intake, including 285 million school-age children. In Tanzania, 41 % of the population is at risk of IDD and 30 % of perinatal mortality is estimated to be attributable to iodine deficiency. Iodine deficiency is the number one cause of preventable brain damage in children and an important cause of infant deaths. The most cost-effective health intervention to correct IDD is universal salt iodation (USI). Tanzania has adopted USI since the early 1990 s, but not much is known about its impact on the population and the challenges that were met in implementing this programme in the developing world. Objective: The iodine status of the population following iodine supplementation and salt fortification interventions, and performance of salt iodation technologies used to optimise intervention strategies for sustainable elimination of IDD in Tanzania, have been investigated. Methods: Three cross-sectional surveys were carried out in: a) the most iodine deficient areas in 1999; b) low priority intervening areas of Zanzibar islands in 2001; c) a national survey in mainland Tanzania in 2004. These involved testing of salt consumed in the households, analysis of urinary iodine, and goitre assessment in > 160 000 school-age children, and d) another survey in mainland Tanzania, which investigated the status of the salt iodation machines {{and the quality of the}} product at salt factories. An experimental study was also carried out to improve the local technologies for salt iodation. Results: In the most IDD affected areas in Tanzania, total goitre prevalence (TGP) dropped from 65 % in 1980 s to 24 % in 1999, with 83 % of households consuming iodated salt. In Zanzibar islands where there was no intervention, TGP was 25. 6 %. Pemba Island had a higher TGP of 32 % with almost no iodated salt consumed in the households. In mainland Tanzania, a marked improvement was observed in the national survey with a drop of 25 % in TGP in school-age children in 1980 s to 6. 9 % in 2004, and currently 94. 5 % of school children aged 6 - 12 years have no goitre countrywide. However, excessive iodine intake (> 300 μg/l) was found in 35 % of the urine samples, raising concern as to the effectiveness of quality control at the salt production factories. Interviews with salt workers indicated that the standard iodation machines previously serving 140 salt works had been abandoned due to high running costs. Instead, simple iodation techniques using sprayers and sprinklers had been adapted to <b>iodinate</b> the <b>salt.</b> However, 24 % and 69 % of the salt samples analysed from these local technologies were over-iodinated or under-iodinated. The local technologies needed to be evaluated if they were to sustain USI. Improved local iodation methods and procedures, achieved homogenous iodine concentrations with 96 % of the salt samples falling within the recommended iodine level of 40 - 80 ppm. Discussion: It has been demonstrated that a huge improvement in iodine status of large Tanzanian population has resulted from the USI. This might have prevented thousands of child deaths in the country and spared millions of school children from substandard IQ levels, which were both the correct policies. USI has to be extended to cover the Islands of Zanzibar. Locally adopted salt iodation methods with low running costs need to be introduced and maintained in for sustainable IDD elimination. Efforts to enforce salt law and monitor the production and sales of iodated salt have to be stepped up throughout the country for each household to benefit from this cost-effective intervention...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is the study made for obtaining iodized oil that would satisfy the {{requirements}} in iodine for human body. The sunflower oil is a product with the most important value, thus the production of oil fortified with iodine would be a cheap and accessible option. These studies indicate that lipids present an important vehicle for the fortification with iodine. Eradication of the iodine deficiency may be realized not only by injection of the iodinated oil, but also by its use as an ingredient for the formulation of different food compositions. This method, complementary with the <b>iodinated</b> <b>salt,</b> would allow the increase of {{the efficiency of the}} prophylactic undertaken measures, because is based on the use of vegetal material – sunflower oil; it is cost-efficient and does not require substantial investments...|$|E
40|$|Recent data on iodine {{excretion}} in {{the urine}} of adults, adolescents and newborns and on the iodine content of breast milk indicate a high prevalence of iodine deficiency (moderate in many cases and severe in a few) in many European countries. These cases may manifest as subclinical hypothyroidism in neonates and as goitre in adolescents and adults. Lack of iodine causes not only goitre, but also mental deficiency, hearing loss and other neurological impairments, and short stature due to thyroid insufficiency during fetal development and childhood. Although <b>iodinated</b> <b>salt</b> is available theoretically in most countries where it is needed, its quality and {{share of the market}} are often unsatisfactory. In many countries where only household salt is iodinated the iodine content has been set too low owing to an overestimation of household salt consumption. Governments are therefore urged to pass legislation and provide means for efficient iodination of salt wherever this is necessary. SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background: Iodine {{deficiency}} and its related disorder such as goiter are endemic in Lorestan province. Following {{initiation of}} iodine deficiency control program in 1989, production, distribution {{and consumption of}} <b>iodinated</b> <b>salt</b> were begun. This survey was conducted {{in the framework of}} national monitoring survey in 2001 to find out the prevalence of goiter and urinary iodine level in order to evaluate the iodine status of school- aged children in Lorestan. Materials and Methods: 1200 schoolchildren, aged 7 - 10 years, were selected randomly from all regions of Lorestan. The grade of goiter in 600 boys and 600 girls, was determined according to WHO classification. Urinary iodine content was estimated using the digestion method in one tenth of the schoolchildren. Findings: Total goiter rate was 7. 8 % 7. 8 % in girls and 7. 7 % in boys. Median urinary iodine was 17 μg/dl. Urinary iodine was above 10 μg/dl in 85. 7 % and less than 5 μg/dl in 1. 7 %. No one had urinary iodine below 2 μg/dl. Conclusion: It is concluded that the rate of goiter in Lorestan has decreased significantly since 1996 and urinary iodine levels in schoolchildren are indicative of adequate iodine intake. Therefore Lorestan province can be considered as an 'iodine deficiency free' zone...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Iodine {{deficiency}} {{disorder is}} a major problem worldwide, especially during pregnancy and childhood. The magnitude of the problem is quite big in Ethiopia. The main aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the prevalence and severity of iodine deficiency disorders. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Shebe Senbo District on January 2011. Three elementary schools were selected by lottery method from 20 schools. From each school, students were selected by simple random sampling. Spot urine sample (5 ml) was taken to measure urine iodine level; physical exam was made to palpate goiter and salt samples were collected to estimate iodine content. RESULTS: Out of 389 participants, 179 (46 %) were males. The total goiter rate was 59. 1 % (Grade 1 : 35. 2 %; Grade 2 : 23. 9 %). The median urinary iodine level was 56 4 g/L that indicates iodine deficiency. Out of 389 households in the study area, 277 (71. 2 %) were using non-iodinated salt, 102 (26. 2 %) of the households were using <b>iodinated</b> <b>salt.</b> Cabbage usage was significantly associated with goiter. CONCLUSION: Endemic goiter is quite prevalent in the study area. Median urinary iodine value of the study samples was found to be far lower than standards. Quality of the salt used by the study population was found to be poor in its iodine content. The use of cabbage (goitrogen) has shown remarkable influence on the development of goiter.
