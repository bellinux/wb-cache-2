The notation was adopted by Barker when he joined Oracle and is effectively defined in his book Entity Relationship Modelling {{as part of the}} CASE Method series of books. This notation was and still is used by the Oracle CASE modelling tools. It is a variation of the [...] "crows foot" [...] style of data modelling that was favoured by many over the original Chen style of ERD modelling because of its readability and efficient use of <b>drawing</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{painting}} by I Wayan Pugur (b. 1945) shown here, was executed {{when he was}} 13 years old and was exhibited at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 1964, {{as part of a}} traveling exhibition in the United States in 1964-1965. This early drawing, executed on paper, exhibits the use of bright colors and a balanced composition. The <b>drawing</b> <b>space</b> is divided into three solid-color areas: dark blue, bright yellow and magenta in between showing the influence of the Wayang painting tradition. The leaves of the large tree with the snakes show the juxtaposition of complementary colors. The faces of the figures were drawn with no details, yet the snakes have eyes and long tongues.|$|E
5000|$|Thrasher {{said that}} he began <b>drawing</b> <b>Space</b> Moose while {{enrolled}} at Ross Sheppard High School in Edmonton {{in order to make}} a friend laugh. The first Space Moose comic premiered in the October 3, 1989, edition of The Gateway. In 1991 Thrasher left the University of Alberta and worked for Northwestern Utilities in Edmonton; during the four months he worked with the company, he did not produce any Space Moose comics, and the school newspaper replaced Space Moose's slot with Colby Christ, a comic about Colby Cosh, a friend of Thrasher. When Thrasher returned to the university, Colby Christ was replaced by Space Moose, which had resumed. Thrasher and Donald R. [...] "Don" [...] Husereau drew [...] "Colby Christ meets Space Moose," [...] a strip that was a segue between the series.|$|E

50|$|In the 1970s, {{miniature}} paintings {{emerged from}} Keliki, {{a small village}} north of Ubud, led by a local farmer I Ketut Sana. The sizes range from as small as 2 x 3 inch to as large as 10 x 15 in. I Ketut Sana learnt to paint from I Gusti Nyoman Sudara Lempad from Ubud and from I Wayan Rajin from Batuan. He combined the line drawing of Lempad and {{the details of the}} Batuan school. Every inch of the space is covered with minute details of Balinese village life and legends drawn in ink and colored with watercolor. The outcome is a marriage between the youthfulness of the Ubud school and the details of the Batuan School. The Keliki artists proud with their patience to paint minute details of every objects meticulously that occupy the <b>drawing</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
40|$|The work {{activity}} of {{small groups of}} three to four people was videotaped and analyzed {{in order to understand}} collaborative work and to guide the development of tools to support it. The software tools we currently have are often based on a single user model. Even those that are based on multiple user models define structures of interaction that restrict fluid collaboration. We need observe how people collaborate then build software that facilitates collaboration based on those observations, giving the users the toolsi that are “naturally” defined in face-to-face interaction. In this experiment small groups of people were observed in a collaborative design task using a shared <b>drawing</b> <b>space.</b> Specific features of collaborative {{work activity}} that raise design implications for collaborative technology: 1. collaborators use hand gestures to uniquely communicate significant information 2. the process of creating and using drawings conveys much information not contained in the resulting drawings 3. the <b>drawing</b> <b>space</b> is an important resource for the group in mediating their collaboration 4. there is a fluent mix of activity in the <b>drawing</b> <b>space</b> 5. the spatial orientation among the collaborators and the <b>drawing</b> <b>space</b> has a role in structuring their activit...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the use of}} referential communication in a simultaneous shared <b>drawing</b> <b>space</b> between a group of drawers and a guesser. The drawers ’ task was to collaboratively sketch a picture that illustrates a given word, so that a guesser can verbalize the word based on the picture. The verbal communication from the drawers to the guesser was restricted to promote the visual communication through the shared <b>drawing</b> <b>space.</b> The sequence of verbal interactions and drawings were recorded and mapped out on a timeline for analyses. The referential information was identified and categorized. The motivations of referential communication were discussed. Author Keywords CSCW, referential communication, shared drawing...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{focuses on}} the problem of {{designing}} and generating illustrations that portray a given scene with a single non-intersecting line. In this approach, users partition an image into regions, assigning a type or style to each of them. Next, a grid is generated over the <b>drawing</b> <b>space,</b> based on the parameters specified for each region. The illustration is then obtained {{in the form of a}} path that covers most areas of the grid. Contrary to previous works, our approach allows users to control the overall flow of the line throughout any given region, by providing the means to define tensor fields per region which directly influence the line orientation. We also extend this work for generating continuous line paintings, a similar style consisting of a single line that varies in color and thickness while covering the entire <b>drawing</b> <b>space.</b> This is achieved by transforming drawings obtained with the above mentioned approach through a Voronoi-based strategy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Various {{algorithms}} {{have been}} proposed for producing tidy drawings of trees-drawings that are aesthetically pleasing and use minimum <b>drawing</b> <b>space.</b> We show that these algorithms contain some difficulties that lead to aesthetically unpleasing, wider than necessary drawings. We then present a new algorithm with comparable time and storage requirements that produces tidier drawings. Generalizations to forests and m-ary trees are discussed, as are some problems in discretization when alphanumeric output devices are used. Index Terns-Data structures, trees, tree structures...|$|E

50|$|Giovanni Battista Piranesi was {{considered}} one of the greatest printmakers of the eighteenth century. He is notably one of the greatest printmakers of his time, where it is through this medium in which he demonstrated his mastering of etchings of imagined spaces. It was suggested that the <b>drawn</b> <b>spaces</b> would lose their magic and meaning if they were to be physically built in real life, as they would lose their unique forms of detail and intricacy, which is only achieved through drawings. The particular series of etchings 'Prisons (Carceri d'invenzione) or 'Imaginary Prisons,' depict his famous fictitious and atmospheric etchings of Rome's ancient remains, and his dreams of antiquity that often surpassed reality.|$|R
