5|$|My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic {{has been}} {{distributed}} to international markets, including Treehouse TV for the <b>English-speaking</b> <b>audience</b> in Canada, Boomerang in the United Kingdom until 2012 and on Tiny Pop and Pop (UK and Ireland), two British free-to-air children's television channels {{owned and operated}} by CSC Media Group, from September 2013, Okto in Singapore, Cartoon Network and later Boomerang with Eleven airing repeats in Australia and TV2 in New Zealand, ntv7 in Malaysia, E-Junior in the United Arab Emirates, Tooniverse in South Korea, and TV Tokyo (seasons 1–2), then Cartoon Network (season 3–present) in Japan. Some of these international broadcasts, including language translations, were arranged with Turner Broadcasting System, which had broadcast Friendship Is Magic and other Hasbro shows on many of their European and Middle Eastern channels. The Japanese broadcast of the show has two audio tracks: the original English-language audio track (available via SAP) and a Japanese-language audio track. According to Hasbro Studio's CEO Stephen Davis, they have marketed the show to over 180 territories around the world.|$|E
5|$|The Viz Media {{releases}} {{preserve the}} Japanese reading order and overlay the visual sound effects with equivalent English text. The English lettering {{was criticized for}} being overly large, which Anime News Network thought made the characters appear to be shouting at inappropriate moments. There are several additional differences between the Japanese and English volume releases of Zombiepowder.. The cover of the second manga volume, which featured an illustration of C.T. Smith holding {{a gun to his}} own head, was replaced in the English edition with new art of Gamma in sunglasses. The English editions of volumes 2-4 also each contain a one-shot story from early in Kubo's career, which were not present in the Japanese collections: Ultra Unholy Hearted Machine, Rune Master Urara, and Bad Shield United, respectively. These extra stories were included for two apparent reasons: to further appeal to Zombiepowder.s primary <b>English-speaking</b> <b>audience</b> of Bleach fans interested in the development of Tite Kubo's style, and to expand the length of the later volumes, which would otherwise have been shorter than Viz's normal releases, to standard pagecounts.|$|E
25|$|One {{important}} {{forerunner of}} the organized Left Wing Section of 1919 was the magazine The Class Struggle, founded by Ludwig Lore of the New Yorker Volkszeitung. Lore's magazine, which first saw print in May 1917, related current events in Europe and discussed matters of import written by various adherents of the Zimmerwald Left with an eager <b>English-speaking</b> <b>audience.</b> Co-editing the magazine with Lore were Louis C. Fraina, {{a former member}} of the Socialist Labor Party and voluminous writer on themes relating to the European revolutionary movement, and Louis Boudin, a well known Marxist theoretician.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} of his later works was his study of William Shakespeare (1897–1898), which was translated into English by William Archer and was highly acclaimed. It was, perhaps, history's most authoritative work on Shakespeare not principally intended for an <b>English-speaking</b> <b>audience.</b> He was afterwards engaged in writing a history of modern Scandinavian literature. In his critical work, which extended over a wider field than {{that of any other}} living writer, Brandes was aided by a singularly charming style, lucid and reasonable, enthusiastic but without extravagance, brilliant and colored without affectation. In 1900 he collected his works {{for the first time in}} a complete and popular edition and began to work on a German edition, completed in 1902.|$|E
25|$|Smith {{considers}} {{his treatment}} of Vagrant Story and Final Fantasy XII among his best translations. He looks to Vagrant Story as a title that demands to be in English and thought of his work as revealing the inner English game that always existed underneath. Smith was able to speak directly with Matsuno to improve the script translation, marking the first of their many collaborations. For Final Fantasy XII, his role entailed rebuilding the world to make sense for an <b>English-speaking</b> <b>audience.</b> He chose to portray the Archadian Imperials with a British accent to distinguish them from the American-accented Resistance members. For both of these titles, Smith relied on Matsuno's dense notes on the world's backstory to capture subtle and implied connections and preserve the rich texture of the game.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese {{also have}} {{many ways of}} {{indicating}} class distinctions. English is seen as more direct, one far more suited to the tough quality presented in hip-hop. Eventually, artists began translating music from English to Japanese and performing those direct translations, often leaving {{the bridge of the}} song in English to keep the catchiness of the rhymes and flow. Slowly, with the increase in popularity of rap in Japan, more rappers began using Japanese. Rappers added stressed syllables to their music, altering the natural flow of the language to fit into traditional hip-hop. American injections were also used in raps to help the flow of the music and often homonyms were placed in raps, which appealed both to the global <b>English-speaking</b> <b>audience</b> and to Japanese speakers, who often would understand the double meanings intended. Japanese was found to allow subtle put downs in raps, which appealed to many audiences.|$|E

[...] English-language editions took the title Passionate Journey after publication in a popular edition in the US in 1948. [...] An edition did not see print in England until Redstone Press published one in the 1980s. [...] It has also appeared in many other languages, including Chinese popular editions in 1933 and 1957. [...] Some editions since 1928 have cut two pages from the book: the 24th, in which the protagonist has sex with a prostitute; and the 149th, in which the protagonist, giant-sized, urinates on the city. [...] Dover Publications restored the pages in a 1971 edition, and American editions since then have kept them.|$|E

Amanda Edwards of Voxxi.com called it [...] "one of the most popular Latin love songs of all time", adding that, [...] "from her sweet voice to the genuine sentiment of the song (with a hint of sexiness if you're listening carefully), we're sold on this track being a solid standby any time of year but especially for someone hoping for romance on Valentine's Day".

The song was given heavy rotation in the southern United States, becoming the most played song in Kansas City, Miami, and Boston and the second most played in Los Angeles. In Tucson, Arizona, it was played every 2½ hours, and in San Antonio every hour. The song was played 25 times its first day of availability on US radios on the Harrington, Texas radio station KBTQ. It helped increase Selena's catalogue sales and simultaneously boosted media attention. The song's release sparked a two-day [...] "on-air blitz" [...] on radios in South Texas.

500|$|While vacationing at his sister's {{house in}} Coimbatore, in 1933, Narayan met {{and fell in}} love with Rajam, a 15-year-old girl who lived nearby. Despite many astrological and {{financial}} obstacles, Narayan managed to gain permission from the girl's father and married her. Following his marriage, Narayan became a reporter for a Madras-based paper called The Justice, dedicated to the rights of non-Brahmins. The publishers were thrilled to have a Brahmin Iyer in Narayan espousing their cause. The job brought him in contact with a wide variety of people and issues. Earlier, Narayan had sent the manuscript of Swami and Friends to a friend at Oxford, and about this time, the friend showed the manuscript to Graham Greene. Greene recommended the book to his publisher, and it was finally published in 1935. Greene also counseled Narayan on shortening his name to become more familiar to the <b>English-speaking</b> <b>audience.</b> The book was semi-autobiographical and built upon many incidents from his own childhood. Reviews were favourable but sales were few. Narayan's next novel The Bachelor of Arts (1937), was inspired in part by his experiences at college, and dealt with the theme of a rebellious adolescent transitioning to a rather well-adjusted adult; it was published by a different publisher, again at the recommendation of Greene. His third novel, The Dark Room (1938) was about domestic disharmony, showcasing the man as the oppressor and the woman as the victim within a marriage, and was published by yet another publisher; this book also received good reviews. In 1937, Narayan's father died, and Narayan was forced to accept a commission from the government of Mysore [...] as he was not making any money.|$|E
500|$|Honeywood {{described}} Xenogears, {{his first}} translation project at Square {{and the first}} to be handled internally by the company, as [...] "pure hell". He stated that he started to change the company's approach to localization after that game, moving booths to always work very closely with the original development teams, improving communication with them, and introducing full-time editors. Woolsey, an English translator in the SNES era, also had a troublesome time while localizing Secret of Mana, which he said [...] "nearly killed [...] ". The translation was completed within a month of the Japanese release as Square wanted to catch the 1993 holiday season. Final Fantasy XIIIs localization, handled by Phil Bright and Tom Slattery, was also quite chaotic. According to Slattery, the lack of deadlines, poor communication and synchronization between the various departments, and continuing changes to the script and to cutscenes led to a turbulent development. Due to the script changes, large sections of dialogue needed to be re-translated and re-recorded by the English actors due to lack of necessary emotional drive for the scenes. In contrast, Alexander O Smith, who is often associated with the Ivalice games, had a good working relationship with Yasumi Matsuno during the localization of titles like Vagrant Story, Final Fantasy XII and the 2010 re-release of [...] The two worked closely to ensure that the English versions were faithful to Matsuno's vision. A challenging localization was Final Fantasy X, the first Final Fantasy title to feature voice acting. There, the team faced problems in both making the dialogue more compatible with an <b>English-speaking</b> <b>audience</b> and lip-synching it roughly with in-game characters, whose lip-movement was still for the original Japanese dialogue. The European releases of the same games did not feature localized voices but instead included the English voices. This trend lasted until Final Fantasy XIV, the first game to feature German, French, Chinese and Korean voices.|$|E

2500|$|... "A Lost Chapter From the Life of Oz" [...] (also in The Jewish Daily Forward) explores Amos Oz's 2005 memoir, A Tale of Love and Darkness.
