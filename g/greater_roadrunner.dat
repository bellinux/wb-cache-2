50|$|A {{variety of}} animals prey on {{hummingbirds}} given the opportunity. Due to their small size, hummingbirds are vulnerable even to passerine birds {{and other animals}} which generally feed on insects. On the other hand, only very swift predators can capture them and a free-flying adult hummingbird is too nimble for most predators. Chief among their predators are the smaller, swifter raptors like sharp-shinned hawks, merlins, American kestrels and Mississippi kites as well as domestic cats, loggerhead shrikes and even <b>greater</b> <b>roadrunners,</b> {{all of which are}} likely to ambush the hummingbird while it sits or sleeps on a perch or are distracted by breeding or foraging activities. Predatory lizards and bird-eating snakes may also prey on the species, especially on its tropical wintering grounds. Even large, predatory invertebrates have preyed on ruby-throated hummingbirds, including praying mantises (which have been seen to ambush adult hummingbirds at hummingbird feeders on more than one occasion), orb-weaver spiders, and green Darners. Blue jays are common predators of nests, as are several other corvids in addition to some icterids, bats, squirrels and chipmunks.|$|R
50|$|Rowdy (officially Rowdy the Roadrunner) is the mascot of the University of Texas at San Antonio Roadrunners.

5000|$|The {{resort is}} located in a {{semi-desert}} zone, surrounded by rock formations carved by water flow and geological pressures. [...] Exposed rock shows sedimentary layers that have folded. This and water erosion have created capricious forms that are all around this part of Hidalgo state. The high peaks in this area are often shrouded in mist. Cacti and semi-arid vegetation predominate in the hills above the canyon, with pine trees at the higher elevations. [...] The rugged peaks {{have a great deal of}} biological diversity. Among the plant species to be found are yucca (Yucca spp), mesquite (Prosopis spp.), tall cacti called ‚Äúviejitos‚Äù (little old ones) (Cephalocereus senilis), named so because their upper spines whiten and flatten, creating a grey-hair-like look, gumbo-limbos (Bursera simaruba), poinsettias (Euphorbia pulcherrima) as well as the abundant magueys that have been used for centuries to make pulque, a fermented beverage. Animals that can be seen include raccoons (Procyon lotor), <b>greater</b> <b>roadrunners</b> (Geococcyx californianus), hooded skunks (Mephitis macroura), white-nosed coatis (Nasua narica) and white-winged doves (Zenaida asiatica). Also, the area has been inhabited by various indigenous peoples such as the Otomi, the Mexica, the Toltecs and the Tepehua.|$|R
50|$|Wildlife {{observed}} in the park includes mule deer, rabbits, raccoons, armadillos, opossums, bobcats, porcupines and coyotes. <b>Roadrunners,</b> <b>great</b> blue herons, many species of ducks, meadowlarks, quail, doves, cardinals, owls, flickers, bluebirds, kites, hawks and mockingbirds {{are just a few}} of the many species of birds found in the park. Numerous frogs, turtles and lizards can be seen, as well as an occasional horned toad. Lake Copper Breaks is stocked with rainbow trout each winter.|$|R
50|$|Roadrunners {{inhabit the}} deserts of the southwestern United States, Mexico, and Central America. They live in arid lowland or mountainous shrubland, widely {{dispersed}} in dry open country with scattered brush. They are non-migratory, staying in their breeding area year-round. The <b>greater</b> <b>roadrunner</b> is not currently considered threatened in the US, but is habitat-limited.|$|E
50|$|The lesser {{roadrunner}} {{resembles the}} <b>greater</b> <b>roadrunner</b> (Geococcyx californianus) in appearance and habit but is smaller {{and has a}} significantly shorter bill. Its breeding range is in southwestern Mexico, and north into {{the western side of}} the Sierra Madre Occidental range; also northern Central America, and a disjunct range in the northern Yucat√°n Peninsula.|$|E
50|$|These {{birds are}} {{terrestrial}} and only fly occasionally. Both sexes are {{heavily involved in}} the nest building, incubating, and brooding process, though each alternates with primary responsibility of the tasks.

40|$|I {{conducted}} {{this study}} {{to better understand the}} <b>greater</b> <b>roadrunner?s</b> (Geococcyx californianus) spatial use, nest site selection, and sexual morphometrics. Data were first collected from a roadrunner population in Fisher County, Texas. I trapped, measured, and removed feathers for sex confirmation through DNA PCR analysis. I then fit the roadrunners with a radio transmitter and released them at the capture site. I captured a total of 10 birds (1 male and 9 females) and triangulated the location of each bird 2 - 4 times per week from February to August 2011 during the roadrunner nesting season. The data produced a mean minimum convex polygon nesting range of 43. 01 -ha, a 50 % core utilization distributions of 11. 88 -ha, and an overlap index of 33. 05 percent. Habitat selection ratios showed a preference for ridge as well as grassland habitat and avoidance of bare ground and flatland habitats. The location data from west Texas was further analyzed to build a predictive logistic regression model to understand the significant site characteristics in roadrunner land use during the nesting season. It was determined that percent rock (- 0. 12, P = 0. 0001) and percent litter (- 0. 05, P = 0. 0052) were the best predictors in determining actual from random locations. Rock references open area for hunting, transportation as well as ridge habitat. Litter alludes to region below dense stands of shrubs and is used by roadrunners for evasion from threats and as shade for thermoregulation. The measurements from the roadrunners in west Texas as well as museum specimens from across their natural range were combined to develop an easy, inexpensive, and field-relevant sex identification model. The strongest model consisted of bill depth (0. 79, P< 0. 0001) and bill tip {{to the back of the}} head (0. 05, P = 0. 1573) which were both found to be larger in males. The final portion of this study concerned roadrunner nest site selection. Data were collected in Wilbarger County, Texas from May 2006 to October 2009. A predictive logistic regression model of nesting locations determined that mesquite nesting tree (- 0. 89, P = 0. 0064), oval tree shape (1. 58, P = 0. 0118), mesquite density (- 0. 004, P = 0. 0080), and topographic edge (1. 37, P = 0. 0027) were the best predictors in determining actual nest sites from random locations...|$|R
