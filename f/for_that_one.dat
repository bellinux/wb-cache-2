The team played their home games at the Teaneck Armory <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> season, and was scheduled to play a one-game playoff at the armory. However, the circus had been booked for the week, and the game was relocated to a court in Commack, New York that was unplayable, and the game had to be forfeited. After the one season in Teaneck, the team relocated to Long Island and was renamed the New York Nets. Following the Long Island run, the Nets moved back to New Jersey in 1977 to be named as the New Jersey Nets until 2012 before they became the Brooklyn Nets.|$|E

25|$|The league {{suspended}} him, and his teammates, {{though not}} fond of Cobb, {{went on strike}} to protest the suspension, {{and the lack of}} protection of players from abusive fans, before the May 18 game in Philadelphia. <b>For</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> game, Detroit fielded a replacement team made up of hastily recruited college and sandlot players plus two Tiger coaches and (not surprisingly) lost, 24–2, thereby setting some of Major League Baseball's modern-era (post-1900) negative records, notably the 26 hits in a nine-inning game allowed by Allan Travers, who pitched one of the sport's most unlikely complete games. The pre-1901 record for the most hits and runs given up in a game is held by the Cleveland Blues' Dave Rowe. Primarily an outfielder, Rowe pitched a complete game on July 24, 1882, giving up 35 runs on 29 hits. The current post-1900 record for most hits in a nine-inning game is 31, set in 1992 by the Milwaukee Brewers against Toronto; however, the Blue Jays used six pitchers.|$|E

He was replaced on drums by Maureen Tucker, initially <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> show, but she soon became a full-time member with her pounding style of drumming {{an integral part of the}} band's distinctive sound, despite the initial objections of Cale. Though internally unstable (Cale left in 1968, Reed in 1970), and without commercial success, the band has a long-standing reputation as one of the most influential in rock history.|$|E

Martin got the inspiration for [...] "Grift of the Magi" [...] after reading a magazine article about how major companies were receiving permission to advertise their products in school students' textbooks. He thought it [...] "seemed like a gigantic conflict that could lead to big problems", and therefore believed an episode based on {{it would be a good}} idea. According to DVD Talk reviewer Adam Tyner, the episode is a satire of the commercialization of Christmas. A writer for Newsday has commented that episode skewers [...] "the annual craze <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> 'hot' toy." [...] This has also been pointed out by Mike Scully, who said in 2008 that [...] "Grift of the Magi" [...] was produced around the time when [...] "every year there seemed to be a hot toy.

[...] In response to Scully's comment, Martin added that every year [...] "the media would create this gigantic rush at the toy store for various things.

You don’t get the representation of what a real fire element looks like using software, but the guys at FuseFX, those FX animators are amazing. It takes a long time and a lot of set up to get things right.
