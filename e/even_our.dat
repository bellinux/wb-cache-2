5|$|The {{second section}} {{discusses}} disorder within nature, which is opposite {{to the discussion}} of order within nature found in the second section of Burnt Norton. Also, rational knowledge itself is described as being inadequate for explaining reality. Those who pursue only reason and science are ignorant. <b>Even</b> <b>our</b> progress is not progress {{as we continue to}} repeat the same errors as the past.|$|E
5|$|Counsel for the {{petitioner}} {{discussed at}} great length from a sociological point of view, of the age-old problem of the gambling instinct in the human being. According to his analysis, gambling pervades our entire economic system; thus insurance contracts are a gamble, stock and grain exchange transactions are gambles, and the farmer's dependence on weather is a gamble. Counsel's attempt to apply this analysis to the present case left us cold and unimpressed. He even reminded us that our great idol, Mr. Chief Justice John Marshall, in his day attended the horse races and wagered with his clergyman. In fact, they ran a book. As indicating how times have changed and how <b>even</b> <b>our</b> coarse nature has yielded to the protecting care of governmental policy, we confess we do not even know a bookmaker, clerical or otherwise, and our passes to the beautiful race tracks around Chicago lie in our desk unused.|$|E

We, therefore agree (that after timely warning, and receiving an adequate compensation for what little property they cannot take with them, they refuse to leave us in peace, as they found us—we agree to use such means as may be sufficient to remove them, and to that and we each pledge to each other are bodily powers, our lives, fortunes and sacred honors.|$|E

25|$|On further reflection, the Meditator {{realizes that}} even simple {{things can be}} doubted. Omnipotent God could make <b>even</b> <b>our</b> {{conception}} of mathematics false. One might argue that God is supremely good and would not lead him to believe falsely all these things. But by this reasoning we should think that God would not deceive him with regard to anything, and yet this is clearly not true. If we suppose there is no God, then there is even greater likelihood of being deceived, since our imperfect senses {{would not have been}} created by a perfect being.|$|E
25|$|Just as I {{was pushing}} {{one of our}} men back into the ranks I saw him fall at my feet from a sabre slash. I turned round instantly– to see English cavalry forcing their way into our midst and hacking us to pieces. Just as it is difficult, if not impossible, for the best cavalry to break into {{infantry}} who are formed into squares and who defend themselves with coolness and daring, so {{it is true that}} once the ranks have been penetrated, then resistance is useless and nothing remains for the cavalry to do but to slaughter at almost no risk to themselves. This what happened, in vain our poor fellows stood up and stretched out their arms; they could not reach far enough to bayonet these cavalrymen mounted on powerful horses, and the few shots fired in chaotic melee were just as fatal to our own men as to the English. And so we found ourselves defenceless against a relentless enemy who, in the intoxication of battle, sabred <b>even</b> <b>our</b> drummers and fifers without mercy.|$|E

Writing for The Times of India, Deepauk Murugesan said, [...] "There is no clear choice between options and while the audience is entirely aware of the right moral decision <b>even</b> <b>our</b> minds are clouded by our affections for both Dr Murali and Venu."

500|$|On June 9, the Emperor's confidant Marquis Kōichi Kido wrote a [...] "Draft Plan for Controlling the Crisis Situation," [...] {{warning that}} by the end of the year Japan's ability to wage modern war would be {{extinguished}} and the government would be unable to contain civil unrest. [...] "... We cannot be sure we will not share the fate of Germany and be reduced to adverse circumstances under which we will not attain <b>even</b> <b>our</b> supreme object of safeguarding the Imperial Household and preserving the national polity." [...] Kido proposed that the Emperor take action, by offering to end the war on [...] "very generous terms." [...] Kido proposed that Japan withdraw from the formerly European colonies it had occupied provided they were granted independence, that Japan disarm provided this not occur under Allied supervision, and that Japan for a time be [...] "content with minimum defense." [...] Kido's proposal did not contemplate Allied occupation of Japan, prosecution of war criminals or substantial change in Japan's system of government. With the Emperor's authorization, Kido approached several members of the Supreme Council, the [...] "Big Six." [...] Tōgō was very supportive. Suzuki and Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai, the Navy minister, were both cautiously supportive; each wondered what the other thought. General Korechika Anami, the Army minister, was ambivalent, insisting that diplomacy must wait until [...] "after the United States has sustained heavy losses" [...] in Operation Ketsugō.|$|E

2500|$|Another related {{issue is}} the pistis Christou ("faith of Christ") debate. Paul several times uses this phrase at key points in his {{writings}} and it is linguistically ambiguous {{as to whether it}} refers to our faith in Christ ("objective genitive"), or Christ's own faithfulness to God ("subjective genitive"), or <b>even</b> <b>our</b> faith/faithfulness to God like that which Christ had ("adjectival genitive").

The dumb parodies; the Wayne's World-inspired folklore about guitar shops demanding customers not play it; even Robert Plant's public disavowal of the song—all of these just prove the rule.

The predominant political theme was the uncompromising defence of a protective and efficient state, which favours secularism, prosperity and liberties. She also denounced the [...] "Europe of Brussels" [...] which [...] "everywhere imposed the destructive principles of ultra-liberalism and free trade, {{at the expense of}} public utilities, employment, social equity and <b>even</b> <b>our</b> economic growth which became within twenty years the weakest of the world".|$|E

2500|$|Radiohead {{initially}} did {{not want}} to reissue [...] "Creep" [...] in the United Kingdom, but relented; bassist Colin Greenwood said that [...] "after doing so well in America, there was this tremendous pressure from radio people, the press, the record company, <b>even</b> <b>our</b> fans, to put it out."
