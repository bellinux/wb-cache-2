25|$|I didn't {{have much}} time. July was half through, and <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a new forty-odd-person team assembled, trained, and {{deployed}} prior to Butler's arrival in Iraq on August 2. We {{would use the}} same basic inspection concept that had been prepared for July; the intelligence on both sites, I was assured by sources, was still valid but not for much longer. I would make use of some twenty-five inspectors resident in Baghdad with the monitoring groups, and I added twelve experts, {{selected on the basis}} of what the team needed for the planned inspection. I had a five-person command element fly to Bahrain with the twelve experts to train them. They were to stay in Bahrain after the training to carry out last-minute preparations and receive intelligence updates until they flew into Iraq on the same plane that would take Butler out on August 5. Somehow it all came together. The inspections would begin on the morning of the 6th.|$|E

[...] "You gotta understand that the taping of that; the Warfield show was two shows before my last show with the band. I haven't watched it because you kinda go back with your scene... for the fans, they see a show; for me, I see my second to last show with the band, you know what I mean? I have it but <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> some distance away from the situation and move on with my life. It's like breaking up with a girlfriend." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1988, Love aborted {{her acting}} career and left New York, {{returning}} to the West Coast, citing the [...] "celebutante" [...] fame she'd attained as the central reason. She returned to stripping {{in the small town}} of McMinnville, Oregon, where she was recognized by customers at the bar. This prompted Love to go into isolation, so she relocated to Anchorage, Alaska, where she lived for three months to [...] "gather her thoughts," [...] supporting herself by working at a strip club frequented by local fishermen. [...] "I decided to move to Alaska because <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> my shit together and learn how to work", she said in retrospect. [...] "So I went on this sort of vision quest. I got rid of all my earthly possessions. I had my bad little strip clothes and some big sweaters, and I moved into a trailer with a bunch of other strippers." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] {{was directed by}} Bryan Barber and choreographed by Jeri Slaugher. After seeing a trailer of Barber's film project, Idlewild, Aguilera {{wanted to make a}} video directed by him, explained: [...] "It intrigued me that this man, Bryan Barber, had been very locked into and had surrounded himself with this whole world of the '20s and '30s era, and it made me think that he could understand what I'm trying to do conceptually. <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the right director who shared my vision". At first Aguilera planned to make a black-and-white video and shot it in her living room for Barber and Slaugher. [...] "I had acted out the entire video in my living room. I used my fireplace as a makeshift stage and the staircase as the pool table where I would stand", said Aguilera. According to Barber, Aguilera was very involved in the making of the videot. The whole team seemed like they were doing a movie more than a music video. On June 21, 2006, the music video for [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] was premiered on MTV's Total Request Live.|$|E
500|$|After the {{dissolution}} of her band Tremblebee, Tove Lo focused on writing songs and she signed a publishing deal with Warner/Chappell Music in 2011. In the following year, she co-wrote [...] "Something New" [...] for Girls Aloud, and [...] "We Got the World" [...] and [...] "Ready for the Weekend" [...] for Icona Pop. After she signed the publishing deal, she felt [...] "lost" [...] and unsure of her identity. She was also going through a difficult time during a relationship, which led her to write songs that were not related to her life. However, at one point, she [...] "couldn't handle it anymore" [...] and needed to write a personal song. Lo then co-wrote [...] "Love Ballad" [...] with Ludvig Söderberg and Jakob Jerlström; it was their first collaboration. Söderberg and Jerlström also produced the track under their production name The Struts. According to Lo, an artist became interested in recording the song but considered it [...] "too brutal" [...] and wanted to change some of the lyrics. Because of this, Lo kept the song for herself. She said that after co-writing [...] "Love Ballad", she started to write songs [...] "that I felt <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of me".|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, Reznor {{successfully}} completed rehab, and eventually moved from New Orleans to Los Angeles. In a 2005 interview with Kerrang, he reflected on his self-destructive past: [...] "There was a persona that had run its course. <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> my priorities straight, my head screwed on. Instead of always working, I {{took a couple}} of years off, just to figure out who I was and working out if I wanted to keep doing this or not. I had become a terrible addict; <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> my shit together, figure out what had happened." [...] In contrast to his former suicidal tendencies, he admitted in another interview that he is [...] "pretty happy". Nine Inch Nails' next full-length album, With Teeth (2005), reached number one on the Billboard 200.|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, after {{pulling the}} band {{off the road}} mid-tour, Ward said he needed to re-group. [...] "I walked {{out in the middle}} of a tour.... <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away from {{everything}} and everyone. I wasn't enjoying myself at all, and I didn't feel my life or the band was where I wanted it to be... I needed to step back and reassess everything." [...] For two months, he retreated to his home without speaking to anyone in his professional life. In an article with PE.com, Ward said, [...] "When I left, I honestly didn't know if I was going to continue the band or not, so I told everyone to pursue whatever they wanted,". During that time, Hinojos left to join The Mars Volta as their new secondary guitarist and sound manipulator, filling the void left by Jeremy Ward's death. Hinojos was replaced by Keeley Davis.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the release}} of the Use Your Illusion albums, Stradlin had become {{dissatisfied}} with life in Guns N' Roses. He later recalled, [...] "Once I quit drugs, I couldn't help looking around and asking myself, 'Is this all there is?' I was just tired of it; <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out." [...] On November 7, 1991, it was announced that Stradlin had left Guns N' Roses. He had played his final show as an official member of the band on August 31 at Wembley Stadium. Of his reasons for leaving, Stradlin later said, [...] "I didn't like the complications that became such a part of daily life in Guns N' Roses," [...] citing the Riverport riot and Axl Rose's chronic lateness on the Use Your Illusion Tour as examples. He stated that getting sober played a part in his decision to leave, saying, [...] "When you're fucked up, you're more likely to put up with things you wouldn't normally put up with." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Keys {{won three}} NAACP Image Awards, {{including}} Outstanding Female Artist and Outstanding Song for [...] "Unbreakable".

She felt she needed to [...] "escape" [...] and went to Egypt for three weeks. She explained: [...] "That trip was definitely the most crucial thing I've ever done for myself {{in my life to}} date.

2500|$|Rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin {{abruptly}} {{quit the}} band on November 7, 1991, after {{a repeat of}} the St. Louis incident nearly unfolded during a concert in Germany. Stradlin cited a combination of Rose's personal behavior, his mismanagement of the band, and difficulties being around Slash, Sorum, and McKagan, due to his new-found sobriety and their continuing alcohol and substance addictions. Stradlin later commented, [...] "Once I quit drugs, I couldn't help looking around and asking myself, 'Is this all there is?' I was just tired of it; <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out." [...] Slash commented on finding a replacement, saying, [...] "When Izzy left, we realized that we either had to find a new guitarist in three weeks or cancel a bunch of gigs. I had a piece of paper with about 30-odd candidates listed. Duff was looking around and Axl had his ideas, but nobody seemed right. For a while it looked like Dave Navarro from Jane's Addiction was going to join, but he couldn't get it together, so that never happened." [...] Stradlin was eventually replaced by Los Angeles-based guitarist Gilby Clarke, whom Slash credited for saving the band.|$|E
2500|$|All of {{the songs}} that would feature on Wishful Thinking were written during the summer with {{almost all of them}} {{credited}} to Neck Deep. [...] "Crushing Grief (No Remedy)" [...] was credited to the band and Seb Barlow. Ben Barlow considered [...] "inspiration" [...] the hardest part of making the album due to him being [...] "super happy". Whereas for the band's EP releases Barlow [...] "had some shit going on that <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> off my chest". The band [...] "worked incredibly hard" [...] to make an album that reaches high standards set by other artists' albums that Hopeless have released. Rock Sound contributor Rob Sayce noted that the album was influenced by All Time Low's Nothing Personal (2009). Sayce wrote that the band [...] "gave British pop-punk a shot in the arm, drawing on the production sheen of 'Nothing Personal.'" [...] "Losing Teeth" [...] is about how Barlow and his friends were pursuing careers that would take them away from their hometown. Barlow said it wasn't [...] "about the end of our youth, as such, but definitely the end of us being kids, and reflecting on that." [...] "Growing Pains" [...] was the band's first attempt at [...] "diversity we have tried to implement", according to Thorpe-Evans. Thorpe-Evans mentioned that the group felt the song [...] "has a flair of originality and uniqueness" [...] when compared to the previous output. [...] "Candour" [...] was inspired by Barlow's dad, who was [...] "ill for a while." ...|$|E
2500|$|Under the {{pressure}} of matching [...] "Call Me Maybe"'s success, Jepsen recorded an entire indie-folk album during her run on Cinderella {{as an act of}} [...] "rebellion". The effort was scrapped as Jepsen felt like it was developed for the wrong reasons: [...] "I think there is a natural rebellion when you have success in one area to completely rebel against that. <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> that out of my system, I think. I made really weird music." [...] Her work on the musical provided valuable perspective in terms of being defined by a singular song, particularly from her costar Fran Drescher: [...] "Everyone still calls her 'the Nanny'. I realized you can't give in to other people's perception of you. Everyone's gonna be known for something."" [...] had to not be about trying to prove something. I feel like if you're writing music just to have a different identity in the public's eye, it's sort of the wrong motive. It's gotta be coming from a place of what you love and what you're passionate about."Jepsen sketched many of the album's demos on her tour bus while supporting Kiss, completing three by June 2013. Of these, [...] "Boy Problems" [...] would eventually finalize its form with Sia and Greg Kurstin. [...] "I Didn't Just Come Here to Dance" [...] existed as early as 2011 according to matching lyrics on a tweet authored by Jepsen. It would eventually be presented to Max Martin after the pair finished work on [...] "Tonight I'm Getting Over You" [...] in 2012; intending to cease their session at midnight, the song compelled Martin to stay for two extra hours. It was confirmed that she had worked with Josh Ramsay, Ryan Stewart, Benny Blanco and Stargate, though none of these producers appeared on the finalized project.|$|E
