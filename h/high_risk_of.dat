5|$|A gas {{explosion}} {{in a residential}} area of Rosario, the third-largest city in Argentina, occurred on August 6, 2013.

Several organizations helped secure the area, search for survivors and aid people who lost their homes.

5|$|Qeshm Island {{is part of}} the Simply Folded Belt, {{the most}} seismically active part of the Zagros fold and thrust belt. Similar to most {{earthquakes}} in the area, the 2005 event resulted from reverse slip faulting. Since it lies in such a seismically active area, there is a <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> destructive earthquakes in Iran; 1 in 3,000 deaths are attributable to earthquakes. One geophysicist has cited the lack of strict building codes as a serious concern.|$|E

5|$|A UTI affects {{parts of}} the urinary system {{including}} the urethra, bladder, and kidneys. There is about a one percent risk of UTIs in boys under two years of age, {{and the majority of}} incidents occur {{in the first year of}} life. There is good but not ideal evidence that circumcision of babies reduces the incidence of UTIs in boys under two years of age, and there is fair evidence that the reduction in incidence is by a factor of 310 times (100 circumcisions prevents one UTI). Prevention of UTIs does not justify routine use of the procedure, however. Circumcision is most likely to benefit boys who have a <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> UTIs due to anatomical defects, and may be used to treat recurrent UTIs.|$|E
5|$|A {{reversal}} agent for benzodiazepines exists, flumazenil (Anexate). Its {{use as an}} antidote is not routinely recommended because of the <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> resedation and seizures. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 326 people, 4 people had serious adverse events and 61% became resedated following the use of flumazenil. Numerous contraindications to its use exist. It is contraindicated in people {{with a history of}} long-term use of benzodiazepines, those having ingested a substance that lowers the seizure threshold or may cause an arrhythmia, and in those with abnormal vital signs. One study found that only 10% of the people presenting with a benzodiazepine overdose are suitable candidates for treatment with flumazenil.|$|E
5|$|After {{the mint}} closed, it {{performed}} {{a variety of}} functions for the Federal government. It was first downgraded to an assay office for the U.S. Treasury {{as it had been}} from 1876 to 1879. Then, in 1932, the assay office closed and the building was converted into a Federal prison, in which capacity it served until 1943. The Coast Guard then took over the building as a nominal storage facility, though in truth the structure was largely abandoned and left to decay until it was transferred to the state of Louisiana in 1965. During the Cold War, when many believed there to be a <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> nuclear war, the old Mint was considered to be the best fallout shelter in the city.|$|E

5|$|An {{entry level}} diver must learn the {{techniques}} of breathing underwater through a demand regulator, including clearing it of water and recovering it if dislodged from the mouth, and clearing the mask if it is flooded. These are critical survival skills, and if not competent the diver is at a <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> drowning. A related skill is sharing breathing gas with another diver, both as the donor and the recipient. This is usually done with a secondary demand valve carried for this purpose. Technical and professional divers will also {{learn how to use}} a backup gas supply carried in an independent scuba set, known as the emergency gas supply or bailout cylinder.|$|E
5|$|An {{exploding}} cigar is {{a variety}} of cigar that explodes shortly after being lit. Such cigars are normally packed with a minute chemical explosive charge near the lighting end or with a non-chemical device that ruptures the cigar when exposed to heat. The customary intended purpose of exploding cigars is {{as a form of}} hostile practical joke, rather than to cause lasting physical harm to the butt of the joke. Nevertheless, the <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> unintended injuries from their use caused a decline in their manufacture and sale.|$|E
5|$|Cancer {{screening}} uses {{medical tests}} to detect disease in {{large groups of}} people who have no symptoms. For individuals with <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> developing lung cancer, computed tomography (CT) screening can detect cancer and give a person options to respond to {{it in a way that}} prolongs life. This form of screening reduces the chance of death from lung cancer by an absolute amount of 0.3% (relative amount of 20%). High risk people are those age 55–74 who have smoked equivalent amount of a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years including time within the past 15 years.|$|E

5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is {{definitively}} diagnosed from tissue, i.e. it {{is proven}} by biopsy or examination of the tissue excised at surgery.

Considering it as the working diagnosis may be challenging in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC); such patients are at <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> developing cholangiocarcinoma, but the symptoms {{may be difficult to}} distinguish from those of PSC. Furthermore, in patients with PSC, such diagnostic clues as a visible mass on imaging or biliary ductal dilatation may not be evident.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{severe weather}} was ongoing {{at the start}} of April 27 and {{continued}} for the entire day virtually unbroken. For the second day in a row, the SPC issued a <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> severe weather for the Southern United States, and late that morning the SPC increased the probability for tornadoes to 45 percent along a corridor from Meridian, Mississippi, to Huntsville, Alabama, an extremely rare issuance exceeding the high risk standards.

The TSA detailed several of the measures, including a restriction on movement and access to personal items during the last hour of flight for planes entering U.S. airspace. The TSA also said that there would be more officers and security dogs at airports.|$|E
50|$|Some arrhythmias do {{not cause}} symptoms, {{and are not}} {{associated}} with increased mortality. However, some asymptomatic arrhythmias are associated with adverse events.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} whether overweight and obese individuals have higher reported fall and fall injury <b>risk</b> than individuals <b>of</b> healthy weight, {{and to examine}} the influence of BMI on health, {{quality of life and}} lifestyle characteristics of fallers. METHODS: A representative sample of community-based individuals aged 65 years and older in New South Wales was surveyed regarding their history of falls, height, weight, lifestyle and general health within a 12 -month period. RESULTS: Obese individuals had a 31 % <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> having fallen, but no <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> a fall-related injury compared to healthy-weight individuals. Obese fallers also had a 57 % <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> believing nothing could be done to prevent falls; a 41 % <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> using four or more medications; a 30 % <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> experiencing moderate or extreme pain or discomfort; were 26 % less likely have walked for two or more hours in the last week; and were less likely to think they were doing enough physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Older obese individuals have an increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> falls and obese fallers have a higher prevalence of pain and inactivity than fallers of a healthy weight. IMPLICATIONS: A decrease in sedentary lifestyle and regular weight-bearing exercise may reduce fall risk in older obese individuals. 6 page(s...|$|R
