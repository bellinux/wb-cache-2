5|$|The two {{go ahead}} with their plans to meet Alex, who brings along his friend, Junior (Chaddha) to the hotel. The group discuss their lives over supper, which is cut short by an {{argument}} between Alex and Sahil over the former's irresponsible behaviour. The four {{head back to the}} hotel room to collect Sahil's belongings, as Jai plans to leave later that night. Alex notices the guitar and later forces Sahil to play for him, to which Sahil obliges with an original song. Alex dances with Jai, who looks even more impressed with Sahil's artistry. Alex offers to take back Sahil's belongings and give the two some more time together. When he leaves, Sahil and Jai embrace, but <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> about anything that had happened.|$|E
25|$|The main Mosque in Lhasa {{was burned}} down by Tibetans and Chinese Hui Muslims were violently {{assaulted}} by Tibetan rioters in the 2008 Tibetan unrest. Tibetan exiles and foreign scholars like ignore and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> about sectarian violence between Tibetan Buddhists and Muslims. The majority of Tibetans viewed the wars against Iraq and Afghanistan after 9/11 positively {{and it had}} the effect of galvanizing anti-Muslim attitudes among Tibetans and resulted in an anti-Muslim boycott against Muslim owned businesses. Tibetan Buddhists propagate a false libel that Muslims cremate their Imams and use the ashes to convert Tibetans to Islam by making Tibetans inhale the ashes, even though the Tibetans seem to be aware that Muslims practice burial and not cremation since they frequently clash against proposed Muslim cemeteries in their area.|$|E

500|$|The allies {{decided to}} divide their forces into two armies: a {{multinational}} force {{that included the}} 1st Division and a second army composed entirely of Brazilians under Caxias. The 1st Division led by Marques de Sousa, along with Uruguayan and Argentine rebel troops, invaded Argentina. He found the long march to Buenos Aires, the Argentine capital, highly uncomfortable. He had spent his life {{up to that point}} fighting Hispanic-Americans, and he was now marching as their ally, surrounded by them. He did not trust them, and they trusted neither him nor his men. The only person among the allies with whom he shared his thoughts, and guardedly at that, was Domingo Faustino Sarmiento (later president of Argentina): [...] "We [...] form in here a separate group; we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> to anyone; no one approaches us and we could say that we walk among enemies." [...] On 3 February 1852, in the Battle of Caseros, they faced Rosas and his army. The allies were victorious, Rosas fled to the United Kingdom, and Marques de Sousa acquired his carriage as a war trophy.|$|E

500|$|Considered {{rare for}} Disney animals, Pascal and Maximus do not speak. The idea to make Pascal and Maximus mute was {{inspired}} by the performances of actors Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton in Silent films. Identifying themselves as [...] "huge fans" [...] of Chaplin, Greno and Howard suggested {{that it would be a}} good idea to have a character like the actor featured in the film. Additionally, the directors explained in an interview with Orange that Pascal and Maximus' silence was also inspired by the roles of Princess Aurora's animal friends in Disney's Sleeping Beauty (1959), following the film's rules and guidelines that even though they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk,</b> they remain [...] "very expressive" [...] nonetheless and [...] "act and understand without words." [...] Maximus particularly [...] "belongs to the grand tradition of Disney creatures that are full of personality even though they don't talk." [...] One film critic observed that Pascal and Maximus [...] "have personalities all their own, making use of techniques harkening back to the silent era". Howard explained that [...] "Pantomime acting is a great challenge for our animators" [...] because, according to animator Jin Kim, Pascal and Maximus both [...] "had to be funny without speech", forcing the animators to exaggerate their emotions and facial expressions. The Chicago Sun-Times observed that [...] "Pascal ... doesn't speak, but manages to convey himself with eye rolls and changes of color." [...] Both animals' sound effects are provided by American actor Frank Welker.|$|E
500|$|There are {{frequent}} references to Star Wars in 30 Rock, {{beginning with the}} pilot episode in 2006 where Tracy is seen shouting {{that he is a}} Jedi. Liz admits to being a huge fan of Star Wars, saying that she had watched it many times with Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), and dressed up as the Star Wars character Princess Leia during four recent Halloweens. There is also reference to Star Wars when Tracy takes on the identity of the character Chewbacca. In [...] "The Head and the Hair", Liz tells Jenna that [...] "The Head" [...] asked her out and says [...] "I had to say yes. I mean he looked at me with those handsome guys eyes. It was like the Death Star tractor beam when the Falcon was...", until Jenna interrupts her and says [...] "No Liz, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> about that stuff on your date. Guys like that do not like Star Trek", to which Liz corrects [...] "Wars!". Fey, a fan of Star Wars herself, said that the weekly Star Wars joke or reference [...] "started happening organically" [...] when the crew realized that they had a Star Wars reference [...] "in almost every show". Fey said that from then on [...] "it became a thing where [...] tried to keep it going", and that even though they could not include one in every episode, they still had a [...] "pretty high batting average". Fey attributed most of the references to executive producer and writer Robert Carlock, whom she described as [...] "the resident expert".|$|E

2500|$|Because of her investigative work, Mackenberg {{became an}} expert on the {{practices}} of fraudulent psychics. She claimed to have investigated over 1,000 mediums and never found one who was not a fraud. For example, the various mediums had claimed to communicate with over three dozen non-existent deceased husbands, despite Mackenberg being single. According to William Lindsay Gresham, [...] Julien Proskauer credited Mackenberg for [...] "much of his material" [...] in his book The Dead <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Talk.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s and early 1990s, {{advances}} in cognitive psychology and cognitive linguistics {{renewed interest in}} the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis. One of those who adopted a more Whorfian approach was George Lakoff. He argued that language is often used metaphorically and that languages use different cultural metaphors that reveal something about how speakers of that language think. For example, English employs conceptual metaphors likening time with money, so that time can be saved and spent and invested, whereas other languages <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> about time in that way. Other such metaphors are common to many languages because {{they are based on}} general human experience, for example, metaphors likening up with good and bad with down. Lakoff also argued that metaphor plays an important part in political debates such as the [...] "right to life" [...] or the [...] "right to choose"; or [...] "illegal aliens" [...] or [...] "undocumented workers".|$|E
2500|$|Penn Live {{reported}} {{a court order}} connected to this insurance coverage case involving Penn State stated that Paterno was allegedly told in 1976 about an accusation {{of child sexual abuse}} by Sandusky. The insurers, Pennsylvania Manufacturers' Association Insurance Company, alleged that a boy told Paterno he had been molested by Sandusky, who was an assistant coach then. The order also cited reports by unnamed assistant coaches who said they witnessed inappropriate contact between Sandusky and some children, according to the ruling by Philadelphia Judge Gary Glazer. Penn State spokesman Lawrence Lokman said university officials involved in cases related to the Sandusky scandal were aware of the new allegations contained in the insurance case broadly; Lokman said to Penn Live: [...] "Many, many people, potential victims and victims have come forward to the university as part of that (settlement) process... We <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> about their specific circumstances." [...] CNN reported one of the victims, identified as Victim A, had told Paterno about an incident in a bathroom after the victim was hitchhiking, as early as 1971.|$|E
2500|$|Rin, a {{girl whose}} arms were almost entirely {{deformed}} {{due to a}} birth defect, uses her feet to accomplish everyday tasks with surprising dexterity. She has short red hair and dark green eyes, and wears a boy's uniform to avoid the awkward situations that would arise from using her feet while wearing a skirt. Rin's unique personality has brought about awkward situations with her peers, especially for Hisao, and as a result, some people <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> with her such as Lilly. [...] She is nonchalant with the other students and about their disabilities in general; she usually inquiries about other people's disabilities as a hobby. As a result, she is seen as extremely blunt, especially with the mention of her period. She is Emi's friend and hall mate, as their physical abilities complement each other. Her role in the school festival is being the sole painter of a giant mural posted {{in front of the}} dorms. Her name was designed as both a homage to legendary cartoonist Osamu Tezuka as well as a pun based of her talent as an artist and disability (the first kanji in her surname means [...] "hand").|$|E
