Amended several times, the last substantive revisions were made in the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Expansion Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-382, Title II, August 20, 1990). This made trade benefits permanent (repealing the September 30, 1995 termination date). The law gives preferential trade and tax benefits for eligible Caribbean countries, including duty-free entry of <b>eligible</b> <b>products.</b> To be eligible, an article must be a product of a beneficiary country and imported directly from it, and at least 35% of its import value must have originated in one or more CBERA beneficiaries. Slightly different import value rules apply to articles entering from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The duty-free import of sugar and beef products is subject to a special eligibility requirement intended to ensure that increased production of sugar and beef will not adversely affect overall food production. Preferential tariff treatment does not extend to imports of: textiles and apparel subject to textile agreements, specified footwear, canned tuna, petroleum and its products, and watches or watch parts containing any material originating in countries denied normal trade relations (most-favored-nation) trade status.

NF 270 {{was found to}} be the most suitable for desalination of soy sauce due to its high permeate flux, though the rejection of amino nitrogen slightly decreased with increasing operation temperature. Soy sauce permeate was further concentrated to yield light-color soy sauce by Desal- 5 DK, another membrane with higher rejection of organic matter but lower permeate flux than those of NF 270. Glutamic acid and aspartic acid in soy sauce had highest retention by NF 270 while glycine passed through membrane most easily.

At the same time the Eu has signed trade preference agreements, particularly with Southern Mediterranean countries that are important suppliers of fruit and vegetables to the EU. The management of the import regime is a balance between two conflicting objectives: to support internal producers and to preserve trade flows from preferred countries. On the side of export subsidies, to handle the reduction commitments the EU has introduced their rationing trough tender procedures. The analysis shows that such subsidies do not seem able to boost exports of <b>eligible</b> <b>products.</b> Therefore EU policy makers should question the opportunity to continue to offer such subsidies...|$|E

The second chapter incorporates a model of endogenous corruption into an intra industry trade model. The purpose is to study how trade liberalization impacts bureaucratic corruption. We find that trade opening leads to tougher competition and thereby reduces the officials ability to extract rents from firms.

Our knowledge {{of the impact of}} specific trade facilitating programmes in the CA field is limited so far, making empirical studies of their trade impact desirable. This study investigates the impact of Supplier’s Declaration of Conformity (SDOC) on trade flows. As under SDOC regimes suppliers themselves provide written assurance of conformity to applicable technical regulations of a market, the costs of compliance are assumed to be smaller than for CA regimes requiring certification by third parties. The study focuses on three cases of SDOC introduction in the European Union covering <b>eligible</b> <b>products</b> from the medical devices, telecommunications equipment and machinery sectors. The paper explains the rationale for using SDOC, expected benefits and design characteristics of SDOC regimes. The quantitative analysis uses a gravity model and finds compelling evidence that the introduction of SDOC in the EU was a factor that influenced the evolution of import flows into EU markets positively. Intra-EU trade flows and imports from extra-EU OECD countries increased for SDOC-eligible radio and telecommunications equipment and low-risk medical devices, whereas the results for machinery are ambiguous. The most striking increases, visible in all three sectors, are found for exports to EU markets from non-OECD (developing) countries included in the sample.

40|$|Excerpt] The {{submission}} {{of this report}} to the Congress continues {{a series of reports}} by the U. S. Department of Labor on the impact o f the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) on U. S. employment. The current report covers calendar year 2003 and represents the eleventh in the series. The ATPA, enacted on December 4, 1991, authorized the President to proclaim duty-free treatment for eligible articles from Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, The ATPA expired on December 4, 2001, but was subsequently expanded in product coverage and renewed to December 31, 2006 by the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA) that was signed into law by the President on August 6, 2002. Section 207 of the ATPA directs the Secretary of Labor to undertake a continuing review and analysis {{of the impact of the}} agreement on U. S. employment and submit a summary report of such analysis annually to the Congress. During 2003, $ 1. 6 billion in U. S. imports from the beneficiary countries entered the United States duty-free under provisions in the ATPA; however, a significant portion of these duty-free entries (about 40 percent) probably would have qualified for duty-free entry under other existing U. S. trade preference programs such as the Generalized System of Preferences. In addition, $ 4. 2 billion in U. S. imports from the beneficiary countries benefited exclusively from the ATPDEA and entered the United States duty-free under its provisions for expanded product coverage. ATPA duty-free benefits in 2003 represented 14 percent of total U. S. imports from the beneficiary countries and only 0. 1 percent of total U. S. imports from all nations. ATPDEA duty-free benefits in 2003 accounted for 36 percent of total U. S. imports from the beneficiary countries, but only 0. 3 percent of total U. S. imports from all sources. Overall, U. S. imports from the beneficiary countries that benefited exclusively from the ATPA (on <b>eligible</b> <b>products</b> not eligible for GSP) and the ATPDEA (all covered products) amounted to $ 5. 2 billion in 2003, which represented about 45 percent of all U. S. imports from the beneficiary countries, but just 0. 4 percent of total U. S. imports from all sources. The main finding of this report is that preferential tariff treatment under the ATPA/ATPDEA has neither had an adverse impact on nor posed a significant threat to U. S. employment...|$|E
40|$|Study project (MBA) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2002. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The African Growth and Opportunity Act {{was signed}} into law in May 2000 to allow {{qualifying}} SSA countries to export <b>eligible</b> <b>products</b> duty free to the US. The act is a non-reciprocal "agreement" designed solely by the US, with the objective of promoting increased trade and investment between the US and SSA. The US insist that trade will lead to development on the African continent if SSA countries liberalise their markets and become integrated into the global economy. The theory behind trade liberalisation is that it promotes allocative efficiency by exploiting comparative advantage. I however argue that trade liberalisation can realise its potential only if the US start dismantling the protectionist barriers that have been described in this report. The AGOA does reduce tariff barriers for a number of African products. However new non-tariff barriers have been erected which are less transparent, but just as effective as tariff barriers. The report documents the significance of existing trade barriers that seek to protect the US industries from harm, and evaluates the problems that are created in spite of the intentions of the AGOA. A number of specific issues that will be significant for the future outcomes of the Act were also dealt with. These included: the anti-dumping steel duties, US Farm Bill, NEPAD and the textiles and apparel debate. The problems found with the AGOA included: • Protectionism that is sector specific, involving the cases of the antidumping steel duties and the Farm Bill. • The unfavourable terms of trade associated with the Act, caused by the non-negotiable, non-reciprocal and temporary nature of the AGOA. • The eligibility conditions of the Act, which serve to bind African countries to the rules of the World Trade Organisation and exclude some countries on the African continent from obtaining benefits. • Internal reform problems within the SSA countries involving government departments, infrastructure and the macroeconomic environment. The evidence over the short time since it was enacted reveals that the SSA countries will not gain much from the extended trade benefits of the AGOA, unless their capacity to produce and supply the US market is enhanced. Furthermore, most of the AGOA benefits have gone to oil exporting countries and SA, who is the only non-oil country benefiting from a number of sectors at present. The Act has failed to increase trade flows from eligible countries to the US, as most of the SSA countries are not at the economic development {{to take advantage of the}} preferences that have been provided under the AGOA. Furthermore the liberalisation of many of the African economies has not been reciprocated by the US. The actions of many interest groups in the US indicate that they are "yes" to free trade but "not" at the expense of jobs and profits. This is evident, as the AGOA provides no exceptions to any of the US retaliatory measures and the fact that interest groups in the US influence many of the product decisions when domestic market share is threatened. One of the positive outcomes of the AGOA is the joint US Africa Trade and Economic Co-operation Forum that will provide future avenues for beneficial US-Africa trade relations.

Two of the analytical methods involve radioisotope measurement by liquid scintillation counting (LSC) of samples prepared as 14 C carbamate or 14 C benzene. A third method uses accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) with graphite sample preparation. The Center for Applied Isotope Studies (CAIS) at the University of Georgia is unique in its analytical capabilities to perform onsite analyses of biobased products using all 3 methods.
