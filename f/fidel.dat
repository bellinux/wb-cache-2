5|$|After {{the success}} of the Cuban Revolution, led by <b>Fidel</b> Castro in 1959, almost all of Cuba's 15,000 Jews went into exile. The {{majority}} of them fled to Miami, Florida; however, Puerto Rico also received a large influx of Jewish emigres from Cuba.|$|E
5|$|Diplomatic {{relations}} between Cuba and the United States continued {{for some time}} after Batista's fall, but President Eisenhower deliberately left the capital to avoid meeting Cuba's young revolutionary leader <b>Fidel</b> Castro during the latter's trip to Washington in April, leaving Vice President Richard Nixon to conduct the meeting in his place. Cuba began negotiating arms purchases from the Eastern Bloc in March 1960.|$|E
5|$|From 1961 to 1968, UM leased {{buildings}} on its South Campus {{to serve as}} the covert headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency's JMWAVE operation against <b>Fidel</b> Castro's government in Cuba. In 1968, after Ramparts magazine exposed CIA operations on other campuses, JMWAVE was moved off the UM campus out of concern for embarrassing the university. The University no longer owns land at the south campus.|$|E
5|$|In Cuba, {{evacuations}} {{were ordered}} for Nueva Gerona on Isla de la Juventud, and for 113,754people on the mainland. Cattle {{were moved to}} a safe location for the storm's passage.

5|$|The {{early life}} of Cuban revolutionary and {{politician}} <b>Fidel</b> Castro, born Lina Castro, spans the first 26 {{years of his}} life, from 1926 to 1952. Born in Birán, Oriente Province, Castro was the illegitimate son of Ángel Castro y Argiz, a wealthy farmer and landowner, and his mistress Lina Ruz González. First educated by a tutor in Santiago de Cuba, <b>Fidel</b> Castro then attended two boarding schools before being sent to El Colegio de Belén, a school run by Jesuits in Havana. In 1945 he began studying law at the University of Havana, where he first became politically conscious, becoming a staunch anti-imperialist and critic of United States involvement in the Caribbean. Involved in student politics, he was affiliated to Eduardo Chibás and his Partido Ortodoxo, achieving publicity as a vocal critic of the pro-U.S. administration of President Ramón Grau and his Partido Auténtico.|$|E
5|$|After the Cuban Revolution of 1959, a {{representative}} of the <b>Fidel</b> Castro government asked Árbenz to come to Cuba, to which he readily agreed, sensing an opportunity to live with fewer restrictions on himself. He flew to Havana in July 1960, and, caught up {{in the spirit of the}} recent revolution, began to participate in public events. His presence so close to Guatemala once again increased the negative coverage he received in the Guatemalan press. He was offered the leadership of some revolutionary movements in Guatemala but refused, as he was pessimistic about the outcome.|$|E
5|$|After writing One Hundred Years of Solitude García Márquez {{returned}} to Europe, this time bringing along his family, {{to live in}} Barcelona, Spain, for seven years. The international recognition García Márquez earned {{with the publication of}} the novel led to his ability to act as a facilitator in several negotiations between the Colombian government and the guerrillas, including the former 19th of April Movement (M-19), and the current FARC and ELN organizations. The popularity of his writing also led to friendships with powerful leaders, including one with former Cuban president <b>Fidel</b> Castro, which has been analyzed in Gabo and Fidel: Portrait of a Friendship. It was during this time that he was punched in the face by Mario Vargas Llosa in what became one of the largest feuds in modern literature. In an interview with Claudia Dreifus in 1982 García Márquez notes his relationship with Castro is mostly based on literature: “Ours is an intellectual friendship. It may not be widely known that <b>Fidel</b> is a very cultured man. When we’re together, we talk a great deal about literature.” This relationship was criticized by Cuban exile writer Reinaldo Arenas, in his 1992 memoir Antes de que Anochezca (Before Night Falls).|$|E
5|$|Hosmer's father, Mike, is {{a retired}} firefighter, and his mother, Ileana, is a nurse. His mother was born in Cuba {{and came to the}} United States at the age of seven with her family to escape <b>Fidel</b> Castro's regime, growing up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His parents met in 1979 when Mike was {{assigned}} to duty at Coral Gables Hospital in Coral Gables, Florida, where Ileana worked. They married four years later. Their first son Mike Jr. was born in 1985, and Eric was born four years later in Miami.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, she was {{appointed}} {{a member of}} the Interim Batasang Pambansa (National Congress) representing Region IV-A. She was also appointed as Ambassador Plenipotentiary and Extraordinary, allowing her to tour the United States, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Cuba. Throughout her travels, she became friends with Richard Nixon, Muammar Gaddafi, Saddam Hussein, <b>Fidel</b> Castro, and Joseph Tito. She traveled to Iraq to secure oil and to Libya for a peace treaty with the Moro National Liberation Front.|$|E
5|$|In April 1961, a 1,400-man {{force of}} Cuban exiles invaded Cuba {{in an attempt}} to end the regime of <b>Fidel</b> Castro. The {{invasion}} was a failure and two hundred of the exiles were killed while an additional 1,200 were captured. Miskovsky, working with lawyer and lead negotiator James Donovan, and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, negotiated a release for the prisoners in return for around fifty million dollars in medicine, food and other supplies. The captured Cubans were released days before Christmas.|$|E
5|$|In May 2002, Payá {{presented}} NAPP with 11,020 signatures {{calling for}} a referendum on safeguarding {{freedom of speech and}} assembly, allowing private business ownership, and ending one-party rule. On 3 October 2003, he delivered an additional 14,000 signatures. Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter endorsed the petition when granted a chance to speak on Cuban television, bringing Payá's efforts to the attention of a wide Cuban audience. Cuban President <b>Fidel</b> Castro described the petition drive as a U.S.-backed conspiracy to overthrow his government.|$|E
5|$|In September 1960, at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City, MalcolmX {{was invited}} to the {{official}} functions of several African nations. He met Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, Ahmed Sékou Touré of Guinea, and Kenneth Kaunda of the Zambian African National Congress. <b>Fidel</b> Castro also attended the Assembly, and MalcolmX met publicly with him {{as part of a}} welcoming committee of Harlem community leaders. Castro was sufficiently impressed with MalcolmX to suggest a private meeting, and after two hours of talking, Castro invited MalcolmX to visit Cuba.|$|E
5|$|In a final {{flashback}} scene, Guevara is {{aboard the}} Granma in 1956, {{looking out over}} the ocean, as the Cuban Revolution is about to begin. He sees the Castro brothers alone at the bow of the ship; <b>Fidel</b> is talking and Raúl is taking notes. Guevara hands a peeled orange to one of his comrades and returns his gaze to the lone brothers before the scene fades to black.|$|E
5|$|In the Philippines, chief censor Henrietta Mendez ordered cuts {{of three}} scenes {{depicting}} sexual intercourse and female nudity before the movie could {{be shown in}} theaters. Spielberg refused, and pulled the film from screening in Philippine cinemas, which prompted the Senate to demand {{the abolition of the}} censorship board. President <b>Fidel</b> V. Ramos himself intervened, ruling that the movie could be shown uncut to anyone over the age of 15.|$|E
5|$|Morales is {{not married}} and upon {{becoming}} president selected his older sister, Esther Morales Ayma, {{to adopt the}} role of First Lady. He has three children from different mothers. They are Eva Liz Morales Alvarado (born 1994), Álvaro Morales Paredes (born 1995), and Ernesto <b>Fidel</b> Morales Zapata (born 2007 and allegedly died in infancy). Politician Juan del Granado is Eva Liz's godfather. Morales' romantic relationship with Ernesto's mother Gabriela Zapata Montaño, from 2005 to 2007, remained unknown publicly until 2016.|$|E
5|$|Morchella rufobrunnea, {{commonly}} known as the blushing morel, is a species of ascomycete fungus in the family Morchellaceae. A choice edible species, the fungus was originally described as new to science in 1998 by mycologists Gastón Guzmán and <b>Fidel</b> Tapia from collections made in Veracruz, Mexico. Its distribution was later revealed to be far more widespread after several DNA studies suggested that it is common in the West Coast of the United States, Israel, Australia, and Cyprus.|$|E
5|$|Most {{members of}} the Eskaya {{community}} inhabit a mountainous area that intersects the municipalities of Duero, Guindulman, Pilar, and Sierra Bullones in the once-forested region of Bohol's southeast interior. The original Eskaya settlement in Biabas (Guindulman), was established in 1902. In 1951, the second township of Taytay (municipality of Duero) was founded by Fabian Baja in accordance with Datahan's directions. Significant Eskaya populations are now {{also found in the}} nearby townships of Canta-ub, Lundag, Tambongan, Cadapdapan, and Fatimah. In 1996, the Eskaya community was awarded a certificate of Ancestral Domain Claim by President <b>Fidel</b> Ramos.|$|E
5|$|Orci {{was born}} in Mexico City on July 20, 1973, to a Mexican father and a Cuban mother. His mother immigrated to the United States with her parents after <b>Fidel</b> Castro came to power. Orci grew up in Mexico, and moved {{with his family to}} the United States at the age of 10. He was raised in Texas, Los Angeles and Canada. He is the older brother of screenwriter-producer J. R. Orci.|$|E
5|$|Political {{figures such}} as Arizona's United States Senators Jon Kyl and John McCain, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi issued statements. Numerous foreign {{politicians}} additionally commented on the shooting, including Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon, British Prime Minister David Cameron, Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, and Cuba's <b>Fidel</b> Castro. The website GiffordsIsLying.com, run by Giffords' former opponent Jesse Kelly, was replaced with a single page urging support for Giffords and her family.|$|E
5|$|The Cuban Revolution {{led to the}} {{overthrow}} of Fulgencio Batista, an ally of the United States, in 1959. <b>Fidel</b> Castro severed Cuba's formerly strong ties with the United States. The United States soon instituted a embargo against Cuba, which has made it illegal for United States corporations to enter into business with Cuba. The Baltimore Orioles, who were slated to hold an 1960 exhibition series against the Cincinnati Reds in Havana, moved the games to Miami, Florida.|$|E
5|$|The first {{large group}} of Jews to settle in Puerto Rico were {{refugees}} fleeing German–occupied Europe in the 1930s and 1940s. The second influx came in the 1950s, when thousands of Cuban Jews (most of Eastern-European descent) fled after <b>Fidel</b> Castro came to power. The majority immigrated to Miami, Florida, but a sizable portion chose to establish and integrate themselves on the neighboring island because of Puerto Rico's cultural, linguistic, racial, and historic similarities to Cuba.|$|E
5|$|After the indecisive {{results of}} the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale, <b>Fidel</b> Castro claimed that the {{increased}} cost of continuing to fight for South Africa had placed Cuba in its most aggressive combat position of the war, arguing that he was preparing to leave Angola with his opponents on the defensive. According to Cuba, the political, economical and technical cost to South Africa of maintaining its presence in Angola proved too much. Conversely, the South Africans believe that they indicated their resolve to the superpowers by preparing a nuclear test that ultimately forced the Cubans into a settlement.|$|E
5|$|Although far rarer {{than their}} prank cousins, {{exploding}} cigars {{used as a}} means to kill or attempt to kill targets in real life has been claimed, and is well represented as a fictional plot device. The most famous case concerning the intentionally deadly variety was an alleged plot by the CIA of the US in the 1960s to assassinate <b>Fidel</b> Castro. Notable real-life incidents involving the non-lethal ilk include an exploding cigar purportedly given by Ulysses S. Grant to an acquaintance and a dust-up between Turkish military officers and Ernest Hemingway after he pranked one of them with an exploding cigar.|$|E
5|$|Anarchism as {{a social}} {{movement}} in Cuba held great influence with the working classes during the 19th and early 20th century. The movement was particularly strong following {{the abolition of slavery}} in 1886, until it was repressed first in 1925 by President Gerardo Machado, and finally by <b>Fidel</b> Castro's Marxist–Leninist government following the Cuban Revolution in the late 1950s. Cuban anarchism mainly took the form of anarcho-collectivism based on the works of Mikhail Bakunin and, later, anarcho-syndicalism. The Latin American labor and by extension the Cuban labor movement itself was at first more influenced by anarchism than Marxism.|$|E
5|$|Aquino was {{succeeded by}} <b>Fidel</b> V. Ramos, {{who won the}} Philippine presidential {{election}} held in May 1992. During this period the country's economic performance remained modest, with a 5–7 percent GDP growth rate. However, the political stability and economic improvements, such as the peace agreement with the Moro National Liberation Front in 1996, were overshadowed by {{the onset of the}} 1997 Asian financial crisis. On his Presidency the death penalty was revived {{in the light of the}} Rape-slay case of Eileen Sarmienta and Allan Gomez in 1993 and the first person to be executed was Leo Echegaray in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Castro {{underwent}} surgery for intestinal bleeding, and on July 31, 2006, delegated his presidential duties to Raúl Castro. In February 2007, Raúl announced that Fidel's health was improving {{and that he}} was taking part in important issues of government. Later that month, <b>Fidel</b> called into Hugo Chávez's radio show Aló Presidente. On April 21, Castro met Wu Guanzheng of the Chinese Communist Party's Politburo, with Chávez visiting in August, and Morales in September. That month, the Non-Aligned Movement held its 14th Summit in Havana, there agreeing to appoint Castro as the organisation's president for a year's term.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War {{the future}} park area {{was used as}} a {{training}} ground for Cuban exiles training for missions in <b>Fidel</b> Castro's Cuba. Elliott Key in particular was used by the Central Intelligence Agency as a training area in the early 1960s in preparation for Bay of Pigs invasion. The largest facility was Ledbury Lodge, the only hotel ever built on the key. As late as 1988 a group of Cuban exiles were arrested when they tried to use the key for a mock landing. Farther north, exiled Venezuelan president Marcos Pérez Jiménez kept a house on Soldier Key until he was extradited in 1963.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, Sarmiento voluntarily left to Chile once again. During {{the same}} year, he met widow Benita Martínez Pastoriza, married her, and adopted her son, Domingo <b>Fidel,</b> or Dominguito, {{who would be}} killed in action during the War of the Triple Alliance at Curupaytí in 1866. Sarmiento {{continued}} to exercise the idea of {{freedom of the press}} and began two new periodicals entitled La Tribuna and La Crónica respectively, which strongly attacked Juan Manuel de Rosas. During this stay in Chile, Sarmiento's essays became more strongly opposed to Juan Manuel de Rosas. The Argentine government tried to have Sarmiento extradited from Chile to Argentina, but the Chilean government refused to hand him over.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner sought {{increased}} {{integration with}} other Latin American countries. He revived {{and tried to}} strengthen the Mercosur trade bloc and improved relations with Brazil, but without automatically aligning with that country, the regional power of South America. The president tried to keep a middle ground between Brazil and Venezuela, since he considered the Brazilian Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva too conservative, and the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez too anti-American. Kirchner worked with centre-left presidents Lula and Chilean Ricardo Lagos and the left-wing rulers Chávez, <b>Fidel</b> Castro from Cuba and Evo Morales from Bolivia. He established a political alliance with Chávez's government, and by 2008, Argentinian exports to Venezuela were quadruple what they were in 2002. A bilateral military commission was established with Venezuela, through which some technological exchange took place.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner {{took office}} as {{president}} of Argentina on 25 May 2003. Contrary to tradition, the ceremony {{was held at the}} Palace of the Argentine National Congress rather than Casa Rosada. He announced that he would spearhead change on many issues, from politics to culture. The ceremony was attended by the provincial governors, Supreme Court president Julio Nazareno, the heads of the armed forces, and Cuban leader <b>Fidel</b> Castro. Raúl Alfonsín was the only former president in attendance. Kirchner walked to the Casa Rosada along Avenida de Mayo, breaking with protocol to get close to the people, and was accidentally hit {{in the head with a}} camera.|$|E
5|$|Leaders of El Grito de Lares {{who were}} in exile in New York City joined the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee, founded on December 8, 1895 to {{continue}} the quest for independence. In 1897, {{with the aid of}} Antonio Mattei Lluberas and <b>Fidel</b> Velez, the local leaders of the independence movement of the town of Yauco, they organized another uprising, which became known as the Intentona de Yauco. On March 26, 1897, there was a second and last major attempt to overthrow the Spanish government. The local conservative political factions, which believed that such an attempt would be a threat to their struggle for autonomy, opposed such an action. Rumors of the planned event spread to the local Spanish authorities, who acted swiftly {{and put an end to}} what would be the last major uprising in the island to Spanish colonial rule.|$|E
