50|$|A real <b>estate</b> <b>derivative</b> is a {{financial}} instrument whose value {{is based on}} the price of real estate. The core uses for real <b>estate</b> <b>derivatives</b> are: hedging positions, pre-investing assets and re-allocating a portfolio. The major products within real <b>estate</b> <b>derivatives</b> are: swaps, futures contracts, options (calls and puts) and structured products. Each of these products can use a different real estate index. Further, each property type and region {{can be used as a}} reference point for any real <b>estate</b> <b>derivative.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{market for}} real <b>estate</b> <b>derivatives</b> was long overdue. Real <b>Estate</b> {{is the only}} major asset class that only {{recently}} developed a derivatives market. According to the Pension Real Estate Association’s Plan Sponsor Research Report, pension funds allocate approximately 6.0% of their assets to real estate, {{making it one of}} the largest investable asset classes, after equities and fixed income. Because of the significant transactions costs involved with investing in real <b>estate,</b> <b>derivatives</b> can improve the efficiency of the market.|$|R
40|$|All major asset classes {{including}} {{stocks and}} bonds have a well developed derivative market. Derivatives enable counterparties to reflect a view on a particular market, without having to trade the underlying asset. This {{seems to be a}} particularly appealing feature for real estate, an industry characterized by high transaction cost, long lead transaction time and lack of short-selling mechanism. Still, real estate remains the last major asset class without a liquid derivative market until recently when Credit Suisse began to offer swaps on the NCREIF Property Index (NPI) in the U. S. early this year following the UK's ten-year endeavor in developing real <b>estate</b> <b>derivative</b> market. The purpose of this thesis is two fold. First, in chapter one and two, we would like to explain what real <b>estate</b> <b>derivatives</b> are, how they work and why they can be beneficial to investors. Second, we are introducing some practical tools investors may use in evaluating and trading real <b>estate</b> <b>derivatives.</b> In chapter three, we are introducing three forecasting models on the NCREIF Property Index. In chapter four, we are expanding Prof. David Geltner's pricing methods on real estate index capital return swap to the NPI total return swap and property type total return swap. (cont.) These pricing methods present a basic foundation for investors to price all three types of swap currently being offered by Credit Suisse. In our study, we find that derivatives can provide numerous benefits to real estate investors including low transaction cost, quick execution and short-selling mechanism. These benefits in turn can help investors implement various strategies including hedging against market risk, asset allocation, sector rebalancing, international diversification and portable Alpha. Our research on UK's experience in real <b>estate</b> <b>derivatives</b> as well as our investor survey results in the U. S. and the UK lead us to believe that further initiative and pioneering efforts are critical {{for the development of the}} real <b>estate</b> <b>derivatives</b> market. By presenting this study on index forecasting models and pricing methodologies, we hope to increase the awareness and comfort level of investors and thus encourage the proliferation of real <b>estate</b> <b>derivatives.</b> by Jong Yoon Lim and Yi Zhang.

In the last chapter, the paper presents Pure Property, a current real estate hedging solution, marketed by NAREIT and FTSE. We research Pure Property and compare it to past products. The paper points on Pure Property's new concept and its implications on asset valuation, product functionality and trading liquidity.

40|$|Commercial {{real estate}} is an {{important}} asset class {{but it does not}} yet have a well-developed derivatives market in the United States. A derivative is a contract that derives its value from an underlying index or asset. Examples of the most well-known derivatives that have been widely used and traded for years are stock options, commodity futures and interest rate swaps. The advent of direct real <b>estate</b> equity <b>derivative</b> products has created the opportunity for similar applications in both the US and international commercial real estate markets. The United States is currently experiencing a convergence between real estate and finance and it appears that the real <b>estate</b> <b>derivatives</b> market might be ready to take off. The use of derivatives could improve the functioning of the real estate industry by allowing investors to gain or reduce exposure to the commercial real estate asset class without directly buying or selling properties. The increased liquidity and reduced up front capital requirements provide added flexibility in executing real estate investment strategies (i. e. speculating) and managing risk (i. e. hedging). This has resulted in significant interest in the development of commercial property derivatives by key players in all sectors. A number of barriers (e. g., indices, pricing, education, fund mandates, tax and accounting treatment) still exist that hinder the successful implementation and growth of real <b>estate</b> <b>derivatives</b> in the US commercial real estate market. It is crucial for the market to overcome these barriers in order to revolutionize the institutional world and allow investors to gain exposure to the real estate asset class and to hedge private real estate risk. This thesis analyzes these barriers {{to the development of a}} synthetic market that is on the brink of expanding. (cont.) The US real estate sector is an eight trillion dollar market composed of real estate assets which has been managed until recently without pointed focus on the property specific risk. The size of this market presents a vast opportunity for risk hedging, asset allocation and portfolio rebalancing in a more efficient manner through the use of derivatives. by Jani Venter. Thesis (S.

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of residential real estate as both an asset class for investors and {{as a source of}} "housing services" for individual home owners, as well as the relatively high volatility in house prices, markets for derivative instruments to hedge these risks have been slow to develop. The numerous problems include developing a satisfactory price index upon which derivative contracts could be written, given extensive heterogeneity in the underlying housing stock, sluggish adjustment of prices in a market marked by great illiquidity, strong seasonality in supply and demand, and of course, the fact that dynamic arbitrage between a real <b>estate</b> <b>derivative</b> and the underlying is not feasible. The authors begin with an "efficient market process" for the true value of the index and construct a "real estate index process," eventually ending up with closed-form valuation equations for forwards, swaps, and options on the index.

Bench or separate front seating was offered, with three-speed column-change gearbox or the optional four-speed floor change. A 'Powerglide' two-speed automatic transmission was also available. Another US feature was that the optional radio was incorporated into the bright-metal dashboard trim.

The benefits of knowing the shape of the subjective ex ante return distributions is that it may help developers and investors make better decisions and negotiate specific terms with each contributor in the capital structure.

40|$|Long-term investment, {{the cost}} of capital and the {{dividend}} and buyback puzzle by Adrian Blundell-Wignall and Caroline Roulet * The paper argues that interest rates are at extremely low levels to support banks, {{and the search for}} yield has pushed the liquidity driven speculative bubble from real <b>estate,</b> <b>derivatives</b> and structured products markets into the corporate debt market. Equities have rallied strongly too. This asset cycle is certainly helping banks reduce hidden losses on illiquid securities and could also help reduce {{the cost of}} equity. But for this to occur at current bond yields would require an unrealistic bubble in equities. Markets are assuming that this transition from low to higher rates (more in line with nominal GDP) can be handled smoothly by policy makers, when in fact this may not be so. Extreme volatility would risk new financial fragility problems. The paper presents a panel model using more than 4, 000 global companies and shows that the Capex decision in general depend on the cost of equity, the accelerator and uncertainty, whereas buybacks are driven mainly by the gap between the cost of equity and debt. Right now the incentive structure implied by very low interest rates, which may be sustained for a long time, together with tax incentives, works directly against long-term investment. Debt finance is cheap, while the cost of equity capital needed for risky long-term investment is still high. This combination provides a direct incentive for borrowing to carry out buybacks (de-equitisation). Noting that weak investment reduces potential GDP, the paper makes some policy suggestions...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{address the issue of}} the {{robustness}} of the price level, mean, and variance estimates for two sets of repeat sales real estate price indices: the classical WRS method and a PCA factorial method, as elaborated in Baroni, Barthélémy and Mokrane (2007). Our work can be seen as an extension of Clapham, Englund, Quigley and Redfearn (2006), with the aim of helping to judge of the efficiency of such indices in designing real <b>estate</b> <b>derivatives</b> contracts. We use an extensive repeat sales database for the Paris (France) residential market. We describe the dataset used and compute the parameters (drift and volatility) of the indices produced over the period 1982 - 2005. The aim here is to test the sensitivity of these two indices to revision due to additional repeat-sales transactions information. Our analysis is conducted on the global Paris market and on submarkets. Our main conclusion is that the revision problem may cause serious concern for the stability of key parameters that are used as inputs in the pricing of derivatives contracts. The impact of index revision is important on the estimate of the index price level. This result is consistent with the finding of the existing literature for the US and Swedish markets. We also find that although the revision impact on the trend estimate can be important, the WRS method seems more robust and derivatives contracts such as swaps may be based on such indices. Finally, and this is probably the most promising result, revision influence on volatility estimates seems to be less stringent, and according to the robustness of the volatility estimate, the BBM factorial index seems to fare relatively better than the WRS index. Hence, we find that the factorial index could better sustain volatility based derivatives such as call or put options. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{why and how}} publicly-traded {{home builders}} might use index-based residential property derivatives to manage risk. After describing a number of alternative reasons for hedging, I argue for a paradigm for risk management proposed by Kenneth Froot, David Scharfstein and Jeremy Stein and augmented by Antonio Mello and John Parsons. According to this paradigm, the objective of hedging is to increase a firm's financial flexibility by maximizing its liquidity - slack {{in the form of}} cash or unused debt capacity - when falling output prices reduce income and make it difficult to raise external financing, but do not reduce the firm's need for funds. An important implication of this paradigm is that attempting to eliminate volatility in the value of a firm is not an optimal hedging objective, and attempting to do so can, in fact, reduce the value of the firm. To illustrate how this paradigm might be used by public home builders it is applied to two hypothetical firms, each with a different capital structure and regional focus, and the potential benefits of hedging for each firm is discussed. The discussion then turns to the available real <b>estate</b> <b>derivative</b> products and how they can be employed as hedging vehicles. Key issues pertaining to the design of hedging vehicles are examined, including 1) how to choose a derivative contract, 2) how to choose an index or indices to use as the asset underlying the hedging vehicle and 3) how to address misalignment between the time to expiration of available derivatives contracts and the development time frames of residential communities. Evidence is presented that suggests hedging vehicles based on multi-market composite indices will probably have too much basis risk to effectively hedge against downturns in the prices of some builders' homes.

40|$|Insurance {{companies}} offer business and individuals {{the possibility to}} reduce the financial impact of a risk occurring by transferring it away from themselves onto someone. For taking on risk on behalf of someone else the insurance company requires a premium from the policyholder which is pooled and invested {{in order to meet}} future obligations towards the policyholder. However, the importance of the European insurance industry goes beyond economic protection of the policyholder as the industry with its EUR 8. 4 trillion or 58 percent of EU GDP in assets is the largest institutional investor in Europe. As the financial system has undergone dramatic transformation over time, so have the role and function of intermediaries changed. While traditional tasks like reducing transaction costs and asymmetric information became less relevant, facilitating of risk transfer and dealing with the increasing breadth and depth of financial markets are gaining more and more importance. While insurers have been able to hold illiquid asset to a larger extent arguments from the industry are made that the planned introduction of Solvency II will limit insurers and overlook their investment abilities, which is something that can affect the region’s economic development. The above mention aspect combined with the limited research that has been conducted on insurers’ asset allocation and the performance of it resulted in the following research question: Does asset allocation impact insurance company's performance? The question focuses on insurers within the European Union (EU) which is enlarged by the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland, where performance is measured as the return on investment (ROI). To answer the research question in the best possible way, relevant theories such as Modern Portfolio Theory or Efficient Market Hypothesis are presented and discussed as well as previous research on asset allocation. Earlier studies about asset allocation policy and its power to explain the investment return came to different conclusions which can be due to variation in the interpretation of the findings or difficulties by distinguishing between asset allocation policy and active asset allocation. Census is used to investigate in the topic as the population of listed insurance companies within the selected region was rather small which finally came down to 42 firms due to the timeframe of 11 years. Data regarding insurer’s asset class weights in debt securities, equity, real <b>estate,</b> <b>derivatives,</b> cash and equivalent, loans and receivables and the category of others were collected. The return on investment was also collected for each year of the time period and for each insurance company. Benchmarks were constructed in order to replicate what the return of a passive investment of the same proportion would have yielded. The result was inconclusive as {{it was not possible to}} determine if asset allocation policy or active management have the greatest impact on the return on investment. This is contradicting previous research of asset allocation and performance as researchers have found that asset allocation policy explains most or all of the return...|$|R

5000|$|For {{legislators and}} {{committees}} responsible for financial reform related to derivatives in the United States and elsewhere, distinguishing between hedging and speculative derivatives activities {{has been a}} nontrivial challenge. The distinction is critical because regulation should help to isolate and curtail speculation with derivatives, especially for [...] "systemically significant" [...] institutions whose default could {{be large enough to}} threaten the entire financial system. At the same time, the legislation should allow for responsible parties to hedge risk without unduly tying up working capital as collateral that firms may better employ elsewhere in their operations and investment. [...] In this regard, it is important to distinguish between financial (e.g. banks) and non-financial end-users of <b>derivatives</b> (e.g. real <b>estate</b> development companies) because these firms' derivatives usage is inherently different. More importantly, the reasonable collateral that secures these different counterparties can be very different. The distinction between these firms is not always straight forward (e.g. hedge funds or even some private equity firms do not neatly fit either category). Finally, even financial users must be differentiated, as 'large' banks may classified as [...] "systemically significant" [...] whose derivatives activities must be more tightly monitored and restricted than those of smaller, local and regional banks.|$|R
