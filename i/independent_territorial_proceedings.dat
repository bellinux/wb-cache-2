40|$|This {{thesis is}} written {{from a private}} {{international}} law {{point of view and}} applies a conflicts analysis to cross-border insolvencies. A comparative approach is adopted. The jurisdictions chosen are Belgium and England and Wales. Belgian law was chosen because it {{is a good example of}} a radical adherence to the principles of unity and universality. In the light of this theoretical starting point a single set of proceedings is preferred and ancillary or <b>territorial</b> <b>proceedings</b> in any form are virtually impossible. English law, whilst accepting the universality principle, rejects the unity principle. This leads to a very different approach, with plenty of space for ancillary proceedings. The two legal systems are therefore highly suitable for a comparative analysis with the aim to discover whether existing national systems of private international law are capable of dealing effectively and efficiently with ever increasingly complex cross-border insolvencies.;The analysis of the two legal systems involved leads to the clear conclusion that each system has its advantages, but that nevertheless neither of them is able to deal with cross-border insolvencies on its own.;In a second stage the thesis therefore analysis transnational initiatives that could address this problem. The EU Regulation and the UNCITRAL Model Law have been chosen because the first one will enter into force in 2002 and because the latter one has a good chance of being implemented. Both initiatives come as packages and all their provisions are therefore analysed.;At the end of this analysis the clear conclusion is that national systems can no longer cover things alone. Ideally measures such as those contained in the Regulation should be adopted globally, as a starting point. Since that may not yet be possible, the slightly weaker alternative in the Model Law can be a good starting point. This is clearly an area in full evolution...|$|R

2500|$|Portuguese ground defences were {{organised}} as the Land Forces of the State of India (FTEI, Forças Terrestres do Estado da Índia), {{under the}} Portuguese Army's <b>Independent</b> <b>Territorial</b> Command of India, headed by Brigadier António José Martins Leitão. At {{the time of}} the invasion, they consisted of a total of 3,995 men, including 810 native (Indo-Portugueses – Indo-Portuguese) soldiers, many of whom had little military training and were utilised primarily for security and anti-extremist operations. These forces were divided amongst the three Portuguese enclaves in India. The Portuguese Army units in Goa included four motorised reconnaissance squadrons, eight rifle companies (caçadores), two artillery batteries and an engineer detachment. In addition to the military forces, the Portuguese defences counted with the civil internal security forces of the Portuguese India. These included the State of India Police (PEI, Polícia do Estado da Índia), [...] general police corps modelled after the Portuguese Public Security Police; the Fiscal Guard (Guarda Fiscal), responsible of the Customs enforcement and border protection; and the Rural Guard (Guarda Rural), game wardens. In 1958, as an emergency measure, the Portuguese Government gave a provisional military status to PEI and the Fiscal Guard, placing them under the command of the FAEI. The security forces were also divided amongst the three districts and were mostly made up of Indo-Portuguese policemen and guards. Different sources indicate between 900 and 1400 men as the total effective for these forces, at {{the time of the}} invasion.|$|R
