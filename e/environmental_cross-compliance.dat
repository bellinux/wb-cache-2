The focus is on farmers' response to this policy {{taking into account the}} uneven distribution of information between farmers and public administration, and the compliance monitoring problem. The main factors affecting farmers' behaviour are analysed to show the impact of their choices on compliance costs, program management costs and net benefits stemming from this policy. Finally, some policy design strategies are analysed to show how these differ in terms of policy objectives, benefits, costs and policy management strategies.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{recent changes}} in EU agricultural policy and its implementation in Ireland and asks whether the changes made encourage a more sustainable agriculture in Ireland {{in line with the}} objectives of the Rio UN Conference on the Environment and Development. It argues that the Agenda 2000 reforms of the CAP common market regimes will have only a modest environmental impact. The extension of horizontal <b>environmental</b> <b>cross-compliance</b> in determining eligibility to receive direct payments will have a potentially larger impact, but carries the danger that it may legitimise current compensatory payments as payments for environmental services provided by farmers, even though the standard of farming required is only good farming practice. The implementation of the EU’s agrienvironment scheme in Ireland is also evaluated, and it is argued that the focus of the scheme should be shifted more from avoiding pollution to habitat protection and creatio n. 1 An earlier version of this paper was presented to the Conference “Achievement and Challenge- Rio+ 10 an...|$|E

There is {{a growing}} awareness in present-day society of the potential of sustainable farming systems to enhance wildlife and the landscape and to decrease environmental harm caused by farming practices. EU commitment to integrate environmental considerations into agricultural political agenda {{has resulted in the}} adoption of <b>environmental</b> <b>cross-compliance</b> and agri-environment support schemes. Sustainability can only be achieved through multi-objective policy tools. Furthermore, more insight is needed into the environmental-economic tradeoffs of farming systems to direct policy interventions towards sustainable development of rural areas. The main objective of the present research is to provide an environmental-economic framework for the design and evaluation of agricultural policy schemes aimed at the operationalisation of sustainability in agricultural areas. The research involved designing and applying (1) an environmental accounting information system (EAIS), and (2) an integrated ecological-economic model to evaluate sustainability of farming systems. First, the EAIS together with a set of economic indicators was applied to three case study farms representing organic, integrated and conventional farming systems. Results showed that organic farming systems have the potential to improve the efficiency of many environmental indicators in addition to being remunerative. Environmental performances of all farming systems analysed were consistently affected by pedo-climatic factors on a regional as well as on a site scale. Subsequently, the EAIS indicators were integrated with farm records from one of the case studies and were used as a data source for the construction of an integrated ecological-economic model. The model was first used to evaluate the impact of current (Agenda 2000) and previous (MacSharry reform) agro-environment regimes on sustainability of organic farming systems. Then, the model was used to analyse the impact of Agenda 2000 common market organisation and agri-environment schemes on conventional and organic farming systems. Results indicated that the level of sustainability achieved with organic farming was satisfactory under both the MacSharry reform and the Agenda 2000 regulations. Optimising the model under different policy scenarios confirmed that organic farming systems are environmentally more beneficial than conventional farming systems. Combining the model with sensitivity and scenario analyses enabled an evaluation of the opportunity costs incurred by farmers to supply environmental amenities. Finally, the use of such information to back policy decisions is discussed...|$|E
40|$|An Economic Assessment of the June 2003 Common Agricultural Policy Reform. The main {{innovation}} of the June 2003 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) {{reform is}} to replace most market aids {{by a single}} direct payment per farm disconnected from production choices and levels (decoupling process), conditional on the respect of statutory environmental, food safety, animal health and animal welfare standards as well as good agronomic and <b>environmental</b> practices (<b>cross-compliance</b> process). This decoupled payment will be progressively reduced up {{to a maximum of}} 5 % and funds saved through this modulation mechanism will be switched from the first pillar of the CAP to a consolidated and strengthened rural development regulation confirmed as the second pillar of the CAP. In application of the subsidiary principle, important degrees of freedom are given to Member States in terms of market aids which would remained coupled and in defining cross-compliance national criteria. The objectives of this paper are the following. In a first stage, it presents the reform and proposes a qualitative analysis of measures adopted in June 2003. In a second stage, it provides a quantitative assessment of the reform for the European agricultural sector: impacts on supply, demand, exports and imports, prices, agricultural incomes, budget costs and welfare. In a third stage, the same exercise performed at the French scale allows us to give first responses to some interrogations raised by the decoupling of the income support policy. Attention is focused on three issues, i. e., land abandonment, extensification and the process of specialisation of farms and regions. We conclude by presenting our point of view on necessary evolutions of the CAP. ce est utilisé pour apporter une première réponse à certaines interrogations que pose le découplage. L'attention est centrée sur les questions d'abandon de terres, d'extensification et de spécialisation productive des exploitations et des régions. En conclusion, nous présentons quelques pistes souhaitables d'évolution de la PAC. Butault Jean-Pierre, Gohin Alexandre, Guyomard Hervé, Barkaoui Ahmed.
