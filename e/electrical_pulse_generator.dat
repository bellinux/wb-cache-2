50|$|Deep brain {{stimulation}} (DBS) {{has shown}} benefits for movement {{disorders such as}} Parkinson's disease, tremor and dystonia and affective disorders such as depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, chronic pain and cluster headache. Since DBS can directly change the brain activity in a controlled manner, {{it is used to}} map fundamental mechanisms of brain functions along with neuroimaging methods. A simple DBS system consists of two different parts. First, tiny microelectrodes are implanted in the brain to deliver stimulation pulses to the tissue. Second, an <b>electrical</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>generator</b> (PG) generates stimulation pulses, which is connected to the electrodes via microwires.Physiological properties of the brain tissue, which may change with disease state, stimulation parameters, which include amplitude and temporal characteristics, and the geometric configuration of the electrode and the surrounding tissue are all parameters on which DBS of both the normal and the diseased brain depend on. In spite of a huge amount of studies on DBS, its mechanism of action is still not well understood.Developing DBS microelectrodes is still challenging.|$|E
50|$|Spinal cord {{stimulation}} (SCS) is {{an effective}} therapy {{for the treatment of}} chronic and intractable pain including diabetic neuropathy, failed back surgery syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome, phantom limb pain, ischemic limb pain, refractory unilateral limb pain syndrome, postherpetic neuralgia and acute herpes zoster pain. Another pain condition that is a potential candidate for SCS treatment is Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, which is associated with moderate to severe chronic extremity pain. SCS therapy consists of the electrical stimulation of the spinal cord to 'mask' pain. The gate theory proposed in 1965 by Melzack and Wall provided a theoretical construct to attempt SCS as a clinical treatment for chronic pain. This theory postulates that activation of large diameter, myelinated primary afferent fibers suppresses the response of dorsal horn neurons to input from small, unmyelinated primary afferents.A simple SCS system consists of three different parts. First, microelectrodes are implanted in the epidural space to deliver stimulation pulses to the tissue. Second, an <b>electrical</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>generator</b> implanted in the lower abdominal area or gluteal region while is connected to the electrodes via wires, and third a remote control to adjust the stimulus parameters such as pulse width and pulse rate in the PG. Improvements have been made in both the clinical aspects of SCS such as transition from subdural placement of contacts to epidural placement, which reduces the risk and morbidity of SCS implantation, and also technical aspects of SCS such as improving percutaneous leads, and fully implantable multi-channel stimulators. However, there are many parameters that need to be optimized including number of implanted contacts, contact size and spacing, and electrical sources for stimulation. The stimulus pulse width and pulse rate are important parameters that need to be adjusted in SCS, which are typically 400 us and 8-200 Hz respectively.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{the area}} of bioelectromagnetic studies {{there is a growing}} {{interest}} to understand the mechanisms leading to nanosecond electric fields induced electroporation. Real-time imaging techniques at molecular level could probably bring further advances on how electric fields interact with living cells. However the investigations are limited by the present-day lack of these kinds of advanced instrumentations. In this context, we present an innovative electro-optical pump-probe system. The aim of our project is to provide a performing and compact device for electrical stimulation and multiplex Coherent anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (M-CARS) imaging of biological cells at once. The system consists of a 1064 nm sub-nanosecond laser source providing both a monochromatic pump and a polychromatic Stokes optical beam used in a CARS process, as well as the trigger beam for the optoelectronic switching-based <b>electrical</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>generator.</b> The polychromatic Stokes beam (from 600 to 1700 nm) results from a supercontinuum generation in a photonic crystal fiber (PCF). A detailed spectro-temporal characterization of such a broadband spectrum shows the impact of the nonlinear propagation in the fiber on the Stokes wave. Despite the temporal distortions observable on Stokes pulse profiles, their spectral synchronization with the pump pulse remains possible and efficient in the interesting region between 1100 nm and 1700 nm. The electrical stimulation device consists of a customized generator combining microstrip-line technology and laser-triggered photoconductive semiconductor switches. Our experimental characterization highlights the capability for such a generator to control the main pulse parameters (profile, amplitude and duration) and to be easily synchronized with the imaging system. We finally test and calibrate the system by means of a KDP crystal. The preliminary results suggest that this electro-optical system provides a suitable tool for real-time investigation of bioelectromagnetic interactions in the nanosecond and sub-nanosecond regime...|$|E
40|$|The {{bandwidth}} {{of frequency}} domain measurement methods of electrical signals has usually been {{far greater than}} the bandwidth of time domain methods. The primary limits of the time domain approach have been the 20 to 30 GHz bandwidth limit for electronic waveform acquisition instrumentation, {{and the lack of}} usable <b>electrical</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>generators</b> for excitation of a test device. The bandwidth of frequency domain network analysis appears to have reached a plateau of between 100 to 200 GHz, while time domain measurement have improved markedly in both bandwidth and sensitivity with the introduction of the pulsed laser based electro-optic sampling approach. Network analysis or the measurement of device scattering parameters provides information necessary to the design of electronic network such as high frequency amplifiers, mixers, and phase shifter. The bandwidth of frequency domain network analysis is currently being exceeded by the next generations of high frequency transistors and devices. Thus the electro-optic approach is a natural means of extending network analysis into the range above 100 GHz by employing time domain methods. In this approach, a suitable <b>electrical</b> excitation <b>pulse</b> is generated and propagated along a transmission line toward a test device. In the picosecond domain, laser driven photoconductive switches provide a unique method of generating electrical transients.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{work performed}} at the National Physical Laboratory to improve the electrical risetime calibration of instruments such as fast sampling oscilloscopes. The majority of the work {{can be divided into}} four sections: development of an ultrafast optoelectronic pulse generator; measurement of fast <b>electrical</b> <b>pulses</b> with an electrooptic sampling system; de-embedding of transmission line and transition effects as measured at different calibration reference planes; and calibration of an oscilloscope. The <b>pulse</b> <b>generator</b> is a photoconductive switch based on low-temperature Gallium Arsenide, which has a very fast carrier recombination time. Sub-picosecond <b>electrical</b> <b>pulses</b> are produced by illuminated a planar switch with 200 fs optical pulses from a Ti: sapphire laser system. The pulses are measured using a sampling system with an external electro-optic probe in close proximity to the switch. The electro-optic sampling system, with a temporal resolution better than 500 fs, is used to measure the <b>electrical</b> <b>pulses</b> shape at various positions along the planar transmission line. The results are compared to a pulse propagation model for the line. The effects of different switch geometries are examined. Although the <b>pulse</b> <b>generator</b> produces sub-picosecond <b>pulses</b> near to the point of generation, the pulse is shown to broaden to 7 ps after passing along a length of transmission line and a coplanar-coaxial transition. For a sampling oscilloscope with a coaxial input connector, this effect is significant. Frequency-domain measurements with a network analyser, further electro-optic sampling measurements, and the transmission line model are combined to find the network transfer function of the transition. Using the <b>pulse</b> <b>generator,</b> the electro-optic sampling system and the transition knowledge, a 50 GHz sampling oscilloscope is calibrated.
