2500|$|In mathematics, in {{particular}} in algebraic topology and differential geometry, the Stiefel–Whitney classes are a set of topological invariants of a real vector bundle that describe the obstructions to constructing everywhere independent sets of sections of the vector bundle. Stiefel–Whitney classes are indexed from 0 to n, where n is the dimension of the vector space fiber of the vector bundle. If the Stiefel–Whitney class of <b>index</b> <b>i</b> is nonzero, then there cannot exist (n'i+1) everywhere linearly independent sections of the vector bundle. A nonzero nth Stiefel–Whitney class indicates that every section of the bundle must vanish at some point. [...] A nonzero first Stiefel–Whitney class indicates that the vector bundle is not orientable. [...] For example, the first Stiefel–Whitney class of the Möbius strip, as a line bundle over the circle, is not zero, whereas the first Stiefel–Whitney class of the trivial line bundle over the circle, S1R is zero.|$|E
