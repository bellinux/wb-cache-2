40|$|Nowadays, {{a popular}} method used for {{additive}} watermarking is wide spread spectrum. It consists in adding a spread signal into the host document. This signal is {{obtained by the}} sum {{of a set of}} carrier vectors, which are modulated by the bits to be embedded. To extract these embedded bits, weighted correlations between the watermarked document and the carriers are computed. Unfortunately, even without any attack, the obtained set of bits can be corrupted due to the interference with the host signal (host interference) and also due to the interference with the others carriers (<b>inter-symbols</b> <b>interference</b> (ISI) due to the non-orthogonality of the carriers). Some recent watermarking algorithms deal with host interference using side informed methods, but <b>inter-symbols</b> <b>interference</b> problem is still open. In this paper, we deal with interference cancellation methods, and we propose to consider ISI as side information and to integrate it into the host signal. This leads to a great improvement of extraction performance in term of signal-to-noise ratio and/or watermark robustness. Comment: 12 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

50|$|The {{transmission}} {{processing of}} SC-FDMA {{is very similar}} to that of OFDMA. For each user, the sequence of bits transmitted is mapped to a complex constellation of symbols (BPSK, QPSK or M-Quadrature amplitude modulation). Then different transmitters (users) are assigned different Fourier coefficients. This assignment is carried out in the mapping and demapping blocks. The receiver side includes one demapping block, one IDFT block, and one detection block for each user signal to be received. Just like in OFDM, guard intervals (called cyclic prefixes) with cyclic repetition are introduced between blocks of symbols in view to efficiently eliminate <b>inter-symbol</b> <b>interference</b> from time spreading (caused by multi-path propagation) among the blocks.|$|E
50|$|Since {{different}} frequency {{components of}} the signal are affected independently, {{it is highly unlikely}} that all parts of the signal will be simultaneously affected by a deep fade. Certain modulation schemes such as orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and code division multiple access (CDMA) are well-suited to employing frequency diversity to provide robustness to fading. OFDM divides the wideband signal into many slowly modulated narrowband subcarriers, each exposed to flat fading rather than frequency selective fading. This can be combated by means of error coding, simple equalization or adaptive bit loading. <b>Inter-symbol</b> <b>interference</b> is avoided by introducing a guard interval between the symbols.

40|$|Abstract: Conventional OFDM {{transmission}} system uses a fixed-length Cyclic Prefix to counteract <b>Inter-Symbol</b> <b>Interferences</b> (ISI) caused by channel delay spreading under wireless mobile environment. This may cause considerable performance deterioration when the CP length {{is less than}} the channel RMS delay spread, or may decrease the system power and spectrum efficiency when it is much larger. A novel Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) transmission scheme is proposed in this paper to adapt the CP length to the variation of channel delay spread. AOFDM-VCPL utilizes the preamble or pilot sub-carriers of each OFDM packet to estimate the channel RMS delay spread; and then uses a criterion to calculate the CP length, which finally affects the OFDM transmitter. As illustrated in the simulation section, by deploying this scheme in a typical wireless environment, the system can transmit at data rate 11. 5 Mb/s higher than conventional non-adaptive system while gaining a 0. 65 dB power saving at the same BER performance...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis work {{is about}} {{reducing}} energy {{consumption in the}} receiver chain by limiting {{the use of the}} equalizer. It is to make the radio receiver aware of its environment and able to take decision to turn on or off the equalizer according to its necessity or not. When the equalizer is off, the computational complexity is reduced and the rate of reduction depends on the percentage of time during which this component is disabled. In order to achieve this scenario of adapting the use of the equalizer, we need to develop a decision making technique that provides to the receiver the capacities of awareness and adaptability to the state of its environment. For this, we improve a technique based on a statistical modeling of the environment by defining two metrics as channel quality indicators to evaluate the effect of the <b>inter-symbol</b> <b>interferences</b> and the channel fading.

40|$|Abstract—Given the {{emphasis}} on increasing wireless network usage for healthcare application, e. g., Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN), the need for high-rate physical layer has become a genuine concern from research and industrial community. The use of the Ultra-Wideband (UWB) is looking especially bright for such systems given its lower energy consumption and performances towards frequency-selective channels. However, the Multi-Band-OFDM-based UWB technique has some inherent limitations as loss in spectral efficiency due {{to the use of}} Cyclic-Prefix (CP). In this paper, a new physical layer scheme for high-rate wireless body area networks based on MB-OFDM with Offset Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (OQAM) modulation is presented. The proposed MB-OFDM/OQAM can achieve high spectral and power efficiency than conventional MB-OFDM system. Moreover, the use of the CP Interval in the conventional MBOFDM removes efficiently the <b>Inter-Symbols</b> <b>Interferences</b> (ISI) but remains ineffective towards the Inter-Carriers Interferences (ICI) caused by the channel frequency offset (FO). The performances evaluation of the proposed technique will be carried-out in realistic UWB-WBANs channels with various scenarios, which will be also presented and studied herein. 1...|$|R

30|$|Multicarrier (MC) {{modulation}} has various {{advantages that}} make it useful {{for a wide variety}} of digital communication systems [1]. Actually, it has been chosen as the physical layer standard for a diversity of basic systems such as digital transmission over telephone lines, applications in broadcasting, and in wireless networks [2 – 6]. The most important advantage of the MC system is its robustness against interferences. In fact, cyclic prefix (CP) insertion through MC symbols provides higher immunity against channel delay spread. Therefore, as long as channel dispersion is not longer than the CP, system performance does not degrade. However, a highly time-dispersive channel leads to a significant reduction of the transmission data rate since the received signal is corrupted by both inter-carrier and <b>inter-symbol</b> <b>interferences.</b> To avoid such a performance degradation, a channel-shortening technique, commonly referred to as time-domain equalizer (TEQ), is introduced at the receiver front end. Generally, the TEQ is defined as a transversal filter with the main purpose of keeping the delay spread of the combined channel-plus-equalizer impulse response (IR) not longer than the CP length [7]. Yet, by being finite IR (FIR) filters, all of the proposed TEQs are designed for both FIR and/or infinite IR (IIR) channel shortening which make all of them solve the channel-shortening problems without taking into account the transmission channel models.|$|R
