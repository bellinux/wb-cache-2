5|$|Hutchinson's husband William died {{some time}} after June 1641 {{at the age of}} 55, the same age at which Anne's <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>died.</b> He was buried in Portsmouth. No record of his death exists because there was no {{established}} church, which would have been the customary repository for such records.|$|E
5|$|The {{ceremonial}} {{first pitch}} {{was thrown out}} by George Brett. Matt Harvey started Game 1 for the Mets, while Edinson Vólquez started for the Royals. Vólquez's <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>died</b> earlier in the day. He {{was not aware of}} his father's death until after he left the game.|$|E

5|$|Leonardo did {{not stay}} in Milan for long because his <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>died</b> in 1504, and in 1507 {{he was back}} in Florence trying to sort out {{problems}} with his brothers over his father's estate. By 1508 Leonardo was back in Milan, living in his own house in Porta Orientale in the parish of Santa Babila.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} his death has been debated. Napoleon's physician, François Carlo Antommarchi, led the autopsy, which found {{the cause of death}} to be stomach cancer. Antommarchi did not sign the {{official}} report. Napoleon's <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>died</b> of stomach cancer, although this was seemingly unknown {{at the time of the}} autopsy. Antommarchi found evidence of a stomach ulcer; this was the most convenient explanation for the British, who wanted to avoid criticism over their care of Napoleon.|$|E
5|$|Daghlian was {{estimated}} to have received a dose of 510rem (5.1Sv) of neutron radiation, from a yield of 1016 fissions. Despite intensive medical care, he developed symptoms of severe radiation poisoning and his mother and sister were flown out to care for him (his <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>died</b> in 1943). He fell into a coma, and died 25 days after the accident. He was the first known fatality caused by a criticality accident. His body was returned to New London, where he was buried in Cedar Grove Cemetery.|$|E
50|$|His <b>father</b> <b>having</b> <b>died</b> in 1697, it was {{arranged}} {{that the family}} living of Langford Magna {{should be given to}} Arthur {{as soon as he was}} old enough.|$|R

5|$|Following the war, White {{returned}} to Romney. Since his <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>died,</b> {{he became the}} family patriarch and resumed practicing law to support them. In 1865, he entered into a practice with John Jeremiah Jacob until Jacob began his tenure as Governor of West Virginia in 1871. White then expanded his law practice and it became the largest {{of its kind in}} the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia. He continued his law practice until 1877, when he became Attorney General of West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|In 1004-5 al-Maʿarri {{learned that}} his <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>died</b> and, in reaction, wrote an elegy where he praised his father. Years later he would travel to Baghdad where he became well {{received}} in the literary salons of the time, {{though he was a}} controversial figure. After the eighteen months in Baghdad, al-Maʿarri returned home for unknown reasons. He may have returned because his mother was ill, or he may have run out of money in Baghdad, as he refused to sell his works. He returned to his native town of Maʿarra in about 1010 and {{learned that his}} mother had died before his arrival.|$|E
5|$|In November 1978, Armstrong {{was working}} at his farm near Lebanon, Ohio. As he jumped off {{of the back of}} his grain truck, his wedding ring got caught in the wheel, tearing off the tip of his left hand's ring finger. He {{collected}} the severed digit and packed it in ice, and surgeons reattached it at the Jewish Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky. In February 1991, a year after his <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>died,</b> and nine months {{after the death of his}} mother, he suffered a mild heart attack while skiing with friends at Aspen, Colorado.|$|E
50|$|Hon. Coplestone John de Grey Warwick Bampfylde (1914-1936), {{only son}} and heir apparent, {{an officer in}} the Royal Horseguards, who predeceased his <b>father,</b> <b>having</b> <b>died</b> aged 23 in a horse-racing accident.|$|R
50|$|Her {{daughter}} Alfreda married Robert Lydston Newman in October 1899 at St George's Church, Hanover Square, London, England. Her brother George gave Alfreda away (her <b>father</b> <b>having</b> <b>died</b> {{earlier that}} year).|$|R
50|$|In July 1918 Simon {{receives}} word in France {{that his}} <b>father</b> <b>has</b> <b>died</b> {{in a hospital}} in Memphis; in due time, {{after the end of}} the war, Simon returns to the U.S.|$|R
5|$|On 19 August AD 14, Augustus {{died while}} visiting Nola where his <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>died.</b> Both Tacitus and Cassius Dio wrote that Livia {{was rumored to}} have brought about Augustus' death by {{poisoning}} fresh figs. This element features in many modern works of historical fiction pertaining to Augustus' life, but some historians view it {{as likely to have}} been a salacious fabrication made by those who had favoured Postumus as heir, or other of Tiberius' political enemies. Livia had long been the target of similar rumors of poisoning on the behalf of her son, most or all of which are unlikely to have been true.|$|E
5|$|On May 16, 1954, Garcia {{pitched a}} one-hitter against the Philadelphia Athletics in a 6–0 Indians win. Garcia {{called it the}} finest game of his career. He was {{selected}} for his third and final All-Star Game when American League manager Casey Stengel added him, Lemon, and Doby to an American League roster that already featured Avila and top vote-getter Al Rosen. During a late July exhibition game, Garcia learned that his <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>died</b> {{at the age of}} 65; Garcia's son Michael was born the same day. He missed several games that year with a broken blood vessel in his throwing hand, but he managed 45 appearances on the season.|$|E
5|$|Promoted to {{the rank}} of Warrant Officer during his tenure as a {{prisoner}} of war, Brooks was informed upon his arrival that his <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>died</b> in May of the previous year. He returned to Canada in June. He was awarded the Military Cross for his actions during the conflict, as well several other campaign and achievement medals such as the 1967 Canadian Centennial Medal and the silver Polish Cross of Merit with Swords. He was one of only five RCAF members to receive the Military Cross during World War II (as it is primarily granted to soldiers serving in Army units) and his citation was the longest.|$|E
50|$|Time passes as Andi keeps Clare {{locked up}} in his home as his prisoner. When he finds out his <b>father</b> <b>has</b> <b>died</b> in his sleep, Andi remains in his father's house for a few days, {{wandering}} around depressed, while Clare is left to her own devices, with the power in the apartment off. Unable to escape, she takes polaroids of herself and eats {{what is left of}} the food until Andi finally returns a week later and he tells her his <b>father</b> <b>has</b> <b>died.</b> Clare, who appears to exhibit stockholm syndrome, appears relieved as she thought {{he was not going to}} come back.|$|R
25|$|Music {{was already}} {{important}} {{to him as a}} solace, as he was orphaned at the age of ten – his <b>father</b> <b>having</b> <b>died</b> in 1921 from injuries received in World War I and his mother <b>having</b> <b>died</b> four years later.|$|R
50|$|Also in 1800 Ingham {{returned}} to Pennsylvania {{and established a}} paper mill on his mother's farm (his <b>father</b> <b>having</b> <b>died</b> in 1793) that would be his main source of employment in the coming years.|$|R
5|$|The film's {{theme of}} {{reconciliation}} between a dying {{father and his}} son had special significance for Burton, as his <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>died</b> in 2000 and his mother in 2002, a month before he signed on to direct. Big Fish was shot on location in Alabama {{in a series of}} fairy tale vignettes evoking the tone of a Southern Gothic fantasy. The film received award nominations in multiple film categories, including four Golden Globe Award nominations, seven nominations from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, two Saturn Award nominations, and an Oscar and a Grammy Award nomination for Danny Elfman's original score.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later, the Emperor {{received}} word that his <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>died</b> on 10 March 1826, {{and that he}} had succeeded his father on the Portuguese throne as King Dom PedroIV. Aware that a reunion of Brazil and Portugal would be unacceptable to the people of both nations, he hastily abdicated the crown of Portugal on 2 May in favor of his eldest daughter, who became Queen Dona MariaII. His abdication was conditional: Portugal was required to accept the Constitution which he had drafted and MariaII was to marry his brother Miguel. Regardless of the abdication, PedroI continued to act as an absentee king of Portugal and interceded in its diplomatic matters, as well as in internal affairs, such as making appointments. He found it difficult, at the very least, to keep his position as Brazilian emperor separate from his obligations to protect his daughter's interests in Portugal.|$|E
5|$|According to Josiffe's account, a {{homosexual}} liaison with Thorpe began that same evening, at Thorpe's mother's home in Oxted, and continued for several years. Thorpe, while acknowledging that a friendship developed, denied any sexual dimension in the relationship. He organised accommodation for Josiffe in London, and a longer-term {{stay with a}} family in Barnstaple, within the North Devon constituency. He paid for advertisements in Country Life magazine, {{in an effort to}} find work with horses for his friend, arranged various temporary jobs, and promised to help Josiffe to realise an ambition to study dressage in France. On the basis of Josiffe's claim that his <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>died</b> in an air crash, Thorpe's solicitors investigated whether any money was due, but found that Albert Josiffe was alive and well in Orpington.|$|E
50|$|Villains: In some versions, {{her father}} plays {{an active role}} in the humiliation of his daughter; in others, he is {{secondary}} to his new wife, Cinderella's stepmother; in some versions, especially the popular Disney film, Cinderella's <b>father</b> <b>has</b> <b>died</b> and Cinderella's mother <b>has</b> <b>died</b> also.|$|R

50|$|The {{second son}} of John Hampden Gurney, {{he was a}} brother of Edmund Gurney the psychic researcher. His <b>father</b> <b>having</b> <b>died</b> in 1862, the five {{children}} were brought up by Russell and Emelia Gurney, their uncle and aunt.|$|R
5|$|Al-Hajj Muhammad was {{initially}} educated in Dhinnaba's kuttab, a traditional elementary school. In 1899–1900 he {{was enrolled in}} a primary school in Tulkarm. Later, he would work the fields of his lands alongside his father and occasionally traveled with him from place to place, selling their agricultural products. During World War I (1914–18) he was conscripted into the Ottoman army (a requirement for male Ottoman citizens), posted outside of Palestine in Tripoli and Beirut. He returned following the Ottomans' defeat by British forces and their Hashemite Arab allies. His <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>died</b> sometime during the war. In 1920 Britain, which had already been in control of the area, established a mandate over Palestine {{under the auspices of the}} League of Nations.|$|E
5|$|Archibald, 5th Earl of Rosebery, born in 1847, had {{inherited}} his title from his grandfather in 1868, when aged 21, {{together with an}} income of £30,000 a year. He owned 40,000acres (160km²) in Scotland, and land in Norfolk, Hertfordshire, and Kent. His <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>died</b> when he was eight {{and he had been}} brought up by his mother, who had subsequently married Harry Powlett, 4th Duke of Cleveland. His mother was a distant figure, and their relationship was always strained. The Earls of Rosebery, whose family name was Primrose, were old, if undistinguished, members of the Scottish aristocracy. Rosebery was considered to be strikingly handsome and immensely cultivated. He was highly intelligent, and a brilliant future was forecast for him by his tutors at both Eton and Christ Church, Oxford.|$|E
5|$|Beresford visited several {{schools and}} auditioned many {{children}} {{for the role of}} Sonny before he came across Allan Hubbard in Paris, Texas. Beresford said Hubbard, like Harper, was chosen based on a simple, rural quality he possessed. The boy was able to relate easily to the character because, like Sonny, his father died at an early age; later, some media reports falsely claimed that his father was killed during the Vietnam War, just as Sonny's was in the film's backstory. None of the filmmakers knew Hubbard's <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>died</b> until after filming began. Duvall developed a strong, trusting relationship with Hubbard, which Foote felt improved the duo's on-screen chemistry. Hubbard would often play guitar with Duvall during breaks from filming.|$|E
50|$|Henri was a posthumous child, his <b>father</b> <b>having</b> <b>died</b> {{nearly six}} months before his birth. He {{therefore}} became Prince of Condé within weeks of his birth, {{as soon as he}} was recognized and confirmed by the king of France.|$|R
