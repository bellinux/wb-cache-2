25|$|One change we did {{not need}} to make as part of this {{interchange}} was to complement. We say that complement is a self-dual operation. The identity or <b>do-nothing</b> <b>operation</b> x (copy the input to the output) is also self-dual. A more complicated example of a self-dual operation is (x∧y) ∨ (y∧z) ∨ (z∧x). There is no self-dual binary operation that depends on both its arguments. A composition of self-dual operations is a self-dual operation. For example, if f(x, y, z) = (x∧y) ∨ (y∧z) ∨ (z∧x), then f(f(x, y, z), x, t) is a self-dual operation of four arguments x,y,z,t.|$|E
5000|$|The ':' colon {{character}} is a shell builtin that has similar effect to a [...] "NOP" [...] (a <b>do-nothing</b> <b>operation).</b> It's not technically an NOP, as it changes the special parameter $? (exit status of last command) to 0. It may be considered a synonym for the shell builtin 'true', and its exit status is true (0).|$|E
