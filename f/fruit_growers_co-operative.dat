50|$|After 1906, gold {{production}} declined and by 1925 {{the last}} of the big mines had ceased operations. Agriculture and dairying had begun to emerge as key industries within the Gympie district and in 1915 the Mary Valley branch railway was opened. These industries heavily relied on rail transport. Fruit trains began operating from Gympie to Melbourne from 1923, and in 1929 the Gympie <b>Fruit</b> <b>Growers</b> <b>Co-operative</b> Association erected their premises opposite the station on Tozer Street.|$|E
50|$|The {{opening of}} the Mary Valley railway to Brooloo in 1915 and the {{connection}} between Cairns and Brisbane in 1924 sent more goods and people through Gympie. The Gympie district was the largest producer of bananas in Australia in the 1920s and an important pineapple growing area. Fruit trains began operating from Gympie to Melbourne and in 1923 the Gympie <b>Fruit</b> <b>Growers</b> <b>Co-operative</b> Association erected premises opposite the station on Tozer Street. The Wide Bay Co-operative Dairy Company also was located on Tozer Street and in 1925 built one of Australia's largest butter factories. By 1927 one tenth of Queensland's milk production was from the Gympie district. The centrality of the railway precinct to Gympie's economy offered enhanced opportunities for the Railway Hotel to generate business.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the poor}} {{financial}} results of the fruit industry in the last decade, the changing trade structures and more consumer-driven fruit chains, Dutch <b>fruit</b> <b>growers</b> change their market behaviour. In these circumstances, the fruit industry itself and the applied fruit research are also changing. Applied Plant Research (PPO-Fruit) is involved in different projects related to consumer-driven fruit chain development and their side effects on <b>fruit</b> <b>growers</b> and firms. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to describe two projects about new Dutch fruit chains in which PPO-Fruit is involved and their impact on <b>fruit</b> <b>growers</b> and research. The projects are: a special variety chain, based on the Dutch apple variety Santana, which is scab resistant (Vf) and a regional crop chain ¿Betuwe framboos¿, (= Betuwe raspberry). It is clear that being part of a fruit chain means another way of working for the <b>fruit</b> <b>growers</b> and the other partners as well. They have to work according growing recipes and also recipes/procedures for other activities, like storage, packaging. This means a decrease of independence for the growers. PPO-Fruit works as a facilitator, a knowledge centre and executes experiments to solve new problem...|$|R
