5|$|In the episode, the {{starship}} Enterprise arrives at Deep Space Station K7 to guard a consignment of grain bound for Sherman's Planet. On arrival, a trader named Cyrano Jones (Stanley Adams) gives Lt. Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) a tribble, a small, furry alien lifeform, with dramatic consequences. Captain James T. Kirk {{and the crew}} also <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> arrival of Captain Koloth (William Campbell) and his Klingon battlecruiser, but the tribbles unexpectedly reveal a plot to poison the grain.|$|E
5|$|This led to {{proposals}} {{for a new}} radar dedicated solely to the early warning role, determining only which MAR or SCD would ultimately <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> threat. Used primarily in the first minutes of the attack, and {{not responsible for the}} engagements, the system could be considered disposable and did not need anything like the sophistication or hardening of the MAR. This led to the Perimeter Acquisition Radar (PAR), which would operate cheaper electronics at VHF frequencies.|$|E
5|$|World War II {{was also}} the first {{conflict}} in which women, other than nurses, were allowed to serve in the U.S. Armed Forces. However, when the United States entered World War II, Puerto Rican nurses volunteered for service but were not accepted into the Army or Navy Nurse Corps. As a result, many of the island's women work force migrated to the mainland U.S. to work in the factories which produced military equipment. In 1944, the Army Nurse Corps decided to actively recruit Puerto Rican nurses so that Army hospitals would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> language barriers. Among them was Second Lieutenant Carmen Lozano Dumler, who {{became one of the first}} Puerto Rican female military officers.|$|E
500|$|The film's {{original}} {{score was}} composed by Alexandre Desplat. In {{a film about}} a man struggling to articulate himself, Desplat was wary of overshadowing the dramaturgy: [...] "This is a film about {{the sound of the}} voice.

5|$|A {{number of}} factors made escape {{attempts}} daunting for the internees. They would have to navigate through Japanese-occupied territory, find food, and as few internees spoke Cantonese, they would also <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> language barrier if they succeeded in escaping. Despite these difficulties, there were three major escape attempts, of which two in March 1942 were successful. One group of eight internees escaped on a small boat to neighbouring Macau. Another group, consisting of two internees, escaped through the New Territories and into mainland China. The third group, four policemen, in April 1942 managed to escape the camp grounds but were caught within {{a few miles of}} camp. They were subsequently imprisoned and released back to camp after a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|Freshly {{relocated}} from Sacramento, the San Antonio Texans {{finally found}} {{success on the}} field in 1995 playing in the brand new Alamodome. The Alamodome offered two advantages over other U.S. facilities - it was a multi-purpose facility with retractable seating that could accommodate a full size CFL field, also, it was an indoor, air-conditioned facility which meant the teams playing there did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> summer heat. The team continued to be bankrolled by the enthusiastic Fred Anderson. Archer, entering his fifth year as Anderson's quarterback, led the second best offence in the league; he nevertheless suffered an injury late in the season, prompting the team to hire 45-year-old Joe Ferguson (whom Stephenson had coached {{as a member of}} the Buffalo Bills) out of retirement to serve as a backup. They finished 12–6 and finally made the playoffs. In the first round they trounced Birmingham, 51–9, before falling to the Baltimore Stallions, 21–11, in the South Division final. Team attendance was around the same level Anderson had previously seen in Sacramento.|$|E

25|$|That {{same year}} the Army Nurse Corps (ANC) decided to accept Puerto Rican nurses so that Army {{hospitals}} would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> language barriers.

25|$|No space colonies {{have been}} built so far. Currently, the {{building}} of a space colony would present a set of huge technological and economic challenges. Space settlements would have to provide for nearly all (or all) the material needs of hundreds or thousands of humans, in an environment out in space that is very hostile to human life. They would involve technologies, such as controlled ecological life support systems, that have yet to be developed in any meaningful way. They would also <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> as-yet unknown issue of how humans would behave and thrive in such places long-term.

500|$|Devers sent a {{cable to}} Marshall on 1 July proposing that an army group be formed, with himself as commander. Eisenhower concurred with this on 12 July. While {{it would have}} been easy enough to add the Seventh Army to Bradley's 12th Army Group, this would have meant that Eisenhower would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> French, and after his {{experience}} in Operation Torch, Eisenhower preferred to let Devers do it. Marshall made the appointment on 16 July. Thus, Devers wore four [...] "hats" [...] for the operation: Deputy Supreme Allied Commander, Mediterranean Theater; Commanding General NATOUSA; Commander, Advanced Detachment AFHQ, which was activated on 29 July; and Commanding General, 6th Army Group, which Devers activated on 1 August.|$|E
500|$|The show {{revolves}} around the adventures of three kindergarten aged girls with superpowers: Blossom (pink), Bubbles (blue), and Buttercup (green). The plot of an episode is usually some humorous variation of standard superhero and tokusatsu shows, with the girls using their powers to defend their town from villains and giant monsters. In addition, the girls <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> normal issues that young children face, such as sibling rivalries, loose teeth, personal hygiene, going to school, bed wetting, or dependence on a security blanket. Episodes often contain hidden references to older pop culture (especially noticeable in the episode [...] "Meet the Beat Alls," [...] which is an homage to the Beatles). The cartoon always tries to keep different ideas within each episode with some small tributes and parodies thrown in.|$|E

500|$|Allan Bakke {{had given}} few {{interviews}} during the pendency of the case, {{and on the}} day it was decided, went to work as usual in Palo Alto.

Most of the lawyers and university personnel who would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> aftermath of Bakke doubted the decision would change very much. [...] The large majority of affirmative action programs at universities, unlike that of the UC Davis medical school, did not use rigid numerical quotas for minority admissions and could continue.

500|$|Comparing it to {{the more}} subdued {{palettes}} of his prior Radiohead artworks, Donwood described the cover's bright, [...] "pleasing" [...] colours as [...] "ominous because all these colours that I've used are derived from the petrol-chemical industry... None of it is natural. It essentially comes from black sludge. We've created this incredibly vibrant society, but we're going to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> consequences sooner or later." [...] Essayist Amy Britton interpreted the artwork as an allusion to the Bush administration's [...] "road map for peace" [...] plan for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Joseph Tate, likening the art to the paintings of French artist Jean Dubuffet, found it depicted a [...] "homogenized and heavily regimented" [...] portrayal of [...] "capitalism's glaring visual presence: an oppressive sameness of style and color that mirrors globalization's reduction of difference." [...] Other artworks included with the album refer to cities including New York, London, Grozny, and Baghdad. Early editions contained a fold-out road map of the cover.|$|E

He planned to write the script over the summer and begin production in spring or summer 2003 for a 2004 release. Carter described the film as independent of the series, saying [...] "We're looking at the movies as stand-alones.

Cunningham, Randall Emmett, George Furla and Mark Canton would be the executive producers. On August 2016, the network announced that decided to not move forward with the series. The CW president Mark Pedowitz explained, “We had better pilots. The bottom line is we felt we had stronger things to go with, and we didn’t go forward with it. It was well-written, it was darker than we wanted it to be, and we didn’t believe it had sustainability... We didn’t believe that it was a sustainable script, a sustainable series. It was a very good pilot, but not a sustainable series." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} {{synchronize}} the samples, The Bomb Squad used SMPTE timecodes and arranged and overdubbed particular bits of backing tracks, {{which had been}} inspected by the members for snare, bass, and hi-hat sounds. Chuck D said of their production and sampling, [...] "Our music is all about samples in the right area, layers that pile on each other. We put loops on top of loops on top of loops, but then in the mix we cut things away". Their production was innovative, according to journalist Jeff Chang. [...] "They're {{figuring out how to}} jam with the samples and to create these layers of sound", Chang said. [...] "I don't think it’s been matched since then." [...] After the tracks were completed, The Bomb Squad began sequencing what was at first a seemingly discontinuous album, amid internal disputes among its members. The final mixing took place at Greene St. Recording and lasted until February 1990. According to Sadler, [...] "a lot of people were like, 'Wow, it's a brilliant album'.
