5|$|Teaneck {{was created}} on February19, 1895 by {{an act of}} the New Jersey Legislature from {{portions}} of Englewood Township and Ridgefield Township, both of which are now defunct (<b>despite</b> <b>existing</b> municipalities with similar names), along with portions of Bogota and Leonia. Independence followed the result of a referendum held on January14, 1895, in which voters favored incorporation by a 46–7 margin. To address the concerns of Englewood Township's leaders, the new municipality was formed as a township, rather than succumbing to the borough craze sweeping across Bergen County at the time. On May3, 1921, and June1, 1926, portions of what had been Teaneck were transferred to Overpeck Township.|$|E

25|$|Third, {{class action}} cases may {{be brought to}} {{purposely}} change behavior of a class of which the defendant is a member. Landeros v. Flood (1976) was a landmark case decided by the California Supreme Court that aimed at purposefully changing the behavior of doctors, encouraging them to report suspected child abuse. Otherwise, they would face the threat of civil action for damages in tort proximately flowing from the failure to report the suspected injuries. Previously, many physicians had remained reluctant to report cases of apparent child abuse, <b>despite</b> <b>existing</b> law that required it.|$|E
25|$|In 1895, Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts (United States) {{established}} {{a population of}} domestic albino brown rats to {{study the effects of}} diet and for other physiological studies. Over the years, rats have been used in many experimental studies, which have added to our understanding of genetics, diseases, the effects of drugs, and other topics that have provided a great benefit for {{the health and well-being of}} humankind. The aortic arches of the rat are among the most commonly studied in murine models due to marked anatomical homology to the human cardiovascular system. Both rat and human aortic arches exhibit subsequent branching of the brachiocephalic trunk, left common cartoid artery and left subclavian artery, as well as geometrically similar, non-planar curvature in the aortic branches. Aortic arches studied in rats exhibit abnormalities similar to those of humans, including altered pulmonary arteries and double or absent aortic arches. <b>Despite</b> <b>existing</b> anatomical analogy in the inthrathoracic position of the heart itself, the murine model of the heart and its structures remains a valuable tool for studies of human cardiovascular conditions.|$|E
500|$|Before the {{establishment}} of the National Action Plan, a variety of people and organizationsincluding First Nations, human trafficking victims, law enforcement, and victim service providerscriticized Canada for failing to have such a plan. Charles Momy, president of the Canadian Police Association, said that <b>despite</b> <b>existing</b> efforts from local law enforcement agencies, Canada lacked and required [...] "a coordinated response to ensure the offenders are prosecuted, and put a stop to this modern day form of slavery." [...] In October 2008, John Fenn of Toronto's Streetlight Support Services expressed his frustration that there was still no national action plan on this subject despite the passing of the corresponding motion the previous year. Fenn said, [...] "Even if we make a muck of the thing if we get started, let's get started." [...] Benjamín Santamaria of Project Desert Roses, another Toronto-based organization, voiced the same complaint.|$|E

500|$|<b>Despite</b> <b>existing</b> {{from the}} early 4th century, the only full list of scholae {{available}} is in the Notitia, which shows the position {{at the end of}} the 4th century/early 5th century. At that time, there were 12 scholae, of which 5 were assigned to the Western emperor and 7 to the Eastern. These regiments of imperial escort cavalry would have totalled c. 6,000 men, compared to 2,000 equites singulares Augusti in the late 2nd century. The great majority (10) of the scholae were [...] "conventional" [...] cavalry, armoured in a manner similar to the alae of the Principate, carrying the titles scutarii ("shield-men"), armaturae ("armour" [...] or [...] "harnesses") or gentiles ("natives"). These terms appear to have become purely honorific, although they may originally have denoted special equipment or ethnic composition (gentiles were barbarian tribesmen admitted to the empire on a condition of military service). Only two scholae, both in the East, were specialised units: a schola of clibanarii (cataphracts, or heavily armoured cavalry), and a unit of mounted archers (sagittarii). 40 select troops from the scholae, called candidati from their white uniforms, acted as the emperor's personal bodyguards.|$|E

2500|$|While {{criticism}} of the book was to be expected, the publisher was apparently surprised by the pressure brought against it to not publish The Skeptical Environmentalist.
