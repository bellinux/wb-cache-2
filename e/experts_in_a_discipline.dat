40|$|Introduction The {{process of}} {{decision}} making has been widely studied within different academic paradigms. Many theories and models have been developed from this research activity. However, {{there is a lack}} of in-depth research on individuals’ experience {{of decision making}}. The present research explores this topic with Clinical Psychologists. This group of professionals are trained to be <b>expert</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> specific <b>discipline,</b> which emphasises the need for making informed judgements and for justifying decisions. Objectives To provide an in-depth account of how Clinical Psychologists experience decision making in the context of clinical practice. To relate the analysis to theories and models of decision making and to research on factors thought to influence judgement and decision making. Method Semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven Clinical Psychologists. These were transcribed and analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) methodology. Outcomes Elements of the decision making environment such as managing one’s conflicting beliefs and difficult emotions, responding to uncertainty and changeable scenarios and normative versus unique elements of one’s practice were elucidated in the analyses. The contribution of this work to research in decision making and the development of clinical practice are discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|In our {{experience}} of computer scientists, we cooperate in participatory projects to develop computer systems {{to be used by}} professional people, such us medical doctors, geologists, mechanical engineers. These professionals need to use computer systems for performing their work tasks exploiting all the communication and operation possibilities offered by these systems, but they are not and do not want to become computer experts. This has motivated the definition of a particular class of end-users, that we call domain-expert users (or d-experts for short) [4]: they are <b>experts</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> specific <b>discipline</b> (e. g. medicine, geology, etc.), not necessarily <b>experts</b> <b>in</b> computer science, who use computer environments to perform their daily tasks. These d-experts often complain about the systems they use, they feel frustrated because of the difficulties they encounters interacting with them. In domains of their competence, communities of d-experts progressively developed documentation styles, notations and procedures to record the community’s knowledge- abstract or concrete concepts, prescriptions, results of activities- as documents. This enabled the community’s knowledge to be available to members when and where they require it and in the form required to perform their current activities. Notations developed by the communities of experts determine the layout and appearance of the document thus permitting the expression of tacit information – embedded and conveyed by the document shape as well as by images, icons, textual words, which are meaningful only for <b>experts</b> <b>in</b> the domain at hand. Documents expressed in these notations support reasoning based on implicit knowledge, namely the knowledg...|$|R
40|$|The Expert System is an enclosed, {{controlled}} environment for growing plants, which incorporates a computerized, knowledge-based software {{program that is}} designed to capture the knowledge, experience, and problem-solving skills of one or more human <b>experts</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> particular <b>discipline.</b> The <b>Expert</b> System is trained to analyze crop/plant status, to monitor the condition of the plants and the environment, and to adjust operational parameters to optimize the plant-growth process. This system is intended to provide a way to remotely control plant growth with little or no human intervention. More specifically, the term control implies an autonomous method for detecting plant states such as health (biomass) or stress and then for recommending and implementing cultivation and/or remediation to optimize plant growth and to minimize consumption of energy and nutrients. Because of difficulties associated with delivering energy and nutrients remotely, a key feature of this Expert System is its ability to minimize this effort and to achieve optimum growth while taking into account the diverse range of environmental considerations that exist <b>in</b> <b>an</b> enclosed environment. The plant-growth environment for the Expert System could be made from a variety of structures, including a greenhouse, an underground cavern, or another enclosed chamber. Imaging equipment positioned within or around the chamber provides spatially distributed crop/plant-growth information. Sensors mounted in the chamber provide data and information pertaining to environmental conditions that could affect plant development. Lamps in the growth environment structure supply illumination, and other additional equipment in the chamber supplies essential nutrients and chemicals...|$|R
40|$|Resources for {{tackling}} animal welfare issues are often limited. Obtaining a consensus of expert {{opinion on the}} most pressing issues to address is a valuable approach to try to ensure that resources are wisely spent. In this study, seven independent <b>experts</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> range of <b>disciplines</b> (including veterinary medicine, animal behaviour and welfare science and ethics) were consulted on the relative prioritisation of welfare issues impacting companion dogs <b>in</b> Great Britain. <b>Experts</b> first anonymously ranked the priority of 37 welfare issues, pre-defined from a literature review and an earlier published survey. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> subsequent two-day panel workshop, experts refined these issues into 25 composite groups and used specific criteria to agree their relative priorities as a Welfare Problem (WP; incorporating numbers of dogs affected, severity, duration and counter-balancing benefits) and a Strategic Priority (SP; a combination of WP and tractability). Other criteria — anthropogenicity, ethical significance and confidence in the issue-relevant evidence — were also discussed by the panel. Issues that scored highly for both WP and SP were: inappropriate husbandry, lack of owner knowledge, undesirable behaviours, inherited disease, inappropriate socialisation and habituation and conformation-related disorders. Other welfare issues, such as obese and overweight dogs, were judged as being important for welfare (WP) but not strategic priorities (SP), due to the expert-perceived difficulties in their management and resolution. This information can inform decisions on where future resources can most cost-effectively be targeted, {{to bring about the}} greatest improvement in companion dog welfare in Great Britain...|$|R
40|$|Scientific {{journals}} {{despite their}} evolution in recent years, continue to face some problems. First, the criticism continuous review system. Second, {{a crisis of}} business models that the Open Access movement in many cases has increased. Regarding the review system, some initiatives (F 10000 Research) and methods (Post Publication) are considering to reinforce, first, the link between author and magazine, which is often diluted or disappear once the item is finally accepted (Hunter, 2012). These processes may include post-publication or not the authors (not necessarily include a process Open Peer Review). Moreover, there are approaches that can help give value to these processes. Thus, scientific journals can become communities that have added value to the published contents. Perhaps one of these potential added value of the journals to consider {{is the opportunity to}} share the knowledge generated around them. The fact that <b>experts</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> particular <b>discipline</b> or field could benefit from the experience of others through their research, case studies, ways to approach specific issues, etc can lead to greater interest in following specific publication. Thus, it would not be only a matter of content (which has been conducted a review), but emerged comments about the methodology, future applications, etc. Besides knowing the results of a particular job, it could participate through communities of the manufacturing process of the investigation of the possible obstacles encountered and how these were resolved, and alternatives proposed by other community members. It is therefore try, to get to know specific details that are not reflected in the articles and to share and exchange experiences with other <b>experts</b> <b>in</b> the field. The kind of community emerging around the end of this interest will depend {{on the nature of the}} activity generated by its members. But communities where knowledge is generated, ie, communities called value, are three: community of practice, community of interest or community of learning (Sanz-Martos, 2012). The hostel space community could also help in capturing the advertising for the magazine. If communities reach a large volume of members and participation could become an attractive place for advertising and generate a model of alternative or complementary business. In the communication that will be presented in CRECS 2015, various types of existing communities are valued and the advantages and disadvantages they may have on their development in some of the experiences that are taking place in terms of post-publication weighted...|$|R
40|$|Typically, {{the design}} of {{cognitive}} models has not emphasized the role of interfaces for describing the models' behavior. Models that populate synthetic environments are particularly complex and need support in this area. Using a variety of subject-matter experts we evaluated {{the use of the}} Situation Awareness Panel (SAP) as a tool for inspecting the behavior and reasoning of Soar agents <b>in</b> <b>a</b> JSAF simulation. We gathered suggestions on how to improve future implementations of the SAP from <b>experts</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> variety of <b>disciplines,</b> including military pilots, cognitive psychologists, an HCI specialist, a logistic specialist, and a software designer. Because of their diversity, we found that all were able to report unique problems with the interface, and thus now suggest about twice as many experts be used for evaluations than were previously suggested and that the <b>experts</b> should vary <b>in</b> their perspective. We used their behavior and reports to develop a task analysis that {{can be used as a}} general guide for future designs of user interfaces for cognitive models in general and for {{the design of}} interfaces for models in synthetic environments in particular.

Introducing Evaluating Interfaces Using Multiple Expert-types Newell's [9] call for a unified theory of cognition has led to a new way of research in cognitive psychology.

The {{purpose of this study is}} to discern differences between art and science students in adult education, to determine impetus for and initiation of their academic pursuits, and to identify commonalities in persistent adult learners.

40|$|My {{dissertation}} exposes and interprets unnoticed {{points of}} intersection between American visual {{culture and the}} rhetoric, logic, and imagery of institutions and disciplines dedicated to rationalizing chance [...] insurance, census, statistics, probabilism [...] around 1900, when popular, mathematical, and philosophical conceptions of the accident were undergoing considerable revision. Following the Civil War, <b>experts</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> number of <b>disciplines</b> and commercial enterprises counted, measured, and classified individual experiences, bodies, and lives. Statistically minded theorists recognized that, given a large enough sample, phenomena previously considered random or divinely predetermined, such as death, injury, accident, disease, and crime, occurred regularly and were, to a degree, predictable. Anthropometrists also noticed that anatomical and physiognomic traits were distributed according to statistically evident norms. Innovative graphic techniques were developed to visualize, dramatize, and publicize the previously invisible trends, laws, and patterns revealed by such statistical analysis. Insurance underwriters gathered vital statistics and compiled actuarial charts, effectively quantifying lives and configuring individuals in terms of risk. Insurance advertisements portrayed the modern world {{as a place of}} hazard and imminent peril manageable only through accident and life coverage. My dissertation demonstrates that this statistical and actuarial calculus manifested in works of art as Americans began to think, speak, and visualize their world in terms of risk, odds, and contingency. Organized as a series of case studies, my work demonstrates that visual culture fully engaged with the abstract concepts [...] chance, risk [...] and mathematical disciplines [...] statistics, probabilism [...] that informed this emergent worldview. My study builds on recent social histories of chance, enhancing and complicating them by considering understudied imagery [...] insurance advertising; composite photography; statistical graphics [...] and period documents overlooked by art historians [...] census questionnaires; actuarial life tables; Edward Bellamy's 1888 novel Looking Backward [...] to reveal not only how this material informs major artworks, but also how works of art participated <b>in</b> underwriting <b>an</b> emerging conception of the world as an ultimately indeterminate, chance-based system.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Global competitiveness challenges manufacturing industry to bring to market well designed and manufactured new products at competitive prices, <b>in</b> as short <b>a</b> lead time as possible. To achieve this, inputs are needed from <b>experts</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> multitude of <b>disciplines</b> {{as well as from}} customers and suppliers. The overall design must be well orchestrated and integrated which has led to the evolution of the philosophy of Concurrent Engineering where the decisions about different aspects related to the product's life cycle, must be considered simultaneously. While the use of design teams is achieving some success {{there is a need for}} modern software tools which support the design process to be radically improved. Typically design for manufacture software systems provide only support for a single process e. g. design for assembly, design for machining, design for fixturing etc. However, when the full breadth of design for manufacture is considered there are many aspects that must be addressed. This leads to the need for information systems to be able to support multiple views of a product, where each view provides the appropriate representation to support at least one manufacturing perspective. This research has investigated the potential of product model based systems to support multiple viewpoints in Design for Manufacture. The research has focused on the design for manufacture of plastic injection moulded products and has explored the particular viewpoints of mouldability, mould design and mould manufacturing. The approach taken has been to explore particular information structures to support each Design for Manufacture application. Subsequently, the relationships between these information structures have been investigated and sets of translating mechanisms to convert information from one view to another have been designed. An experimental Product Model has been implemented using an object-oriented database. This contains a mouldability view, cavity and core design views and cavity and core machining views. Translation mechanisms between views have been implemented using Visual C++ language. The concept and implementation of this research have been tested through experiments using both rotational and prismatic products. This research has therefore shown that multiple viewpoint design for manufacturing can be supported by a combination of product model data structures and specific sets of translation mechanisms...|$|R
