5|$|Assessments of {{the mating}} system {{of this species}} have found that outcrossing rates vary between populations, with populations in {{disturbed}} environments tending to be more inbred than populations in relatively intact bushland.

5|$|Most teleost {{species are}} oviparous, having {{external}} <b>fertilisation</b> with both eggs and sperm being {{released into the}} water for <b>fertilisation.</b> Internal <b>fertilisation</b> occurs in 500 to 600 species of teleosts but is more typical for Chondrichthyes and many tetrapods. This involves the male inseminating the female with an intromittent organ. Fewer than {{one in a million}} of externally fertilised eggs survives to develop into a mature fish, but there is a much better chance of survival among the offspring of members of about a dozen families which are viviparous. In these, the eggs are fertilised internally and retained in the female during development. Some of these species, like the live-bearing aquarium fish in the Poeciliidae family, are ovoviviparous; each egg has a yolk sac which nourishes the developing embryo, and when this is exhausted, the egg hatches and the larva is expelled into the water column. Other species, like the splitfins in the family Goodeidae, are fully viviparous, with the developing embryo nurtured from the maternal blood supply via a placenta-like structure that develops in the uterus. Oophagy is practised by a few species, such as Nomorhamphus ebrardtii; the mother lays unfertilised eggs on which the developing larvae feed in the uterus, and intrauterine cannibalism has been reported in some halfbeaks.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of salamanders also engage in internal <b>fertilisation.</b> In most of these, the male deposits a spermatophore, a small packet of sperm {{on top of}} a gelatinous cone, on the substrate either on land or in the water. The female takes up the sperm packet by grasping it with the lips of the cloaca and pushing it into the vent. The spermatozoa move to the spermatheca in the roof of the cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may be many months later. Courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the spermatophore vary between species. In some, the spermatophore may be placed directly into the female cloaca while in others, the female may be guided to the spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called amplexus. Certain primitive salamanders in the families Sirenidae, Hynobiidae and Cryptobranchidae practice external <b>fertilisation</b> in a similar manner to frogs, with the female laying the eggs in water and the male releasing sperm onto the egg mass.|$|E

In non-competitive <b>fertilisations,</b> offspring of exposed males suffered significant costs of reduced hatching success and survival but they reached a higher body condition than their counterparts from unexposed fathers after experimental infection. Interestingly, those benefits of paternal infection did not result from increased resistance but from increased tolerance to the parasite.

40|$|Forty years ago, {{more than}} 90 % of bird species were {{classified}} as monogamous and not very exciting systems for studies of e. g. sexual selection. Since then, the discovery of extra-pair paternity (EPP) in more than 75 % of surveyed monogamous bird species has made avian monogamy, and the interaction between social and genetic mating systems in general, a challenging and attractive area of research. Despite three decades of research on EPP in birds, however, many questions and controversies remain unresolved. This thesis contributes {{to the understanding of}} mechanisms and adaptive reasons, primarily from the female’s perspective, for the highly diverse frequencies of EPP in birds. First, in a population of the common redshank (Tringa totanus), a wader for which the genetic mating system has not been described previously, a surprising absence of EPP is demonstrated (I). Presumably, some female pre- or postcopulatory resistance to extra-pair <b>fertilisations</b> is present. The potential mechanisms and adaptive significance of this is discussed in relation to redshank ecology and behaviour. In the three following papers (II-IV), assumptions and predictions of hypothesised female benefits from EPP are addressed. In sand martins (Riparia riparia), there were no indications that extra-pair <b>fertilisations</b> resulted in genetic benefits (e. g. heterozygosity or ‘good genes’) (II). Paper III tests an assumption related to the genetic compatibility hypothesis, i. e. that overall heterozygosity leads to increased chick survival; this {{did not seem to be}} the case in Kentish plovers (Charadrius alexandrinus). In northern lapwings (Vanellus vanellus), the indirect benefits hypothesis is partly supported by a positive association between EPP and brood sex ratio (IV). As predicted by the differential sex allocation hypothesis, broods with extra-pair offspring contained a higher proportion of sons than broods without extrapair offspring. As for the yet unknown mechanism of sex determination in birds, an unusual case of a fertile, triploid Kentish plover female is presented and discussed with regard to the two present major hypotheses for sexdetermination (VI). Finally, as an alternative or additional interpretation of what appears to be brood sex ratio adjustment by the female, the often neglected effect of differential mortality is discussed (V) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Fairy-wrens (genus Malurus) {{maintain}} territories year round, and breed cooperatively, {{with all}} members of the social group provisioning young. Despite living with several adult males, the breeding female typically cuckolds all of them, seeking <b>fertilisations</b> from extra-groupmales that provide no care to her offspring, instead caring for the young reared on their own territory. We trace the evolutionary origins and persistence of this extraordinary combination of traits. We argue that the high rate of infidelity in some fairy-wrens facilitates social pairing among nuclear family relatives, rather than being an evolutionary response to avoid inbreeding. It seems likely that females mate with extra-groupmales to improve the genetic quality of their offspring. The ability ofmales tomaintain breeding plumage for long periods is the primary criterion for female choice; only older males can do so. Several features of the mating system undermine the accuracy of female choice, and low-quality males exploit this uncertainty. Extra-group matings by low-quality males can help stabilise the mating system but may leave it vulnerable to collapse under certain circumstances. Nonetheless, sexual selection in most species is very strong, confirming the utility of fairy-wrens as model organisms for the study of mate choice and intersexual selection...|$|R

Males typically enter the burrow first and we found that 71 % of females will follow him down and 54 % decide to stay and mate. However, some males use an alternative tactic where he will wait for the female to enter the burrow first, after which he traps her inside. Although a significantly lower percentage of females will enter a burrow following this behaviour (41 %), upon entry 79 % females that enter will become trapped and almost all of these females (90 %) produce a clutch of eggs.

In some cases, alloparents may find themselves investing in heterospecific young, and gaining none, or very little overall fitness benefit.
