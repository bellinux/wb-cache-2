5|$|After {{graduating from}} high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to {{participate}} in the disinvestment from South Africa <b>in</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> nation's policy of apartheid. In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan and India for three weeks. Later in 1981, he transferred as a junior to Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations and in English literature and lived off-campus on West 109th Street. He graduated with a BA degree in 1983 and worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer, then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.|$|E
5|$|The timing {{could not}} have been better for the Vale Royal community, for in a storm 19 October 1360 the arcades of the {{unfinished}} nave of their abbey church collapsed, and rebuilding {{could not have}} been funded by the abbey without outside help; even so, their original ambitious plans were never carried out in full. It has been suggested that the transfer was arranged, after the collapse, in order to provide funds for Vale Royal Abbey to repair their church. However the legal formalities, beginning with the appropriation by the feofees, was too soon after the storm to realistically have been <b>in</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> event. Given that the abbey was already – and remained – in debt, the reason for the appropriation was probably related to that. As corporate rector, Vale Royal Abbey was responsible for appointing a vicar and for the care of the chancel, leaving the rest of the church to be maintained by the parish.|$|E

25|$|The United States {{and other}} NATO states often ignore this {{sensitive}} issue, likely because of potential effects on their war strategy in Afghanistan.

This came after the November 2011 NATO bombing in which 24 Pakistani soldiers were killed. <b>In</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> incident, Pakistan decided to cut off all NATO supply lines as well as boost border security by installing anti-aircraft guns and radars to monitor air activity.

He is part of the crew on Inside the NBA, a post-game show during which Barkley, Ernie Johnson Jr., Kenny Smith and Shaquille O'Neal recap and comment on NBA games that have occurred during the day and also on general NBA affairs.

Albert replied to Barkley, [...] "I believe Dick would beat you in a footrace." [...] <b>In</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> remark, Barkley went on to challenge Bavetta to a race at the 2007 NBA All-Star Weekend for $5,000.

500|$|According to Crowley, every {{individual}} has a True Will, to {{be distinguished from}} the ordinary wants and desires of the ego. The True Will is essentially one's [...] "calling" [...] or [...] "purpose" [...] in life. Some later magicians have taken this to include the goal of attaining self-realization by one's own efforts, {{without the aid of}} God or other divine authority. This brings them close to the position that Crowley held just prior to 1904. [...] Others follow later works such as Liber II, saying that one's own will in pure form is nothing other than the divine will. [...] Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law for Crowley refers not to hedonism, fulfilling everyday desires, but to acting <b>in</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> calling. [...] The Thelemite is a mystic. [...] According to Lon Milo DuQuette, a Thelemite is anyone who bases their actions on striving to discover and accomplish their true will, when a person does their True Will, it is like an orbit, their niche in the universal order, and the universe assists them. [...] In order for the individual to be able to follow their True Will, the everyday self's socially-instilled inhibitions may have to be overcome via deconditioning. [...] Crowley believed that in order to discover the True Will, one had to free the desires of the subconscious mind from the control of the conscious mind, especially the restrictions placed on sexual expression, which he associated with the power of divine creation. He identified the True Will of each individual with the Holy Guardian Angel, a daimon unique to each individual. [...] The spiritual quest to find what you are meant to do and do it is also known in Thelema as the Great Work.|$|E
