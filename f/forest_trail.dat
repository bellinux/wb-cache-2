25|$|Opened in June 2007. The Kaziranga <b>Forest</b> <b>Trail</b> is Dublin Zoo's Asian {{elephant}} enclosure and {{is named}} after the Kaziranga National Park in India. The zoo is home to 11 elephants, two adult females named Bernhardine and Yasmin, two younger females named Asha (Bernhardine's daughter) and Anak (Yasmin's daughter) and a bull named Upali. The enclosure features a waterfall and two pools for the elephants, as well as sheltered viewing areas and a children's playground for visitors, and the elephants share their enclosure with a breeding pair of blackbuck.It {{is also home to}} two young male elephants named Kavi and Ashoka who were born on 17 July and 19 August 2014 and young female Samiya who was born 17 September 2014. The Kaziranga <b>Forest</b> <b>Trail</b> most recently became home to baby girls Zinda born 19th September 2016 and Avani born 13th March 2017 and little bull elephant Kabir born 15th May 2017 to proud mum Yasmin.|$|E
25|$|One {{stand of}} tall {{trees in the}} centre of the park did not survive beyond the 1960s after {{becoming}} a popular tourist attraction. The “Seven Sisters” are memorialized by a plaque and young replacement trees in the same location along Lovers Walk, a <b>forest</b> <b>trail</b> that connects Beaver Lake with Second Beach. “They were so popular that people basically killed them by walking on their roots,” says historian John Atkin.|$|E
25|$|Riesch's patrols {{told him}} that two French {{divisions}} were in the area. Instead of pushing into the combat raging to his front, he cautiously decided to wait for his stragglers to arrive at Albaching. He then fell into the same error as Latour. Dividing his two powerful divisions under Feldmarschall-Leutnant Ignaz Gyulai and Feldmarschall-Leutnant Maximilian, Count of Merveldt into five small columns, he sent each forward on a separate <b>forest</b> <b>trail.</b> Riesch held back three battalions {{and most of his}} cavalry as a reserve.|$|E

25|$|Until 1800 {{the region}} of São Pedro and its enclave was virgin forest. The first civilized people to set foot in Águas de São Pedro {{territory}} were, as in most municipalities in the São Paulo countryside, bandeirantes seeking precious stones, especially gold, opening many roads and routes in the dense forest. One of these routes, called Caminho do Picadão (Way of the <b>Forest</b> <b>Trail),</b> started in Itu, passed through Piracicaba and advanced towards the hinterlands of Araraquara. For years, many farms were established in the region, until in 1883, São Pedro was detached from Piracicaba and became politically independent.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the threat}} of more landslides, {{residents}} of the neighbourhood were relocated to neighbors and various hotels around Bergen. A further 128 people in the houses beyond the slide-area found themselves isolated due to the destroyed access road, and had to use a <b>forest</b> <b>trail</b> when evacuated by emergency responders. As this trail would be the only way {{in and out of the}} neighbourhood for days, it was paved with gravel. Gaia Trafikk, the city's bus company, set up a short makeshift bus route for the residents to help them get to work. The bus operated between Hamreveien, a minor road at the end of the trail, to the closest bus stop in Osvegen. Vandalism concerns for the abandoned houses caused the police to use floodlights to patrol the area.|$|E
25|$|Marcognet {{received}} {{promotion to}} Adjutant General (colonel) in the 108th Line Infantry Demi-Brigade on 18 June 1800. At the Battle of Hohenlinden on 3 December 1800, the 2,234-strong 108th Line served in Emmanuel Grouchy's division of Moreau's army. As {{the head of}} Johann Kollowrat's Left Center Column advanced along the main highway from the east, they bumped into Marcognet's 108th Line at about 7:00 AM. He deployed his troops in line {{along the edge of}} a forest. Franz Löpper, who led the Austro-Bavarian advance guard, immediately ordered his 5,341 foot soldiers and 1,319 cavalrymen to attack. Showing tactical finesse, Marcognet repulsed the first attack by the Benjowski Infantry Regiment Nr. 31 {{with the help of the}} 4th Hussars and three cannons. Outnumbered two-to-one, he was holding his ground when enemy reinforcements arrived. Using a <b>forest</b> <b>trail,</b> Lelio Spannochi secretly posted the Sebottendorf Grenadier Battalion on the flank of the 108th Line and charged. Surprised, the French rapidly retreated leaving the wounded Marcognet to be captured.|$|E

500|$|Much later, about 600 {{million years}} ago, shallow seas covered the region around present-day Tucson; over time {{that led to}} {{deposition}} of sedimentary rocks—limestones, sandstones, and shales. Limestone, which occurs in the park in several places, was mined here in the late 19th century to make mortar. The future park land had six lime kilns, two in the TMD, and four in the RMD. Three, all in the RMD, can be visited today—two along the Cactus <b>Forest</b> <b>Trail</b> and one along the Ruiz Trail.|$|E

2500|$|Hébert's {{powerful}} {{attack was}} {{stopped in the}} nick of time by Col. Jefferson C. Davis and the 3rd Division. Davis was originally destined for Elkhorn, but Curtis diverted his troops to Leetown after Osterhaus' report reached him. The four Southern regiments nearly overran Davis' leading brigade under Col. Julius White. Davis ordered a cavalry battalion to charge, but this effort was easily routed by the Southern infantry. When Col. Thomas Pattison's brigade arrived, Davis sent them up a <b>forest</b> <b>trail</b> to envelop Hébert's open left flank. Untroubled by the inert Confederate units on Foster's Farm, Osterhaus was able to [...] "box in" [...] Hébert's right flank. After very hard fighting in dense woods, the Confederates, pressed from three sides, were driven back to the Ford Road. In the smoky confusion, Hébert and a small party, having become separated from the rest of the left wing, blundered through a gap in the Federal lines and got lost in the woods. Later that day, a Federal cavalry unit captured Hébert and his group.|$|E
