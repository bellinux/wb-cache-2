Howarth replied, [...] "I know what the convention of a good-looking person is, and I know that for some reason skinny white guys are big now. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> could blame it on that." ...|$|E
500|$|Muntz {{developed}} a television chassis that produced an acceptable monochrome picture with 17tubes. He often carried {{a pair of}} wire clippers, and when he thought {{that one of his}} employees was [...] "overengineering" [...] a circuit, he would begin snipping components out until the picture or sound stopped working. At that point, he would tell the engineer [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> have to put that last part back in" [...] and walk away.|$|E

She is a pro-choice activist {{and sits on}} the board of advocates for Planned Parenthood.

500|$|Drummer Sherman Ferguson said of Ibn Ali, [...] "he was a {{prime example}} of {{somebody}} that was very avant-garde in some ways, but he was always musical. So people of all ages liked his music, even when he played out. [...] had that thing, where he had a natural feeling. He got to the thing where it swung no matter what he was doing." [...] Saxophonist Benny Golson commented that Ibn Ali [...] "became very skilled at the modern sounds, and then went right past them into something very esoteric. He went way out there. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> could say his brakes didn't work." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{playing for}} the Giants in October 1965, he told an interviewer: [...] "I'm playing {{football}} to convey Christianity either indirectly or directly and to give me access to you people. [...] The eye of American is upon the sports' field, so I can reach more people playing football. [...] <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> can say {{my goal is to}} spread a Christian message." [...] At that time, he was attending Princeton Theological Seminary once a week and planned to attend full-time after the football season. [...] Asked if the violent nature of football was inconsistent with his Christian beliefs, Timberlake noted that [...] "you don't need to hurt anyone to get by" [...] in football and that the game involved skill, timing and execution more than violence. [...] He then joked, [...] "There's nothing really wrong with good, clean violence." ...|$|E

500|$|On March 3, Entertainment Weekly {{reported}} that actor Jorge Garcia {{would be making}} a cameo appearance in an upcoming Fringe episode. Garcia, who previously starred as Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes from J.J. Abrams' Lost, appears as a Massive Dynamic guard that is smoking a bong with Walter {{at the start of}} the episode. Alan Ruck guests as Dr. Crick, the person behind the floating bodies. Ruck was approached by the show's producers having envisioned him for the role. Ruck described the character, [...] "He is no dummy... and he stumbled on to something and he is trying to figure out a way to use it. Ultimately he would like to use it for good, but in so doing he causes a lot of damage. So <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> can say he's obsessed. And this particular point in time where the episode of Fringe starts, time is fleeting and he's just... under the gun." [...] On his character's possible reappearance, Ruck commented, [...] "I think not... Technically yes , but probably not." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked in}} 2012 about {{his brother and}} an Oasis reunion Gallagher said [...] "I last texted Liam at Christmas after the City match. I don't think it's gonna happen. It would be great for {{everyone}} else except me. It'd be mega for the millions and millions and everybody else it would be brilliant but I wouldn't be very happy about it. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> don't know what you're gonna feel like in 20-odd years but right now, I mean I was in Oasis for nearly 20 years. I've been doing this what I'm doing now for one year and I'd {{like to see what}} it's like to do it for longer. I don't think anyone is pushing for a reunion either. Nobody ever brings it up in any seriousness – I mean Liam does publicly but he says a lot of things publicly. I wouldn't take anything he says seriously". After their performance of Wonderwall at the London Olympics Closing Ceremony (which Gallagher had originally turned down), he referred to Liam's band Beady Eye as 'Stratford's finest Oasis tribute band'.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of GoldenEye in {{reviving}} the Bond series, there was pressure to recreate that success in the film's follow-up production. This pressure came from MGM along with its new owner, billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, both of whom wished for the film's release to coincide with their public stock offering. Co-producer Michael G. Wilson also expressed concern regarding the public's expectations subsequent to {{the success of}} GoldenEye, commenting: [...] "You realize that there's a huge audience and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> don't want to come out with a film that's going to somehow disappoint them." [...] This was the first Bond film to be made after the death of Albert R. Broccoli, who had previously been involved with the series' production since its beginning. The rush to complete the film drove the budget to $110 million. The producers were unable to persuade Martin Campbell, the director of GoldenEye, to return; his agent said that [...] "Martin just didn't want to do two Bond films in a row." [...] Instead, Roger Spottiswoode was chosen in September 1996. Spottiswoode said he had previously offered to direct a Bond film while Timothy Dalton was still in the leading role.|$|E

500|$|When people google Jackson, some of {{the first}} search results feature her in the nude. Jackson said of this: [...] "Instead of being known for my {{basketball}} skills, all of these nudie shots are always the first thing you see." [...] She posed nude in an Australian magazine, Black+White, that featured Olympic athletes who were set to compete in Athens in the 2004 Summer Olympics. The expensively printed magazine/book has been produced for the last three Olympic Games and, by the 2004 edition, was considered uncontroversial in Australia with its [...] "artistic" [...] approach to nude photography, and its equal coverage of male and female athletes, although it did create a stir in the United States. She also posed for the 2005 edition of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. Of posing nude, she said, [...] "if offered the opportunity, I think that it's a personal decision. Whether you do it for the money or whatever, again, I think it's a personal decision. I don't know whether I would say yes or no. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> cross that bridge when you come to it. I don't think it's a bad thing, I'm not against it." ...|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} for his new television series Homeland, 24 executive producer Howard Gordon addressed {{the impact of the}} series, describing it as [...] "stunning - everyone from Rush Limbaugh to Bill Clinton would talk about it, and we knew they were among our fans. I guess when people used it as propaganda for their own ideas—you know, when Justice Scalia mentioned Jack Bauer—that would make me feel uncomfortable." [...] On the topic of torture and Islamophobia within the series, Gordon said, [...] "I think the one thing that we all felt very confident about—although we had a vigorous behind-the-scenes debate—was at what point are we loyal and beholden to good storytelling, and at what level do you hold yourself accountable for things like stoking Islamophobia or promoting torture as a policy? There were just certain things that we needed to portray {{in order to make it}} feel thrilling—and real, even. When discussing his regrets, he referred to an advertisement for the show for its fourth season (though mistakenly quoted it as an advertisement for the second season, saying [...] "I actually do have regrets about one particular moment, which had more to do with the promotion of the show. In season four, the story involved a Muslim American family, and the father and the mother—and the son—were party to a terror plot. It was sort of a purple conceit in a way. But it was maybe a year and a half after 9/11, and on the 405 freeway there's this giant electronic billboard, and I think the line was: [...] "They could be next door." [...] The writers and the producers were not party to that campaign, but we quickly put an end to it, and realized how dangerous and potentially incendiary this show could be. And I think our awareness of that changed the way we approached the series. So <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> could call it a regret, but it was really an epiphany.|$|E
2500|$|Gibson {{described}} his character Guy, saying, “He's not a silver-tongued devil. He's kind of immature {{and he has}} some rough edges and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> {{could say the same}} for me.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Voges was {{included}} in Australia's one-day squad for the tour of South Africa. Batsman Marcus North was called up as batting cover while Voges returned home to marry his fiancée.

2500|$|Don Henley {{has given}} a number of {{explanations}} about the song, ranging from [...] "a journey from innocence to experience" [...] to [...] "a sociopolitical statement". In an interview with Rolling Stone, Henley said that the song {{was meant to be}} [...] "more of a symbolic piece about America in general", and added: [...] "Lyrically, the song deals with traditional or classical themes of conflict: darkness and light, good and evil, youth and age, the spiritual versus the secular. [...] <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> could say it's a song about loss of innocence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gibson was {{initially}} reluctant {{to accept the}} role of Guy Hamilton. [...] "I didn't necessarily see my role as a great challenge. My character was, like the film suggests, a puppet. And I went with that. It wasn't some star thing, even though they advertised it that way." [...] Gibson saw some similarities {{between himself and the}} character of Guy. [...] "He's not a silver-tongued devil. He's kind of immature and he has some rough edges and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> could say the same for me." [...] Gibson has cited this screen performance as his personal favorite.|$|E

Shamrock's apparent size advantage did not factor into the fight, however; Shamrock experienced difficulty cutting weight {{for the first time and}} cut too much weight, weighing in at 201lbs, 4lbs under the 205lb. limit. Ortiz shed light upon his feelings before the fight in his book This is Gonna Hurt: The Life of a Mixed Martial Arts Champion; [...] "Ken Shamrock is a real good fighter.

2500|$|Mutemath has {{resisted}} being {{classified as a}} Christian band, even suing their record label Warner Brothers over being marketed as such. Paul Meany stated {{in an interview in}} 2006 that if his previous band Earthsuit (a Christian act) [...] "inspired anything, it was what not to do." [...] Drummer Darren King has also stated that he does not consider the band to be Christian. While Armistice explored themes of doubt and pessimism that the band has {{gone so far as to}} call [...] "atheistic," [...] Meany stated that the idea for the album Odd Soul was [...] "loosely based on our upbringing in what <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> could call eccentric Christianity," [...] and King further explained that they wanted to celebrate [...] "their weird religious roots."

2500|$|One of {{the five}} songs she had written by for her seventh studio album, Clarkson co-wrote [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] with {{frequent}} collaborator Greg Kurstin, who produced the track. Clarkson has said about writing the song: A lot {{of the reasons why}} I wrote [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] was I guess I didn't realize the gravity of the situation until I had a child of my own, and until I experienced love like I do with Brandon (Blackstock) on the daily basis. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> don't realize something is missing until you feel it. I can't imagine walking away from my little girl. I can't imagine not having that love anymore. I didn't know it was missing because I never had it.
