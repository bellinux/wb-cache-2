Additive framing is selecting features to augment the base model, while subtractive framing is deselecting features from the <b>fully-loaded</b> model. A focal issue for companies that could possibly offer such products or services with option framing is finding out which process, additive or subtractive framing, is bound to give a final configuration with more features. The scenarios of option framing can be described by a finite Markov chain process. The Markov chain attempts to capture the decision process of the two types of framing through the estimated probabilities of movement from one phase to the other. In each of the decision phases, the key measure is the number of features in the configuration and the transition probabilities. The option framing is used on an actual study, where the empirical results verify the theories favoring subtractive framing, such as differential loss aversion and anchoring-adjustment theories.

40|$|Steel {{storage racks}} are {{typically}} made of thin-walled cold formed steel profiles, which {{prove to be}} the most versatile, economic and sustainable elements for industrial rack construction. Their lightweight structural systems are usually designed to resist heavy load units, reaching considerable heights. However, the global behavior of storage racks under seismic actions is much less predictable than the behavior of steel buildings made of standard steel profiles and connections, mainly due to the perforations in their thin walled upright columns, and their semi-rigid beam-column and base plate joints. Full scale experimental investigations are greatly needed in order to understand and quantify the global performance of storage racks, and improve their design for seismic actions. For the first time in Europe, thanks to the funding provided by Research Fund for Coal and Steel (RFCS), an extensive full-scale push-over testing program has been carried out on 8 <b>fully-loaded</b> pallet racking specimens (4 unbraced and 4 braced racks), provided by 4 different international rack producers.

40|$|Abstract—Heterogeneous {{cellular}} networks (HCNs) are char-acterized by cells whose coverage {{areas may}} vary by orders of magnitude. It is natural therefore that their user populations (and hence traffic loads) will vary similarly. Yet, to date, random spatial models developed for HCNs generally {{assume that all}} base stations (BSs) are always transmitting and hence implicitly have the same load. This paper incorporates a flexible notion of BS load by conditionally thinning the interference field, conditional on the connection of a typical mobile to its serving BS. We derive the coverage probability – i. e. the Signal-to-Interference-Ratio (SIR) distribution – for a typical mobile in a K-tier HCN where each tier has an arbitrary load characterized by a traffic factor pk 2 [0, 1], where pk = 1 is fully loaded. <b>Fully-loaded</b> models are observed to be extremely pessimistic in terms of coverage, and the analysis shows that adding lightly loaded access points (e. g. pico or femtocells) to the macrocell network always increases the coverage probability.

40|$|Models {{have been}} {{developed}} to simulate the thermal characteristics of Crystalline Silicotitanate (CST) ion exchange media fully loaded with radioactive cesium in a column configuration and distributed within a waste storage tank. This work was conducted to support the Small Column Ion Exchange (SCIX) program which is focused on processing dissolved, high-sodium salt waste for the removal of specific radionuclides (including Cs- 137, Sr- 90, and actinides) within a High Level Waste (HLW) storage tank at the Savannah River Site. The SCIX design includes CST columns inserted and supported in the tank top risers for cesium removal. Temperature distributions and maximum temperatures across the column were calculated with a focus on process upset conditions. A two-dimensional computational modeling approach for the in-column ion-exchange domain was taken to include conservative, bounding estimates for key parameters such that the results would provide the maximum centerline temperatures achievable under the design configurations using a feed composition known to promote high cesium loading on CST. One salt processing scenario includes the transport of the loaded (and possibly ground) CST media to the treatment tank floor. Therefore, additional thermal modeling calculations were conducted using a three-dimensional approach to evaluate temperature distributions for the entire in-tank domain including distribution of the spent CST media either as a mound or a flat layer on the tank floor. These calculations included mixtures of CST with HLW sludge or loaded Monosodium Titanate (MST) media used for strontium/actinide sorption. The current full-scale design for the CST column includes one central cooling pipe and four outer cooling tubes. Most calculations assumed that the fluid within the column was stagnant (i. e. no buoyancy-induced flow) for a conservative estimate. A primary objective of these calculations was to estimate temperature distributions across packed CST beds immersed in waste supernate or filled with dry air under various accident scenarios. Accident scenarios evaluated included loss of salt solution flow through the bed (a primary heat transfer mechanism), inadvertent column drainage, and loss of active cooling in the column. The calculation results showed that for a wet CST column with active cooling through one central and four outer tubes and 35 C ambient external air, the peak temperature for the <b>fully-loaded</b> column is about 63 C under the loss of fluid flow accident, which is well below the supernate boiling point. The peak temperature for the naturally-cooled (no active, engineered cooling) wet column is 156 C under <b>fully-loaded</b> conditions, exceeding the 130 C boiling point. Under these conditions, supernate boiling would maintain the column temperature near 130 C until all supernate was vaporized. Without active engineered cooling and assuming a dry column suspended in unventilated air at 35 C, the <b>fully-loaded</b> column is expected to rise to a maximum of about 258 C due to the combined loss-of coolant and column drainage accidents. The modeling results demonstrate that the baseline design using one central and four outer cooling tubes provides a highly efficient cooling mechanism for reducing the maximum column temperature. Results for the in-tank modeling calculations clearly indicate that when realistic heat transfer boundary conditions are imposed on the bottom surface of the tank wall, as much as 450 gallons of ground CST (a volume equivalent to two ion exchange processing cycles) in an ideal hemispherical shape (the most conservative geometry) can be placed in the tank without exceeding the 100 C wall temperature limit. Furthermore, {{in the case of an}} evenly-distributed flat layer, the tank wall reaches the temperature limit after the ground CST material reaches a height of approximately 8 inches...|$|E

For <b>fully-loaded</b> systems (with 100 % utilization), we first propose a PO-optimal scheduler, namely ASAP-ensured earliest deadline (SEED), by focusing on ASAP tasks where the optimality of tasks’ ALAP preference is achieved implicitly due to the harmonicity of the PO-optimal schedules for such systems. Then, for underutilized systems (with less than 100 % utilization), we show the discrepancies between different PO-optimal schedules. By extending SEED, we propose a generalized preference-oriented earliest deadline (POED) scheduler that can obtain a PO-optimal schedule for any schedulable task set. We further evaluate the proposed PO-optimal schedulers through extensive simulations. The results show that, comparing to that of the well-known EDF scheduler, the scheduling overheads of SEED and POED are higher (but still manageable) due to the additional consideration of tasks ’ preferences. However, SEED and POED can achieve the preference-oriented execution objectives in a more successful way than EDF. I...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the novel}} concept of {{combined}} equalization is investigated for coded uplink MC-CDMA. For combined-equalization it is presumed that channel state information (CSI) {{is available at}} the transmitter (Tx) {{as well as at the}} receiver (Rx). As a result, combined-equalization achieves considerable performance improvements over preor post-equalization applied alone if the corresponding preand post-equalization techniques within combined-equalization are chosen in a preferred way. For combined-equalization the design criterion at Tx is optimal power assignment with respect to CSI rather than avoidance of multiple-access interference (MAI), whereas MAI cancellation followed by maximum ratio combining (MRC) of the almost interference free signal is the main task at Rx. Thus, combined-equalization offers two degrees of freedom - at Tx and Rx - in order to resolve the two contrary design goals of optimal power allocation with respect to the fading channel and MAI supression/avoidance. As a result, improved single-user bounds for MC-CDMA systems transmitting over fading channels are achieved in the case of combined-equalization. Simulation results show that these improved single-user bounds can be approached very closely even for <b>fully-loaded</b> systems if the combined pre- and postequalization techniques are chosen accordingly...|$|E
40|$|Carrier {{aggregation}} (CA) {{and small}} cells are two distinct features of next-generation cellular networks. Cellular networks with small cells {{take on a}} very heterogeneous characteristic, and are {{often referred to as}} HetNets. In this paper, we introduce a load-aware model for CA-enabled multi-band HetNets. Under this model, the impact of biasing can be more appropriately characterized; for example, it is observed that with large enough biasing, the spectral efficiency of small cells may increase while its counterpart in a <b>fully-loaded</b> model always decreases. Further, our analysis reveals that the peak data rate does not depend on the base station density and transmit powers; this strongly motivates other approaches e. g. CA to increase the peak data rate. Last but not least, different band deployment configurations are studied and compared. We find that with large enough small cell density, spatial reuse with small cells outperforms adding more spectrum for increasing user rate. More generally, universal cochannel deployment typically yields the largest rate; and thus a capacity loss exists in orthogonal deployment. This performance gap can be reduced by appropriately tuning the HetNet coverage distribution (e. g. by optimizing biasing factors).
