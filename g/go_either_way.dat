5|$|When {{competing}} for food, eagles will usually dominate other fish-eaters and scavengers, aggressively displacing mammals such as coyotes (Canis latrans) and foxes, and birds such as corvids, gulls, vultures and other raptors. Occasionally, coyotes, bobcats (Lynx rufus) and domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) can displace eagles from carrion, usually less confident immature birds, {{as has been}} recorded in Maine. Bald eagles are less active, bold predators than golden eagles and get relatively more of their food as carrion and from kleptoparasitism (although it is now generally thought that golden eagles eat more carrion than was previously assumed). However, the two species are roughly equal in size, aggressiveness and physical strength and so competitions can <b>go</b> <b>either</b> <b>way.</b> Neither species {{is known to be}} dominant, and the outcome depends on the size and disposition of the individual eagles involved. The bald eagle is thought to be much more numerous in North America than the golden eagle, with the bald species estimated to number at least 150,000 individuals, about twice as many golden eagles there are estimated to live in North America. Due to this, bald eagles often outnumber golden eagles at attractive food sources. Despite the potential for contention between these animals, in New Jersey during winter, a golden eagle and numerous bald eagles were observed to hunt snow geese alongside each other without conflict. Similarly, both eagle species have been recorded, via video-monitoring, to feed on gut pills and carcasses of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in remote forest clearings in the eastern Appalachian Mountains without apparent conflict. Many bald eagles are habitual kleptoparasites, especially in winters when fish are harder to come by. They have been recorded stealing fish from other predators such as ospreys, herons and even otters. They have also been recorded opportunistically pirating birds from peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus), prairie dogs from ferruginous hawks (Buteo regalis) and even jackrabbits from golden eagles. When they approach scavengers like dogs, gulls or vultures at carrion sites, they often aggressively attack them and try to force them to disgorge their food. Healthy adult bald eagles are not preyed on in the wild and are thus considered apex predators.|$|E
25|$|Although {{generally}} a less active hunter than the golden eagle, competition over food can <b>go</b> <b>either</b> <b>way</b> {{depending on the}} individual eagle.

25|$|Golden eagles, being {{habitual}} scavengers at carrion, {{come into}} conflict with scavenging birds as well. They may encounter corvids at carrion sites and the large passerines are often highly cautious, either feeding {{some distance from the}} eagle or waiting until the eagle is done eating, lest they be predaceously grabbed. Occasionally, however, corvids may behave more boldly around golden eagles. In one case, a group of three black-billed magpies were observed to rob a golden eagle of its prey. Golden eagles also usually dominate both New World and Old World vultures. Smaller species like black vulture (Coragyps atratus) in North America and Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) in Eurasia are known to be occasionally hunted by golden eagles. Besides the Steller's sea eagle, the larger species of Old World vulture and the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) are the only noticeably larger raptorial birds that a golden eagle may encounter. The relationship between these large vultures and golden eagles can be highly contentious, with most sources favoring victory for the eagle due to its more aggressive disposition, much stronger feet and sharp talons. In one case, a colony of griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) was exceptionally able to displace a pair golden eagles from a cliff where they were trying nest so they could nest there themselves. On the other hand, a 5-year-old griffon vulture reintroduced into the wild in Bulgaria was thought to have been killed by a golden eagle. The golden eagle is a potential predator of the lammergeier which is often attracted to much the same habitat and prey as the eagle but often feeds largely on bone marrow from carcasses. It has been observed that both golden eagles and lammergeiers will readily pirate food away from each other. In the Southwestern United States, several conflicts between huge California condors and golden eagles have been observed. At carrion, victory during conflicts can <b>go</b> <b>either</b> <b>way</b> apparently. Recent observation have suggested that the critically endangered condors do not seem to actively defend their nesting territories from golden eagles but have been recorded gaining incidental protection from prairie falcons and common ravens, which both aggressively displaced the eagles from their own adjacent territories. The golden eagle is considered an occasional predator of California condors (especially fledglings) but there seems to be {{little in the way of}} eyewitness accounts to confirm this. It is possible that (as in the Bulgarian griffon vultures) the California condors have lost their natural cautiousness around eagles due to having been reintroduced from captivity.|$|E

500|$|Benfica opened April in Vila do Conde with an {{away match}} against Rio Ave on Sunday 4 April. The home team opened the scoring {{in the second}} half and six minutes later Benfica {{equalized}} by Tiago. The game ended with a 1–1 draw, with Camacho admitting the team showed signs of fatigue. This draw also allowed Sporting to regain a six-point lead, with just five match-days to go. On 10 April, Benfica played Paços de Ferreira at home. Nuno Gomes and Geovanni both scored {{in the second half}} to give Benfica a 2–1 win. A week later Benfica won their second game in a row, 3–0 away at Braga. Miguel scored his first of the season while Sokota and Simão made it 3–0 by the half-hour point. The win, Benfica's largest there since 1989-90, helped them reduce the gap to second place to three points, because of Sporting's loss to Boavista. Camacho attributed the easy win to his team's motivation. Benfica ended April with a home game against Estrela da Amadora. They took an early lead through Nuno Gomes and Sokota scored the second later in the first half. Davide reduced the lead on the 86th minute, but an additional goal by Miguel led to a 3–1 win that put Benfica in second place in the league table, after catching up to Sporting. Camacho liked the win but not the performance, saying: [...] "We lacked sharpness and played on a slow pace."

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{formidable}} raptorial birds that the golden eagle co-exist with are the large northern Haliaeetus sea or fish eagles. Two species, the white-tailed eagle and the bald eagle, overlap in distribution frequently with golden eagles. Both are marginally heavier on average than the golden, especially the white-tailed eagle, which tends to have a slightly longer wingspan as well. There are many differences in the dietary biology of these species as they primarily eat fish, occasionally supplemented by water birds or other semi-aquatic prey, and obtain more of their food via scavenging of dead or injured animals or via kleptoparasitism than golden eagles do. They also prefer nesting in large trees by the shore of a body of water, often in lowland areas, {{quite different from the}} upland, often mountainous nesting habitat preferred by golden eagles. However, conflicts between the great eagles do occur, especially at carrion or kills. In most cases, the golden eagle is reportedly dominant over white-tailed eagles at food, reportedly being more aggressive and a more agile and swift flier. However, in some cases, white-tailed eagles have dominated golden eagles at carrion or kills. Competitions between golden and bald eagles in North America can reportedly <b>go</b> <b>either</b> <b>way,</b> depending on the size and disposition of the eagles involved. In Arizona, bald eagles were successful in 25% of attempts to rob golden eagles of their prey. Conflicts between white-tailed eagles and golden eagles over nesting sites occur with some frequency in some areas, but are unknown in other areas. In one instance in Norway, a pair of golden eagles harassed a newly formed pair of white-tailed eagles so persistently that the white-tails abandoned their nesting attempt. This relationship between the two eagle species is particularly aggressive in Scotland where the white-tailed eagle has been reintroduced recently. In the Scottish Highlands, a white-tailed eagle was found dead with talon piercings in its skull likely from a female golden eagle it had been interacting with the previous day. There are at least two known instances of Scottish white-tailed eagles fiercely attacking golden eagles in apparent territorial bouts, in one instance pulling the golden down into shallow coastal waters to drown. White-tailed eagles are able to survive on a great breadth of food and have longer guts so can live on less food for a longer time than golden eagles. Thus, the white-tailed may locally outcompete the golden eagle in terms of populating a given area. In North America, few such contentious relations have been reported between bald and golden eagles but golden eagles were reported to avoid the vicinity of active bald eagle nests. Even in areas where conflicts between white-tailed and golden eagles do occur it is thought that, since the species are very different in their preferred foods and nesting sites, they do not adversely affect the other at a population level. A much more passive interspecies guild of eagles have been observed in a wooded area of Kazakhstan, consisting of white-tailed, eastern imperial and golden eagle. This guild was seen to freely use abandoned nests built by the other two species. Unlike in Scotland and Norway (or in a guild of Buteos in the American Midwest), no aggression or conflicts were reported between the three large eagle species even though they sometimes nested within [...] of one another. All observed conflicts in the Kazakhstani woods were amongst others of their own species. On the Scottish Isle of Mull, golden and white-tailed eagles also nested in close proximity without any observed aggressive encounters. The Steller's sea eagle co-exists with golden eagles in coastal Japan and Russia. This species is the heaviest living eagle and may weigh twice as much as the small-bodied Japanese golden eagles. Occasionally, both golden and white-tailed eagles join Steller's sea eagles to feed on fish caught along ice floes in the Sea of Okhotsk. The Steller's, being more aggressive in disposition than its bald and white-tailed cousins, appears dominant over golden eagles here and has been photographed repeatedly displacing them from fish. On the other hand, the Japanese golden eagle is no less aggressive than other golden eagles and, in at least one case, was videotaped dominating the bigger sea eagle in a fight over fish. The smaller Pallas's sea eagle (Haliaeetus leucoryphus) also overlaps in range with golden eagles but there is no published information on their relationship.|$|E
