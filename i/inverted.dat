Its layout was {{conceived}} and designed by John Wardley and then built by Bolliger & Mabillard with Werner Stengel providing the layout calculations, the same Swiss firm that built the related Nemesis <b>inverted</b> roller coaster at Alton Towers. As a result, Nemesis and Nemesis Inferno are often compared.|$|E
5|$|Raptor is a steel <b>inverted</b> {{roller coaster}} {{designed}} by Bolliger & Mabillard at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, United States. When built in 1994, it broke many records and held many firsts when it opened. Instead {{of having a}} short layout designed {{to fit into a}} compact area like , Raptor was designed with a larger, 3,790-foot (1,160m) layout, making it the tallest, fastest and longest <b>inverted</b> roller coaster in the world when it opened. It features six inversions, including a cobra roll, a first for <b>inverted</b> roller coasters. At its opening, it was the largest investment in Cedar Point history. The ride is themed as a bird of prey.|$|E

30|$|The {{advance rate}} of the <b>invert</b> {{installation}} {{is the most important}} in the tunnel construction, as it affects greatly the construction of other working procedure such as excavation advance rate, drainage system, and lining.

In addition, with the increase of railway speed and tunnel section area, higher construction quality of tunnels is required in order to assure the tunnel quality and safety.
