5|$|King {{shows how}} enslaved {{children}} were educated for survival and resistance. This education was usually informal and parental and {{taught how to}} deal with slaveowners and their abuse. King also named literacy and religion's role in their education. <b>Kids</b> <b>were</b> taught mutual cooperation as a virtue between slaves. Few slaves had formal education and those who did were artisans. Those educated or given religious training were only by the fortune of their owner's interests. King's stories tell of children in domestic, farm, and industrial work, who spent their free time in celebrations, dances, games, folk rituals, and hunting.|$|E

5|$|Despite 1980's playoff defeat, the Browns {{were widely}} {{expected}} to be even better the following year. But 1981 came {{with none of the}} comebacks or late-game magic the Kardiac <b>Kids</b> <b>were</b> known for. Several games were close, but most were losses. Sipe threw only 17 touchdowns and was intercepted 25 times. The team finished 5–11. The 1982 NFL strike, which began in September and lasted until mid-November, shortened the regular season the following year to nine games. Coming off a poor year, Sipe split starts with his backup, Paul McDonald, and neither was able to bring back the old Kardiac Kids spark. The team ended with a 4–5 record, which qualified for an expanded Super Bowl playoff tournament created to accommodate the shorter season. The Browns faced the Raiders in a rematch of 1980's playoff thriller. This time, though, McDonald was the starter and the ending was far from tense. The Raiders won 27–10.|$|E

40|$|In {{a family}} context with {{endogenous}} timing, multiple public goods and alternative parental instruments, {{we show that}} the optimal timing for the sequential-action game played by rotten kids and a parent depends crucially on whether the <b>kids</b> <b>are</b> homogeneous or heterogeneous. For homogeneous kids, the rotten kid theorem holds irrespective of the parental policy instrument, implying that it is optimal to let the <b>kids</b> to <b>be</b> action leaders. If the <b>kids</b> <b>are</b> heterogeneous, however, parental leadership yields a first best outcome and, hence, it is optimal whenever the <b>kids</b> <b>are</b> economically dependent and agree on the tradeoff between public goods...|$|R
