50|$|On 27 September 1987, during Operation Moduler, two MiG-23 pilots {{surprised}} {{a pair of}} Mirages {{and fired}} missiles: Alberto Ley Rivas engaged a Mirage flown by Capt Arthur Douglas Piercy {{with a pair of}} R-23Rs (some sources say a R-60), while the other Cuban pilot fired a single R-60 at a Mirage flown by Captain Carlo Gagiano. Although the missiles homed on the Mirages, only one R-23R exploded close enough to cause damage to the landing hydraulics of Capt Piercy's Mirage (and, according to some accounts, the aircraft's drag chute). The damage likely contributed to the Mirage veering off the runway on landing, after which the nose gear collapsed. The nose hit the ground so hard that Piercy's ejection seat fired. As a result of this <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> <b>ejection,</b> Piercy was paralyzed. The aircraft was written off, but {{a large portion of the}} airframe and components were used to repair another accident damaged Mirage F-1 and return it to service. In total, the Cubans claim 6 air victories MiG-23 (1 destroyed, 1 damaged and 4 were unconfirmed).|$|E
2500|$|The first {{ejection}} seat fitted to early F-106s was {{a variation of}} the seat used by the F-102 and was called the Weber interim seat. It was a catapult seat which used an explosive charge to propel it clear of the aircraft. This seat was not a zero-zero seat and was inadequate for ejections at supersonic speeds as well as <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> <b>ejections</b> and ejections at speeds below [...] and [...] The second seat that replaced the Weber interim seat was the Convair/ICESC (Industry Crew Escape System Committee) Supersonic Rotational B-seat, called the supersonic [...] "bobsled", hence the B designation. It was designed with supersonic ejection as the primary criterion since the F-106 was capable of Mach-2 performance. Fighter pilots viewed high speed ejections as the most important. Seat designers viewed an ejection at low altitude and slow speed as the most likely possibility. The ejection sequence with the B-seat was quite complicated and there were some unsuccessful ejections that resulted in pilot fatalities. The third seat, that replaced the Convair B-seat, was the Weber Zero-Zero ROCAT (for ROcket CATapult) seat. Weber Aircraft Corporation designed a [...] "zero-zero" [...] seat to operate at up to [...] High-altitude supersonic ejections were rare and ejections at relatively low altitudes and low speeds were more likely. The Weber “zero-zero” seat was satisfactory and was retrofitted to the F-106 after 1965.|$|R

40|$|<b>Ground</b> <b>level</b> ozone is a {{secondary}} pollutant resulting from photochemical reaction {{of a variety}} of natural and anthropogenic precursor mainly volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Under favourable meteorological conditions, ozone may accumulate in the atmosphere and reach a high concentration level that can impose adverse effects on human health and ecosystem. The overall objective of the study is to evaluate the <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> ozone time series concentrations for three years period (From 18 th June 2009 to 6 th June 2011) in Rwanda with focus on Kigali city as it has an increasing number of vehicles and many industries which are the major potential sources of <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> ozone sources in Kigali City.  We have gathered the data from the database air monitoring machine about the <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> ozone concentration located in Kigali at the college of science and technology of University of Rwanda laboratory and the weather information from Rwanda Meteorological Services were used to for the discussion of the ozone data.

40|$|Abstract: Researchers {{studying}} {{climate change}} have used historical tide gauge measurements {{from all over}} the world to investigate the changes in sea level that have occurred over the last century or so. However, such estimates are a combination of any true sea level variations and any changes in <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> at the specific tide gauge. For a tide gauge record to be used to determine the climate related component of changes in sea level it is necessary to correct for any changes in <b>ground</b> <b>level.</b> The development of geodetic techniques for monitoring changes in <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> at British tide gauges has been on-going at the IESSG and POL since 1990, based on research funded by both Defra and the Environment Agency. Since 1996, this research has focused on the establishment of continuous GPS (CGPS) stations and the use of absolute gravimetry (AG), as independent geodetic techniques for measuring changes in <b>ground</b> <b>level.</b> This paper details the results of Defra/EA R&D project FD 2319, which is part of the Risk Evaluation and Understanding of Uncertainty Theme. The paper shows how CGPS and AG have been used on a national scale to monitor changes in <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> at tide gauges and obtain estimates of changes in sea level, decoupled from changes in <b>ground</b> <b>level...</b>|$|R
