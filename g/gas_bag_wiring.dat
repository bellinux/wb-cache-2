30|$|The <b>gas</b> <b>bag</b> is {{composed}} of gas core, surface tension reducing membrane, high viscosity layer and high viscosity layer fixing membrane. The strength of <b>gas</b> <b>bag</b> increases under the support of high viscosity layer. There is fuzzy-ball under the interaction between compatibility enhancing membrane and concentration transition layer of polymer and surfactant. The binding force between the fuzzy-ball and <b>gas</b> <b>bag</b> is so weak that the fuzzy-ball can depart from the <b>gas</b> <b>bag</b> {{and go into the}} continuous phase on the condition of shearing action. Because of <b>gas</b> <b>bag</b> and fuzzy-ball combination and separation in different environments, the new treatment fluid has unique strong shear thinning and blocking feature.|$|R

2500|$|The National Race of 1928, held on May 30 in Pittsburgh, {{turned out}} a disaster. Lightning strikes downed three aircraft, {{including}} Van Orman's. A direct thunderbolt killed Morton instantly and ignited hydrogen in the <b>gas</b> <b>bag.</b> The balloon's basket fell from three thousand feet, {{supported by a}} [...] "parachute" [...] of what remained of its <b>gas</b> <b>bag.</b> Van Orman, unconscious in his basket, survived the impact without serious injuries.|$|R
50|$|Jones and Walker reluctantly {{travel to}} the church hall with a giant gas-bag on the roof. Jones' bayonet accidentally {{punctures}} the gas supply pipe and Jones and Walker succumb to the gas. When they recover, they learn that the <b>gas</b> <b>bag</b> is nearly empty. They reach the church hall to find it empty except for Frazer, who tells them that everyone's already at the practice. Frazer decides to use the Vicar's gas fire to refill the <b>gas</b> <b>bag.</b> The Vicar interrupts, but Frazer passes it off as filling the Vicar's gas fire.|$|R

50|$|A {{semi-rigid}} airship has a deflatable <b>gas</b> <b>bag</b> like a non-rigid {{but with a}} supporting structure to help it hold its shape while aloft. The first practical airship, the Santos-Dumont No.6 was a semi-rigid.|$|R
50|$|A {{rigid airship}} has an outer {{framework}} or skin surrounding the lifting <b>gas</b> <b>bags</b> inside it, The outer envelope keeps its shape {{even if the}} gasbags are deflated. The great Zeppelin airships {{of the twentieth century}} were rigid types.|$|R
5000|$|Daily feedstock: 70 - 100 kg kitchen waste. Daily biogas {{production}} about 7 cubic meters. The excess biogas {{that is not}} consumed {{is stored}} in a <b>gas</b> <b>bag.</b> Biogas is used to replace LPG in the restaurant and private houses.|$|R
50|$|An airship or {{dirigible}} balloon {{is a type}} of aerostat or {{lighter-than-air aircraft}} that can navigate through the air under its own power. Aerostats gain their lift from large <b>gas</b> <b>bags</b> filled with a lifting gas that is less dense than the surrounding air.|$|R
5000|$|The {{envelope}} of an airship may form a single <b>gas</b> <b>bag,</b> or may contain {{a number of}} internal gas-filled cells. An airship also has engines, crew, and optionally also payload accommodation, typically housed {{in one or more}} [...] "gondolas" [...] suspended below the envelope.|$|R
60|$|Probably {{a friend}} of Lady Frensham's, he thought. Still--the idea of Zeppelins over London did seem rather ridiculous to Mr. Britling. He would not {{have liked to have}} been caught talking of it himself.... There never had been Zeppelins over London. They were <b>gas</b> <b>bags....</b>|$|R
50|$|Fins at the rear, {{together}} with propulsion, acts as rear ailerons on aircraft. They allow {{of the envelope}} stabilise the airship, allowing it to fly straight. On some designs (in particular non rigid) these fins are themselves part of a <b>gas</b> <b>bag</b> and gain their shape only when inflated.|$|R
50|$|Cinéorama {{consisted}} of 10 synchronized 70 mm movie projectors, projecting onto 10 9x9 metre screens {{arranged in a}} full 360° circle around the viewing platform. The platform was a large balloon basket, capable of holding 200 viewers, with rigging, ballast, and {{the lower part of}} a huge <b>gas</b> <b>bag.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Hindenburg had a {{duralumin}} structure, incorporating 15 Ferris wheel-like main ring bulkheads {{along its}} length, with 16 cotton <b>gas</b> <b>bags</b> fitted between them. The bulkheads were braced {{to each other}} by longitudinal girders placed around their circumferences. The airship's outer skin was of cotton doped {{with a mixture of}} reflective materials intended to protect the <b>gas</b> <b>bags</b> within from radiation, both ultraviolet (which would damage them) and infrared (which might cause them to overheat). The gas cells were made by a new method pioneered by Goodyear using multiple layers of gelatinized latex rather than the previous goldbeater's skins. [...] In 1931 the Zeppelin Company purchased [...] of duralumin salvaged from the wreckage of the October 1930 crash of the British airship R101, which might have been re-cast and used in the construction of Hindenburg.|$|R
5000|$|Large {{quantities}} of goldbeater's skin {{were used to}} make the <b>gas</b> <b>bags</b> of early balloons created by the Royal Engineers at Chatham, Kent starting in 1881-82 culminating in 1883 with [...] "The Heron", of 10,000 cu ft capacity. The method of preparing and making gas-tight joins in the skins was known only to a family from Alsatia called Weinling who were employed by the RE for many years. The British had a monopoly on the technique until around 1912 when the Germans adopted the material for the internal <b>gas</b> <b>bags</b> of the [...] "Zeppelin" [...] rigid airships, exhausting the available supply: about 200,000 sheets were used for a typical World War I Zeppelin, while the USS Shenandoah needed 750,000 sheets. The sheets were joined together and folded into impermeable layers.|$|R
5000|$|In 1785 Pilâtre de Rozier {{took off}} {{in an attempt to}} fly across the Channel, but shortly into the flight the {{hydrogen}} <b>gas</b> <b>bag</b> caught fire and de Rozier did not survive the ensuing accident. This earned de Rozier the title [...] "The First to Fly and the First to Die".|$|R
50|$|Although {{balloons}} were occasionally {{shot down}} by small-arms fire, generally {{it was difficult to}} shoot down a balloon with solid bullets, particularly at the distances and altitude involved. Ordinary bullets would pass relatively harmlessly through the hydrogen <b>gas</b> <b>bag,</b> merely holing the fabric. Hits on the wicker car could however kill the observer.|$|R
5000|$|Problems arose during gas-filling: on inflation, the {{framework}} collapsed. Schwarz apparently intended the metal skin {{to contain the}} gas directly without internal <b>gas</b> <b>bags.</b> The Russian engineer Kowanko {{pointed out that the}} lack of a ballonet would cause stresses on the skin during ascent and descent. Also, the skin was not airtight, ...|$|R
50|$|A {{rigid airship}} has a rigid {{framework}} covered by an outer skin or envelope. The interior contains {{one or more}} <b>gas</b> <b>bags,</b> cells or balloons to provide lift. Rigid airships are typically unpressurised and {{can be made to}} virtually any size. Most, but not all, of the German Zeppelin airships have been of this type.|$|R
5000|$|Buoyancy {{control is}} managed by pumping helium {{gas from the}} {{internal}} <b>gas</b> <b>bag</b> and compressing it into a storage cell, the reduction in lifting volume leading {{to a loss of}} buoyancy. The system can vary the airship's lift by 3,000-4,000 lb. The manufacturer uses the phrase [...] "Control Of Static Heaviness" [...] for this technology.|$|R
50|$|One of {{his early}} {{interests}} while still at Sées was in the newly developing science of aeronautics. He made at least one hot air balloon which he flew in the public square. He contributed to {{the improvement of the}} production of hydrogen gas, as well as the treatment of the <b>gas</b> <b>bag</b> of the balloon itself.|$|R
50|$|In 1916, the British {{modified}} a small SS class airship for {{the purpose}} of night-time reconnaissance over German lines on the Western Front. Fitted with a silenced engine and a black <b>gas</b> <b>bag,</b> the craft was both invisible and inaudible from the ground but several night-time flights over German-held territory produced little useful intelligence and the idea was dropped.|$|R
25|$|Jacques Charles {{designed}} the hydrogen balloon and the Robert brothers invented the methodology for constructing the lightweight, airtight <b>gas</b> <b>bag.</b> They dissolved rubber {{in a solution}} of turpentine and varnished the sheets of silk that were stitched together to make the main envelope. They used alternate strips of red and white silk, but the discolouration of the varnishing/rubberising process left a red and yellow result.|$|R
50|$|Jacques Charles {{designed}} the balloon, and the Robert brothers constructed a lightweight, airtight <b>gas</b> <b>bag.</b> Barthélémy Faujas de Saint-Fond organized a crowd-funded subscription {{to finance the}} brothers' project. The Roberts dissolved rubber in a solution of turpentine, with which they varnished stitched-together sheets of silk, to make the main envelope. They used alternating strips of red and white silk, but the rubberising varnish yellowed the white silk.|$|R

5000|$|Ambient {{media are}} out-of-home {{products}} and services determined by some as non-traditional or alternative media. Examples are messages {{on the backs of}} car park receipts, on hanging straps in railway carriages, posters inside sports club locker rooms and on the handles of supermarket trolleys. It also includes such techniques as [...] on the sides of buildings, or slogans on the <b>gas</b> <b>bags</b> of hot air balloons.|$|R
50|$|While {{elevators}} and swivelling propellers provide {{fine control}} of altitude, larger changes of height {{used to be}} controlled by either venting gas to lose altitude or dropping ballast to gain altitude. Large airships typically carried several water tanks fore and aft, allowing them to adjust longitudinal trim as well as height. Some modern designs instead pump lifting gas between the <b>gas</b> <b>bags</b> and storage cylinders.|$|R

60|$|The broad {{tires of}} these unique fliers are but {{rubber-like}} <b>gas</b> <b>bags</b> {{filled with the}} eighth Barsoomian ray, or ray of propulsion--that remarkable discovery of the Martians that has made possible the great fleets of mighty airships that render the red man of the outer world supreme. It is this ray which propels the inherent or reflected light of the planet off into space, and when confined gives to the Martian craft their airy buoyancy.|$|R
50|$|Ritchel {{designed}} and built a small, one-man dirigible powered by a hand crank. The aircraft consisted of a brass frame put together at Folansbee Machine Shop in Bridgeport, Connecticut. The frame was hung beneath a cylindrical, rubber <b>gas</b> <b>bag</b> manufactured by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company in Naugatuck. A small propeller drove the craft and could be moved left and right for turning. The craft could reach a height of 200 ft.|$|R

25|$|By {{the end of}} 1917, despite {{flying on}} a quiet sector, he had six {{victories}} to his credit—two planes and four observation balloons—and was transferred to Jasta 13 on the Western Front. On 21 February 1918, he took up his balloon busting again, downing a <b>gas</b> <b>bag.</b> By {{the time he left}} Jasta 13 at the end of April, he was a double ace. His six victories over balloons made him an ace on them alone.|$|R
50|$|A {{metal-clad}} airship has a {{very thin}} metal envelope, rather than the usual fabric. The shell may be either internally braced or monocoque as in the ZMC-2 which flew {{many times in the}} 1920s, the only example ever to do so. The shell may be gas-tight as in a non-rigid blimp, or the design may employ internal <b>gas</b> <b>bags</b> as in a rigid airship. Compared to a fabric envelope the metal cladding is expected to be more durable.|$|R
