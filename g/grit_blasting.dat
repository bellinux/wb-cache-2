5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} arc welding, {{because it}} affords {{greater control over}} the weld area than other welding processes, can produce high-quality welds when performed by skilled operators. Maximum weld quality is assured by maintaining cleanliness—all equipment and materials used must be free from oil, moisture, dirt and other impurities, as these cause weld porosity and consequently a decrease in weld strength and quality. To remove oil and grease, alcohol or similar commercial solvents may be used, while a stainless steel wire brush or chemical process can remove oxides from the surfaces of metals like aluminum. Rust on steels can be removed by first <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> the surface and then using a wire brush to remove any embedded grit. These steps are especially important when negative polarity direct current is used, because such a power supply provides no cleaning during the welding process, unlike positive polarity direct current or alternating current. To maintain a clean weld pool during welding, the shielding gas flow should be sufficient and consistent so that the gas covers the weld and blocks impurities in the atmosphere. GTAW in windy or drafty environments increases the amount of shielding gas necessary to protect the weld, increasing the cost and making the process unpopular outdoors.|$|E

We attempted {{to improve the}} bone-implant interaction by 1) adding surface micro scale topography by acid etching, and 2) removing surface-adherent pro-inflammatory agents by plasma cleaning. Implant fixation was evaluated by implant osseointegration and biomechanical fixation. The study consisted of two paired animal sub-studies where 10 skeletally mature Labrador dogs were used. <b>Grit</b> <b>blasted</b> titanium alloy implants were inserted press fit in each proximal tibia. In the first study <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> implants were compared with acid etched <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> implants.

40|$|The {{main problem}} facing the {{longevity}} of total joint replacements is wear particle-induced osteolysis, particularly around the acetabular component. Ovine Total Hip Replacement surgery was performed with roughened femoral heads {{in order to enhance}} wear debris generation in vivo. The resistance to aseptic loosening of acetabular components with different surface coatings was investigated. Implants remained in vivo for 1 year. Sheep were {{randomly assigned to one of}} six experimental groups where the acetabular cup was fixed utilising an: (a) cemented polyethylene acetabular cup, (b) metal backed <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> surface, (c) metal backed plasma sprayed titanium porous coating, (d) metal backed sintered beaded coating, (e) Hydroxyapatite (HA) -coated <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> surface (f) and HA-coated porous components. Ground Reaction Force (GRF) was used to asses the functional performance of the implants and data was collected pre-operatively and at 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks post op. Wear debris generated was analysed and radiographs taken prior to preparation of thin sections. Fibrous tissue (FT) thickness and bone contact at 1 mm intervals along the acetabular bone-implant interface was calculated. GRF data demonstrated significant differences between experimental groups. In all groups there was an increase in the function of the hip after surgery and up to 24 weeks but thereafter the function of the group with the <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> surface reduced whereas the function of the other groups did not significantly change. Average wear particles generated were < 1 microm in size. The cemented group demonstrated a significantly thicker average FT layer (2. 69 mm) when compared with all other groups (p< 0. 05 in all cases) except the <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> group (1. 56 mm). HA porous coated cups demonstrated significantly least fibrous tissue adjacent to its interface when compared with all other groups (cemented p< 0. 05, <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> p= 0. 029, porous p< 0. 05, sintered beads p< 0. 05 and HA <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> p< 0. 05). Significantly increased bone contact to HA-coated porous cups (73. 33 %) when compared with all groups was identified except HA-coated <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> cups where no significant difference was demonstrated. Radiographic signs of loosening were visible in all groups except the HA-coated porous group. Results demonstrated that HA porous coated acetabular components significantly enhanced bone ingrowth in the presence of wear particles, preventing their migration and reducing osteolysis.

We hypothesized that mini-implants surface roughness alters the intrinsic biomechanical {{properties of the}} bone integrated to titanium. Materials and Methods: Mini implants and circular discs were made from alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V grade 5. On the basis of surface treatment study was divided into 4 groups: Group 1 : Machined: no surface treatment, Group 2 : Acid etched: with hydrochloric acid, Group 3 : <b>Grit</b> <b>Blasted</b> with alumina and Group 4 : <b>Grit</b> <b>blasted</b> +Acid etched. Surface roughness parameters (mean surface roughness: Ra and Quadratic Average roughness: Rq) of the four discs from each group were measured by the optical profilometer. Contact angle measurement of 3 discs from each group was done with a Goniometer. Contact angle of liquids with different hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity were measured. 128 mini implants, differing in surface treatment, were placed into the tibias and femurs of 8 adult male New Zealand white rabbits. Biomechanical properties (Removal torque and hardness) measurements and histomorphometric observations were measured. Results: Ra and Rq of groups were: Machined (1. 17 ± 0. 11, 2. 59 ± 0. 09) Acid etched (1. 82 ± 0. 04, 3. 17 ± 0. 13), <b>Grit</b> <b>blasted</b> (4. 83 ± 0. 23, 7. 04 ± 0. 08), <b>Grit</b> <b>blasted</b> + Acid etched (3. 64 ± 0. 03, 4. 95 ± 0. 04) respectively. Group 4 had significantly (p= 0. 000) lower Ra and Rq than Group 3. The interaction between the groups and liquid was significant. Group 4 had significantly lower contact angle measurements (40. 4 °, 26. 9 °), both for blood and NaCl {{when compared to other}} three groups (p≤ 0. 01). Group 4 had significantly higher torque than Group 3 (Tibia: 13. 67 > 9. 07 N-cm; Femur: 18. 21 > 14. 12 N-cm), Group 4 (Tibia: 13. 67 > 9. 78 N-cm; Femur: 18. 21 > 12. 87 N-cm), and machined (Tibia: 13. 67 > 4. 08 N-cm; Femur: 18. 21 > 6. 49 N-cm). SEM analysis reveals significantly more bone implant gap in machined implant surfaces than treated implant surfaces. Bone to implant contact had significantly higher values for treated mini implant surface than machined surface. Hardness of the bone near the implant bone interface is 20 to 25 % less hard than bone 1 mm away from it in both Femur and Tibia.

50|$|The {{cleaning}} {{performance of}} the bristle blasting process {{is a consequence of}} synchronized impact of the bristle tips onto the target surface. The tool head with the bristle belt rotates at approximately 2,500 rpm. A so-called 'accelerator bar' detains the bristle tips and by releasing them increases their kinetic energy with which they strike the surface. Immediately after the bristles strike the corroded steel surface, they retract (rebound) from the surface ('single-impact'), which results in corrosion removal and a micro-identation that exposes the sheer metallic surface. The multitude of such primary impact craters generates a texture and surface which in visual cleanliness and roughness (anchor profile) mimics those obtained by <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> processes. The cleaned and coarsened surface is deemed favorable for the subsequent application and adhesion of protective films and industrial coatings.|$|E

The adhesive bond strength was assessed by testing joints in tension and shear.

This study was performed to assess the effects of implant surface fabrications and coatings on new bone growth on and in implant surface and on mechanical stability. The study also examines the effects of gap on bone healing in bone-implant interface and exogenous mechanical stimuli on bone growth and mechanical stability. And, lastly, the development of a sheep model for implant research was also undertaken. Materials & Methods: Four types of implants were tested: plasma sprayed porous surface titanium implant with electrochemically deposited 20 &# 956;m dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) and without coating (TiPL); and <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> titanium implants with hydroxyapatite (HA) and without coating (TiGB). Implants were inserted into cancellous and cortical bones with gaps and fits in sheep hind limbs. One group of sheep was treated by dynamic motion therapy (DMT) postoperatively. Specimens were retrieved at five timepoints. Bone-implant mechanical stability was assessed by push-out testing. Bone ongrowth, ingrowth and remodelling were investigated by histology, SEM and BSEM images. Results: Thin electrochemical deposited DCPD coating can improve bone ingrowth in porous surface but cannot improve bone-implant interface mechanical strength. Cortical bone has better ingrowth ability than cancellous bone. Plasma sprayed porous surface has higher bone ongrowth rate and mechanical stability than <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> surface. Failure mode in TiPL based implants (including TiPL and DCPD) is through newly formed surrounding bone, while that in TiGB based implants (including TiGB and HA) is through bone-implant interface, HA coating or coating-implant interface. HA coating improves bone-implant gap healing better than <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> surface. Tighter bone-implant interface leads to earlier healing and remodelling, while a bigger gap results in less bone growth on implant. The current DMT does not enhance bone-implant interface shear strength, but improves toughness and reduces stiffness.

This is known as a fast welding technique in which in the order of seconds a joint can be created by means of fusion bonding of thermoplastics. This study has been focused on an assessment of the power and displacement feedback obtained during welding, the electro-insulating behavior of the created joints and their single lap shear strength & fracture. Both non-hybrid and hybrid joints have been welded. For hybrid welds, both steel and aluminium were used as metallic substrate. For aluminium substrates, the effect of not applying a coating has been evaluated as well. The absence of a coating was found to result in no bond between the applied thermoplastic and pretreated metallic surface. With the applied welding settings, hybrid welds with coated metallic substrates showed to dissipate the same amount of energy as non-hybrid welds, in the order of 700 Joules on average, at a welding time in the order of 0. 5 seconds. The obtained power and displacement feedback during welding showed to be affected by both material choice and the type of adherend in contact with the sonotrode during welding. Welding resulted in an electro-insulating thermoplastic adhesive layer between both adherends for hybrid welds. Welding <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> and coated aluminium samples resulted in an average single lap shear strength (SLSS) of 11 MPa. This was 16. 5 MPa with a coefficient of variation of 2. 2 % for welding with a <b>grit</b> <b>blasted,</b> nitric acid etched and coated aluminium surface. This strength is up to 80 % of a tested adhesive reference. Hybrid welds with coated <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> steel and the used welding settings proved to result in an average SLSS of 8 MPa.

Early (2 min) and late (6 min) times of cementation were considered for two different <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> surface finishes (16 and 60 grit, Ra= 5. 7 or 2. 3 microm).

Early cementing did not increase the debond energy using the in vivo simulated mold. Extensive porosity was found at the interface, and porosity had a strong negative effect on debond energy. When the simpler, rectangular mold was used, early cementing did result in higher debond energies, but few voids were found at the interface.

When the variation of structural fraction to cell motility and growth factor synthesis was investigated, an envelope pattern with an optimum was obtained but this could be exceeded for strong surface modifications and/or for high growth factor concentrations. The model also confirmed that implant bioactive properties should play a limited role to reduce heterogeneity of new-formed tissue. In conclusion, we suggested that our innovative theoretical approach was relevant to investigate implant fixation and could potentially help in reduction of implant revision...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. WC- 12 %Co powders were sprayed by high {{velocity}} oxygen fuel (HVOF) to prepare coatings on carbon steel substrate, which was pretreated by electrospark and grit blast before spraying. The surface coating of WC-Co and the intermediate layer structure were studied by {{scanning electron microscopy}} and X-ray diffraction. The adhesion strength of the coating was measured by a scratching tester. Results show that the roughness value of the <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> and electrospark strengthened surface were 60 ~ 70 µm and 40 ~ 50 µm, respectively. The coating pretreated by grit blast and electrospark was dense and was bonded well with the substrate. The heat affected zone of the grit blasted specimen was larger than that of the electrospark pretreated one. The average adhesion strength of the coating pretreated with <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> and that with eletrospark were 35. 00 N and 12. 48 N, respectively. The reasion of the high adhesion strength of the <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> coating is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{the study}} were to carry out a {{comparison}} of <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> and other surface pretreatment processes and identify the relation between <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> parameters and coating adhesion, because it can be assumed that the adhesion between substrate and coating strongly depends on the physical properties of the substrate surface. By this way, in order to improve the bonding between substrate and coating, it is necessary to study the influence of different surface pre-treatment parameters and to compare different pre-treatment techniques. <b>Grit</b> <b>blasting,</b> water jet blasting and mechanicals processes (milling and grinding) have been studied. In order to compare them, the roughness of the surface, the adhesive straights, the topography, the contact surface and the residual stresses have been the considered parameters to carry out the research. Two different substrates have been studied, AlMg 7 and St_ 42. For <b>grit</b> <b>blasting,</b> five different blasting parameters have been analyzed and combined to obtain reliable results, attack angle, air pressure, lineal velocity, number of passes, and distance between substrate and nozzle. After measuring the obtained values, the most influence parameters were recombined and analyzed to obtain better surface conditions. In the case of mechanicals processes (milling and grinding), the samples were studied for different mechanical parameters, analyzed and compared with the other surface pretreatments in order to obtain the most suitable method. For water jet blasting, eight samples were sent to WLH (University of Hannover) to be treated. To carry out the pretreatment, the velocity of the water jet blasting was modify while the other blasting parameters remained constant, in order to compare the obtained values of roughness, adhesion, activate area and residual stresses for water jet with <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> and mechanical processes. The next conclusions can be assumed: The roughness is not so important than the topography to obtain the best adhesive bonding between the substrate and the coating, and the best bonding was obtained for homogeneous topographies (obtained for water jet blasting and <b>grit</b> <b>blasting).</b> Comparing the surface pretreatments is observed that water jet blasting is the surface pretreatment method which leads to the highest bonding between substrate and coating. It can be assumed that a higher contact surface area leads to a better adhesion between substrate and coating. The residual stresses strongly depend on the surface pretreatment used. <b>Grit</b> <b>blasting</b> leads to the highest compressive stresses while water jet blasting almost does not cause variations and grinding obtains the same values than for a raw surface (untreated surface).

40|$|Present <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> {{technology}} for hull cleaning is very pollutant, environmentally unaffordable, {{and it is}} progressively forbidden in the most environmental countries (mainly north of Europe). At the time being, the above methodology has been partially substituted by ultra highpressure water blasting, however they do not show as good performance as the <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> systems. This paper describes a service robot for hull blasting. The technology we developed consists of the cleaning head, the robot body, the remote control unit and the teleoperation platform. This solution allows a reliable and cost effective operation regarding hull <b>grit</b> <b>blasting,</b> obtaining a high quality surface preparation (SA 2 ½) together with a dramatic reduction of waste and zero emissions to environment. A prototype of the robot has been developed and tested in IZAR shipyards. We presents the functional requirements, system concept and architecture of this robot.

40|$|In {{the present}} work low density poly {{ethylene}} (LDPE) and maleic acid grafted LDPE (LDPE-g-MAc) were pigmented with {{red iron oxide}} at three different concentrations (i. e., 20, 30 and 40 wt%). The pigmented compositions were prepared in extruder and then cryogenically grounded to bring them in powder form. These compositions were applied on <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> mild steel specimen by flame spray technique. Corrosion resistance of red iron oxide based compositions was studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

40|$|In {{material}} bonding, {{the surface}} {{energy of the}} adherend can be an excellent predictor of adhesive bond strength. In this research, {{the use of the}} sessile drop test as a pre-bond inspection tool for bonded composite repairs was investigated. A portable goniometer suitable for a maintenance workshop in the aviation industry was designed and built. Dimethyl sulfoxide and water were used as testing fluids, dispensed in 3 μl quantities. Contact angles were measured using the spherical approximation for a range of surfaces which included samples that had been peel-plied, hand sanded, <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> and contaminated with silicone release agent. The surface energies of the samples were then evaluated using the Owens-Wendt and Girifalco-Good-Fowkes-Young (GGFY) methods. Although the GGFY method successfully distinguished contamination, difficulties arose when evaluating surface roughness. Peel-ply surfaces also had varying contact angles due to irregular droplet shapes. The Owens-Wendt method was also found to be inaccurate with only two test fluids although this is regarded as industry standard, It is for these reasons that traditional surface energy methods were considered impractical for a workshop environment. An alternate measurement parameter considered was the droplet diameter where the same testing fluids were imaged from the top instead. This measurement successfully differentiated contamination and also allowed the abrasion process to be determined. In addition, the degree of abrasion could be determined between <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> and untreated peel-ply surfaces. This test was found to be more accurate than the traditional surface energy techniques and has the potential to form part of a pre-bond surface certification process for bonded composite repairs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAISI 316 LVM {{stainless}} steel type considered in ASTM F 138 and F 139 standards for implant devices is widely used, in particular for orthopedic surgery, because it combines good biofunctionality and acceptable biocompatibility at low costs.

The goal of the present work is to relate the surface roughness parameters with the localized corrosion resistance of AISI 316 LVM {{stainless steel}} <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> for different times and passivated with nitric acid. At intermediate blasting times the roughness parameters attain an extreme value and this surface condition corresponds with the maximum pitting corrosion resistance...|$|R
