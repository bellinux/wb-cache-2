The couple married on July 28, 2007.|$|E
25|$|Younis is {{regarded}} as one of the best players of spin bowling in the world, being particularly strong on the leg side. His favourite and trademark shot is the flick, but it has also been his shortcoming, with him being particularly prone to falling lbw during the early stages of his innings. He is also prone to getting <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>knee</b> and driving extravagantly. But this flamboyance is coupled with grit. One of his main weaknesses is playing away from the body, he also has a tendency to leave straight balls, a trait that has been exploited by bowlers in the past, particularly by the Australian attack. Along with Mohammad Yousuf and the now retired Inzamam-ul-Haq, he formed a formidable middle order batting line up for Pakistan.|$|E

40|$|It is {{commonly}} claimed that in France agricultural organizations dominate national preference formation not {{only when it}} comes to domestic agricultural policy, but also with respect to international agricultural policy developed {{in the context of the}} Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT). This paper will take issue with that common claim and will argue that it was not only farm lobby pressure, but instead ideational factors among which French anti-Americanism that had a strong impact on French preference formation with respect to the launching of the GATT Uruguay Round as well as on the French position taking concerning the agricultural chapter in these negotiations. The data analysis in this case study will show that anti-Americanism influenced French preference formation in at least three ways. In the first place, French distrust of the United States, present among both the governing elite and society at large, was one of the reasons of the reserved initial French reaction to the plans for a new GATT Round. If these plans originated from the United States, there had to be a snag somewhere. Secondly, at a more ideational level, meeting the demands of the United States to subject agricultural trade to greater GATT discipline and to introduce a free market system in agricultural trade (under the threat that the United States would otherwise seek bilateral or regional instead of multilateral trade solutions) did not only clash with the French agricultural policy paradigm and her ideas of managed trade, but giving in to the demands was also considered to be inappropriate on the basis of the French image of itself as the leading nation within a strong Europe, negotiating on an equal footing with the United States. Finally, at the political level, both societal actors and government officials successfully tapped into anti-American rhetoric in the preference-formation process when arguing against compromises, by depicting these compromises as carrying a clear United States mark, and by arguing that accepting these compromises would mean going <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>ones</b> <b>knees</b> for the United States...|$|R

25|$|This shot, though risky in the execution, has the {{advantage}} of being aimed at a section of the field where a fielder is rarely placed – particularly in Twenty20 and One Day International cricket where the number of outfielders is limited. However the Marillier shot is played over the batsman's shoulder to fine leg, but the basis of the scoop stroke is for the batsman to go <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>knee</b> to a good length or slightly short-of-length delivery off a fast or medium paced bowler and scoop the ball over the head of the wicket-keeper. The scoop shot is a risky shot to play as the improper execution of this shot may lead to a catch being offered. One famous example of the scoop backfiring is of the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 Final when Pakistan were 152/9 and needed 6 runs off 4 balls and Misbah-ul-Haq improperly executed this shot resulting in a catch to Sreesanth.|$|E

When the children had finished their story, he beckoned her out of the room, promising them that he would not keep her long.|$|R

2500|$|Wallenda did not falter or totter in the {{slightest}} during his walk, nor did he stop to do any extra tricks during the walk (as he often does). Talking to ABC reporters live, {{as he entered the}} final phase of the trip he admitted, [...] "I'm drained... My hands are going numb. I feel like I'm getting weak." [...] Later he said, [...] "my forearm just started to cramp worse than it ever has been before", attributing it the stress of the day. Near the end, he stopped, got <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>knee,</b> and blew a kiss to the crowd. He got up, pumped his fist, and ran the final few steps. He completed the crossing at 10:41p.m. EDT, 25 minutes after he started. In so doing, Wallenda became the first person to cross directly over Niagara Falls on a high-wire. In the 1800s, a few tightrope walkers had crossed over the Niagara Gorge down river, but none had ever crossed directly over the Falls. He also set the world record for longest walk over a waterfall. [...] Prior to Wallenda, the last person to cross the river on tightrope was James Hardy in 1896. According to Wallenda, it was the longest unsupported tightrope walk in history. [...] He carried his passport on the trip and was required to present it to Canadian border guards waiting for him upon his arrival on the Canadian side of the falls.|$|E
2500|$|The first Australian wicket fell {{before a}} run {{was on the}} board {{for the third time}} in the series, but it was Ken Archer who succumbed to Alec Bedser when he glanced the third ball of the day to Denis Compton at short fine-leg, though he hung about the wicket even after he was given out by Umpire Barlow. Having livened up the crowd the bowlers had a tough day as the Adelaide Oval was up to its usual standards. Arthur Morris batted a very careful and {{composed}} innings, the highest of his Test career as he laid his reputation as [...] "Bedser's Bunny" [...] to rest. He made 206 out of Australia's 371 before he was the last man out, spending 7 hours and 42minutes at the crease and striking 23 boundaries in the process. He passed 2,000 runs in Tests and made his seventh Ashes century in four years, overtaking Victor Trumper and Bill Woodfull placing him behind only Sir Donald Bradman on the list of Australian century-makers against England. No other Australian batsman made 50, but he added 95 runs for the second wicket with Lindsay Hassett (43), 110 for the third wicket with Neil Harvey (44) and 76 for the fourth wicket with Keith Miller (44). Thereafter wickets fell sharply, the last five falling for 14 runs, and the innings ended when he was bowled by Roy Tattersall (3/95). The young Lancashire off-spinner had an impressive debut which justified his selection even though he had to borrow E.W. Swanton's boots because his feet had swollen on the flight. He began by conceding only 5 runs from his first 6 overs and spun the ball so much that it floated across the wicket before turning on the unhelpful wicket. He dismissed fellow debutant Jim Burke with a ball that he bowled at the leg stump so that Burke went <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>knee</b> to sweep it, but it floated over the wicket and knocked over the off-stump. He also bowled Don Tallon, getting his three wickets without any help from the fielders. Alec Bedser returned figures of 3/74, but Hassett protected Morris early in his innings and Miller hit his first over of the second day for 15. Doug Wright took 4/99 and only Morris, a noted player of spinners, was able to master him, but John Warr (0/63) could still not take a wicket.|$|E
