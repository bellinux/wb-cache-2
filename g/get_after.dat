25|$|I scored 114 in {{the first}} innings and 97 in the second. I will not claim that the first innings was a {{particularly}} good one, as it took me almost seven hours. But neither would I pretend {{that it was not}} immensely satisfying. I took ball after ball, blow after blow on that improvised body-shield but was able to stand firm...The second innings was the best I ever played. From the firm foundations of real confidence I was able to <b>get</b> <b>after</b> the bowling and repay Hall, particularly, for some of the anguish he had caused me. I had one glorious hour against him...I hooked him twice in a row and reduced him to the kind of despair which, but a fortnight earlier, had been exclusively mine.|$|E
25|$|Accustomed {{to writing}} the scripts for movies, Gowariker {{said that he}} found it {{difficult}} to write the script for Everest. Typically, {{in the case of a}} soap opera, the story is not written entirely prior to release. Rather, it is written as the soap opera goes on, analysing various factors such as the TRPs (television rating points) and the audience feedback. Everest, however, was not written this way. Gowariker has also said that it was while writing the story that he realised the self-satisfaction that people <b>get</b> <b>after</b> climbing Mount Everest. After finishing writing the story, he realised not only that he wanted to produce the show, but also that he also needed experts to direct it. Gowariker said in a group interview that through Everest he would also be addressing the girl child issue.|$|E

2500|$|The Indians {{were thus}} {{left with a}} target of 230, and there were still ten overs left in the day, but the Indian openers survived all of these overs without any scare.
