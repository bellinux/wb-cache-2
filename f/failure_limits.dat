For two plasma-sprayed tungsten mock-ups, <b>failure</b> <b>limits</b> were reached at 6. 5 MW/m(2). But from the test results, it can be concluded that these <b>failure</b> <b>limits</b> could be increased by improvement of the production methods. Vertical displacement event (VDE) simulation experiments followed by a thermal fatigue test were performed on a tungsten macrobrush mock-up.

A Digital Image Correlation (DIC) (non contact, full-field, surface displacement/strain measurement technique) was developed on purpose for accurately capturing localized or non-uniform stress distributions in asphalt mixtures and {{as a tool for}} detecting first fracture. The experimental analysis of asphalt mixture cracking behavior was based on the “HMA Fracture Mechanics” visco-elastic crack growth law (Zhang et al. 2001; Roque et al.; 2002). Investigation of the asphalt cracking mechanism and identification of fundamental tensile <b>failure</b> <b>limits</b> were achieved performing multiple laboratory test configurations, namely the Superpave Indirect Tensile Test (IDT), the Semi-Circular Bending Test (SCB) and the Three Point Bending Beam Test (3 PB). Both unmodified and polymer modified mixtures were tested. The results presented herein illustrate that the DIC method could be used to reliably determine asphalt tensile <b>failure</b> <b>limits</b> at first fracture. It was found that these <b>failure</b> <b>limits</b> are independent of the specimen geometry and of the test configuration. Also, importantly the tensile <b>failure</b> <b>limits</b> were shown to be sensitive to both presence and level of polymer modification. It is also shown that first fracture and crack growth in asphalt mixtures can be predicted effectively using a Displacement Discontinuity (DD) boundary element method, for various different boundary condition problems, and not just for the calibrated laboratory test conditions. The numerical simulations and the DIC results presented show that significant damage, stress redistribution and other changes following initial fracture make the analysis at peak load difficult to interpret meaningfully. The effect of polymer modification on crack localization was also investigated through the use of horizontal full-field strain maps obtained from the DIC. It was found that polymer modified mixtures exhibit high strains only up to the location of impending fracture, while unmodified mixtures exhibit highly distributed damage in both the critical area and around the point of fracture...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Examining {{existing}} {{experimental results}} for shallow rigid foundations subjected to vertical centric load (N), accompanied or {{not with a}} bending moment (M), two main non-linear mechanisms governing the cyclic response of the soil-foundation system can be distinguished: foundation uplift and soil yielding. A soil-foundation <b>failure</b> <b>limit,</b> {{is defined as a}} domain of resistance in the two dimensional (2 D) load space (N, M) inside of which lie all the admissible combinations of loads; these latter correspond to a pure elastic, non-linear elastic or plastic behavior of the soil-foundation system, while the points lying on the <b>failure</b> <b>limit</b> correspond to a combination of loads leading to a failure of the soil-foundation system. In this study, the proposed resistance domain is constructed analytically based on mechanics. Original elastic limit, uplift initiation limit and iso-uplift limits are constructed inside this domain. These limits give a prediction of the mechanisms activated for each combination of loads applied to the foundation. A comparison of the proposed <b>failure</b> <b>limit</b> with experimental tests existing in the literature shows interesting results. Also, the developed uplift initiation limit and iso-uplift curves are confronted with others already proposed in the literature and widely used due to the absence of other alternatives, and remarkable differences are noted, showing evident errors in the past proposals and relevant accuracy for those given in the present work...|$|R

40|$|Residual {{stresses}} are {{mechanical stresses}} in components, which are free from outside forces, moments and temperature gradients. They can considerably influence <b>failure</b> <b>limits</b> since they overimpose with external stresses. Two categories of residual stresses are macro residual stresses and micro residual stresses varying on a microscopic scale. The latter encompasses stresses between different phases of a material and stresses between differently oriented crystallites. The {{aim of the}} thesis is the investigation of microstresses in technical metal alloys after rolling, plastic axial deformation and cyclic loading. A substantial focus is laid on the possibilities to determine the residual stress state in a material with orientation-dependent microstresses. So far different evaluation methods already exist. Each of these procedures is based on restrictive conditions concerning the crystallite coupling, the kind of the residual stress state or on idealized conditions of the investigated material. In recent years a new promising evaluation method has been presented which apart from the macrostress state enables {{the analysis of the}} microstress state {{as a function of the}} crystal orientation. This so called “harmonic method” displays the strain or stress components depending on the crystal orientations by a series of symmetric harmonics. The unknown coefficients are derived with regression analysis from the experimental strain measurements. The generated strain/stress orientation functions result in macroscopic values by averaging over all orientations. So far the procedure has been rarely used in practice. As part of this work it was applied to Cu basis alloys. As comparative evaluation methods an advanced crystallite group method and the relatively simple method of linearization of averaged D(sin²psi) distributions are selected. The methods are applied to experimental data and tested concerning their restrictive conditions. Apart from the direct comparison of the evaluation methods, the sensitivity of the procedures was examined in relation to the inputs, i. e. the size of the measuring expenditure and possible measuring errors. Apart from the macro residual stresses the harmonic method provides the orientation-dependent micro stresses. Thus, a tool is available with which the development of these orientation-dependent micro stresses can be analyzed under plastic deformation. As part of this thesis Cu basis alloys were selected as exemplary material for analysis and examination. Apart from the evaluation of residual stresses the assessment of their influence on the endurance limits of components under static and dynamic loading is of particular interest. The positive and negative effects of macro residual stresses during cyclic loading have already been thoroughly studied. However, only few investigations have been conducted on the behavior and the influence of microstresses during cyclic loading. The microstresses can deviate severely from the macro residual stresses and can reach high absolute values compared to the yield points of the material. With a relaxation during cyclic loading they have rather little impact on <b>failure</b> <b>limits.</b> On the other hand rising or stable high initial values are more likely to influence <b>failure</b> <b>limits.</b> Therefore an examination of the development of the micro residual stresses is necessary and was conducted on a ferrite/austenitic duplex stainless steel with approximately balanced portions of the phases. A pulsating bending load was selected to apply pure tension on one side of the specimen and pure compression on the opposite side. Both phases can be measured well, so that apart form the development of the orientation-dependent microstresses primarily the stresses between the phases could be analyzed. The influence of a high anisotropy was examined with comparative measurements of a brass alloy...|$|E
