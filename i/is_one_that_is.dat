5|$|Damping {{occurs at}} two {{different}} scales, {{with the process}} working more quickly over short ranges than over longer distances. Here, a short length <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> lower than the mean free path of the photons. A long distance <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> greater than the mean free path, if still less than the diffusion length. On the smaller scale, perturbations are damped almost instantaneously. On the larger scale, anisotropies are decreased more slowly, with significant degradation happening within one unit of Hubble time.|$|E

25|$|A {{long bone}} <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{cylindrical}} in shape, being {{longer than it}} is wide. However, the term describes {{the shape of a}} bone, not its size which is relative. Long bones are found in the arms (humerus, ulna, radius) and legs (femur, tibia, fibula), {{as well as in the}} fingers (metacarpals, phalanges) and toes (metatarsals, phalanges). Long bones function as levers; they move when muscles contract.They are responsible for the body's height.|$|E
25|$|There are {{multiple}} ways of considering {{the cause of}} directional selection on this set of foraging behaviors in honey bees. A proximate factor <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> developmental and influential on behavior within the lifetime of an organism. Neurological and developmental differences lead to directional selection {{and changes in the}} set of foraging behaviors between generations of honey bees. Levels of stress as measured by levels of octopamine is one such contributing developmental factor.|$|E
25|$|An abbey church <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> or {{was in the}} past, {{the church}} of a monastic order. Likewise a friary church is the church of an order of friars.

A question then rose of how to accept these people back into the church. Some argued that they should just be allowed back into the church. Others, “Donatists” argued <b>that</b> re-baptism <b>was</b> required. Cyprian of Carthage <b>was</b> <b>one</b> who argued <b>that</b> the lapsed needed to be baptised again. Augustine would argue against rebaptism. Augustine’s position <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> accepted as orthodox.|$|R
25|$|Electoral stasis is a {{condition}} that can arise when an electorate cannot realistically change its political composition, regardless of the swing occurring in a general election. A safe seat in a single member electoral system <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> in electoral stasis. Proportional representation systems, such as STV ballots, can also be in electoral stasis. These “safe seats” can be ignored by political party strategists, who will allocate resources to other electorates.|$|E
25|$|Modern Dutch {{spelling}} still retains many of {{the details}} of the late Middle Dutch system. The distinction between checked and free vowels is important in Dutch spelling. A checked vowel <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> followed by a consonant in the same syllable (the syllable is closed) while a free vowel ends the syllable (the syllable is open). This distinction can apply to pronunciation or spelling independently, but a syllable that is checked in pronunciation will always be checked in spelling as well (except in some unassimilated loanwords).|$|E
25|$|The {{financial}} costs of every {{nuclear power plant}} continues for some time after the facility has finished generating its last useful electricity. Once no longer economically viable, nuclear reactors and uranium enrichment facilities are generally decommissioned, returning the facility and its parts to a safe enough level to be entrusted for other uses, such as greenfield status. After a cooling-off period that may last decades, reactor core materials are dismantled and {{cut into small pieces}} to be packed in containers for interim storage or transmutation experiments. The consensus on how to approach the task <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> relatively inexpensive, but {{it has the potential to}} be hazardous to the natural environment as it presents opportunities for human error, accidents or sabotage.|$|E
