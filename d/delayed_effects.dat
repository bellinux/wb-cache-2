5|$|The {{mechanism}} that {{is thought to}} have a significant influence on <b>delayed</b> <b>effects</b> involves formed blood cells and chemical mediators, which cause brain lipid peroxidation (degradation of unsaturated fatty acids). Carbon monoxide causes endothelial cell and platelet release of nitric oxide, and the formation of oxygen free radicals including peroxynitrite. In the brain this causes further mitochondrial dysfunction, capillary leakage, leukocyte sequestration, and apoptosis. The result of these effects is lipid peroxidation, which causes delayed reversible demyelinization of white matter in the central nervous system known as Grinker myelinopathy, which can lead to edema and necrosis within the brain. This brain damage occurs mainly during the recovery period. This may result in cognitive defects, especially affecting memory and learning, and movement disorders. These disorders are typically related to damage to the cerebral white matter and basal ganglia. Hallmark pathological changes following poisoning are bilateral necrosis of the white matter, globus pallidus, cerebellum, hippocampus and the cerebral cortex.|$|E

The biofuel and food price debate involves wide-ranging views, and is a long-standing, controversial one in the literature. There is disagreement about the significance of the issue, what is causing it, and what can or should be done to remedy the situation. This complexity and uncertainty is due to the large number of impacts and feedback loops that can positively or negatively affect the price system. Moreover, the relative strengths of these positive and negative impacts vary in the short and long terms, and involve <b>delayed</b> <b>effects.</b> The academic side of the debate is also blurred by the use of different economic models and competing forms of statistical analysis.|$|E

40|$|The interstand tension {{coupling}} {{effect and}} strip gauge variation {{passed on to}} next stand with time delay are the main causes for regenerative chatter in tandem rolling mills. To study the effect of different factors on the stability of tandem rolling mills, different models considering different interstand factors were built.

To study the time <b>delay</b> <b>effect</b> as a single factor on the stability of tandem rolling mills, stability charts of the chatter model including the time <b>delay</b> <b>effect</b> and model neglecting the delay time were compared.
