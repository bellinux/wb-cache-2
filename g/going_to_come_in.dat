500|$|In a 2005 {{lecture at}} Harvard after Jackson's trial, Jackson's {{attorney}} Thomas Mesereau said the following about Jordan Chandler: [...] "The prosecutors {{tried to get}} him to show up and he wouldn't. If he had, I had witnesses who were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> and say he told them it never happened and that he would never talk to his parents again for what they made him say. It turned out he'd gone into court and got legal emancipation from his parents." [...] In 2006, Jordan accused Evan of attacking him with a barbell, choking him and spraying his face with Mace. The charges were later dropped. On November 5, 2009, fourteen weeks after Jackson's death, Evan Chandler was found dead following an apparent suicide.|$|E
500|$|The People v. Jackson {{trial began}} in Santa Maria, California, on January 31, 2005. During the trial, the judge allowed {{testimony}} about past allegations, including the 1993 case, to establish whether the defendant had a propensity to commit certain crimes. However, Jordan Chandler {{had left the}} country to avoid testifying. In a lecture at Harvard after the trial, Thomas Mesereau said, [...] "The prosecutors {{tried to get him}} to show up and he wouldn't. If he had, I had witnesses who were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> and say he told them it never happened and that he would never talk to his parents again for what they made him say. It turned out he'd gone into court and got legal emancipation from his parents." [...] June Chandler testified that she had npt spoken to her son in 11 years. At one point in her testimony, she claimed that she could not remember being sued by Jackson (who had counter-sued for extortion) and at another point said that she had never heard of her own attorney. However, she said she never witnessed any molestation.|$|E
500|$|Consulting {{producer}} Gail Mutrux recommended {{feature film}} director Gary Fleder to direct [...] "Subway" [...] because she believed he would provide visually engaging direction without distracting {{from the story}} in the script. Other Homicide: Life on the Street producers were not familiar with Fleder. When Mutrux told them the name of one of his previous films, Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead, Yoshimura became concerned Fleder was [...] "one of these indie kind of guys [...] <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> and try to reinvent our show", a problem he had experienced with other directors in the past. After watching Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead, however, Yoshimura believed Fleder would be perfect to direct [...] "Subway" [...] because he felt that Fleder could provide strong visuals to a story that took place in one location, and prevent the script from becoming too static and boring. Upon being offered the job, Fleder thought {{that it would be a}} challenge due to most of the action being confined to a single set, but accepted the director position based on the strength of Yoshimura's script:, [...] "The script was terrific. And for me, the big issue from day one was, 'How do I not screw it up?'" [...] Yoshimura said that feature directors often struggle with Homicide: Life on the Street because they are used to working at a slower and more deliberate pace than the typical eight-day filming period of a single episode. Additionally, Yoshimura said, they have little time to adjust to the regular cast and crew, which he described as a [...] "closed community [...] used to shooting or working a certain way on this show, and then have their rhythms and their patterns and their habits".|$|E
2500|$|The {{band members}} are Christians {{and in an}} {{interview}} with the BBC, Josh Farro stated [...] "Our faith is very important to us. It's obviously <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out <b>in</b> our music because if someone believes something, then their world view is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out <b>in</b> anything they do. But we're not out here to preach to kids, we're out here because we love music." ...|$|R

According to Timbaland, [...] "That {{group is the}} most amazing and creative, {{innovative}} group that's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out <b>in</b> 2010." [...] However, the band had already decided to go with Universal Motown.|$|R
2500|$|Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly {{notes in}} her {{assessment}} of the review: [...] "We’ve got one more week until the winter finale of Once Upon a Time, and we’re finally getting some answers {{to what happened in}} Camelot all those weeks ago. Namely: We have memories! Finally! Which is good because those memories are definitely <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> handy with what currently is threatening Storybrooke..." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Basie {{took his}} {{orchestra}} to New York in 1937, {{they made the}} Woodside Hotel in Harlem their base (they often rehearsed in its basement). Soon, they were booked at the Roseland Ballroom for the Christmas show. Basie recalled a review, which said something like, [...] "We caught the great Count Basie band {{which is supposed to}} be so hot he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> here and set the Roseland on fire. [...] Well, the Roseland is still standing". Compared to the reigning band of Fletcher Henderson, Basie's band lacked polish and presentation.|$|E
2500|$|Wolverine makes a brief {{appearance}} in [...] as Weapon X. Having somehow been captured by Stryker at some point, {{he has been}} given an adamantium skeleton and subject to brutal mental conditioning, leaving him operating on a more feral state than a human level. When some of the adult X-Men are captured by Stryker's men, Jean, Scott and Kurt Wagner are able to infiltrate Stryker's base and find Logan's cage, with Jean sensing the human mind underneath the conditioning and releasing him {{so that he can}} help. After Weapon X tears his way through Stryker's forces, the three teens find him at a small side-exit to the base, Jean's telepathy to restore some of Logan's human memories before he runs off into the snow. Writer Simon Kinberg explained that the character was originally intended to have a larger role in the film, saying [...] "There was always a notion that we wanted Wolverine to be in the movie. We wanted {{to find a way to}} feature him in the film, partly because Bryan [...] and I love Hugh [...] so much. We love the character, obviously, and he’s such a huge part of the franchise. There were a lot of iterations of how Wolverine would enter and exit the movie. There was a version when he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> at the midpoint of the film and be like the drill sergeant for the kids and take over as their leader. And we felt like that stepped on Jennifer Lawrence's role in the movie and becoming their leader".|$|E
50|$|Gov. Isaac Stevens: Isaac Stevens was {{appointed}} {{as the first}} governor of the Washington Territory, and Superintendent of Indian Affairs of the Washington Territory. His goal for the Pacific Northwest was to build a transcontinental railroad, which would have forced the Native Americans to leave their home. Obviously this issue was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> loggerheads. <b>In</b> the book, the public view Stevens as power hungry, vicious man—he declared war on the Native Americans.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004 Simon told Regis Philbin, [...] "If I tell it, it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out <b>in</b> dribs and drabs. And I've {{given out}} two letters already, an 'A' and an 'E.' But I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> add one <b>to</b> it. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> add an 'R,' {{in honor of}} you." ...|$|R

"This {{is really}} {{promising}} that the labels are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> finally stop kvetching and start thinking intelligently about where their money's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from <b>in</b> the 21st century," [...] said Aram Sinnreich, of Radar Research, being {{quoted in the}} Los Angeles Times. [...] "SpiralFrog is one small step for the record labels, one great leap for music kind." ...|$|R
2500|$|Colbert's {{candidacy}} had met mixed reviews, and {{the growing}} realization that Colbert may be serious about his candidacy raised the ire of the American political and media establishment. When the Public Opinion Strategies poll put Colbert ahead of Bill Richardson, Richardson's spokesman responded: [...] "This is a serious election with serious consequences {{and we are not}} going to comment on this ridiculous exercise". Katon Dawson, South Carolina's Republican party chairman believed Colbert would be better off using the $35,000 entrance fee to [...] "buy a sports car and get a girlfriend". The high polling gave way to what New York called a [...] "Stephen Colbert Backlash", as bloggers criticized Colbert for verging into legitimate political territory, asserting that he had [...] "crossed the line from lampooning the process to actively messing it up." [...] Republican candidate John McCain gave a more positive view, stating that he hoped Colbert would join the Republican party's debates. [...] "He can make them livelier and he can reach a wider audience than that narrow little sliver that watches his show." [...] In conversation with ABC News, Fox News commentator and template for Stephen Colbert's The Colbert Report persona Bill O'Reilly dismissed Colbert's run as a publicity stunt for his book, I Am America. O'Reilly also called Colbert out for not going on the O'Reilly Factor to discuss the book: [...] "He knows the book is dumb, so he's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in.</b> Instead, he runs for president." [...] Sam Brownback's October 19, 2007 withdrawal from the race was humorously attributed by some to competition from the comedian, but others took Colbert's challenge to Brownback's run more seriously. As one reporter for The Atlantic wrote, [...] "Sam Brownback may cite other reasons for dropping out today, but Colbert’s plan to run in South Carolina wouldn’t have made his job there any easier." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jordan Chandler, who was 25 at {{the time}} of the trial, chose to leave the country rather than testify, and the only person in his family who {{appeared}} for questioning was his mother, June. She denied having seen any molestation, but talked about Jordan and Michael sleeping in the same room on numerous occasions, explaining that she initially didn't want them to, but was persuaded by Jackson, who had cried and been hurt that she didn't trust him. She testified about Jackson buying all kinds of gifts for the family, the trips they'd been on together, and how fun it was to be part of Jackson's world. She said she'd been concerned that her son was starting to dress like Jackson and wanting to spend all his time with him. When asked about the lawsuits that resulted from her family's involvement with Michael Jackson, June Chandler made the distinction that even though she was listed as a plaintiff and received settlement money, it was not she who sued Jackson, but rather Jordan and his father Evan who did so. [...] She claimed not to recall that Jackson had counter sued for extortion, or that her second husband, Dave Schwartz, had sued Jackson, or that Evan Chandler had sued Jackson a second time. Thomas Mesereau said in a Harvard lecture later that year, [...] "the prosecutors tried to get [...] to show up, and he wouldn't. If he had, I had witnesses who were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> and say he told them it never happened and that he would never talk to his parents again for what they made him say. It turned out he'd gone into court and got legal emancipation from his parents." [...] June Chandler testified that she had not spoken to her son Jordan in 11 years, since 1994.|$|E

60|$|Sally {{listened to}} this saga breathlessly. More than ever did she feel {{responsible}} for her young protégé, and any faint qualms which she had entertained as to the wisdom of transferring {{practically the whole of}} her patrimony to the care of so erratic a financier as her brother vanished. It was her plain duty to see that Ginger was started well in the race of life, and Fillmore was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> uncommonly handy.|$|E
2500|$|He quickly grew {{disillusioned with}} the {{political}} system. [...] "Energy systems are notorious for their long gestation periods, often twenty years or longer, [...] {{there had to be}} a pay-off in a product within five to seven years in order to justify the public money being put in. There are political cycles involving re-election, so the politicians didn't want to put money into systems that were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> fruition <b>in</b> some other generation. You sent out the plans, and they hacked and cut at them." [...] When the contract ran out, he decided to quit and strike out on his own.|$|R
2500|$|After a long {{recording}} hiatus, Ford {{released the}} new album Wicked Wonderland on 6 October 2009, on the JLRG Entertainment label.

50|$|The {{war against}} France in 1512-14 {{was the most}} {{significant}} opportunity for Wolsey to demonstrate his talents in the foreign policy arena.

England formed an alliance with the Pope, Ferdinand V of Spain, and Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor against Louis XII of France.|$|R
60|$|Oh, I was a hero--with {{my line of}} retreat {{straight}} behind me.

They had us cornered in the car, and they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> and man-handle us. They started. I didn't kick anybody in the face. I jerked the opposite door open, and the gay-cat and I went out. The train-crew took after us.|$|E
6000|$|He knocked {{his pipe}} {{out on the}} edge of his still uptilted chair, as he talked.

So I waited till the Creator of heaven and earth could get a minute off and help me out. But He seemed pretty busy with the solar system this morning, and I had about given up when He sent that Gillespie girl in sight. I knew that would fetch Sally; but it was an {{inspiration}} of my own to suggest Abel's chance to him; I don't want to put that on your Maker, Martha." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the present}} and also in later {{sittings}} Joan was urged to name the exact day of her deliverance; {{but she could not}} do that. She had not the permission of her Voices. Moreover, the Voices themselves did not name the precise day. Ever since the fulfilment of the prophecy, I have believed that Joan had the idea that her deliverance was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> the form of death. But not that death! Divine as she was, dauntless as she was in battle, she was human also. She was not solely a saint, an angel, she was a clay-made girl also--as human a girl as any in the world, and full of a human girl's sensitiveness and tenderness and delicacies. And so, that death! No, she could not have lived the three months with that one before her, I think. You remember that the first time she was wounded she was frightened, and cried, just as any other girl of seventeen would have done, although she had known for eighteen days {{that she was going to}} be wounded on that very day. No, she was not afraid of any ordinary death, and an ordinary death was what she believed the prophecy of deliverance meant, I think, for her face showed happiness, not horror, when she uttered it.|$|E
