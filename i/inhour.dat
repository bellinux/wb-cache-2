In this method, {{the assumption is}} made that reactivity worth of a fuel element is a known function of burnup, often a linear relationship. When a fuel element burns, reactivity is reduced due to depletion of fissile actinides and generation of neutron-absorbing fission products. Currently, {{there is a lack}} of experimental data to verify the current composition of the KSU TRIGA (Training Research Isotopes General Atomics) fuel. Moreover, the KSU TRIGA Mark II staff method of estimating burnup is admittedly inaccurate due to its simple approximations. This work presents the positive period technique as convenient method use only the excess reactivity of the KSU core to compute reactivity via the <b>inhour</b> equation. Period measurements are determined via extraction and manipulation of the time dependent power data in the measurements. MCNP and Serpent modeling codes are both used extract the neutron kinetics parameters necessary in the <b>inhour</b> equation. Seven axial discretization of the KSU fuel was modeled, which minimizes the reactivity biases as function of burnup. Moreover, two unit cell models of the KSU TRIGA fuel were investigated. Modeled reactivity worths were computed using the KCODE in MCNP for comparative analysis. The burnup steps using two power peaking factor methods were developed to account for the biases introduced initial burnup of fuel prior to installation at KSU. By using the error distribution given by the two method to generate 200 test cases of the burnup steps can yield to reactivity worths as a function of burnup with quantifiable uncertainties. Finally, the results suggest that validation from another nondestructive technique such as gamma spectroscopy is necessary to asses the reactivity biases observed for higher burnup fuel elements due to unknown radial orientations. This work ultimately supports the production of a high-fidelity model of the KSU reactor...|$|E
40|$|The central {{reactivity}} void worth {{was measured}} in the Oak Ridge unmoderated and unreflected uranium (93. 20 wt% {sup 235 }U) metal sphere by replacement measurements in a small (0. 460 -cm-diam) central spherical region in an 8. 7427 -cm-radius sphere. The central void worth was 9. 165 {+-} 0. 023 cents using the delayed neutron relative abundances and decay constants of Keepin, Wimett, and Zeigler to obtain the reactivity in cents from the stable reactor period measurements using the <b>Inhour</b> equation. This value is slightly larger than measurements with GODIVA 1 with larger cylindrical samples of uranium (93. 70 wt% {sup 235 }U) in the center: 135. 50 {+-} 0. 12 cents/mole for GODIVA 1 and 138. 05 {+-} 0. 34 cents/mole for the Oak Ridge sphere measurements, and the difference {{could be due to}} sample size effect. The central worth in {Delta}k units was calculated by neutron transport theory methods to be 6. 02 {+-} 0. 01 x 10 {sup {minus} 4 } {Delta}k. The measured and calculated values are related by the effective delayed neutron fraction. The value of the effective delayed neutron fraction obtained in this way from the Oak Ridge sphere is 0. 00657 {+-} 0. 00002, which is in excellent agreement with that obtained from GODIVA 1 measurements, where the effective delayed neutron fraction was determined as the increment between delayed and prompt criticality and was 0. 0066. From these Oak Ridge measurements, using the delayed neutron parameters of ENDF-B/VI to obtain the reactivity from the stable reactor period measurements, the central void worth is 7. 984 {+-} 0. 021 cents, and the inferred effective delayed neutron fraction is 0. 00754. This central void worth and effective delayed neutron fractions are 14. 2 % higher than those obtained from use of the Keepin et al. delayed neutron data and produce a value of delayed neutron fraction in disagreement with GODIVA 1 measurements, thus questioning the usefulness of the relative abundances and decay constants of the six-group delayed neutron parameters of ENDF-B/VI for uranium for obtaining the reactivity from the measured reactor period using the <b>Inhour</b> equation...|$|E

Energy, 24, No. 3, 205, (1997)), {{the authors}} {{presented}} a two-region point kinetic model for reflected reactors {{based on the}} Avery-Cohn differential equations. The model was developed for a core region surrounded by a non-multiplying, source-free reflector region. As part of the model development, they also introduced several probability relationships that were essential to calculating the coupling parameters that linked the two regions. Furthermore, they showed how these coupling parameters could be obtained from deterministic transport solutions. In this work, they present a new model that extends the aforementioned two-region kinetic model by including neutron multiplication in both regions. This new model has practical application to any reactor system that has significantly different neutronic properties in two distinct regions of the system [...] such as a fast breeder reactor consisting of an inner core surrounded by a multiplying blanket of a different composition.

40|$|A {{technique}} {{based on}} the Padé approximations {{is applied to the}} solution of the point kinetics equations. The method consists of treating explicitly the roots of the <b>inhour</b> formula which would make the Padé approximations inaccurate. Also, an analytic method is developed which permits a fast inversion of polynomials of the point kinetics matrix and has direct applicability to the Pads approximations. Results are presented for several cases using various options of the method. It is concluded that the technique provides a fast and accurate computational method for the point kinetics equations. Also, an implicit solution method for the time-dependent multigroup diffusion equations known as the "theta method" is studied. Both the usual method and a variation of it, derived from the precursor integrated equations, are considered. Several properties of both versions of the theta method are demonstrated. An attempt is made to find better integration parameters (thetas) for the method, based on corresponding point kinetics calculations. Calculations are done for several test cases, leading {{to the conclusion that the}} improvements obtained are of limited value. "December 1971.

40|$|We have {{obtained}} results {{for a large}} sodium-cooled fast breeder reactor benchmark {{using data from the}} ENDF/B-VI and from Revision 1 of the JEF- 1 (JEF- 1. 1) evaluation. The required cross sections were processed with the NJOY code system (Version 89. 62) and homogenized with the spectrum cell code MICROX- 2. Multigroup transport-theory calculations in 33 neutron groups (forward and adjoint) were performed using the two-dimensional code TWODANT and kinetic parameters were determined using the first-order perturbation-theory code PERT-V. We calculated eigenvalues, neutron balance data, global and regional breeding and conversion ratios, central reaction rate ratios and reactivity worths with and without sodium, effective delayed neutron fraction and <b>inhour</b> reactivity, regional sodium void reactivity, and isothermal core fuel Doppler-reactivities. In particular, it is shown that good agreement (generally within one standard deviation) is achieved between these results and the average values over sixteen benchmark solutions obtained in the past. The eigenvalues predicted with ENDF/B-VI are up to 0. 7 % larger than those calculated with JEF- 1. 1 cross sections. This discrepancy is mainly due to different inelastic scattering cross sections for 23 Na and 238 U, and to different fast fission and nubar data for 23 gPu. Zusammenfassun...|$|E
40|$|The {{prompt neutron}} {{lifetime}} of the SRE {{was measured by}} both the oscillation and random noise techniques. Measurement by use of the oscillation technique gave a prompt neutron lifetime of (5 25 plus or minus 0 35) x 10 /sup - 4 / sec for a calculated beta of 7 x 10 /sup - 3 /. The measured noise response indicated a lifetime of (5. 25 plus or minus 0. 7) x 10 /sup - 4 / sec. Both measured values are {{in agreement with the}} calculated value of 5 x 10 /sup - 4 / sec. Four experiments utilizing the noise analysis technique were performed to determine the prompt neutron lifetime of the KEWB. All four experiments gave results which agreed within 3 %, For an estimated beta of 8 x 10 /sup - 3 /, the measured value obtained was (7. 8 plus or minus 0. 3) x 10 /sup - 5 / sec. This is in reasonable agreement with both the energy independert calculated value of 6. 6 x 10 /sup - 5 / see and the value of 6. 2 x 10 /sup - 5 / sec obtained from the experimental <b>inhour</b> equation The oscillation technique {{has been found to be}} better suited for lifetime determinations in reactors where the prompt neutron break frequency is less than 5 cps.

40|$|In {{the present}} work {{the problem of}} the on-line {{monitoring}} of the reactivity in a sourcefree nuclear reactor is considered. The method is based on the classic point kinetic model of reactor physics. A relationship between the instantaneous value of the system stable period and the values of the neutron flux amplitude (or the power), of its derivative and of the integral convolution term determining the instantaneous value of the effective delayed neutron concentration is derived. The reactivity can then be evaluated through the the application of the <b>inhour</b> equation, assuming the effective delayed neutron fraction and prompt generation time are known from independent measurements. Since the power related quantities can be assumed to be experimental observables at each instant, the reactivity can be easily reconstructed. The method is tested at first through the interpretation of power histories simulated by the solution of the point kinetic equations; the effect of the time interval between power detections on the accuracy is studied, proving the excellent performance of the procedure. The work includes also a study on the sensitivity of the reactivity forecast to the uncertainty on the values of the effective delayed neutron fraction and prompt generation time. The spatial effects are investigated by applying the method to the interpretation of flux evolution histories generated by a numerical code solving the space-time dependent neutron kinetic equations in the diffusion model. Also in this case the method proves to be quite effective in providing good estimates of the system reactivity, except at very short times after the introduction of a perturbation inducing a spatial transient. At last, the effect of the experimental noise is investigated, proving that the consequences in the accuracy of the reactivity prediction can be mitigated by using an adequate differentiation algorith...|$|E
