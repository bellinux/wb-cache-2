25|$|Following λ-red operon {{activity}} induction, a linear, double-stranded cassette encoding a selectable marker, such as antibiotic resistance, {{is transformed}} into the cells {{in place of the}} target gene and incorporated into the DNA behind a specific <b>inducible</b> <b>promoter.</b> This allows for growth selection of the recombinant cells with proper insertion location verified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Specific incorporation can be achieved by including flanking PCR primers around the inserted linear DNA that are complement to the targeted insertion site. After selection of the recombinants, a second transformation is needed to remove the selective marker. A plasmid expressing flippase (FLP) can be transformed into the recombined cells, which can specifically cleave FLP recognition target sites (FRTs) flanking the antibiotic resistance gene. While this successfully removes the selective marker from the genome, it leaves FRT scars in place of the target gene.|$|E

Using this technology, the loss or alteration of a gene can be studied in a given target organ of interest, even in cases where experimental animals would not survive the loss of this gene in other organs("spatial control"). The effect of altering a gene can also be studied over time, by using an <b>inducible</b> <b>promoter</b> to trigger the recombination activity late in development ("temporal control") - this prevents the alteration.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} label small populations of cells {{from a common}} progenitor, MARCM uses the GAL4-UAS system. A marker gene such as GFP is placed under control of a UAS promoter. GAL4 is ubiquitously {{expressed}} in these flies, thus driving marker expression. In addition, GAL80 is driven by a strong promoter such as tubP. Gal80 is an inhibitor of GAL4, and will suppress GFP expression under normal conditions. This tubP-GAL80 element is placed distal to an FRT site. A second FRT site is placed in trans to the GAL80 site, usually with a gene or mutation of interest distal to it. Finally, FLP recombinase is driven by an <b>inducible</b> <b>promoter</b> such as heat shock.|$|E

P1 vectors also contain a P1 plasmid replicon, which ensures only one copy of the vector is present in a cell.

30|$|We {{only found}} three {{examples}} where <b>inducible</b> <b>promoters</b> were used. In {{the case of}} the avirulence gene avrXa 27, this was necessary to avoid massive HR cell death triggered by the recognition of the product of the avirulence gene and the corresponding major resistance gene Xa 27 (Tian and Yin 2009).

Moreover, the permanent activation of some disease signaling pathways caused by the use of a constitutive promoter has a metabolic cost that could be measured in terms of carbohydrate storage losses (see below). In one case of pyramiding, several promoters were used, limiting potential silencing issues (Kim et al. 2003). It is likely that <b>inducible</b> <b>promoters</b> will be required in the future to limit side effects (see below) and yield penalty.

Type I promoters consists of a consensus -35 and -10 region (Pribnow Box) upstream of the gene start site. Heidorn et al. 2011 {{compiled a list of}} native Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 promoters that have been used in synthetic constructs, although this leads to cross talk and non-orthogonal or non-specific gene expression. A handful of Anderson promoters (a group of constitutive promoters collected from a combinatorial library based on the consensus -35 (5’-TTGACA-3’) and -10 (5’-TATAAT-3’) regions), represented best by BBa_J23101, have been demonstrated to function in Synechocystis sp.

Several popular <b>inducible</b> <b>promoters</b> in E. coli are the pBad, pTet, and pLac promoters, all of which repress gene expression by a repressor molecule that binds the gene operator and blocks RNAP progression.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Real-time {{systems that}} provide {{evidence}} of pathogen contamination in crops {{can be an important}} new line of early defense in agricultural centers. Plants possess defense mechanisms to protect against pathogen attack. Inducible plant defense is controlled by signal transduction pathways, <b>inducible</b> <b>promoters</b> and cis-regulatory elements corresponding to key genes involved in defense, and pathogen-specific responses. Identified <b>inducible</b> <b>promoters</b> and cis-acting elements could be utilized in plant sentinels, or ‘phytosensors’, by fusing these to reporter genes to produce plants with altered phenotypes in response to the presence of pathogens. Here, we have employed cis-acting elements from promoter regions of pathogen inducible genes as well as those responsive to the plant defense signal molecules salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene. Synthetic promoters were constructed by combining various regulatory elements supplemented with the enhancer elements from the Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35 S promoter to increase basal level of the GUS expression. The inducibility of each synthetic promoter was first assessed in transient expression assays using Arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts and then examined for efficacy in stably transgenic Arabidopsis and tobacco plants...|$|R
50|$|Pichia pastoris has two {{alcohol oxidase}} genes, Aox1 and Aox2, {{which have a}} {{strongly}} <b>inducible</b> <b>promoter.</b> These genes allow Pichia to use methanol as a carbon and energy source. The AOX promoters are induced by methanol and are repressed by e.g. glucose. Usually the gene for the desired protein is introduced {{under the control of}} the AOX1 promoter, which means that protein production can be induced by the addition of methanol. In a popular expression vector, the desired protein is produced as a fusion product to the secretion signal of the α-mating factor from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast). This causes the protein to be secreted into the growth medium, which greatly facilitates subsequent protein purification. There are commercially available plasmids that have these features incorporated (such as the pPICZα vector).|$|E

Here, the duration of cell cycle arrest depends not only on the final level of input Fus3, but also on the previously achieved Fus3 levels. This effect is achieved in due to the slower time scales involved in the transcription of intermediate Far1, such that the total Far1 activity reaches its equilibrium value slowly, and for transient changes in Fus3 concentration, the response of the system depends on the Far1 concentration achieved with the transient value. Experiments in this type of hysteresis benefit from the ability to change the concentration of the inputs with time. The mechanisms are often elucidated by allowing independent control of the concentration of the key intermediate, for instance, by using an <b>inducible</b> <b>promoter.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{photochemical}} internalisation (PCI) technology liberates endocytosed macromolecules like transgenes from endocytic vesicles {{in response}} to photochemical treatment. Thereby PCI improves gene transfection and is suggested for use in gene therapy. It has been proposed that PCI might also stimulate transcription of internalised transgenes, {{especially if they are}} controlled by photochemically <b>inducible</b> <b>promoters</b> (transcriptional targeting). In order to identify <b>inducible</b> <b>promoters,</b> and to evaluate the treatments influence on cellular transcriptional activity, the effect of the photochemical treatment as used in PCI (with the photosensitizer disulfonated meso-tetraphenylporphin followed by illumination) on gene transcription in WiDr adenocarcinoma cells was evaluated using microarrays. The expression of 390 genes were identified significantly changed (89 % were up-regulated), of which genes associated with DNA binding and transcriptional functions were the most represented. This may be important for the expression of a photochemically internalised transgene under a specific promoter control. Real-time PCR verified photochemical up-regulation of the HSP family genes, as well as down-regulation of EGR- 1 at 2 – 10 h post-treatment, suggesting that the HSP (particularly HSP 70), in addition to the microarray-identified metallothioneins, but not the EGR- 1 promoters, could be relevant promoter candidates for transcriptional targeting via PCI. The resulting overview of gene expression changes in WiDr cells exposed to the PCI-relevant photochemical treatment also provide a basis for the design of new PCI-based strategies with respect of transcriptional targeting...|$|R
