The estimation method relies on the extraction of the glottal flow derivative from voice after removing the vocal tract transfer function by inverse filtering. This spectral density is related to the vocal fold cover biomechanics, and {{it is well known that}} certain speaker’s features as gender, age or pathologic condition are present in it. For such a database of 100 pathology-free speakers equally balanced in gender and age is used as an experimental framework to draft the results exposed in the work. As the estimated biometric parameters show a certain degree of crosscorrelation Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce parameter dimension. The principal components are used in unsupervised k-means clustering of speakers (unsupervised gender detection). The outcome grouping shows an almost complete separation of speakers by gender in terms of the most relevant parameters derived from a statistical dispersion study. Possible applications of the study can be found in <b>forensic</b> <b>acoustics</b> as well as in speaker identification and verification tasks...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Understanding {{the noise}} {{characteristics}} for finding appropriate filtering technique/s {{so as to}} obtain sufficiently clear speech samples for Speaker Identification, {{is one of the}} challenging tasks in <b>Forensic</b> <b>Acoustics.</b> Speaker’s idiosyncratic speech should not be affected when the noise reduction is carried out; otherwise, Speaker Identification becomes highly erroneous. We have collected fifty noisy speech samples reported to be recorded in different modes from actual crime cases received in the laboratory. The samples are analyzed after subjecting to various filtering techniques and compared with the clear speech mixed with the noise collected from non-speech portion. Distortion levels on the speech are studied at various stages of application of filters in terms of SNR and Speaker Specific Information. Retaining the Speaker Specific Information as primary concern of our study, the limitation of filtering techniques depending on the characteristic and intensity level of noise is worked out for noisy speech samples. Subsequently a statistical study is also conducted. Listening tests were conducted to ensure that the perceptual features of the original noisy speech are preserved while applying filters. This work demonstrates the efficiency of Noise reduction filters in improving SNR and their controlled applications for preserving Speaker dependent features depending on the various noise characteristics embedded on speech samples...|$|E

30|$|The {{similarity}} {{of the estimated}} acoustic reverberation parameters, τ and σ, from selected segments of a given audio recording {{can be used for}} both <b>forensic</b> analysis and <b>acoustic</b> environment identification (AEI). For example, a small (resp. large) distance in the estimated reverberation parameters from a test recording indicates relatively consistent (resp. inconsistent) acoustic environment. In addition, similarity in the estimated reverberation parameters from two different recordings indicates that these recordings were made in acoustically identical environments and vice versa.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims at {{testing a}} new {{parameter}} of acoustic analysis of speech {{to be used}} in forensic phonetic analysis. We state the following hypothesis: Prevoicing values depend on speaker physiological and motion abilities and are part of his profile. We describe the results of the acoustic analysis of speech of fourteen European Portuguese speakers and we compare them to a real forensic case. Our results show that Prevoicing is clearly a cue for speaker identity and, consequently, it must be included in <b>acoustic</b> <b>forensic</b> evaluation reports. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of long-time formant distribution is relatively young but promising discipline of speaker identification. It {{is a method}} of mapping the long-term behavior of formants in speech of individual speakers. Frequently encountered problems in practice are bad acoustic quality and very short duration of analyzed recordings. This work aims to present {{the historical development of}} forensic phonetics and currently used methods. In the practical part, it deals with the usability of LTF method in forensic practice, especially in recordings containing background noise. It was shown that the noise appreciably affects extracted LTF values and unfortunately the change is not systematic. Therefore, we proposed several methods to compensate the noise in recordings, {{in order to be able}} to compare recordings with and without noise. We also investigated the minimum duration of recording, which is necessary for statistical reliability of the resulting values. This boundary is not exact and for each speaker, it is substantially individual. But it is apparent that recordings (vocalic streams) shorter than 15 s often provide incomplete information, wherefore they cannot be recommended for analysis.

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{of speech and}} sound plays an ever increasing role within criminal investigations. Forensic speech scientists are often asked to make assessments of the psychological states of victims in recorded attacks. However, such evaluations are currently not advocated by the International Association for <b>Forensic</b> Phonetics and <b>Acoustics</b> (IAFPA), presumably due to insufficient research on which to form an opinion (IAFPA, 2007). Previous studies investigating emotional speech have concerned speech technology applications (Erickson, 2003) and/or observed vocal cues of emotion in everyday speech (Scherer, 2003). Few attempt to characterise extreme emotion and fewer use authentic data. This study addresses possible vocal cues of distress, defined as the extreme emotional and physical states of fear and pain. Acoustic and auditory analyses were conducted on four authentic forensic audio recordings involving violent attacks. Parameters under investigation were chosen following observations from studies using recordings of psychologically stressed aviation personnel (William and Stevens, 1969; Kuroda et al., 1976), and included fundamental frequency (F 0), tempo, intensity and intelligibility of vowels...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} and perception of emotional speech is of growing importance to forensic speech scientists. They are often asked by instructing parties {{to provide an}} opinion as to whether recordings representing a violent attack are genuine, and whether speech material reflects real distress. However, they are prohibited from making statements regarding the psychological states of speakers by the International Association of <b>Forensic</b> Phonetics and <b>Acoustics</b> Code of Practice (IAFPA 2004). This study investigates two principal questions. First, it investigates how distress speech can be manifested acoustically. In so doing it proposes a taxonomy for comparing distress speech across speakers, assists in delimiting {{the boundaries of the}} vocal repertoire, and considers the extent to which acoustic measures of distress speech can distinguish between the vocalisations of real victims and actors. Second, it investigates whether listeners can discriminate between genuine and acted distress portrayals, and to what extent familiarity with forensic material increases listeners’ ability. Recordings from authentic criminal cases involving violent attack are compared with re-enactments by trained actors. Acoustic analyses examine F 0, intensity, vowel formant frequencies and articulation rate. The recordings are also used as stimuli in a perceptual listening test, comparing the performance of lay listeners, police call takers and forensic practitioners. The findings lend support to the view that assessments of distress should be exercised with extreme caution. On the one hand, acoustic parameters can distinguish between non-distress and distress conditions, but cannot discriminate between acted and authentic distress, and so IAFPA’s refrain from such an assessment is justified. On the other, listeners who are familiar with authentic distress data, such as police call takers and forensic practitioners, are better able to differentiate between acted and authentic distress than lay listeners. Thus, if an assessment were to be made, the forensic practitioners may be the best group to do so. ...|$|R
