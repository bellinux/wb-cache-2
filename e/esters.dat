5|$|All {{corticosteroid}} hormones share cholesterol as {{a common}} precursor. Therefore, {{the first step in}} steroidogenesis is cholesterol uptake or synthesis. Cells that produce steroid hormones can acquire cholesterol through two paths. The main source is through dietary cholesterol transported via the blood as cholesterol <b>esters</b> within low density lipoproteins (LDL). LDL enters the cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. The other source of cholesterol is synthesis in the cell's endoplasmic reticulum. Synthesis can compensate when LDL levels are abnormally low. In the lysosome, cholesterol <b>esters</b> are converted to free cholesterol, which is then used for steroidogenesis or stored in the cell.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Carboxylesterase {{overproduction}} is a frequently observed resistance {{mechanism of}} insects to organophosphate insecticides. As a major transmitter of human diseases, mosquitoes in the Culex pipiens complex have evolved 13 carboxylesterase alleles (<b>Ester)</b> that confer organophosphate resistance. Six alleles, <b>Ester</b> B 1, <b>Ester</b> 2, <b>Ester</b> 8, <b>Ester</b> 9, <b>Ester</b> B 10, and <b>Ester</b> 11, {{have been observed}} in field populations in China, sometimes co-existing in one population. To differentiate the carboxylesterase alleles found in these field populations, PCR-RFLP was designed for use in resistance monitoring. Results Based on the DNA sequences of resistant and nonresistant carboxylesterase alleles, <b>Ester</b> B alleles were first amplified with PCR-specific primers and then digested with the restriction enzyme Dra I. In this step, <b>Ester</b> 2 and <b>Ester</b> 11 were differentiated from the other <b>Ester</b> alleles.

40|$|Abstract Background In China, {{large amounts}} of {{chemical}} insecticides are applied in fields or indoors every year, directly or indirectly bringing selection pressure on vector mosquitoes. Culex pipiens complex has evolved to be resistant to all types of chemical insecticides, especially organophosphates, through carboxylesterases. Six resistant carboxylesterase alleles (<b>Ester)</b> were recorded previously and sometimes co-existed in one field population, representing a complex situation {{for the evolution of}} <b>Ester</b> genes. Results In order to explore the evolutionary scenario, we analyzed the data from an historical record in 2003 and a recent investigation on five Culex pipiens pallens populations sampled from north China in 2010. Insecticide bioassays showed that these five populations had high resistance to pyrethroids, medium resistance to organophosphates, and low resistance to carbamates. Six types of <b>Ester</b> alleles, <b>Ester</b> B 1, <b>Ester</b> 2, <b>Ester</b> 8, <b>Ester</b> 9, <b>Ester</b> B 10, and <b>Ester</b> 11 were identified, and the overall pattern of their frequencies in geographic distribution was consistent with the report seven years prior to this study. Statistical correlation analysis indicated that <b>Ester</b> 8 and <b>Ester</b> 9 positively correlated with resistance to four insecticides, and <b>Ester</b> B 10 to one insecticide. The occurrences of these three alleles were positively correlated, while the occurrence of <b>Ester</b> B 1 was negatively correlated with <b>Ester</b> 8, indicating an allelic competition. Conclusion Our analysis suggests that one insecticide can select multiple <b>Ester</b> alleles and one <b>Ester</b> allele can work on multiple insecticides. The evolutionary scenario of carboxylesterases under insecticide selection is possibly "one to many". </p...|$|R

People in South East Asia with frequent exposures to durian are able to easily distinguish its sweet-like ketones and <b>esters</b> scent from rotten or putrescine odours which are from volatile amines and fatty acids. Developmental or genetic differences in olfactory perception and mapping within the brain (for e.g. anterior piriform cortex to the orbitofrontal cortex) could possibly explain why some individuals are unable to differentiate these smells and find this fruit noxious whereas others find it extremely pleasant and appealing.|$|E
