5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} {{that if they}} can find the Isolus pod and provide it power, the alien will leave Chloe. A frantic Chloe draws the TARDIS and the Doctor, trapping them both {{in one of her}} sketches and forcing Rose to try to find the pod herself. She rationalises that the pod is located on the hottest spot on the street, a patch of freshly laid tar, and is able to dig it up. Meanwhile, Chloe has caused the entire crowd at the Olympic stadium to disappear and now is set on making everyone in the world disappear. Rose tries {{to find out how to}} power the pod, and uses visual indications from the Doctor's picture to understand that the pod needs heat mixed with emotion. Rose throws the pod towards the Olympic Torch - a symbol of hope, courage, and love - as it passes down the street. The missing children and the crowd at the Olympics reappear, and Rose realises that the drawing Chloe had made of her father will similarly come to life. Rose and Chloe's mother are able to calm Chloe by singing the Kookaburra song, causing the unseen monster - having <b>fed</b> <b>off</b> of Chloe's emotions and fears - to disappear.|$|E
5|$|Although Sunnydale {{has long}} been {{familiar}} with demons and monsters who have inhabited the town and <b>fed</b> <b>off</b> its residents, in this episode the conventions by which societal functions are so disrupted by the unexplained silence that significant chaos results, enough to warrant both Riley and Buffy going on patrol to keep order. Buffy and Willow walk down a familiar street, arm-in-arm and easily startled, and see a bank closed and patrons running into a liquor store that is obviously open. The breakdown of order also causes sudden religious fervor; {{a group of people}} have gathered on the street to read the Bible (Revelation 15:1 is written on a signboard—an allusion to the seven angels with seven plagues as there are seven Gentlemen, according to author Nikki Stafford). Opportunistic capitalist fervor results in a man selling overpriced dry erase boards. Community, notes Patrick Shade (citing sociologist George Herbert Mead), consists of institutions such as language, religion, and economics. When one institution disappears, Sunnydale residents begin to depend more heavily on the others. Mostly, however, individuals are isolated from one another during the silence. Even the Scoobies find their bonds shaken, as they are unable to use the witty banter that has marked them as a group thus far. (This awkwardness extended even to the actors: the first silent scene the entire cast attempted was the Scoobies gathering in Giles' apartment following the discovery that all of Sunnydale's denizens had lost their voices. It took several rehearsals as the scene came out mistimed, with all of the actors having trouble playing off one another without the use of verbal cues, or all pantomiming over one another.) Without a common language to fall back upon the Scoobies are forced to depend on their shared history to help them recover well {{enough to be able to}} take action.|$|E

25|$|The {{severity}} of the Blizzard of 2003 {{can be attributed to}} the unusually favorable atmospheric conditions surrounding the storm (synoptic conditions). Most notably, the storm allowed for cyclogenesis off of the coastal Carolinas, a feature that is common to most major winter storms in the eastern parts of North America. This secondary system <b>fed</b> <b>off</b> the moisture of the Atlantic Ocean and enhanced precipitation totals from North Carolina to Massachusetts. Secondly, a high pressure system was in place over eastern portions of Canada, allowing for cold air to be brought down into the coastal areas in a process known as cold air advection. This cold air ensured that many areas where storms typically produce mixed precipitation received most or all precipitation in the form of snow.|$|E

25|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of newspapers in Cornwall can be {{directly related to the}} boom in tin and copper mining throughout the county. Indeed, both the printed media and the mining industry <b>fed</b> <b>off</b> each other. However, growth was not all due to mining. Agriculture benefited too. By promoting livestock markets outside of a farmer's immediate area, it stimulated expansion of the rural economy. Looking at archive newspapers in Cornwall from the 1830s and 1840s, they are full of detail about markets, property, livestock farming equipment, mining equipment and prices for buying and selling tin and copper as well as other metals. Job vacancies were widely advertised, meaning that workers did not have to toil in their immediate village or town, This became especially important when the mining slump started in the 1880s. Jobs and opportunities were advertised from far-flung places like South Africa, Australia, Bolivia and Canada, where Cornish entrepreneurs had already started new mining operations using skills they had learnt back home.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of zinc oxides on reproductive structure and function in young laying birds (23 weeks of age) and old laying birds (65 weeks of age). Zinc is an important micronutrient in animal metabolism and in poultry. It is used as a dietary supplement to manipulate the reproductive system of the bird. For this purpose two experiments were conducted, Experiment-I and Experiment-II. In Experiment-I, birds were divided in four groups. Treatment to these birds was given for 12 days. At 25 weeks of age five birds from each group were slaughtered. In the remaining five birds of each group treatment was withdrawn and they were kept on normal feed for a period of 15 days. The birds slaughtered after 12 days of treatment were designated as Batch-I and those slaughtered on 15 th day after the withdrawal of treatment were designated as Batch-II. In Batch-I before the start of treatment their initial body weight was recorded and after treatment body weight was recorded after every two days. Linear regression analysis of variance showed that zinc administration and <b>off</b> <b>fed</b> conditions caused significant decrease in body weight over the period of twelve days in all treatment groups. Mean comb length decreased significantly in Group-II (<b>off</b> <b>fed),</b> Group-III (25, 000 ppm Zn/Kg feed) and Group-IV (30, 000 ppm Zn/kg feed) compared to Group-I while comb width decreased only in Group-III. In Group-II (<b>off</b> <b>fed)</b> wattle length and width significantly reduced compared to that of Group-I. Mean ovarian weight and length reduced significantly in Group-II (<b>off</b> <b>fed),</b> Group-III (25, 000 ppm Zn/kg feed) and Group-IV (30, 000 ppm Zn/kg feed) compared to Group-I. Reduction in ovarian weight in Group-II was higher compared to zinc treated groups. Mean oviductal weight and length also decreased significantly in all treatment groups compared to Group-I. Oviductal length in Group-IV showed higher reduction compared to other two treatment groups (II & III). The liver weight of birds in Group-II (<b>off</b> <b>fed)</b> and Group-IV (30, 000 ppm Zn/kg feed) showed significant decrease, however, reduction in Group-II was greater compared to zinc treated groups. There was significantly higher zinc deposition in the ovary, liver and kidney of Group-III (25, 000 ppm zinc/Kg feed) and Group-IV (30, 000 ppm zinc/kg feed) but Group-II (<b>off</b> <b>fed)</b> showed no significant change compared to that of Group-I (control). The deposition of zinc in Group-IV was higher compared to Group-III. Significant reduction in mean plasma concentration of estradiol and progesterone in Group-II, Group-III and Group-IV was observed on 3 rd, 6 th, 9 th and 12 th day of experiment compared to the levels in Group-I (control). Linear regression analysis of variance showed highly significant decrease in plasma estradiol and progesterone concentration in Group-II (<b>off</b> <b>fed),</b> Zn treated Group-III (25, 000 ppm/Kg feed) and Group-IV (30, 000 ppm/Kg feed) over the period of 12 days. Mean plasma level of corticosterone started increasing significantly in Group-II, Group-III and Group-IV from 3 rd day of treatment and remained elevated on 6 th, 9 th and 12 th day of experiment compared to the level in Group-I (control). Linear regression analysis of variance showed highly significant increase in plasma corticosterone concentration in all treatment groups with the advance in the days of treatment. In Batch-I mean number and diameter of yolky follicles reduced highly significantly in Group-II (<b>off</b> <b>fed),</b> Group-III (25, 000 ppm zinc/kg feed) and Group-IV (30, 000 ppm zinc/kg feed) compared to the control. Due to the effect of these treatments large yolky follicles did not develop in treatment groups. Histomorphological measurements of ovarian follicular diameter showed highly significant reduction in all treatment groups, it was <b>off</b> <b>fed</b> group and high zinc treatment which had severe effect on reduction of follicular diameter in all categories above ≤ 200 μm. Similarly, mean ovarian oocyte diameter significantly reduced due to feed withdrawal and two dosages of zinc. Compared to zinc treatments, feed withdrawal had more severe effect in reducing the ovarian oocyte diameter. Mean follicular wall thickness had also reduced significantly in all treatment groups but the effect was more severe in <b>off</b> <b>fed</b> and high zinc dosage group. Food withdrawal and high zinc dosage (30, 000 ppm zinc/kg feed) had highly significantly reduced the mean ovarian follicle number per section compared to Group-II (25, 000 ppm zinc/kg feed) in category ≤ 200 μm. Group-II also showed significant decrease in mean ovarian follicle number in category 201 - 400 μm compared to control group. Histological study showed less number of follicles which possessed unclear and shrunken nuclei, abnormal oocytes with disrupted ooplasm, disrupted zona pellucida layer, absence of demarcation between granulosa and basal lamina, reduction in thickness of follicular epithelium, loose thecal layer with less number of thecal gland and increased number of atretic follicles and stromal tissue arrangement with more interstitial spaces in all treatment groups compared to control group. In Batch-II (Experiment-I) where birds were of 25 weeks of age and were slaughtered after 15 days of withdrawal of all treatments. Due to withdrawal of treatments, regression analysis of variance showed that mean body weight increased significantly in all the previously treated groups. In the case of secondary sexual characteristics comb and wattle length and width were comparable to the control, but in the low zinc treatments comb and wattle length and width increased significantly compared to control. Both in Batch-I and Batch-II zinc deposition in ovary was highly significant compared to the control. In contrast to Batch-I, in Batch-II {{there was no significant difference}} in zinc deposition in kidneys in treatment groups compared to the control. However, as with Batch-I, in Batch-II there was significant deposition of zinc in liver of treated groups compared to the control. Ovarian weight, length and width; oviduct weight and width and weight of liver responded differently after withdrawal of treatments. There was no statistical difference in ovarian weight in treatment groups compared to the controls. However, ovarian length in Group-II and Group-IV was significantly low compared to the control. Similarly, oviduct weight was significantly lower in Group-II and oviduct length was significantly low in Group-II and Group-IV compared to the control. Mean liver weight decreased significantly in Group-II and Group-IV. In Batch-II (Experiment-I) withdrawal of treatments resulted in the increase of plasma estradiol and progesterone in all the treated groups, however, plasma progesterone levels increased to the level of control group. Linear regression analysis of variance showed significant increase in plasma progesterone and estradiol levels with the passage of time. In the case of corticosterone with advancing days of withdrawal of treatments linear regression analysis of variance showed highly significant decrease in concentration in all the three treatment groups. Mean ovarian yolky follicles number and size increased significantly in all the treated groups particularly small sized ovarian yolky follicles and large sized yolky follicles also appeared, which were not present during treatment period. In the case of ovarian follicular diameter there was no significant difference in the treated groups and control birds. However, there was significant reduction in ovarian oocyte diameter category up to 801 - 1000 μm and follicular wall thickness compared to the control. Perhaps, influence of the treatments persisted after withdrawal of the treatments. Re-feeding resulted in the increase in the mean number of ovarian follicles in all the treatment groups. Results of Batch-II showed that the stress of the treatments vanished due to withdrawal of the three treatments. Histological study of Batch-II showed increased number of follicles possessing very clear and spherical nuclei, normal oocytes with ooplasm, zona pellucida layer, very clear demarcation between granulosa and basal lamina, thickness of follicular epithelium improved, compact thecal layer with number of thecal gland and no atretic follicles. The stromal tissue arrangement also improved. Experiment-II was started on the same pattern as that of Experiment-I with the difference that older birds of the age of 67 weeks were used. This experiment was also divided into Batch-I (in which 5 birds were slaughtered after 12 th day of molting) and Batch-II (in which remaining 5 birds were slaughtered after 15 days of withdrawal of all the treatments). In Batch-I (Experiment-II) there were four groups i. e. Control Group; Feed Withdrawal Group; Low zinc dosage (25, 000 ppmzinc/kg feed; High zinc dosage (30, 000 zinc/kg feed. During treatment period the same features, as with Experiment-I, were studied. Compared to the control, body weight was lost highly significantly in feed withdrawal group and both the groups treated with low and high zinc dosage. Mean ovarian weight, length and width, oviduct weight and width as well as liver weight significantly reduced due to these treatments, significant deposition of zinc in ovary, liver and kidney was observed in zinc treatment groups. As in Experiment-I, plasma estradiol and progesterone levels highly significantly decreased. Linear regression analysis of variance showed highly significant decrease in plasma estradiol and progesterone concentration in all treatment groups over the period of 12 days. Corticosterone level increased significantly from 3 rd day of treatment and remained elevated on 6 th, 9 th and 12 th day of experiment compared to the level in Group-I (control). Linear regression analysis of variance showed highly significant increase in plasma corticosterone concentration in all treatment groups with the advance in the days of treatment. Mean ovarian yolky follicle number, ovarian yolky follicles diameter, ovarian follicular diameter, oocyte diameter and follicular wall thickness reduced significantly due to these three treatments. Histomorphological changes showed decrease in number of ovarian follicles, that were disintegrated and disrupted, loose thecal granulosa layer. Large number of atretic follicles, loose thecal layer, scanty thecal glands and disrupted tissue were observed. This was more pronounced in feed withdrawal group (<b>off</b> <b>fed).</b> Stromal tissue in treated groups was loosely arranged and lacunae were also observed. When all the treatments were withdrawn (<b>off</b> <b>fed,</b> low and high zinc dosage), there was significant increase in body weight in all treated groups. Mean comb and wattle length and width increased in all groups during this period, however, in Group-II (<b>off</b> <b>fed)</b> it was still significantly less compared to control group. Ovarian and oviductal weight and length improved significantly. Ovarian length and width was significantly low in Group-II and Group-IV. Similarly, oviductal weight and length also decreased significantly compared to Group-I. Linear regression analysis showed significant increase in estradiol and progesterone levels. There was highly significant decrease in plasma corticosterone concentration in Group-II, Group-III and Group-IV with the advance in the days of withdrawal of treatment. Ovarian yolky follicles number and diameter increased in all treatment groups. Ovarian follicular diameter, number, oocyte diameter and follicular wall thickness also increased significantly. There was significant improvement in histological changes were noted. Restoration of normal follicles, normal nuclei, zona pellucida attached to granulosa layer, and clear granulosa layer with basal lamina and thecal layer, normal thecal gland appeared as was seen in the control, stromal tissue was compact and no lacunae were seen. These results indicate that the treatment stress did not last long. This was neutralized as the treatments were withdrawn and normal feeding was restored. Molting lasted for 12 days. Egg production did not start but post-molting egg production was slow in the three treatment groups compared to the control. The lowest egg production in post-ovulation was seen in <b>off</b> <b>fed</b> grou...|$|R

When it comes to parenting, Clair usually maintains [...] "an allure of cool, calm confidence ... exhibit a strong but gentle parenting stance, one that wasn’t seen on television by a woman of color" [...] at the time, according to Global Grind's Desire Thompson. Clair practices disciplining her children without ever punishing them physically, often delivering punishments [...] "with a calm charm", and raises her four daughters to love and respect themselves. However, she is also known for ranting at her children when she loses her temper, one of her most recognizable of which is the one she gives Vanessa when she attends a concert in Baltimore against her parents' wishes. In the Season 3 episode [...] "The Shower", Denise hosts a wedding shower for a close friend who gets pregnant on purpose to blackmail her parents into letting her marry her fiancé as soon as possible. When Denise broaches the subject of how she would handle a similar situation, Clair sternly – but rather comically – insists that she will never find herself in a similar situation. Despite her seriousness and disciplinarian status, Clair seldom shies away from laughing and participating in fun activities alongside her family as opposed to simply observing them from the sidelines. The character is also fond of relaxing and taking time to herself away from her children whenever necessary.|$|E
60|$|The {{fun that}} was going on at breakfast seemed a mere roar of folly to her, and she had an {{instinct}} of nothing but getting away to Constance. She soon found that there would be opportunity enough, for the tree was to be taken down in a barrow, and all the youthful world was to carry down the decorations in baskets, and help to put them on. She dashed off among the first to put on her things, and then was disappointed to find that first all the pets were to be <b>fed</b> and shown <b>off</b> to Fly, who appreciated them far more than she had done--knew how to lay hold of a rabbit, nursed the guinea-pigs and puppies in turn, and was rapturous in her acceptance of two young guinea-pigs and one puppy.|$|R
50|$|After {{the larvae}} have <b>fed,</b> they drop <b>off</b> the host and molt to nymphs. The nymphs then overwinter and their {{activity}} almost completely ceases until late spring. They emerge {{the following year}} in May, June, and July. This emergence is just before {{the new generation of}} larvae hatch, allowing the nymphs to transmit tick-borne disease to new generations of hosts. This increases the possibility that the next generation of larvae will also become infected. Nymphs usually attach and feed on small mammals and birds. After feeding, nymphs drop off and molt to adults that will reappear in the fall of the same year. Adults seek medium to large mammalian hosts, primarily deer. Once adulthood is reached, ticks no longer hibernate during the winter and may become active on warm winter days.|$|R
50|$|The Marshall {{steam engine}} {{was the main}} driving engine for the saws in the mill, running a flat belt from its flywheel. It, {{along with the other}} steam engines in the mill, was powered by the Stirling boiler, which was <b>fed</b> with timber <b>off</b> cuts. The Stirling boiler was a water- tube boiler, in which the water to be heated was {{contained}} within tubes, with fire passing around the outside-in contrast to fire-tube boilers, which had fire passing through tubes which were surrounded by water. The water-tube type was favoured for larger boilers for safety reasons. Stirling water tube boilers were at their most popular in the early 1900s; many of the 30 or so installed in Victoria between 1904 and 1912 were large boilers for electrical power generation or larger manufacturers. Most activity regarding Stirling boiler installation in Queensland, based on newspaper advertising, appears to be between 1900 and 1914, and the Agent for Queensland in 1903 was Norman M Bell.|$|R
2500|$|Clairmont {{may have}} been sexually {{involved}} with Percy Bysshe Shelley at different periods, though Clairmont's biographers, Gittings and Manton, find no hard evidence. Their friend Thomas Jefferson Hogg joked about [...] "Shelley and his two wives", Mary and Claire, a remark that Clairmont recorded in her own journal. Clairmont was also entirely in sympathy, more so than Mary, with Shelley's theories about free love, communal living, {{and the right of}} a woman to choose her own lovers and initiate sexual contact outside marriage. She seemed to conceive of love as a [...] "triangle" [...] and enjoyed being the third. She had also formed a close friendship with Shelley, who called her [...] "my sweet child" [...] and inspired and <b>fed</b> <b>off</b> his work.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, Bara {{women would}} weave local cotton to make {{clothing}} {{for themselves and}} their family members. Cotton continues to be hand picked, ginned and woven using a high-whorl drop spindle. Raw cotton yarn is typically dipped in a softening solution before weaving; prior to softening, the yarn is called fole velo ("living yarn") and is believed to be imbued with magical powers; ombiasy (village wisemen) may tie this yarn around the wrist for protection or wrap it around the bodies of participants in circumcision ceremonies. [...] Less commonly, clothing was made of silk (landy) produced by the local silkworm that <b>fed</b> <b>off</b> indigenous tapia trees growing in the Isalo area. Although this silk was more coarse and uneven than that produced by the Merina or Betsileo people, throughout the island it was the most prized type of silk because of its durability. In the far eastern part of Bara territory, clothing was most commonly made from beaten bark cloth or mats of harefo (Eleocharis plantagines). Women wore tube dresses made of two to three mats stitched together and tied at the shoulder or belted at the waist, often in combination with a bandeau style top of woven mahampy reeds. Men wore beaten bark cloth loincloths with jackets or tunics formed from stitched woven mats; older men's clothing included sleeves. The wearing of charms is common among the Bara, as elsewhere in Madagascar; charms called tsimokotra were historically crafted from the bones of lemurs' feet to relieve fatigue.|$|E
60|$|The Petite Jeanne? I don't know. The heathen told me {{afterward}} {{that he did}} not know. She {{was literally}} torn apart, ripped wide open, beaten into a pulp, smashed into kindling wood, annihilated. When I came to I was in the water, swimming automatically, though I was about two-thirds drowned. How I got there I had no recollection. I remembered seeing the Petite Jeanne fly to pieces at what must have been the instant that my own consciousness was buffetted out of me. But there I was, with nothing to do but make the best of it, and in that best there was little promise. The wind was blowing again, the sea was much smaller and more regular, and I knew that I had passed through the centre. Fortunately, there were no sharks about. The hurricane had dissipated the ravenous horde that had surrounded the death ship and <b>fed</b> <b>off</b> the dead.|$|E
40|$|On {{radar level}} gauges {{currently}} shipped by Saab Rosemount, some adjustments of the unit's parameters {{has to be}} performed in the field. Presently, this is a cumbersome procedure; the operator {{has to be very}} close to the gauge and he either has to carry with him a bulky configuration unit or use a basic control unit on the gauge. A wireless solution, where a portable device and a receiver replace the control unit, would both allow the operator to work from a distance and eliminate the need for the bulky device. The most conspicuous restraint for such a solution is a very low allowed power dissipation. The {{reason for this is that}} some gauges do not have a separate power supply, but are <b>fed</b> directly <b>off</b> the communication bus. A viable solution should also be commercially available and robust enough to operate in an industrial environment. To meet these requirements both a theoretical and a practical assessment was conducted, where the two techniques for wireless communication, IrDA, and Bluetooth, was given special consideration. As for the portable device, the market for hand-held computers was investigated and ultimately a PDA from Palm was selected for this project. Together with this PDA, a prototype for each of the two wireless techniques was tested to ascertain their performance with respect to power dissipation, communication range, and communication robustness. This investigation revealed that Bluetooth could be used over a much greater distance than IrDA and it did also provide a more robust solution overall. IrDA is nonetheless also a competent technique, and has its primary advantage in terms of much lower power dissipation compared to Bluetooth...|$|R
30|$|The {{experiment}} {{was done by}} challenging the fish with 109 CFU/ml of live S. agalactiae using different routes of infection. The fish (n= 192) were divided into four groups with duplicates. Group 1 (n= 24) were exposed to S. agalactiae through intraperitoneal (IP) route and transferred into the 6 L tank, Group 2 (n= 24) were exposed to S. agalactiae through immersion bath (IM) (5 L of water + 1 L of S. agalactiae broth) for 10 min before being transferred into the 6 L tank and Group 3 (n= 24) were exposed to S. agalactiae through immersion bath (5 L of water + 1 L of S. agalactiae broth) for 10 min with the body of fish being incised (IC) (0.5 cm) at the caudal part before being transferred into the 6 L tank. Group 4 (n= 24) was the control unchallenged group. The fish were kept for 24 h <b>off</b> <b>fed</b> and the clinical signs were observed continuously within 24 h duration of the experiment. The gills, brain, eyes and kidney were collected from three fish four hourly within 24 h. The tissue samples were subjected to bacterial culture, PCR, histopathology and IHC.|$|R
40|$|Motion {{representation}} plays a {{vital role}} in human action recognition in videos. In this study, we introduce a novel compact motion representation for video action recognition, named Optical Flow guided Feature (OFF), which enables the network to distill temporal information through a fast and robust approach. The OFF is derived from the definition of optical flow and is orthogonal to the optical flow. By directly calculating pixel-wise spatio-temporal gradients of the deep feature maps, the OFF could be embedded in any existing CNN based video action recognition framework with only a slight additional cost. It enables the CNN to extract spatio-temporal information, especially the temporal information between frames simultaneously. This simple but powerful idea is validated by experimental results. The network with <b>OFF</b> <b>fed</b> only by RGB inputs achieves a competitive accuracy of 93. 3 % on UCF- 101, which is comparable with the result obtained by two streams (RGB and optical flow), but is 15 times faster in speed. Experimental results also show that OFF is complementary to other motion modalities such as optical flow. When the proposed method is plugged into the state-of-the-art video action recognition framework, it has 96. 0 % accuracy on UCF- 101. The code will be available online...|$|R
