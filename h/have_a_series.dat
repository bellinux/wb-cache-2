5|$|On {{her return}} to America in 1898, Barrymore was lauded by the press and public and, under Charles Frohman's management, she {{appeared}} in Catherine (1898) and Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines (1901) on Broadway. The latter play was a success, and Barrymore received particular praise. She went on to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of similarly popular roles in Cousin Kate (1903), Alice-Sit-by-the-Fire (1905), Lady Frederick (1908) and Déclassée (1920), among others. After a series of less well-received roles in the early 1920s, she returned to popularity with her role as the sophisticated spouse of a philandering husband in The Constant Wife (1927). In 1928 the Ethel Barrymore Theatre was opened in her honor, and she appeared in its inaugural production, The Kingdom of God.|$|E
5|$|Their coat differs geographically, with elands {{in north}} Africa having {{distinctive}} markings (torso stripes, markings on legs, dark garters and a spinal crest) that are absent in the south. Apart from a rough mane, the coat is smooth. Females have a tan coat, while the coats of males are darker, with a bluish-grey tinge. Bulls may also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of vertical white stripes {{on their sides}} (mainly {{in parts of the}} Karoo in South Africa). As males age, their coat becomes more grey. Males also have dense fur on their foreheads and a large dewlap on their throats.|$|E

25|$|The unique {{morphological}} {{characteristics of}} lampreys, {{such as their}} cartilaginous skeleton, suggest they are the sister taxon (see cladistics) of all living jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes), and are usually considered the most basal group of the Vertebrata. Instead of true vertebrae, they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of cartilaginous structures called arcualia arranged above the notochord. Hagfish, which resemble lampreys, have traditionally been considered the sister taxon of the true vertebrates (lampreys and gnathostomes) but DNA evidence suggests {{that they are in}} fact the sister taxon of lampreys.|$|E

25|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} {{originates}} well behind the pelvic fin origins, {{and the second}} originates behind the anal fin origin. The pectoral fins are moderately large, and the dorsal, pelvic, and anal fins are of similar sizes. The caudal fin is short and broad, with a notch near {{the tip of the}} upper lobe and an indistinct lower lobe. The skin is thick and covered by well-calcified leaf-like dermal denticles. The coloration is a plain brown above and white below, though some individuals <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of faint darker saddle-like markings or black or white spots.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical strobe tuners <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of lamps or LEDs {{powered by}} amplified audio from the instrument; they flash (or strobe) {{at the same}} {{frequency}} as the input signal. For instance an 'A' played on a guitar's 6th string at the 5th fret has the frequency of 110 Hz when in tune. An 'A' played on the 1st string at the 5th fret vibrates at 440Hz. As such, the lamps would flash either 110 or 440 times per second in the above examples. In front of these flashing lights is a motor-driven, translucent printed disc with rings of alternating transparent and opaque sectors.|$|E
25|$|Given {{their large}} ranges, {{it is thought}} that bees of the Euglossine tribe trapline for more {{efficient}} foraging. Traplining occurs when an insect will visit a series of flowers in a stable, repeatable sequence. Traplining gives the bee an advantage in that they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of flowers they can visit to gain nectar. There is also a benefit to the flora, which can be many kilometers from each other, but can still be cross-pollinated because they are on the same traplining path. Ef. surinamensis and other orchid bees are major players in flora gene flow, and are vital to the continued health of tropical forests.|$|E
