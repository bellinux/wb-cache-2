Properties investigated included spectral attenuation, polarization mode dispersion (PMD), optical time domain reflectometer characteristics, elastooptic factor describing transmission delay induced by axial strain plus effects of temperature cycling and fiber twist on PMD and loss. In particular, temperature and twist dependence of PMD was different for each fiber tested. For optical measurements, fibers were <b>fusion</b> <b>spliced</b> to pigtails with standard telecom single mode fibers.

50|$|A cleave in {{an optical}} fiber is a deliberate, {{controlled}} break, intended {{to create a}} perfectly flat endface, perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the fiber. The process of cleaving an optical fiber forms one of the steps in the preparation for a fiber splice operation regardless of the subsequent splice being a <b>fusion</b> <b>splice</b> or a mechanical splice; the other steps in the preparation being those of stripping and fiber alignment. A good cleave is required for a successful low loss splice of an optical fiber, often {{it is the case}} that fibers spliced by identical methods tend to have different losses, this difference can often be attributed to the quality of their initial cleaves.|$|E
50|$|The basic fusion {{splicing}} apparatus {{consists of two}} fixtures on which the fibers are mounted and two electrodes. These fixtures are often called sheath clamps. Inspection microscope assists in {{the placement of the}} prepared fiber ends into a fusion-splicing apparatus. The fibers are placed into the apparatus, aligned, and then fused together. Initially, {{fusion splicing}} used nichrome wire as the heating element to melt or fuse fibers together. New fusion-splicing techniques have replaced the nichrome wire with carbon dioxide (CO2) lasers, electric arcs, or gas flames to heat the fiber ends, causing them to fuse together. The small size of the <b>fusion</b> <b>splice</b> and the development of automated fusion-splicing machines have made electric arc fusion (arc fusion) {{one of the most popular}} splicing techniques in commercial applications.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the scheme {{for the study of}} the Bragg {{wavelength}} shift dependence on the applied tensile force. Samples of fiber Bragg gratings with different coatings have been studied: the restored acrylate coating, the heatshrinkable <b>fusion</b> <b>splice</b> protection sleeve without metal rod, the heat-shrinkable <b>fusion</b> <b>splice</b> protection sleeve with a metal rod, the metal capillary, polyvinylchloride tube. For different coatings of diffractive structure, dependences of wavelength shift for the Bragg grating resonance have been obtained on the tensile strength applied to the ends of an optical fiber. It was determined that the studied FBG coatings give the possibility to reduce the mechanical impact on the Bragg wavelength shift for 1. 1 - 15 times as compared to an uncoated waveguide. The most effective version of coated fiber Bragg grating is the heatshrinkable <b>fusion</b> <b>splice</b> protection sleeve with a metal rod. When the force (equal to 6 N) is applied to the 100 mm optical fiber area with the inscribed diffractive structure, the Bragg wavelength shift is 7. 5 nm for the unprotected sample and 0. 5 nm for the one coated with the heat-shrinkable <b>fusion</b> <b>splice</b> protection sleeve...|$|E

40|$|Optical fibers {{transmit}} data when light {{waves are}} propagated through them. Optical fibers have many applications at LLE, {{such as the}} fiber-optic switch module in the ROSS streak camera. 1 It is often necessary to splice two fibers together by a process called fiber-optic fusion splicing. There are two significant sources of optical power loss in a fiber: unoptimized splices and losses contributed by the connectorization of the fiber ends. In {{order to ensure that}} a splice is optimized it is necessary to have an apparatus that will measure just the loss of optical power caused by the splice, account for power fluctuations of the laser used to test the fiber, and do so accurately enough to measure low loss. A ratiometer was constructed that measures only the power loss induced from the splice and can measure losses as low as 0. 5 %. The ratiometer splits the beam into two paths. One path serves as the reference (reference fiber), and the other path contains the fiber being tested (fiber under test). Each fiber has a connector on both ends. Samples of power measurements are made before and after a <b>fusion</b> <b>splice.</b> This sampling process allows the energy loss contribution of the connectors to be eliminated. Using the ratiometer, an amended fusion-splicing program has been shown to reduce the loss in a splice from between 1. 0 dB (20 %) and 2. 6 dB (45 %) to 0. 1 dB (~ 2 %). ...|$|E

40|$|NTT Photonics Laboratories has {{proposed}} and enhanced the multi-chip PLC integration technology that directly connects multiple planar lightwave cir-cuits (PLCs) {{as a platform}} technology that enables smaller advanced optical modules for dense wave-length division multiplexing (DWDM) at lower cost [1]. This technology easily eliminates or overcomes the major barriers such as poor yields and insufficient versatility that exist with monolithically integrated optical circuits. In addition, high-performance mod-ules can be implemented since this technology {{makes it possible to}} manufacture individual optical circuits with optimal designs and manufacturing conditions. The V-AWG, which is a combination of a variable optical attenuator (VOA) and an arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) wavelength division multiplexer, is the first complex function-integrated PLC module for practical applications (Fig. 1). This module consists of a VOA achieved using a Mach-Zehnder interfer-ometer (MZI) using the thermo-optic effect, a power tap circuit utilizing a wavelength insensitive coupler (WINC), a monitor photodiode (PD), an AWG wave-length division multiplexer, and an electronic control board that provides intelligent control of these optical parts. We have focused on the research and development of the V-AWG as the first application of multi-chip PLC integration technology [2]. This technology suc-ceeds in drastically reducing the size of the module because the space previously needed for fiber routing, optical connectors, and <b>fusion</b> <b>splice</b> joints is no longer required. Moreover, the decreased number of connection points with single-mode fiber yields a major improvement in insertion loss if the optical waveguides have a high refractive index difference A photograph of the interior of a manufactured ultrasmall 8 -channel V-AWG module is shown i...|$|E

50|$|Stripping is {{the act of}} {{removing}} the protective polymer coating around optical fiber in preparation for <b>fusion</b> <b>splicing.</b> The splicing process begins by preparing both fiber ends for fusion, which requires that all protective coating is removed or stripped from the ends of each fiber.

25|$|<b>Fusion</b> <b>splicing</b> is {{done with}} a {{specialized}} instrument. The fiber ends are first stripped of their protective polymer coating (as well as the more sturdy outer jacket, if present). The ends are cleaved (cut) with a precision cleaver to make them perpendicular, and are placed into special holders in the <b>fusion</b> <b>splicer.</b> The splice is usually inspected via a magnified viewing screen to check the cleaves {{before and after the}} splice. The splicer uses small motors to align the end faces together, and emits a small spark between electrodes at the gap to burn off dust and moisture. Then the splicer generates a larger spark that raises the temperature above the melting point of the glass, fusing the ends together permanently. The location and energy of the spark is carefully controlled so that the molten core and cladding do not mix, and this minimizes optical loss. A splice loss estimate is measured by the splicer, by directing light through the cladding on one side and measuring the light leaking from the cladding on the other side. A splice loss under 0.1dB is typical. The complexity of this process makes fiber splicing much more difficult than splicing copper wire.|$|R
