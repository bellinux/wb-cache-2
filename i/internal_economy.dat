The presence of <b>internal</b> <b>economies</b> in the intermediate good sector gives rise to external economies in the production of the final good sector.

25|$|Although {{numerous}} naval battles {{took place}} before the 12th century, such as the large-scale Three Kingdoms Battle of Chibi in the year 208, {{it was during the}} Song Dynasty (960–1279 AD) that the Chinese established a permanent, standing navy in 1132 AD. At its height by the late 12th century there were 20 squadrons of some 52,000 marines, with the admiral's headquarters at Dinghai, while the main base remained closer to modern Shanghai in those days. The establishment of the permanent navy during the Song period came out of the need to defend against the Jurchens, who had overrun the northern half of China, and to escort merchant fleets entering the South East Pacific and Indian Ocean on long trade missions abroad to the Hindu, Islamic, and East African spheres of the world. However, considering China was a country which was longtime menaced by land-based nomadic tribes such as the Xiongnu, Göktürks, Mongols and so on, the navy was always seen as an adjunct rather than an important military force. By the 1516th centuries China's canal system and <b>internal</b> <b>economy</b> were sufficiently developed to nullify the need for the Pacific fleet, which was scuttled when conservative Confucianists gained power in the court and began a policy of introspection. After the First and Second Opium Wars, which shook up the generals of the Qing dynasty, the government attached greater importance to the navy.|$|E
40|$|Much {{research}} on agglomeration economies, and particularly recent work that builds on Marshall’s {{concept of the}} industrial district, postulates that benefits derived from proximity between businesses are strongest for small enterprises (Humphrey 1995, Sweeney and Feser 1998). With <b>internal</b> <b>economies</b> {{a function of the}} shape of the average cost curve and level of production, and external economies in shifts of that curve, a small firm enjoying external economies characteristic of industrial districts (or complexes or simply urbanized areas) may face the same average costs as the larger firm producing a higher volume of output (Oughton and Whittam 1997; Carlsson 1996; Humphrey 1995). Thus we observe the seeming paradox of large firms that enjoy <b>internal</b> <b>economies</b> of scale co-existing with smaller enterprises that should, by all accounts, be operating below minimum efficient scale. With the Birch-inspired debate on the relative job- and innovation-generating capacity of small and large firms abating (Ettlinger 1997), {{research on}} the small firm sector has shifted to an examination of the business strategies and sources of competitiveness of small enterprises (e. g., Pratten 1991, Nooteboom 1993).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between <b>internal</b> schooling <b>economies</b> and transportation costs with regard to consolidation of rural schools. The consolidation question was conceptualized as a programming problem where the objective was to simultaneously minimize the sum of schooling and transportation costs. Both linear and separable programming models were used. Model solutions indicated that some consolidation of schools in the study area would minimize costs but total cost savings were relatively small. Key words: <b>internal</b> schooling <b>economies,</b> transportation costs, school consolidation, linear programming, separable programming, cost minimization. The advisability of rural school consolidation turns on many different issues. Parents of students voice concern about loss of local control, long bus rides, and fewer real oppor-tunities for extracurricular activities. Public officials and their advisors often seem to con-centrate on what are viewed as the economics of the question. Since schooling is apparently a process that is characterized by <b>internal</b> <b>economies</b> of size, major cost savings should be obtainable through consolidation of rural schools which are too small. 1 What is often missing in policy deliberations is explicit recognition of the cost of transport-ing students. If large increases in transporta-tion costs are associated with consolidation, then recommendations based mainly upon presumed savings from size economies are likely to be wrong.
