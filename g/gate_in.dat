5|$|Early records {{mention a}} west <b>gate</b> <b>in</b> 1180, a south <b>gate</b> <b>in</b> 1214, and the Netherbow Port in 1369. In 1362 the Wellhouse Tower was built beneath the north {{wall of the}} castle, {{protecting}} the castle's water supply, and defending the approach along the south shore of the Nor Loch.|$|E

25|$|Level 1 of the {{terminal}} contains baggage carousels and ground transportation access. Level 2 contains ticketing/check-in, shopping and dining, {{and access to the}} concourses. The airport currently has two immigration and customs facilities (FIS), located in Concourse D, Level 3 and in Concourse J, Level 3. The Concourse D FIS can be utilized by flights arriving at all <b>gates</b> <b>in</b> Concourse E and all <b>gates</b> <b>in</b> Concourses D and some <b>gates</b> <b>in</b> Concourse F. The Concourse J FIS can be utilized by flights arriving at all <b>gates</b> <b>in</b> Concourse J and most <b>gates</b> <b>in</b> Concourse H. However, all <b>gates</b> <b>in</b> Concourse G and some <b>gates</b> <b>in</b> Concourses F and H, do not have the facilities to route passengers to any FIS, and therefore can only be used for domestic arrivals. MIA is unique among American airports in that all of its facilities are common-use, meaning that they are assigned by the airport and no one airline holds ownership or leases on any terminal space or gates, thus giving the airport much more flexibility <b>in</b> terminal and <b>gate</b> assignments and allowing it to make full use of existing facilities. The entire airport became common-use by the 1990s.|$|R

50|$|The fort had <b>gates</b> <b>in</b> {{the south}} and west walls. There may have been <b>gates</b> <b>in</b> the other walls but no sign of them has been found. The walls were of {{sandstone}} ashlar, backed by a clay bank thirty feet thick.|$|R
5|$|In 2005, after a {{match between}} Glentoran and rival team Linfield, Linfield fans broke down a <b>gate</b> <b>in</b> The Oval {{to access the}} pitch and throw objects at Glentoran fans in the main stand after both sets of fans had been {{throwing}} missiles at each other beforehand. Two people were charged with rioting.|$|E
5|$|Maria Limanskaya (also mistakenly {{referred}} to as Anna Pavlova) was a female soldier of the Red Army for three years during World War II.

She has since become a symbol of the Allied victory over Nazi Germany.|$|E
5|$|Marina Curtain, {{also known}} as Liesse Curtain – curtain wall linking St. Peter & St. Paul and St. Barbara Bastions. It {{originally}} contained Del Monte Gate, which was demolished and replaced by Victoria <b>Gate</b> <b>in</b> the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|In 1972 rotundas {{were added}} to the end of each dock to allow more <b>gates.</b> <b>In</b> the later 1970s growth in {{regional}} air travel created a need for more <b>gates.</b> <b>In</b> 1980 the South East Dock was opened. Even with these expansions, the terminal was too small.|$|R

5|$|St. Anne Curtain – {{curtain wall}} linking St. Philip and St. Francis Bastions. It {{contained}} St. Anne's Gate, which {{was replaced by}} a larger <b>gate</b> <b>in</b> 1859. The larger gate was also demolished in 1897 to facilitate the flow of traffic.|$|E
5|$|The {{restoration}} of Tōdai-ji's Nandaimon <b>gate</b> <b>in</b> 1930 saw improved standards for preservation. An architect supervised the reconstruction works on-site. Extensive restoration reports became the norm, including plans, results of surveys, historical sources, and {{documentation of the}} work done. During the 1930s, about 70–75% of restoration costs came from the national budget, which increased even during the war.|$|E
5|$|While {{relaying}} the deteriorated {{floor of}} Akbari <b>Gate</b> <b>in</b> April 2007, three floors in the fort were unearthed {{belonging to the}} British, Sikh and Mughal period. The floor of the British, Sikh and Mughal periods were constructed with bricks, burnt bricks and pebbles respectively. The latter either built during Jahangir's or Shah Jahan's era was the hallmark of Mughals.|$|E

5|$|A 16th-century water <b>gate</b> <b>in</b> {{the eastern}} {{wall of the}} Upper Bailey gives access to {{the shore of the}} loch. The {{adjacent}} buildings may have housed the stables. To the south of this, opposite the motte, is the base of a doocot (pigeon house) and the scant remains of 13th-century buildings, possibly once a great hall but more recently re-used as a smithy.|$|E
5|$|A second {{access to}} the castle leads up from a rocky cove, the {{aperture}} to a marine cave on the northern side of the Dunnottar cliffs into which a small boat could be brought. From here a steep path leads to the well-fortified postern gate on the cliff top, which in turn offers {{access to the}} castle via the Water <b>Gate</b> <b>in</b> the palace. Artillery defences, taking the form of earthworks, surround the north-west corner of the castle, facing inland, and the south-east, facing seaward. A small sentry box or guard house stands by the eastern battery, overlooking the coast.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{southern}} foes {{were still}} very alive, Cao Cao focused {{to the north}} to crush Ma Chao and his rebels at Tong <b>Gate</b> <b>in</b> 211 AD ("Tales"). He also chooses to defend against Lu Bu, who is terrorizing Xiapi, and in a fireattack, he ends Lu Bu's Offensive ("Tales"). Cao Cao's generals then destroy {{the army of the}} alive Dong Zhuo piecemeal at Ji Province ("Tales"), and he eradicates all of his foes. Cao Cao then chooses to go after Shu or Wu, depending on the result of the Chibi fire attack.|$|E

5|$|Built {{predominantly}} of Old Red Sandstone, {{the bridge}} {{was the subject of}} significant reconstruction and rebuilding in the 18th and 19th centuries. In those centuries, it also became a popular subject for artists; Turner, Gastineau and Cotman produced sketches of the bridge and <b>gate.</b> <b>In</b> the 20th century, it suffered increasing damage as higher volumes of traffic and the use of ever-larger vehicles led to several serious accidents. In the 21st century, {{the construction of a new}} road crossing to the south enabled the pedestrianisation of the bridge.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century, {{traffic was}} {{struggling}} {{along the narrow}} streets south of Holbein Gate, which led to King Street Gate being demolished in 1723. Holbein <b>Gate,</b> <b>in</b> turn, was demolished in 1759. Meanwhile, Parliament Street was a side road alongside the palace, leading to the Palace of Westminster. After the Palace of Whitehall was destroyed, Parliament Street was widened to match Whitehall's width. The present appearance of the street dates from 1899 after a group of houses between Downing Street and Great George Street were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the DR had been extended to Richmond, Ealing Broadway, Hounslow West and Wimbledon in the west and to New Cross <b>Gate</b> <b>in</b> the east. The southern section of the Inner Circle was suffering considerable congestion between South Kensington and Mansion House, between which stations the DR was running an average of 20 trains per hour with more in the peak periods.|$|E

5|$|Chōdō-in was a {{rectangular}} walled enclosure situated {{directly to the}} north of the Suzakumon <b>gate</b> <b>in</b> the centre of the southern wall of the Greater Palace. It was based on Chinese models and followed Chinese architectural styles, and archaeological evidence from earlier capitals shows that this building complex was present in earlier palaces and had a remarkably stable design from the 7th century onwards.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Wat Tyler's entrance in 1381, in 1450, Jack Cade and 4,000 rebels were barred entry {{from the city}} at West <b>Gate.</b> <b>In</b> 1533, Canterbury reacted with concern to the news of Thomas Wyatt's rebellion in Kent; repairs {{were made to the}} walls, guns and ammunition mobilised, and the Riding Gate was blocked up. Queen Mary later thanked the city for their efforts.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, the Japanese were {{gaining the}} upper hand over the hard-pressed and {{surrounded}} Chinese defenders. On December 12 the SEA captured Peak #2 of Zijinshan and {{from this vantage point}} unleashed a torrent of artillery fire at Zhongshan Gate where {{a large portion of the}} wall suddenly gave way. After sunset the fires that blazed out of control on Zijinshan were visible even from Zhonghua <b>Gate</b> <b>in</b> the south which was completely occupied by Japan's 10th Army on the night of December 12 to 13.|$|E
