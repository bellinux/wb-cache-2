25|$|The key {{advantage}} of the four-rail system is that neither running rail carries any current. This scheme was introduced because {{of the problems of}} return currents, intended to be carried by the earthed (grounded) running rail, flowing through the iron tunnel linings instead. This can cause electrolytic damage and even arcing if the tunnel segments are not electrically bonded together. The problem was exacerbated because the return current also had a tendency to flow through nearby iron pipes forming the water and gas mains. Some of these, particularly Victorian mains that predated London's underground railways, were not constructed to carry currents and had no adequate <b>electrical</b> <b>bonding</b> between pipe segments. The four-rail system solves the problem. Although the supply has an artificially created earth point, this connection is derived by using resistors which ensures that stray earth currents are kept to manageable levels. Power-only rails can be mounted on strongly insulating ceramic chairs to minimise current leak, but this is not possible for running rails which have to be seated on stronger metal chairs to carry the weight of trains. However, elastomeric rubber pads placed between the rails and chairs can now solve part of the problem by insulating the running rails from the current return should there be a leakage through the running rails.|$|E

Even if the connection to a distant earth ground is lost, the occupant will be protected from dangerous potential differences.|$|E

50|$|Yield {{strength}} is increased in a cold-worked material. Using lattice strain fields, {{it can be}} shown that an environment filled with dislocations will hinder the movement of any one dislocation. Because dislocation motion is hindered, plastic deformation cannot occur at normal stresses. Upon application of stresses just beyond the yield strength of the non-cold-worked material, a cold-worked material will continue to deform using the only mechanism available: elastic deformation, the regular scheme of stretching or compressing of <b>electrical</b> <b>bonds</b> (without dislocation motion) continues to occur, and the modulus of elasticity is unchanged. Eventually the stress is great enough to overcome the strain-field interactions and plastic deformation resumes.|$|R

This results in designs with large margins of safety and complex inspection operations. In addition, by increasing the relative fraction of composite components within new aircraft, challenges regarding electrical conductivity have arisen such as lightning strike protection, static discharge, <b>electrical</b> <b>bonding</b> and grounding, interference shielding and current return through the structure.

Without sufficient plasma treatment, internal layer copper features receive inadequate polymer removal which results in circuit discontinuity during the plating process. Additionally, the plasma serves to roughen the polymer wall of drilled holes which improves copper adhesion. To ensure proper plasma treatment, careful adherence to strict production guidelines is essential. These guidelines include attention to several critical criteria in placement, pretreatment and treatment of the PWBs during the plasma process; process verification via post plasma testing; and careful process monitoring throughout. In this brief, some guidelines for process monitoring and control will be discussed.

40|$|At {{millimeter}} dimension or less, {{the conventional}} bonding technology in electronic assembly {{relies heavily on}} reflow soldering and suffers from severe performance and reliability degradation. Meanwhile, the traditional high temperature bonding process (easily reach 220 oC) tends to result in undesired thermal damage and residual stress at the bonding interface.

Breakup of a perfectly conducting, incompressible Newtonian liquid jet surrounded by a passive insulating gas that is stressed by a radial electric field is studied by a temporal analysis. An initially quiescent jet is subjected to axially periodic shape perturbations and the ensuing dynamics are followed numerically until pinch-off by both a threedimensional but axisymmetric (two-dimensional) and a one-dimensional slender-jet algorithm. Results computed with these algorithms are verified against predictions from linear theory for short times. Breakup times, ratios of the sizes of the primary to satellite drops formed at pinch-off, and the Coulombic stability of these drops are reported {{over a wide range}} of <b>electrical</b> <b>Bond</b> numbers, NE (ratio of electric to surface tension force), Ohnesorge numbers, NOh (ratio of viscous to surface tension force), and disturbance wavenumbers, k.

The amount of erosion on M 1 as well as what type of overlap is created on M 2 both affect M 2 polish. We find that the M 2 polish creates additional array recess, but the amount of additional recess is smaller when the M 2 array resides in a previous M 1 array recess region.

These cells, {{referred to as}} TOC (Task Order Contract) cells, were fourth generation cells, and incorporated design improvements to extend operating life. GS 526 glass had been added to suppress the loss of Ge from the MoGe bond between the SiGe and the barrier graphite. The previous generation was life limited by the degradation of this <b>electrical</b> <b>bond</b> at the SiGe to graphite hot side interface due to the Ge loss.

When the cell was removed from the test fixture, separation occurred between the hot side compliant pad facesheet and the niobium filament bundles.

40|$|Fast atom beam {{activated}} direct wafer bonds {{can be used}} {{to combine}} GaAs and Si semiconductor structures and to achieve high bond strength and optical transparency. Some applications require a low ohmic resistance between the materials. Therefore, IV-characteristics of n-type wafer bonds between n-Si and n-GaAs were thoroughly investigated. n-Si/n-Si bonds showed ohmic resistance below 2. 5 × 10 − 3 cm 2. However diode like IV-curves were found for both n-GaAs/n-GaAs and n-Si/n-GaAs bonds. This {{can be explained by the}} formation of a potential barrier at the interface, caused by carrier trapping in fast atom beam induced defects. Hall measurements of n-GaAs after fast atom beam treatment confirmed both, a reduction of the active carrier concentration, and the electron mobility. It was found that thermal annealing and higher bond temperatures can help reducing the potential barrier height at the n-Si/n-GaAs interface and thus lower the <b>electrical</b> <b>bond</b> resistance by healing crystalline defects. Highly conductive n-Si/n-GaAs wafer bonds with an interface resistance below 3. 6 × 10 − 3 cm 2 were achieved after the optimization. © 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

The amount of force required to fully compress the test article in the sealing interface and the force needed to separate the joint were also measured. The outgassing and resistance measurements were below the maximum allowable levels.

40|$|The present work on radial {{electric}} field induced jet breakup {{is an extension}} of our recent work (Lakdawala et al., 20150) on surface tension force induced jet breakup. A Dual Grid Level Set Method (DGLSM) based numerical study on the non-linear breakup of viscous liquid jets immersed in another viscous fluid under radial {{electric field}} is carried out in this work. This leads {{to a better understanding of}} the mechanism of electrocapillary jet breakup and subsequent formation of primary and satellite drops, due to the temporal growth of surface perturbation. The influence of the <b>electrical</b> <b>Bond</b> number (B-oe) and Reynolds number (Re) on the growth rate, the breakup time, the volume of the primary and satellite drops, and the charge of both primary and satellite drops is analyzed. An excellent agreement of the present numerical with the published analytical results is obtained for different Reynolds numbers (Re = 10, 100), wave numbers (0 < k <= 1) and electric Bond number (0 < B-oe < 4). The results show that electrostatic stresses stabilize the long waves and destabilize the short waves which are in accord with linear stability theory: confirming the robustness of our DGLSM method in simulating two-phase electrohydrodynamic flow. The results indicate that nonlinear contribution from the electrostatic force is very important in analyzing the mechanism of satellite formation. The numerical results reveal that the satellite formation as well as the breakup time is affected significantly when the effect of conduction is weak. For large conduction, the evolution of the thread is close to those obtained for a perfectly conducting core fluid. Finally, we numerically show that the local dynamics may be altered when the conduction is weak compared to the perfect conductor limit. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Carbon fibre {{reinforced}} polymers (CFRP) {{are increasingly}} used for structures on aircraft {{due to their}} superior mechanical properties compared to traditional materials, such as aluminium. Additionally, {{in order to improve}} aircraft performance, there is a continued trend for electrically driven loads on aircraft, increasing the on-board electrical power generation capacity and complexity of the electrical power system, including a desire to increase voltage levels and move towards DC distribution systems. Central to the reliable operation of an electrical power system is the development of an appropriate protection and fault management strategy. If an electrical earth fault occurs on a composite more-electric aircraft then the CFRP may form part of the route to ground. In order to develop an appropriate protection system and thus to understand the effects on engine generators it is necessary to investigate the fault response of this network. Hence a suitable electrical model of the CFRP material is required, which will enable CFRP to be included in a computationally-intensive systems-level simulation study of a more-electric aircraft (MEA) with fully switching power electronic converter models. This paper presents an experimentally validated impedance model of CFRP at an appropriate level of fidelity for use in systems level simulation platforms, enabling appropriate protection methods to be developed. The validated model considers the impact of the <b>electrical</b> <b>bonding</b> to ground, including the impedance added by a metallic frame that a CFRP panel may be mounted in.

Testing consisted of subjecting the lightning evaluation test article to simulated {{lightning strike}}s and evaluating {{the effects of}} instrumentation cable transients on cables within the system tunnel. The maximum short-circuit current induced onto a United Space Boosters, Inc., operational flight cable within the systems tunnel was 92 A, and the maximum induced open-circuit voltage was 316 V. These levels were extrapolated to the worst-case (200 kA) condition of NASA specification NSTS 07636 and were also scaled to full-scale redesigned solid rocket motor dimensions. Testing showed that voltage coupling to cables within the systems tunnel can be reduced 40 to 90 dB and that current coupling to cables within the systems tunnel can be reduced 30 to 70 dB {{with the use of}} braided metallic sock shields around cables that are external to the systems tunnel. Testing also showed that current and voltage levels induced onto cables within the systems tunnel are partially dependant on the cables' relative locations within the systems tunnel. Results of current injections to the systems tunnel indicate that the dominant coupling mode on cables within the systems tunnel is not from instrumentation cables but from coupling through the systems tunnel cover seam apertures. It is recommended that methods of improving the <b>electrical</b> <b>bonding</b> between individual sections of the systems tunnel covers be evaluated.

40|$|Adhesives are {{increasingly}} being employed as alternatives to mechanical fasteners in aerospace and other engineering applications. While structural adhesives are commonly employed on aircraft, <b>electrical</b> <b>bonding</b> continues to be achieved with rivets as the existing electrically conductive adhesives suffer from low strength due to the high loading (typically 25 - 30 vol. %) of conductive filler particles. Carbon nanotubes {{are one of the}} more attractive candidates for development of multifunctional adhesives for both structural and conductive bonding because of their high conductivity and high aspect ratio. The latter enables creation of conductive pathways at much lower loading (< 1 vol. %) and, therefore, conductivity can be achieved without degrading mechanical performance. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) offer the highest intrinsic conductivity and aspect ratio as well as the lowest percolation threshold, which is associated with higher conductivity at a fixed loading. In this work, SWCNTs were incorporated at low loading (0. 5 - 3 wt%) into an unfilled aerospace-grade epoxy system, to impart electrical conductivity while maintaining structural bonding capability. Mechanical properties of composite-tocomposite joints were evaluated using ASTM-based lap shear and peel tests. Bulk electrical conductivities over 1 S/m were achieved without degrading the joint structural performance in the selected test methods. The mechanical and electrical performance of a SWCNT-modified epoxy adhesive was also studied for aluminumto- aluminum bonding. It was found that the integration of 1 wt% SWCNTs can considerably improve joint Mode I fracture toughness by ~ 35 % due to mechanisms such as crack bridging. The electrical resistance of the bondline was also consistent with the electrical conductivity of SWCNT-modified adhesive films (~ 10 - 3 S/m), but slightly lower than the bulk electrical conductivity measured on thicker samples.
