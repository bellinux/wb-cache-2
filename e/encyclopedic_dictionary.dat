Then came Raja Radhakanta Deb's Sabdakalpadrum (1822–1858), a Sanskrit <b>encyclopedic</b> <b>dictionary</b> in eight parts. Next was Rajkrishna Ray (1849–1894) and Saratchandra Dev's (1858-unknown) joint work Bharatkosh, the first Bengali encyclopedia laid-out in alphabetical order (1880–1892) published in three volumes. Reverend Krishna Mohan Banerjee's (1813–1885) adaptation of Encyclopædia Britannica, Vidyakalpadruma or Encyclopædia Bengalensis (1846–51), and the 22-volume Bangla Visvakosh (1886–1911), edited by Nagendranath Basu (1866–1938) with contributions from many major personalities of contemporary Bengal, were published next.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This article {{presents}} {{the problems and}} challenges of dealing with encyclopedic information in Shona lexicography. According to Zgusta (1971 : 198), <b>encyclopedic</b> <b>dictionaries</b> are primarily concerned with the denotata of the lexical units. They give information about the extra-linguistic world, physical or non-physical. In other words, <b>encyclopedic</b> <b>dictionaries</b> contain extensive information on lexical entries. The arti-cle focuses on how such encyclopedic information is collected, selected, entered and treated. Emphasis is on identifying the problems and challenges experienced by lexicographers at the four main stages of dictionary making. It also presents solutions to the encountered difficulties. It brings out discernible patterns {{in the treatment of}} encyclopedic information. The analysis, from the collection stage up to the treatment stage, is done with reference to the relatively long history of compiling linguistic dictionaries in Shona...|$|R

25|$|Karl Popper {{tried to}} {{establish}} a criterion of demarcation between science and metaphysics, but the speculative turn taken by certain developments in theoretical physics has contributed to muddle the issue again. Mosterín has been concerned {{with the question of}} the reliability of theories and claims. He makes a distinction between the standard core of a scientific discipline, that at a certain point in time should only include relatively reliable and empirically supported ideas, and the cloud of speculative hypotheses surrounding it. Part of the theoretical progress consists in the incorporation of newly tested hypotheses of the cloud to the standard core. In this connection, he has analyzed epistemic notions like detection and observation. Observation, but not detection, is accompanied by awareness. Detection is always mediated by technological instruments, but observation only sometimes (like glasses in vision). The signals received by detectors have to be transduced into types of energy accessible to our senses. Following the path open by Patrick Suppes, Mosterín has paid much attention to the structure of metric concepts, because of their indispensable mediating role at the interface between theory and observation where reliability is tested. He has also made contributions to the study of mathematical modeling and of the limits of the axiomatic method in the characterization of real-world structures. The real world is extremely complex, and sometimes {{the best we can do}} is to apply the method of theoretical science: to pick up in the set-theoretical universe a mathematical structure with some formal similarities with the situation we are interested in, and use it as a model of that parcel of the world. Together with Roberto Torretti, Mosterín has written a uniquely comprehensive <b>encyclopedic</b> <b>dictionary</b> of logic and philosophy of science.|$|E
