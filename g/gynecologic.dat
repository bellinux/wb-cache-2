5|$|Mickal was {{the first}} player from LSU to ever be drafted into the NFL, {{selected}} in the sixth round of the 1936 NFL Draft by the Detroit Lions. However, he did not play in the NFL. He instead chose to complete his medical degree at the Louisiana State University School of Medicine, where he graduated from in 1940. He served as a major in the U.S. Army Medical Corps during World War II. After the war, he worked in {{obstetrics and gynecology at}} New Orleans Charity Hospital from 1946 to 1949, shortly after which he was hired to the LSU medical faculty. In 1959, he became the head professor of the LSU Medical School, a position he served in until his retirement in 1980. He was {{a founding member of the}} Society of <b>Gynecologic</b> Oncology and the Infectious Disease Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, and served as president of the Society of <b>Gynecologic</b> Surgeons from 1981 to 1982. From 1985 until his death in 2001 he was vice president for medical affairs at Kenner Regional Medical Center.|$|E
5|$|Endometrial cancer {{frequently}} metastasizes to {{the ovaries}} and Fallopian tubes when the cancer {{is located in}} {{the upper part of the}} uterus, and the cervix when the cancer is in the lower part of the uterus. The cancer usually first spreads into the myometrium and the serosa, then into other reproductive and pelvic structures. When the lymphatic system is involved, the pelvic and para-aortic nodes are usually first to become involved, but in no specific pattern, unlike cervical cancer. More distant metastases are spread by the blood and often occur in the lungs, as well as the liver, brain, and bone. Endometrial cancer metastasizes to the lungs 20–25% of the time, more than any other <b>gynecologic</b> cancer.|$|E
25|$|It is {{the most}} deadly <b>gynecologic</b> cancer.|$|E
25|$|Once it is {{determined}} that ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer is present, treatment is scheduled by a <b>gynecologic</b> oncologist (a physician trained to treat cancers of a woman’s reproductive system). <b>Gynecologic</b> oncologists can perform surgery on and give chemotherapy to women with ovarian cancer. A treatment plan is developed.|$|E
25|$|Vulvar {{cancer causes}} less than 1% of all cancer cases and deaths but around 6% of all <b>gynecologic</b> cancers {{diagnosed}} in the UK. Around 1,200 women {{were diagnosed with}} the disease in 2011, and 400 women died in 2012. Vulvar cancer causes about 0. 6% of all cancer cases but 5% of <b>gynecologic</b> cancers in the United States. About 4900 cases are diagnosed {{each year in the}} United States.|$|E
25|$|Examination of the vulva {{is part of}} the <b>gynecologic</b> {{evaluation}} and should include a thorough inspection of the perineum, including areas around the clitoris and urethra, and palpation of the Bartholin's glands.|$|E
25|$|For the ovarian {{hyperstimulation}} in itself, injectable gonadotropins (usually FSH analogues) {{are generally}} used under close monitoring. Such monitoring frequently checks the estradiol level and, {{by means of}} <b>gynecologic</b> ultrasonography, follicular growth. Typically approximately 10 days of injections will be necessary.|$|E

25|$|Vulvar {{cancer is}} a malignant, {{invasive}} growth in the vulva, or the outer portion of the female genitals. The disease accounts for only 0.6% of cancer diagnoses but 5% of <b>gynecologic</b> cancers in the United States. The labia majora {{are the most common}} site involved representing about 50% of all cases, followed by the labia minora. The clitoris and Bartholin glands may rarely be involved.|$|E
25|$|Industrialized nations, {{with the}} {{exception}} of Japan, have high rates of epithelial ovarian cancer, which may be due to diet in those countries. Caucasian are at a 30–40% higher risk for ovarian cancer when compared to Black and Hispanic people, likely due to socioeconomic factors; white women tend to have fewer children and different rates of <b>gynecologic</b> surgeries that affect risk for ovarian cancer.|$|E
25|$|Labial {{reduction}} can {{be performed}} under local anaesthesia, conscious sedation, or general anaesthesia, either as a discrete, single surgery, or in conjunction with another, <b>gynecologic</b> or cosmetic, surgery procedure. The resection proper is facilitated with the administration of an anaesthetic solution (lidocaine + epinephrine in saline solution) that is infiltrated to the labia minora to achieve the tumescence (swelling) of the tissues and the constriction of the pertinent labial circulatory system, the hemostasis that limits bleeding.|$|E
25|$|The first {{contraceptive}} {{trial of}} Enovid led by Celso-Ramón García and Edris Rice-Wray began in April 1956 in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico.–|isbn=0-19-515456-8}} A second contraceptive trial of Enovid (and norethisterone) led by Edward T. Tyler began in June 1956 in Los Angeles. On January 23, 1957, Searle held a symposium reviewing <b>gynecologic</b> and contraceptive research on Enovid through 1956 and concluded Enovid's estrogen content {{could be reduced}} by 33% to lower the incidence of estrogenic gastrointestinal side effects without significantly increasing the incidence of breakthrough bleeding.|$|E
25|$|Mercy Medical Center {{is home to}} the Leonard P. Nelson Family Cancer Treatment Center (est. 1996), {{providing}} oncology {{services in}} the region for the past seventeen years to an area of a 100-mile radius. Patients receive treatment {{for a wide variety of}} cancers including breast, <b>gynecologic,</b> head and neck, lung and prostate. Mercy Medical Center broke ground 24 August 2012 on an expanded cancer treatment facility. Improvements include the installation of a highly specialized linear accelerator to increase precision radiation therapy treatment delivery with decreased patient treatment time. The grand opening was 7 October 2013.|$|E
25|$|Staging and {{treatment}} are generally handled by an oncologist familiar with <b>gynecologic</b> cancer. Surgery is {{a mainstay of}} therapy depending on anatomical staging and is usually reserved for cancers that have not spread beyond the vulva. Surgery may involve a wide local excision, radical partial vulvectomy, or radical complete vulvectomy with removal of vulvar tissue, inguinal and femoral lymph nodes. In cases of early vulvar cancer, the surgery may be less extensive and consist of wide excision or a simple vulvectomy. Surgery is significantly more extensive when the cancer has spread to nearby organs such as the urethra, vagina, or rectum. Complications of surgery include wound infection, sexual dysfunction, edema and thrombosis, as well as lymphedema secondary to dissected lymph nodes.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of a uterine fibroid versus an adnexal tumor is made. Fibroids can be mistaken for ovarian neoplasms. An uncommon tumor which may {{be mistaken for a}} fibroid is Sarcoma botryoides. It is more common in children and adolescents. Like a fibroid, it can also protrude from the vagina and is distinguished from fibroids. While palpation used in a pelvic examination can typically identify the {{presence of}} larger fibroids, <b>gynecologic</b> ultrasonography (ultrasound) has evolved as the standard tool to evaluate the uterus for fibroids. Sonography will depict the fibroids as focal masses with a heterogeneous texture, which usually cause shadowing of the ultrasound beam. The location can be determined and dimensions of the lesion measured. Also, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to define the depiction of the size and location of the fibroids within the uterus.|$|E
500|$|In the United States, {{endometrial cancer}} is the most {{frequently}} diagnosed <b>gynecologic</b> cancer and, in women, the fourth most common cancer overall, representing 6% of all cancer cases in women. In that country, [...] {{it was estimated that}} 52,630women were diagnosed yearly and 8,590 would die from the disease. Northern Europe, Eastern Europe, and North America have the highest rates of endometrial cancer, whereas Africa and West Asia have the lowest rates. Asia saw 41% of the world's endometrial cancer diagnoses in 2012, whereas Northern Europe, Eastern Europe, and North America together comprised 48% of diagnoses. Unlike most cancers, the number of new cases has risen in recent years, including an increase of over 40% in the United Kingdom between 1993 and 2013. Some of this rise {{may be due to the}} increase in obesity rates in developed countries, increasing life expectancies, and lower birth rates. The average lifetime risk for endometrial cancer is approximately 2–3% in people with uteruses. In the UK, approximately 7,400cases are diagnosed annually, and in the EU, approximately 88,000.|$|E
2500|$|NET {{is used as}} a {{hormonal}} contraceptive in combination with an estrogen – usually ethinylestradiol (EE) – in combined oral contraceptive pills and alone in progestogen-only pills. NET has also been proven to be effective in inhibiting LH and FSH levels in men as well. Without these hormones, mature sperm cannot survive in the testes. This means that NET could also be an effective male {{hormonal contraceptive}}. Aside from its use as a contraceptive, NET can be used to treat premenstrual syndrome, dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, irregular menstruation, menopausal symptoms (in combination with estrogen), or to postpone a period. It is also commonly used to help prevent uterine hemorrhage in complicated non-surgical or pre-surgical <b>gynecologic</b> cases and in treating non responsive cyclical mastalgia.|$|E
2500|$|Secondary {{lymphedema}} affects {{both men}} and women. In women, it is most prevalent in the upper limbs after breast cancer surgery, in particular after axillary lymph node dissection, occurring in the arm {{on the side of}} the body in which the surgery is performed. Breast and trunk lymphedema can also occur but, go unrecognised as there is swelling in the area after surgery and its symptoms ( [...] peau d' orange and/or an inverted nipple [...] ) can be confused with post surgery fat necrosis. In Western countries, secondary lymphedema is most commonly due to cancer treatment. Between 38 and 89% of breast cancer patients suffer from lymphedema due to axillary lymph node dissection and/or radiation. Unilateral lymphedema occurs in up to 41% of patients after <b>gynecologic</b> cancer. For men, a 5-66% incidence of lymphedema has been reported in patients treated with incidence depending on whether staging or radical removal of lymph glands was done in addition to radiotherapy.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Gynecologic</b> ultrasonography, {{specifically}} {{looking for}} small ovarian follicles. These {{are believed to}} be the result of disturbed ovarian function with failed ovulation, reflected by the infrequent or absent menstruation that is typical of the condition. In a normal menstrual cycle, one egg is released from a dominant follicle– in essence, a cyst that bursts to release the egg. After ovulation, the follicle remnant is transformed into a progesterone-producing corpus luteum, which shrinks and disappears after approximately 12–14 days. In PCOS, there is a so-called [...] "follicular arrest"; i.e., several follicles develop to a size of 5–7mm, but not further. No single follicle reaches the preovulatory size (16mm or more). According to the Rotterdam criteria, which are widely used for diagnosis, 12 or more small follicles should be seen in an ovary on ultrasound examination. More recent research suggests that there should be at least 25 follicles in an ovary to designate it as having polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) in women aged 18–35 years. The follicles may be oriented in the periphery, giving the appearance of a 'string of pearls'. If a high resolution transvaginal ultrasonography machine is not available, an ovarian volume of at least 10 ml is regarded as an acceptable definition of having polycystic ovarian morphology instead of follicle count.|$|E
2500|$|Communication is {{critical}} for the delivery of appropriate and effective treatment and care, regardless of a patient’s race, and miscommunication can lead to incorrect diagnosis, improper use of medications, and failure to receive follow-up care. [...] The patient provider relationship {{is dependent on the}} ability of both individuals to effectively communicate. [...] Language and culture both {{play a significant role in}} communication during a medical visit. Among the patient population, minorities face greater difficulty in communicating with their physicians. [...] Patients when surveyed responded that 19% of the time they have problems communicating with their providers which included understanding doctor, feeling doctor listened, and had questions but did not ask. In contrast, the Hispanic population had the largest problem communicating with their provider, 33% of the time. Communication has been linked to health outcomes, as communication improves so does patient satisfaction which leads to improved compliance and then to improved health outcomes. Quality of care is impacted as a result of an inability to communicate with health care providers. [...] Language plays a pivotal role in communication and efforts need to be taken to ensure excellent communication between patient and provider. Among limited English proficient patients in the United States, the linguistic barrier is even greater. [...] Less than half of non-English speakers who say they need an interpreter during clinical visits report having one. [...] The absence of interpreters during a clinical visit adds to the communication barrier. Furthermore, inability of providers to communicate with limited English proficient patients leads to more diagnostic procedures, more invasive procedures, and over prescribing of medications. Poor communication contributes to poor medical compliance and health outcomes. [...] Many health-related settings provide interpreter services for their limited English proficient patients. This has been helpful when providers do not speak the same language as the patient. [...] However, there is mounting evidence that patients need to communicate with a language concordant physician (not simply an interpreter) to receive the best medical care, bond with the physician, and be satisfied with the care experience. Having patient-physician language discordant pairs (i.e. Spanish-speaking patient with an English-speaking physician) may also lead to greater medical expenditures and thus higher costs to the organization. [...] Additional communication problems result from a decrease or lack of cultural competence by providers. [...] It is important for providers to be cognizant of patients’ health beliefs and practices without being judgmental or reacting. [...] Understanding a patients’ view of health and disease is important for diagnosis and treatment. [...] So providers need to assess patients’ health beliefs and practices to improve quality of care. Patient health decisions can be influenced by religious beliefs, mistrust of Western medicine, and familial and hierarchical roles, all of which a white provider may not be familiar with. Other type of communication problems are seen in LGBT health care with the spoken heterosexist (conscious or unconscious) attitude on LGBT patients, lack of understanding on issues like having no sex with men (lesbians, <b>gynecologic</b> examinations) and other issues.|$|E
