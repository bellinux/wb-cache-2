40|$|Aalto University		Abstract School of Business		June 19, 2013 Department of Finance		 Master's Thesis		 Riku Ahvenainen		Number {{of pages}} 76 TRADE LEVEL DELIVERY FAILURES: NEW EVIDENCE FROM THE FINNISH MARKET PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The {{purpose of this}} study is to examine {{delivery}} failures at trade level and determine which factors affect the likelihood of delivery failures. In the existing literature cost of borrowing stock is found to have relation to delivery failures but these studies are conducted by using aggregated data and are done in the U. S context. This study applies trade level data from the Finnish market, providing new evidence on delivery failures. This study also illustrates for the reader how the post-trade processes work and what are the differences between markets. DATA: This thesis applies trade level data of a remote broker operating in the Finnish market. All OTC trades settled during a six month period from January to June 2012 are included in the original sample. The analyzed sample consists of 4153 deliveries, of which 242 deliveries are failures. In addition, stock specific variables are determined for each trade in order to proxy the cost of borrowing. Market capitalization, turnover, cash flow and price-to-book data are from Thomson One Banker database, institutional ownership data are from Orbis database and <b>Internet</b> message <b>board</b> <b>activity</b> is collected from Kauppalehti's Internet message board. RESULTS: The results show that delivery failures are mostly short-term in the Finnish market, lasting one to three days. The results give support for the hypotheses that when stock loan supply increases, the likelihood of delivery failures decreases, and when the stock loan demand increases due to differences of opinion among investors, the likelihood increases. Increase in market capitalization decreases the likelihood of delivery failures, having marginal effect up to - 11. 35 %. Turnover, price-to-book and <b>Internet</b> message <b>board</b> <b>activity</b> increase the likelihood of short-term delivery failures...|$|R

The {{purpose of the present}} study was to investigate leisure <b>activities,</b> particularly <b>Internet</b> <b>activities,</b> among boys and girls with ADHD, and compare these with boys and girls from the general population. The objective was also to explore how traditional leisure <b>activities</b> and <b>Internet</b> <b>activities</b> interrelate among adolescents with ADHD. Method: Adolescents with ADHD (n = 102) were compared with adolescents from the general population on leisure <b>activities</b> and <b>Internet</b> use. Results: Leisure activities among adolescents with ADHD tended to focus on <b>Internet</b> <b>activities,</b> particularly online games. <b>Internet</b> <b>activities</b> were broadening leisure activities among adolescents with ADHD, rather than being a substitute for traditional leisure <b>activities.</b> Conclusion: <b>Internet</b> <b>activities</b> may provide adolescents with ADHD accessible means of social interaction...|$|R

However, the Internet Society itself {{grew out of}} the IETF, to support those functions that require a corporate form rather than simply the ad hoc approach of the IETF. In reality, the Internet Society was formed because the IETF Secretariat, which had been operated under NSF contract by staff at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) would not be supported beyond 1991 by NSF. The then <b>Internet</b> <b>Activities</b> <b>Board</b> sought to create a non-profit institution that could provide financial support for the IETF Secretariat among other things.

40|$|Abstract — Forensic Investigation into {{security}} incidents often includes {{the examination of}} huge lists of <b>internet</b> <b>activity</b> gathered from a suspect computer. In today’s age of increased internet usage, the <b>internet</b> <b>activity</b> log on any given system could produce a huge list of websites. This, couples {{with the fact that}} a huge percentage of malware is now distributed via the internet, often through compromised websites, means that valuable clues regarding the source and identity of malware infections are often hidden within the <b>internet</b> <b>activity</b> logs on a computer. While a multitude of tools exist to extract <b>internet</b> <b>activity</b> data from a host computer, most do not filter this activity data. As a result, an investigator could be faced with thousands of website URL’s to sift through for clues regarding malware infection. In this paper, we discuss some of the ways that computers are infected, and why <b>internet</b> <b>activity</b> data is an important resource that must be analyzed in a forensic investigation. We then present a tool that utilizes the Google Safe Browsing Lookup API, which is an extension of the broader Google Safe Browsing API, to do quick lookups on long lists of URL’s and significantly narrow the list to enable the investigator to conduct a more efficient investigation...|$|R
