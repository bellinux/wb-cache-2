40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Thinning {{of young}} Douglas-fir forests has the {{potential}} to enhance structural diversity and improve habitat for wildlife. I examined the effects of thinning and thinning intensity on abundance and demographic characteristics of forest-floor small mammals in the Coast Range of Oregon 5 and 6 years after thinning had occurred. <b>Thinning</b> resulted <b>in</b> greater densities of Townsend's chipmunks (Tamias townsendii), creeping voles (Microtus oregoni), and Pacific jumping mice (Zapus trinotatus), and densities of chipmunks and creeping voles were greater <b>in</b> heavily <b>thinned</b> stands than <b>in</b> moderately <b>thinned</b> stands. Movement of female chipmunks was less <b>in</b> heavily <b>thinned</b> stands and movement of female deer mice was less <b>in</b> <b>thinned</b> stands. Sex ratios of deer mice and creeping voles were skewed toward females <b>in</b> heavily <b>thinned</b> stands. Body mass of male deer mice was also greater <b>in</b> heavily <b>thinned</b> stands. Thinning had neutral effects on density of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and on populations of Trowbridge's shrews (Sorex trowbridgii), Baird's shrews (Sorex bairdi), Pacific shrews (Sorexpacjflcus), and shrew-moles (Neurotrichus gibbsii). Northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus) were more abundant in unthmnned stands than <b>in</b> <b>thinned</b> stands 5 years after thinning had occurred. Greater amounts of small-diameter down wood and slash, and increases in percent cover of low shrubs after thinning may partially explain the increases in abundance of chipmunks, Pacific jumping mice, and creeping voles <b>in</b> <b>thinned</b> stands. Thinning young Douglas-fir forests appears to enhance habitat quality for most species of forest-floor small mammals. <b>In</b> addition, heavy <b>thinning</b> may hasten development of mature forest conditions that may provide optimal habitat for these species. However, because some species appear to prefer closed canopy forests, it is recommended that some unthinned stands be retained as a component of the forested landscape...|$|R

5|$|Unlike earlier pterosaurs such as Rhamphorhynchus and Pterodactylus, Pteranodon had toothless beaks, {{similar to}} those of birds. Pteranodon beaks were made of solid, bony margins that {{projected}} {{from the base of the}} jaws. The beaks were long, slender, and ended <b>in</b> <b>thin,</b> sharp points. The upper jaw was longer than the lower jaw. The upper jaw was curved upward; while this normally has been attributed only to the upward-curving beak, one specimen (UALVP 24238) has a curvature corresponding with the beak widening towards the tip. While the tip of the beak is not known in this specimen, the level of curvature suggests it would have been extremely long. The unique form of the beak in this specimen led Alexander Kellner to assign it to a distinct genus, Dawndraco, in 2010.|$|E

In this context, it is notable that in trees in the unthinned plots experiencing the most severe competition there were strong “pulses” of growth following drought-breaking rainfall events. Unthinned plots at high stand densities also maintained a smaller (but consistent) zone of dividing cells throughout the season than thinned plots.|$|R
