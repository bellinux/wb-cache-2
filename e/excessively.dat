5|$|Deeknut (Corylus Dikana), {{grows in}} hot, <b>excessively</b> dry areas. An {{occasional}} garnish used in middle-eastern dishes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the third}} stage there are {{physical}} and social consequences, i.e., hangovers, family problems, work problems, etc. A person will continue to drink <b>excessively,</b> disregarding the problems.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{remains largely}} opposed {{at least in}} the short term to a {{collective}} takeover of the debt of states that have run excessive budget deficits and borrowed <b>excessively</b> over the past years.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} {{first-hand}} criticism from riders following the race that the route was <b>excessively</b> difficult and dangerous, Zomegnan remained staunch {{in his defense}} of the route.|$|E
5|$|The Beau Brummels {{had taken}} their name, a British term for a term for an <b>excessively</b> well-dressed person, {{suggested}} to them, which lead singer Valentino maintained they didn't {{even know how to}} spell.|$|E
5|$|Accounts by 19th-century historians {{suggest that}} Day grew {{impatient}} with the girls when they became bored with their lessons and began to squabble, and that he also spent significant time nursing them through a bout of smallpox. These accounts may have been exaggerated as both girls had been inoculated against smallpox, and their strict upbringing meant {{they would not have}} rebelled <b>excessively.</b>|$|E
5|$|After his death, Gaudí's works {{suffered}} {{a period of}} neglect and were largely unpopular among international critics, who regarded them as baroque and <b>excessively</b> imaginative. In his homeland he was equally disdained by Noucentisme, the new movement which took the place of Modernisme. In 1936, during the Spanish Civil War, Gaudí's workshop in the Sagrada Família was ransacked, and {{a great number of}} his documents, plans and scale models were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they were}} not penalized, Nuggets coach George Karl and Knicks coach Isiah Thomas were both {{scrutinized}} for their part in the brawl. Carmelo Anthony was also criticized for harming his image as a star, and several writers said the league had penalized the players <b>excessively</b> because it wanted to keep its image free from violence.|$|E
5|$|Deck {{decompression}} chambers {{are used}} for surface decompression, described in a previous section. Most deck decompression chambers are fitted with built in breathing systems (BIBS), which supply an alternative breathing gas to the occupants (usually oxygen), and discharge the exhaled gas outside the chamber, so the chamber gas is not <b>excessively</b> enriched by oxygen, which would cause an unacceptable fire hazard, and require frequent flushing with chamber gas (usually air).|$|E
5|$|Devadasu is {{surprised}} at her visit, sends her away, {{and goes back}} to the city. He writes to Parvati that he cannot defy his parents, so Parvati marries the old zamindar. Unable to forget her, Devadasu is despondent. He takes to drinking alcohol <b>excessively</b> and is encouraged by his friend Bhagawan, who also introduces him to Chandramukhi, a prostitute.|$|E
5|$|Eckfeldt also {{produced}} a pattern disme, of which {{only a few}} were struck. When the Mint's first cents (produced in 1793) {{were found to be}} <b>excessively</b> crude and attracted public ridicule, Eckfeldt was called upon to design replacements. He placed a wreath {{on the back of the}} cent instead of the original chain, and placed a trefoil under Liberty's head on the obverse. He also engraved the first half cent dies later the same year.|$|E
5|$|Identified {{risk factors}} for plantar {{fasciitis}} include excessive running, standing on hard surfaces for prolonged periods of time, high arches of the feet, {{the presence of a}} leg length inequality, and flat feet. The tendency of flat feet to <b>excessively</b> roll inward during walking or running makes them more susceptible to plantar fasciitis. Obesity is seen in 70% of individuals who present with plantar fasciitis and is an independent risk factor.|$|E
5|$|Innovation {{policies}} have been <b>excessively</b> focused on the supply of technologies, neglecting the demand side (the user). There have been several initiatives by the European Commission to support and research design and design management in recent years. However, a European-wide policy to support design has never been planned, due to the inconsistencies and differences in design policies in each nation. Nonetheless, there are currently plans to include design in the EU innovation policy.|$|E
5|$|KCMG's No 47 car had its {{qualifying}} lap times disallowed {{after it}} was discovered in post-qualifying scrutineering that the vehicle's skid block had insufficient rigidity and had been <b>excessively</b> flexible. The penalty meant Team SARD Morand's No. 43 car was promoted to second in LMP2 and the No. 47 entry was required to start from the pit lane with a 30-second time penalty.|$|E
5|$|Other {{criticism}} {{focuses on}} IFC working <b>excessively</b> with large companies or wealthy individuals already able {{to finance their}} investments without help from public institutions such as IFC, and such investments {{do not have an}} adequate positive development impact. An example often cited by NGOs and critical journalists is IFC granting financing to a Saudi prince for a five-star hotel in Ghana.|$|E
5|$|Spending {{reductions}} {{included a}} reduction in Medicare reimbursements to insurers and drug companies for private Medicare Advantage policies that the Government Accountability Office and Medicare Payment Advisory Commission found to be <b>excessively</b> costly relative to government Medicare; and reductions in Medicare reimbursements to hospitals that failed standards of efficiency and care.|$|E
5|$|Systemic {{institutional}} {{problems in the}} delivery of pain management include lack of resources for adequate training of physicians, time constraints, failure to refer people for pain management in the clinical setting, inadequate insurance reimbursement for pain management, lack of sufficient stocks of pain medicines in poorer areas, outdated government policies on cancer pain management, and <b>excessively</b> complex or restrictive government and institutional regulations on the prescription, supply, and administration of opioid medications.|$|E
5|$|The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) is an American self-regulatory {{organization}} that assigns age and content ratings to consumer video games. The ESRB {{was established in}} 1994 by the Entertainment Software Association (formerly the Interactive Digital Software Association), in response to criticism of controversial video games with <b>excessively</b> violent or sexual content.|$|E
5|$|The band entered Music Box Studios in Los Angeles with Gordon and Fleming in March 1991, {{and worked}} on the album for one week; the songs were {{recorded}} {{over a period of}} four days, and were mixed {{over the course of a}} further three days. During the recording sessions for the album, Love purportedly gargled whiskey and <b>excessively</b> smoked cigarettes before takes to give a raw edge to her vocals.|$|E
5|$|A mutant {{criminal}} {{recruited by}} the Brotherhood in a prison truck, Juggernaut is incredibly strong, fast and, once he gains momentum, he is nearly unstoppable. The film's version of Juggernaut is depicted as a mutant and his relation to Charles Xavier was never mentioned. Matthew Vaughn cast Jones, who he met producing the Guy Ritchie gangster movies where Jones begun his acting career. The actor {{had to go through}} a four-hour make-up process to portray Juggernaut, which included a muscle suit and a prostethic chin. The costume tried to retain the bullet-shaped helmet of the comics without going <b>excessively</b> over the top.|$|E
5|$|According to series artist Keiji Inafune, Dr. Wily's Revenge was {{the first}} Mega Man game to be {{outsourced}} to a developer separate from Capcom. Critical reception for the game has been favorable, and most sources have denoted it as a competent, if <b>excessively</b> difficult, portable version of the popular NES series. Dr. Wily's Revenge was a best-seller and spawned four sequels of its own on the Game Boy, many of which follow its trend of reusing elements from their home console counterparts. In 2011, Dr. Wily's Revenge was made available as a Virtual Console launch title on Japan's Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo 3DS. It also appeared on PAL region and North American eShops later that year.|$|E
5|$|Advocates {{for higher}} levels of {{selection}} (such as Richard Lewontin, David Sloan Wilson, and Elliott Sober) {{suggest that there are}} many phenomena (including altruism) that gene-based selection cannot satisfactorily explain. The philosopher Mary Midgley, with whom Dawkins clashed in print concerning The Selfish Gene, has criticised gene selection, memetics, and sociobiology as being <b>excessively</b> reductionist; she has suggested that the popularity of Dawkins's work is due to factors in the Zeitgeist such as the increased individualism of the Thatcher/Reagan decades.|$|E
5|$|After {{some initial}} resistance, the Duke yields to Süß's {{request for the}} repeal of the law prohibiting Jews from living in Württemberg; a horde of dirty, disreputable Jews are then shown moving into the city. Süß enables them to enrich {{themselves}} {{at the expense of the}} populace. The aged Rabbi Loew (Werner Krauss) criticizes Süß for his <b>excessively</b> opulent lifestyle as the Duke's finance minister and warns that it could be his downfall, warning that, “The Lord punishes Jews who forget who they are!” but Süß pays him no heed.|$|E
5|$|Arboreal frogs have pads {{located on}} the ends of their toes to help grip {{vertical}} surfaces. These are not suction pads, the surface consisting instead of columnar cells with flat tops with small gaps between them lubricated by mucous glands. When the frog applies pressure, the cells adhere to irregularities on the surface and the grip is maintained through surface tension. This allows the frog to climb on smooth surfaces, but the system does not function efficiently when the pads are <b>excessively</b> wet.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{were now}} made {{to find a}} role for the {{remaining}} 19 locomotives. By now many had been relegated to hauling trains in what were once seen as remote outposts of the LMS. Often they were reduced to pulling stopping trains, empty stock trains, or even goods trains. Only one realistic mainline role was contemplated: to replace the Scottish Region A4 Class on the testing route between Edinburgh Waverley and Aberdeen. This idea was discarded largely {{because it would be}} <b>excessively</b> problematic to train the A4 crews to operate the Coronations. With no credible role, only one option remained: in July 1964 it was resolved that the remaining 19 locomotives were to be withdrawn from 12 September.|$|E
5|$|Endometrial cancer forms {{when there}} are errors in normal endometrial cell growth. Usually, when cells grow old or get damaged, they die, and new cells take their place. Cancer starts when new cells form unneeded, and old or damaged cells do not die as they should. The buildup of extra cells often forms a mass of tissue called a growth or tumor. These {{abnormal}} cancer cells have many genetic abnormalities that cause them to grow <b>excessively.</b>|$|E
5|$|From 1995-1997, {{the firm}} created seven new subsidiaries. These {{included}} Guthy-Renker Radio, Internet, Select Network, International and Fitness, {{as well as}} subsidiaries like an online dating service and a psychic business that did not perform well. Guthy-Renker partnered with National Media Corp. to help market some of its fitness products, {{which led to a}} legal dispute that was settled with undisclosed terms in 1997. Guthy-Renker claimed National Media Corp. <b>excessively</b> aired infomercials for an exercise machine, the Fitness Flyer, and started selling an unauthorized imitation of the original. National claimed Guthy-Renker had not provided enough Fitness Flyers to meet demand.|$|E
5|$|From March 2013, {{concerns}} over further currency war diminished, though in November several journalists and analysts warned {{of a possible}} fresh outbreak. The likely principal source of tension appeared to shift once again, this time not being the U.S. versus China or the Eurozone versus Japan, but the U.S. versus Germany. In late October U.S. treasury officials had criticized Germany for running an <b>excessively</b> large current account surplus, thus acting as a drag on the global economy.|$|E
5|$|From {{this model}} of Kantian ethics, O'Neill begins to develop a theory of justice. She argues that the {{rejection}} of certain principles, such as deception and coercion, provides {{a starting point for}} basic conceptions of justice, which she argues are more determinate for human beings that the more abstract principles of equality or liberty. Nevertheless, she concedes that these principles may seem to be <b>excessively</b> demanding: there are many actions and institutions that do rely on non-universalisable principles, such as injury.|$|E
5|$|In {{designing}} the 777 {{as its first}} fly-by-wire commercial aircraft, Boeing decided to retain conventional control yokes rather than change to sidestick controllers as used in many fly-by-wire fighter aircraft and in many Airbus airliners. Along with traditional yoke and rudder controls, the cockpit features a simplified layout that retains similarities to previous Boeing models. The fly-by-wire system also incorporates flight envelope protection, a system that guides pilot inputs within a computer-calculated framework of operating parameters, acting to prevent stalls, overspeeds, and <b>excessively</b> stressful maneuvers. This system can be overridden by the pilot if deemed necessary. The fly-by-wire system is supplemented by mechanical backup.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century Æthelwulf's {{reputation}} among historians was poor: he {{was seen}} as <b>excessively</b> pious and impractical, and his pilgrimage {{was viewed as a}} desertion of his duties. Historians in the 21st century see him very differently, as a king who consolidated and extended the power of his dynasty, commanded respect on the continent, and dealt more effectively than most of his contemporaries with Viking attacks. He is {{regarded as one of the}} most successful West Saxon kings, who laid the foundations for the success of his son, Alfred the Great.|$|E
5|$|Marochetti {{accepted}} {{the commission and}} created plaster models of the reliefs. He installed one of the models in his château in France, where it remains today, while the other was set into {{the wall of a}} gardener's cottage adjoining his French estate. The bronze relief of the deathbed scene was added to the pedestal in August 1866, while the Taking of Ascalon was installed in March 1867. The Art Journal criticised the deathbed scene as being <b>excessively</b> stretched lengthways and noted similarities with a painting displayed in the Houses of Parliament, created by John Cross, that depicted the same subject.|$|E
5|$|Morales {{has been}} praised for {{significantly}} reducing poverty and illiteracy in Bolivia {{and has been}} internationally decorated with various awards. His supporters have lauded him {{as a champion of}} indigenous rights, anti-imperialism, and environmentalism. Alternately, a number of leftist, indigenous, and environmentalist critics have accused him of failing to live up to many of his espoused values, while right-wing opponents have accused him of being <b>excessively</b> radical and authoritarian and claimed that his defence of coca contributes to illegal cocaine production.|$|E
5|$|Nathu La has {{moderately}} shallow, <b>excessively</b> drained, coarse, and {{loamy soil}} {{on a steep}} slope (30–50%) with gravelly loamy surface, moderate erosion, and moderate stoniness. It has several sinking zones and parts of it are prone to landslides. To preserve the fragile environment of Nathu La on the Indian side, the government of India regulates the flow of tourists. Road maintenance is entrusted to Border Roads Organisation, a wing of the Indian Army. On the Chinese side the pass leads to the Chumbi Valley of the Tibetan Plateau.|$|E
5|$|On February 17, 1859, the French {{warships}} {{opened fire}} on the citadel with artillery. This attack focused on the southeastern corner of the citadel, {{where most of the}} Vietnamese artillery had been installed. The Vietnamese artillery commanders had miscalculated and had set up their cannons incorrectly, firing at <b>excessively</b> high angles. The cannons were not easily adjusted and thus the Vietnamese firepower was misdirected and ineffective. At around 10:00, Captain Des Pallieres led 300 French soldiers in an infantry attack. They used bamboo ladders to scale the walls under artillery support from the river. The defenders were caught off guard by this manoevre and many fled in chaos.|$|E
