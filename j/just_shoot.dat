Prior to the channel's launch TV3 signed agreements with big US broadcasters to air first rights of Sex and the City, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, JAG, , The Net, South Park and <b>Just</b> <b>Shoot</b> Me!. TV3 has also relied on imports from the UK and Australia. In its early days the channel aired two popular UK dramas, Family Affairs (broadcast 18 months after Channel 5) and EastEnders (broadcast with advertising simultaneously with BBC One), and also the short-lived Australian soap Breakers and the US soap Sunset Beach.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of the 2000s, NBC's {{fortunes}} started to take a rapid turn for the worse. That year, NBC's longstanding ratings lead ended as CBS (which had languished in the ratings after losing the NFL) overtook it for first place. In 2001, CBS chose to move its hit reality series Survivor to serve as the anchor of its Thursday night lineup. Its success was taken as a suggestion that NBC's nearly two decades of dominance on Thursday nights could be broken; even so, the strength of Friends, Will & Grace, ER and <b>Just</b> <b>Shoot</b> Me! (the latter of which saw its highest viewership following its move to that night in the 2000–01 season) helped the network continue to lead the Thursday ratings. Overall, NBC retook its first place lead that year, and spent much of the next four years (with the exception of the 2002–03 season, when it was briefly jumped again by CBS for first) in the top spot.|$|E

500|$|In {{her first}} appearance, Laura San Giacomo plays Harmony Chase, {{a woman who}} hires Keith to {{investigate}} her cheating husband. The two were both series regulars on the NBC sitcom <b>Just</b> <b>Shoot</b> Me!. The two actors had maintained a close friendship after their sitcom was cancelled, and when Rob Thomas brought up a romantic storyline for Keith to Colantoni, he suggested Giacomo for the role. Giacomo accepted the role, later stating, [...] "It {{was kind of a}} no-brainer situation for me. I love Rico, love working with him, and it was just as much fun as I thought it would be." [...] In addition to sharing in-jokes about <b>Just</b> <b>Shoot</b> Me! while on set, Colantoni also remembered what a good actress he thought she was in their earlier days. After the first appearance, both Colantoni and Giacomo lobbied for more storylines together. Thomas was open to the possibility, saying, [...] "I wouldn't hesitate to go back to this, because I was really happy with how it played out." [...] Giacomo would go on to appear on three episodes of the show.|$|E

That's usually more interesting I think." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{regards to}} her gun use, Madea <b>just</b> <b>shoots</b> around targets, using {{intimidation}} {{as opposed to}} ever actually killing or injuring anyone. As another form of intimidation, Madea frequently boasts of having killed in the past. As an example, she once claimed to have murdered Jimmy Hoffa over him insulting her. She also claimed to have shot Tupac Shakur while arguing over a parking space; although she claims not to have killed him in the shooting.|$|R
500|$|... "Charlie Don't Surf" [...] {{featured}} several notable guest stars, including Matt Czuchry, Ryan Eggold, and San Giacomo, {{who plays}} Harmony Chase, a romantic interest for Keith. Actor Enrico Colantoni, who plays Keith, wanted San Giacomo {{to play the}} role of Harmony because of the actors' ongoing friendship since their show <b>Just</b> <b>Shoot</b> Me! Both actors enjoyed the guest appearance so much that they lobbied the show's production team to continue the characters' romantic storyline in the future. The episode received mostly positive reviews from television critics.|$|E
500|$|The film's violent climax was edited {{together}} {{in its present}} shape due to a continuity problem. In the screenplay, the soldier played by Nicky Henson was supposed to shoot both Price and Ogilvy to death. However, the actor only had one flintlock pistol, which had been clearly established in previous scenes, and was therefore only able to shoot one person. When the error was discovered, Reeves immediately told the actor: [...] "All right, <b>just</b> <b>shoot</b> Vincent and I'll get Ian to scream and shout and go mad and freeze frame on Hilary Dwyer screaming." ...|$|E

They rekindled their friendship during production of [...] "Charlie Don't Surf", San Giacomo's first appearance, so they lobbied for more storylines together.

In the early 1990s, he recounted: [...] "I had the best seat in the house to watch that event, and our destroyers were <b>just</b> <b>shooting</b> at phantom targets—there were no PT boats there....

500|$|We {{really wanted}} to spend time, immerse ourselves, drive {{for hours and hours}} aimlessly with a camera, jumping out and {{shooting}} things that caught my eye. We didn't want to go there and <b>just</b> <b>shoot</b> Frenchy's Chicken and call it an [...] "authentic video." [...] There was tons of hanging out, getting the feel, all with cameras ready. We hooked up with our dude Scotty who was a great help, plus Bun B's brother Truck, and Paul Wall. The city was so receptive, so willing to help, so open, and that leant a lot {{to the fact that we}} really got to glimpse of the real character of Houston.|$|E
500|$|When {{the look}} of the film was being decided, Mark Steven Johnson opted to use direct scenes from the Daredevil comics.

You <b>just</b> <b>shoot</b> that." [...] Throughout the film, Ben Affleck had to wear [...] "cataract milky-blue" [...] contacts, which would effectively make him blind.

Although he says that {{portions}} of the earlier days were circulating among the literate citizens of Tuscany while the work was in progress, this is doubtful. Instead, Boccaccio is probably <b>just</b> <b>shooting</b> down potential detractors. The reader must remember that vernacular fictional prose was not a respected genre in 14th century Italy {{and some of the}} criticisms Boccaccio combats in the introduction to the fourth day were common attitudes towards the genre.

500|$|According to Roth, [...] "My friend Jeff, {{who plays}} the killer pilgrim – {{we grew up in}} Massachusetts, we were huge slasher movie fans and every November we were waiting for the Thanksgiving slasher movie. We had the whole movie worked out: A kid who's in love with a turkey, and then his father killed it, and then he killed his family and went away to a mental {{institution}} and came back and took revenge on the town. I called Jeff and said, 'Dude, guess what, we don't have to make the movie, we can <b>just</b> <b>shoot</b> the best parts.'"

500|$|Ross was {{impressed}} with the in-camera effects achieved for the series, but he would always propose visual effect alternatives to these on set because [...] "you have to embrace what VFX can do for you. The cost of spending half a day on a special scene has got to be worth it, or else you can <b>just</b> <b>shoot</b> a plate and do the rest in post and save yourself all that production time". Ross photographed all the series' sets as reference footage to work from in case a visual effect shot was ultimately required, explaining, [...] "Sometimes while looking at the assembly I’ll realize we need another shot but there isn’t any coverage that works. [...] us a starting point for building our new shots. And whether they are all-CG or just elements, we are always dealing with Noah’s aesthetic of making it look as real as possible." ...|$|E
500|$|The fight {{scenes in}} the town were filmed in Kairouan, while Ford was {{suffering}} from dysentery. Stuntman Terry Richards had practiced for weeks with his sword to create the scripted fight scene, choreographing a fight between the swordsman and Jones' whip. However, after filming the initial shots of the scene, after lunch due to Ford's dysentery, Ford and Spielberg agreed to cut the scene down to a gunshot, with Ford saying to Spielberg [...] "Let's <b>just</b> <b>shoot</b> the sucker". It was later voted in at No.5 on Playboy magazine's list of best all time scenes. Most of the truck chase was shot by second unit director Michael D. Moore following Spielberg's storyboards, including Indiana being dragged by the truck (performed by stuntman Terry Leonard), in tribute to a famous Yakima Canutt stunt. Spielberg then filmed all the shots with Ford himself {{in and around the}} truck cab. Lucas directed a few other second unit shots, in particular the monkey giving the Nazi salute.|$|E
5000|$|Critical in the {{planning}} {{was the idea of}} plausible deniability, that it should be impossible to prove a direct connection between the assassinations and Israel. In addition, the operations were more generally intended to terrorize Palestinian militants. According to David Kimche, former deputy head of Mossad, [...] "The aim was not so much revenge but mainly to make them Palestinian terrorists frightened. We wanted to make them look over their shoulders and feel that we are upon them. And therefore we tried not to do things by <b>just</b> <b>shooting</b> a guy in the street - that's easy...fairly." ...|$|R

500|$|In {{addition}} to Bale breaking {{his hand and}} Worthington hurting his back, special effects technician Mike Menardis almost lost his leg filming an explosion. The sequence required a manhole cover being blown into the air, which hit Menardis and partially severed his leg. McG noted it was {{a testament to the}} gritty style of the film. [...] "I say with respect, I didn't want that Star Wars experience of everything's a blue screen, tennis balls, and go for it. I had Stan Winston build all the machines. We built all the sets, the explosive power, the explosive power so you feel that wind and that percussion and that heat blowing your eyebrows off. And with that, you get a couple bumps and bruises on the way, but you get it in an integrity and a realism that hopefully echoes Apocalypse Now. You couldn't say, 'Let's <b>just</b> <b>shoot</b> Apocalypse Now in Burbank, I think it's going to feel just as good.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{decision}} to expand its programming to Thursday and Friday nights, UPN picked up six original series. Mercy Point {{was one of two}} science fiction television shows picked up by UPN – [...] the second being the time travel-themed Seven Days. Scott D. Pierce of Deseret News described the network's choice of two science-fiction dramas and two 19th century programs (The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer and Legacy) as showing [...] "a definite bent toward the unusual". Prior to its premiere, the show was promoted through its inclusion of Joe Morton in a starring role. Although Callaway envisioned Mercy Point as a companion to Star Trek: Voyager, UPN paired the Star Trek installment with Seven Days instead. Mercy Point was initially broadcast on Tuesday nights at 9pmEST, following the sitcoms Moesha and Clueless. The Moesha and Clueless block was held over from the previous year. Entertainment Weeklys Dan Snierson noted that Mercy Point faced tough competition from other shows in the same time slot, primarily <b>Just</b> <b>Shoot</b> Me!, Spin City, and Felicity. The series carried a TV-PGparental rating, meaning that it was judged as [...] "unsuitable for young children".|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{title is}} a {{reference}} to the movie Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken. The movie The Bloodening is a parody of the 1960 film Village of the Damned.

The review Marge reads of Talk to the Hand [...] "The writing snaps, crackles and pops" [...] was how Variety reviewed the sitcom <b>Just</b> <b>Shoot</b> Me! when it first aired in 1997.
