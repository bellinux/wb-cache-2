5|$|China's power {{began to}} decline in the 16th century when the rulers of the {{subsequent}} Ming Dynastyneglected the importance of China's trade from sea power. The Ming rulers let China's naval dominance and <b>its</b> <b>grip</b> on the Spice trade slacken, and the European powers stepped in. Portugal, with its technological advances in naval architecture, weaponry, seamanship and navigation, took over the Spice Trade and subdued China's navy. With this, European Imperialism {{and the age of}} European Hegemony was beginning, although China still retained power of many of its areas of trade.|$|E
5|$|Relations {{between the}} two powers {{remained}} relatively quiet until {{the early years of}} the 8th century, by which time the stage for a new round of conflict was set: by this time, Byzantine political authority had been marginalized in the Caucasus, and the Caliphate tightened <b>its</b> <b>grip</b> on Armenia after the suppression of a large-scale rebellion in 705. With Armenia annexed into the Caliphate, the Arabs and the Khazars faced each other for control of the Caucasus. Only the western parts of Transcaucasia, comprising modern Georgia, remained free from direct control by either of the two rival powers. War broke out in 713/714, when the Umayyad general Maslama, a son of the Caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705), conquered Derbent. Maslama then drove deeper into Khazar territory, trying, without success, to subdue the Huns living north of the Caucasus (who were Khazar vassals). The Khazars opposed him under the general Alp', but also launched raids to the south into Albania in response. In 717, the Khazars raided in force into Adharbayjan, but they were driven back by the Arabs under Hatin ibn al-Nu'man.|$|E
5|$|Robert van Voren {{noted that}} {{after the fall of}} the Berlin Wall, it became {{apparent}} that the political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR was only the tip of the iceberg, the sign that much more was basically wrong. This much more realistic image of Soviet psychiatry showed up only after the Soviet regime began to loosen <b>its</b> <b>grip</b> on society and later lost control over the developments and in the end entirely disintegrated. It demonstrated that the actual situation was much sorer and that many individuals had been affected. Millions of individuals were treated and stigmatized by an outdated biologically oriented and hospital-based mental health service. Living conditions in clinics were bad, sometimes even terrible, and violations of human rights were rampant. According to the data of a census published in 1992, the mortality of the ill with schizophrenia exceeded that of the general population by 4–6 times for the age of 20–39 years, by 3–4 times for the age of 30–39 years, by 1.5–2 times for the age over 40 years (larger values are for women).|$|E

25|$|With the victory, Tampa Bay {{maintained}} <b>its</b> <b>grip</b> {{on first}} place in the NFC South with three weeks remaining. By game's end, the Bucs had a 1.5-game lead on both Atlanta and New Orleans, though the Saints’ late-afternoon game would either expand Tampa Bay's edge to two games or shrink it to one. The Bucs also became the first NFL team to 10 wins, at 10–3, as the 9–3 Philadelphia Eagles and Green Bay Packers were also scheduled for later games.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{first set}} its sights on {{moving from a}} resource-based economy to one based on knowledge in its 20-year development plan, Vision 2025, adopted in 2005. This transition became a priority after international sanctions were progressively hardened from 2006 onwards and the oil embargo tightened <b>its</b> <b>grip.</b> In February 2014, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei introduced {{what he called the}} ‘economy of resistance’, an economic plan advocating innovation and a lesser dependence on imports that reasserted key provisions of Vision 2025.|$|E
25|$|Decomposition of Navarrese Carlism {{continued}} in the late 1940s, demonstrated by the Pamplona riots of 1945, pro-Juanist stance of El Pensamiento Navarro and different factions competing for local administrative posts. The new Junta Regional appointed by Fal in 1947 and headed by Mariano Lumbier failed to produce any change and Carlism lost <b>its</b> <b>grip</b> even on the Pamplona council. Among overall disarray and increasing calls for more active attitude of the claimant, in 1951 Don Javier appointed a new Junta Regional, with Joaquín Baleztena regaining the Navarrese presidency.|$|E

25|$|In 9 AD, the Han {{official}} Wang Mang usurped the Han throne {{and proclaimed}} a new Chinese dynasty, known as Xin. He regarded the Xiongnu as lowly vassals and relations rapidly deteriorated. During the winter 10 to 11 AD, Wang amassed 300,000 troops {{along the northern}} frontier, which forced the Xiongnu to back down from launching large-scale attacks. Although Han rule was restored in August 25 AD by Emperor Guangwu, <b>its</b> <b>grip</b> over the Tarim Basin had weakened.

25|$|After the March First Independence Movement {{swept the}} {{peninsula}} in 1919, Japan somewhat relaxed <b>its</b> <b>grip</b> on Korea, {{and this is}} reflected in the Ordinance (1922). It ceased the arbitrary control of governor-general over the coursework and the qualification of faculty members, and altered its stance on strict separation of religion from all education. It also recognized Yonhi as a professional school equal to its counterparts in Japan, and permitted the Christian programs and the Bible in its coursework. Nevertheless, Japanese literature became mandatory. Under Japanese intervention, Korean history was taught under the name Eastern History, and Korean language was taught whenever possible.|$|E
25|$|Hard wax: a {{traditionally}} paraffin wax-based substance with admixtures—for snow comprising crystals that are relatively intact and not substantially changed by packing or freeze-thaw. The admixtures, {{which include a}} dye, rubber, rosin, resin and colophony, adjust the hardness of the wax to tailor the effectiveness of <b>its</b> <b>grip</b> for specific, discrete temperature ranges (from approximately -25°F to +35°F); waxes are graded and color-coded according to these temperature ranges. Harder grip waxes are designed for colder snow temperatures, but grip poorly in warm temperatures. Conversely, softer waxes in cold temperatures create enough friction and melting that the melt layer may accumulate and promote frozen accretion of snow.|$|E
50|$|The novel {{became a}} huge success due to <b>its</b> <b>gripping</b> story line and set {{precedent}} for English translations of other subsequent novels in the same series.

25|$|Following the Russian Revolution, the Russian Empire {{was broken}} up. In {{different}} parts of the former empire, several nations, including Ukrainians, developed a renewed sense of national identity. In the chaotic post-revolutionary years the Ukrainian language gained some usage in government affairs. Initially, this trend continued under the Bolshevik government of the Soviet Union, which in a political struggle to retain <b>its</b> <b>grip</b> over the territory had to encourage the national movements of the former Russian Empire. While trying to ascertain and consolidate its power, the Bolshevik government was by far more concerned about many political oppositions connected to the pre-revolutionary order than about the national movements inside the former empire, where it could always find allies.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} decades of the 19th century, Alger's moral tone coarsened with the change in boys' tastes. Sensational thrills were wanted by the public. The Protestant work ethic had {{loosened}} <b>its</b> <b>grip</b> on America, and violence, murder, and other sensational themes entered Alger's works. Public librarians questioned whether his books should {{be made available to}} the young. They were briefly successful, but interest in Alger's novels was renewed in {{the first decades of the}} 20th century, and they sold in the thousands. By the time he died in 1899, Alger had published around a hundred volumes. He is buried in South Natick, Massachusetts. Since 1947, the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans has awarded scholarships and prizes to deserving individuals.|$|E
25|$|With a {{sensitive}} change of leadership approaching in 2012 and popular uprisings against authoritarian regimes occurring across the Middle East, the ruling Chinese Communist Party {{showed no signs}} of loosening <b>its</b> <b>grip</b> on power in 2011. Despite minor legal improvements regarding the death penalty and urban property confiscation, the government stalled or even reversed previous reforms related to the rule of law, while security forces resorted to extralegal forms of repression. Growing public frustration over corruption and injustice fueled tens of thousands of protests and several large outbursts of online criticism during the year. The party responded by committing more resources to internal security forces and intelligence agencies, engaging in the systematic enforced disappearance of dozens of human rights lawyers and bloggers, and enhancing controls over online social media.|$|E

25|$|Normally, {{there are}} {{only a small number of}} ants in any given area on the plant stem. There are about 40 workers per leaf, but {{generally}} only a few will be patrolling outside. Once an insect lands on the plant, the closest ant will immediately surface and grab on to a leg, antenna, wing, or some other appendage of the prey. This ant will pull the prey, which will try to escape by pulling in the opposite direction. However, the ant will rarely let go of <b>its</b> <b>grip.</b> The ant immobilizes the prey and, using an extreme feat of strength, will hold the much larger prey to the plant as more ants from around that area arrive. This ability to hold the prey is extremely important because the ants move and congregate fairly slowly.|$|E
25|$|The facehugger is a parasitoid; {{its only}} {{purpose is to}} make contact with the host's mouth for the {{implantation}} process, by gripping its legs around the victim's head and wrapping its tail around the host's neck. Upon making contact, the facehugger administers a cynose-based paralytic in order to render it unconscious and immobile. During a successful attachment, the facehugger will insert a proboscis down the host's throat, while simultaneously implanting an embryo. The host is kept alive, and the creature breathes for the host. Attempts to remove facehuggers generally prove fatal, as the parasitoid will respond by tightening its tail around the host's neck, and its acidic blood prevents it from being cut away. In addition, <b>its</b> <b>grip</b> on the host's head is strong enough to tear the host's face off if it is forcibly removed.|$|E
25|$|Glasnost had {{inadvertently}} {{released the}} long-suppressed national sentiments of all peoples within {{the borders of}} the multinational Soviet state. These nationalist movements were further strengthened by the rapid deterioration of the Soviet economy, whose ramshackle foundations were exposed with the removal of Communist discipline. Gorbachev's reforms had failed to improve the economy, with the old Soviet command structure completely breaking down. One by one, the constituent republics created their own economic systems and voted to subordinate Soviet laws to local laws. In 1990, the Communist Party was forced to surrender its seven-decade monopoly of political power when the Supreme Soviet rescinded the clause in the Soviet Constitution that guaranteed its sole authority to rule. Gorbachev's policies caused the Communist Party to lose <b>its</b> <b>grip</b> over the media. Details of the Soviet Union's past were quickly being declassified. This caused many to distrust the 'old system' and push for greater autonomy and independence.|$|E
