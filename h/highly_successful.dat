5|$|There is {{evidence}} of widows engaging in independent economic activity. They can be found keeping schools, brewing ale and trading. Some were <b>highly</b> <b>successful,</b> like Janet Flockhart, an Edinburgh wadwife or moneylender, who had been left a widow with seven children after her third husband's suicide, and who managed her business affairs so successfully that she had amassed a moveable estate of £22,000 by her death in the late sixteenth century. The deaths of the two husbands of Mary Erskine (1629–1708) left her with the resources to become a <b>highly</b> <b>successful</b> business woman and philanthropist, founding the Mary Erskine School and the Trades Maiden Hospital in Edinburgh. Lower down the social scale the rolls of poor relief indicate {{that large numbers of}} widows with children endured a marginal existence and were particularly vulnerable in times of economic hardship. This may in part explain the relatively high rates of remarriage suggested by the available sources. Many widows needed financial security and widowers often needed heirs or a mother for their children. Although contemporary writers seem to have been generally pessimistic about the step-parent relationships that these remarriages created, the evidence of diaries and autobiographies from the period suggest that they were often <b>highly</b> <b>successful,</b> with many children remembering their step-parents with genuine affection.|$|E

50|$|Sirk's melodramas of the 1950s, while <b>highly</b> commercially <b>successful,</b> were {{generally}} very poorly received by reviewers.
