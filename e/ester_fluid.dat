40|$|Because of {{a number}} of {{exceptional}} properties over mineral oil, ester fluids are now being used in more medium and large power transformers. At the same time, there are significant differences in the dielectric & thermal properties and other material parameters, between mineral oil and ester fluids, which need to be considered in the design, manufacture, retro – filling, and service of these transformers. This paper presents results of investigations, calculations, and measurements made to identify the special material characteristics that need to be considered when designing the core and windings of these transformers. The paper also presents the factors that must be considered in the selection, design, and determination of the voltage and current ratings of bushings and tap – changers to be used in <b>ester</b> <b>fluid</b> – filled power transformers. In addition, the paper identifies properties of ester fluids that would require different procedures in the processing of th e fluid during manufacture and impregnation of the solid insulation in the transformer. The factors that should be considered when an old mineral oil – filled power transformer is to be retro – filled with an <b>ester</b> <b>fluid</b> are presented. These allow the transformer to benefit from the advantages of the <b>ester</b> <b>fluid</b> but not negatively impact its performance and reliability during future years of service. During transformer service, some oil quality parameters of ester fluids; such as power factor, acidity, interfacial tension, etc do not reflect the same correlation to fluid dielectric or thermal performance as they do in mineral oil. Also, some diagnostic parameters which determine the condition of the solid insulation in a mineral oil - filled power transformers will need to be considered differently in relationship to the different properties of ester fluids. Finally, the paper presents how the advantageous property of longer life of cellulose in ester fluids could be evaluated and benefited from, resulting in more optimized design of <b>ester</b> <b>fluid</b> – filled power transformers...|$|E

This study aimed to investigate {{the effect of the}} natural ester oil on the aging of cellulose insulation paper if used as an alternative insulating fluid in transformers. Thermally upgraded insulation paper was aged in both insulating fluids together with strips of galvanized steel, copper and aluminium to represent the transformer, under nitrogen pressure in a sealed mild steel pressure vessel for 150 degC for 28, 56, and 84 days. The degradation after aging was assessed using tensile strength and breakdown strength measurements of the paper. The paper samples impregnated with natural <b>ester</b> <b>fluid</b> exhibited similar behavior before and after aging, with an approximately 5 % reduction in tensile strength after 28 days of ageing. Two sets of response were obtained for paper samples aged in mineral insulating oil under the same ageing conditions; the paper closer to the copper strips had a faster degradation rate (~ 35 % reduction). The natural <b>ester</b> <b>fluid</b> retarded the aging of the Kraft paper. The characteristic breakdown strength of natural ester impregnated paper was found to be, on the average, 42 % better than that of mineral oil impregnated paper...|$|E

30|$|Although the formulating cost of BBDF {{is higher}} than OBDF, {{in view of the}} great {{environmental}} acceptability BBDF, the increase of total drilling cost caused by replacing OBDF with BBDF would be probably not that significant. As known, the regulations on ester-based drilling fluids are relatively looser than other non-aqueous-based drilling fluids. For example, the U.S. Effluent Guidelines proposed that the retention of drilling fluid on cuttings (ROC) for <b>ester</b> <b>fluids</b> should not be over 9.4  % (by wet weight), while this limitation for internal olefin fluids is 6.9  % (Friedheim et al. 2001; Klein et al. 2003). This implies that BBDF is easier to be treated and disposed than other non-aqueous-based drilling fluids, which makes it acceptable for drilling contractors. Moreover, as discussed above, the booming of the biodiesel industry and increasing supporting policies would hopefully make the cost of BBDF experience a further cut in the future. To summarize, BBDF is economically feasible as long as its eligible operational performances are ensured.|$|R

Moisture saturation curves for natural and synthetic esters have been presented in the temperature range up to 140 °C together with curve for mineral oil as a reference. Sorption isotherms have been established for cellulose based and aramid fiber based materials. Eventually, the moisture equilibrium diagrams have been created for given combinations of solids and liquids. Moisture equilibrium curves have been created for combinations of mineral oil and <b>ester</b> <b>fluids</b> with aramid fiber based papers and boards, as they are commonly used in alternative insulation systems.

It has been observed that insulation components made of aramid insulation may have lower water content comparing to cellulose based conventional materials at the same water content measured in dielectric liquid.

40|$|The EHD {{friction}} {{properties of}} a wide range of base fluids have been measured and compared in mixed sliding???rolling conditions at three temperatures and two pressures. The use of tungsten carbide ball and disc specimens enabled high mean contact pressures of 1. 5 and 2. 0 ??GPa to be obtained, comparable to those present in many rolling bearings. The measurements confirm the importance of molecular structure of the base fluid in determining EHD friction. Liquids having linear-shaped molecules with flexible bonds give considerably lower friction than liquids based on molecules with bulky side groups or rings. EHD friction also increases with viscosity for liquids having similar molecular structures. Using pure <b>ester</b> <b>fluids,</b> it is shown that quite small differences in molecular structure can have considerable effects on EHD friction.

40|$|Elastomers are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used materials for various sealing applications owing to their low modulus of elasticity, large elongation-at-break, and high Poisson's ratio. Most seals operate in the presence of lubricants; therefore the sealing elastomeroil interaction {{plays an important role in}} determining the tribological performance of elastomers. Furthermore, at times, such as starting up periods, the seals may also operate under dry condition and the seal material can be affected by high friction coefficient and wear. In this work, the tribological behaviour of different sealing elastomers has been studied. The influence of ageing of a sealing elastomer in different lubricants on its tribological behaviour has been investigated. Further studies pertaining to the influence of lubrication on the abrasive wear of a sealing elastomer have also been carried out. The results show that the friction coefficient of an elastomer in lubricated sliding against a hard counterface, at low contact pressure, depends on the surface topography of the elastomer but at high contact pressure, it is mainly due to the viscoelastic deformations of the rubber by the counterface surface asperities. (Even if the hard surface appears smooth to the naked eye, it may exhibit short-wavelength roughness, which may make the dominant contribution to rubber friction). Ageing of the nitrile rubber in <b>ester</b> base <b>fluids</b> leads to reduction of friction coefficient. In unidirectional dry sliding of an elastomer against a counterface, the friction coefficient decreases during the running-in period. The longest running-in periods have been observed when the elastomers slide against relatively smooth surfaces. Depending on the elastomer-lubricant compatibility, abrasive coarseness, geometry of sliding contact area and contact pressure, the two body abrasive wear of elastomers may increase or decrease in presence of lubricants. Aging of nitrile rubber in lubricating fluids increases the abrasive wear both in dry and lubricated conditions. The abrasive wear of nitrile rubber in <b>ester</b> base <b>fluids</b> and rapeseed oil are higher than that in the mineral oils.

40|$|The {{lubricants}} of {{the future}} {{have to be more}} environmentally adapted, show a higher level of performance, and give a lower total life cycle cost (LCC) than the lubricants that are used today. One way to be able to produce, choose and formulate these lubricants is to have good knowledge about the properties of the base fluids and their additive response. The base fluid properties can be divided into four different groups, i. e. physical, chemical, film formation properties and additive response. This thesis is based on the results from the Swedish HiMeC research project "Environmentally adapted lubricants for high performance components". A number of different environmentally adapted <b>ester</b> <b>fluids,</b> suitable for formulation of environmentally adapted lubricants were investigated according to properties, molecular structure and film formation capability. I t was found that both thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity are high for the esters compared to mineral fluids. There is a strong correlation between the number of carboxylate groups and the thermal conductivity. The film formation capability was investigated by the use of optical interferometry in a ball and disc apparatus. A new model for measuring the running in performance of mechanical components was developed. The tests are run un-accelerated, with the same contact pressure and speed as the real applications they represent. The method is based on a tribotest and exact measurement of the surface topography at the exact same spot before and after the test. The most interesting parameters to monitor were found to be Rdq and Rpk. It was found that even very small changes at the uppermost parts of the topography can be measured and monitored whit this method. The additive response for both traditional anti wear additives and specially designed more polar additives where studied. The test where performed at Iwate University in Japan. A modified Falex pin and vee block tribotest machine where used. It was found that the new type of additives is efficient but {{further research is needed to}} be able to formulate fluid based on this chemistry. When putting all together, it could be seen that it will be possible to tailor make base fluids with suitable properties and additivate them with the correct additives for the task they should perform. That will make it possible to achieve better results than the fluids used to day in both environmental and performance aspects. Godkänd; 2006; 20070315 (evan...|$|R

Ag 8. 653. Selection based on [1, 2 - 3 H]GA 4 methyl ester binding capacity yielded two stable hybridoma clones that secreted antibodies of the IgGl subclass. These MAB exhibited high affinities for GA 4 methyl ester (3. 2 × 108 and 1. 0 × 109 M− 1) which allowed quantitation by HPLC-RIA of nanogram or sub-nanogram amounts of the gibberellins A 2, A 3, A 4 A 7 and A 9 as the methyl <b>esters,</b> in biological <b>fluids...</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The superior qualities of ceramics such as high hardness, chemical stability and wear resistance make them promising tribological materials for machine elements, for example, pumps, bearings and heat engines. Ceramics are hard and brittle, therefore, machining such materials is time-consuming, difficult and expensive. A low cost machining process that can remove material rapidly while maintaining a good surface finish is required. The general aim of the studies presented {{is to find a}} correlation between the wear mechanisms and surface modifications induced by interactions of tribochemical nature and to identify the most effective combination of parameters involved in producing high material removal rates of ceramics. This study concentrates on silicon nitride, as this material has most potential for use in industry. The influence of lubricant chemistry on the friction and wear of silicon nitride is investigated using a ball-on -plate tribotester and a modified four-ball machine. A wide variety of liquid lubricants and additives supplied by Castrol International are tested to evaluate the role of the chemical characteristics of the lubricant on the friction and wear of silicon nitride. Surface and chemical analysis results reveal that by using different chemistries of liquids, the material removal rate and the surface finish of the silicon nitride can be significantly altered. The highest material removal rate is obtained when using the <b>ester</b> base <b>fluid</b> T 80884 + 0. 3...|$|R
