5000|$|Like the <b>knee</b> <b>jerk</b> <b>reflex,</b> the Lazarus sign is {{an example}} of a reflex {{mediated}} by a reflex arc—a neural pathway which passes via the spinal column but not through the brain. As a consequence, the movement is possible in brain-dead patients whose organs have been kept functioning by life-support machines, precluding the use of complex involuntary motions as a test for brain activity. It has been suggested by neurologists studying the phenomenon that increased awareness of this and similar reflexes [...] "may prevent delays in brain-dead diagnosis and misinterpretations." ...|$|E

[...] Although stretch reflex gives just qualitative information about muscle spindles and reflex arch activity; if the purpose of the test to compare performances from different subjects, H-reflex should be used. In that case, in fact, latencies (ms) and amplitudes (mV) of H-wave can be compared.|$|E

50|$|Westphal's sign is the {{clinical}} correlate {{of the absence}} or decrease of patellar <b>reflex</b> or <b>knee</b> <b>jerk.</b> Patellar <b>reflex</b> or <b>knee</b> <b>jerk</b> {{is a kind of}} deep or stretch reflex where an application of a stimulus to the patellar tendon such as strike by a solid object or hammer caused the leg to extend due to such stimulus causes the quadriceps femoris muscle to contract.|$|R
50|$|Reflexes {{can be very}} simple, as in the monosynaptic reflex, {{which only}} {{contains}} one synapse, or more complicated, as in the polysynaptic reflex, which involves more than one synapse. The <b>knee</b> <b>jerk</b> <b>reflex</b> is a common example of a monosynaptic reflex when one {{is looking at the}} quadriceps motor response of kicking your leg out. It can also be used {{as an example of a}} polysynaptic reflex when looking at the involvement of inhibitory interneurons to relax the hamstrings. The complexity of the reflex can be estimated by examining the time delay, or latency, between the electrical stimulation of the sensory neuron and the corresponding motor response, as measured by EMG (electromyography). Most reflexes can be categorized in one of three groups depending on the latency of EMG response. The short-latency reflex (SLR) is the fastest (~40-50 ms) and involves a mono-synaptic pathway. The medium-latency reflex (MLR) utilizes interneurons within the spinal cord and is typically ~80-90 ms. The long-latency reflex (LLR) is ~120-140 ms, suggesting that it is mediated by additional supraspinal input from the brain.|$|E
5000|$|One of Unzer’s main {{contributions}} to science was {{the introduction of}} afferent and efferent reflexes. [...] At its most basic level, afferent reflexes are those that move inward from something external, making {{its way to the}} central nervous system. Efferent then is the opposite, where the central nervous system triggers a reflex in the muscles. Unzer himself explains afferent reflexes: [...] "To the end that an impression is felt…the external impression will have no other reflex action in the animal machines than that which is capable in virtue of its purely animal force, which it reflects upon the motor nerves…". He also goes on to explain efferent reflexes: [...] "If, on the other hand, the external impression be also felt, then the mind, according to its psychological laws, connects volitionally with it many other conceptions, the internal impressions of which can produce through the motor nerves such sentient actions as the unfelt external impression could not have developed at all, or, at least, not in combination with the will of the animal. An example of the afferent reflex would be the traditional Patellar Reflex, which is also called the <b>knee</b> <b>jerk</b> <b>reflex.</b> An example of the efferent reflex may be the sucking reflex babies have at birth. He used reflexes to validate the point that animals without developed brains lack strong motor skills: [...] "...we find animals without brain and without any traces of the mind, to be capable of very few kinds of movements".|$|E
40|$|Although the <b>knee</b> <b>jerk</b> <b>reflex</b> is {{mediated}} by the L 3 and L 4 nerve roots, evidence exists that altered knee jerk expression may occur with exclusively L 5 radiculopathy. The present study set out to identify the factors responsible for <b>knee</b> <b>jerk</b> <b>reflex</b> abnormalities in L 5 monoradiculopathy. We analyzed clinical and electrophysiological data in 56 subjects affected by L 5 monoradiculopathy. Seventeen patients (30. 3 %) showed an abnormal knee reflex. L 5 patients with an abnormal knee reflex differed significantly, in severity of pretibial muscle damage, from those with a normal knee reflex. On the basis of evidence, in humans, of a specific spinal pathway linking the pretibial and quadriceps muscles, we infer that an impairment of the proprioceptive drive from the pretibial muscles to spinal premotor excitatory interneurons contacting quadriceps motor neurons is the main causative factor responsible for reducing knee jerk expression. This mechanism should be considered to avoid misinterpretation of <b>knee</b> <b>jerk</b> <b>reflex</b> changes in lumbar radiculopathie...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Spasticity is {{a common}} {{impairment}} accompanying stroke. Spasticity of the quadriceps femoris muscle can be quantified using the pendulum test. The measurement properties of pendular kinematics captured using a magnetic tracking system has not been studied among patients who have experienced a stroke. Therefore, this study describes the test-retest reliability and known groups and convergent validity of the pendulum test measures obtained with the Polhemus tracking system. Methods Eight patients with chronic stroke underwent pendulum tests with their affected and unaffected lower limbs, with and without {{the addition of a}} 2. 2 kg cuff weight at the ankle, using the Polhemus magnetic tracking system. Also measured bilaterally were knee resting angles, Ashworth scores (grades 0 – 4) of quadriceps femoris muscles, patellar tendon (<b>knee</b> <b>jerk)</b> <b>reflexes</b> (grades 0 – 4), and isometric knee extension force. Results Three measures obtained from pendular traces of the affected side were reliable (intraclass correlation coefficient ≥. 844). Known groups validity was confirmed by demonstration of {{a significant difference in the}} measurements between sides. Convergent validity was supported by correlations ≥. 57 between pendulum test measures and other measures reflective of spasticity. Conclusion Pendulum test measures obtained with the Polhemus tracking system from the affected side of patients with stroke have good test-retest reliability and both known groups and convergent validity. </p...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate if acute WBV exposure affects the stretch induced <b>knee</b> <b>jerk</b> <b>reflex</b> [onset latency and electromechanical delay (EMD) ] and the isokinetic knee extensor peak torque performance. Twenty-two subjects were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. The intervention group received WBV in a semi-squat position at 30 ° knee flexion with an amplitude of 0. 69 mm, frequency of 45 Hz, and peak acceleration of 27. 6 m/s 2 for 3 minutes. The control group underwent the same semii-squatting position statically without exposure of WBV. Two-way mixed repeated measures analysis of variance revealed no significant group effects differences on reflex latency of rectus femoris (RF) and vastus lateralis (VL; p = 0. 934 and 0. 935, respectively) EMD of RF and VL (p = 0. 474 and 0. 551, respectively) and peak torque production (p = 0. 483) measured before and after the WBV. The results of this study indicate that a single session of WBV exposure has no potentiation effect on the stretch induced reflex and peak torque performance in healthy young adults.

40|$|Successful {{neuronal}} regeneration in {{the distal}} {{portion of the}} spinal cord following its transsection by transposition of the intercostal nerves {{has been reported in}} both animal experiments and clinical cases by Freeman. In clinical materials however, none of the cases have survived long enough to actually observe its clinical affect. Neuronal regeneration by the above procedure has been proved only on autopsy cases. Since September 1961, 8 operations were performed for the purpose of observing the actual clinical affects of this operation and fortunately none of the operated cases died in the long-term follow-up period. The surgical operation was limited only to those who had traumatic transsection of the cord at the dorsal of lumber level and were also paraplegic for at least 7 months. Two pairs of intercostal nerves were mobilized and brought down to the level of conus medullaris or lumber 3 rd or 4 th motor nerve roots in the cauda equina. A special nerve anastomosing instrument was used for the anastomosis in all eight cases. Very satisfactory return of motor function was obtained in only one case and return of the <b>knee</b> <b>jerk</b> <b>reflex</b> was seen in only one case. Some of cases have not had a long enough post-operative period to confirm any type of conclusion. It appears that this operation will have a better chance if it is performed, in a relatively early post-traumatic period and in younger persons. There is no further destructive affect to the post-traumatic status following this operation; therefore, further clinical evaluation with some technical improvement is suggested...|$|E
40|$|Aim: This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the neuromuscular adaptation following a 5 -week high frequency and low amplitude whole body vibration (WBV) exercise training. Methods: The study is a prospective, double blind, randomized controlled intervention design {{with a total of}} 19 subjects volunteered to participate in the study. They were randomly assigned either to WBV exercise training or control group. Both groups participated in a 5 -week training program. The intervention group received WBV in semi-squat position on a device with an amplitude of 0. 76 mm, frequency of 40 Hz, and peak acceleration of 23. 9 m/s 2. Each vibration training session consisted of 6 series of 60 s on with 30 s rest period in between. The control group underwent the same statically mini-squatting position without exposure to WBV. The effectiveness of the vibration program was evaluated by vertical jump test and the isokinetic knee extensor peak torque. The possible neural factors that contributed to the improved muscular performance were evaluated by the stretch induced <b>knee</b> <b>jerk</b> <b>reflex.</b> Results: WBV training significantly enhanced the isokinetic knee extensor peak torque performance. Two-way mixed repeated measures analysis of variance revealed signiicant time effect of the changes in the peak torque (P= 0. 043) and the effect was signiicantly different between the intervention and control group (P= 0. 042). WBV did not affect vertical jump height, relex latency of VL, EMGVL, and knee jerk angle. Conclusion: The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that the improvement in the muscular performance when subjects exposed to WBV training is attributed by neuromuscular efficiency via modulation of the muscle spindle sensitivity.

40|$|Introduction: Cerebral palsy (CP) is a {{relatively}} frequently occurring developmental problem. It is caused by brain lesions that occur during early development. Notwithstanding its relatively high prevalence, early prediction of CP remains difficult. Therefore, part of the research at the Institutue of Developmental Neurology at the University of Groningen (UMCG) aims finding parameters which can predict at early development which infants are at risk to develop CP. In the Learn 2 Move 0 - 2 years (L 2 M 0 - 2) study, in which infants with a high risk for CP are examined neurologically, some infants showed a tonic response at the knee jerk instead of the normal short phasic response. This phenomenon has not been described; {{it could be an}} early predictor of CP later in life. Methods: This explorative patient study included 15 infants from the L 2 M 0 - 2 study with a high risk to develop CP. Knee jerk of the infants had been examined at four moments until the age of 21 months. The existing knee jerk data consisted of video and EMG-recordings of leg-, arm-, shoulder-, nek- and trunk muscles during multiple knee jerks per asssessment. The videos were analysed with a standardized scoring form and the EMG data with the PedEMG program. Statistics mainly consisted of descriptive statistics, occasionally non-parametric tests where used to explore possible associations. Results: The infants at high risk for CP showed occassionally to frequently tonical activity in response to the knee jerk. The frequency and duration of the tonic responses varied substantially and did not change over time. Tonic activity in response to the knee jerk was not asssociated with the development of CP at 21 months. However, a negative association was observed between tonical responses and the occurrence of reciprocal excitation (contraction of the agonist muscle) and <b>knee</b> <b>jerk</b> <b>reflex</b> irradiation. Conclusion: The results of this explorative study showed that infants at high risk for CP relatively often show a tonic response at the knee jerk. The occurrence of the tonic responses was not associated with the development of CP at the age of 21 months. Further research with healthy infants is needed to see if tonic responses are also seen in this group, to elucidate whether tonic responses are part of typical myotatic reflex development. ...|$|E
50|$|The jaw <b>jerk</b> <b>reflex</b> or the {{masseter}} reflex is {{a stretch}} reflex {{used to test}} the status of a patient's trigeminal nerve (CN V) and to help distinguish an upper cervical cord compression from lesions that are above the foramen magnum.
