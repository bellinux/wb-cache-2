A popular variation in north India is the Gajar Ka Halwa carrot dessert, which has carrots <b>grated</b> and cooked in milk until the whole mixture is solid, after which nuts and butter are added. Carrot salads are usually made with <b>grated</b> carrots with a seasoning of mustard seeds and green chillies popped in hot oil.

40|$|To avoid extreme {{temperatures}} and reducing conditions along combustion <b>grate</b> surfaces {{reducing the risk}} of <b>grate</b> material deterioration-the configuration and out-placing of air passages through a <b>grate</b> have been investigated by mathematical modeling. In the two-dimensional CFD-simulations of wood-char combustion On top of the <b>grate,</b> the number and width of the air passages through the <b>grate</b> were varied. The different <b>grate</b> configurations were further investigated for different air flux rates and for the recirculation of flue gases to the combustion air. The results of the simulation; show that the maximal temperature in the <b>grate</b> is sensitive to the amount of air fed to the bed and,,at constant air flow rate, to the entering velocity of the combustion air to the fuel bed. The possibility of using the air flow, as a control parameter in modern <b>grate</b> :Furnaces is limited, due to a general wish to reduce the air flow through the <b>grate</b> to reduce nitric oxide emissions. Extreme temperatures in the <b>grate</b> should, therefore, according to the modelin;, be avoided by making sure that the entering velocity of the air to the Fuel bed is sufficiently high. Practically, this can be achieved by reducing the number of passages in the <b>grate,</b> or by introducing flue-gas recycling. However, to avoid areas of reducing conditio as along the <b>grate,</b> the number of passages should not be reduced further than resulting in a maximal distance of 4 - 5 cm between them, when working with pure air...|$|R

Finely <b>grated</b> potassium ignites in air at room temperature. The bulk metal ignites in air if heated. Because its density is 0.89 g/cm3, burning potassium floats in water that exposes it to atmospheric oxygen. Many common fire extinguishing agents, including water, either are ineffective or make a potassium fire worse. Nitrogen, argon, sodium chloride (table salt), sodium carbonate (soda ash), and silicon dioxide (sand) are effective if they are dry. Some Class D dry powder extinguishers designed for metal fires are also effective. These agents deprive the fire of oxygen and cool the potassium metal.|$|E

5|$|Around 1770 {{the neoclassical}} {{architect}} Robert Adam designed Pulteney Bridge, using as the prototype for the three-arched bridge spanning the Avon an original, but unused, design by Andrea Palladio for the Rialto Bridge in Venice. Thus, Pulteney Bridge became {{not just a}} means of crossing the river, but also a shopping arcade. Along with the Rialto Bridge and the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, which it resembles, {{it is one of}} the very few surviving bridges in Europe to serve this dual purpose. It has been substantially altered since it was built. The bridge was named after Frances and William Pulteney, the owners of the Bathwick estate for which the bridge provided a link to the rest of Bath. The Georgian streets in the vicinity of the river tended to be built high above the original ground level to avoid flooding, with the carriageways supported on vaults extending in front of the houses. This can be seen in the multi-storey cellars around Laura Place South of Pulteney Bridge, in the colonnades below Grand Parade, and in the <b>grated</b> coal holes in the pavement of North Parade. In some parts of the city, such as George Street, and London Road near Cleveland Bridge, the developers of the opposite side of the road did not match this pattern, leaving raised pavements with the ends of the vaults exposed to a lower street below.|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to examine the compression-induced state of stress arising in {{castings}} of the guide <b>grates</b> during operation in pusher-type furnaces for heat treatment.
