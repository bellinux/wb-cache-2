Papers by Paul Romer were particularly influential in igniting the revival of growth research. Beginning in the mid-1980s and booming in the early 1990s many macroeconomists shifted their focus to the long-run and started [...] "new growth" [...] theories, including <b>endogenous</b> <b>growth.</b> Growth economists sought to explain empirical facts including the failure of sub-Saharan Africa to catch up in growth, the booming East Asian Tigers, and the slowdown in productivity growth in the United States prior to the technology boom of the 1990s.

This finding suggests that the observed slope of the income - life satisfaction curve is uninformative about human behavior driven by referencedependent utility.

"The {{entrepreneur}} is {{a factor}} in microeconomics, and the study of entrepreneurship reaches back to the work of Richard Cantillon and Adam Smith in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, but was largely ignored theoretically until the late 19th and early 20th centuries and empirically until a profound resurgence in business and economics in the last 40 years. In the 20th century, the understanding of entrepreneurship owes much to the work of economist Joseph Schumpeter in the 1930s and other Austrian economists such as Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich von Hayek. According to Schumpeter, an entrepreneur is a person who is willing and able to convert a new idea or invention into a successful innovation. Entrepreneurship employs what Schumpeter called [...] "the gale of creative destruction" [...] to replace {{in whole or in part}} inferior innovations across markets and industries, simultaneously creating new products including new business models. In this way, creative destruction is largely responsible for the dynamism of industries and long-run economic growth.

Mean percentage of ideal body weight was significantly higher in the Turner's syndrome group than among controls and it increased with age. There was a strong inverse relationship between mean growth hormone concentration and percentage of ideal body weight in those with Turner's syndrome.

The occupational choice of skill-differentiated workers into low-skilled employment in production and high-skilled employment in innova- tion determines labor market allocations, and perfect investment mobility allows firms to shift innovation and manufacturing independently between countries. These mechanisms generate a tension between access to technical knowledge and low-cost high-skilled labor in the location decision for innovation, which results in innovation and manufacturing tending to concentrate in the asset-wealthy (asset-poor) country when trade costs are high (low). The model exhibits {{a positive relationship between}} innovation costs and the concentration of industry and innovation, ensuring that a rise in knowledge diffusion between countries coincides with increases in net offshoring flows in innovation and manufacturing from the asset-wealthy country to the asset-poor country, and a faster rate of productivity growth, when the asset-wealthy country has larger shares of innovation and production. innovation offshoring, manufacturing offshoring, <b>endogenous</b> productivity <b>growth,</b> process innovation, industry location, international trad...|$|R
