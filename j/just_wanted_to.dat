5|$|Due to lost {{communications}} with Battalion and then Regimental headquarters, and the unit's subsequent capture, its disposition and success at delaying {{the advance of}} the 6th Panzer Army that day was unknown to U.S. commanders. Lt. Lyle Bouck considered the wounding of most of his men and the capture of his entire unit a failure. When the war ended five months later, the platoon's men, who were split between two prisoner-of-war camps, <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get home. It was only after the war that Bouck learned that his platoon had prevented the lead German infantry elements from advancing and had delayed by about 20 hours their armored units' advance. On October 26, 1981, after considerable lobbying, a Congressional hearing, and letter-writing by Bouck, {{every member of the}} unit were finally recognized for their valor that day, making the platoon most decorated American unit of its size of World War II.|$|E
5|$|Fox {{negotiated}} a deal which would prove extremely lucrative for Groening, {{in which he}} retained {{a large portion of}} revenue from merchandising. To animate the short segments, Brooks and company settled on Klasky Csupo, a small animation house who offered to produce the cartoons cheaply. Brooks initially <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> animate the shorts through the basic line drawings, and Klasky-Csupo offered color for the same cost. The studio only employed three young animators—CalArts graduates Bill Kopp, Wes Archer, and David Silverman—who adapted Groening's scripts for animation in one week, doing layouts, animation and inbetweening by hand in the very short amount of time. Groening submitted only basic sketches to the three, and assumed that the figures would be cleaned-up in production. However, the animators merely re-traced his drawings, which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial short episodes. Colorist Gyorgyi Peluce was the person who decided to make the characters yellow.|$|E

A few years ago, Jeanfils was certain to get a gift of healing by treating knee and foot sprains {{of his wife and}} himself, and was then consulted by patients in Jemeppe.

25|$|Tristan (2011) by Hogan was a {{follow up}} film to Yajilarra and was {{commissioned}} by Oscar and the Lililwan Project, The George and the University of Sydney Discipline of Paediatrics and Child Health. The documentary {{was part of the}} campaign to support children affected by FASD. When Tristan was released, the Australian government had yet to recognise FASD as a disability. Tristan highlighted the danger in drinking alcohol in pregnancy by portraying the struggle of a 12-year old Aboriginal boy who suffered from severe FASD. The boy lived in Fitzroy Crossing, loved Australian rules football and was much like other boys his age. Hogan’s film told how Tristan struggled more than the other children in his family who were less affected by FASD, needed to have regular breaks when focusing on a task, and often needed to have instructions repeated to him. His uncle was worried the police and other authorities could easily misunderstand his inability to communicate, or comprehend the consequences of his actions. But Tristan wanted to become a policeman one day and <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be ‘normal’. Tristan was shown at the 11th session of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in New York, from 7 to 18 May 2012. The film concluded with a message from Oscar: “The attitude of society towards FASD must change, since the children with the condition can’t”.|$|E
