He also dealt with the 1976 shootings and Axe Murder Incident in the Korean <b>Demilitarized</b> <b>Zone,</b> and oversaw the Panama Canal Treaty in 1977.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Korean War, between 1953 and 1971, the 7th Infantry Division defended the Korean <b>Demilitarized</b> <b>Zone.</b> Its main {{garrison}} was Camp Casey, South Korea. During this period, the division was restructured in compliance with the Reorganization Objective Army Divisions tables of organization. In 1963, the division's former headquarters company grew into the 1st Brigade, 7th Infantry Division. On 2 April 1971, the division and its brigades returned to the United States and inactivated at Fort Lewis, Washington.|$|E

5|$|North Vietnam's {{victory over}} the South led to a {{considerable}} shift in the political winds in Asia, and Ford administration officials worried about a consequent loss of U.S. influence there. The administration proved it was willing to respond forcefully to challenges to its {{interests in the region}} on two occasions, once when Khmer Rouge forces seized an American ship in international waters and again when American military officers were killed in the <b>demilitarized</b> <b>zone</b> (DMZ) between North and South Korea.|$|E
5|$|The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 recognizes Norwegian sovereignty, and the 1925 Svalbard Act made Svalbard a full {{part of the}} Kingdom of Norway. The {{archipelago}} is administrated by the Governor of Svalbard, {{which is}} subordinate to the Norwegian Ministry of Justice and the Police. Unlike the rest of Norway (including Jan Mayen), Svalbard is a free economic zone and a <b>demilitarized</b> <b>zone,</b> and {{is not part of}} the Schengen Area nor the European Economic Area.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1962, United States Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara visited South Vietnam and {{was taken}} on an {{inspection}} tour of the country, accompanied by Diệm and Thảo. Perhaps because Thảo divulged the tour details to Vietcong guerrillas, each of McNamara's stopovers was punctuated by bloody attacks on nearby ARVN installations. For example, when McNamara was in Bình Dương Province, five government soldiers were killed. As he flew from Đà Lạt north to Đà Nẵng near the <b>Demilitarized</b> <b>Zone,</b> he was greeted by a Vietcong bombing of a southbound troop train, which killed 27 and wounded 30 Civil Guard members.|$|E

50|$|Israel argued {{this was}} {{motivated}} by security considerations linked with the situation at the borders.

5000|$|A {{buffer zone}} is {{generally}} a [...] area that lies between {{two or more}} other areas (often, but not necessarily, countries), but {{depending on the type}} of buffer zone, the reason for it may be to segregate regions or to conjoin them.Common types of buffer <b>zones</b> are <b>demilitarized</b> <b>zones,</b> border zones and certain restrictive easement zones and green belts.

5|$|Primarily {{the brainchild}} of General Nguyen Chi Thanh, the {{upcoming}} offensive would be timed to provoke a popular general uprising among the South Vietnamese people against the government and its American supporters. Yet prudence required that the South Vietnamese maintain 50 per cent of their forces on standby, while American and allied forces under General William Westmoreland—the Free World Military Forces—remained on full alert. However, despite such measures the fighting at Khe Sanh had largely succeeded in diverting American resources and attention away from Saigon and towards the <b>demilitarized</b> <b>zone,</b> affording the communists the element of surprise.|$|E
5|$|The Bunche and Bunker mission {{gave birth}} to the idea of an {{observer}} mission to Yemen, which eventually became the United Nations Yemen Observation Mission. The U.N. observer team, which would be set up by the former UN Congo commander, Swedish Major General Carl von Horn. His disengagement agreement called for (1) Establishment of a <b>demilitarized</b> <b>zone</b> extending twenty kilometers on either side of a demarcated Saudi Arabian Yemen border, from which all military equipment was to be excluded; (2) Stationing of UN observers within this zone {{on both sides of the}} border to observe, report and prevent any continued attempt by the Saudis to supply royalist forces.|$|E
5|$|The plateau {{camp was}} {{permanently}} manned by the US Marines during 1967, when they established an outpost {{next to the}} airstrip. This base was {{to serve as the}} western anchor of Marine Corps forces, which had tactical responsibility for the five northernmost provinces of South Vietnam known as I Corps. The Marines' defensive system stretched below the <b>Demilitarized</b> <b>Zone</b> (DMZ) from the coast, along Route 9, to Khe Sanh. During 1966 the regular Special Forces troops had moved off the plateau and built a smaller camp down Route 9 at Lang Vei, about half the distance to the Laotian border.|$|E

5|$|After the 1953 armistice, {{the defense}} of the Korean <b>Demilitarized</b> <b>Zone</b> was handled by the South Korean and American armies. The eastern half of the border was handled by the South Korean Army while I Corps took charge in the west. For the next 18 years, the corps oversaw US forces on the DMZ, seeing only {{occasional}} incidents with the North Korean army. In 1971, under Nixon's détente policy, the 7th Infantry Division was withdrawn, leaving the 2nd Infantry Division as the only US Army unit in Korea. I Corps remained in Korea as a two-division formation until 1972 when it was reduced to zero strength and was replaced in 1982 by the Third Republic of Korea Army (TROKA).|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Korean War, between 1953 and 1971, the 7th Infantry Division defended the Korean <b>Demilitarized</b> <b>Zone.</b> Its main {{garrison}} was Camp Casey, South Korea.

In 1963, the division's former headquarters company grew into the 1st Brigade, 7th Infantry Division while the 13th Infantry Brigade became the 2nd Brigade, 7th Infantry Division. The 14th Infantry Brigade redesignated at the 3rd Brigade, 7th Infantry Division. These renamed formations retained all of the lineage and campaign credits of their previous designations. On 2 April 1971, the division and its brigades returned to the United States and inactivated at Fort Lewis, Washington.|$|E

50|$|The 1949 Armistice Agreements which {{followed}} the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, created three <b>demilitarized</b> <b>zones</b> on the Israel-Syria border.

25|$|Unlike Israel's {{southern}} border, however, {{its northern}} border with Syria {{was prone to}} further conflicts, rooted in disputes over the nature and boundaries of Israel's <b>demilitarized</b> <b>zones.</b> These tensions along the border became more complicated in February 1958 {{with the establishment of}} the UAR, a short-lived political union of Egypt and Syria.

5|$|Chakotay's backstory was {{explained}} {{during the course}} of Star Trek: Voyager. He was born in 2329 on a Federation colony near Cardassian space in the <b>demilitarized</b> <b>zone.</b> While young, he was looked after by his grandfather. At the age of 15, Chakotay visited Earth with his father, who sought to find his tribe's ancestral home in Central America and the descendants of the Rubber Tree People. He was resistant to this, and instead dreamed of going into space and had heroes such as John Kelly, a pioneering astronaut in the early 21st century. He chose to enter Starfleet Academy against his father's wishes, and his entry was sponsored by Captain Sulu. He attended Starfleet Academy from 2344 to 2348, where he engaged in the sport of boxing. After graduating, he was assigned to a starship. One of his earliest away missions resulted in a diplomatic incident on Ktaria VII, and he was also on the team that made first contact with the Tarkannans.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 U.S. recon {{photographs}} uncovered {{an unusual}} sight. POL barrels were spotted {{floating in the}} waters of the Kong River south of Ban Bak, Laos. Soon, PAVN was making use of the Banghiang River which flowed southwestward from the <b>Demilitarized</b> <b>Zone</b> {{all the way to the}} Mekong River, for the same purposes. The watertight drums were launched en masse from tributary streams into the main channel, floated downstream, and were recovered by systems of nets and booms. The Kaman River was added to the system in 1969. By 1970 the North Vietnamese were making intense use of streams and rivers to supplement their logistical route, especially in the rainy season, when the water levels rose and the roadways became impassable mires. During one two and one-half month period during 1969, over 10,000 POL barrels were spotted in the waterways of southeastern Laos.|$|E
5|$|Plans for the station's {{construction}} {{started in}} the early 1960s and negotiations between ESRO and Norwegian authorities started in 1964, despite Norway's lack of membership in ESRO. An initial disagreement of whether to locate the facility by Ny-Ålesund or Longyearbyen was overcome, and an agreement was signed on 14 December 1964. However, it was followed up by numerous protests from the Soviet Union, which claimed the installation would violate the <b>demilitarized</b> <b>zone</b> clause of the Svalbard Treaty, as the station {{had the potential to}} be used for military satellites and intelligence. The protests were rejected by Norwegian authorities, and construction started in May 1965. The Soviet Union attempted several inspections; one resulted in the crash of a Soviet helicopter. Operations commenced in 1967, but the facility was closed in 1974 as the facility was not suitable for new satellites with higher orbits.|$|E
