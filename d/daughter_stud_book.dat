5|$|The American <b>Stud</b> <b>Book,</b> the {{registration}} book for American Thoroughbreds, was not founded until 1873, much {{later than the}} General <b>Stud</b> <b>Book,</b> and the rules for registration required only that a horse have five generations of ancestors in the American <b>Stud</b> <b>Book</b> or other national <b>stud</b> <b>books,</b> unlike the General <b>Stud</b> <b>Book</b> rules. In addition, many breeding records were destroyed during the American Civil War, as fighting during that conflict took place in noted American Thoroughbred breeding centers. The result was that most American Thoroughbreds in 1913 were unable to show an unblemished pedigree according to the General <b>Stud</b> <b>Book</b> rules. Adding to the problem {{was the fact that}} American horses were beginning to win the big horse races in England, starting with Iroquois, who won the 1881 Epsom Derby.|$|R

With this Order the <b>Stud</b> <b>Book</b> Division became the <b>Stud</b> <b>Book</b> and Animal Registry Division (SBARD), placing it {{under the control of}} the Bureau and Animal Industry (BAI).

500|$|Before the {{introduction}} in 1913 of what became popularly known—"with questionnable taste" [...] {{according to a}} correspondent writing in The Times—as the Jersey Act, Thoroughbred horses in the United Kingdom were registered in the General <b>Stud</b> <b>Book,</b> the <b>stud</b> <b>book</b> for British and Irish Thoroughbreds. The rules allowed a horse to be registered {{if all of the}} horse's ancestors were registered in the General <b>Stud</b> <b>Book</b> or if it had been bred outside of Britain or Ireland and was registered in the <b>stud</b> <b>book</b> of its country of origin. Overall the General <b>Stud</b> <b>Book</b> had the most stringent rules for registration of Thoroughbreds at the time, around 1900; other countries, including the United States, France, Australia and Russia, were considered by the British and Irish to be much laxer and to have allowed some non-Thoroughbred horses into their national <b>stud</b> <b>books.</b>|$|R

50|$|A closed <b>stud</b> <b>book</b> is a <b>stud</b> <b>book</b> or breed {{registry}} {{that does}} not accept any outside blood. The registered animals and all subsequent offspring trace back to the foundation stock. This ensures that the animal is a purebred member of the breed. In horses, {{an example of a}} closed <b>stud</b> <b>book</b> is that of the Thoroughbred, with a <b>stud</b> <b>book</b> tracing to 1791. The American Kennel Club {{is an example of a}} kennel club with primarily closed books for dogs; it allows new breeds to develop under its Foundation Stock Service, but such dogs are not eligible for competition in AKC conformation shows. For the breed to move to the Miscellaneous class and then to fully recognized status, the breed's <b>stud</b> <b>book</b> must be closed.|$|R

50|$|In an open <b>stud</b> <b>book,</b> animals may be {{registered}} {{even if their}} parents or earlier ancestors were not previously registered with that particular entity. Usually an open <b>stud</b> <b>book</b> has strict studbook selection criteria that require an animal to meet a certain standard of conformation, performance or both. This allows breeders to modify breeds by including individuals who conform to the breed standard but are of outside origin. Some horse breeds allow crossbreds who meet specific criteria to {{be registered}}. One example is the semi-open <b>stud</b> <b>book</b> of the American Quarter Horse, which still accepts horses of Thoroughbred breeding, particularly via its appendix registry. Among dogs, {{an example of an}} open <b>stud</b> <b>book</b> would be the registries maintained by the American Kennel Club as its Foundation Stock Service.

500|$|To be {{registered}} as a Finnhorse, a horse must either have parents registered as Finnhorses, or be verified to be descended {{from at least}} three generations of Finnhorses. To qualify for the Finnhorse <b>stud</b> <b>book</b> as a breeding animal, a horse must prove itself by meeting or exceeding the breed standard set for various qualities: performance ability, conformation, disposition, and in some cases, quality of offspring. Any horse offered for the Finnhorse studbook {{must be at least}} 4 years old, a stallion or a mare, and registered a Finnhorse. The <b>stud</b> <b>book</b> evaluation board considers the performance of horses in their desired discipline: riding, driving, harness racing, or workhorse events. Horses to {{be registered}} in the <b>stud</b> <b>book</b> are tested for performance at the <b>stud</b> <b>book</b> registration inspection. With the exception of the trotter section, they are also evaluated on [...] "type"; the suitability of the horse's overall build for the section for which it is offered. Individuals that do not qualify for the studbook on their own merits during the <b>stud</b> <b>book</b> evaluation process may be accepted later, based on the quality and accomplishments of their offspring. For this to occur, a horse's offspring are evaluated by their competitive history or their <b>stud</b> <b>book</b> evaluation, and if of high enough quality, their parent then is also granted acceptance into the <b>stud</b> <b>book.</b> Conversely, a horse may be removed from the studbook if its offspring are found to have any inherited flaw or condition. A stallion may also be removed if his offspring are clearly below the average level in competitive success or <b>stud</b> <b>book</b> evaluations.|$|R

500|$|... {{there is}} a lawsuit in {{progress}} to determine the legal holder of the PRE <b>stud</b> <b>book.</b> The Unión de Criadores de Caballos Españoles (UCCE or Union of Spanish Horse Breeders) has brought a case to the highest European Union courts in Brussels, charging that the Ministry of Spain's transfer of the original PRE Libro de Origen (the official <b>stud</b> <b>book)</b> from the Cria Caballar to ANCCE was illegal. In early 2009, the courts decided on behalf of UCCE, explaining that the Cria Caballar formed the Libro de Origin. Because it was formed by a government entity, it is against European Union law for the <b>stud</b> <b>book</b> {{to be transferred to}} a private entity, a law that was broken by the transfer of the book to ANCCE, which is a non-governmental organization. The court found that by giving ANCCE sole control of the <b>stud</b> <b>book,</b> Spain's Ministry of Defense was acting in a discriminatory manner. The court held that Spain must give permission to maintain a breed <b>stud</b> <b>book</b> (called a Libro Genealógico) to any international association or Spanish national association which requests it. Based on the Brussels court decision, an application has been made by the Foundation for the Pure Spanish Horse to maintain the United States <b>stud</b> <b>book</b> for the PRE. , Spain has not revoked ANCCE's right to be the sole holder of the PRE <b>stud</b> <b>book,</b> and has instead reaffirmed the organization's status.|$|R
