Kyousuke gives Riki and Rin the task of going around school to find more members to join, preferably girls so as not to leave Rin the lone girl. Riki finds five girls his age willing to help him out: Komari Kamikita, Haruka Saigusa, Kudryavka Noumi, Yuiko Kurugaya, and Mio Nishizono; three other girls Riki meets are Kanata Futaki, Sasami Sasasegawa, and Saya Tokido. Throughout the game, Riki hangs out with these girls and learns more about them.|$|E

[...] Thomas {{also said that}} the {{character}} was not created or introduced in a reaction to negative fan opinion towards second season character Jackie Cook (Tessa Thompson). The episode features the first appearance of teaching assistant Tim Foyle (James Jordan; Jordan previously played another character, Lucky, in season 2). In addition, [...] "Welcome Wagon" [...] is the first appearance of the character of Moe Flater. Originally, Michael Cera, who guest starred in [...] "The Rapes of Graff", was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> similar role, but the role of Moe Flater was created after Cera couldn't take the role due to scheduling conflicts.|$|E
500|$|He next {{starred in}} Pineapple Express (2008), a stoner comedy co-starring and co-written by Seth Rogen and {{produced}} by Judd Apatow. Of Franco's character, Apatow said, [...] "You tell him, 'Okay, you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> pot dealer', {{and he comes}} back with a three-dimensional character you totally believe exists. He takes it very seriously, even when it's comedy". In her New York Times review, critic Manohla Dargis wrote: [...] "He's delightful as Saul, loosey-goosey and goofy yet irrepressibly sexy, despite that greasy curtain of hair and a crash pad with a zero WAF (Woman Acceptance Factor). It's an unshowy, generous performance and it greatly humanizes a movie that, as it shifts genre gears and cranks up the noise, becomes disappointingly sober and self-serious". His performance earned him a second Golden Globe nomination, for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy. He has stated in some interviews {{that he no longer}} uses cannabis (although he has occasionally alluded to smoking it, most notably during an extended segment on The Colbert Report). He was awarded High Times magazine's Stoner of the Year Award for his work in Pineapple Express. In 2008 he also appeared in two films by American artist Carter, exhibited at the Yvon Lambert gallery in Paris. On September 20, 2008, he hosted the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live (SNL), and a second time on December 19, 2009.|$|E

500|$|After the [...] {{reception}} to his 2006 gangster film, Pudhupettai, Selvaraghavan took {{a sabbatical}} to plan future projects {{and set up}} a production company, White Elephants, whose first project Idhu Maalai Nerathu Mayakkam started in November 2006. The film was co-produced by new producer R. Ravindran, and the first schedule began with Karthi, whose first film, Paruthiveeran, was awaiting release, and Sandhya. The film was stalled in early 2007 due to cinematographer Arvind Krishna's decision to leave White Elephants and the project was eventually shelved. In July 2007, Selvaraghavan announced a new film with a new team of Karthi and Reemma Sen in the cast, with Ramji replacing regular Arvind Krishna as the cinematographer. Erum Ali, wife of actor Abbas, became the team's head costume designer, whilst, Selvaraghavan's sister-in-law and Rajinikanth's daughter, Aishwarya Dhanush, was signed on as an associate director. The film was named after a popular M. G. Ramachandran film, Aayirathil Oruvan. The producer was announced to be R. Ravindran whilst Yuvan Shankar Raja was appointed as music director following five previous successful soundtracks in Selvaraghavan films. Despite early indications that the director's brother Dhanush was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> guest role, it became evident that the role was subsequently given to R. Parthiepan. Andrea Jeremiah was also signed for a role in the film in October 2007, in her second film after Pachaikili Muthucharam and director-actor Azhagam Perumal followed suit in November 2007.|$|E

2500|$|Mr. Bungle emerged {{after its}} members were kicked out their {{respective}} bands. [...] "It was kinda like a merger between two bands," [...] Mike Patton recalled. [...] "One really horrible gothic metal band, which our guitarist and original drummer were in, and one really horrible metal band which did Metallica covers, {{which is the}} one Trevor and me came from." [...] Mr. Bungle initially described themselves as a death metal band, but also dabbled in speed metal, thrash metal, and hardcore punk. And {{within a year of}} formation, the band expanded their sound to include ska. Trevor Dunn noted that, [...] "After about a year we got tired of playing speed metal and wanted to do something a little more creative. So we just stopped and started writing our own style of music, which was influenced by bands like Camper Van Beethoven, Oingo Boingo, Bad Manners and kind of ska funk-ish oriented stuff. Then we added a two-piece horn section and a new drummer, so now we don't really have any kind of limit on the music we play." [...] Trey Spruance corroborated this. “When I was 15, I was in a death metal group," [...] Spruance reminisced. [...] "We had this idea that we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> bunch of ska tunes for a bunch of metalheads.

There was no way in hell that I thought that we were ever going make a living doing this or that in fourteen years I would still be having a conversation as Greg from Dillinger Escape Plan. I just thought this was a ball of fire that’s gonna implode or it’s got a shelf life, there’s no way this can continue. So when we would get asked to play something like that in my head I was like ‘well, this is never going to happen again, when am I ever <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> festival with bands I don’t like. That was kind of the other thing, {{that was the first time}} we ever played with bands we don’t like.

[...] So it was kind of a combo of kind of wanting to cause the biggest ruckus imaginable, since we’re obviously never going to do this again anyway, I might as well make sure that we’re never allowed to do this again anyway.

2500|$|Ted Bovis (Paul Shane) Camp Host – Ted was {{the camp}} host {{and was very}} popular with the campers. He ran every event – the {{entertainment}} manager just introduced the events. He was born in November 1916 {{and grew up in}} an orphanage. Little is known about his early life except {{that he was one of}} the four Mississippi Minstrels performing at [...] "The Palace" [...] at Attercliffe and had served in the army during World War II. He joined Maplins upon demobilisation in 1945, and has returned every season since. He spent the winter months performing at the Ideal Home Exhibition and the Motor Show. He married Hilary (Rikki Lee) in 1951 but they separated soon afterwards and later divorced. He was always running scams to cheat the campers out of money: these included fake birthdays, raffles, fund-raisers and rigged bingo. One of his most memorable schemes was selling tickets for male campers to view a pornographic film in the middle of the night. Jeffrey Fairbrother tried his best to put a stop to these schemes, but Clive Dempster supported them and often got involved. Ted was the longest-serving employee at Maplins. Ted shared his chalet with Spike throughout the entire sitcom, and briefly with Barry when Yvonne threw him out, and later with Julian Dalrymple-Sykes. Both Barry and Julian hated their time in Ted's chalet because of his disgusting habits. In a later episode, Ted fell in love with Betty Barlow (Caroline Dennis), a young female camper. He planned to marry her, leave Maplins and form an act with her, but he called it off after he discovered that her mother did not approve, and that she had been offered a scholarship, which she hadn't told him about, and he didn't want to hold her back. Throughout the series, Ted often said that he hated his job at Maplins, as he believed his talents were wasted on the lower classes who holidayed there. He often tried to better himself by performing as a comedian at upper-class functions, most of which were unsuccessful. When Maplins modernised after the 1960 season, they no longer required a camp host – what the future held for Ted was left unknown. He revealed that over the winter he had secured a job demonstrating a new potato peeler in supermarkets, and was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> Chinese policeman in a pantomime over Christmas. Despite his regular claims that he hated his job as Camp Host, Ted was genuinely upset to leave Maplins.|$|E
