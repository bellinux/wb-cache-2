40|$|The {{impact of}} polyphosphate-accumulating {{organism}} (PAO) and glycogen-accumulating organism (GAO) populations {{as well as}} of the chemical profile on the performance of Unit- 3 (open elutriation tanks) and Unit- 5 (covered elutriation tank) of the City of Johannesburg Northern Wastewater Treatment Works was determined. Physicochemical parameters of wastewater samples were measured using standard methods. Bacterial diversity was determined using 16 S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing of the variable region V 1 - 3. Results showed soluble COD concentrations from settled sewage for Unit- 3 at 192. 8 mg COD/L and for Unit- 5 at 214. 6 mg COD/L, which increased to 301. 8 mg COD/L and 411. 6 mg COD/L in the overflow from elutriation tanks and decreased to 170. 9 mg COD/L and 256. 3 mg COD/L at the division boxes, respectively. Both long-chain volatile <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (<b>heptanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> isobutyric acid, 3 -methylbutanoic acid, pentanoic acid, 4 -methylpentanoic acid, methylheptanoic acid) and short-chain volatile fatty acids (acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid) were present within concentration ranges of 17. 19 mg/L to 54. 98 mg/L and 13. 64 mg/L to 87. 6 mg/L for Unit 3 and 38. 61 mg/L to 58. 85 mg/L and 21. 63 mg/L to 92. 39 mg/L for Unit 5, respectively. In the secondary settling tanks, the phosphate-removal efficiency in Unit- 5 appeared to be slightly higher (0. 08 mg P/L) compared to that of Unit- 3 (0. 11 mg P/L). The average DO concentrations (2. 1 mg/L and 2. 2 mg/L) as well as the pH values (pH 7 to pH 7. 5) were found to be slightly higher in Unit- 5 in the aerobic zones. The high presence of PAOs in the bioreactors (Unit- 5 : Dechloromonas (14. 96 %), Acinetobacter (6. 3 %), Zoogloea (4. 72 %) in the anaerobic zone and Dechloromonas (22. 37  %) in the aerobic zone; Unit- 3 : Dechloromonas (37. 25 %) in the anaerobic zone and Dechloromonas (23. 97 %) in the aerobic zone) confirmed the phosphate-removal efficiencies of both units. Negligible GAOs were found in the aerobic zones (Defluviicoccus spp. : 0. 33 % for Unit- 5 and 0. 68 % for Unit- 3) and in the anaerobic zones (Defluviicoccus: 9. 8 % for Unit- 3). The high microbial diversity and a negligible percentage of GAOs in Unit- 5 could contribute to its high phosphate-removal efficiency, although results did not indicate statistically significant differences between the unit with a covered elutriation tank (Unit- 5) and that with open elutriation tanks (Unit- 3) ...|$|E

5|$|Brain tissue consumes a {{large amount}} of energy in {{proportion}} to its volume, so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals. The need to limit body weight in order, for example, to fly, has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species, such as bats. Most of the brain's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge (membrane potential) of neurons. Most vertebrate species devote between 2% and 8% of basal metabolism to the brain. In primates, however, the percentage is much higher—in humans it rises to 20–25%. The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET, fMRI, and NIRS. The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen-dependent metabolism of glucose (i.e., blood sugar), but ketones provide a major alternative source, together with contributions from medium chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (caprylic and <b>heptanoic</b> <b>acids),</b> lactate, acetate, and possibly amino acids.|$|R

National Air Emissions Monitoring Study (NAEMS). The overall goal of the project was to establish odor and chemical emission factors for animal feeding operations. The study was conducted over a 17 -month period at two freestall dairies, one swine sow farm, and one swine finisher facility. Samples from a representative exhaust airstream at each barn were collected in 10 L Tedlar bags and analyzed by trained human panelists using dynamic triangular forced-choice olfactometry. Samples were simultaneously analyzed for 20 odorous compounds (acetic acid, propanoic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, valeric acid, isovaleric <b>acid,</b> hexanoic <b>acid,</b> <b>heptanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> guaiacol, phenol, 4 -methylphenol, 4 -ethylphenol, 2 -aminoacetophenone, indole, skatole, dimethyl disulfide, diethyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, hydrogen sulfide, and ammonia). In this article, which is part 6 of a six-part series summarizing results of the project, we investigate the correlations between odor concentrations and odor activity value (OAV), defined as the concentration of a single compound divided by the odor threshold for that compound. The specific objectives were to determine which compounds contributed most to the overall odor emanating from swine and dairy buildings, and develop equations for predicting odor concentration based on compound OAVs. Single-compound odor thresholds (SCOT) were statistically summarized and analyzed, and OAVs were calculated for all compounds. Odor concentrations were regressed against OAV values using multivariate regression techniques. Both swine sites had four common compounds with the highest OAVs (ranked high to low: hydrogen sulfide, 4 -methylphenol, butyric acid, isovaleric acid). The dairy sites had these same four compounds in common in the top five, and in addition diethyl disulfide was ranked second at one dairy site, while ammonia was ranked third at the other dairy site. Summed OAVs were not a good predictor of odor concentration (R 2 = 0. 16 to 0. 52), underestimating actual odor concentrations by 2 to 3 times. Based on the OAV and regression analyses, we conclude that hydrogen sulfide, 4 -methylphenol, isovaleric acid, ammonia, and diethyl disulfide are the most likely contributors to swine odor, while hydrogen sulfide, 4 -methyl phenol, butyric acid, and isovaleric acid are the most likely contributors to dairy odors...|$|R

Some industrially utilised chemicals such as cyclohexane, nonene, <b>heptanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> decanoic acid and limonene were produced through the pyrolysis of RSO. The products obtained in the pyrolysis of RSO were similar to that of soybean oil and the range of products was found to be notably wider than the range of products obtained in the pyrolysis of several other fatty oils such as castor oil, palm tree oil and canola oil. The acidity and density of the distillates were found to increase with the distillation temperature. The thermal cleavage of triglycerides (TG) into free <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (FFA) became significant above 150  °C and the end point of ester bonds in triglycerides was found to be at a temperature around 275  °C. The findings of this paper encourage future {{research in the area of}} pyrolysis as a renewable source for petrochemicals since currently we are currently within the declining phase of using crude oil.|$|R

The mixed carbon sources {{consisted of}} <b>heptanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (HA) and oleic acid (OA). A relatively low PHA content at 1. 2 % (w/w) and 11. 4 % (w/w) was obtained when HA or OA {{was used as}} the sole carbon source. When these <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were supplied as a mixture, PHA content increased threefold. Interestingly, the mixture-derived PHA composed of both odd and even monomer units, namely. 3 -hydroxyheptanoate, 3 -hydroxyoctanoate, 3 -hydroxydecanoate, and 3 -hydroxydodecanoate and no unsaturated monomer was detected. It is hypothesized that the even-numbered monomers were derived primarily from OA, whereas the odd-numbered monomer was derived from HA. This also points out to an efficient and yet distinct <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> metabolism that fed the PHA biosynthesis machinery of this particular microorganism. PHA obtained was elastomeric because melting temperature (Tm) and crystallinity were absent.

40|$|This {{study was}} an add-on study to the National Air Emission Monitoring Study (NAEMS). The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to measure odor emissions and corresponding concentrations and emissions of target odorous gases. Odor and odorous gas measurements at four NAEMS sites (dairy barns in Wisconsin-WI 5 B and Indiana-IN 5 B, swine finisher barn in Indiana-IN 3 B and swine gestation/farrowing barns in Iowa-IA 4 B) were conducted during four- 13 weeks periods over 1 year. Odorous gas samples were collected every two weeks using sorbent tubes and analyzed by the automated one-step thermal desorption-GC-MS-Olfactometry. In this paper, we summarize measured concentrations and emissions of 15 odorous gases from four sites. The average volatile <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (VFAs) concentrations ranged between 1. 1 and 121 µg m - 3. The average phenolics and indolics concentrations varied from 0. 03 to 42 µg m - 3. The total volatile organic compound VOC emission rates for 15 compounds for four sites ranged between 8. 89 and 546 mg/hr-m 2. Only acetic acid (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) and propanoic acid (p 3 ̆c 0. 1) had a seasonal significant difference for IA 4 B. For IN 3 B, 4 -ethyl phenol and indole and most of VFAs (except hexanoic and <b>heptanoic</b> <b>acid)</b> have the seasonal significant differences. At the WI 5 B dairy site, there were five VFAs (acetic, propanoic, 2 -methyl propanoic, butyric and 3 -methylbuanoic acid) and one phenolics (4 -methyl phenol) showing a seasonal significant difference. Only three compounds (2 -methoxyphenol, 1 -(2 -aminophenyl) -ethanone and indole) had a seasonal significant difference for IN 5 B. Between dairy sites (WI 5 B vs. IN 5 B), acetic, propanoic, 2 -methyl propanoic, butyric, and 3 -methyl butanoic acids were significantly different. Most of odorants were significantly different except <b>heptanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> 1 -(2 -aminophenyl) -ethanone and 3 -methyl indole, between the two swine sites (IA 4 B vs. IN 3 B).

40|$|A Pseudomonas sp. {{strain that}} {{is capable of}} {{utilizing}} dicarboxylic acids as a sole carbon source was isolated from activated sludge by using the enrichment culture technique. This organism accumulated polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) with an unusual pattern of monomer units that depends on the carbon sources used. Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) homopolyester was synthesized from glucose or small C(-even) alkanoic acids, such as butyric acid and hexanoic acid. Accumulation of PHB homopolyester was also observed in the cells grown on C(-odd) dicarboxylic acids, such as heptanedioic acid and nonanedioic acid as the sole carbon sources. In contrast, a copolyester consisting of 6 mol% 3 -hydroxybutyrate (3 HB) and 94 mol% 3 -hydroxyvalerate (3 HV) was produced with a PHA content of as much as 36 % of the cellular dry matter. This strain produced PHAs consisting both of the short-chain-length (SCL) and the medium- chain-length (MCL) 3 -hydroxyacid units when <b>heptanoic</b> <b>acid</b> to undecanoic acid were fed as the sole carbon sources. Most interestingly, polyester consisting of significant amount of relevant fractions, 3 HB, 3 HV, and 3 - hydroxyheptanoate (3 HHp), was accumulated from <b>heptanoic</b> <b>acid.</b> According to solvent fractionation experiments, the polymer produced from <b>heptanoic</b> <b>acid</b> was a blend of poly(3 HHp) and of a copolyester of 3 HB, 3 HV, and 3 HHp units. The hexane soluble fractions contained only 3 HHp units while the hexane- insoluble fractions contained 3 HB and 3 HV units {{with a small amount of}} 3 HHp unit. The copolyester was an elastomer with unusual mechanical properties. The maximum elongation ratio of the copolyester was 460 % with an ultimate strength of 10 MPa, which was very different from those of poly(3 HB-co- 3 HV) copolyesters having similar compositions produced from other microorganisms. ope...|$|R
