50|$|Stenusin is biosynthesized in the pygidial glands of Stenus Latreille, {{located in}} the last three {{segments}} of the beetles' abdomen. This molecule is the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>product</b> of several reactions that utilize L-lysine, L-isoleucine, and an acetate source. First, both L-lysine and L-isoleucine undergo separate decarboxylation reactions followed by oxidative deamination. The product created from L-lysine undergoes intramolecular Schiff base formation to create the piperidine ring found in stenusin. The two amino acid products then combine through a Stork enamine alkylation reaction and are further acylated and reduced to form stenusin.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} {{mutations}} in the TYMP gene {{have been discovered}} {{that lead to the}} onset of mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome. The TYMP gene is a nuclear gene, however, mutations in the TYMP gene affect mitochrondrial DNA and function. Mutations in this gene result in a loss of thymidine phosphorylase activity. Thymidine phosphorylase is the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>product</b> of the TYMP gene and is responsible for breaking down thymidine nucleosides into thymine and 2-deoxyribose 1-phosphate. Without normal thymidine phosphorylase activity, thymidine nucleosides begin to build up in cells. High nucleoside levels are toxic to mitochondrial DNA and cause mutations that lead to dysfunction of the respiratory chain, and thus, inadequate energy production in the cells. These mitochondrial effects are responsible for the symptomatology associated with the disease.|$|E

Three products were observed from the reactions catalyzed by TIM: GAP from isomerization with intramolecular transfer of hydrogen (18 % of the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>products),</b> d-GAP from isomerization with incorporation of deuterium from D 2 O into C- 2 of GAP (43 % of the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>products),</b> and [1 (R) - 2 H]-DHAP (d-DHAP) from incorporation of deuterium from D 2 O into C- 1 of DHAP (40 % of the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>products).</b> The ratios of the yields of the deuterium-labeled products d-DHAP and d-GAP from partitioning of the intermediate of the TIM-catalyzed reactions of GAP and DHAP in D 2 O are 1. 48 and 0. 93, respectively. This provides evidence that the reaction of these two substrates does not proceed through a single, common, reaction intermediate but, rather, through distinct intermediates that differ in the bonding and arrangement of catalytic residues at the enediolate O- 1 and O- 2 oxyanions formed on deprotonation of GAP and DHAP, respectively...|$|R

High-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) of this derivative yielded a sharp peak with a retention time of 7. 99 min corresponding to the authentic compound. The enzyme blank and boiled enzyme blank failed to show any significant HPLC peaks corresponding to retinal O-ethyloxime, retinal, or retinol. (ii) The mass spectrum of the O-ethyloxime of the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>product</b> was identical to that of authentic retinal O-ethyloxime (m/z 327 : 45 %, M+. and m/z 282 : 100 %, M [...] ethoxy).

Three products were observed from the reactions catalyzed by TIM: dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) from isomerization with intramolecular transfer of hydrogen (49 % of the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>products),</b> [1 (R) - 2 H]-DHAP from isomerization with incorporation of deuterium from D 2 O into C- 1 of DHAP (31 % of the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>products),</b> and [2 (R) - 2 H]-GAP from incorporation of deuterium from D 2 O into C- 2 of GAP (21 % of the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>products).</b> The similar yields of [1 (R) - 2 H]-DHAP and [2 (R) - 2 H]-GAP from partitioning of the enzyme-bound enediol(ate) intermediate between hydron transfer to C- 1 and C- 2 is consistent with earlier results, which showed that there are similar barriers for conversion of this intermediate to the -hydroxy ketone and aldehyde products (Knowles, J.

However, the observation that the TIM-catalyzed isomerization of GAP in D 2 O proceeds with 49 % intramolecular transfer of the 1 H label from substrate to product DHAP stands in sharp contrast with the 6 % intramolecular transfer of the 3 H label from substrate to product GAP reported for the TIM-catalyzed reaction of [1 (R) - 3 H]-DHAP in H 2 O (Herlihy, J.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the reaction between the yeast materials derived from Candida utilis (CU) and different enzymes, and to evaluate their interaction on physical pellet quality. In order to evaluate the effect of different enzymes on Candida utilis, three kinds of <b>enzymatic</b> <b>products</b> were used, to compare the influence of each enzyme on CU. Used <b>enzymatic</b> <b>products</b> were protease, endo/exo 1. 3 -beta-glucanase, and the mixture between those two products. A number of physical pellet quality parameters were analyzed to determine the enzymatic influence on hardness, underwater pellet swelling rate (UPS rate), moisture content, water activity (Aw), surface contact angle with water/oil. Ten diets were formulated with three different enzymatic dosages: the optimal dosage recommended by the producer, ten folds higher dosage and hundred folds higher dosage. Among three <b>enzymatic</b> <b>products,</b> the protease showed indication to influence changes on pellet quality when compared to endo/exo 1. 3 -beta-glucanase, mixture of protease and endo/exo 1. 3 -beta-glucanase.

40|$|A {{proper balance}} between {{saturated}} and unsaturated fatty acids (FAs) {{is required for}} maintaining cell homeostasis. The increased demand of FAs to assemble the plasma membranes of continuously dividing cancer cells might unbalance this ratio and critically affect tumour outgrowth. We unveiled {{the role of the}} stearoyl-CoA desaturase SCD 5 in converting saturated FAs into mono-unsaturated FAs during melanoma progression. SCD 5 is down-regulated in advanced melanoma and its restored expression significantly reduced melanoma malignancy, both in vitro and in vivo, through a mechanism governing the secretion of extracellular matrix proteins, such as secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) and collagen IV and of their proteases, such as cathepsin B. Enforced expression of SCD 5 or supplementation of its <b>enzymatic</b> <b>product,</b> oleic acid, reduced the intracellular pH (pHe > pHi) and, in turn, vesicular trafficking across plasma membranes as well as melanoma dissemination. This intracellular acidification appears also to depend on SCD 5 -induced reduction of the C 2 subunit of the vacuolar H + -ATPase, a proton pump whose inhibition changes the secretion profile of cancer cells. Our data support a role for SCD 5 and its <b>enzymatic</b> <b>product,</b> oleic acid, in protection against malignancy, offering an explanation for the beneficial Mediterranean diet.

Final <b>enzymatic</b> <b>product,</b> 4 -methylumbelliferone, obtained after adding exogenous beta-galactosidase, was quantified by LC/MRM-MS (liquid-chromatography/multiple-reaction-monitoring mass-spectrometry). 4 -propyl- 5 -hydroxy- 7 -methyl- 2 h-chromen- 2 -one was used as internal standard, a compound with a similar molecular structure and fragmentation pattern in negative ion mode as 4 -methylumbelliferone. The enzymatic assay yielded a positive and negative predictive value of 1. 0 for genetically confirmed MPS IVA patients (GALNS activity of 0. 35 ± 0. 21 μmol/L/h) and for controls with normal GALNS activity (23. 1 ± 5. 3 μmol/L /h).
