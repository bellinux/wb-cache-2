He was assigned to Abwehrstelle II Commando VIII, based in Breslau. He later told Czech police that he <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> he needed the money; by this time Schindler had a drinking problem and was chronically in debt.|$|E

Edward agrees, but when he picks the lock, a burglar alarm is triggered. Jim flees and Edward is arrested.

Edward takes responsibility for the robbery, telling a surprised Kim he <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> she asked him to. Edward is shunned by the neighborhood except for the Boggs.|$|E

25|$|When Marissa {{finds out}} about Bianca helping JR {{with trying to}} win her back, she asks Bianca about. Bianca tells Marissa she <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> Bianca could not do all those things for Marissa herself. Another reason was because it looked like Marissa was {{falling in love with}} JR again and because it seemed like JR had changed. Marissa accuses Bianca of {{manipulating}} her and the situation. Bianca suggests that they should not see each other for a while and Marissa agrees.|$|E

In the documentary The Lesser Lights of Heaven, the band disavowed the re-recording, admitting they <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> they were broke and needed to fulfill their record contract with Solid State, even though {{it turned out to be}} a solid release.|$|E
25|$|Lizzie also ends {{up going}} against her brother Charley's wishes, when {{she refuses to}} marry Bradley Headstone. He {{would have been an}} {{excellent}} match for her, according to norms of the time, however, Lizzie does not love him. She unselfishly does what others expect of her, doing things like helping Charley escape their father to go to school, and living with Jenny Wren. Marrying Wrayburn is the only truly selfish act Lizzie commits in Our Mutual Friend, and even that is debatable, since she only <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> Wrayburn appeared to be on his deathbed.|$|E

500|$|ActionAid, {{a charity}} which co-ordinates a schools {{programme}} with 10:10, approved {{the decision to}} withdraw the film, and stated [...] "Our job is to encourage proactive decisions at class level to reduce carbon emissions.

So we think the 10:10 campaign is very important, but the moment this film was seen it was clear it was inappropriate." ...|$|E

Wesley doesn’t want to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> he is making the door and Emma doesn’t want to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> she is remaking her posters. Wesley says that Emma doesn’t want to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> just <b>because</b> she’s “on the rag”, so she throws down her markers and gets up to add the water.|$|R
500|$|Casablanca {{was part}} of the film {{colorization}} controversy of the 1980s, when a colorized version aired on the television network WTBS. In 1984, MGM/UA hired Color Systems Technology to colorize the film for $180,000. When Ted Turner of Turner Broadcasting System purchased MGM/UA's film library two years later, he canceled the request, before contracting American Film Technologies (AFT) in 1988. AFT completed the colorization in two months at a cost of $450,000. Turner later reacted to the criticism of the colorization, saying, [...] " [...] {{is one of a handful}} of films that really doesn't have to be colorized. I <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> I wanted to. All I'm trying to do is protect my investment." ...|$|E

[...] Another photo had been slated for the album cover, but the band found a swamp and acted on their manager's idea. [...] "We went down there, took off our shoes, rolled up our jeans a little bit and walked right into the water—and stood there for 45 minutes while we got our picture taken. It's a good thing we <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> when we got the pictures back, those were by far our favorite!" [...] said Bunn.|$|E

Michael calms her down, telling her the reality is they both quit and that their only option is to continue trying with the new company. Michael purchases office space in the Scranton Business Park, where Dunder Mifflin is located; {{it turns out to be}} a large closet directly underneath the Dunder Mifflin office. Michael and Pam put their company name in the office lobby directory where they encounter Charles.

500|$|According to actress Marley Shelton, [...] "Rodriguez and Tarantino really co-directed, {{at least}} Planet Terror. Quentin was on set a lot. He had notes and {{adjustments}} to our performances and he changed lines {{every once in}} a while. Of course, he always deferred to Robert on Planet Terror and vice versa for Death Proof. So it's really both of their brainchild." [...] Tarantino has stated, [...] "I can't imagine doing Grindhouse with any other director in the way me and Robert <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> I just had complete faith and trust in him. So much so that we didn't actually see each other's movie completed until three weeks before the film opened. It was as if we worked in little vacuums and cut our movies down, and then put them together and watched it all play, and then made a couple of little changes after that, and pretty much that was it." ...|$|E
500|$|Of his {{approach}} to directing the film, Lane explains, [...] "Thunderbirds Are Go was done like an episode but on a bigger scale. Whereas we would think {{that it might be}} nice to do a particular shot on the series but couldn't afford to, with Thunderbirds Are Go we just <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> we had the money." [...] For the Swinging Star hall sequence, all the visual elements except Alan and Lady Penelope are displayed in black and white, with background characters appearing in the form of enlarged still photographs. On the surrealism of the Swinging Star scenes, aspects of which include pink space clouds made of dry ice and a giant guitar on which Cliff Richard and The Shadows perform part of [...] "Shooting Star", Anderson explains that the production team [...] "recreated a Busby Berkeley sequence", and that the appearance of puppet versions of real-life celebrities boosted the publicity value of the film.|$|E

Miranda, Annemarie, and Colin discover a Fred Flintstone bank in the back of sandwich shop. Colin, wanting {{to see more of the}} bank, is pulled way by Annemarie insisting that Jimmy could find them. The next day, Jimmy fires the three workers, thinking that one of them stole the Flintstone bank, when it was actually the laughing man who stole it. The workers write a card, give it to Jimmy and insist that they did not steal the bank. Jimmy believes them and let them work at the sandwich shop. He then tells them that he figured out who stole the bank. He thinks that it is Julia, a classmate in their class, and a best friend to Annemarie. He [...] thinks she <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> she is African American. This upsets Annemarie greatly and she immediately quits her job.|$|E
60|$|In {{summer we}} poor creatures have a respite, and may clothe {{ourselves}} in white garments; loose, soft, {{and in some}} degree shapely; but in the winter--the sombre winter, the depressing winter, the cheerless winter, when white clothes and bright colors are especially needed to brighten our spirits and lift them up--we all conform to the prevailing insanity, and go about in dreary black, each man <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> the others <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> and not <b>because</b> he wants to.

500|$|After {{the casting}} call was issued, there was brief {{speculation}} that the character was a recast for Chance Chancellor, {{who was also a}} war veteran. Later, Burton's name was attached to the role. During an appearance on The Talk the following January, Burton officially confirmed that he was cast as Dylan. The episode of The Talk was described as [...] "phenomenal"; Burton had no idea it would have been [...] "New Year's Eve kinda crazy." [...] After one of the show's co-hosts Julie Chen made the announcement of his casting and welcomed Burton to the CBS family, confetti dropped while another co-host Sheryl Underwood did a [...] "wild happy dance". Burton said, [...] "I had no idea about the CBS badge or the welcome basket, or anything. [...] That’s not how I think. I understood why CBS <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> it’s a big deal. I get it. It’s so strange for me, because I have never been one for all this publicity. They have been so gracious to me, and it was so overwhelming that they would do something like that." [...] Burton made his first on-screen appearance during the episode dated January 29, 2013. He attributed much of his success going back to the 1990s when he studied acting at Theater Theater in Hollywood, California, coached by Chris Aable.|$|E
