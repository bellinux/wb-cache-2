Factors that may cause variation include partial pressure of <b>oxygen,</b> <b>altitude,</b> humidity, and amount of time required for ignition.

Predictions of the likely physiological response of the cornea to contact lens wear can be facilitated by developing models of the oxygen performance characteristics of lenses. An <b>equivalent</b> <b>oxygen</b> technique was modified {{for use in the}} in vivo human eye; this technique involved equating the corneal oxygen demand following contact lens wear to the demand following exposure to known oxygen levels. A human eye model relating static <b>equivalent</b> <b>oxygen</b> percentages (EOP) to lens oxygen transmissibility (Dk/L) was derived using five hydrogel contact lenses; the discrepancies between this and other models could be explained by the differing criteria upon which the were based. The effect of blinking on the EOP beneath hydrogel lenses was found to be minimal, confirming earlier findings. Attempts to derive an EOP v Dk/L model for hydrogel lenses wear under closed eye conditions were unsuccessful; individual variations in the supply of oxygen to the cornea under these conditions were thought to contribute to this failure. The validity of similar models was questioned in view of the simplified assumptions which were made...|$|R

Forty-three overweight women with matched anthropometric characteristics were randomly assigned to participate in: (1) HIIT [4 x 4 -minute running at 85 – 95 % HRpeak, 10 -minute recovery], (2) MICT [33 -minute running at 60 – 70 % HRpeak] with <b>oxygen</b> cost <b>equivalent</b> to HIIT, and (3) no training [control], for 12 weeks, 4 d·wk- 1. Dietary energy intake and habitual energy expenditure were not altered during the intervention. After the intervention, whole-body fat reduction and serum lipid profile modification were similar in the HIIT and MICT groups. With regard to the abdominal visceral (AVFA) and subcutaneous (ASFA) fat areas revealed by computed tomography scans, a greater reduction in ASFA was found in the HIIT than in the MICT group (p=. 038). Moreover, a significant reduction in AVFA was found only in the HIIT group. No variables were changed in the control group. Twelve-week HIIT and MICT programmes with <b>equivalent</b> <b>oxygen</b> cost resulted in similar whole-body fat loss in overweight women. Nonetheless, HIIT appears to be more effective than MICT for controlling abdominal visceral and subcutaneous fat...|$|R

Whereas Hartree-Fock (HF) theory overly favors such symmetry-broken polaronic hole-localization in oxides, standard local density (LD) calculations suffer from spurious delocalization among several oxygen sites. These opposite biases originate from the opposite curvatures of the energy {{as a function of}} the fractional occupation number n, i. e., d 2 E/dn 2 0 in LD. We recover the correct linear behavior, d 2 E/dn 2 = 0, that removes the (de) localization bias by formulating a generalized Koopmans condition.

This paper evaluates how material flammability performance is impacted from both the Maximum Oxygen Concentration (MOC) and Maximum Total Pressures (MTP) perspectives. From these studies, oxygen partial pressures can be compared for both the MOC and MTP methods to determine the role of partial pressure in material flammability.

30|$|For {{scaling up}} the culture volume, the {{cultivation}} setup at pH 7, induction with 1  mM IPTG and with addition of 3 % EtOH {{was used for}} the d-Hyd(co). Since this cultivation setup was investigated for a 1  mL culture in a 48 -well flowerplate at 600  rpm shaking frequency and 37  °C, it needed to be scaled up by keeping the oxygen transfer rate constant. Baumann et al. reported that 1  mL filling volume at 600  rpm in a flower plate corresponds to a kLa value of 88.9 /h. For a 2.5 L baffled Tunair shake flask with 800  mL filling volume, they determined an incubator shaking speed of 180  rpm for <b>equivalent</b> <b>oxygen</b> uptake (Baumann et al. 2015). Based on these results, 1  L shaking flasks were filled up to 200  mL and shaken at 120  rpm to achieve a similar oxygen transfer rate.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} whether tear mixing occurs beneath soft contact lenses, {{we examined the}} effect of blinking on the oxygen distribution across the corneal surface beneath a nonuniform thickness lens. METHODS: A custom-designed twin polarographic oxygen sensor assembly was used to simultaneously measure the <b>equivalent</b> <b>oxygen</b> percentage (EOP) at central and peripheral corneal locations of 10 human subjects beneath a - 6. 00 D thin-design hydroxyethyl mathacrylate (HEMA) lens. A - 0. 25 D lens served as a control. Each lens was worn for 5 min under static (no blinking) and dynamic (12 and 60 blinks/min) conditions. RESULTS: A significantly greater EOP (p = 0. 006) was observed at the central (vs. peripheral) cornea during static and dynamic lens wear; central and peripheral oxygenation were unaffected by blinking. CONCLUSIONS: Tear mixing is insignificant beneath thin-design HEMA lenses; therefore, oxygenation across the corneal surface beneath such lenses is best predicted from the lens thickness profile rather than average thickness...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Effects of {{increased}} ambient pressure on mucociliary clearance have been poorly investigated. The effects of increasing pressures on ciliary beat frequency (CBF) of guinea-pig tracheal rings were studied in vitro. Increased pressures of 25 and 100 kPa induced {{a significant and}} equivalent en-hancement of CBF from 30 min after the pressure increase. The increase in CBF observed after a pressure increase of 50 kPa (inspiratory oxygen fraction = 21 %), was significantly greater than that observed with an <b>equivalent</b> <b>oxygen</b> tension at atmos-pheric pressure, i. e. with a gas mixture containing 30 % oxygen. Addition of NG-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME) inhibited the enhancement in CBF observed after the 25 kPa pressure increase. Addition of L-arginine reversed the effect of L-NAME. These results demonstrate that a pressure increase applied to tracheal rings, in vitro, induces an enhancement of ciliary beat frequency and that generation of nitric oxide {{may be involved in}} this ciliary stimulation...|$|R

With this technique, the evolution of <b>equivalent</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentration fields in the liquid slugs passing through one and several bends was firstly described. In particular, it was observed how the flow structure (recirculation zones) inside the liquid slugs were twisted and split by the periodic bends (centrifugal effect), until reaching, after several bends, a uniform O- 2 concentration inside the liquid slugs. The influence of the "turning point", joining two "straight" sections of meandering channel was also highlighted: a slowing down of the gas-liquid {{mass transfer}} was clearly shown. Volumetric mass transfer coefficients were determined at last by fitting the experimental axial profiles of averaged oxygen concentrations in the liquid slugs (before the turning point) with the ones predicted by a classical plug-flow model...|$|R
40|$|The {{equilibrium}} oxygen {{chemical potential}} and the partial energy and entropy of O 2 in perovskites La 1 −xSrxCoO 3 −δwere measured {{as a function}} ofδandxby high-temperature oxygen coulometric titration. An almost linear decrease in the oxygen chemical potential is observed with increasing net electron concentration 2 δ−x. The observed behavior is interpreted to reflect the corresponding increase in the Fermi level on filling up states in a broad electron band with electrons induced by vacancy formation or reducing the Sr-dopant level. The results enable calculation of the apparent density of states at the Fermi level. For low values ofδand high temperatures, the oxygen vacancies in La 1 −xSrxCoO 3 −δare randomly distributed among <b>equivalent</b> <b>oxygen</b> sites. By increasingδor by lowering the temperature, additional ionic contributions to the partial energy and entropy arise, but these cancel in the chemical potential of oxygen vacancies.
