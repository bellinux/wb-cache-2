40|$|In human obstetrics, placental {{vascularisation}} impairment is frequent {{as well as}} {{linked to}} severe pathological events (preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction), {{and there is a}} need for reliable methods allowing non-invasive evaluation of placental blood flow. Uteroplacental vascularisation is complex, and animal models are essential for the technical development and safety assessment of these imaging tools for human clinical use; however, these techniques can also be applied in the veterinary context. This paper reviews how ultrasound-based imaging methods such as 2 D and 3 D Doppler can provide valuable insight for the exploration of placental blood flow both in humans and animals and how new approaches such as the use of ultrasound contrast agents or ultrafast Doppler may allow to discriminate between maternal (non-pulsatile) and <b>foetal</b> (pulsatile) <b>blood</b> flow in the placenta.

Tiene la ventaja de ser mínimamente invasiva y fácil de usar. La saturación de hemoglobina fetal oxigenada es un buen parámetro para medir el contenido-déficit fetal de oxígeno. Una saturación menor del 30 % durante un periodo de tiempo superior a 10 minutos se correlaciona con una pHmetría de micromuestra de cuero cabelludo fetal Pulse oximetry {{is a technique}} that continuously measures the blood oxygen saturation (%SpO 2); {{it has become a}} standard monitoring method in Anaesthesia, Intensive Care, Neonatology, etc; and it can be helpful in Obstetrics during delivery to monitor foetal welfare. Its advantages are that it is minimally invasive and easy to use. Moreover, SpO 2 is a good parameter for measuring oxygen carriage. A saturation below 30 % during a time period over 10 minutes is correlated with an acid-base equilibrium (ABE) of <b>foetal</b> scalp <b>blood</b> sample below 7. 20, and it is predictive of worse perinatal outcomes. The objectives are: 1. The combined use of both techniques (foetal pulse oximetry and ABE), provides equivalent perinatal outcomes but decreases the Caesarean Intrapartum Rate due to suspicion of a loss of foetal welfare. 2. A correlation was found between foetal pulse oximetry and acid-base equilibrium data such as pH, pO 2 and EB. Subjects and methods. Data was gathered on two groups of eighty patients. In the first group we carried out a follow up of delivery under serialized pH-metry, and in the other group, control of the foetuses was carried out in a combined form with pHmetry and pulse oximetry. Results. Statistically significant results were obtained concerning delivery in the comparative study of both groups. Following the perinatal results obtained, the data indicates that there are {{no significant differences between the}} two groups in the pH values of the umbilical artery or in the Apgar values at one and five minutes after delivery, for which reason both protocols are equally satisfactory. The correlation of the data obtained by pH-metry with those of pulse oximetry was statistically significant. Conclusions. The combined use of both techniques increases the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis of suspected loss of foetal intrapartum welness, without worsening perinatal outcomes, decreasing the Caesarean Intrapartum Rate due to pathological or non-reassuring foetal electronic monitoring.

40|$|For {{many years}} {{intermittent}} {{recording of the}} foetal heart rate with a stethoscope and the detec-tion of meconium in the liquor {{have been the only}} signs used for diagnosing intrapartum foetal asphyxia. Although the system has the virtue of simplicity, the unexpected disappearance of foetal heart sound when the foetal heart rate was being recorded as normal, or the frequent delivery of a vigorous baby when a firm diagnosis of foetal distress had been made, have served as constant reminders that more precise tools are needed. Recently, with the technical improvement in electronic recording, it has become possible to obtain a continuous record of the foetal cardiac activity. At the same time the assessment of the significance of abnormalities of the foetal heart rate has been improved by measuring the pH of <b>foetal</b> <b>blood</b> obtained by the technique of <b>foetal</b> <b>blood</b> sampling (Saling, 1962).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The first aim of {{this study}} was to assess 25 -hydroxy vitamin D (25 OHD) {{concentrations}} in women with type 1 diabetes (T 1 DM) during pregnancy, post-delivery and also <b>foetal</b> (cord <b>blood)</b> 25 OHD concentrations and to examine relationships between these. The second aim of the study was to investigate potential interactions between maternal body mass index (BMI) and foetal vitamin D status. A further study aim was to examine potential relationships between maternal 25 OHD and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c) throughout pregnancy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was an observational study of 52 pregnant controls without diabetes and 65 pregnant women with T 1 DM in a university teaching hospital. Maternal serum 25 OHD was measured serially throughout the pregnancy and post-delivery. Cord blood 25 OHD was measured at delivery. 25 OHD was measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). RESULTS: Vitamin D deficiency (25 OHD 30 kg/m(2) (nmol/L ± SD); 19. 93 ± 11. 15 vs. 13. 73 ± 4. 74, p= 0. 026].

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of a public health intervention to reduce blood mercury (Hg) concentration levels in pregnant Bermudian women. METHODS: In 2003, we conducted a study entitled "Prenatal exposure of the Bermudian Population to Environmental Contaminants" which provided Bermuda's first baseline data on prenatal exposure to several environmental contaminants, including Hg. The mean Hg concentration from 42 healthy newborns measured in umbilical cord blood was 41. 3 nmol/L, ranging from 5 - 160 nmol/L. This concentration was much higher than expected, being approximately 8 times the general levels found in Canada and the U. S. Furthermore, we estimated that 85 % of total Hg measured was {{in the form of}} methylmercury (MeHg), indicating that seafood consumption was the primary source of Hg exposure during pregnancy in Bermuda. Locally sourced seafood was identified as the most significant possible contributory source of Hg exposure. In 2005 the authors began a complementary research programme to study the levels of Hg in local commercial fish species. Coming out of this research were specific local fish consumption guidelines issued by the Department of Health advising pregnant women to avoid those local fish species found to be high in Hg while still encouraging consumption of fish species having lower Hg levels. RESULTS: In 2010, under another research initiative, we returned to Bermuda to carry out another evaluation of Hg in human blood. Hg was measured in the blood of 49 pregnant women. The arithmetic mean Hg blood concentration was 6. 6 nmol/L and the geometric mean 4. 2 nmol/L. The maximum concentration found was 24 nmol/L.

Tissue sections were stained with biotinylatedBandeiraea simplicifolia (BS- 1) lectin to allow identification of foetal capillaries, and analysed using stereological techniques. Protein restriction increased total placental volume, but decreased {{the proportion of the}} placental volume composed of labyrinth. Consequently the total volumes of labyrinthine tissue and of <b>foetal</b> and maternal <b>blood</b> space were not different between the two groups. Protein restriction increased the surface area density and total surface area of the materno-foetal interface, but did not alter foetal capillary surface area, diameter or length.

The possibilities for using intact foetal cells extracted from maternal blood for prenatal diagnosis are limited. Recently real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques have allowed the identification and quantification of foetal DNA in the maternal <b>blood.</b> <b>Foetal</b> sex determination with Y-chromosome-PCR has been found to have a specificity of 100 %. The sensitivity is 96 % but increases with gestational age, so that from 10 weeks onwards the sensitivity approaches 100 %. In the case of X-linked diseases, this technique can reduce invasive prenatal diagnosis by 50 %. In the case of a foetus with an elevated risk for congenital adrenal hyperplasia, early non-invasive foetal sexing can also shorten the period of maternal dexamethasone use so as to prevent virilisation in the female foetus. Early second trimester non-invasive foetal RhD genotyping with an RhD-PCR has a sensitivity and specificity of 100 % each.

40|$|Tolerance of the fœtal {{allograft}} by {{the maternal}} immune system in human {{is a complex}} multi-factorial mechanism. It has been strongly presumed to involve the CD 95 /CD 95 -L apoptotic system, HLA-G, IDO, ILF or the Th 1 /Th 2 balance. This last theory proposes that the shift of the Thl/Th 2 balance toward Th 2 reduces the inflammatory immune responses and so the probability of foetus rejection. A very interesting question is to know how conceptus could influence this Th 1 /Th 2 balance. Some years ago, our group has demonstrated the apparition, during pregnancy, of a different growth hormone, the placental growth hormone (hPGH = hGH-V), secreted by placenta and which progressively replaces the pituitary growth hormone (hGH-N). Could this replacement of hGH-N by hPGH exert {{an effect on the}} Th 1 /Th 2 balance, and so could this contribute to protect the conceptus against rejection ? To investigate this possibility, we couldn't perform usual FACS cell-surface marker analysis techniques because, at our knowledge, no discriminating Th 1 and Th 2 specific membrane protein exists. The only available way was to study the cytokine production pattern. So, beside cytokines's, the mRNAs production tell us about the cellular Thl/Th 2 balance status. We investigated here peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which are the maternal immune cells coming in contact to trophoblastic cells which limit <b>foetal</b> tissues. <b>Blood</b> cells were isolated from women but also from men. Specific mRNA were quantified in a multi-probe RNase Protection assay after short-term cultures. The results show that : 1. hGHs may act on cytokine mRNAs production. 2. hPGH may act differently as hGH-N. 3. men/women cell responses difference is not higher than inter-individual variations. 4. cells do not seem to respond in a clear Th 1 /Th 2 way; GHs seem to act differently accordingly to the cytokine considered. 5. high inter-individual variability exists, confirming that peripheral blood mononuclear cells, often describe as mainly quiescent cells, could possess very different immune response capabilities, certainly in correlation with the immune past of the blood donor. So hPGH appear not to act directly on the Th 1 /Th 2 balance but well on the secretion of given cytokines...|$|R

Recombinant Fc-modified antibodies have been designed as inert potential biotherapeutics to compete with maternal alloantibodies and reduce foetal mortality. Fc-modified anti-D (Fog 1 G 1 Δnab) and anti-HPA- 1 a (B 2 G 1 Δnab & B 2 G 1 Δnac) have been evaluated for their materno-foetal transport capacity using human placental models. For future in vivo efficacy, Fc-modified antibodies should transport at similar rates to wild-type antibodies (Fog 1 G 1 and B 2 G 1). The placental perfusion model showed that the Δnab mutation appeared to lower the transport capability of anti-D and anti-HPA- 1 a across the placenta. In a Human Umbilical Endothelial Vein Cell (HUVEC-c) cell culture model, transport of HPA- 1 a was favoured in a basal to apical direction and was statistically significant at hours 12 and 24 (p= 0. 002 & p= 0. 010 respectively). The relative order of transport was B 2 G 1 Δnac > B 2 G 1 > B 2 G 1 Δnab implying the Δnac mutation enhances transport across the foetal endothelium. Since approximately 40 % of RhD negative women give birth to RhD negative babies, these women currently receive anti-D prophylaxis unnecessarily. Foetal DNA was successfully extracted from maternal plasma and genotyped for foetal RhD status using Real-Time PCR.

In our case, the occlusion at the insertion of the right and middle hepatic veins, thanks to the persistence of the left hepatic vein flow probably maintained by foetal circulation, allowed the formation of a natural intrahepatic shunt from the right and middle hepatic veins to the left hepatic vein and also the presence of caval stenosis allowed formation of paracaval azygos and hemiazygos hypertrophy. The absence of this natural shunt could explain the high rate of mortality due to diaphragmatic hernia in foetal life when the liver is involved, but also in perinatal life during which occlusion of the umbilical vein and Arantius ligamentum could cause retracting fibrosis at its insertion in the left hepatic vein with consequent occlusion or stenosis. Moreover, the high rate of mortality in the operated foetus with liver involvement could be explained in the rotation manoeuvre of the liver in the abdomen. In fact, this could cause a caval stenosis with two possible consequences: complete caval occlusion under the origin of hepatic vein and interruption of caval flow that could be compensated by persistence of the partial caval lumen or extracaval venous system (azygos and hemiazygos) if present or direct occlusion at the origin of one or more hepatic veins with consequent liver congestion and also occlusion of the transhepatic umbilical flow at the insertion of the Arantius ligamentum venosum at the left hepatic vein.|$|R

Arterial blood gases, continuous monitoring of maternal and foetal heart rates and blood pressures were performed in chronically catheterized pregnant ewes. <b>Foetal</b> <b>blood</b> flows and vascular resistance were determined with radioactive microspheres. SQ- 29, 548 effectively blocked the expected vasoconstrictive effects of thromboxane. However, prolonged infusion of SQ- 29, 548 resulted in significant decreases in umbilical–placental blood flow and foetal mean arterial pressure. This {{was accompanied by a}} respiratory acidemia. Potential therapy for the vasoconstrictive disorders of pregnancy with SQ- 29, 548 awaits further investigation of its intrinsic vasoactive properties in the umbilical–placental vasculature...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: leaves 132 - 155. Women during {{pregnancy}} in holoendemic regions of malaria {{are at an}} increased risk for peripheral malaria infections with potential for developing placental malaria. The immunological basis of protection and pathogenesis are incompletely understood. This thesis investigates both processes. Research on maternal placental immune responses necessitates the collection of reliable placental intervillous blood; an appropriate method for placental blood collection was therefore ﬁrst determined. Five documented methods of collection (perfusion, incision, biopsy, tissue grinding and prick) were compared for <b>foetal</b> <b>blood</b> contamination and mononuclear cell profiles using ﬂow cytometry. Placental blood collection by prick was established as the most appropriate method and was subsequently used for further immunological investigations...|$|E
40|$|The {{acid-base balance}} in 307 Chinese {{patients}} in labour was studied in Tsan Yuk Hospital, Hong Kong over a 15 -month period. Fifty-six {{of these were}} normal cases, 200 cases exhibited clinical signs of foetal distress and the other fifty-one were high risk cases. The results showed that cases of clinical foetal distress had a significantly lower foetal pH than that in the normal control group. Of the different signs of clinical foetal distress, meconium was the least important and foetal tachycardia appeared to be more significant than the others. Cases of postmaturity and uterine inertia also gave a lower foetal pH than normal. It is concluded that <b>foetal</b> <b>blood</b> sampling is indicated in these types of cases...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The HELLP {{syndrome}} {{is a serious}} complication in pregnancy characterized by haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count occurring in 0. 5 to 0. 9 % of all pregnancies and in 10 – 20 % of cases with severe preeclampsia. The present review highlights occurrence, diagnosis, complications, surveillance, corticosteroid treatment, mode of delivery and risk of recurrence. Methods Clinical reports and reviews published between 2000 and 2008 were screened using Pub Med and Cochrane databases. Results and conclusion About 70 % of the cases develop before delivery, the majority between the 27 th and 37 th gestational weeks; the remainder within 48 hours after delivery. The HELLP syndrome may be complete or incomplete. In the Tennessee Classification System diagnostic criteria for HELLP are haemolysis with increased LDH (> 600 U/L), AST (≥ 70 U/L), and platelets 9 /L. The Mississippi Triple-class HELLP System further classifies the disorder by the nadir platelet counts. The {{syndrome is}} a progressive condition and serious complications are frequent. Conservative treatment (≥ 48 hours) is controversial but may be considered in selected cases < 34 weeks' gestation. Delivery is indicated if the HELLP syndrome occurs after the 34 th gestational week or the foetal and/or maternal conditions deteriorate. Vaginal delivery is preferable. If the cervix is unfavourable, {{it is reasonable to}} induce cervical ripening and then labour. In gestational ages between 24 and 34 weeks most authors prefer a single course of corticosteroid therapy for foetal lung maturation, either 2 doses of 12 mg betamethasone 24 hours apart or 6 mg or dexamethasone 12 hours apart before delivery. Standard corticosteroid treatment is, however, of uncertain clinical value in the maternal HELLP syndrome. High-dose treatment and repeated doses should be avoided for fear of long-term adverse effects on the foetal brain. Before 34 weeks' gestation, delivery should be performed if the maternal condition worsens or signs of intrauterine <b>foetal</b> distress occur. <b>Blood</b> pressure should be kept below 155 / 105 mmHg. Close surveillance of the mother should be continued for at least 48 hours after delivery. </p...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. More recently, {{the regions}} of {{increased}} abdominal echogenicity such as echogenic bowel, meconium ileus and meconium peritonitis {{have been associated with}} an increased prevalence of a variety of unfavourable outcomes including chromosomal abnormalities, cytomegalovirus infection, intestinal obstruction, anorectal malformations and cystic fibrosis. Earlier prenatal examinations of these severe autosomal recessive diseases had been suggested only to families with history of cystic fibrosis. Recently, systemic examination has been introduced by ultrasound with bowel hyperechogenicity where the fetus is the index case for genetic disease. Risk for cystic fibrosis with this ultrasonography findings ranges from 0 - 33 %. Outline of Cases. Two patients are presented, aged 24 and 29 years, both primigravide. The first one had ultrasonography finding of meconium peritonitis revealed at the 37 th week of gestation and the other meconium ileus revealed on ultrasonography at the 29 th week of gestation. Both patients had prenatal testing of <b>foetal</b> <b>blood</b> obtained by cordocenthesis, both had normal kariotype and were negative for cytomegalovirus infection. Parental DNA testing for the 2 nd patient showed that parents were not carriers for the 29 most frequent mutations. Both neonates had intestinal obstruction, underwent surgery and early postoperative course was normal. Hystopathological finding suggested a possibility of cystic fibrosis for the 1 st patient, but parents {{did not want to be}} tested and for the 2 nd one congenital bowel stenosis as a cause of intestinal obstruction. Conclusion. Ultrasonographic echogenic bowel is an indication for invasive procedures for <b>foetal</b> <b>blood</b> testing for chromosomal abnormalities, congenital infections and parental testing for cystic fibrosis. Only if parental heterozygosity is proven foetus should be tested...|$|E
40|$|It is by {{now well}} {{established}} that the frequencies of ABO mating types among {{parents of children with}} Rh haemolytic disease of the newborn {{are not the same as}} in the general population. There is a reduced frequency of matings in which the mother has antibodies to ABO-antigens possessed by her husband. It is possible that incompatible <b>foetal</b> <b>blood</b> escaping into the mother's circulation is so rapidly destroyed that its ability either to sensitize or later to immunize the mother against Rh substance is impaired. Nevanlinna and Vainio (1956) have also shown that within affected families the proportion of healthy children who are incompatible withthemother for the ABO groups is even lower than the proportion of affected ones.
