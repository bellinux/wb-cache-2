40|$|Over many centuries, human {{societies}} {{across the globe}} have established progressively closer contacts. Recently, the pace of global integration has dramatically increased. Unprecedented changes in communications, transportation, and computer technology have given the process new impetus and made the world more interdependent than ever. Multinational corporations manufacture products in many countries and sell to consumers around the world. Money, technology and raw materials move ever more swiftly across national borders.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{globalisation}} is complex. It involves trade, the media, the state, technology, <b>finances</b> <b>ideas</b> and it significantly {{impacts on the}} community and the individual. A number of authors have explored how globalisation operates to bring some understanding of its processes. For example, Wallerstein discusses the notion of a 'World System' in which everything must insert and assert itself within a single division of labour. Wallerstein maintains that there is a centre and a perophery where those at the centre hold a relationship of exploitation to those in the periphery (Wallerstein 1990). 'Glocalisation' refers to the coming together of local cultures whose content has to be redefined when local cultures encounter the forces of globalisation. It is the process of a world-wide restratification, in the course of which a new socio-cultural hierarchy, on a world-wide scale is put together (Beck 2000, Bauman 1998 a). Finally, Appadurai's theorization of different 'scapes', sheds much light on the way we can reconceptualize globalisation as operating through landscape of people, <b>ideas,</b> <b>finance,</b> technology and the media (Appadurai 1990) ...|$|R

Most countries do not have special legislation governing crowdfunding but some countries like the United States, Italy, France, the United Kingdom and Germany have amended their legislation with provisions specifically designed for crowdfunding. The first aim of this research was to examine which existing legislation could be applied to crowdfunding as well as to review whether there is a need in the Croatian system to introduce new legislation designed specifically for crowdfunding issues. The second research aim was to compare crowdfunding with other sources of financing in order to decide whether it can represent a substitute for them or only a possible complementary instrument...|$|R

40|$|The U. S. {{real estate}} capital {{markets and the}} {{industry}} itself have been profoundly affected by the proliferation of public companies. But, {{by the end of}} 1999, Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) FFO multiples had been shrinking {{for more than two years}} in a row, and the REIT revolution had stalled. Before 1992, the real estate industry was entrepreneurial and financed predominantly by non-recourse debt, the major result of which has been the focus on cash flow rather than on income. The most significant consequence of the real estate industry’s dependence on debt has been a boom-and-bust pattern. The industry has also been more dependent on project financing as opposed to corporate financing. The debate over the right financing strategy for REITS remains unsettled, as corporate <b>finance</b> <b>ideas</b> that are commonplace in other industries collide with traditional thinking among real estate practitioners. Getting the right number for depreciation has been an issue and the real estate industry, unlike any other, continues to use a measure of earnings not easily subject to audit. Two alternative scenarios for the future are suggested, representing the extremes of what might happen if public capital continues to increase in importance, or if its importance diminishes. ...|$|R

Some general observations from the hard data above and the soft data generated from classroom discussions: 1) Classification into sub-topics is even more difficult than last year. There are more papers published which are not only intra-discipline but also inter-disciplinary. Law and finance is the hottest inter-disciplinary topic. Papers on the crisis are trending down. 2) The ratio between empirical to theory remains steady at 4 : 1. Theory is trending up in corporate finance, but trending down in asset pricing. 3) In corporate finance, the dominance of the old chestnuts – capital structure and corporate governance – is trending up. 4) In asset pricing, the analysis of pricing of specific assets is trending up. 5) In investments, the number of hedge fund papers is increasing. 6) The death of market microstructure has been exaggerated. Liquidity remains popular. 7) There is a small but steady fraction of banking papers published. 8) Finance journals dominate. Amongst finance journals, JF has regained its position as No 1. 9) Top non-finance journals publish many finance papers. With the notable exception of QJE, these journals have similar impact factors as the top 3 finance journals...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a theoretical model of how openness to international financial flows affects income volatility in developing countries. The underlying {{hypothesis is that}} the integration into world financial markets can have different implications for income volatility in developing and industrialized countries. This proposition is formed as an open-economy extension of the “financial accelerator ” hypothesis based on the agency cost of external <b>financing.</b> The <b>idea</b> is that the agency costs of external financing can be responsible for persistent fluctuations in investment and income.

40|$|SESAR is Europe’s ‘Single European Sky Air traffic Research system’, {{targeted}} at post 2020. The vision is to integrate and implement {{new technologies to}} improve air traffic management (ATM) performance. The focus for planning and executing system operations will increasingly be aircraft navigating high-quality 4 D trajectories: a 4 D trajectory is the aircraft path, three space dimensions plus time, from gate-to-gate, ie including the path along {{the ground at the}} airport. A 20 + year ATM plan has to use limited information on the success of innovations and the development of large-scale, often safety critical, software (which by its nature can take markedly longer and costs markedly more than early estimates). SESAR must be sufficiently flexible in deployment to maximise financial benefits to individual stakeholders using their specific financial criteria. Airline needs are the main ATM system/business drivers. Airlines do not want to commit to developing an ‘ultra-modern system’ per se, but rather to one that makes business-sensible investments in new technologies that are indispensable for achieving improved safety and meeting projected capacity requirements. The approach is been to use simple corporate <b>finance</b> <b>ideas</b> to examine the different viewpoints and business environments of air traffic service suppliers (‘ANSPs’) and individual airlines. The key decision-making point is that ANSPs act as agents for airlines as a whole. The key financial point is that a typical airline has to work hard to survive and needs quick paybacks on investment. The design of the SESAR R&D and project portfolios can learn lessons from information technology systems design and deployment. ‘Real option analysis’ of systems can increase business value by improving the sequencing and partitioning of projects, helping to ensure that the system is adaptable to technological innovation and changes in business needs...|$|R

40|$|Managing {{finances}} is {{a practice}} carried out daily in homes across the world. Despite this, {{the practice is}} not yet a strong focus for HCI work in the home. This paper looks specifically at the ways that families organise and manage their finances. Based on a process of in-situ qualitative interviews, we find that money management is often a collaborative process in the family and occurs in a similar way to other household tasks; as part of existing divisions of domestic labour. Participating families reflected upon the creative and often low-tech systems they used to manage their <b>finances</b> and <b>ideas</b> they had for “ideal” technologies that would better help them organise their money. This paper presents ideas for fostering collaboration around family finances.

40|$|Abstract- This paper surveys {{a number}} of {{well-known}} expert systems {{in the domain of}} <b>finance.</b> The <b>idea</b> is to illustrate the span of typical expert systems in finance and to provide an insight into the approaches and techniques they employ. The systems considered in the paper are all working systems, and come from different fields of finance. Specifically, the systems considered are FINEVA (from the field of financial analysis), PORT-MAN (banking management), INVEX (investment advisory) and FAME (financial marketing). The paper also briefly presents DEVEX, an expert system for currency exchange advising in international business transactions. Financial institutions in lessdeveloped and undeveloped countries that deal with currency exchange often face some specific problems that don’t exist in well-developed regions of the world. DEVEX helps bank employees to cope with such problems.

40|$|Because of the {{development}} in communication and transportation technologies, countries across the globe have integrated in various aspects of economic development. Countries are transporting products, <b>finances,</b> information, <b>ideas,</b> and culture more frequently and that has affected their economic growth {{as well as the}} level of national liberties. The effect of globalization has been examined on democracy (Li and Reuveny, 2003), on budgetary autonomy (Heinemann, 2000), on inequality (Beer and Boswell, 2001), on economic growth (Dollar and Kraay, 2001). These studies have used trade flows, capital flows, capital account openness, and openness to trade as proxies for globalization. Study by Rodrik (1996) supports the hypothesis that countries with low democratic rights attract less foreign investment. The effect of foreign direct investment depends on the political structure in the country (Greider, 1998). Based on the political structure in the country, foreign direct investment may not have a liberalizing effect. This study is an empirical analysis of the relationship between globalization and liberties. More specifically, this study analyzes the effects of different dimensions o...|$|R
