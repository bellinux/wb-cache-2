5|$|Polymorphism, or {{the ability}} of a {{substance}} to <b>form</b> more than one crystal structure, is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients. Many drugs are receiving regulatory approval for only a single crystal <b>form</b> or polymorph. For a long time, only one crystal structure for aspirin was known. That aspirin might have a second crystalline <b>form</b> was suspected since the 1960s. The elusive second polymorph was first discovered by Vishweshwar and coworkers in 2005, and fine structural details were given by Bond et al. A new crystal type was found after attempted cocrystallization of aspirin and levetiracetam from hot acetonitrile. The <b>form</b> II is only stable at 100K and reverts to <b>form</b> I at ambient temperature. In the (unambiguous) <b>form</b> I, two salicylic molecules <b>form</b> centrosymmetric dimers through the acetyl groups with the (acidic) methyl proton to carbonyl hydrogen bonds, and in the newly claimed <b>form</b> II, each salicylic molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds with two neighboring molecules instead of one. With respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the carboxylic acid groups, both polymorphs <b>form</b> identical dimer structures.|$|E

40|$|The {{determination}} of <b>forming</b> limit curves and deformation features of AA 5754 aluminium alloy are studied in this article.

The <b>forming</b> limit curves of AA 5754 at elevated temperatures with different high <b>forming</b> speeds have been obtained.
