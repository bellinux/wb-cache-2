5000|$|... ==Flora and fauna== The {{reserve is}} covered 88% by forest, mostly conifers.

50|$|<b>Dahurian</b> <b>larch</b> is {{occasionally}} {{grown in}} botanical gardens in Europe and North America; {{it is not}} an easy tree to grow in areas with mild winters as it is adapted to a long period of winter rest; the warm winter weather in Britain can tempt it into leaf as early as the start of January, with the tender young leaves then being killed by the next frost. In its native region, daily minimum temperatures above freezing do not occur until late May or June, with no further frost until the brief summer is over.|$|E
50|$|The crossbills are characterised by the mandibles {{crossing}} {{at their}} tips, {{which gives the}} group its English name. They are specialist feeders on conifer cones, and the unusual bill shape is an adaptation to assist the extraction of the seeds from the cone. Two-barred crossbill has a strong preference for larch (Larix), in Eurasia using Siberian larch (Larix sibirica) and <b>Dahurian</b> <b>larch</b> (L. gmelinii), and in North America Tamarack larch (L. laricina). It will also take rowan Sorbus berries, and in North America, also eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) and white spruce (Picea glauca) cones.|$|E

5000|$|Taymyr Nature Reserve (Таймырский заповедник) (also Taimyrsky) is a Russian 'zapovednik' (strict nature reserve) {{located in}} the {{northern}} lowlands of Siberia, on the Taimyr Peninsula, and {{on the coast of}} the Laptev Sea of the Arctic Ocean. The reserve includes the most northern forest of <b>Dahurian</b> <b>larch</b> in the world, and also the most northern mainland mountain range in the world. The protected area was established to protect the breeding grounds of the Red-breasted goose (Branta ruficollis) as well as the summer residences of wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) and the biodiversity of the Lake Taymyr. The reserve is situated about 120 km east of the town of Norilsk, and 3,000 km northeast of Moscow, in the Taymyrsky Dolgano-Nenetsky District of Krasnoyarsk Krai. [...] In 1995, the site was designated a UNESCO MAB (Man and Biosphere) Reserve. [...] The reserve was formally established in 1979, and covers an area of 1781928 ha.|$|E
50|$|Since North America and Asia {{used to be}} {{connected}} by the Bering land bridge, a number of animal and plant species (more animals than plants) were able to colonize both continents and are distributed throughout the taiga biome (see Circumboreal Region). Others differ regionally, typically with each genus having several distinct species, each occupying {{different regions of the}} taiga. Taigas also have some small-leaved deciduous trees like birch, alder, willow, and poplar; mostly in areas escaping the most extreme winter cold. However, the <b>Dahurian</b> <b>larch</b> tolerates the coldest winters in the Northern Hemisphere in eastern Siberia. The very southernmost parts of the taiga may have trees such as oak, maple, elm and lime scattered among the conifers, and there is usually a gradual transition into a temperate mixed forest, such as the eastern forest-boreal transition of eastern Canada. In the interior of the continents with the driest climate, the boreal forests might grade into temperate grassland.|$|E

The main forest-forming trees are <b>dahurian</b> <b>larch</b> (Larix gmelinii) and white birch (Betula papyrifera. There are pine forests along the Nora and Burundi rivers. The marshy areas, {{particularly in the}} southern plains spreading from {{the south of the}} reserve, feature extensive moss (green and sphagnum) hummocks of sedges, cotton grass, and reed grass. There are extensive thickets of wild rosemary and shrub birch. The swampy areas include blueberry and cranberry. There are areas of nemoral forest in the flatter lands, featuring linden, maple, elm, and barberry. Scientists on the reserve have recorded 513 species of vascular plants, representing about 25% of the species found in the Amur region. [...] The animal life of the reserve includes representatives of four faunal zones: Eastern Siberia, Okhotsk-Kamchatka, Amur, and Daur-Mongolian. As a result, the Nora protected area includes 43% of all mammal species of the Amur and Primorsky (maritime) regions of the Russian Far East. Many of these mammals are living on the edges of their ranges. Characteristic vertebrates include Siberian roe deer, bear, elk, Siberian salamander, Far Eastern frog, gray-sided vole, East Asian mouse, squirrel, chipmunk, sable, and various waterfowl and birds. Two exotic species were introduced in the 1950s - the American mink and muskrat. 232 species of birds have been recorded in the reserve. The rich levels of fish in the wetland lakes and ponds attract predatory birds - eagles, ospreys, and fish owls.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{moisture}} diffusion coefficient of <b>Dahurian</b> <b>Larch</b> (Larix gmelinii Rupr.) by use of the Finite Difference Method (FDM). To obtain moisture distributions the dimensional boards of <b>Dahurian</b> <b>Larch</b> were dried, from which test samples were cut and sliced evenly into 9 pieces in different drying periods, so that moisture distributions at different locations and times across the thickness of <b>Dahurian</b> <b>Larch</b> were obtained with a weighing method. With these experimental data, FDM was used to solve Fick’s one-dimensional unsteady-state diffusion equation, and the moisture diffusion coefficient across the thickness at specified time was obtained. Results indicated that the moisture diffusion coefficient decreased from the surface {{to the center of}} the <b>Dahurian</b> <b>Larch</b> wood, and it decreased with decreasing moisture content at constant wood temperature; as the wood temperature increased, the moisture diffusion coefficient increased, and the effect of the wood temperature on the moisture diffusion coefficient was more significant than that of moisture content. Moisture diffusion coefficients were different for the two experiments due to differing diffusivity of the specimens...|$|E
40|$|Larix gmelinii (Rupr.) Kuzen. (<b>Dahurian</b> <b>larch)</b> is an {{important}} arctic tree-line species in the northern boreal forests of Eurasia. The region’s climate is predicted to change dramatically over the next century, yet {{little is known about}} how this species will respond to secular changes in temperature and precipitation. To this end, a ring-width chronology from 25 cores from a stand of seven <b>Dahurian</b> <b>larch</b> trees growing in the Secrest Arboretum, northeastern Ohio, was developed to test the climatic sensitivity of the species in a more temperate climate. The chronology extends from 1931 to 2005 and correlation analysis with monthly precipitation and temperature records shows growth was most strongly limited by summer precipitation until recent decades when sensitivity has shifted to late spring precipitation. The results from this study serve as a contemporary analog to the future growth response of <b>Dahurian</b> <b>larch</b> under warmer and wetter growing conditions in the boreal and arctic regions of Eurasia...|$|E
