25|$|For the 1970 comedy {{recording}} Don't Crush That Dwarf, <b>Hand</b> <b>Me</b> the Pliers, Grossman {{painted a}} quartet of caricatures of The Firesign Theatre. The painting depicts the players as animal / human hybrids, with the animal portions signifying each member's Zodiacal sign (each was born under a Fire Sign).|$|E
25|$|This certain look transcended {{into the}} R {{world in the}} mid 1990s when Jodeci came onto the scene, who were crooners but with more edgy and sexual look. By wearing gangster style clothes along with the badboy {{attitude}} and being a R group they appealed to both men and women. Particularly known for their baggy clothing, symbolising a <b>hand</b> <b>me</b> down from an older relative of a bigger build {{as a sign of}} toughness.|$|E
25|$|The air-sea rescue squadrons of the ASRS flew {{a variety}} of aircraft, usually <b>hand</b> <b>me</b> downs {{rejected}} or withdrawn from front line service by the RAF's other branches or {{as in the case}} of the Walrus begged from the Navy. They used Supermarine Spitfires and Boulton Paul Defiants to patrol for downed aircrew and Avro Ansons to drop supplies and dinghies. Supermarine Walrus and Supermarine Sea Otter amphibious craft were used to pick up aircrew from the water. Larger aircraft were used to drop airborne lifeboats. Although the Walrus and Sea Otters could pick up survivors in calm seas, further out to sea and in rougher waters, it was still not possible for aircraft to routinely pick up survivors, the large flying boats that could do so, such as the Catalinas and Short Sunderlands of Coastal Command, had many other jobs to do and were not always available. The role of aircraft in the ASRS therefore, was to locate downed airmen and to keep them alive, by dropping them survival equipment and stores, until an ASRS launch, or one from the Royal Navy's Naval Sea Rescue Services, arrived to pick them up. Generally MCS launches had responsibility for the Channel and North Sea, and Navy ones for the Western Approaches.|$|E

500|$|The first uniform the Air Cadets {{used were}} <b>hand</b> <b>me</b> down uniforms from the Pre War era RCAF. [...] It {{consisted}} of a blue/gray wool uniform; cap (wedge), pants and a full collar tunic. [...] This was phased out in 1943 with an open collar variation similar to the war time RCAF enlisted man’s tunic. [...] After the war the air cadet organization received more <b>hand</b> <b>me</b> down uniforms from the RCAF before adopting the battle dress style uniform.|$|E
500|$|Rado and Ragni {{brought their}} drafts {{of the show}} to {{producer}} Eric Blau who, through common friend Nat Shapiro, connected the two with Canadian composer Galt MacDermot. MacDermot had won a Grammy Award in 1961 for his composition [...] "African Waltz" [...] (recorded by Cannonball Adderley). [...] The composer's lifestyle was {{in marked contrast to}} his co-creators: [...] "I had short hair, a wife, and, at that point, four children, and I lived on Staten Island." [...] "I never even heard of a hippie when I met Rado and Ragni." [...] But he shared their enthusiasm to do a rock and roll show. [...] "We work independently," [...] explained MacDermot in May 1968. [...] "I prefer it that way. [...] They <b>hand</b> <b>me</b> the material. [...] I set it to music." [...] MacDermot wrote the first score in three weeks, starting with the songs [...] "I Got Life", [...] "Ain't Got No", [...] "Where Do I Go" [...] and the title song. [...] He first wrote [...] "Aquarius" [...] as an unconventional art piece, but later rewrote it into an uplifting anthem.|$|E
500|$|According to Paul Neurath, Ultima Underworld II and its {{predecessor}} together sold {{half a million}} units. Paul Presley of PC Review called the game [...] "huge" [...] and praised its atmosphere, increased variety and higher graphical detail. However, {{he found that the}} game, unlike {{its predecessor}}, does not feature [...] "anything that takes it to a higher plateau to wait for the others to catch up". He summarized Ultima Underworld II as [...] "magnificent", and he wrote, [...] "If someone were to <b>hand</b> <b>me</b> £40 and say buy either Underworld I or II, I'd take the sequel any time." [...] PC Zones David McCandless wrote, [...] "Nothing can completely prepare you for the freedom the game gives you ... It's about as close to Virtual Reality as you are ever likely to get from your mouse driver." [...] He praised the game's atmospheric sound and called its graphics [...] "stunning": on a high-end computer, he found that [...] "dungeons can move like a film". Partly because of the game's large size, he felt that Ultima Underworld II was looser and less involving than its predecessor, but he concluded that players would still [...] "sit there, dribble slightly, and say 'blimey' every eight to ten minutes." ...|$|E

500|$|The Hardy Boys {{began to}} be {{published}} in paperback in 1979. The Hardys were also featured in two new series, the Hardy Boys Casefiles and the Clues Brothers. The latter series, modeled on the Nancy Drew Notebooks, was aimed at a younger audience, and ran from 1997 to 2000. In contrast, the Casefiles, begun a decade earlier in 1987, was aimed at an older audience than the Hardy Boys Mystery Stories. In the new series, the Hardys' work with a secret government organization simply called the [...] "Network", with which they collaborate to [...] "infiltrate organized crime, battle terrorists and track down assassins around the world." [...] The Hardys' personalities are portrayed as more separate and distinct, and they sometimes fight; in the first of the series, Dead on Target, for example, the brothers brawl after Frank tries to restrain Joe after Joe's girlfriend, Iola Morton, is killed by a car bomb. In general, the series is more violent, and the Hardy Boys carry various guns; Lines like [...] "Joe! <b>Hand</b> <b>me</b> the Uzi!" [...] are not out of character. Barbara Steiner, a Casefiles ghostwriter, describes a sample plot outline: [...] "I was told that Joe Hardy would get involved with a waitress, a black widow kind of character, and that Joe would get arrested for murder. I was told the emphasis was on high action and suspense and {{there had to be a}} cliff-hanger ending to every chapter." ...|$|E
500|$|Contrary to {{her present}} style, M.I.A.'s Arular era style has been {{described}} as [...] "tattered <b>hand</b> <b>me</b> downs and patched T-shirts of indigents", embodying the [...] "uniform of the refugee" [...] but modified with cuts, alterations and colours to fashion a distinctly new style and apparel line. M.I.A. built on this during the Kala era with a [...] "playful" [...] combination of baggy T-shirts, leggings and short-shorts. She incorporated eccentric accessories in bold patterns, sparkle and [...] "over-saturated" [...] neon colour to fashion her signature style which inspired flocks of [...] "garishly-clothed all-too-sassy" [...] new-rave girls with bright red tights, cheetah-skin smock and faded 1980s T- shirts. Her commodifying and performance of this refugee image has been noted to [...] "reposition" [...] perceptions of it in the wider public. Hailed as presenting a challenge to the mainstream with her ironic style, M.I.A. has been praised for dictating such a subcultural trend worldwide, combining [...] "adolescent" [...] frustrations of race and class with a strong desire to dance. Eddy Lawrence of Time Out commented how her multi genre style contributed to her being beloved of the broadsheet fashionistas yet simultaneously patron saint and pin-up for the Day-Glo nu-rave kids. Similarly, Mary Beth Ray, in the book Rock Brands: Selling Sound in a Media Saturated Culture writes that M.I.A.'s hybrid style addressed a number of social and political issues including power, violence, identity and survival in a globalised world, while using avenues that challenged [...] "traditional" [...] definitions of {{what it meant to be}} a contemporary pop artist.|$|E

2500|$|On 13 December 2007 Michael Rose {{announced}} that, {{in light}} of [...] "a possible attempt to initially suppress {{the seriousness of the}} incident, I am asking the chief constable of Devon and Cornwall to <b>hand</b> <b>me</b> evidence gathered {{at the time of the}} original investigation," [...] and for the chief constable to appoint a senior detective [...] "to look into the allegations of a possible cover-up." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first Guatemalan head {{of state}} taken from {{civilian}} life in over 50 years, Estrada Cabrera overcame resistance to his regime by August 1898 and called for September elections, which he won handily. At that time, Estrada Cabrera was 44 years old; he was stocky, of medium height, and broad-shouldered. The mustache gave him plebeian appearance. Black and dark eyes, metallic sounding voice and was rather sullen and brooding. At the same time, he already showed his courage and character. This was demonstrated {{on the night of}} the death of Reina Barrios when he stood in front of the ministers, meeting in the Government Palace to choose a successor, and said: [...] "Gentlemen, let me please sign this decree. As First Designated, you must <b>hand</b> <b>me</b> the Presidency". His first decree was a general amnesty and the second was to reopen all the elementary schools closed by Reyna Barrios, both administrative and political measures aimed at winning over public opinion. Estrada Cabrera was almost unknown in the political circles of the capital and one could not foresee the features of his government or his intentions.|$|E
