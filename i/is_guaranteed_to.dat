Penny {{arrives at the}} pageant with Edna, while Wilbur, Seaweed, and the Negro Day kids help Tracy infiltrate the studio. Link breaks away from Amber to dance with Tracy; later, he pulls Seaweed's sister, Little Inez, to the stage to dance in the pageant.|$|E
5|$|The {{hash value}} that this class {{associates}} with each object, its identityHashCode, <b>is</b> <b>guaranteed</b> <b>to</b> remain fixed for {{the lifetime of}} an object but is otherwise arbitrary. Because the identityHashCode is constructed only once per object, and {{is not required to}} be related to the object's address or value, its construction may involve slower computations such as the call to a random or pseudorandom number generator. For instance, Java 8 uses an Xorshift pseudorandom number generator to construct these values.|$|E
5|$|Avicenna {{distinguishes between}} {{a thing that}} needs an {{external}} cause in order to exista contingent thingand a thing that <b>is</b> <b>guaranteed</b> <b>to</b> exist by its essence or intrinsic naturea necessary existent. The argument, or proof, tries to prove that there is indeed a necessary existent. It does this by first considering whether the opposite could be true: that everything that exists is contingent. Each contingent thing will need something other than itself to bring it into existence, which will in turn need another cause to bring it into existence, and so on. Because this seemed to lead to an infinite regress, cosmological arguments before Avicenna concluded that some necessary cause (such as God) is needed to end the infinite chain. However, Avicenna's argument does not preclude {{the possibility of an}} infinite regress.|$|E

5|$|Democracy {{essentially}} means {{rule of the}} people. To build {{a democratic}} society and rule, there must be citizen participation by an informed electorate. The freedom to speak and express is thus crucial {{for the formation of}} public opinion on political questions, and is indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth. In Singapore, the right to freedom of speech and expression <b>is</b> <b>guaranteed</b> <b>to</b> citizens by Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution, though it is subject to many qualifications. Parliament may by law impose restrictions on the right as it considers necessary or expedient {{in the interest of the}} security of Singapore, friendly relations with other countries, public order or morality, and restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide against contempt of court, defamation or incitement to any offence.|$|E
5|$|In {{physical}} systems, Noether's theorem {{provides an}} equivalence between conservation laws and symmetries of the system. However, for cellular automata this theorem {{does not directly}} apply, because instead of being governed by {{the energy of the}} system the behavior of the automaton is encoded into its rules, and the automaton <b>is</b> <b>guaranteed</b> <b>to</b> obey certain symmetries (translation invariance in both space and time) regardless of any conservation laws it might obey. Nevertheless, the conserved quantities of certain reversible systems behave similarly to energy in some respects. For instance, if different regions of the automaton have different average values of some conserved quantity, the automaton's rules may cause this quantity to dissipate, so that the distribution of the quantity is more uniform in later states. Using these conserved quantities as a stand-in for the energy of the system can allow it to be analyzed using methods from classical physics.|$|E
5|$|On , 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court {{ruled in}} the {{landmark}} case of Obergefell v. Hodges, , holding {{that the fundamental}} right to marry <b>is</b> <b>guaranteed</b> <b>to</b> same-sex couples by both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Fourteen counties in three Southern states continued to deny marriage licenses for same-sex marriage. The Alabama Supreme Court allowed the probate judges of ten counties in Alabama to deny such marriage licenses, the clerk of one Texas county chose to resign rather than issue such licenses, and the clerks of two counties in Kentucky were not issuing licenses due to paperwork delays. Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear ordered all Kentucky county clerks to begin issuing same-sex marriage licenses immediately.|$|E

5|$|The {{right to}} {{freedom of speech and}} expression, which <b>is</b> <b>guaranteed</b> <b>to</b> Singapore {{citizens}} by Article 14 of the Constitution of Singapore, is essential to the concept of representative democracy. Mechanisms available for the exercise of the right include the freedom of speech and debate in Parliament, Speakers' Corner, and the new media. However, Article 14 enables Parliament to restrict the right to free speech on various grounds. One of these is the protection of reputation. Critics have charged that Cabinet ministers and members of the ruling People's Action Party have used civil defamation suits against opposition politicians to inhibit their activities and exclude them from Parliament. The Government has said that there is no evidence substantiating such claims. In addition, both media ownership and content are carefully regulated by the Government. Article 14 protects the right {{to freedom of}} assembly which is relevant to free speech as the latter is often exercised at assemblies and gatherings. Free assembly is restricted in Singapore through laws that require permits to be obtained before events are held, though an exception is made for indoor events involving organizers and speakers who are citizens.|$|E
