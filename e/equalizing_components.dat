40|$|Two central {{problems}} in a fiscal transfer system relate to resolving vertical and horizontal imbalances. In {{the context of the}} setting of the 13 th Finance Commission, this paper looks at the methodological background of fiscal transfers followed by recent Finance Commissions in India, particularly the Twelfth Finance Commission (TFC). It is noted that in India, there is long- term stability in the share of states after transfers in the combined revenues of the centre and the states. It is argued that this stability depends on linking the share of states in the transfers, particularly tax devolution with the difference in the buoyancies of central and states taxes. In the context of horizontal imbalance, it is argued that some of the recent Finance Commissions have implicitly followed an axiomatic approach to tax devolution and brought in some normative elements in determining grants. In spite of large difference in fiscal capacities, a high degree of equalization has been achieved. It is shown, for example, {{that in the case of}} TFC recommended transfers, nearly 88 percent of needed equalization was achieved while devoting 50 percent of transfers to resolving vertical imbalance. A methodology is also developed to determine weights of vertical and <b>equalizing</b> <b>components</b> of transfers through devolution. In the case of the Twelfth Finance Commission, the horizontal component of tax devolution is strengthened by a scheme of equalizing health and education grants. Acknowledgemen...|$|E
30|$|Instead of {{the full}} match of the {{cumulative}} histogram that is implemented by THEQ, QHEQ [30, 3] uses a quantile-corrective manner to calibrate the CDF of each feature vector component of the test speech {{to that of the}} training speech [29]. In QHEQ, a transformation function is estimated by minimizing the mismatch between the quantiles of the test utterance and those of the training data. The transformation function is then applied to each feature component x to make the CDF of the <b>equalized</b> <b>component</b> match that observed in training. The estimation of the transformation function can be implemented using a single test utterance (or extremely, a very short utterance), without the need of an additional set of adaptation data [3]. On the other hand, in order to find the optimum transformation parameters for each feature vector component, an exhaustive online grid search is needed. This search process is very time-consuming [29].|$|R
40|$|A {{multispectral}} histogram normalization or decorrelation enhancement which achieves effective color composites {{by removing}} interband correlation is described. The enhancement procedure employs either linear or nonlinear transformations to <b>equalize</b> principal <b>component</b> variances. An additional rotation to any set of orthogonal coordinates is thus possible, while full histogram utilization is maintained by avoiding the reintroduction of correlation. For the three-dimensional case, the enhancement procedure may be implemented with a lookup table. An {{application of the}} enhancement to Landsat multispectral scanning imagery is presented...|$|R
3000|$|On the one hand, (41) {{suggests}} that x̂_NL(k -L) is an estimate for x(k−L), obtained via linear filtering of y(k). On the other hand, the linear equalizer ĥ_eq,l (k) cannot <b>equalize</b> the nonlinear <b>components</b> of the LEMS, {{such that the}} nonlinear distortion remains in the equalizer output and x̂_NL(k - L) according to (41) {{can be seen as}} an estimate for the nonlinearly distorted signal x [...]...|$|R
40|$|Observational {{evidence}} {{in space and}} astrophysical plasmas with long collisional mean free path suggests that more massive charged particles may be preferentially heated. One possible mechanism {{for this is the}} turbulent cascade of energy from injection to dissipation scales, where the energy is converted to heat. Here we consider a simple system consisting of a magnetized plasma slab of electrons and a single ion species with a cross-field density gradient. We show that such a system is subject to an electron drift wave instability, known as the universal instability, which is stabilized only when the electron and ion thermal speeds are equal. For unequal thermal speeds, we find that the instability gives rise to turbulent energy exchange between ions and electrons that acts to equalize the thermal speeds. Consequently, this turbulent heating tends to <b>equalize</b> the <b>component</b> temperatures of pair plasmas and to heat ions to much higher temperatures than electrons for conventional mass-ratio plasmas.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new control {{strategy}} for threephase shunt active power filter that is capable for three-wire or four-wire systems. It {{is based on}} Instantaneous Representative Active Power Equality. The principle of this control method is to <b>equalize</b> the dc <b>component</b> of instantaneous representative active power of the source and load that include zero-sequence power and losses compensation. This control method is capable to operate under nonideal main voltages and can force source currents nearly sinusoidal with unity power factor. Application in four-wire systems will reduce neutral current at source side. Simulations are done to verify analysis...|$|R
40|$|An {{asymmetric}} chiral metamaterial {{structure is}} constructed by using four double-layered U-shaped split ring resonators, which are each rotated by 90 ° {{with respect to}} their neighbors. The peculiarity of the suggested design is that the sizes of the electrically and magnetically excited rings are different, which allows for <b>equalizing</b> the orthogonal <b>components</b> of the electric field at the output interface with a 90 ° phase difference when the periodic structure is illuminated by an x-polarized wave. As a result, left-hand circular polarization and right-hand circular polarization are obtained in transmission at 5 : 1 GHz and 6 : 4 GHz, respectively. The experiment results are in good agreement with the numerical results. © 2011 Optical Society of America...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{functional}} {{framework for the}} design of tight steerable wavelet frames in any number of dimensions. The 2 -D version of the method {{can be viewed as a}} generalization of Simoncelli's steerable pyramid that gives access to a larger palette of steerable wavelets via a suitable parametrization. The backbone of our construction is a primal isotropic wavelet frame that provides the multiresolution decomposition of the signal. The steerable wavelets are obtained by applying a one-to-many mapping (Nth-order generalized Riesz transform) to the primal ones. The shaping of the steerable wavelets is controlled by an M×M unitary matrix (where M is the number of wavelet channels) that can be selected arbitrarily; this allows for a much wider range of solutions than the traditional equiangular configuration (steerable pyramid). We give a complete functional description of these generalized wavelet transforms and derive their steering equations. We describe some concrete examples of transforms, including some built around a Mallat-type multiresolution analysis of L(2) (R(d)), and provide a fast Fourier transform-based decomposition algorithm. We also propose a principal-component-based method for signal-adapted wavelet design. Finally, we present some illustrative examples together with a comparison of the denoising performance of various brands of steerable transforms. The results are in favor of an optimized wavelet design (<b>equalized</b> principal <b>component</b> analysis), which consistently performs best...|$|R
