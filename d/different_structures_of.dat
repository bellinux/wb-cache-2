5|$|Mitochondria (and related structures) {{are found}} in all eukaryotes (except one—the Oxymonad Monocercomonoides sp.). Although {{commonly}} depicted as bean-like structures they form a highly dynamic network {{in the majority of}} cells where they constantly undergo fission and fusion. Mitochondria vary in number and location according to cell type. A single mitochondrion is often found in unicellular organisms. Conversely, numerous mitochondria {{are found in}} human liver cells, with about 1000–2000 mitochondria per cell, making up 1/5 of the cell volume. The population of all the mitochondria of a given cell constitutes the chondriome. The mitochondrial content of otherwise similar cells can vary substantially in size and membrane potential, with differences arising from sources including uneven partitioning at cell divisions, leading to extrinsic differences in ATP levels and downstream cellular processes. The mitochondria can be found nestled between myofibrils of muscle or wrapped around the sperm flagellum. Often, they form a complex 3D branching network inside the cell with the cytoskeleton. The association with the cytoskeleton determines mitochondrial shape, which can affect the function as well: <b>different</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> the mitochondrial network may afford the population a variety of physical, chemical, and signalling advantages or disadvantages. Mitochondria in cells are always distributed along microtubules and the distribution of these organelles is also correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum. Recent evidence suggests that vimentin, one of the components of the cytoskeleton, is also critical to the association with the cytoskeleton.|$|E

The <b>different</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> malic and lactic acids {{leads to a}} reduction of titratable acidity (TA) in the wine by 1 to 3 g/l {{and an increase in}} pH by 0.3 units. Malic acid is present in the grape throughout the growing season, reaching its peak at veraison and gradually decreasing throughout the ripening process. Grapes harvested from cooler climates usually have the highest malic content and have the most dramatic changes in TA and pH levels after malolactic fermentation.|$|E
2500|$|Inaccuracy of {{formulas}} (16) {{and their}} refined version {{is caused by}} the frequency dispersion of the coupling coefficients that may varies in a great degree for <b>different</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> resonators and filters. In other words, the optimal values of the coupling coefficients [...] at frequency [...] depend on both specifications of the required passband and values of the derivatives [...] That means the exact values of the coefficients [...] ensuring the required passband can not be known beforehand. They may be established only after filter optimization. Therefore, the formulas (16) may be used to determine initial values of the coupling coefficients before optimization of the filter.|$|E

In {{contemporary}} times, some traditional-style soul foods have been implicated in the abnormally high rates of high blood pressure (hypertension), type 2 diabetes, clogged arteries (atherosclerosis), stroke, and heart attack suffered by Americans – especially those living in the Southern and Central United States. [...] A foundational difference in how health is perceived of being contemporary is that soul food may differ from 'traditional' styles is the widely <b>different</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> agriculture. Fueled by federal subsidies, the agricultural system in the United States became industrialized as the nutritional value of most processed foods, and not just those implicated in a traditional perception of soul food, have degraded.

2500|$|The debate {{began in}} 1972, when, in his paper [...] "Signature Event Context", Derrida {{analyzed}} J. L. Austin's {{theory of the}} illocutionary act. While sympathetic to Austin's departure from a purely denotational account of language to one that includes [...] "force", Derrida was sceptical of the framework of normativity employed by Austin. He argued that Austin had missed the fact that any speech event is framed by a [...] "structure of absence" [...] (the words that are left unsaid due to contextual constraints) and by [...] "iterability" [...] (the constraints on what can be said, given by what has been said in the past). Derrida argued that the focus on intentionality in speech-act theory was misguided because intentionality is restricted to that which is already established as a possible intention. He also took issue with the way Austin had excluded the study of fiction, non-serious or [...] "parasitic" [...] speech, wondering whether this exclusion was because Austin had considered these speech genres governed by <b>different</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> meaning, or simply {{due to a lack}} of interest.|$|E
