25|$|On 19 May 2010, Norfolk Naval Shipyard {{completed}} the six-month Planned Incremental Availability (PIA) maintenance cycle on Reagan. This PIA project came in under budget, and it marked both Norfolk Naval Shipyard's largest off-site availability, {{as well as}} the largest public-sector work package ever performed on an aircraft carrier berthed at Naval Air Station North Island located near Coronado, California (pictured). During the maintenance period, Ronald Reagan received technological upgrades that prepared it for its next deployment and subsequent operations. Refurbishments included high-tech combat systems and firefighting equipment to improved ship's laundry services and living spaces. This PIA maintenance project was an example of the 'One Shipyard' concept wherein the U.S. Navy mobilizes <b>its</b> <b>work</b> <b>force</b> across its various shipyards to better meet fleet readiness requirements and to stabilize a vital workforce base for the U.S. defense industry. While Norfolk Naval Shipyard (NNSY) was the project lead, significant work was done by its partners: Puget Sound Naval Shipyard & Intermediate Maintenance Facility (PSNS), Southwest Regional Maintenance Center (SRMC), and Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding (NGSB).|$|E
25|$|The first Gulf War {{triggered}} by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990, sent fuel prices skyrocketing, which severely depressed global economic activity. This in turn caused a sharp contraction of worldwide air travel demand, plunging once profitable operations, including Pan Am's prime transatlantic routes, into steep losses. These unforeseen events constituted a further major blow to Pan Am, which was {{still reeling from the}} 1988 Lockerbie disaster. To shore up its finances, Pan Am sold most of its routes serving London Heathrow – arguably Pan Am's most important international destination – to United Airlines. This left Pan Am with only two daily London flights, serving Detroit and Miami, which used Gatwick as their London terminal {{from the start of the}} 1990/91 winter timetable. Further asset disposals included Pan Am's sale of its IGS routes to Berlin to Lufthansa for $150million, which became effective at the same time and brought the total value of asset disposals to $1.2billion. These measures were accompanied by the elimination of 2,500 jobs (8.6% of <b>its</b> <b>work</b> <b>force).</b> These cutbacks had already been announced by the airline in September 1990.|$|E
500|$|As of 1999, Baltimore {{experienced}} 300 murders a year, {{which was}} the fourth most in the nation. Unemployment was 9%, twice the national average. [...] Between 1990 and 1998, Baltimore saw its population decrease by 12.3%, the second-biggest decrease during that time period in the United States. This decrease led to <b>its</b> <b>work</b> <b>force</b> decreasing by one-sixth. The city saw decreases in heavy-manufacturing by 40percent, distribution jobs by 35percent, retail positions by 34percent, and banking jobs by 28percent. Also, the state of Maryland {{had taken over the}} city's failing school system in 1996, which upset African American politicians. State Senator Clarence M. Mitchell, IV called the takeover racist. Baltimore City Council members, including President Lawrence Bell and Martin O'Malley, had opposed the handling of Baltimore's high crime rate by Schmoke and Baltimore Police Department (BPD) Commissioner Thomas C.

500|$|This {{building}} {{contained the}} offices of the Westinghouse Air Brake Company for well over a century. The company was originally established by George Westinghouse in 1869. Westinghouse had developed many companies during this time of industrial growth {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century. The Air Brake plant, that made for improved performance and increased speed on the nations railways, was moved to its new location in Wilmerding, Pennsylvania in 1889. Wilmerding is a small town about [...] outside of Pittsburgh which, at the time, was only inhabited by about 5,000 people. Socialism was strong in Wilmerding and it was a peaceful non-violent farming borough. It was thought to be “The Ideal Town” for the company because of its location right along the Pennsylvania Railroad and its mainly blue collar inhabitants. The Air Brake Company employed 3,000 citizens from the surrounding Pittsburgh area, but <b>its</b> <b>work</b> <b>force</b> was composed almost entirely of individuals from Wilmerding.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, Oracle {{laid off}} 10% (about 400 people) of <b>its</b> <b>work</b> <b>force</b> because of {{accounting}} errors. This crisis {{came about because}} of Oracle's [...] "up-front" [...] marketing strategy, in which sales people urged potential customers to buy the largest possible amount of software all at once. The sales people then booked the value of future license sales in the current quarter, thereby increasing their bonuses. This became a problem when the future sales subsequently failed to materialize. Oracle eventually had to restate its earnings twice, and also settled (out of court) class-action lawsuits arising from its having overstated its earnings. Ellison stated in 1992 that Oracle had made [...] "an incredible business mistake." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 1916, Britain was funding {{most of the}} Empire's war expenditures, all of Italy's and {{two thirds}} of the war costs of France and Russia, plus smaller nations as well. The gold reserves, {{overseas}} investments and private credit then ran out, forcing Britain to borrow $ twenty five billion from the U.S. Treasury in 1917–18. [...] Much of this money was spent paying United States industries to manufacture ammunition. United States Cartridge Company expanded <b>its</b> <b>work</b> <b>force</b> ten-fold in response to September 1914 contracts with British purchasing agents; and ultimately manufactured over two billion rifle and machine gun cartridges. Baldwin Locomotive Works expanded their Eddystone, Pennsylvania, manufacturing facilities in 1915 to manufacture Russian artillery shells and British rifles. The United States production of smokeless powder was equal to the combined production of the European Allies during the last 19 months of the war; {{and by the end of}} the war United States factories were producing smokeless powder at a rate 45 percent higher than the European Allies' combined production. Production rate of explosives by the United States was similarly 40 percent higher than Britain and nearly twice that of France. Shipments of American raw materials and food allowed Britain to feed itself and its army while maintaining her productivity. [...] The financing was generally successful. Heavy investment in ammunition manufacturing machinery did not bring long term prosperity to some major American companies. The United States Cartridge Company Lowell, Massachusetts, factory which manufactured nearly two-thirds of the small arms cartridges produced in the United States during the war, closed eight years later. After Baldwin manufactured over six million artillery shells, nearly two million rifles, and 5,551 military locomotives for Russia, France, Britain and the United States, postwar production never used more than one-third the capacity of the Eddystone factory; and Baldwin declared bankruptcy in 1935.|$|E

Despite ARBED's international sales network's restructuring in 1976 (Columeta was renamed TradeARBED) {{and the establishment}} of TrefilARBED Korea in 1978, by 1983, steel production had slumped back to 1955 levels (3.2 million tonnes, compared with 6.45 million tonnes in 1974).
