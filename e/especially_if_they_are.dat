5|$|Beagle {{required}} {{large numbers}} of chronometers because some would inevitably break down on long voyages and the chronometers were essential for {{the mission of the}} ship. Further, the rates of all chronometers vary with time. Although this can be allowed for by interpolating between the regular rate checks, {{there is no guarantee that}} the changes are linear, and often they are not. Averaging the readings from a large number of chronometers, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> of a variety of types, will tend to cancel out such errors.|$|E

25|$|Old Hong Kong Mahjong {{is played}} with a {{standard}} set of Mahjong tiles (though cards may be used). Sets often include counters (to keep score), dice (to decide how to deal) and a marker to show who the dealer is and which round is being played. Some sets include racks to hold the tiles, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> larger/smaller than standard tiles or have an odd shape.|$|E
25|$|Certified HEPA (tested to MIL STD 282) can {{effectively}} trap 99.97% of dust at 0.3 micrometers. Not all HEPA (type/media) filters {{can effectively}} stop dust; while vacuum cleaners with HEPA (type/media) filters, water, or cyclones may filter {{more effectively than}} without, they may still exhaust millions of particles per cubic foot of air circulated. Central vacuum cleaners can be effective in removing dust, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> exhausted directly to the outdoors.|$|E
25|$|Some {{classes of}} bugs {{have nothing to}} do with the code. Faulty {{documentation}} or hardware may lead to problems in system use, even though the code matches the documentation. In some cases, changes to the code eliminate the problem even though the code then no longer matches the documentation. Embedded systems frequently work around hardware bugs, since to make a new version of a ROM is much cheaper than remanufacturing the hardware, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> commodity items.|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} {{to what is}} commonly believed, {{research has found that}} better-than-average effects are not universal. In fact, much recent research has found the opposite effect in many tasks, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> more difficult.|$|R
25|$|Most {{people who}} have {{experienced}} a traumatic event will not develop PTSD. People who experience interpersonal trauma (for example rape or child abuse) {{are more likely to}} develop PTSD, as compared to people who experience non-assault based trauma such as accidents and natural disasters. About half of people develop PTSD following rape. Children are less likely than adults to develop PTSD after trauma, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> under ten years of age. Diagnosis is based on the presence of specific symptoms following a traumatic event.|$|E
25|$|Pippi is red-haired, freckled, {{unconventional}} and superhumanly strong – able to {{lift her}} horse one-handed. She is playful and unpredictable. She often makes fun of unreasonable adults, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> pompous and condescending. Her anger comes out in extreme cases, such as when a man ill-treats his horse. Pippi, like Peter Pan, {{does not want to}} grow up. She is the daughter of a buccaneer captain and has adventure stories to tell about that too. Her four best friends are her horse and monkey, and the neighbours' children, Tommy and Annika.|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} gloves on the {{injuries}} caused during a fight is a controversial issue. Hitting {{to the head}} was less common in the bare-knuckle era {{because of the risk}} of hurting the boxer's hand. Gloves reduce the number of cuts caused, but British Medical Association research has stated that gloves do not reduce brain injuries and may even increase them, because the main cause of injury is acceleration and deceleration of the head, and fighters wearing gloves are able to punch harder to the head. Gloves may reduce the amount of eye injuries, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> thumbless, but retinal tears and detached retinas still occur to boxers wearing modern gloves.|$|E

5000|$|Mi Mujer es Candidata is {{a comedy}} in one act, first staged on December 30, 1932. It was written when women first ran as {{candidates}} {{for public office}} in a general election.

25|$|Floaters {{present at}} birth usually remain lifelong, while those that appear later may {{disappear}} within weeks or months. They are not uncommon, {{and do not}} cause serious problems for most persons; they represent {{one of the most}} common presentations to hospital eye services. A survey of optometrists in 2002 suggested that an average of 14 patients per month per optometrist presented with symptoms of floaters in the UK. However, floaters are more than a nuisance and a distraction to those with severe cases, especially if the spots seem to constantly drift through the field of vision. The shapes are shadows projected onto the retina by tiny structures of protein or other cell debris discarded over the years and trapped in the vitreous humour. Floaters can even be seen when the eyes are closed on especially bright days, when sufficient light penetrates the eyelids to cast the shadows. It is not, however, only elderly persons who are troubled by floaters; they can also become a problem to younger people, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> myopic. They are also common after cataract operations or after trauma.|$|E
500|$|The book {{states that}} Seitz, Singer, Nierenberg and Robert Jastrow were all {{fiercely}} anti-communist and they viewed government regulation {{as a step}} towards socialism and communism. The authors argue that, {{with the collapse of}} the Soviet Union, they looked for another great threat to free market capitalism and found it in environmentalism. They feared that an over-reaction to environmental problems would lead to heavy-handed government intervention in the marketplace and intrusion into people's lives. Oreskes and Conway state that the longer the delay the worse these problems get, and the more likely it is that governments will need to take the draconian measures that conservatives and market fundamentalists most fear. They say that Seitz, Singer, Nierenberg and Jastrow denied the scientific evidence, contributed to a strategy of delay, and thereby helped to bring about the situation they most dreaded. The authors have a strong doubt about the ability of the media to differentiate between false truth and the actual science in question; however, they stop short of endorsing censorship in the name of science. The journalistic norm of balanced reporting has helped, according to the authors, to amplify the misleading messages of the contrarians. Oreskes and Conway state: [...] "small numbers of people can have large, negative impacts, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> organised, determined and have access to power".|$|E
500|$|The cap of H.eburneus is [...] broad, with a shape {{ranging from}} convex to flattened, {{sometimes}} with an umbo (a raised {{area in the}} center of the cap). In age the cap margin sometimes becomes elevated and the center of the cap depressed. The cap is pure white, and depending on the moisture in the environment, may be [...] to sticky. The cap surface is smooth, the margin is even and in young specimens, rolled inward and covered with short fibrils. The flesh is white, thick {{in the center of}} the cap but thinning toward the margin. The odor and taste are mild. The gills are somewhat arcuate-decurrent, meaning they are shaped like a bow, curving upward and then running down the stem for a short distance. In terms of spacing, they are subdistant to distant, so that space can be seen between them. The gills are moderately broad, broadest near the stem, narrowed in front, pure white, slightly yellowish or buff with age or when dried. The stem is [...] long, [...] thick, equal in width throughout its length to somewhat tapered downward or with a greatly attenuated base, and glutinous. Its surface is silky beneath the gluten. The top of the stem is covered with short fibrils, pure white, sometimes becoming grayish or dirty with age. It is initially stuffed with cotton-like mycelia, then later becomes hollow. The caps of dried fruit bodies will typically remain white, while the stems will dry darker, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> initially waterlogged.|$|E
50|$|The {{authorities}} greatly {{disapproved of}} all this, as {{the purpose of}} an execution was to put fear in people, a purpose which was destroyed by these theatrical performances, which, according to the government, gave the audience sympathy for the condemned suicidals, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> female.|$|R
50|$|Whistleblowers Australia Inc. is an {{association}} {{for those who}} have exposed corruption or any form of malpractice, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> then hindered or abused, and for those who are thinking of exposing it or who wish to support those who are doing so. The organisation began as Whistleblowers Anonymous in 1991.|$|R
50|$|Other {{factors which}} entrench welfare dependency, {{particularly}} for women, include lack of affordable childcare, low education and skill levels, and unavailability of suitable jobs.

[...] However their urine is often pungent, particularly with males, and could stain fabric.|$|E
2500|$|One {{brand of}} {{levonorgestrel}} pills was marketed {{as an ongoing}} method of postcoital contraception.

2500|$|Capturing and {{compressing}} [...] {{may increase}} the energy needs of a coal-fired CCS plant by 25–40%. These and other system costs are estimated to increase the cost per watt energy produced by 21–91% for fossil fuel power plants. Applying the technology to existing plants would be more expensive, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> far from a sequestration site. A 2005 industry report suggests that with successful research, development and deployment (RD), sequestered coal-based electricity generation in 2025 may cost less than unsequestered coal-based electricity generation today.|$|E

2500|$|Although Old Irish {{has both}} a sound [...] {{and a letter}} h, there is no {{consistent}} relationship between the two. Vowel-initial words are sometimes written with an unpronounced h, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> very short (the preposition [...] "in" [...] was sometimes written [...] ) or {{if they need to}} be emphasised (the name of Ireland, , was sometimes written [...] ). On the other hand, words that begin with the sound [...] are usually written without it: [...] "her gold". If the sound and the spelling co-occur, it is by coincidence, as [...] "it is not".|$|E
2500|$|Classical, biblical, {{and similar}} names {{ending in a}} sibilant, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> polysyllabic, do not take an added s in the possessive; among sources giving {{exceptions}} of this kind are The Times and The Elements of Style, which make general stipulations, and Vanderbilt University, which mentions only Moses and Jesus. As a particular case, Jesus is very commonly written instead of Jesus’s– even by people who would otherwise add ’s in, for example, James’s or Chris’s. Jesus’ {{is referred to as}} [...] "an accepted liturgical archaism" [...] in Hart’s Rules.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] (Latin for 'body') here denotes a {{collection}} of documents; corpus juris, {{a collection}} of laws, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> placed in systematic order. It may signify also an official and complete collection of a legislation made by the legislative power, comprising all the laws which are in force in a country or society. The term, although it never received legal sanction in either Roman or canon law, being merely academic phraseology, {{is used in the}} above sense when the [...] "Corpus juris civilis" [...] of the Christian Roman Emperors is meant.|$|E
