Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation is the next generation light source for overcoming the resolution limit of conventional photolithography {{in order to obtain}} nanostructures of higher density. In this thesis, we focus on investigating resolution limits of interference patterns produced by EUV radiation. Optical properties of interference fringes obtained using different types of compact EUV sources are studied with regard to increasing pattern density. Rigorous simulations of optical wave propagation of EUV radiation are performed to investigate the resolution limits of interference fringes for the fractional Talbot effect, the achromatic Talbot effect, and an image of Talbot carpet that has an optical property of ever-decreasing size of interference fringes. In experiments, interference lithography has been performed with three different types of compact EUV sources including a gas discharge produced plasma, a plasma based EUV laser, and a high-harmonic generation source.

Also, larger molecular weights and sizes appear to reduce corner rounding.In unidirectional metal layers, tip-to-tip spacing is one of the more severe issues for single exposure patterning. For the 40 nm pitch vertical lines, an 18 nm nominal tip-to-tip drawn gap resulted in an actual tip-to-tip distance of 29 nm with OPC (optical proximity correction), while for 32 nm pitch horizontal lines, the tip-to-tip distance with a 14 nm nominal gap went to 31 nm with OPC. These actual tip-to-tip distances define a lower limit of the half-pitch of the metal running in the direction perpendicular to the tip. In this case, the lower limit is around 30 nm. With further optimization of the illumination (discussed in the section on source-mask optimization), the lower limit can be further reduced to around 25 nm. For larger pitches, where conventional illumination can be used, the line tip-to-tip distance is generally larger. For the 24 nm half-pitch lines, with a 20 nm nominally drawn gap, the distance was actually 45 nm, while for 32 nm half-pitch lines, the same nominal gap resulted in a tip-to-tip distance of 34 nm. With OPC, these become 39 nm and 28 nm for 24 nm half-pitch and 32 nm half-pitch, respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Computational Lithography {{means the}} use of {{computers}} to simulate printing of micro-lithography structures. Pioneering work was done by Chris Mack at NSA in developing PROLITH, Rick Dill at IBM and Andy Neureuther at University of California, Berkeley from the early 1980s. These tools were limited to lithography process optimization as the algorithms were limited to a few square micrometres of resist. Commercial full-chip optical proximity correction, using model forms, was first implemented by TMA (now a subsidiary of Synopsys) and Numerical Technologies (also part of Synopsys) around 1997. Since then the market and complexity has grown significantly. With the move to sub-wavelength lithography at the 180 nm and 130 nm nodes, RET techniques such as Assist features, Phase Shift Masks started to be used together with OPC. For the transition from 65 nm to 45 nm nodes customers were worrying that not only that design rules were insufficient to guarantee printing without yield limiting hotspots, but also that tape-out time may need thousands of CPUs or weeks of run time. This predicted exponential increase in computational complexity for mask synthesis on moving to the 45 nm process node spawned a significant venture capital investment in Design for Manufacturing start-up companies. A number of startup companies promoting their own disruptive solutions to this problem started to appear, techniques from custom hardware acceleration to radical new algorithms such as Inverse Lithography were touted to resolve the forthcoming bottlenecks. Despite all this activity, incumbent OPC suppliers were able to adapt and keep their major customers, with RET and OPC being used together as for previous nodes, but now on more layers and with larger data files, and turn around time concerns were met by new algorithms and improvements in multi-core commodity processors. The term computational lithography was first used by Brion Technology (now a subsidiary of ASML) in 2005 to promote their hardware accelerated full chip lithography simulation platform. Since then the term has been used by the industry to describe full chip mask synthesis solutions. As 45 nm goes into full production and <b>EUV</b> <b>lithography</b> introduction is delayed, 32 nm and 22 nm are expected to run on existing 193 nm scanners technology. Now, not only are throughput and capabilities concerns resurfacing, but also new computational lithography techniques such as Source Mask Optimization (SMO) is seen as a way to squeeze better resolution specific to a given design. Today, all the major Mask Synthesis vendors have settled on the term [...] "Computational Lithography" [...] to describe and promote the set of Mask Synthesis technologies required for 22 nm.|$|E

The working parameters of the source are optimized to achieve a required narrowband emission spectrum and to fulfill the necessary coherence and intensity requirements. The intense 4 f- 4 d transitions around 11 nm in a highly ionized (Xe 8 +-Xe 12 +) xenon plasma are chosen to provide the working wavelength. This allows us to increase the available radiation intensity in comparison with an in-band EUV xenon emission at 13. 5 nm and opens up the possibility to strongly suppress {{the influence of the}} 5 p- 4 d transitions at wavelengths between 12 and 16 nm utilizing a significant difference in conditions for optical thickness between 4 f- 4 d and 5 p- 4 d transitions. The effect is achieved by using the admixture of argon to the pinch plasma, which allows keeping the plasma parameters approximately constant while, at the same time, reducing the density of xenon emitters. It is demonstrated that with this approach it is possible to achieve a high intensity 11 nm EUV radiation with a bandwidth of 3 %- 4 % without the use of multilayer mirrors or other additional spectral filters {{in the vicinity of the}} working wavelength.

Apart from the very expensive synchrotron facilities, EUV sources for metrology are presently based on laser- or discharge-produced plasmas.
