500|$|Prior to {{his senior}} year, Jeff Barker of The Baltimore Sun noted that Turner's {{strengths}} were [...] "poise, smarts, [...] toughness," [...] {{while he had}} room for improvement in arm strength and mobility. Barker said, [...] "He's a bit streaky—he calls himself a 'rhythm' passer … But he doesn't quit when things go poorly. His coolness can be mistaken for apathy." [...] Turner typically confines himself to the pocket, as his ability to run the ball himself is limited by his speed. He has made light of his own lack of quickness by saying that <b>he</b> <b>runs</b> <b>a</b> [...] "flat 5.0"-second 40-yard dash. The CBS Sports-affiliated NFL Draft Scout records his actual time as ranging {{from a low of}} 4.89to a high of 5.16seconds, while Scout.com reports his 40-yard time as 4.8seconds. Turner's supposedly one-dimensional nature, however, has occasionally allowed him to make unexpected plays with his feet. The most noteworthy of these were the momentum-changing 41-yard option run against NC State in 2007, and the fourth-down nine-yard scramble into field goal range against North Carolina in 2008.|$|E

During his wedding toast, Roy stuns his lovely bride by performing [...] "She's Got a Way" [...] by Billy Joel on the piano, saying that {{he told her he}} was taking boxing lessons as a cover for learning some music for her instead. Pam and Jim, convinced they already know everything about one another but stunned by Roy's transformation, try to find things about themselves the other does not know. This is exacerbated by Jim's frequent calls about a new business he is starting with a friend, because Jim and Pam agreed that the venture was not right for them, but Jim then signed onto it without telling his wife he had done so. Pam tries unsuccessfully to bait Jim {{to find out what the}} secret is and becomes increasingly annoyed that her husband is lying to her.|$|E
500|$|Television critics {{tended to}} view [...] "Cocktails" [...] positively. Kevin Fitzpatrick of UGO Networks praised the episode's writing and directing, {{explaining}} that [...] " [...] {{of the credit}} goes to Paul Lieberstein for his ruthlessly funny writing, but ol' J.J. really knows how to run with the material and make awkward situations just that much more painful with his direction, {{one of the best}} episodes of the series." [...] Buddy TV writer Oscar Dahl noted that [...] "besides a couple of crafty camera moves, his work was mostly invisible, which is exactly what you want from a director on The Office." [...] IGN's Brian Zoromski appreciated the spotlight on female characters Jan, Pam, and Karen, and thought there were [...] "quite a few great little moments this episode," [...] including [...] "a great Creed moment as he revealed <b>he</b> <b>runs</b> <b>a</b> fake ID company out of his car." [...] Entertainment Weekly columnist Abby West enjoyed Karen conning Jim at the party, called Rashida Jones' performance [...] "brilliantly played"; West also liked Pam's newfound confidence, but believed she was [...] "dumb" [...] for telling Roy of her kiss with Jim.|$|E

SuperPrep named him an all-region player. Rivals.com rated him a four-star prospect and assessed him as the 21st-ranked [...] "athlete" [...] recruit in the nation. Scout.com assessed him as a three-star prospect, and wrote of him, [...] "This kid can flat out fly. <b>He</b> <b>runs</b> <b>a</b> sub 10.5 100 meters, and a sub 21.0 200 meters. Scott needs to get physically bigger to be a college running back; he may project better as a wide receiver or cornerback."

500|$|In the Japanese {{version of}} Fullmetal Alchemists anime adaptations, Edward has been voiced by Romi Park. In the English version, the role has been played by Vic Mignogna.

Additionally, in the upcoming live-action of the series, Edward will be portrayed by Ryosuke Yamada. Yamada thinks his short starture might be work as an advantage due to one of Edward's most common characteristics is his low height. Studying Arakawa's manga, Yamada tried imitating Edward's other signature actions such the way <b>he</b> <b>runs.</b> <b>A</b> fan of the series, the actor expressed happiness with the role he was given. Nevertheless, in Anime Expo 2017 if anything from him looked [...] "weird" [...] which resulted in praise from the audience.
