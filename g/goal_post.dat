5|$|Arsenal {{started the}} match through {{kick-off}} Henry. There {{minutes into the}} match, captain Tony Adams attempted to clear the ball via a header, only for it to land at Arif Erdem, who attempted a volley shot outside the Arsenal area, deflecting off the <b>goal</b> <b>post.</b> As a result, Galatasaray were awarded a corner. Erdem took it, but failed to trouble the defense, as the ball was easily cleared away. Arsenal responded via Bergkamp, who received the ball from Marc Overmars; Bergkamp attempted to outrun Galatasaray defenders Capone and Gheorghe Popescu and into their area, only to be unable to keep the ball in match play. Arsenal even fashioned more chances, as Overmars won a one-on-one encounter against Capone, trying to reach Bergkamp, but the ball was easily read by Popescu for a corner. The corner was came to nothing, as Patrick Vieira tried to hit the ball, before it landed for an opportunity for Henry, whose shot went over the <b>goal</b> <b>post.</b> A third of the match played, Arsenal were awarded a free-kick opportunity, after Okan Buruk received a yellow card for committing a sliding tackle on Vieira.|$|E
5|$|On 21 May 2010, Chamakh {{completed}} his move to Arsenal on a free transfer after completing {{his contract with}} Bordeaux. The transfer took effect on 1 July 2010. He made his debut in a pre-season friendly against Barnet on 17 July, appearing as a substitute. On 27 July, he scored his first pre-season goal for the club, converting a penalty in a 4–0 victory over Austrian club SC Neusiedl. In the 2010 edition of the Emirates Cup, Chamakh scored on his home debut against Italian club Milan. On 7 August 2010, he scored the first goal in 6-5 win against Legia Warsaw in a friendly match and the last match for pre-season. He made his Premier League debut on 15 August in the team's 1–1 draw with Liverpool. Chamakh contributed to the team's equalising goal by heading a cross off the <b>goal</b> <b>post,</b> which then redirected off goalkeeper Pepe Reina and {{into the back of}} the net, resulting in an own goal.|$|E
5|$|The {{second quarter}} began with Virginia Tech in {{possession}} of the ball at its 40-yard line and facing a third-and-four situation. On the first play of the quarter, Druckenmiller completed a pass to Holmes for 13 yards and a first down at the Texas 47-yard line. Once there, however, Druckenmiller threw a pass that bounced off a Tech receiver and was caught by Texas defender Jason Reeves, who returned it to the Tech 33-yard line. On the first play after the turnover, the Texas offense lost four yards on a rushing play that went out of bounds. Brown then completed a two-yard pass to Fitzgerald, setting up a long third-down play. The Longhorns were unable to earn a first down and sent in kicker Phil Dawson to attempt a 52-yard field goal. The kick attempt equaled his career long and grazed one of the uprights of the <b>goal</b> <b>post,</b> but the kick was successful and gave Texas a 100 lead with 13:19 remaining in the first half.|$|E

5|$|After {{holding out}} for 21 days, Davis was signed {{initially}} to a contract designed as a temporary compromise {{in order to get}} him into training camp on August 5, 1991. It was speculated that the reason behind Davis' holdout and the temporary compromise was that Davis and his agent wanted to see what McRae, who also held out with the Buccaneers, signed for first. Davis was not allowed to practice with the team until he was under contract, thus the compromise contract enabled him to practice while still work to get a long-term deal done. The compromise was a one-year contract with an option for a second year, and Davis received $600,000 in signing the first contract. He was able to play against the Cincinnati Bengals in the Eagles' third preseason game on August 10. Davis was projected to be the Eagles' starting right offensive tackle for the 1991 season. Davis suffered a sprained ankle while running laps around JFK Stadium and tripping over a <b>goal</b> <b>post</b> support on August 19. Due to the injury, he was taken out of the preseason game against the Indianapolis Colts on August 23 at halftime by Kotite. The Eagles and Davis finalized a five-year contract worth $4.6 million on September 6 following {{the first week of the}} season. Davis changed his jersey number from 77 to 78 after signing the contract. He had his best game of the season in week four against the Pittsburgh Steelers on September 22, as Kotite called more run plays to the right side towards the end of the game. Davis had a key block on a Jim McMahon quarterback sneak touchdown and McMahon gave Davis the ball immediately after to spike in celebration. The Eagles were given a five-yard penalty for the spike, however. In a week five game against the Washington Redskins on September 30, Davis gave up two sacks against defensive end Charles Mann, who received Pro Bowl honors after the season. Davis gave up a total of ten sacks in the first five games of the season.|$|E
25|$|Field goal {{attempts}} that {{bounce off}} the <b>goal</b> <b>post</b> are now reviewable under instant replay. This change followed a decision {{during the previous}} season during a Browns-Ravens game when Phil Dawson's game-tying field goal hit an upright and then the curved support behind the crossbar, and then again went over the crossbar to land {{in front of the}} <b>goal</b> <b>post.</b>|$|E
25|$|California Memorial Stadium is {{an outdoor}} {{football}} stadium {{on the campus}} of the University of California, Berkeley in Berkeley, California. Commonly known as Memorial Stadium, it is the home field for the University of California Golden Bears of the Pac-12 Conference. The venue opened in 1923 and currently seats around 63,000 fans for football. The playing field runs NW-SE, at an elevation of 410 feet (125 m) above sea level, and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on November 27, 2006. The stadium is located on the Hayward Fault, which passes directly under the playing field, nearly from <b>goal</b> <b>post</b> to <b>goal</b> <b>post.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Goal</b> <b>Posts</b> - <b>Goal</b> <b>posts</b> are 12 ft {{from the}} floor to the {{crossbar}}. The crossbar is 10 ft in width. Anything used to hang the goalpost is considered {{a part of the}} upright.|$|R
50|$|At {{the high}} school level, it is not {{uncommon}} to see multi-purpose <b>goal</b> <b>posts</b> that include football <b>goal</b> <b>posts</b> at the top and a soccer net at the bottom; these are usually seen at smaller schools and in multi-purpose stadiums where facilities are used for multiple sports. When these or H-shaped <b>goal</b> <b>posts</b> are used in football, the lower portions of the posts are covered with several inches of heavy foam padding to protect the safety of the players.|$|R
5000|$|If a ball caroms {{off one of}} the <b>goal</b> <b>posts</b> or the crossbar, but {{lands in}} the field of play, the ball is {{considered}} dead and cannot be returned. (This is not the case in arena football, where large [...] "rebound nets" [...] surround the <b>goal</b> <b>posts</b> for the explicit purpose of keeping the ball in play.) However, if the ball caroms {{off one of the}} <b>goal</b> <b>posts</b> or the crossbar and continues into the goal, the score counts.|$|R
25|$|In {{the current}} fast5 format, {{when a team}} uses it in a quarter, all goals scored by that team are worth twice as normal. A shooter that scores a goal within 3.5 meters from the <b>goal</b> <b>post</b> scores two points instead of one. Four points (instead of two) if the goal was scored at least 3.5 meters away from the <b>goal</b> <b>post</b> but within the goal circle. If the goal was scored from outside of the goal circle (known as a super goal), six points is scored instead of three. The winner of the coin toss chooses which quarter to have this power play and the other team must choose a {{different}} quarter for their power play. This prevents both teams from having their power plays in the same quarter.|$|E
25|$|A behind, worth 1 point, is scored {{when the}} ball passes between a <b>goal</b> <b>post</b> and a behind post at any height, or if the ball hits a <b>goal</b> <b>post,</b> or if any player sends the ball between the goal posts by {{touching}} it with {{any part of the}} body other than a foot. A behind is also awarded to the attacking team if the ball touches any part of an opposition player, including his foot, before passing between the goal posts. When an opposition player deliberately scores a behind for the attacking team (generally as a last resort to ensure that a goal is not scored) this is termed a rushed behind. As of the 2009 AFL season, a free kick is awarded against any player who deliberately rushes a behind.|$|E
25|$|The team's {{official}} mascot is a Bengal tiger named Who Dey {{who walks}} {{around on the}} field often behind the <b>goal</b> <b>post.</b> Aside from Who Dey, the team also has the Cincinnati Ben–Gals, the team's cheerleading squad, which included Laura Vikmanis, the oldest cheerleader in league history.|$|E

25|$|Vanderbilt's only {{noteworthy}} offensive play came soon after. Vanderbilt punted out of {{the shadow}} of its <b>goal</b> <b>post</b> after the goal line stand, and Jess Neely tackled Kipke, or Irwin Uteritz, hard on the punt return, causing a fumble which Neely recovered. Neely then connected on a pass to Tot McCullough, Vanderbilt's lone offensive highlight on the day. This gave Vanderbilt the ball at Michigan's 20-yard line, but the subsequent plays for Vanderbilt saw runs stopped for little gain and a pass intercepted by Uteritz.|$|E
25|$|He {{would run}} towards {{the corner and}} then swiftly turn inwards, running {{parallel}} to the back line, and some ten yards from it. At this point he was pursued probably by three of the opponents, barely keeping up. This continued till he got opposite the further <b>goal</b> <b>post,</b> and then one huge foot was smartly dropped on the ball, stopping it dead, {{and of course the}} pursuers all ran a yard or so too far, not suspecting the sudden pull up; thus he had a clear shot at the goal.|$|E
25|$|The {{franchise}} suspended {{operations and}} sat out the 1943 {{season because of}} a shortage of players during World War II and resumed playing in 1944. The team finally achieved success in 1945, which proved to be their last season in Ohio. Quarterback Bob Waterfield, a rookie from UCLA, passed, ran, and place-kicked {{his way to the}} league's Most Valuable Player award and helped the Rams achieve a 9–1 record and winning their first NFL Championship, a 15–14 home field victory over the Washington Redskins on December 16. The victory was provided by a safety: Redskins great Sammy Baugh's pass bounced off the <b>goal</b> <b>post,</b> then backward, through his team's own end zone. The next season, NFL rules were changed to prevent this from ever again resulting in a score; instead, it would merely result in an incomplete pass.|$|E

25|$|A {{controversial}} {{instance of}} misconduct occurred during extra {{time in the}} second leg of the two-legged tie, when the overall score was standing at 1–1 on aggregate. French player Florent Malouda took a free kick just outside the centre circle in the Irish half of the field. He lofted it toward French captain Thierry Henry, who was making a run in the penalty area to Irish goalkeeper Shay Given's right-hand side. The ball bounced once to Henry, now inside the goal area {{to the left of}} the goal. As it bounced upwards, Henry handled the ball twice with his left hand, stopping it going out of play and bringing the ball under control, before tapping the ball with the outside of his right foot past Given standing at the near <b>goal</b> <b>post.</b> The ball travelled the short distance to William Gallas arriving in the middle of the goal, who headed the ball into the Irish net to confirm France's place at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.|$|E
25|$|Oklahoma State {{began the}} second half with the ball. The Cowboys managed to get to Oklahoma's 23yard line but {{had to settle for}} a field goal attempt. The 40yard attempt by Dan Bailey hit the <b>goal</b> <b>post</b> and bounced to the ground. The Sooner's next {{possession}} saw Bradford make an uncharacteristic mistake. Bradford's pass was intercepted and returned 23yards to Oklahoma's one-yard line. The defense was unable to stop this one. After being set back fiveyards on a penalty, Savage rushed up the middle on the first play to get the touchdown and put the Cowboys within 11points halfway through the third quarter. But the Oklahoma defense did not allow an Oklahoma State first down {{for the rest of the}} game. The Sooners, meanwhile, went on to score three more touchdowns on their next three possessions. The Sooners received the ball for the last time with 5:37 left on the clock but drained the clock, ending the game with a final score of 49–17 in favor of the Sooners.|$|E
25|$|After a “hand” within thirty {{yards of}} the Wanderers’ lines, Weir got possession, and, {{successfully}} charging the English forwards, {{passed it on to}} Herriot, who in turn placed it to Campbell, who by a well judged kick dropped the ball just below the bar, thus securing another goal for the Scotsmen in sixteen minutes. No sooner had the English captain started the ball than Herriot, Weir and Lawrie, by neat passing sent it back, and after the backs and half backs had shown good play, the two M'Neills brought it along the left side, and passing it to Lawrie, the latter made a shot for goal, but the ball passed just outside the <b>goal</b> <b>post.</b> The play was now in the centre, the Queen’s Park men dribbling and passing, while their opponents indulged chiefly in heavy kicking. In 33 minutes from the commencement of operations H. M'Neill, obtaining possession, kicked the ball to Herriot, who unselfishly serving it to Lawrie, the latter again made a shot for goal, this time with more success, as the ball, passing above the goalkeeper’s head, went clean through thus obtaining the third goal.|$|E

25|$|Like {{many other}} codes of football, {{the way to}} score points is to score goals. In Australian Football, {{there are two types}} of scores: a goal and a behind. There are four posts at each end of the ground; the two middle (and taller) posts are the goal posts, and the two outer (and shorter) posts are the behind posts. The area between the goal posts is the goal; kicking the ball between these posts scores a goal which is worth six points. Kicking the ball between a goal and a behind post scores a behind, which {{constitutes}} a single point. A behind is also scored if the ball passes between the goal posts but has not been kicked by the attacking team (e.g., it comes off the hands of either team, or is kicked by the defending team), or if the ball hits or passes directly above the <b>goal</b> <b>post.</b> (If the ball hits the behind post, the ball is considered to have gone out of bounds.) A rushed behind (also worth one point) is scored when the defending team deliberately forces the ball between any of the posts. This may occur in pressure situations where a defender decides that it is safer to concede one point to the opposing team rather than risk a goal being scored.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{inconsistencies}} in Hawkin's form, he played twenty-four matches for the 2009 season including the grand final, {{where he played}} alongside other father-son selections, Gary Ablett, Matthew Scarlett and Mark Blake. He scored two goals in the game to help Geelong defeat [...] by twelve points, winning the 2009 AFL premiership. One of his goals was notably controversial, as it was later ruled it had hit the <b>goal</b> <b>post,</b> which should have been registered as a behind; {{this was one of}} the reasons behind the introduction of the goal review system implemented by the AFL during the 2012 season.|$|E
500|$|After the 2004–05 lockout {{and before}} the start of the 2005–06 season, the league instituted a new rule {{preventing}} goaltenders from playing the puck behind the goal line, except within a trapezoid-shaped zone located behind the net. The trapezoid began at the goal line with angled lines six feet from each <b>goal</b> <b>post</b> and widened to 28 feet at the end boards. Former Flyers general manager Bobby Clarke was one of the leaders in getting the trapezoid implemented. This was viewed by many as singling out Brodeur, who was one of the best at getting behind the net to handle the puck, and has come to be known as the [...] "Brodeur Rule".|$|E
