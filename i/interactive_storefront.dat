40|$|We {{describe}} a novel interface that locates and characterizes knocks and taps atop a large glass window. Our current setup uses four contact piezoelectric pickups {{located near the}} sheet's corners to record the acoustic wavefront coming from the knocks. A digital signal processor extracts relevant characteristics from these signals, such as amplitudes, frequency components, and differential timings, which are used to estimate {{the location of the}} hit and provide other parameters, including the rough accuracy of this estimate, the nature of each hit (e. g., knuckle knock, metal tap, or fist bang), and the strike intensity. This system requires only simple hardware, needs no special adaptation of the glass pane, and allows all transducers to be mounted on the inner surface, hence it is quite easy to deploy as a retrofit to existing windows. This opens many applications, such as an <b>interactive</b> <b>storefront,</b> with projected content controlled by knocks on the display window...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a system that}} locates and characterizes knocks and taps atop a large sheet of glass using four contact piezoelectric pickups located near the sheet's corners to simultaneously record the structural-acoustic wavefront coming from the impacts. A digital signal processor extracts relevant characteristics from these signals, such as amplitudes, frequency components, and differential timings, which are used to estimate {{the location of the}} hit and provide other parameters, including a degree of confidence in the position accuracy, the nature of each hit (e. g., knuckle knock, metal tap, or fist bang – our system responds to any kind of impact), and the strike intensity. As this system requires only simple hardware, it needs no special adaptation of the glass pane, and allows all tracking transducers to be mounted on the inner surface, hence it is quite easy and inexpensive to deploy as a retrofit to existing windows. This opens many applications, such as an <b>interactive</b> <b>storefront,</b> with content controlled by knocks on the display window...|$|E
40|$|Although {{previous}} studies identified {{the importance of}} storefront windows on consumer’s entry decision, {{there is still a}} lack of research on engaging consumers at the storefront through the integration with interactive technologies. The {{purpose of this study is}} to carry out an exploratory investigation into the consumers preference for a certain store based on the storefront windows (in terms of entry decision), with emphasis on the current most attractive interactive technologies. Thus, we examine the extent to which an exploratory sample of consumers is influenced by <b>storefront</b> <b>interactive</b> technologies. Emotional aspects emerge as the most influencing ones in the case of traditional storefronts, while both emotional and functional aspects emerge as the most influencing factors while considering the integration of interactive technologies. In particular, our results shed light on the way these elements can be managed for the design of future attractive storefront windows, by providing important insights for scholars and practitioners...|$|R
