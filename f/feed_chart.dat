40|$|In {{response}} to my poor system of keeping records, I decided to create a software program that would enable me to keep better records pertaining to equine information. My objective was to design a program that simplified the record keeping system. I wanted a system that was easy and fun to use. eHorseTraxx is the result. Within the program, the user will find an easy-to-use interface. The software enables the user to enter, save, change, view, and print records. A weight calculator, a <b>feed</b> <b>chart,</b> and a worming chart are incorporated in the application to add to its convenience. Additionally, a user's manual is included to help the user {{become familiar with the}} eHorseTraxx program. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|E

40|$|Indiana University Purdue University IndianapolisThe goal of {{this project}} is to design and {{construct}} a hydroponic control system. The control system will process signals from the required inputs and control output devices based on operational criteria. The control system will display the amounts of water and nutrients {{that need to be}} added on a daily basis to maintain a proper growing environment. A daily chemical test is required so these readings can be obtained. The desired nutritional specs are provided by Emerald Harvest Nutrient Series <b>Feeding</b> <b>Chart.</b> The system consist of 3 chemicals, Grow, Bloom, and Micro. The ratios of these 3 chemicals change on a weekly basis during the 16 week grow cycle. The system will continuously monitor the humidity of the grow area and cycle a humidifier to maintain the area within certain specs. Since the system is designed to be indoors, a way to control temperature is not needed. The grow lights are designed to supplement natural light and therefore the system needed to be placed near a south facing window. With minimal user interaction, the system should be able to provide adequate grow environment for up to 5 small herbs over an entire grow cycle. After a grow cycle is complete, the system is ready to start all over again. Electrical Engineering Technolog...|$|R

40|$|The {{project was}} an oral feeding {{practice}} change from traditional, gestational-age/volume-driven feeding progression to developmentally-based, infant-driven feeding progression. The infant-driven (cue-based) feeding protocol was implemented with goals to improve premature infants 2 ̆ 7 feeding outcomes, and decreased the infant 2 ̆ 7 s length of hospitalization. The project {{was designed to}} implement a cue-based feeding protocol for oral feeding initiation and progression, within the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at Community Regional Medical Center (CRMC), and then retrospectively evaluate {{the impact of the}} cue-based feeding protocol on feeding outcomes. In order to realize full implementation of a NICU feeding practice change, multiple components, such as electronic <b>charting,</b> <b>feeding</b> policy, staff education and data reports, needed to be developed. Multiple unit- and hospital-level barriers prevented timely project implementation. Given the DNP program time constraints for project implementation, and the complex nature of project review and approval by nursing leadership, final, post-protocol data collection and analysis could not be completed. Delays in project implementation did not allow for oral feeding outcome evaluation, as originally proposed, however, the project did produce valuable instruments for recording and measuring feeding outcomes in the future. Future plans for project follow-up have been established by NICU nursing leadership. Data for 6 -month and 1 -year feeding outcomes will be collected and evaluated, with the intention to present results to: 1) CRMC corporate leadership, 2) CPQCC 1 -year collaborative follow-up (June 2014); and 3) Central Valley Nursing Research Conference 2015...|$|R

INTRODUCTION: Since {{the start}} of the Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT) Programme at Dr George Mukhari Hospital in 2001, there has been no {{evaluation}} of the effect of formula feeding on the growth and dietary intakes of enrolled infants. AIM: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the short-term growth, anthropometry and dietary intake of infants from two to ten weeks of age were entered into the PMTCT Programme at the Department of Human Nutrition at Dr George Mukhari Hospital from two to ten weeks of age. METHODS: This was a descriptive, longitudinal (eight weeks duration) study. Anthropometric assessment including length and head circumference was performed at two weeks of age and thereafter at ten weeks of age. Weight measurement was performed at age two weeks (visit 1), six weeks (visit 2) and ten weeks (visit 3). Anthropometric measurements were compared with CDC 20003 growth <b>charts.</b> <b>Feeding</b> practices and dietary intake (24 hour diet recall interview) were assessed at each of the four week interval visits and evaluated according to the DRIs 59. At the third visit, a socio-demographic interview and a usual food intake interview were performed. RESULTS: A total of 151 [male (N = 75) and female (N = 76) ] infants completed the study. A total of 110 (72 %) mothers resided in the Soshanguve area and 138 (91 %) of the mothers had attended high school. The majority (75 %) of mothers was not generating an income from employment. Generally, mothers had access to safe drinking water and all (99 %) but two mothers used pre-boiled water before preparing infant formula. The accuracy and correctness of reconstituting infant formula decreased with each visit as feeds were increasingly made too dilute. A total of 124 (82 %) infants were exclusively formula fed. The remainder received water, water with sugar and/or complementary feeds. Mean energy and macronutrient intakes of both males (N = 65, 87 %) and females (N = 61, 80 %) were below recommendations at age two weeks. Of all the macronutrients, fats were consumed the least by both males (N = 67, 89 %) and females (N = 66, 87 %) at visit 1. Catch up growth was evident and nutrient intakes improved as the study progressed. The mean weight gain of all infants from visit 1 to 2 was 1. 2 (SD 0. 3) kg and 0. 9 (SD 0. 3) kg from visit 2 to 3 (exceeding the CDC 20003 recommendation for both male and female infants). The incidence of underweight, wasting and head circumference-for-age below the third percentile decreased from visit 1 to 3, but the number of stunted infants increased towards visit 3. The majority of infants in this study grew well in their first ten weeks of life. Growth accelerated as infants became older and growth faltering improved by ten weeks of age. CONCLUSION: Overall, the growth of the infants referred to the PMTCT Programme at the Department of Human Nutrition at Dr George Mukhari Hospital would appear to be adequate but mothers’ approach to formula feeding practices needs to be improved in some aspects of feeding their infants...|$|R

Overweight and obesity resulting in preschool are difficult to reverse, and are associated with many serious health complications and increased risk of premature illness and death in adulthood. Few of the existing publication evaluates daily food rations preschool children. Aim of the study. Evaluation of nutrition of children of preschool age in terms of demand for energy and macronutrient intake in children of normal BMI and overweight children and obesity. Material and methods. The analysis included 102 children. Nutritional status was assessed on the basis of anthropometric characteristics and indicators in relation to the WHO centile <b>charts.</b> <b>Feeding</b> analyzed on the basis of average daily intake, calculated as the mean of the 3 -day storage menus. Estimation of the nutrient content in the children’s diet was carried out using diet 5. The analysis used statistical package STATISTICA 12. 0. Results. BMI correct in 83 % of subjects, and 16 % of excess body weight were observed. With regard to the energy and nutritional average daily food rations showed no statistically significant differences between the group of children with normal BMI and a group of children with overweight and obesity. The supply of energy and macronutrients in average daily diet of children deviated from the recommended standards among both groups of children studied. Conclusions. The results showed a number of deficiencies in the nutrition of preschool children. Intake of nutrients in daily food rations differ from dietary recommendations for this age group. It is necessary to educate parents on the proper nutrition of children. Keywords: preschool children, nutrition assessment, normal BMI, overweight...|$|R
