5|$|During Season 5, it is {{revealed}} that Wilson's homeless brother Danny suffered from schizophrenia since adolescence, {{which is what}} caused him to run away. Wilson blames himself for his brother's homelessness, having <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> Danny right before he disappeared. Wilson also reveals to House that he took the position at Princeton-Plainsboro because it was near the place he had last seen Danny. When Wilson finds out that Danny is in the Psychiatric Ward of New York Mercy Hospital , House offers to come with him to keep him company, noting that it could end badly. However, when Wilson is let in to see his brother, House is busy with a differential with his team.|$|E
5|$|On 3 March, Harclay was arraigned {{before a}} royal justice in Carlisle, but was denied a proper hearing. He was brought forward apparelled in his robes of estate as a knight and earl. His spurs of knighthood were hewed off, and his sword was broken over his head. He was {{stripped}} of his robes, and proclaimed to be no knight, but a knave. He was then convicted as a traitor, and condemned to be hanged, drawn and quartered. He behaved with dignity at his execution, where he maintained that he had acted as he did {{out of concern for}} {{the best interest of the}} country. After his death, his head was taken to the king at Knaresborough in Yorkshire, before it was <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> London Bridge. The four parts of his body were dispersed around the country, and displayed in Carlisle, Newcastle, Bristol, and Dover.|$|E
5|$|On the eastern-most beach, Fox Green, {{elements}} of five different companies had become entangled, {{and the situation}} was little improved by the equally disorganized landings of the second wave. Two more companies of the 3rd Battalion joined the melee, and, having drifted east in the first wave, I/16 finally made their traumatic landing on Fox Green, at 08:00. Two of their six boats were swamped on their detour to the east, and as they came in under fire, {{three of the four}} remaining boats were damaged by artillery or mines, and the fourth was <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> an obstacle. A captain from this company found himself senior officer, and in charge of the badly out of shape 3rd Battalion.|$|E

5|$|At {{the house}} of Will's friends Max and Bella, Anna fits in {{perfectly}} as they all share stories. Honey immediately recognizes Anna and declares them best friends instantly. She and Will share a private moment in a garden square as they walk back from the birthday party. The following evening {{they go to a}} restaurant, where Will overhears a group of patrons making crude remarks about Anna and attempts to defend her, before Anna steps in herself and humiliates them. As they walk back to her hotel, she invites Will up to her room. But when he arrives, she tells him he must leave immediately. Her American movie star boyfriend (who was never mentioned until now) appears and starts to bark orders at him, as well as make unflattering comments about Anna's weight. Anna is apologetic and embarrassed, while a stunned Will leaves. Over the next six months, Max and Bella set Will up on a series of blind dates, trying to help him move on; however Will, still <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> Anna, does not connect with any of them.|$|E
5|$|The White House Chief of Staff, Donald Regan, grew {{frustrated}} with this regimen, which created friction {{between him and}} the First Lady. This escalated with the revelation of the Iran–Contra affair, an administration scandal, in which the First Lady felt Regan was damaging the president. She thought he should resign, and expressed this to her husband, although he did not share her view. Regan wanted President Reagan to address the Iran-Contra matter in early 1987 by means of a press conference, though Reagan refused to allow her husband to overexert himself due to a recent prostate surgery and astrological warnings. Regan became so angry with Reagan that he <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> her during a 1987 telephone conversation. According to the recollections of ABC News correspondent Sam Donaldson, when the President heard of this treatment, he demanded—and eventually received—Regan's resignation. Vice President George H. W. Bush is also reported to have suggested to Reagan to have Regan fired.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after Carson's {{death in}} 2005, Rivers {{said that he}} had never spoken to her again. In 2008, during an {{interview}} with Dr. Pamela Connolly on television's Shrink Rap, Rivers claimed she did call Carson, but he <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> her at once and repeated the gesture when she called again.|$|E
60|$|Almost {{every one}} in that pasture, save {{possibly}} the performers themselves, was astonished at the din made {{by these two}} small boys; and Mr. Stubbs's brother, who had <b>hung</b> himself <b>up</b> <b>on</b> a tree by his tail, dropped to his feet in the greatest alarm, adding his chatter of fear to the general confusion.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure," [...] replied Jack, readily enough, {{and he got}} up. Wade led the pack-horse to {{the door}} of the store-cabin, which stood back of the kitchen and was joined to it by a roof.

25|$|Abraham Lincoln's patent is {{a patent}} for an {{invention}} to lift boats over shoals and obstructions in a river. It {{is the only}} United States patent ever registered to a President of the United States. Lincoln conceived the idea of inventing a mechanism that would lift a boat over shoals and obstructions when on two different occasions the boat on which he traveled got <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> obstructions. Documentation of this patent was discovered in 1997.|$|E
25|$|The {{hands and}} facial {{features}} of the groundbreaking animatronic puppets in the film were controlled with relatively primitive rods and cables, although radio control later took over many of the subtler movements. Human performers inside the puppets supplied basic movement for the larger creatures, which in some cases was dangerous or exhausting; for example, the Garthim costumes were so heavy that the performers had to be <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> a rack every few minutes to rest while still inside the costumes. A mime from Switzerland was hired to help choreograph {{the movements of the}} puppeteers.|$|E
25|$|On June 13, 2006, Vincent Ferrari {{documented}} {{his account}} cancellation phone {{call in a}} blog post, stating he had switched to broadband years earlier. In the recorded phone call, the AOL representative refused to cancel the account unless the 30-year-old Ferrari explained why AOL hours were still being recorded on it. Ferrari insisted that AOL software was not even installed on the computer. When Ferrari demanded that the account be canceled regardless, the AOL representative asked to speak with Ferrari's father, for whom the account had been set up. The conversation was aired on CNBC. When CNBC reporters tried to have an account on AOL cancelled, they were <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> immediately and it ultimately took more than 45 minutes to cancel the account.|$|E

25|$|Mussolini's death: On 25 April 1945, Italian partisans liberated Milan and Turin. On 27 April 1945, as Allied forces {{closed in}} on Milan, Italian {{dictator}} Benito Mussolini was captured by Italian partisans. It is disputed whether {{he was trying to}} flee from Italy to Switzerland (through the Splügen Pass), and was traveling with a German anti-aircraft battalion. On 28 April, Mussolini was executed in Giulino (a civil parish of Mezzegra); the other Fascists captured with him were taken to Dongo and executed there. The bodies were then taken to Milan and <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the Piazzale Loreto of the city. On 29 April, Rodolfo Graziani surrendered all Fascist Italian armed forces at Caserta. This included Army Group Liguria. Graziani was the Minister of Defence for Mussolini's Italian Social Republic.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{improvements}} The Book of Air has over its predecessors is a system of hints for locating difficult items. Although {{it is still possible}} to get <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> some of the game's more taxing brainteasers, players will no longer find themselves stuck trying to find items thanks to a recharging magnifying glass 'hint power' {{that can be used to}} reveal an object's location. But if there are not any, the power of hints is not used. There are two difficulty modes to play, Casual and Challenge. Each mode has the same puzzles but their complexities are different. At the beginning, the game offers players the option to play in either Casual or Challenge Mode, and if they want the game to offer the slightest bit of resistance they would pick the former. While Casual Mode offers simpler puzzles and the ability to skip them if players get stuck long enough, Challenge Mode offers slightly harder puzzles, but will not let players skip any. Players cannot change the difficulty once they have chosen it.|$|E
25|$|Ann {{breaks up}} with Andy and begins dating Mark, with Leslie's approval. It is {{revealed}} that Tom's marriage to pediatric surgeon Wendy (Jama Williamson) {{is actually a}} green card marriage (she is a Canadian illegally in the United States), which, to his disappointment, eventually ends in divorce. The pit is eventually filled in, after which Ron is visited by his horrible ex-wife Tammy Two (Megan Mullally), a librarian who unsuccessfully tries seducing him into allowing a branch library to be built on the filled-in lot. April becomes attracted to Andy, but he remains fixated on Ann. Just as Mark plans to propose to Ann, she reveals she no longer has feelings for him. They break up, and Mark leaves his city hall career for a private sector job (he never appears again on the show). Meanwhile, a crippling budget deficit leads state auditors Chris Traeger (Rob Lowe) and Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott) {{to shut down the}} Pawnee government temporarily, much to Leslie's horror and Ron's delight. Meanwhile, Andy develops feelings for April, but she fears he is still <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> Ann. Ann later kisses Andy due to conflicting emotions from her break-up with Mark, prompting April to reject Andy angrily. The season ends with Tom's shocked discovery that Ron is now dating his ex-wife, Wendy.|$|E

50|$|On October 5, 2007 a white Lincoln Continental {{was found}} burning {{in a field}} in Topeka, Kansas. A body was found inside, {{severely}} burned. A week later it {{was determined to be}} the remains of Edwyn Owen. The Kansas state Fire Marshall's Office determined that the car's heated catalytic converter set fire to the dense dry grass around the vehicle. Only later was Owen's increasingly bizarre behavior reported. He <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> abruptly <b>on</b> the phone with old friends, left rambling telephone messages and claimed he was a character in a fictional children's book.|$|R
25|$|Invasion by sea {{is the use}} of a body {{of water}} to {{facilitate}} the entry of armed forces into an area, often a landmass adjoining the body of water or an island. This is generally used either in conjunction with another method of invasion, and especially before the invention of flight, for cases {{in which there is no}} other method to enter the territory in question. Arguments in favor of this method usually consist of the ability to perform a surprise attack from sea, or that naval defenses of the area in question are inadequate to repel such an attack. However, the large amount of specialized equipment, such as amphibious vehicles and the difficulty of establishing defenses—usually with a resulting high casualty count—in exchange for a relatively small gain, are often used as arguments against such an invasion method. Underwater hazards and a lack of good cover are very common problems during invasions from the sea. At the Battle of Tarawa, Marine landing craft became <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> a coral reef and were shelled from the beach. Other landers were sunk before they could reach the shore, and the tanks they were carrying were stranded in the water. Most of the few survivors of the first wave ended up pinned down on the beach. The island was conquered but at a heavy cost, and the loss of life sparked mass protests from civilians in the United States.|$|E
25|$|In 1986 {{came the}} move that ended Rivers' {{longtime}} friendship with Johnny Carson, who had first hired {{her as a}} Tonight Show writer. The soon-to-launch Fox Television Network {{announced that it was}} giving her a late night talk show, The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers, making Rivers the first woman to have her own late night talk show on a major network. The new network planned to broadcast the show 11 p.m. to 12 a.m. Eastern Time, making her a Carson competitor. Carson learned of the show from Fox and not from Rivers. In the documentary, Johnny Carson: King of Late Night, Rivers said she only called Carson to discuss the matter after learning he may have already heard about it and that he immediately <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> her. In the same interview, she said that she later came to believe that maybe she should have asked for his blessing before taking the job. Rivers was banned from appearing on the Tonight Show, a decision respected by Carson's first two successors Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien. After the release of his 2013 biography on Johnny Carson, Carson's attorney Henry Bushkin revealed that he never received a call from Rivers' husband Edgar concerning the move to Fox, contrary to what Edgar had told Rivers. Rivers did not appear on the Tonight Show again until February 17, 2014, when she made a brief appearance on new host Jimmy Fallon's first episode. On March 27, 2014, Rivers returned for an interview.|$|E
500|$|A main theme {{found in}} Belenggu, {{reflected}} in the title, is if one is [...] "shackled" [...] to the past, then one cannot flourish; Taum notes that this is reflected in Hartono's dialogue to Tini, as follows: [...] "Mengapa tidak? Mengapa bergantung kepada zaman dahulu? ... Jangan dibesar-besarkan, jangan persusah perkara mudah, nanti pikiran sebagai dibelenggu. ... Lupakanlah, matikanlah angan-angan. Lepaskanlah belenggu ini.

50|$|Prior to the {{widespread}} availability of mains electricity and freezers, meat was preserved by heavy salting. Hogs were slaughtered after {{the onset of}} cold weather, and hams and other pork products were salted and <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> or placed <b>on</b> a shelf to last into the following summer. Whether the meat should be smoked as well as salted is personal preference, frequently backed up with strong local or family custom.|$|R

The body was neither in the bay below nor <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> anywhere <b>on</b> the cliff. One of two things, then, must have happened. Either Palliser's body must have been taken out by the tide, which flows down the Bristol Channel in a curious way, and will never now be recovered, or he made a remarkable escape and decided, under all the circumstances, to make a fresh start in life." ...|$|R

500|$|Alderman Tillman {{threatened}} {{to burn the}} painting in President Jones' office, but a Chicago Police Department (CPD) lieutenant present with the aldermen, Lt.

Patterson overrode this direct order, citing his own powers as the lieutenant {{on the scene and}} <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> Martin. A CPD sergeant accompanied Rush, Streeter and Tillman to a waiting police car with the wrapped painting in hand. Parts of the incident were later broadcast on television.|$|E

And when he got there he <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> the robes <b>on</b> the wall, and lay down to sleep.|$|R
