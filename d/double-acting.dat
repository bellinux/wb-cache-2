5|$|All six {{ships were}} {{intended}} to use two sets of Brown, Boveri, & Co. and Wagner turbines or Marine-type turbines built by Germaniawerft and four MAN <b>double-acting</b> 12-cylinder two-stroke diesels. Q and R however, was equipped with an additional four diesels, {{for a total of}} eight. The turbines were powered by four Wagner ultra-high pressure boilers, designed to put out 58 atmospheres of pressure. The propulsion system drove three screws, although four were considered for Q and R. The ships' electrical power was supplied by four generators that produced 2,400kW at 220volts.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{had first}} begun to {{consider}} the potential applications of steam power for transportation while still an apprentice in the 1780s, and had developed rudimentary designs for 'steam carriages' in the 1790s. In 1801, Evans definitively began work on making his long-held dream of a steam carriage into reality. Early steam engineers, most notably Watt contemporary William Murdoch, had developed plans for a steam-propelled carriage incorporating a heavy flywheel, in which pressure was converted directly to rotary power, however it became apparent in experimentation that a low-pressure, rotary steam engine would never be powerful enough to propel a carriage of any weight forward. Evans's attention thus turned to a reciprocating engine, not only for his steam carriage ideas, but also for industrial application. Importantly, Evans became an early proponent of 'strong steam' or high-pressure engines, an idea long resisted by Watt and earlier steam pioneers because the necessary iron making and metal working technology was lacking. Evans recognized that a high-pressure steam engine would be essential {{to the development of}} a steam carriage because they could be built far smaller while providing similar or greater power outputs to low-pressure equivalents. Some experiments with high-pressure steam engines had been made in Europe, most notably an unsuccessful steam tractor developed by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot. However the prevailing fear of early steam engineering was that no boiler could safely contain high-pressure steam. Evans ignored potential drawbacks, and developed radically different designs which called for engines operating at high-pressure and the elimination of the condenser—a central component of conventional designs. His designs also incorporated a grasshopper beam, a <b>double-acting</b> cylinder, and four steam valves. Each valve was independently operated by one of four cams. The resulting design was a high-pressure steam engine that had a higher power-to-weight ratio that prevailing designs, making locomotives and steamboats practical. It was also mechanically simpler than condensing engines, making it less costly to build and maintain, and did not require large volumes of condensing water. These features would make it similarly suited for a variety of industrial applications.|$|E

25|$|Empire Abercorn had an eight-cylinder, two-cycle <b>double-acting</b> {{diesel engine}} built by Harland & Wolff. It {{produced}} 7,500hp at 115 rpm. Normal operating speed about 101.2 rpm, giving a fuel consumption of 28 tons per day.|$|E
25|$|In 1846 the {{original}} 1809 engine {{was replaced by}} a new engine supplied by Harvey and Co. and built as a <b>double-acting</b> Sims patent combined cylinder engine. However this engine proved troublesome and eventually fell into disuse.|$|E
25|$|At the {{southern}} extremity of the drainage district lies Sutton St Edmund. Its commons were enclosed in 1797, and an Act of Parliament was obtained to drain them in 1809. The first recorded steam-powered pumping {{station in the}} Fens was erected there in 1817, to pump water into the South Holland Main Drain. It was a <b>double-acting</b> machine, of , but was removed in 1834/5, when the North Level Main Drain was constructed {{and it was no}} longer needed.|$|E
25|$|Number 2 engine, {{built by}} Harvey and Co. of Hayle in 1846 as a <b>double-acting</b> Sims patent {{combined}} cylinder engine and rebuilt in 1903 to a Cornish Engine, is a single-acting, condensing engine with a bore of 42 inches (1067mm), {{a stroke of}} 7 feet 8 inches (2337mm) and indicated power of 42 horsepower (31kW). It drives a 30-inch (762mm) force pump capable of lifting 2235 pounds (1014kg), or approximately one ton of water, per stroke, {{at a rate of}} 10.2 strokes a minute.|$|E
25|$|Each {{of the two}} {{new ships}} was powered {{by a pair of}} eight-cylinder {{four-stroke}} <b>double-acting</b> diesel engines built by Harland and Wolff to a Burmeister & Wain design. The engines gave each ship 10,000 ihp or 7,500 bhp, and at the time they were the World's largest motor ships. However, their cruising speed was only , which was less than that of competing ships already on the route between European ports and the South American east coast. This was an embarrassment for Lord Kylsant, who in 1924 had become Chairman of Harland and Wolff in addition to his position as chairman of RMSP.|$|E
25|$|The {{lifeboats}} {{were intended}} to be launched from davits supplied by the Welin Davit & Engineering Company of London. All lifeboats but the collapsibles were slung from the davits, ready to be launched. The davits were of a highly efficient <b>double-acting</b> quadrant design, capable of being slung inboard (hanging over the deck) as well as outboard (hanging over the side) to pick up additional lifeboats. The davits aboard Titanic were capable of accommodating 64 lifeboats, though only 16 were actually fitted to them. The collapsibles were also intended to be launched via the davits. Each davit was doubled up, supporting the forward arm of one boat and the after arm of the next one along. A bitt and sheave was located at the keel of each davit to facilitate the lowering of boats, and the falls could be taken across the deck so {{that a number of}} men could work simultaneously on each boat and davit. They had to be lowered by hand, ideally by a team of between eight and ten men. Despite Titanic having a number of electric winches, they could only have been used to winch the lifeboats back out of the water.|$|E

500|$|The Wujing Zongyao {{describes}} a flamethrower with a <b>double-acting</b> two-piston cylinder-pump capable of shooting a continuous blast of flame. The first Chinese battle {{to use the}} double-piston pump flamethrower was the Battle of Langshan Jiang in 919 AD. In the Battle of Langshan Jiang (Wolf Mountain River, 狼山江), the naval fleet of the Wenmu King of Wuyue defeated the fleet of the Kingdom of Wu because he had used 'fire oil' (huo yóu, 火油) to burn his fleet; this signified the first Chinese use of gunpowder in warfare, since a slow-burning match fuse was required to ignite the flames. Greek fire is likely based on distilled petroleum and is a weapon of Byzantine origin. The Chinese author Lin Yu explained in his book of 919 AD that Greek fire was acquired from their Arab maritime trade contacts in the Indian Ocean. Furthermore, the Chinese had been using the piston syringe since the Han Dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD). However, it was the later Wujing Zongyao that would provide the first illustrated drawing and greater textual explanation for how this flamethrower operated. In describing the drawn illustration of the flamethrower in the book, the Wujing Zongyao states: ...|$|E
500|$|Constructing his designs proved {{far more}} {{difficult}} than Evans initially envisaged—with just six working steam engines in the United States at this time, {{and a handful of}} workshops with any experience making them, it took Evans much of his savings and two years to yield a working example to display to the public in 1803. This first engine was powered by a <b>double-acting</b> cylinder six inches in diameter and with a piston stroke length of eighteen inches. Many components, such as the flywheel and crosshead, were made of wood in order to simplify construction. The boiler, the engineering of which was critical to the safe operation of the engine, consisted of a large copper shell encased in wood and cast iron rings in order to contain the pressure. The output of the machine was approximately five horsepower. This work output was modest by contemporary standards—the low-pressure engine of the nearby waterworks produced about twelve horsepower. But his steam engine was just a fraction of the size of pre-existing machines—the waterworks machine was over twenty-five times larger in volume. Evans unveiled his engine at his store and put it to work crushing plaster of Paris and, more sensationally, sawing slabs of marble. The showmanship paid off, and thousands came to see the machine in operation, while the Philadelphia newspaper Aurora declared [...] "a new era {{in the history of the}} steam engine." ...|$|E
