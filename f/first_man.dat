5|$|About {{twenty years}} before the play begins, the Arctic {{explorer}} Captain John Hatteras became the <b>first</b> <b>man</b> to reach the North Pole, but went mad in the attempt (as described in Verne's novel The Adventures of Captain Hatteras).

5|$|After being rested for the eight-wicket {{win over}} Hampshire, Morris {{rectified}} his technical problem, and success followed against Sussex. After the hosts had been rolled for 86 {{in their first}} innings, Morris dominated an opening partnership of 153 with Brown, who made only 44 before becoming the <b>first</b> <b>man</b> to fall. Morris added a further 189 for the second wicket with Bradman before he fell for 184 at 2/342. He had struck 26 fours, laying the platform for Australia's total of 5/549 declared and eventual innings victory. He was to hit five more first-class centuries {{before the end of}} the season.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with his}} real-life brother Jeff, he gained notoriety in WWF's tag team {{division}} {{due to their}} participation in Tables, Ladders and Chairs matches. As a tag team wrestler, Hardy is a 12-time world tag team champion, having held six WWF/World Tag Team Championships, two WWE/Raw Tag Team Championships, ROH World Tag Team Championship, one WCW Tag Team Championship and two TNA World Tag Team Championships (the <b>first</b> <b>man</b> to have held all said titles, followed by Jeff).|$|E
5|$|As {{an author}} of six books, Blancornelas was {{regarded}} by the press as a leading expert on organized crime and drug trafficking during his time. He was also the <b>first</b> <b>man</b> to publish a photograph of Ramón Arellano Félix, the former drug lord of the Tijuana Cartel. In response to the photo publication, the cartel attempted to kill Blancornelas in 1997, {{but he managed to}} survive the attack and continued to report on the workings of Mexico's criminal underworld.|$|E
5|$|At the NCAA Outdoor Championships that year, he {{won three}} {{separate}} national titles, beating all {{opposition in the}} 100m, 200m, and 4×100 meter relay races. This achievement made him the <b>first</b> <b>man</b> to win the three races at an NCAA Championships since John Carlos did so in 1969. Dix's time of 9.93seconds in the 100m was a world-leader at that point of the season, and was just 0.01 behind Ato Boldon's NCAA record. For these accomplishments, he was again named USATF's Athlete of the Week.|$|E

5|$|Bolt {{followed}} this {{up with a}} successful defence of his Olympic 200 metres title {{with a time of}} 19.32 seconds, followed by Blake at 19.44 and Warren Weir at 19.84 to complete a Jamaican podium sweep. With this, Bolt became the <b>first</b> <b>man</b> in history to defend both the 100 m and 200 m Olympic sprint titles. He was dramatic in victory: in the final metres of the 200 m race, Bolt placed his fingers on his lips, gesturing to silence his critics, and after crossing the line he completed five push-ups – one for each of his Olympic gold medals.|$|E
5|$|Bolt {{was less}} {{challenged}} in the 200m final. His closest rival was Jamaican champion Warren Weir but Bolt ran {{a time of}} 19.66 to finish over {{a tenth of a}} second clear. This performance made Bolt the <b>first</b> <b>man</b> {{in the history of the}} 200 metres at the World Championships in Athletics to win three gold medals over the distance.|$|E
5|$|British colonial {{administration}} was dominated in the 1760s and 1770s by Warren Hastings, the <b>first</b> <b>man</b> {{to hold the}} title of Governor-General. The military arm of the East India Company was directed during the Seven Years' War and the Second Anglo-Mysore War by General Eyre Coote, who died in 1783 during the later stages of the war with Mysore. Company policy, as implemented by Hastings, had involved the company in intrigues and shifting alliances involving France, Mysore, the Marathas, and factions within those and other local territories.|$|E

5|$|Captain Robert L. Cardenas, USAAF, {{served as}} a B-24 {{aircraft}} pilot in the European Theater of Operations with the 506th Bombardment Squadron. He was awarded the Air Medal and two oak leaf clusters for bombing missions before being shot down over Germany in March 1944. Despite head wounds from flak, {{he made his way}} back to Allied control. On October 14, 1947, Cardenas flew the B-29 launch aircraft that released the X-1 experimental rocket plane in which Charles E. Yeager became the <b>first</b> <b>man</b> to fly faster than the speed of sound. Cardenas retired as brigadier general.|$|E
5|$|In Dorset, Druitt {{played for}} the Kingston Park Cricket Club, and the Dorset County Cricket Club. He was {{particularly}} noted for his skill as a bowler. In 1882 and 1883, he toured the West Country with a gentleman's touring team called the Incogniti. One of Druitt's fellow local players was Francis Lacey, the <b>first</b> <b>man</b> knighted for services to cricket. Druitt played for another wandering team, the Butterflies, on 14 June 1883, when they drew against his alma mater Winchester College. The team included first-class cricketers A. J. Webbe, J. G. Crowdy, John Frederick and Charles Seymour.|$|E

In April, he was defeated by South Korean Shon Wan-ho in the final of the India Open, but retained his Malaysia Open Grand Prix Gold title for the fourth time in a row in May. Lee was out for three to four weeks after suffering an ankle injury during the Thomas Cup Group C tie against Denmark.|$|E
