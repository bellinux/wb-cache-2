50|$|The Hot and Hot <b>Fish</b> <b>Club,</b> {{also known}} as Hot and Hot <b>Fish</b> <b>Club</b> of All Saints Parish, was a gentlemen's club in the 19th century in South Carolina {{dedicated}} to epicurean pursuits: gourmet foods, strong drinks and festive times. It started after the American Revolutionary War (early 19th century) and ended during the American Civil War (1864-65).|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2012 Aberdeenshire Council {{gave the}} go-ahead for the present owner's planned {{restoration}} work on the temple and bridges, which he hoped would enhance existing facilities at nearby Drinnies Wood surrounding the Observatory, White Cow Woods and Aden Country Park. The lake is used regularly by local fishermen, and a <b>fishing</b> <b>club</b> with about 120 members was established in 2011. The rest of the estate is seldom used by local residents, {{many of whom are}} completely unaware of it.|$|E
5|$|Ricketts' {{stone house}} {{served as the}} base for the Ozone hiking club of Wilkes-Barre's {{excursions}} on the mountain; the club gave its name to Ozone waterfall in the park. In 1879 Ricketts started the North Mountain <b>Fishing</b> <b>Club,</b> for anglers on the lake and creek. Guests of the hotel paid one dollar to fish as a club member. In 1889 Ricketts hired Matt Hirlinger and five other men to build the trails along the branches of Kitchen Creek and its waterfalls. It took them four years to complete the trails and stone steps through the glens.|$|E
5|$|The First Fork is {{the second}} largest {{tributary}} and has its source in Cummings Township. It flows south-southeast passing to the southwest of Little Round Top and Puterbaugh Mountain, then leaves the dissected Allegheny Plateau at Fishery Point. It then enters Mifflin Township, where it joins Larrys Creek just south of Salladasburg, 4.2 miles (6.8km) from the mouth. Historically, much of the First Fork was protected {{as part of the}} Ogontz Lodge, a private hunting and <b>fishing</b> <b>club.</b>|$|E

5|$|The North Mountain House was {{threatened}} by a forest fire in 1900; the subsequent loss {{of much of the}} surrounding old-growth forest led to decreased numbers of hotel guests. In 1903 another large fire on North Mountain threatened the sawmill in the village of Ricketts. The wooden addition to the stone house was torn down in either 1897 or 1903, and the land became a garden. The hotel closed in November 1903, and the <b>fishing</b> <b>club</b> and passenger train service ended with the closure.|$|E
5|$|What {{remained}} of the estate was sold after the First World War. The mansion house was demolished in about 1926, and its stone used to build council houses in Aberdeen. In more recent times some of the remaining buildings, including the temple, the bridges and the stables, have been classified as at high risk by Historic Scotland because their condition has become poor. The chapel was fully renovated and converted to a private residence in 2003; the observatory was purchased and restored by Banff & Buchan District Council (now Aberdeenshire Council) and can be accessed by the public. The racecourse has been forested since 1926, and the lake is used by members of a private <b>fishing</b> <b>club.</b>|$|E
5|$|Carl G. Fisher, who was {{responsible}} for much of the development of Miami Beach, bought Adams Key, once known as Cocolobo Key, in 1916 and built the Cocolobo Cay Club in 1922. The two-story club building had ten guest rooms, a dining room, and a separate recreation lodge. Patrons included Warren G. Harding, Albert Fall, T. Coleman du Pont, Harvey Firestone, Jack Dempsey, Charles F. Kettering, Will Rogers and Frank Seiberling. Israel Jones' sons Lancelot and Arthur dropped out of the lime-growing business after competition from Mexican limes made their business less profitable, and after a series of devastating hurricanes in 1938 they became full-time fishing guides at the Cocolobo Club. The club had declined with the crash of 1929 which cost Fisher his fortune, but was revived by Garfield Wood in 1934. Among the Joneses' clients was avid fisherman Herbert Hoover and his family. The Joneses also provided the club with fish, lobster and crabs. Arthur and Lancelot Jones were the second largest landowners and the only permanent residents of the lower Biscayne Bay keys during the 1960s. Wood sold the Cocolobo Cay Club to a group of investors led by Miami banker Bebe Rebozo in 1954, who renamed it the Coco Lobo <b>Fishing</b> <b>Club.</b> Clients guided by the Joneses included then-senators John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Herman Talmadge and George Smathers through the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E
