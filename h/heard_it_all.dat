500|$|According to Beyoncé's {{publicity}} material, {{she grew}} up in a Texas area where Spanish was a popular language and <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> the time. She studied the language as a child but forgot it as {{she grew up}} and rose to fame. Beyoncé was planning to take Spanish lessons because she had learn the language again and then the song by imitating the sounds. She stated: [...] "I had the best coach; I did it phonetically, every sentence I recorded maybe four times." [...] A [...] "Making of ..." [...] video was created while Beyoncé was recording the song with Fernández. While creating the song, Beyoncé had producer Rudy Perez coach her in her Spanish, as {{she did not want to}} misrepresent the language.|$|E
500|$|Alexis Petridis of The Guardian {{admitted}} that the chorus of the song is triumphant. Chris Norris of Blender wrote that the song [...] "evokes both early-'80s dance giants the S.O.S. Band and early-'80s dance giant Madonna." [...] Matt Zabosek of The Chicago Maroon wrote: [...] "...'Get Together' is probably the best, but it's hard not to feel that Madonna's computerized voice is a cheat (perhaps to cover for the high notes she can no longer reach?)" [...] Diego Costa of The UWM Post in review of the song, wrote: [...] "In this one-step-up-from-lounge-track, Madonna is a teen again, wondering {{if there is such}} a thing as love at first sight. But in the end, as a wise woman, she realizes that whether it exists or not, she doesn't care, since 'all is just an illusion.' Yeah, we <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> before, she will even admit it in the following track, but it doesn't mean we don't want to hear it again." [...] In 2007, the song was nominated in the category of Best Dance Recording at the 49th Grammy Awards but lost to Justin Timberlake's 2006 single [...] "SexyBack".|$|E
500|$|... "Sorry" [...] {{was one of}} {{the first}} tracks {{developed}} for Confessions on a Dance Floor, along with [...] "Hung Up" [...] and [...] "Future Lovers". It was also the one which took the most time to finish because Madonna [...] "thought it was too melodramatic and could never decide when it was right." [...] The songs were developed with a remixed perspective in mind. Madonna commented that, [...] "Whenever I make records, I often like the remixes better than the original ones. [...] So I thought, screw that. I'm going to start from that perspective". She promoted the album at the dance party [...] "Misshapes" [...] held at Luke & Leroy's nightclub in Greenwich Village, invited by Junior Sanchez to take over the DJ booth where she mixed [...] "Hung Up" [...] with [...] "Sorry". Musically, [...] "Sorry" [...] is an uptempo dance song containing layers of beats and strong vocal on the chorus. It is set in common time with a moderately fast dance groove tempo of 132 beats per minute. Composed in the key of C minor, Madonna's vocal range spans from F3 to G4. It follows the chord progression of E–Cm–A–B during the spoken introduction. It then changes to Fm–Gm-Cm in the chorus, while continuing in A–Cm–A–Fm in the intermediate verses, ultimately ending in repeated lines of [...] "I've <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> before".|$|E

2500|$|Subsequent albums, such as 1977's When You Hear Lou, You've <b>Heard</b> <b>It</b> <b>All</b> yielded such hit singles as [...] "Lady Love". Other {{releases}} in the 1970s {{included the}} classic album Sit Down And Talk To Me.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{embarked}} on their 10th anniversary tour in early 1982, with Fenn, Burgess and Tosh joining Stewart and Gouldman, along with new keyboardist Vic Emerson. They released [...] "The Power of Love", co-written with Andrew Gold, as a single, {{which did not}} chart. [...] "Run Away", released as a single in June 1982, reached No.50 in the UK; [...] "We've <b>Heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> Before" [...] (October 1982) did not chart. [...] All three of these singles were tracks from the revised North American version of Ten Out of 10, and had not previously been issued in the UK.|$|E
60|$|This {{announcement}} {{produced a}} varied effect upon those who <b>heard</b> <b>it,</b> although <b>all</b> experienced surprise.

2500|$|Both the cognoscenti and {{the public}} adored him. The {{librettist}} Paolo Rolli, a close friend and supporter of Senesino, commented: [...] "Farinelli has surprised me so much that I feel as though I had hitherto heard {{only a small part}} of the human voice, and now have <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> He has besides, the most amiable and polite manners ...." [...] Some fans were more unrestrained: one titled lady was so carried away that, from a theatre box, she famously exclaimed: [...] "One God, one Farinelli!" [...] and was immortalised in a detail of Plate II of William Hogarth's [...] "A Rake's Progress" [...] (she may also appear in Plate IV of his series [...] "Marriage à la mode" [...] of 1745).|$|E
2500|$|For many years, {{he was a}} {{spokesperson}} for the Colonial Penn Life Insurance Company, helping promote the brand on radio and TV to African-American markets much as Ed McMahon did for the white audience (and Alex Trebek continues to do to this day). He was also a spokesman for brewing companies. First appearing in television and radio commercials in the mid-to-late 1960s for Spur Malt Liquor, a Rainier Brewing Company product out of Seattle, he later appeared in a number of Budweiser advertisements. Budweiser was a key sponsor for the Rawls telethon and UNCF. There was no attempt to avoid the similarity between the title of the 1977 album When You've Heard Lou, You've <b>Heard</b> <b>It</b> <b>All</b> and his corporate sponsor's slogan [...] "When You Say Budweiser, You've Said It All". [...] A track on the 1978 album Lou Rawls Live, features Rawls singing the commercial slogan. Anheuser-Busch, the brewers of Budweiser, also suggested his telethon work to him.|$|E
2500|$|However, Andy Gill from The Independent {{awarded the}} album two stars. He criticised Minogue's lack of {{creative}} delivery, by stating [...] "But they’re let {{down by the}} lack of character in Kylie’s delivery, most notably on “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town”, a posthumous duet with Frank Sinatra, where his easy, relaxed manner is in sharp contrast to her discomfort." [...] He commended the musical diversity of the tracks, highlighting [...] "Let It Snow", [...] "Winter Wonderland", and [...] "Every Day's Like Christmas", and highlighted [...] "White December", [...] "Cried Out Christmas", and [...] "Christmas Wrapping" [...] as the best tracks. Lauren Murphy from The Irish Times argued the relevance of the album, by stating [...] "We’ve <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> before, so do we really need another pop star doing another bog-standard Christmas album with a sprinkling of festive cheese? To be fair, Kylie Minogue is better placed than most to do such an album, given her longevity in the business." [...] Murphy concluded [...] "2,000 Miles {{is one of the few}} saving graces on yet another inessential album that will have no bearing on your enjoyment of the festive season whatsoever." [...] Several publications mentioned the album on their anticipated releases of 2015, including the Daily Mail, and Unrealitytv.co.uk.|$|E

50|$|The core {{of mission}} remains constant—the {{proclamation}} of the Good News of Jesus {{to those who}} have never <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> at <b>all</b> and {{to those who have}} <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> inadequately.

The goal is always to establish a viable local faith community with its own leadership, incorporating the language and customs of the people.|$|R
60|$|His {{eyes were}} {{kindling}} into mine. He held {{my hands in}} a close, impetuous clasp. His voice was infinitely caressing as he pronounced my name.

My ancestors might have turned in their graves just then--but it mattered not. Living love had driven out dead hatred.|$|R
