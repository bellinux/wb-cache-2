For {{most of the}} adult roles, Haneke selected actors {{with whom he had}} worked before and therefore knew they were suitable for the roles. The role of the pastor was originally written for Ulrich Mühe, an actor who had starred in several of Haneke's past productions, but who died in 2007. Various actors were considered for replacement and eventually the part went to Burghart Klaußner, whom the director did not personally <b>know</b> <b>before.</b> Actors with significant stage experience were preferred because of the measured language of the screenplay.|$|E
25|$|The {{first five}} series were {{presented}} by Angela Groothuizen, {{the sixth and}} the seventh by Karel van de Graaf, the eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh by Pieter Jan Hagens and the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth series are presented by the winner of 2011: Art Rooijakkers. In the first four seasons, Groothuizen was informed from the beginning who the Mole was, but in her last series (the first celebrity edition), she was not told. Van de Graaf and Bousema (Junior series) chose not to <b>know.</b> <b>Before</b> the final episode of the 2006 version aired, in which Frédérique Huydts was revealed as the winner, she died of cancer. Huydts chose to donate her money to the WWF and KiKa, a fund for children with cancer. She also expressed her wish for the show to be aired normally. When Hagens hosted the eighth season, he didn't know the Mole starting out, but was informed for the fifth episode. In the ninth series he didn't know the Mole at all, but in the tenth and eleventh series he knew from the start. When Rooijakkers took over the hosting, he too was informed of {{the identity of the}} Mole from the start onwards.|$|E
25|$|But {{there is}} a {{peculiarity}} in Cousin's doctrine of activity or freedom, and in his doctrine of reason, which enters deeply into his system. This is the element of spontaneity in volition and in reason. This {{is the heart of}} what is new alike in his doctrine of knowledge and being. Liberty or freedom is a generic term which means a cause or being endowed with self-activity. This is to itself and its own development its own ultimate cause. Free-will is so, although it is preceded by deliberation and determination, i.e. reflection, for we are always conscious that even after determination we are free to will or not to will. But {{there is a}} primary kind of volition which has not reflection for its condition, which is yet free and spontaneous. We must have willed thus spontaneously first, otherwise we could not <b>know,</b> <b>before</b> our reflective volition, that we could will and act. Spontaneous volition is free as reflective, but it is the prior act of the two. This view of liberty of will is the only one in accordance with the facts of humanity; it excludes reflective volition, and explains the enthusiasm of the poet and the artist in the act of creation; it explains also the ordinary actions of mankind, which are done as a rule spontaneously and not after reflective deliberation.|$|E

[...] The network's executives were receptive to the idea, which would be one of the main reasons Parker and Stone decided to sign on with the channel.

500|$|In a pre-release comment, {{popular culture}} expert Robert Thompson said: [...] "The fact is, {{the story has}} {{developed}} in so many odd ways with all the controversy, and the sequel can't really promise the bang of that first video—which is informing people of something they did not <b>know</b> <b>before.</b> Now we're getting into the details, which is never that thrilling." [...] The LRA researcher Craig Valters of the LSE's department of International Development said that the second video [...] "overwhelmingly" [...] failed to answer criticisms raised by the first film. On the other hand, Mike Pflanz, East Africa correspondent for The Daily Telegraph, said that the sequel was [...] "a more solid, moving and, finally, accurate presentation of the ongoing battle to capture Joseph Kony" [...] and that, {{in comparison to the}} original video, the [...] "new video is couched in nuance and deploys dialogue more commonly heard in a United Nations workshop – displacement, rehabilitation, post-conflict—than in a YouTube smash." ...|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall of HitFix {{praised the}} episode structure, writing [...] "The quick {{transitions}} and constant back-and-forth movement among subplots generated more energy that, {{when combined with}} several characters we either didn't <b>know</b> <b>before</b> or hadn't {{seen in a long}} time, made [...] "The Broken Man" [...] feel livelier." [...] Similarly, Ed Power of The Daily Telegraph also praised the episode, noting, [...] "Once again there was a sense Game of Thrones was steeling itself for battles - and expensive set-pieces - chugging down the track. A storm is brewing - for now, we were invited to enjoy what remains of the calm." [...] Jen Chaney of Vulture also felt the episode was more of a set up episode for storylines to be resolved in the close of the season, writing [...] "Although two bombs get dropped in this week's episode of Game of Thrones, it's an hour focused on putting the narrative chess pieces into place. [...] "The Broken Man" [...] doesn't finish off any of its major moves. Those bold turns are yet to come." ...|$|E

500|$|Between 1941 and 1983, Coggins wrote or {{illustrated}} 44 {{books on}} a wide range of marine, military, historical and educational themes. Among his more famous works is the 1962 authoring and illustration of Arms and Equipment of the Civil War. Dale E. Biever, registrar at the Civil War Library and Museum in Philadelphia, described the work as [...] "not about generals or battles but about the things one should <b>know</b> <b>before</b> delving into those areas...a welcome addition to any Civil War library." [...] It was republished several times, most recently in 2004. In 1966, Coggins wrote and illustrated The Horseman's Bible, which sold over 500,000copies with a revised edition published in 1984. In this book Coggins acknowledges his father [...] "whose twenty five years in the cavalry and lifetime interest in horses made his advice invaluable." [...] Coggins's last book was Marine Painter's Guide, which was first published in 1983. After the book was published, he decided to stop writing to concentrate more on painting. A new edition of Marine Painter's Guide was published in 2005 by Dover Publications, the publisher of new editions for several of his books.|$|E
500|$|Although the Mr. Hankey {{short film}} was never made, Parker and Stone made two Christmas-related {{animated}} short films called The Spirit of Christmas, {{which served as}} precursors to the South Park series. When the shorts began to generate interest for a possible television series, Parker and Stone originally conceived {{the idea of a}} South Park-like show with four children characters, but with a talking stool named Mr. Hankey as the show's main protagonist; they planned to call it [...] "The Mr. Hankey Show". They pitched the idea to friend Brian Graden, then a television executive with the Fox Broadcasting Company, but he rejected it and said, according to Matt Stone, [...] "I'm not putting poo on my network". Parker and Stone adapted their original idea into a show revolving around the South Park town and four children without Mr. Hankey as a protagonist, but they planned to revive the character as a minor supporting role in a future episode. Later, when Comedy Central expressed interest in the series, Parker and Stone brought up the idea of a Mr. Hankey episode during negotiations with the network executives. Parker claimed during a meeting, he said, [...] "One thing we have to <b>know</b> <b>before</b> we really go any further: {{how do you feel about}} talking poo?" [...] The executives were receptive to the idea, which Parker said was one of the main reasons he and Stone decided to sign on with the channel.|$|E
500|$|Schaffner {{likens the}} Beatles' 1966 {{recordings}} {{to the moment}} of transformation in the film Wizard of Oz, [...] "where, when Dorothy discovers herself transported from Kansas to Oz, the film dramatically changes from black-and-white to glorious technicolor". The album was also the source of confusion for the group's more conservative fans. A female fan later complained in Beatles Monthly that 1966 represented the end of [...] "The Beatles we used to <b>know</b> <b>before</b> they went stark, raving mad." [...] The release coincided with a period of public relations challenges for the band, the combination of which led to their decision to retire from touring that year. In the United States, the album's release was a secondary event to the controversy surrounding the recent publication there of Cleave's interview with Lennon, {{in which he had}} remarked that the Beatles had become [...] "more popular than Jesus". This episode followed the unfavourable reaction to the Yesterday and Today butcher sleeve, from the press, radio stations and retail outlets in the US. As a result, at press conferences during the North American tour, questions were typically focused on religious matters rather than the band's new music. In Britain, however, EMI had gradually distributed songs from the album to radio stations throughout July 1966 – a strategy that MacDonald describes as [...] "building anticipation for what would clearly be a radical new phase in the group's recording career".|$|E
