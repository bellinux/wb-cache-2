25|$|Soft-paste porcelains {{date back}} from the early {{attempts}} by European potters to replicate Chinese porcelain by using mixtures of clay and frit. Soapstone and lime were {{known to have been}} included in these compositions. These wares were not yet actual porcelain wares as they were not hard nor vitrified by firing <b>kaolin</b> <b>clay</b> at high temperatures. As these early formulations suffered from high pyroplastic deformation, or slumping in the kiln at high temperatures, they were uneconomic to produce and of low quality. Formulations were later developed based on kaolin with quartz, feldspars, nepheline syenite or other feldspathic rocks. These were technically superior, and continue to be produced. Soft-paste porcelains are fired at lower temperatures than hard-paste porcelain, therefore these wares are generally less hard than hard-paste porcelains.|$|E

25|$|Ballarat rose to {{prominence}} as a goldrush boomtown, though gold no longer plays {{a pivotal role}} in the economy of the city. Nevertheless, deep underground mining continues to the present date with a single main mine operating. There are still thought to be large, undiscovered gold reserves in the Ballarat region, with investigations being made by local and national companies. Lihir Gold invested in Ballarat Goldfields in 2006, however it downscaled its operations in 2009 due to the expense of extraction before selling its stake in 2010 to Castlemaine Goldfields. Along with gold, lignite (coal), <b>kaolin</b> (<b>clay)</b> and iron ore have also been mined in the Ballarat region and nearby Lal Lal however many of the resource deposits have since been exhausted. An active quarrying industry with large enterprises including Boral Limited extracts and manufactures building materials from the Ballarat region, including clays, aggregates, cements, asphalts.|$|E

50|$|Recent {{trials of}} {{nontoxic}} kaolin clay-based sprays indicate an effective alternative means of codling moth suppression {{may be on}} the horizon. Codling moths and other pests find leaves and fruit covered in <b>kaolin</b> <b>clay</b> unfit for laying eggs. Tiny particles of the clay tend to attach to their bodies, disturbing and repelling them. In addition, trees covered in <b>kaolin</b> <b>clay</b> can make them less recognizable as habitat to codling moths. Full coverage of trees is necessary to achieve effective suppression. If used only {{at the beginning of the}} fruit growing season, <b>kaolin</b> <b>clay</b> often comes off by itself due to wind and rain attrition, leaving fruit clean at harvest time.|$|E
