Most illnesses associated with molluscan shellfish can be traced to problems associated with growing area classification.

50|$|Tandem {{signaling}} is the two-step {{conversion of}} a digital signal into an analog signal, {{followed by the}} reverse conversion. While there is a universal standard for analog signal transmission, digital signals may employ a variety of sampling rates and encoding methods (codecs). Any differences in sampling rate or encoding between transmitter and receiver introduces errors or artifacts in the resulting signal. When speech is being transmitted, as in audio telephone calls, tandem signaling may produce unintelligible results. Tandem signaling is an important <b>evaluation</b> <b>criterion</b> {{in the evaluation of}} speech coders.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, the {{internal}} evaluation measures are {{best suited to}} get some insight into situations where one algorithm performs better than another, but this shall not imply that one algorithm produces more valid results than another. Validity as measured by such an index depends on the claim {{that this kind of}} structure exists in the data set. An algorithm designed for some kind of models has no chance if the data set contains a radically different set of models, or if the evaluation measures a radically different criterion. For example, k-means clustering can only find convex clusters, and many evaluation indexes assume convex clusters. On a data set with non-convex clusters neither the use of k-means, nor of an <b>evaluation</b> <b>criterion</b> that assumes convexity, is sound.|$|E

50|$|Most bid {{processes}} are multi-tiered. Acquisitions under a specified dollar amount can be “user discretion” permitting the request or to choose who ever they want. This level {{can be as}} low as $100 or as high as $10,000 depending on the organization. The rationale is the savings realized by processing these request the same as expensive items is minimal and does not justify the time and expense. Purchasing departments watch for abuses of the user discretion privilege. Acquisitions in a mid range can be processed with a slightly more formal process. This process may involve the user providing quotes from three separate suppliers. Purchasing may be asked or required to obtain the quotes. The formal bid process starts as low as $10,000 or as high as $100,000 depending on the organization. The bid usually involves a specific form the bidder fills out and must be returned by a specified deadline. Depending of the commodity being purchased and the organization the bid may specify a weighted <b>evaluation</b> <b>criterion.</b> Other bids would be evaluated {{at the discretion of}} purchasing or the end users. Some bids could be evaluated by a cross-functional committee. Other bids may be evaluated by the end user or the buyer in Purchasing. Especially in small, private firms the bidders could be evaluated on criteria or factors that have little if {{anything to do with the}} actual bid. Examples of these factors are history of the bidder with the company, history of the bidder with the company’s senior management at other firms, and bidder’s breadth of products.|$|E
