50|$|Arthritis is a <b>disorder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints.</b> It {{involves}} {{inflammation of}} one or more joints. When affected by arthritis, the joint or joints affected may be painful to move, may move in unusual directions or may be immobile completely. The symptoms of arthritis will vary differently between types of arthritis. The most common form of arthritis: Osteoarthritis can affect both the larger and smaller joints of the human skeleton. The cartilage in the affected joints will degrade, soften and wear away. This decreases the mobility of the joints and decreases the space between bones where cartilage should be.|$|E
40|$|Generalised {{osteoarthritis}} (OA) is {{a common}} <b>disorder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> {{which can lead to}} pain and disability. Identification of the determinant gene(s) is limited in part by the lack of Mendelian inheritance in most forms of the disorder, the combination of genetic and environmental influences and the late development of the condition. An approach to the investigation of the aetiology of OA would be {{to take advantage of the}} monogenic basis of inherited skeletal dysplasias in which OA is a major component. For this reason, the molecular genetic basis of the epiphyseal dysplasias, which encompass a spectrum of phenotypes ranging from mild to severe skeletal involvement, is addressed in this thesis. Familial skeletal disorders in South Africa in which OA is a major feature were identified and investigated using intragenic and closely linked microsatellite markers in order to determine linkage to candidate genes.

30|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent, {{disabling}} <b>disorder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> {{that affects}} {{a large population}} worldwide and {{for which there is}} no definitive cure. This review provides critical insights into the basic knowledge on OA that may lead to innovative end efficient new therapeutic regimens. While degradation of the articular cartilage is the hallmark of OA, with altered interactions between chondrocytes and compounds of the extracellular matrix, the subchondral bone has been also described as a key component of the disease, involving specific pathomechanisms controlling its initiation and progression. The identification of such events (and thus of possible targets for therapy) has been made possible by the availability of a number of animal models that aim at reproducing the human pathology, in particular large models of high tibial osteotomy (HTO). From a therapeutic point of view, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represent a promising option for the treatment of OA and may be used concomitantly with functional substitutes integrating scaffolds and drugs/growth factors in tissue engineering setups. Altogether, these advances in the fundamental and experimental knowledge on OA may allow for the generation of improved, adapted therapeutic regimens to treat human OA.|$|E

40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is an age related <b>disorder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> {{characterized}} by pain, crepitus, and stiffness resulting in decreased mobility. Pathophysiology consists of cartilage degeneration and bone remodeling, however, knowledge of OA etiology is still limited. Due {{to the growing}} population of elderly, OA prevalence rapidly increases. The fact that no reliable clinical markers are available for diagnosis, monitoring and progression is a major impediment in OA disease management and incurs high costs in drug development and clinical trials. Molecular markers were studied in OA affected cartilage compared to unaffected cartilage of the same joint (chapter 2) and in blood of OA patients (chapter 3). Perturbation of the application of traditional biochemical markers sCOMP and uCTX 2 in the clinic due to genetic factors that, independent of OA, affect innate levels was investigated (chapter 4). Furthermore, {{we have tried to}} go beyond the results of molecular epidemiological studies to increase insights into underlying mechanisms (chapter 6 & 7). This shows how functional genomics can be achieved by combining genetic and functional data and will facilitate translation of knowledge of genetic variants to the needs of OA patients and thus to application in the clinic.

The causes of RA are poorly understood although it is generally accepted that it is an autoimmune disorder triggered by microbial infection (particularly by Proteus spp.). Whilst there is currently no known cure for RA, a wide variety of bushfoods and herbal remedies may be used in traditional medicine to treat (RA) and inflammation. Ninety five extracts from 38 Australian bushfood plant species with a history of ethnobotanical usage were investigated for their ability to control the microbial trigger for RA (P. mirabilis). Fifty six of the extracts (58. 9 %) inhibited the growth of P. mirabilis. Extracts of candlenut, camphorwood, quinine tree leaf, gumbi gumbi, Brush cherry and riberry fruit and Tasmanian pepper peppercorn and leaf were particularly effective Proteus inhibitors. All extracts with Proteus inhibitory activity were also either non-toxic, or of low toxicity in the Artemia nauplii bioassay.

40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is a {{degenerative}} <b>disorder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> and is {{the most}} common cause of arthritis in adults. Osteoarthritis, also known as degenerative joint disease (DJD), occurs because of “wear and tear” of the joints that is often related to increased stress on the joint or injury to the joint. However, in many cases, OA occurs simply in relation to aging. In osteoarthritis, the cartilage that protects the edges of our bones wears away and causes irritation of the underlying bone. As a result, moving the joint becomes more painful. Risk factors for OA include obesity, heredity, joint injury, and increased stress on the joint. Symptoms of OA include joint stiffness that improves with exercise, pain that worsens with use of the joint, and possibly joint enlargement. The knee {{is the most common}}ly affected joint in OA, but joints of the hands, feet, hips, and spine may also be involved. Treatment is largely aimed at relieving pain associated with OA. Initial treatments include weight loss, physical therapy and exercises, and joint braces. Therapeutic medications include acetaminophen, NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, and topical medicines. Patients may receive steroid or viscous injections in a single joint for temporary relief. If these interventions are not helpful, a patient may be referred to an orthopaedic surgeon for further management and possible surgery...|$|E

40|$|CLASSICAL arthrogryposis {{multiplex}} congenita is {{a striking}} clinical condition that has been recognized for over one hundred years. Otto in 1841 originally described an infant born with rigidity of the limbs which were fixed in certain bizarre positions. Since then several hundred cases have been described in numerous articles and the clinical features have been clearly outlined (Brandt, 1947; Banker, Victor and Adams, 1957; Mead et ah, 1958). Many authors have reviewed the historical aspects of this disorder {{and most of these}} will not be referred to again. Various concepts as to the fundamental nature of the disease have been entertained and until recently only limited pathological verification for one or another theory was available. Originally the popular notion prevailed that there was a primary <b>disorder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> or periarticular tissues. This prompted Rosenkranz in 1905 to report on congenital contractures of the extremities and to first use the term arthrogryposis, meaning curved joints. Rocher in 1913 suggested the title of "multiple congenital articular rigidities " and Stern in 1923 consolidated this into the clumsy but most lasting term "{{arthrogryposis multiplex congenita}}. " Because of {{the very nature of the}} disease the great majority of cases have been reported in the orthopaedic literature, the largest of which is a description of the features of 40 cases by Mead, Lithgow and Sweeney in 1958. It has been shown that fusion of the joints in an ankylosing process does not occur in arthrogryposis, for at autopsy when the periarticular tissues and tendons are sectioned the joints swing free.

40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is {{a chronic}} autoimmune <b>disorder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints.</b> In K/BxN arthritis, disease is mediated by autoantibodies directed toward glucose 6 -phosphate isomerase (G 6 PI). It is currently believed that G 6 PI is deposited on the joint cartilage where it facilitates autoantibody-mediated attack. This model is {{heavily dependent on}} the recruitment of neutrophils in order {{to contribute to the}} inflammatory phenotype. We investigated the role of I kappa B kinase epsilon, a non-canonical activator of NF-[kappa]B, {{in the absence of an}} interferon response in the pathogenesis of RA. Arthritis in Ikbke-/- mice is attenuated and is characterized by reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil-recruiting chemokines in the joints. Interestingly, these mice are sensitized to therapeutic doses of interferon therapy, which to date has not shown efficacy at reasonable doses in human RA. Accordingly, Ifnar 1 -/- mice experience increased joint swelling in the K/BxN serum transfer model of arthritis as compared to wild-type mice. Unexpectedly, targeting of Ikbke-/- enhances the level of arthritis in the Ifnar 1 -/- mice. Ifnar 1 -/- mice are neutrophilic and have expanded neutrophil-recruiting capacities. We propose that the mechanism by which IKK[Epsilon] enhances arthritis in the absence of interferon signaling is through the desensitization of neutrophils to apoptosis. IKK[Epsilon] deficiency prevents proper neutrophil clearance by prolonging neutrophil lifespan and delaying apoptosis. Therefore, arthritis in doubly deficient mice is enhanced by both the increased neutrophil recruiting capacities displayed by loss of interferon signaling and extended lifespans of these recruited neutrophils via loss of IKK[Epsilon...|$|E

It is currently believed that G 6 PI is deposited on the joint cartilage where it facilitates autoantibody-mediated attack. Here, {{we show that}} intracellular G 6 PI is expunged by neutrophils undergoing 'ETosis' in an area encompassed by DNA-based extracellular traps (ETs). K/BxN arthritic synovial tissue staining revealed the presence of ETs. We investigated the capacity of K/BxN serum to stimulate the release of ETs by neutrophils (NETs) and observed the formation of NETs. Co- staining for G 6 PI showed that the autoantigen is externalized during NET release {{and that it is}} colocalized in NETs. We also found a novel role for cathelin-related antimicrobial peptides (CRAMP) in the pathogenesis of K/ BxN arthritis, as cathelicidin-deficient (Cnlp-/-) mice have an attenuated course of K/BxN arthritis. Two key mediators of K/BxN arthritis are mast cells and neutrophils, both of which are capable of releasing ETs. Mast cells from Cnlp-/- mice are capable of releasing extracellular traps (MCETs), and reconstitution of mast- cell deficient (Pretty 2) mice with Cnlp-/- mast cells recapitulates arthritis. Furthermore, reconstitution of Cnlp-/- mice with wild-type neutrophils recapitulated arthritis to levels comparable to that of a wild-type arthritic mouse. We hypothesize that activated mast cells release MCETs, externalizing G 6 PI in the process. This is further exacerbated by the recruitment of neutrophils and their subsequent production of NETs. This causes more release of cognate antigen into the joint, perpetuating inflammatio...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} <b>disorder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> which afflicts 0. 5 - 1 % of the world’s population, with approximately {{three times as}} many women affected as men. The causes of RA are poorly understood although it is generally accepted that it is an autoimmune disorder triggered by microbial infection (particularly by Proteus spp.). Whilst there is currently no known cure for RA, a wide variety of herbal remedies are used in traditional African medicine to treat (RA) and inflammation. Methods: Thirty four extracts from 13 South African plant species with a history of ethnobotanical usage in the treatment of inflammation were investigated for their ability to control two microbial triggers for RA (P. mirabilis and P. vulgaris). The Artemia nauplii bioassay was used to screen the extracts for toxicity. Results: Twenty nine of the extracts (85. 3 %) inhibited the growth of P. mirabilis and 23 of them tested (67. 7 %) inhibited the growth of P. vulgaris. Methanol and water extracts of Carpobrotus edulis, Lippia javanica, Pelargonium viridflorum, Ptaeroxylon obliquum, Syzygium cordatum leaf and bark, Terminalia pruinoides, Terminalia sericea, Warburgia salutaris bark and an aqueous extract of W. salutaris leaf were effective Proteus inhibitors, with MIC values < 2000 µg/ml. The most potent extracts were examined by RP-HPLC and UV-Vis spectroscopy for the presence of resveratrol. Only extracts from T. pruinoides and T. sericea contained resveratrol, indicating it was not responsible for the anti-Proteus properties reported here. All extracts with Proteus inhibitory activity were also either non-toxic, or of low toxicity in the Artemia nauplii bioassay. Conclusions: The low toxicity of these extracts and their inhibitory bioactivity against Proteus spp. indicate their potential for blocking the onset of rheumatoid arthritis.

Secondary effects of photon absorption include increases in ATP, a brief burst of reactive oxygen species, an increase in nitric oxide, and modulation of calcium levels. Tertiary effects include activation {{of a wide range of}} transcription factors leading to improved cell survival, increased proliferation and migration, and new protein synthesis. There is a pronounced biphasic dose response whereby low levels of light have stimulating effects, while high levels of light have inhibitory effects. It has been found that PBM can produce ROS in normal cells, but when used in oxidatively stressed cells or in animal models of disease, ROS levels are lowered.

Seventy six patients had clinical peripheral arthritis; 48 had arthritis contributing to loss of function, and 19 of these did not volunteer evidence <b>of</b> their <b>joint</b> disease. <b>The</b> common occurrence <b>of</b> arthritic conditions in the elderly, with consequential disability and dependency, suggests that increased medical awareness {{may be required to}} prevent unnecessary morbidity. Our findings need confirmation in community based studies...|$|R
50|$|The spa {{specializes in}} {{treatment}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{upper respiratory tract}} disorders, including chronic nose and throat inflammations, diseases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vocal apparatus, allergies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper respiratory tract, bronchial asthma; musculoskeletal disorders, i.e. degenerative <b>disorders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spine and <b>joints</b> as well as rheumatoid disorders and rheumatoid arthritis.

2500|$|Neurologists {{and pain}} specialists {{tend to view}} {{fibromyalgia}} as a pathology due to dysfunction of muscles and connective tissue as well as functional abnormalities in the central nervous system. Rheumatologists define the syndrome in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> [...] "central sensitization" [...] – heightened brain response to normal stimuli in <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> <b>disorders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> muscles, <b>joints,</b> or connective tissues. On the other hand, psychiatrists often view fibromyalgia as a type <b>of</b> affective <b>disorder,</b> whereas specialists in psychosomatic medicine tend to view fibromyalgia as being a somatic symptom disorder. These controversies don't engage healthcare specialists alone; some patients object to fibromyalgia being described in purely somatic terms. There is extensive research {{evidence to support the}} view that <b>the</b> central symptom <b>of</b> fibromyalgia, namely pain, has a neurogenic origin, though this is consistent both views.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} {{relationship}} between mandibular asymmetry and <b>disorders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temporomandibular <b>joint.</b> METHODS: We used advanced imaging <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temporomandibular <b>joint</b> to distinguish different causes of mandibular asymmetry. MR imaging and arthrography were applied to <b>the</b> temporomandibular <b>joints</b> <b>of</b> 11 patients presenting with mandibular asymmetry. RESULTS: Condyle hyperplasia was identified as <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> asymmetry in 5 patients. In the other 6 patients the mandibular condyle was normal on the long side, but <b>the</b> short side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> face demonstrated a small condyle head, short condyle neck associated with disk displacement, internal derangement, and degenerative <b>joint</b> disease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temporomandibular <b>joint.</b> CONCLU-SIONS: These observations suggest that both condyle hyperplasia on <b>the</b> long side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mandible and disk displacement and degenerative <b>joint</b> disease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temporomandibular <b>joint</b> on <b>the</b> short side can cause mandibular asymmetry. It was concluded that MR imaging or arthrography can be valuable for understanding <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> mandibular asymmetry and be effective in treatment planning...|$|R
