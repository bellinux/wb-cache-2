40|$|Proceedings of the 2001 Georgia Water Resources Conference, April 26 and 27, 2001, Athens, Georgia. The {{phosphorus}} cycling {{paradigm in}} lakes {{is based on}} data from systems in northern temperate regions. Anoxic respiration in the hypolimnion of north-temperate lakes creates strongly reducing conditions that liberate dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) from settling particulates. Hypolimnetic DIP steadily increases during summer stratification as phosphorus is liberated, and is mixed throughout the water column at <b>fall</b> <b>overturn.</b> This paradigm fails to explain phosphorus cycling in Southeastern Piedmont lakes. No increase in DIP is found in the anoxic hypolimnion during summer stratification; nor is an increase in DIP observed during <b>fall</b> <b>overturn.</b> We hypothesize that the conventional paradigm is not appropriate in iron-rich Southeastern Piedmont lakes because: a) iron-oxide sorption reduces the bioavailability of DIP, and b) the abundance of oxidized iron prevents DIP accumulation in the anoxic hypolimnion. We use iron-oxide chemistry to develop an alternate phosphorus cycling pathway: DIP is released from iron-phosphate particulates when pH increases due to photosynthesis. This mechanism forms a biogeochemical feedback loop that enhances algal blooms. Sponsored and Organized by: U. S.

40|$|Water {{temperatures}} and stratification are important drivers for ecological {{and water quality}} processes within lake systems, and changes in these with increases in air temperature and changes to wind speeds may have significant ecological consequences. To properly manage these systems under changing climate, {{it is important to}} understand the effects of increasing air {{temperatures and}} wind speed changes in lakes of different depths and surface areas. In this study, we simulate three lakes that vary in depth and surface area to elucidate the effects of the observed increasing air temperatures and decreasing wind speeds on lake thermal variables (water temperature, stratification dates, strength of stratification, and surface heat fluxes) over a century (1911 – 2014). For all three lakes, simulations showed that epilimnetic temperatures increased, hypolimnetic temperatures decreased, the length of the stratified season increased due to earlier stratification onset and later <b>fall</b> <b>overturn,</b> stability increased, and longwave and sensible heat fluxes at the surface increased. Overall, lake depth influences the presence of stratification, Schmidt stability, and differences in surface heat flux, while lake surface area influences differences in hypolimnion temperature, hypolimnetic heating, variability of Schmidt stability, and stratification onset and <b>fall</b> <b>overturn</b> dates. Larger surface area lakes have greater wind mixing due to increased surface momentum. Climate perturbations indicate that our larger study lakes have more variability in temperature and stratification variables than the smaller lakes, and this variability increases with larger wind speeds. For all study lakes, Pearson correlations and climate perturbation scenarios indicate that wind speed has a large effect on temperature and stratification variables, sometimes greater than changes in air temperature, and wind can act to either amplify or mitigate the effect of warmer air temperatures on lake thermal structure depending on the direction of local wind speed changes...|$|E

40|$|In {{thermally}} stratified lakes, {{the greatest}} annual methane emissions typically occur during thermal overturn events. In July of 2012, Greenland experienced significant warming {{that resulted in}} substantial melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet and enhanced runoff events. This unusual climate phenomenon provided an opportunity {{to examine the effects}} of short-term natural heating on lake thermal structure and methane dynamics and compare these observations with those from the following year, when temperatures were normal. Here, we focus on methane concentrations within the water column of five adjacent small lakes on the ice-free margin of southwestern Greenland under open-water and ice-covered conditions from 2012 – 2014. Enhanced warming of the epilimnion in the lakes under open-water conditions in 2012 led to strong thermal stability and the development of anoxic hypolimnia in each of the lakes. As a result, during open-water conditions, mean dissolved methane concentrations in the water column were significantly (p  <  0. 0001) greater in 2012 than in 2013. In all of the lakes, mean methane concentrations under ice-covered conditions were significantly (p  <  0. 0001) greater than under open-water conditions, suggesting spring overturn is currently the largest annual methane flux to the atmosphere. As the climate continues to warm, shorter ice cover durations are expected, which may reduce the winter inventory of methane and lead to a decrease in total methane flux during ice melt. Under open-water conditions, greater heat income and warming of lake surface waters will lead to increased thermal stratification and hypolimnetic anoxia, which will consequently result in increased water column inventories of methane. This stored methane will be susceptible to emissions during <b>fall</b> <b>overturn,</b> which may result in a shift in greatest annual efflux of methane from spring melt to <b>fall</b> <b>overturn.</b> The results of this study suggest that interannual variation in ground-level air temperatures may be the primary driver of changes in methane dynamics because it controls both the duration of ice cover and the strength of thermal stratification...|$|E

40|$|Increasing air {{temperatures}} {{may result}} in stronger lake stratification, potentially altering nutrient and biogenic gas cycling. We assessed the impact of climate forcing by comparing the influence of stratification on oxygen, nutrients, and global-warming potential (GWP) of greenhouse gases (the sum of CH 4, CO 2, and N 2 O in CO 2 equivalents) emitted from a shallow productive lake during an average versus a heat-wave year. Strong stratification during the heat wave was accompanied by an algal bloom and chemically enhanced carbon uptake. Solar energy trapped at the surface created a colder, isolated hypolimnion, resulting in lower ebullition and overall lower GWP during the hotter-than-average year. Furthermore, the dominant CH 4 emission pathway shifted from ebullition to diffusion, with CH 4 being produced at surprisingly high rates from sediments (1. 2 – 4. 1 mmol m– 2 d– 1). Accumulated gases trapped in the hypolimnion during the heat wave resulted in a peak efflux to the atmosphere during <b>fall</b> <b>overturn</b> when 70 % of total emissions were released, with littoral zones acting as a hot spot.

The greatest flux of organic matter from the epilimnion occurred during late summer and coincided with whiting events, indicating that calcite precipitation is an effective mechanism for sedimenting organic matter. Carbon isotopes of organic matter were low prior to the onset of stratification, increased to maximum values in late summer, and then decreased following <b>fall</b> <b>overturn.</b> This pattern is controlled mainly by the timing of stratification and primary productivity, which preferentially removes “COZ from the epilimnion.

Ther-modynamic models, idealized reaction stoichiometry, and multivariate regression involving solutes and geographic variables indicate that irreversible weathering can largely account for lake chemistry. By contrast, relatively minor roles are played by reversible ion exchange in soils and sediments, terrestrial bioaccumulation, and transformations in lakes. The regional patterns in lake acidity components (NO,, SO 4, DOC, CO 3, and statistical relationships between acidity and base cations demonstrate that rock weathering is limited by acid inputs in many alpine catchments prior to <b>fall</b> <b>overturn.</b> The empirical success of the Henriksen alkalinity model depends on a high Ca: Na weathering ratio.

To fully respond to those questions, a combination of nutrient loading models and a temperature simulation model were used to project the trophic state, productivity, and duration of stratification of the reservoir. The trophic state index indicates that the reservoir would be eutrophic; the estimated mean annual chlorophyll-a concentration indicated a high likelihood that algal blooms would occur. Dissolved oxygen curves for the reservoir were then developed for the period immediately prior to <b>fall</b> <b>overturn.</b> Curves were developed based on a reservoir with similar nutrient loadings and on theoretical curves from the literature.

40|$|Most of the {{sediment}} components that have accumulated in Elk Lake, Clearwater County, northwestern Minnesota, {{over the past}} 1500 years are authigenic or biogenic (CaCO 3, biogenic SiO 2, organic matter, iron and manganese oxyhydroxides, and iron phosphate) and are delivered to {{the sediment}}–water interface on a seasonal schedule where they are preserved as distinct annual laminae (varves). The annual biogeochemical cycles of these components are causally linked through the ‘carbon pump’, and are recapitulated in longer-term cycles, most prominently with a periodicity of about 400 years. Organic carbon is fixed in the epilimnion by photosynthetic removal of CO 2, which also increases the pH, triggering the precipitation of CaCO 3. The respiration and degradation of fixed organic carbon in the hypolimnion consumes dissolved oxygen, produces CO 2, and lowers the pH so that the hypolimnion becomes anoxic and undersaturated with respect to CaCO 3 during the summer. Some of the CaCO 3 produced in the epilimnion is dissolved in the anoxic, lower pH hypolimnion and sediments. The amount of CaCO 3 that is ultimately incorporated into the sediments {{is a function of}} how much is produced in the epilimnion and how much is consumed in the hypolimnion and the sediments.

Our results show a high degree of seasonal variability in particle dynamics. Total particle fluxes vary from almost zero to more than 600 mg m- 2 d- 1. The highest fluxes occur during short time windows after ice-break-up (minerogenic particles), during spring (planktonic biomass), and during <b>fall</b> <b>overturn</b> (chrysophycean cysts). Particle fluxes also differed markedly from year to year in absolute values (2000 : 644 mg m- 2 d- 1, 2001 : 370 mg m- 2 d- 1) as well as in average values (2000 : 76 mg m- 2 d- 1, 2001 : 44 mg m- 2 d- 1). Annual and seasonal meteorological changes and events have a clear influence on the lake system and on the amount and composition of particles. C/N ratios during April and May increased significantly from 2000 (6 - 14) to 2001 (> 28), reflecting the more intense soil erosion and transport of terrestrial plant remains into the lake caused by heavy precipitation in 2001. Air temperature strongly influences the timing of the occurrence of the main bio-productivity peak. Strong wind events shorten the period of ice cover.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{seasonal}} and spatial distribution of phytoplankters in relation to physio-chemical parameters and discharge regime was conducted in Barren Lake, Kentucky, a flood control reservoir with a dam equipped with a multilevel outlet, from February, 1970, through January, 1971. Paired samples were collected every two weeks from April through October and every three weeks from November through March. Samples were obtained from eight depths in the main pool area of the reservoir and from the tailwater. Reservoir discharge was primarily from the upper 3 m from April through September. At other times, discharge incorporated lower levels to reach and maintain lower winter pool levels. Based upon chemical and biological characteristics, Barren Lake may {{be considered to be}} mesotrophic. The alkalinity levels of the lake (range: 44 - 129 mg/ 1) averaged 91 mg/ 1 over the study period. An anaerobic hypolimnion developed in the late summer, and pH was consistently slightly alkaline. The phytoplankton community was dominated by taxa considered to be characteristic of both eutrophic and oligotrophic waters, but maxima were relatively low (77000 - 155000 cells/ 1). During the study, five major phytoplankton populations were present: March-April, Melosira italica; June, Ceratium hirundinella; July, Asterionella formosa and Dinobryon sertularia; August, Fragilaria crotonensis; and December, Melosira granulata. Two distinct minima occurred in February and May. The main controlling factors for seasonal and spatial succession were concluded to be the physical effects of changing light, temperature, turbidity, turbulence, and discharge. Nutrients, which fluctuated with plankton populations, were always above reported limiting values. Zooplankton, although inversely correlated with phytoplankton populations in the spring, were not felt to affect significantly the phytoplankton populations due to the species composition of the phytoplankton community. The February minimum of 2159 cells/ 1 coincided with high discharge (3600 cfs), high turbidity (123. 8 mg/ 1), and low temperature (3. 3 C). The March-April pulse coincided with the spring increases of light, temperature, and nutrients. The main factors contributing to the pulse was a reduction in discharge (500 cfs), high turbulence, and the improvement in general growing conditions. During May, increasing effects of stratification on turbulence and the rise of discharge rate to 3600 cfs contributed to the spring minimum. In June, Ceratium hirundinella pulsed during high alkalinity (118. 8 mg/ 1) and high temperature (22 - 24 C). It declined as alkalinity decreased to a seasonal low (72. 9 mg/ 1) and disappeared in the fall when temperature dropped below 7. 5 C. Asterionella formosa achieved dominance (2384 cells/ 1) in July below the 6 m level, being restricted there due to its inability to tolerate the high temperature (24 - 29 C) and light intensity (35000 lux @ 0. 5 m) in more shallow waters. Its occurrence so late in the year was attributed to its inability to compete with the Melosira populations of early spring. The decline of A. formosa correlated with increases in temperature and decreases in light at the lower depths. Dinobryon sertularia was associated seasonally and spatially with the populations of A. formosa. Fragilari a crotonens is dominated the phytoplankton maximum of 155754 cells/ 1 in August. It succeeded A_. formosa due to its ability to tolerate higher temperatures (24 - 29 C) and to utilize nutrients, particularly silica, more efficiently. Its subsequent decline corresponded to decreases in temperature, an increase in discharge (1000 cfs), and a decrease in light in late September. Following the decline of F. crotonensis, Melosira granulata produced a maximum of 45062 cells/ 1 in December. Its succession was attributed to the return of homothermy and the resulting increases in turbulence and nutrients at <b>fall</b> <b>overturn.</b> The size of the population may have been influenced by the surge in discharge (3600 cfs) in November. In January, a sharp decline in the population coincided with a surge in discharge (3600 cfs) and decreases of temperature and light to seasonal lows. Tailwater plankton populations generally correlated with main pool populations. Tailwater phytoplankton populations tended to be somewhat lower than those of the main pool. Discrepancies, when they occurred, were attributed to difficulties with sampling equipment, high discharge (3600 cfs), and stratification of plankton populations when discharge occurred from levels not associated with those populations...|$|E

The vision above Brougham's head is of the Regent and McMahon, both ragged, seated facing each other at a plain wooden table on which are a jar of spring water and a lighted candle-end stuck in a bottle. The Regent gnaws a bare bone; McMahon (in miniature) takes up a small fish by the tail. Catalogue of prints and drawings in the British Museum.

40|$|The {{seasonal}} succession {{and productivity}} of the phytoplankton populations in Lake Waubee and Lake of the Woods, Indiana, were investigated from November 1980 to August 1981. Algal community dynamics were related to seasonal variations and interactions of several physical, chemical, and biological factors. Algal bianass maxima coincided with increases in light, nutrients, temperature, and turbulence during <b>fall</b> and spring <b>overturn</b> and in early to mid-summer. Growth characteristics and vertical distribution of bianass varied greatly from season to season with shifts in species composition and were indicative of productive lakes. The periodicity and distribution of in situ rates of primary productivity were also characteristic of fertile lakes. Integral photosynthesis ranged from 200 to 300 mg C m 2 h- 1, indicating mesotrophic to eutrophic conditions. Bioassays for nutrient limitation indicate that algal growth in both lakes is phosphorus-limited during the summer months. Ambient concentrations and loading rates of nitrogen and phosphorus indicate that restoration-management strategies should focus on phosphorus reduction and removal.

Every country {{is entitled to}} her reservations, and pretences, but the more 'democratic' a land is, the more make-believes must the stranger respect. Some of the Tribal Heralds were very good to me in this matter, and, as it were, nudged me {{when it was time}} to duck in the House of Rimmon. During their office hours they professed an unflinching belief in the blessed word 'Democracy,' which means any crowd on the move--that is to say, the helpless thing which breaks through floors and <b>falls</b> into cellars; <b>overturns</b> pleasure-boats by rushing from port to starboard; stamps men into pulp because it thinks it has lost sixpence, and jams and grills in the doorways of blazing theatres. Out of office, like every one else, they relaxed. Many winked, a few were flippant, but they all agreed that the only drawback to Democracy was Demos--a jealous God of primitive tastes and despotic tendencies. I received a faithful portrait of him from a politician who had worshipped him all his life. It was practically the Epistle of Jeremy--the sixth chapter of Baruch--done into unquotable English.|$|R
40|$|Sediments {{from the}} deepest part of Lake of the Clouds (31 m) are rhythmically lami-nated {{throughout}} {{all but the}} basal part of the column. The laminations can be correlated with events in the lake cluring the annual cycle. Ferrous iron (maximum 620 ppm) accumu-lates in a layer of water about 2 m thick in the deepest part of the lake. The laminations form in the sediments only where overlain by this stagnant iron-rich water. The light-colored portion of the couplet presumably forms from iron oxides precipitated from par-tially oxygenated bottom water during <b>fall</b> and spring <b>overturns,</b> the dark layer from organic remains that settle out during summer. Chemical analysis and electron-microprobe studies reveal a much higher concentration of iron and manganese in the light layers than in the dark. Vivianite [Fe:! (POa) z * 8 H,O] and probably limonite (FcaOs * nHzO) occur extensively in nodules throughout the core. Siderite (FeCG) was identified by X-ray diffraction. Numerous orange spherical aggre-gates occur in the light layers. An iron and manganese profile of the sediment column sug-gests that the most distinct laminae are found where the iron content of the sediment is at least 4 %...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Incidental {{falls from}} heights, {{falls on the}} same level caused by {{slipping}} or tripping, and <b>falls</b> from wheelchair <b>overturns</b> are commonplace phenomena, associated with serious injuries from impact with the ground. A wearable airbag device is a countermeasure applicable to all these types of incidents. Three types of wearable airbag systems were developed and evaluated: for protection against falls from heights (Type- 1), against wheelchair overturns (Type- 2), and against falls {{on the same level}} (Type- 3). The systems consist of an airbag, sensor, inflator, and jacket. The sensor detects the fall and the airbag inflates to protect the user. Fall tests using dummies with/without the airbags demonstrated the effectiveness of these devices. In the experiments with system Type- 1, for fall heights of less than 2 m, the airbags reduced the impact acceleration, and the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) values were under 1, 000, the auto-crash test requirement. However, there are limits to the amount of protection afforded: in Type- 1, the airbag can protect only the back of the head.; in Types- 2 and 3, the fall height of the center of gravity is lower than 2 m, and there is some margin of extra protective resource, which can be used to extend the protected area...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The Indian farming employs 225 million {{workforce}} {{to cover}} 140 million hectares of total cultivated land. In spite of rapid farm mechanization (e. g., 149 million farm machinery), the vast resource-poor family farming has primary dependence on traditional methods (e. g., 520 million hand tools and 37 million animal-drawn implements are in operation). The work drudgery, the traumatic accidents and injuries {{are the major}} concerns to examine options for ergonomics intervention and betterment of work in crop production activities. This review summarizes human energy expenditure in crop production activities, to assess the job severity, tools and machinery, and formulate the basis to reorganize work and work methods. While the farm mechanization is more in the northern India, the accidents were more in the villages in southern India. On average of the four regions, the tractor incidents (<b>overturning,</b> <b>falling</b> from the tractor, etc.) were highest (27. 7 %), followed by thresher (14. 6 %), sprayer/duster (12. 2 %), sugarcane crusher (8. 1 %) and chaff cutter (7. 8 %) accidents. Most of the fatal accidents resulted from the powered machinery, with the annual fatality rate estimated as 22 per 100, 000 farmers. The hand tools related injuries (8 % of the total accidents) were non-fatal in nature. In spite of the enactment of legislation, the shortcomings in production and monitoring of the machinery in field use {{may be responsible for}} the high rate o...|$|R
6000|$|While he {{was making}} this uproar, Doña Rita put her fingers in her ears and then {{suddenly}} changed her mind and clapped her hands over my ears. Instinctively I disengaged my head but she persisted. We had a short tussle without moving from the spot, and suddenly I had my head free, and there was complete silence. He had screamed himself out of breath, but Doña Rita muttering: “Too late, too late,” got her hands away from my grip and slipping altogether out of her fur coat seized some garment lying on a chair near by (I think it was her skirt), {{with the intention of}} dressing herself, I imagine, and rushing out of the house. Determined to prevent this, but indeed without thinking very much what I was doing, I got hold of her arm. That struggle was silent, too; but I used the least force possible and she managed to give me an unexpected push. Stepping back to save myself from <b>falling</b> I <b>overturned</b> the little table, bearing the six-branched candlestick. It hit the floor, rebounded with a dull ring on the carpet, and by the time it came to a rest every single candle was out. He {{on the other side of}} the door naturally heard the noise and greeted it with a triumphant screech: “Aha! I’ve managed to wake you up,” the very savagery of which had a laughable effect. I felt the weight of Doña Rita grow on my arm and thought it best to let her sink on the floor, wishing to be free in my movements and really afraid that now he had actually heard a noise he would infallibly burst the door. But he didn’t even thump it. He seemed to have exhausted himself in that scream. There was no other light in the room but the darkened glow of the embers and I could hardly make out amongst the shadows of furniture Doña Rita sunk on her knees in a penitential and despairing attitude. Before this collapse I, who had been wrestling desperately with her a moment before, felt that I dare not touch her. This emotion, too, I could not understand; this abandonment of herself, this conscience-stricken humility. A humbly imploring request to open the door came from the other side. Ortega kept on repeating: “Open the door, open the door,” in such an amazing variety of intonations, imperative, whining, persuasive, insinuating, and even unexpectedly jocose, that I really stood there smiling to myself, yet with a gloomy and uneasy heart. Then he remarked, parenthetically as it were, “Oh, you know how to torment a man, you brown-skinned, lean, grinning, dishevelled imp, you. And mark,” he expounded further, in a curiously doctoral tone—“you are in all your limbs hateful: your eyes are hateful and your mouth is hateful, and your hair is hateful, and your body is cold and vicious like a snake—and altogether you are perdition.” ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAlthough the {{instability}} of the thermohaline circulation has been widely observed in numerical ocean models, theoretical advances have been hindered by the nonlinearity of heat and salt transports, a circulation governed by lateral temperature, and salinity gradients. Because {{the instability}} occurs initially in polar waters through the formation of haloclines and the halt of convection, any explanatory model must {{have at least a}} surface and a deep layer. The model proposed here (two surface boxes above a deep one) reduces to a 2 degrees-of-freedom dynamical system when convection is active and 3 degrees when it is interrupted. The instability that is induced by a negative freshwater perturbation in polar waters has three stages. The first stage is a rapid 5 -yr adjustment to a transient thermal attractor that results from an approximate balance between heat advection and air–sea heat fluxes. The second stage is a slow evolution that self-organizes near this attractor, which preconditions the instability, as it can be shown that the circulation becomes more sensitive to changes in salinity gradients than in temperature gradients. The slow O(100 yr) growth of salinity in the subtropics is the critical precursor of the instability {{while at the same time}} the subpolar salinity rises against the initial perturbation to stabilize the system by increasing the overturning and restoring convection. When the overturning becomes smaller than the value at the unstable fixed point, the third stage occurs, which is when the subpolar salinity decreases at last on a fast O(10 yr) time scale, precipitating the <b>fall</b> of the <b>overturning.</b> During the last two stages of the instability, the horizontal thermal gradient increases, but its stabilizing effect is just barely unable to prevent the outcome. The return to stability occurs frequently through a regime of multidecadal oscillations with intermittent convection. The hypothesis of mixed boundary conditions has been relaxed by coupling the ocean box model to an atmospheric energy balance model to show that the coupling increases the stability of the oceanic circulation; however, the precursors of the instability are unchanged...|$|R
