25|$|The end {{replication}} {{problem is}} handled in eukaryotic cells by telomere regions and telomerase. Telomeres extend the 3' {{end of the}} parental chromosome beyond the 5' end of the <b>daughter</b> <b>strand.</b> This single-stranded DNA structure can act as an origin of replication that recruits telomerase. Telomerase is a specialized DNA polymerase that consists of multiple protein subunits and an RNA component. The RNA component of telomerase anneals to the single stranded 3' end of the template DNA and contains 1.5 copies of the telomeric sequence. Telomerase contains a protein subunit that is a reverse transcriptase called telomerase reverse transcriptase or TERT. TERT synthesizes DNA {{until the end of}} the template telomerase RNA and then disengages. This process can be repeated as many times as needed with the extension of the 3' end of the parental DNA molecule. This 3' addition provides a template for extension of the 5' end of the <b>daughter</b> <b>strand</b> by lagging strand DNA synthesis. Regulation of telomerase activity is handled by telomere-binding proteins.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{two methods}} for {{repairing}} DSBs depending {{on when the}} damage occurs during mitosis. [...] If the DSB occurs after DNA replication has completed proceeding S phase of the cell cycle, the DSB repair pathway will use homologous recombination by pairing with the newly synthesized <b>daughter</b> <b>strand</b> to repair the break. [...] However, if the DSB is generated prior to synthesis of the sister chromosome, then the template sequence that is required will be absent. [...] For this circumstance, the NHEJ pathway provides a solution for repairing the break and is the main system used to repair DSBs in humans and multicellular eukaryotes. [...] During NHEJ, very short stretches of complementary DNA, 1 bp or more at a time, are hybridized together, and the overhangs are removed. [...] As a result, this specific {{region of the genome}} is permanently lost and the deletion can lead to cancer and premature aging.|$|E
40|$|The {{processes}} for repairing DNA daughter-strand gaps were studied in UV-irradiated uvrB, uvrB recB, uvrB recF, and uvrB recB recF cells of Escherichia coli K- 12. The dimer-containing parental DNA {{was found to}} be joined to <b>daughter</b> <b>strands</b> during postreplication repair in all four strains examined. Therefore, both the major (recF-dependent) and the minor (recF recB-independent) gap-filling processes repair DNA daughter-strand gaps by transferring parental <b>strands</b> into <b>daughter</b> <b>strands...</b>|$|R
25|$|Maintenance {{methylation}} {{activity is}} necessary to preserve DNA methylation after every cellular DNA replication cycle. Without the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), the replication machinery itself would produce <b>daughter</b> <b>strands</b> that are unmethylated and, over time, would lead to passive demethylation. DNMT1 is the proposed maintenance methyltransferase {{that is responsible for}} copying DNA methylation patterns to the <b>daughter</b> <b>strands</b> during DNA replication. Mouse models with both copies of DNMT1 deleted are embryonic lethal at approximately day 9, due to the requirement of DNMT1 activity for development in mammalian cells.|$|R
40|$|The fate {{of parental}} nucleosomes during {{chromatin}} replication was studied in vitro using in vitro assembled chromatin containing the whole SV 40 genome {{as well as}} salt-treated and native SV 40 minichromosomes. In vitro assembled minichromosomes were able to replicate efficiently in vitro, when the DNA was preincubated with T-antigen, a cytosolic S 100 extract and three deoxynucleoside triphosphates prior to chromatin assembly, indicating that the origin has {{to be free of}} nucleosomes for replication initiation. The chromatin structure of the newly synthesized <b>daughter</b> <b>strands</b> in replicating molecules was analysed by psoralen cross-linking of the DNA and by micrococcal nuclease digestion. A 5 - and 10 -fold excess of protein-free competitor DNA present during minichromosome replication traps the segregating histones. In opposition to published data this suggests that the parental histones remain only loosely or not attached to the DNA in the region of the replication fork. Replication in the putative absence of free histones shows that a subnucleosomal particle is randomly assembled on the <b>daughter</b> <b>strands.</b> The data are compatible with the formation of a H 3 /H 4 tetramer complex under these conditions, supporting the notion that under physiological conditions nucleosome core assembly on the newly synthesized <b>daughter</b> <b>strands</b> occurs by the binding of H 2 A/H 2 B dimers to a H 3 /H 4 tetramer complex...|$|R
5000|$|DNA {{polymerase}} reassembles {{its position}} on the template strand and resumes normal replication, but {{during the course of}} reassembling, the polymerase complex backtracks and repeats the insertion of deoxyribonucleotides that were previously added. This results in some repeats found in the template strand being replicated twice into the <b>daughter</b> <b>strand.</b> This expands the replication region with newly inserted nucleotides. The template and the <b>daughter</b> <b>strand</b> can no longer pair correctly.|$|E
5000|$|Bacteriophage RNA {{replicase}} {{keeps the}} template and <b>daughter</b> <b>strand</b> separated during RNA synthesis; duplex RNA {{is not an}} intermediate in RNA synthesis, but an isolation artifact (2).|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to note that the directionality of the newly forming strand (the <b>daughter</b> <b>strand)</b> is opposite to the direction in which DNA polymerase moves along the template strand. Since DNA polymerase requires a free 3' OH group for initiation of synthesis, it can synthesize in only one direction by extending the 3' end of the preexisting nucleotide chain. Hence, DNA polymerase moves along the template strand in a 3'-5' direction, and the <b>daughter</b> <b>strand</b> is formed in a 5'-3' direction. This difference enables the resultant double-strand DNA formed to be composed of two DNA strands that are antiparallel to each other.|$|E
25|$|In {{vertebrate}} cells, replication sites concentrate into positions called replication foci. Replication sites can {{be detected}} by immunostaining <b>daughter</b> <b>strands</b> and replication enzymes and monitoring GFP-tagged replication factors. By these methods {{it is found that}} replication foci of varying size and positions appear in S phase of cell division and their number per nucleus is far smaller than the number of genomic replication forks.|$|R
50|$|A nick is a {{discontinuity}} in {{a double}} stranded DNA molecule {{where there is no}} phosphodiester bond between adjacent nucleotides of one strand typically through damage or enzyme action. Nicks allow for the much-needed release of torsion in the strand during DNA replication. Nicks are also thought {{to play a role in}} the DNA mismatch repair mechanisms that fix errors on both the leading and lagging <b>daughter</b> <b>strands.</b>|$|R
25|$|By {{firing of}} {{replication}} origins, controlled spatially and temporally, {{the formation of}} replication foci is regulated. D. A. Jackson et al.(1998) revealed that neighboring origins fire simultaneously in mammalian cells. Spatial juxtaposition of replication sites brings clustering of replication forks. The clustering do rescue of stalled replication forks and favors normal progress of replication forks. Progress of replication forks is inhibited by many factors; collision with proteins or with complexes binding strongly on DNA, deficiency of dNTPs, nicks on template DNAs and so on. If replication forks stall and the remaining sequences from the stalled forks are not replicated, the <b>daughter</b> <b>strands</b> have nick obtained un-replicated sites. The un-replicated sites on one parent's strand hold the other strand together but not <b>daughter</b> <b>strands.</b> Therefore, the resulting sister chromatids cannot separate {{from each other and}} cannot divide into 2 daughter cells. When neighboring origins fire and a fork from one origin is stalled, fork from other origin access on an opposite direction of the stalled fork and duplicate the un-replicated sites. As other mechanism of the rescue there is application of dormant replication origins that excess origins don't fire in normal DNA replication.|$|R

50|$|DNA is a duplex {{formed by}} two anti-parallel strands. Following Meselson-Stahl, {{the process of}} DNA {{replication}} is semi-conservative, whereby during replication the original DNA duplex is separated into two daughter strands (referred to as the leading and lagging strand templates). Each <b>daughter</b> <b>strand</b> becomes {{part of a new}} DNA duplex. Factors generically referred to as helicases unwind the duplex.|$|E

5000|$|The {{strands of}} a helical DNA duplex, if covalently closed into a {{circular}} structure, are topologically linked, and thus cannot be separated without breaking {{one or both}} strands. This sort of structure {{is referred to as}} [...] "plectonemic". In circular DNA replication, these twists must be removed for the <b>daughter</b> <b>strands</b> to separate. In contrast, the strands of a non-helical DNA duplex would be topologically non-linked, and can be separated without strand breakage. This sort of structure is referred to as [...] "paranemic".|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{study the}} {{segregation}} of two long chains from parallel but randomly twisted start conformations under good solvent conditions using Monte Carlo simulations to mimic chromatin segregation after replication in eukaryotic {{cells in the}} end of prophase. To measure the segregation process, we consider the center-of-mass separation between the two chains and the average square distance between the monomers which were connected before segregation starts. We argue that segregation is dominated by free diffusion of the chains, assuming that untwisting can be achieved by Rouse-like fluctuations on the length scale of a twisted loop. Using scaling analysis, we find that chain dynamics is in very good agreement with the free diffusion hypothesis, and segregation dynamics follows this scaling nearly. Long chains, however, show retardation effects that can be described by a new (to us) dynamical exponent, which is slightly larger than the dynamical exponent for Rouse-like diffusion. Our results indicate that nearly free diffusion of chains during a timescale of a few Rouse-times can lead to segregation of chains. A main obstacle during segregation by free diffusion is random twists between <b>daughter</b> <b>strands.</b> We have calculated the number of twists formed by the <b>daughter</b> <b>strands</b> in the start conformations, which turns out to be rather low and increases only with the square-root of the chain length...|$|R

In strain 23 thy his, inhibition of DNA synthesis by actinomycin D {{was followed by}} partial degradation {{of one of the}} two <b>daughter</b> <b>strands</b> to acid-soluble products. Degradation began at the replication point and proceeded over a distance equal to about 12 % of a chromosome in length. Actinomycin D played some essential part in degradation, since exposure of the cells to other treatments or agents which inhibit growth did not lead to the above result...|$|R
50|$|The {{entire process}} ends past the {{mismatch}} site - i.e., both the site {{itself and its}} surrounding nucleotides are fully excised. The single-strand gap created by the exonuclease can then be repaired by DNA Polymerase III (assisted by single-strand-binding protein), which uses the other strand as a template, and finally sealed by DNA ligase. DNA methylase then rapidly methylates the <b>daughter</b> <b>strand.</b>|$|E

50|$|Robert I. Richards and Grant R. Sutherland called these phenomena, in the {{framework}} of dynamical genetics, dynamic mutations. Triplet expansion is caused by slippage during DNA replication.

40|$|During S {{phase in}} eukaryotes, {{assembly}} of chromatin on <b>daughter</b> <b>strands</b> {{is thought to}} be coupled to DNA replication. However, conflicting evidence exists concerning the role of the highly conserved core histone tail domains in this process. Here we present a novel in vivo labeling technique that was used to examine the role of the amino-terminal tails of the H 2 A/H 2 B dimer in replication-coupled assembly in live cells. Our results show that these domains are dispensable for nuclear import but at least one tail is required for replication-dependent, active assembly of H 2 A/H 2 B dimers into chromatin in vivo...|$|R

Analysis of sites of psoralen intercalation revealed that nucleosomes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae rDNA intergenic spacer are positioned shortly after passage of the replication machinery. Therefore, both the ‘old’ randomly segregated nucleosomes as well as the ‘new’ assembled histone octamers rapidly position themselves (within seconds) on the newly replicated DNA strands, suggesting that the positioning of nucleosomes is an initial step in the chromatin maturation process...|$|R

5000|$|Trinucleotide repeat expansion, {{also known}} as triplet repeat expansion, is the DNA {{mutation}} responsible for causing any type of disorder categorized as a trinucleotide repeat disorder.

50|$|MutS forms a dimer (MutS2) that {{recognises}} the mismatched {{base on the}} <b>daughter</b> <b>strand</b> and binds the mutated DNA. MutH binds at hemimethylated sites {{along the}} daughter DNA, but its action is latent, being activated only upon contact by a MutL dimer (MutL2), which binds the MutS-DNA complex and acts as a mediator between MutS2 and MutH, activating the latter. The DNA is looped out {{to search for the}} nearest d(GATC) methylation site to the mismatch, which could be up to 1 kb away. Upon activation by the MutS-DNA complex, MutH nicks the <b>daughter</b> <b>strand</b> near the hemimethylated site. MutL recruits UvrD helicase (DNA Helicase II) to separate the two strands with a specific 3' to 5' polarity. The entire MutSHL complex then slides along the DNA {{in the direction of the}} mismatch, liberating the strand to be excised as it goes. An exonuclease trails the complex and digests the ss-DNA tail. The exonuclease recruited is dependent on which side of the mismatch MutH incises the strand - 5' or 3'. If the nick made by MutH is on the 5' end of the mismatch, either RecJ or ExoVII (both 5' to 3' exonucleases) is used. If, however, the nick is on the 3' end of the mismatch, ExoI (a 3' to 5' enzyme) is used.|$|E
50|$|Nick idling is a {{biological}} {{process in which}} DNA polymerase may slow or stop its activity of adding bases to a new <b>daughter</b> <b>strand</b> during DNA replication at a nick site. This is particularly relevant to Okazaki fragments in lagging strand in double stranded DNA replication because the direction of replication is opposite to the direction of DNA polymerase, therefore nick idling {{plays a role in}} stalling the complex as it replicates in the reverse direction in small fragments (Okazaki fragments) and has to stop and reposition itself in between each and every fragment length of DNA.|$|E
40|$|The {{advance of}} a DNA {{replication}} fork requires an unwinding of the parental double helix.

The semiconservative model seemed most reasonable since it would allow each <b>daughter</b> <b>strand</b> to remain associated with its template strand.

Cells lacking CAF- 1 accumulated in early and mid S-phase and replicated DNA slowly. The checkpoint kinase Chk 1, but not Chk 2, was phosphorylated in response to CAF- 1 depletion, consistent with a DNA replication defect. CAF- 1 -depleted cell extracts completely lacked DNA replication-coupled chromatin assembly activity, suggesting that CAF- 1 is required for efficient S-phase progression in human cells.
