5|$|Sledd's {{advocacy}} {{of social change}} and an evolving understanding of biblical texts came at a high personal price. Given his chosen career of minister and professor, he never accumulated much personal wealth. Sledd died deep in debt, having lost the family home to <b>foreclosure</b> after the salaries of Candler professors were cut when financial support of the school fell during the Great Depression in the 1930s. His creditors obtained a deficiency judgment for the unpaid portion of his debt after the <b>foreclosure</b> and, following his death, forced the sale {{of some of his}} furniture and parts of his personal library in partial satisfaction of his remaining debts.|$|E

40|$|Housing <b>foreclosures</b> {{likely have}} little {{neighborhood}} impacts {{if there are}} few <b>foreclosures</b> in a neighborhood and the foreclosed housing can resell quickly. However, when there are both many <b>foreclosures</b> and a sluggish housing market, <b>foreclosures</b> can lead to neighborhood destabilization, which should cause house prices to further fall. This paper measures the impact of <b>foreclosures</b> on housing sales using a unique dataset from St. Louis County, Missouri. Results show an expected decline the sales price of neighboring sales but the marginal impact of <b>foreclosures</b> seems to decline {{with an increase in}} the number of <b>foreclosures.</b> These results are robust to a variety of neighborhood control variables and spatial econometric techniques. ...|$|R
40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} the article (may not be free). Despite housing's {{economic}} importance, little has been written on how <b>foreclosures</b> and home prices interact in a framework that includes macroeconomic and housing variables such as employment, permits or sales. Panel VAR results for quarterly state-level data indicate that price-foreclosure linkages run both ways. <b>Foreclosures</b> negatively impact home prices. The negative impact of prices on <b>foreclosures,</b> however, is much larger. These results suggest the low-frequency association observed between <b>foreclosures</b> and prices is mostly driven by the endogenous adjustment of <b>foreclosures</b> to prices via the strategic choices of homeowners and lenders, rather than through the effects of <b>foreclosures</b> on home prices...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} three years, tax <b>foreclosures</b> have risen {{approximately}} 150 % {{in the city of}} Buffalo. While tax <b>foreclosures</b> are spread across the city, they are heavily concentrated in the Masten and Fillmore districts of the city. To combat the increase in tax <b>foreclosures,</b> Buffalo should study the principle causes of tax <b>foreclosures</b> in the area and be prepared to provide financial education classes, payment plans extending for more than one year, and financial assistance to qualified individuals (low to 0 % interest loans). Unfortunately, the lack of definitive information on the causes of tax <b>foreclosures</b> in Buffalo makes it impossible to provide a specific combination/ratio that the city should follow in applying these remedies to prevent tax <b>foreclosures...</b>|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the battle}} waged for {{possession}} of it, the railroad had not been very profitable. Passenger traffic to Wopsononock had been declining, and coal traffic from Dougherty was rather limited. Shellenberger installed a rock crusher atop the mountain, which also provided revenue. A major forest fire destroyed both the Wopsononock Hotel and the coal tipple at Dougherty on April 30, 1903. When the railroad became insolvent again, Shellenberger was appointed receiver on June 4, 1909. It was once more sold under <b>foreclosure</b> on April 30, 1910 to H.A. Davis, and reorganized as the Altoona, Juniata and Northern Railway.|$|E

5|$|Following its sale {{at auction}} {{following}} <b>foreclosure,</b> the Bowers Mansion was abandoned. Eventually purchased by Reno saloon owner Henry Riter, it was renovated and reopened as a resort in 1903. The hot springs were remodeled to feed warm swimming pools, and a spur was built from the Virginia and Truckee Railroad {{to serve the}} property. It continued to operate as a resort until 1946.

40|$|We advance {{scholarship}} {{related to}} home <b>foreclosures</b> and neighborhood crime by employing Granger causality tests and multilevel growth modeling with annual data from Chicago neighborhoods over the 1998 - 2009 period. We find that completed <b>foreclosures</b> temporally lead property crime and not vice versa. More completed <b>foreclosures</b> during a year both increase {{the level of}} property crime and slow its decline subsequently. This relationship is strongest in higher-income, predominantly renter-occupied neighborhoods, contrary to the conventional wisdom.

The 1950s had a tenancy by Mobil, Shell, the Railroad Commission of Texas, and Exxon used the building for their Texas headquarters, before they moved to Houston. The 1960s saw a tenancy by the men's clothing firm Hutchins Brothers in the specially designed Argyle Room as a permanent retail store within the building.|$|E
5|$|The first {{railroad}} track laid through Thistle was a narrow-gauge {{spur line}} servicing coal mines near today's Scofield Reservoir, built in 1878 by the Utah and Pleasant Valley Railway. By 1890, the Denver and Rio Grande Western, which acquired {{the line in}} a <b>foreclosure</b> sale in 1882, had rebuilt the line to standard gauge.

40|$|The federal {{government}} {{responded to the}} <b>foreclosures</b> crisis by implementing several policies. The Neighborhood Stabilization program (NSP) in 2009, a mitigation policy, aimed at helping local governments to buy, rehabilitate and sell foreclosed homes to mitigate {{the effects of the}} <b>foreclosures</b> in the most affected neighborhoods. This paper focuses on the allocation methodology used in this program to explain why some of the most affected places in California didn’t receive adequate funds to fight <b>foreclosures.</b> The initial version of the NSP targeted mainly the largest cities, but left suburban municipalities — yet deeply affected by the <b>foreclosures</b> — with reduced or delayed funds. The use of estimations of <b>foreclosures</b> number to allocate the money, as well as the lack of cooperation between suburban local governments also participated to inefficiently allocate the NSP money, and suggests that urban policies need to be adapted to better fit the change of urban structure in the US...|$|R

5|$|At {{the request}} of {{producer}} John F.S. Laing and director Albert Pyun, the Guam Economic Development and Commerce Authority gave an $800,000 loan guarantee to Laing and his company Guam Motion Pictures Company (GMPC) to secure a third party loan from Comerica Bank in order to finance the film. GMPC was created by Laing on Guam to produce Max Havoc: Curse of the Dragon, while Laing's stateside company, Rigel Entertainment, was to handle distribution. GMPC was also supposed to produce a further theatrical film and two travel documentaries. In June 2006, Laing defaulted on the loan to Comerica and the guarantee was forfeited. The rights to the film were subsequently auctioned by Comerica. A newly formed Canadian company, Up North Entertainment, Inc., bought the film for $83,000. Laing was listed as one of three directors of Up North Entertainment. Guam's share of the <b>foreclosure</b> sale money was $9,090.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} Master Apartments' opening, the {{building}} and the institute both experienced monetary deficits, with the building going into <b>foreclosure</b> in 1932. Two years later, Horch had his tax-exempt corporation, Master Institute of United Arts, Inc., become the building's landlord, with receivership ending the next year in 1935. Soon after, the Horch and Roerich families dissolved their partnership due to disagreements, and the Roeriches unsuccessfully sued Horch to regain control of the Master Apartments. Horch then closed the Roeriches' museum, forcing it to find a new location, and replaced it with the Riverside Museum.
