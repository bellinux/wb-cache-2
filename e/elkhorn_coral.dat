Commonly occurring corals include boulder star coral (Montrastaea annularis), finger coral (Porites porites), and <b>elkhorn</b> <b>coral</b> (Acropora palmata).|$|E
500|$|Beyond {{the keys}} in the Atlantic Ocean the {{seafloor}} slopes gradually down before rising in an almost continuous coral reef. The reef, composed of living corals, is inhabited by more than 200 species of fish, as well as molluscs, crustaceans and worms. Every coral species in park waters is considered protected by either federal or state regulations. Coral reefs are estimated to cover about half {{the area of the}} park, with about 4000 individual patch reefs and areas of bank-barrier reef. Hundreds of species of hard and soft corals, sea anemones and sponges are found in bay and offshore waters. The coral reefs may themselves be subdivided into the outer reef {{on the edge of the}} Florida carbonate platform, the patch reefs between the outer reef and the keys, and the reefs in the shoals on either side of the keys. The offshore reefs are dominated by <b>elkhorn</b> <b>coral</b> to [...] water depth, and staghorn coral below 10 meters. The landward patch reefs are principally composed of boulder star coral and symmetrical brain coral. The island shoal reefs mainly consist of lesser starlet coral and Porites finger corals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Elkhorn</b> <b>corals</b> {{are found}} {{primarily}} in shallow waters with temperatures between 26 and 30 C, and with significant water movement. They {{are one of}} the most abundant species in waters ranging from 1 to 5 m deep, and a few colonies have been reported from waters as deep as 20 m (e.g. Navassa Island).|$|R
50|$|In {{common with}} coral reefs {{throughout}} the Caribbean and the world, the Florida Reef exhibits {{some signs of}} stress and deterioration. Precht and Miller state that the numbers of <b>Elkhorn</b> and Staghorn <b>corals</b> (Acropora ssp.) are declining to an extent that is unprecedented in several thousand years. Between 1981 and 1986, Staghorn corals declined by 96% at Molasses Reef. Between 1983 and 2000 at Looe Key, <b>Elkhorn</b> <b>corals</b> declined by 93% and Staghorn corals by 98%. A joint reef monitoring program conducted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Florida Marine Research Institute and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recorded a loss of 6% to 10% living corals at 40 sampling stations from 1996 to 2000.|$|R

2500|$|In 2002, Pendleton {{published}} a report titled “A Preliminary Study of the Value of Coastal Tourism in Rincon, Puerto Rico” assessing {{the percentage of}} Rincon's income that has coastal tourism as its source. [...] Pendleton stated that [...] "should {{the quality of the}} coastal and ocean resources of the area become impaired, it is likely that a large portion of Rincon's economy will be lost" [...] and estimated the annual income generated by tourism related to coastal and ocean resources to be greater than $51.9 million. [...] The information from this 2002 report has been cited as instrumental to the designation of the Tres Palmas Marine Reserve (in 2008) as a marine protected area, resulting in the protection of “one of the last remaining <b>elkhorn</b> <b>coral</b> reefs in the Caribbean” and the continued status of Rincon as a “surfing epicenter”.|$|E
2500|$|The {{area between}} Hans Lollik and Little Hans Lollik is {{relatively}} shallow and {{is primarily a}} hard bottom with scattered large patches of sand and cobble. [...] Currents flowing between the two islands are generally to the west, and are often quite swift. [...] The shallows along the shores of both islands are colonized by head corals, Diploria strigosa, D. clivosa, Siderastrea siderea, D. labyrinthiformis, Colpophyllia natans, Porites astreoides, Montastraea annularis, M. cavernosa and Dendrogyra cylindrus. [...] There are scattered <b>elkhorn</b> <b>coral</b> Acropora palmata, and staghorn coral A. cervicornis. [...] In the shallower areas, less than 10ft (3 m) most of the Acropora is alive, while deeper there are numerous skeletons of these once massive spreading corals. [...] There are also some very large remnants of Porites porites colonies that lie between the two islands. Some of these mounds are 10 to 12ft (3 to 4 m) in height and width. Agarcia, Millepora, P. porites, {{and a variety of}} sponge species have colonize the dead coral of these mounds. [...] The entire area is destiny colonized by soft coral species and sea plumes, fans feathers are scattered throughout. [...] To the southwest there is a sandy beach, and the sand extends offshore into the bentic environment. [...] Within this sandy area there are emergent areas of rock that have become colonized by corals (Siderastrea and Diploria) and algae. Further offshore there is shallow reef area that is highly impacted by the on coming waves. [...] The reef area supports of variety of soft and hard coral colonization. [...] Along the western side of the island and along the northwestern tip the shoreline is rocky, and the rock extends below the sea. [...] There are large boulders and slabs of rock that lie just below the waters surface along the shore. [...] A diverse community of corals and sponges colonizes this rock substrate that rapidly drops to a depth of 20 to 25ft (6 to 8 m). [...] Head corals (Diploria strigosa, D. clivosa, Sidereastrea siderea, D. labyrinthiformis, Colpophyllia natans, Porites astreoides, Montastrea annularis, M. cavernosa and Dendrogyra cylindrus), branching corals (Acropora palmate, A cervicornis, Porites porites), and fire corals (Millepora spp.) are common within this area.|$|E

On May 4, 2006, <b>elkhorn</b> <b>coral</b> and staghorn coral (A. cervicornis) were officially placed on the Endangered Species List.|$|E
50|$|<b>Elkhorn</b> <b>coral</b> {{was once}} one of the most {{abundant}} species of coral in the Caribbean and the Florida Keys. Since 1980, an estimated 90-95% of <b>elkhorn</b> <b>coral</b> has been lost. Threats include disease, coral bleaching, predation, climate change, storm damage, and human activity. All of these factors have created a synergistic effect that greatly diminishes the survival and reproductive success of <b>elkhorn</b> <b>coral.</b> Natural recovery of coral is a slow process, and may never occur with this species because so many factors inhibit its survival.|$|E

Loggerhead sea turtles, green sea turtles and hawksbill sea turtles nest on the island's beaches. Both white-crowned pigeons and white-tailed tropicbirds nest on the island. Before removal of the crabbing-ground mangroves by a golf development, land crabs such as mountain crabs were common and were hunted for food by the native population.|$|R
5000|$|Since white band {{disease was}} first {{reported}} in the 1970s, the disease {{has led to the}} devastation of approximately 95% of the <b>elkhorn</b> and staghorn <b>corals</b> in the Caribbean region. [...] This resulted in both affected species being listed as threatened under the US Endangered Species Act and as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List. [...] The decline in these corals has a lasting effect on both humans and the environment. [...] Coral reefs protect coastlines from ocean currents, waves, and storms, and the death of these corals only increases the loss of coastlines in affected regions. [...] <b>Elkhorn</b> and staghorn <b>corals</b> are two of the major reef-building corals, the foundation on which the rest of the coral reef is formed. [...] Its loss means the loss of a habitat for many coral reef dwelling species such as lobsters, parrot-fish, snapper shrimps, and many other reef species, causing a sharp decline in the biodiversity of an affected region. [...] Coral reefs are also home to more than twenty-five percent of all marine fish species, making them extremely biologically diverse. [...] The loss of this coral would be particularly damaging to people living on the coast in terms of the food supply, coastal protection, economic security and more. [...] Nearly 500 million people directly depend on coral reefs for food and income (through tourism or otherwise).|$|R
50|$|<b>Elkhorn</b> <b>coral</b> {{exist in}} the Caribbean, the Bahamas, and Florida Keys. Its range reaches {{as far north as}} Biscayne National Park, Florida, and as far south as Curaçao and Venezuela.

50|$|Diseases {{that affect}} <b>elkhorn</b> <b>coral</b> include white pox disease, white band disease, and black band disease. White pox disease, which only affects <b>elkhorn</b> <b>coral,</b> {{is caused by}} a fecal enterobacterium, Serratia marcescens. The disease is very {{contagious}} and commonly moves from one colony to its nearest neighbor. White pox creates white lesions on the coral skeleton and results in an average tissue loss of 2.5 cm2 per day, but can cause as much tissue loss as 10.5 cm2 per day. White band disease and black band disease have also greatly reduced the abundance of <b>elkhorn</b> <b>coral.</b> Diseases are one of the major causes of coral mortality, however, they are not well studied or understood.|$|E
500|$|The park's eastern {{boundary}} {{lies just}} beyond {{the rise of the}} offshore reef at ten-fathom (...) sea depth. Areas farther offshore are protected within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, which extends eastward to a boundary corresponding [...] to a depth of [...] The offshore waters harbor brown pelicans, magnificent frigatebirds, brown boobies, particularly around the offshore lights, [...] and pelagic birds such as shearwaters and petrels. Whales in offshore waters are rare, but can include right whales, humpback whales, sperm whales, fin whales and sei whales, all of them endangered. The smalltooth sawfish is similarly rare in park waters and endangered. Threatened <b>coral</b> species include <b>elkhorn</b> and staghorn <b>corals,</b> as well as pillar coral, listed as endangered in Florida.|$|R
50|$|The long-spined {{sea urchin}} (Diadema antillarum), which browses on seaweed on and around reefs, was sharply reduced in {{numbers on the}} Florida Reef (and {{throughout}} the Caribbean) in the 1980s. While populations of this sea urchin have somewhat recovered elsewhere, its numbers are still very low {{on most of the}} Florida Reef, {{with the exception of the}} Dry Tortugas. As a consequence, there has been no effective check of the growth of seaweed on reef corals. However, the severe die-off of <b>Elkhorn</b> and Staghorn <b>corals</b> occurred before the die-off of the sea urchins, so that the proliferation of seaweed following the loss of the sea urchins was not the cause of the die-off of the corals, but may be retarding recovery by the corals.|$|R
50|$|Elevated {{temperatures}} {{can damage}} coral reefs, causing coral bleaching. The first recorded bleaching incident on the Florida Reef was in 1973. Incidents of bleaching {{have become more}} frequent in recent decades, in correlation with a rise in sea surface temperatures. White band disease has also adversely affected corals on the Florida Reef. While hurricanes often can cause localized damage to <b>Elkhorn</b> and Staghorn <b>corals,</b> Precht and Miller state that the severe and widespread loss of those corals on the Florida Reef cannot be attributed to hurricane damage. Other possible causes of the losses of corals on the Florida Reef include epizootic diseases, eutrophication, predation, sedimentation, overfishing, ship groundings, anchor dragging, commercial lobster and crab traps moved by storms, pollution, development on the Keys, growing numbers of visitors to the Keys and the reefs {{and the growth of}} seaweed on the coral.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Elkhorn</b> <b>coral</b> absorbs much {{carbon dioxide}} {{from the ocean}} every year, {{preventing}} ocean acidification and ocean temperature increases. [...] Upon decomposing, <b>Elkhorn</b> <b>coral</b> releases its sequestered carbon dioxide back into the ocean, heating it and contributing to acidification. [...] White band disease threatens {{more than just the}} coral with its lethal touch. In recent decades, the coral cover in coral reefs has been declining, providing for a transitional increase in the fleshy macroalgae cover in the Caribbean region as more and more filamentous algae colonize inside of the coral skeletons. [...] The death of elkhorn and staghorn corals also substantially reduces coral cover and provides substratum space for further algal growth. [...] Prospects are poor for the recovery of the <b>elkhorn</b> <b>coral,</b> given its asexual method of reproduction, which relies on coral fragments breaking off from the main body and growing in a new area. [...] Staghorn coral also relies on asexual fragmentation as its primary method of reproduction, however, staghorn coral possesses a higher rate of sexual recruitment than <b>Elkhorn</b> <b>coral.</b>|$|E

50|$|Several {{efforts to}} {{conserve}} the <b>elkhorn</b> <b>coral</b> have had mixed results. The Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary {{has served as}} a protected region for the area’s coral species, and has also developed plans for the protection and restoration of <b>elkhorn</b> <b>coral.</b> Restoration efforts have included attempts to reattach coral fragments that were broken off during hurricanes or by ships. Attempts to reattach coral fragments have also occurred in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, but all have had limited success.|$|E
50|$|Acute {{stressors}} can inflict other damage, via unsustainable {{fishing practices}}, boat anchors or accidental groundings. Some fishing practices are destructive to reef habitats, such as bottom trawling, dynamite fishing and cyanide fishing. Ghost fishing (unintended damage from abandoned fishing equipment) harms many coral reefs. Even small-scale fishing can damage reefs if herbivores are not removed and thereby {{not allowed to}} protect reefs from encroachment by algae. Boaters can damage coral by dropping their anchors on reefs instead of sand. Accidental boat groundings can obliterate areas of coral reef. Lettuce corals and branching <b>corals</b> such as <b>elkhorn</b> and finger <b>coral</b> are fragile, but even massive boulder corals can be crushed or broken and turned upside down to die by a sailboat keel. Groundings in sand, or even the churning action of propellers, can cause major localized siltation, indirectly killing adjacent corals.|$|R
40|$|<b>Elkhorn</b> and staghorn <b>corals</b> (Acropora palmata, Acropora cervicornis) {{were listed}} in 2006 as {{threatened}} under the Endangered Species Act. The {{goal of this}} study was to create model potential-habitat maps for A. palmata and A. cervicornis, while identifying areas for possible re-establishment. These maps were created using a database of reported field observations in combination with existing benthic habitat maps. The mapped coral reef and hardbottom classifications throughout Florida, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Island reef tracts were used to generate potential-habitat polygons using buffers that incorporated 95 % and 99 % of reported observations of Acropora spp. Locations of 92 % of A. palmata observations and 84 % of A. cervicornis observations coincided with mapped coral reef or hard-bottom habitat throughout the study area. These results indicate that potential habitat for A. palmata is currently well defined throughout this region, but that potential habitat for A. cervicornis is more variable and has a wider range than that for A. palmata. This study provides a novel method of combining data sets at various geographic spatial scales and may be used to inform and refine the current National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration critical habitat map...|$|R
5000|$|White band {{disease is}} highly {{contagious}} through direct contact between diseased and healthy coral tissue. [...] It {{can also be}} transmitted by the corallivorous snail, {{which means that the}} species consumes coral, Coralliophila abbreviata. [...] C. abbreviata, a species native to the region where <b>Elkhorn</b> and Staghorn <b>corals</b> are found, is able to act as a [...] "reservoir" [...] for white band disease, meaning that it is able to retain the disease pathogen for at least two weeks. [...] However, not all corallivorous snails are able to transmit white band disease (i.e. Coralliophila caribaea). [...] Waterborne transmission of the disease pathogen becomes possible when the coral tissue is lesioned (or otherwise injured). [...] However, the potential for injury among the affected corals tends to be high given the many ways tissue injury may occur naturally including competition by other corals, mechanical damage, or corallivory by snails, damselfish, butterflyfish, fireworms, or other such aquatic organisms. [...] Waterborne transmission helps to explain how the disease spread across the Caribbean so rapidly, given that direct contact between affected corals is limited to physical interaction between the diseased and healthy coral and that the corallivorous snail, C. abbreviata that carries the disease, does not travel across long distances.|$|R
