50|$|The {{bicycles}} are utility bicycles with a unisex step-through {{frame with}} an upright sitting position and {{are equipped with}} 3 speed internal <b>hub</b> gears, <b>drum</b> brakes, fenders, chain guard, lights, and a front rack.|$|R
50|$|From 1976, the T140 had {{hydraulic}} {{disc brakes}} {{for both the}} front and rear wheels. Prior to that date, early versions were equipped with a conical <b>hub</b> rear <b>drum</b> brake. A single leading shoe rear drum brake was specified for the last Bonnevilles proposed by the Meriden factory in 1984 but the factory closed before production. From 1982, twin front brake discs were available as an option.|$|R
5000|$|Until about 2000 Kronan bikes {{were only}} {{available}} in {{a limited number of}} colors, with a single gear and coaster brakes. New models have been added with 3-speed SRAM <b>hub</b> gears and <b>drum</b> brakes.|$|R
5000|$|Drum brakes - a {{drum brake}} has two brake shoes that expand {{out into the}} inside of the <b>hub</b> shell. Rear-mounted <b>drum</b> brakes are often used on tandems to {{supplement}} the rear rim brake and give additional stopping power.|$|R
50|$|A lug nut is a nut {{with one}} rounded or conical (tapered) end, used on steel and most {{aluminum}} wheels. A set of lug nuts are typically used {{to secure a}} wheel to threaded wheel studs and thereby to a vehicle's axles.Some designs (BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Saab, Volkswagen) use lug bolts instead of nuts, which screw into a tapped (threaded) hole in the wheel's <b>hub</b> or <b>drum</b> brake or disc. This configuration {{is commonly known as}} a bolted joint.|$|R
5000|$|Neighborhood Texture Jam is a Memphis, Tennessee {{rock band}} who fuse {{elements}} of punk, industrial and funk into a heavy, rhythmic rock sound. Notable for a member {{responsible for providing}} the [...] "texture" [...] - an ever-changing assembly of 55-gallon oil <b>drums,</b> <b>hub</b> caps, corrugated sheet metal, household appliances and other found objects that serve as auxiliary percussion.|$|R
50|$|Stemco {{was founded}} on March 1, 1951, by Ben Cook and Tom Davidson in St. Charles, MO, and {{originally}} manufactured mufflers and oil reservoirs for commercial trucks. The company moved to Longview, TX, in 1958 to expand the company and began manufacturing new truck parts, including dual wheel adapters, <b>hub</b> hose carriers, <b>drum</b> check gauges and exhaust accessories. This move led {{to an increase in}} production and employee growth. In 1964, Stemco was purchased by Garlock Inc, an industrial sealing company.|$|R
50|$|Press-in studs are {{installed}} {{from the back}} side of the disk or <b>drum</b> <b>hub</b> and may require removal of the hub from the vehicle for installation or removal. They consist of a threaded portion and a larger diameter section, called the knurl, that is splined to prevent rotation. The diameter of the knurl is larger than the hole in the hub requiring a press fit to seat the stud. The stud is prevented from being pulled through the hub by a larger diameter stop on the end.|$|R
50|$|Utility {{bicycles}} often {{feature a}} step-through frame {{so they can}} be easily mounted, single speed, or with internal <b>hub</b> gearing, and <b>drum</b> brakes to reduce the need for maintenance, mudguards to keep the rider's clothing clean, a chain guard to prevent skirts or loose trousers from being caught in the chain, a skirt guard to prevent a long coat or skirt catching in the rear wheel or brakes, a center stand kickstand so it can be parked easily, and a basket or pannier rack to carry personal possessions or shopping bags.|$|R
50|$|The Guardians Drum and Bugle Corps is {{sponsored}} by the Independent Creative Arts Network (ICAN), a 501 (c)(3) musical organization that has a Board of Directors, corps director, and staff assigned to carry out the organization's mission. Johnathon Doerr is the corps director. ICAN announced in April, 2017 its creation of several additional programs: <b>Hub</b> City Guardians <b>Drum</b> and Bugle Corps, a regional corps to be based in Lubbock, Texas; Guardians FX, a unit to compete in Winter Guard International's WGI Winds division; Guardians Drum Corps Academy, an online teaching program for all ICAN programs; Guardians Sprouts, a musical education program for preschool and day care students.|$|R
40|$|John Thousand of Wolverine Western Corp. put his {{aerospace}} {{group to}} work on an unfamiliar job, designing a brake drum using computer design techniques. Computer design involves creation of a mathematical model of a product and analyzing its effectiveness in simulated operation. Technique enables study of performance and structural behavior {{of a number of}} different designs before settling on a final configuration. Wolverine employees attacked a traditional brake drum problem, the sudden buildup of heat during fast and repeated braking. Part of brake drum not confined tends to change its shape under combination of heat, physical pressure and rotational forces, a condition known as bellmouthing. Since bellmouthing is a major factor in braking effectiveness, a solution of problem would be a major advance in automotive engineering. A former NASA employee, now a Wolverine employee, knew of a series of NASA computer programs ideally suited to confronting bellmouthing. Originally developed as aids to rocket engine nozzle design, it's capable of analyzing problems generated in a rocket engine or automotive brake drum by heat, expansion, pressure and rotational forces. Use of these computer programs led to new brake drum concept featuring a more durable axle, and heat transfer ribs, or fins, on <b>hub</b> of <b>drum...</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1954 the Star Twin was redesignated the Shooting Star {{with a new}} {{swinging}} arm frame and the engine further developed by reducing the stroke to 72.6 mm and increasing the bore to 66 mm, giving {{a slight increase in}} capacity to 497 cc. [...] By the end of production in 1961 the BSA Shooting Star was the culmination of the development of the BSA A7, with a deep bottle green colour scheme with light green tank, mudguards and side panels, it had an alloy cylinder head, a duplex cradle frame with {{swinging arm}} rear suspension, full-width light alloy <b>hubs</b> and 8-inch <b>drum</b> brakes. Engine compression was upgraded from 6.6:1 to 7:1 and power was up to [...] at 5800 rpm, with a top speed of just under 90 mph.|$|R
5000|$|The bicycle {{shown in}} three of the photos was one of 5, 22‚Äù frames made for the Burlington Police Department, with the Sachs 7-speed alloy front and rear <b>hubs</b> with dual <b>drum</b> brakes. Only one of these {{bicycles}} was known to have made it to the BPD for testing, the rest were lost, or unaccounted for after the company went out of business. The additional Purple bicycle is a three-speed in its original Commuter Cruiser guise with White Wall tires and sprung seat. The Chicago bicycle was unfortunately ahead of its time,as many people were unwilling to spend more than $200 for what was perceived as a beach cruiser. The Chicago bicycle was much more than that, intended to become a tool to be used to get someone to work, or go for a nice ride on weekends on a trouble-free bicycle.|$|R
