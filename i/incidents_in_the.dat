5|$|As the Armero tragedy was {{exacerbated}} {{by the lack of}} early warnings, unwise land use, and the unpreparedness of nearby communities, the government of Colombia created a special program, the Oficina Nacional para la Atención de Desastres (National Office for Disaster Preparedness), now known as the Dirección de Prevención y Atención de Desastres (Directorate for Disaster Prevention and Preparedness)to prevent such <b>incidents</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{as he did}} <b>incidents</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{order of}} their {{occurrence}} {{without any of the}} historian's pretensions to a thematic organization of his material, he could not feed back the lessons of a changing present into a reinterpreted past. Nor did his devotion to the justification and glorification of Florence permit him to see in the altered fortunes of his city a repetition of the pattern of decline he had illustrated in the histories of the great dynasties of his age.|$|E
5|$|Scotland Yard issued another {{appeal in}} March 2014 for {{information}} {{about a man who}} had entered holiday homes occupied by British families in four <b>incidents</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western Algarve between 2004 and 2006, two of them in Praia da Luz. On those occasions he sexually assaulted five white girls, aged 7–10, in their beds. The man spoke English with a foreign accent and his speech was slow and perhaps slurred. He had short, dark, unkempt hair, tanned skin, and in the view of three victims a distinctive smell; he may have worn a long-sleeved burgundy top, perhaps with a white circle on the back. These were among 12 <b>incidents</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area between 2004 and 2010. The Polícia Judiciária reportedly believed the intruder in the four incidents between 2004 and 2006 was Euclides Monteiro, the former Ocean Club employee from Cape Verde who died in 2009.|$|E

5|$|These {{thoughts}} are employed on various important situations and <b>incidents</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ordinary life of females, and are, in general, dictated with great judgment. Mrs. Wollstonecraft {{appears to have}} reflected maturely on her subject;… while her manner gives authority, her good sense adds irresistible weight to almost all her precepts and remarks. We should therefore recommend these Thoughts as worthy the attention {{of those who are}} more immediately concerned in the education of young ladies.|$|E
5|$|Haydn's {{choice of}} D major for this quartet, {{with the second}} {{movement}} in D minor, optimises the use of open strings and allows for the work to be the loudest and most grandiose of the set. The first movement opens peculiarly: the first violin starts on an E, and proceeds to play a four-measure phrase that concludes with a D major chord. The use of a closing phrase to start the movement {{is the first of}} a number of unsettling <b>incidents</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> movement. The exposition withholds the expected cadence to the dominant almost until the exposition ends. And the movement itself has a tentative pianissimo ending that serves more as a link to the D-minor Adagio than a proper conclusion.|$|E

5|$|Her {{career is}} marked by an unusually, even spectacularly, high degree of {{interpenetration}} between her publicly available private life and her films. The star phenomenon depends upon collapsing {{the distinction between the}} star-as-person and the star-as-performer. This does not usually mean that the incidents of a film's scenario are taken to be actual <b>incidents</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> star's life but rather that they 'reveal' or express the personality of the type-of-person of the star. In the case of Turner, however, not only do her vehicles furnish characters and situations in accord with her off-screen image, but frequently incidents in them echo incidents in her life so {{that by the end of}} her career films like Peyton Place, Imitation of Life, Madame X and Love Has Many Faces seem in parts like mere illustrations of her life.|$|E
5|$|The Netzarim junction, {{where the}} {{shooting}} took place, is {{known locally as}} the al-Shohada (martyrs') junction. It lies on Saladin Road, a few kilometres south of Gaza City. The source of conflict at the junction was the nearby Netzarim settlement, where 60 Israeli families lived until Israel's withdrawal from Gaza in 2005. A military escort accompanied the settlers whenever they left or arrived at the settlement, and an Israeli military outpost, Magen-3, guarded the approach. The area had been the scene of violent <b>incidents</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> days before the shooting.|$|E
5|$|The {{inquiry and}} {{subsequent}} compensation cases found that Rangers had been inept in their administration and complacent after the <b>incidents</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1960s. The disaster also highlighted, however, {{the fact that}} there were no established safety standards that should be adhered to, let alone any means of enforcing such standards. This had been first recommended nearly 50 years earlier, after the 1923 FA Cup Final. The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds was published in 1973, and legislation was enacted with the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. This law cut the capacity of Ibrox to 65,000. In the short term, Rangers took the stopgap measure of installing benches in the North Stand, which was renamed the Centenary Stand.|$|E

5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the war two days earlier, the US forces were attempting to evacuate US civilians and diplomats from the city of Seoul, where a battle was ongoing between North and South Korean forces. Transport aircraft and ships, escorted by US fighter planes, were attempting to bring civilians out of the country as fast as possible. During these missions on June 27, US forces were attacked by North Korean aircraft in two separate <b>incidents</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Seoul area. Despite being outnumbered, the better-built American aircraft outmaneuvered the North Koreans, quickly shooting down half of the attacking force.|$|E
5|$|Fans' {{behaviour}} {{at international}} games {{has led to}} various sanctions against the national team. Croatia was penalized and threatened with expulsion from UEFA for reports of racist behaviour by travelling fans at Euro 2004. UEFA and FIFA have both penalized the Croatian Football Federation (HNS) for similar <b>incidents</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past. During a friendly match against Italy in Livorno, {{a small group of}} Croatia fans formed the shape of a swastika. Croatian fans were also heavily scrutinized for racist behavior against Turkey in 2008, as well as an incident of racial abuse towards English striker Emile Heskey in 2010. During the 2006 World Cup a Croatian fan evaded security at a German venue and approached Croatian players on the field; he was arrested and banned for trespassing. There were also reports of violent clashes between Croatian and Turkish supporters at Euro 2008, as well as improper conduct by Croatia fans at Euro 2012 and the 2014 World Cup.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the State of Connecticut paid $550,000 {{to acquire}} the parcel of land which became Lake Gardner State Park. The land was {{acquired}} from the estate of Carmine Belardo and returned a beach to public service {{that had been a}} private resort for 60 years. The Town of Salem had sought {{to acquire the}} land, but the citizens rejected the plan three times and a state funded grant was rejected in 1994 after the DEP announced the interest in acquiring the property for the state. In 2008, the state spent about $1million to pave the boat launch area and improve parking for 54 vehicles. In 2012, the State of Connecticut was looking to institute parking fees for the park after it experienced several years of increased attendance and <b>incidents</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> park limits. Concerns included littering, unkempt toilets, swimmers going outside the designated zone and police arresting almost three times as many visitors from 2011. In response to the issues, patrols were increased and additional signage was added to inform swimmers. The problems with trash problems and portable toilets ending up in the lake caused concerns for a local advocacy group, Friends of Gardner Lake, and the Gardner Lake Authority which has staff to attend the lake during peak hours.|$|E

5|$|In {{the stories}} he narrates, the Baron is shown as a calm, {{rational}} man, describing what he experiences with simple objectivity; absurd happenings elicit, at most, mild surprise from him, and he shows serious doubt about any unlikely events {{he has not}} witnessed himself. The resulting narrative effect is an ironic tone, encouraging skepticism in the reader and marked by a running undercurrent of subtle social satire. In addition to his fearlessness when hunting and fighting, he is suggested to be a debonair, polite gentleman given to moments of , with a scholarly penchant for knowledge, {{a tendency to be}} pedantically accurate about details in his stories, and a deep appreciation for food and drink of all kinds. The Baron also provides a solid geographical and social context for his narratives, peppering them with topical allusions and satire about recent events; indeed, many of the references in Raspe's original text are to historical <b>incidents</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> real-life Münchhausen's military career.|$|E
5|$|On March 13, the Polish {{government}} {{issued a}} threatening statement accusing Lithuania of provocation. On the following day, the Senate of the Republic of Poland {{called for the}} establishment of diplomatic relations and for the Lithuanian renunciation of claims to Vilnius. Upon receiving news that Poland was considering extreme measures, President Smetona was verging towards agreeing to discuss diplomatic relations, but changed his mind at almost the last minute. On the night of March 14, the Lithuanians, acting through France's envoy to Warsaw, proposed a commission to investigate the shooting incident and to agree on measures to avoid such <b>incidents</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future. This was a partial measure that clearly did not satisfy Poland, which responded by refusing, in the first paragraph of the ultimatum delivered three days later, to establish such a commission. At the same time Lithuanian diplomats approached foreign powers in a bid for international support.|$|E
5|$|Some of his {{selections}} as captain {{were widely}} debated. Following <b>incidents</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean, Trueman {{did not play}} for England again under Hutton's captaincy, although he was still regarded as an England prospect. Jim Laker was also omitted from the team, possibly because Hutton doubted Laker's commitment. Both Jim McConnon, Laker's replacement, and Vic Wilson were controversial choices for the 1954–55 Australian tour, whose selections Trevor Bailey attributed to Hutton; neither played a substantial role on the tour. A poor communicator, Hutton distanced himself from his team when a stronger lead was required. Trueman and Bailey thought Hutton {{found it hard to}} talk to his players: amateur critics considered this an inevitable consequence of a professional leading other professionals. On the other hand, Hutton {{played a key role in}} the development of fast bowlers Trueman, Tyson and Brian Statham. Tyson and Statham later acknowledged his advice and encouragement as factor in their subsequent success. Cowdrey also acknowledged Hutton's advice and assistance when the former began his career. Furthermore, on the 1954–55 tour of Australia, Hutton took a close interest in him and was a particular comfort when Cowdrey's father died during the tour.|$|E
