Upon donning this mask, Link grows to nearly two-and-a-half times his normal height. His clothes turn white and his face appears with a type of war paint on it. The sword that Fierce Deity Link carries is a helix shape that uses magic power to shoot beams at enemies.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{positive}} reactions, reviewers {{brought up}} several {{issues with the}} game. The British video game publication PC Gamer UK was unhappy with the game, claiming that Electronic Arts chose to release a formulaic game {{because it was a}} safer choice than taking The Battle for Middle-earth II in another direction. PC Zone agreed with this view, claiming that although the game looked impressive, it took a by-the-numbers approach towards the real-time strategy genre in a [...] "mindless sort of way", concluding that [...] "in no way is <b>it</b> <b>anywhere</b> near the game we hoped for." [...] The game's multiplayer portion disappointed GameSpy, which found it too unbalanced compared to the heroes, whom they considered to be too strong. Eurogamer considered the game to be of average quality, noting that there were no truly redeeming qualities.|$|E
500|$|Described as [...] "one of {{the most}} talented footballers of his generation", Enda Muldoon has played in {{virtually}} all positions in the forward line, as well as midfield for both his club and county. He is regarded as the complete footballer in that he has impressive high-fielding skills, is hard to dispossess, is very accurate in front of the posts with both feet and covers a lot of ground often tracking back to help in defence. Muldoon has been praised for his vision and ability to pick out pin-point passes, and he is also regarded as a great reader of the game. Ballinderry and Derry team-mate Kevin McGuckin described him as [...] "a magician on the ball and can do anything with it or put <b>it</b> <b>anywhere</b> with his passing". GAA journalist and former Derry player Joe Brolly said of him: [...] "I cannot say I have ever seen a more elegant footballer" [...] and compared him to Kerry football legend Maurice Fitzgerald.|$|E

500|$|Before being {{approached}} by Benioff and Weiss, Martin had had other meetings with other scriptwriters, {{most of them}} wanting {{to turn it into}} a feature film. Martin however deemed it [...] "unfilmable" [...] and impossible to be done as a feature film, stating that the size of one of his novels is as long as The Lord of the Rings, which had been adapted as three feature films. Similarly, Benioff also said that it would be impossible to turn the novels into a feature film as the scale of the novels is too big for a feature film and dozens of characters would have to be discarded. Benioff added, [...] "a fantasy movie of this scope, financed by a major studio, would almost certainly need a PG-13 rating. That means no sex, no blood, no profanity. Fuck that." [...] Martin himself was pleased with the suggestion that they adapt it as an HBO series, saying that he [...] "never imagined <b>it</b> <b>anywhere</b> else".

2500|$|Demand {{for oil in}} Asia {{has been}} growing much faster than in North America or Europe. In 2013, China {{replaced}} the United States as the world's largest importer of crude oil, and its demand continues to grow much faster than its production.

There is sufficient heavy oil refinery capacity in China and India to refine the additional Canadian volume, possibly with some modifications to the refineries.

2500|$|Production {{began in}} November 2000 when LucasArts {{were asked to}} make a game based on [...] {{featuring}} Jango Fett. They presented the game design proposal in March 2001, and development started soon after. Jon Knoles revealed {{in an interview that}} they wanted to develop Jango into the ideal action-based video-game character and that he was to be exciting to watch and fun to play. Secondly they wanted to develop a story that fleshed out Fett's character more fully than in Attack of the Clones, {{while at the same time}} remaining true to the spirit of his character as seen in the film. It was imperative to not dull the game with a slow story and leaden script; as such, their goal was to work a fine balance between back story, narrative, and action-packed gameplay. Knoles said Jango Fett was developed to be an extension of the player's will, the ideal vessel through which the player could live out the fantasy of being the galaxy's most dangerous bounty hunter. His movement and animation blending system was designed to automatically react to other world objects and to never be unable to use his weapons or devices in any situation. The jet-pack was originally designed to be used in areas specifically designed for its use. When the team got it working, they changed their minds and implemented a rechargeable timer on it so the player could use <b>it</b> <b>anywhere</b> for a limited time. At the most, the crew was over fifty people that were working on the game, excluding Industrial Light & Magic (ILM).|$|E
