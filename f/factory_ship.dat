5|$|Following the war, White Star {{refitted}} Suevic, {{adding the}} capacity for 266 second-class passengers, after which {{she returned to her}} Australian route. In March 1924, she completed her 50th voyage on that route. In 1928, though, Suevic was showing her age, and White Star sold her to Yngvar Hvistendahl's Finnhval A/S for £35,000, who renamed her Skytteren and sent her to Germaniawerft at Kiel to be converted into a whaling <b>factory</b> <b>ship.</b> She served with the Norwegian whaling fleets in Antarctic waters. 1936 AS Finnhval came under control of the Norwegian shipping agent Jørgen Krag who handled on behalf of the German Margarine Union. So until the war her hunting results were delivered to Germany.|$|E
5|$|Gigha's coasts {{have seen}} {{numerous}} wrecks. In August 1886 the Staffa ran aground on Cath Sgier west of Craro. The ship {{remained on the}} reef in calm overnight conditions and all crew and 21 passengers were rescued the following morning. On 8 April 1894 the steamship Udea was lost on the same rocks with a cargo of coal and iron. Owned by David MacBrayne, she was en route from Glasgow to Lewis at the time. On 16 September 1940 the British steam liner Aska was bombed by a German aircraft south of Gigha whilst carrying French troops from Gambia. Twelve crewmen died in the attack and 75 survivors were successfully picked up by trawlers. On fire, the Aska drifted onto Cara and was wrecked there. Four years later the Mon Cousu was deliberately sunk in the Sound of Gigha and used for bombing practice. In 1991 the Russian <b>factory</b> <b>ship</b> Kartli was hit by two freak waves off Islay and ran aground at Port Ban after the crew were evacuated. Forty seven crew members were air-lifted to safety but four men {{were killed in the}} accident.|$|E
25|$|Each caught whale is {{secured to}} the side of a whale catcher with rope.

On the flensing deck several workers use specialized tools to butcher the whale. Usable product is delivered to the lower decks of the ship for further processing and refrigerated storage. Non usable product is dumped back into the ocean.|$|E

On 12 February 1913, Pisagua was stranded at Low Island, South Shetland Islands. Although insured for NOK 318,000, she was subsequently condemned and written off {{at a loss to}} her owners.|$|E
25|$|The oldest {{ghost town}} in Antarctica is on Deception Island, where in 1906, a Norwegian-Chilean company {{set up a}} whaling station at Whalers Bay, which they used {{as a base for}} their <b>factory</b> <b>ship,</b> the Gobernador Bories. Other whaling {{operations}} followed suit, and by 1914 there were thirteen factory ships based there. The station ceased to be profitable during the Great Depression, and was abandoned in 1931. In 1969, the station was partially destroyed by a volcanic eruption. There are also many abandoned scientific and military bases in Antarctica, especially in the Antarctic Peninsula.|$|E
50|$|On 17 December the Seekriegsleitung signalled {{that the}} whaling fleet {{was to be}} found in the area around South Georgia and that the names of the Norwegian <b>factory</b> <b>ships</b> {{involved}} were Harpon, Pelagos, Thorshammer, Vestfjord and Ole Wegger. All of the <b>factory</b> <b>ships</b> were under British charter. On Christmas Eve Pinguin intercepted the open-frequency chatter between two of the <b>factory</b> <b>ships</b> Ole Wegger and Pelagos. They learned that the whalers were awaiting a supply ship which was overdue, that Pelagos was short of fuel and that Ole Weggers whale oil tanks were full to capacity. Ole Wegger offered to transfer some of her surplus fuel to Pelagos. Ernst-Felix Krüder decided that they would wait until the two ships were transferring the oil before making any move on them as they would be unmanoeuverable. Another intercepted signal established that the approaching supply ship was the Norwegian whale-oil tanker Solglimt. Solglimt first attended to Thorshammer which was operating 400 miles to the south-west. Ernst-Felix Krüder then decided to wait for Solglimt to arrive. On 13 January 1941 Solglimt arrived and tied up alongside Ole Wegger.|$|R

25|$|Sørvágur {{has always}} been a place where fishery has been very dominant. In older times it was said, that the only thing {{necessary}} for survival in Sørvágur was that you had a fishing rod and a pot to cook the fish. The fishing industry also plays a vital role in the industrial environment in Sørvágur today (2005). Today there is a modern fish factory producing mainly salt fish; a fish farm raising salmon; one fish market; one major fish <b>factory</b> <b>ship,</b> which produces fish directly to the British market; 6 smaller fishing trawlers and 50+ small fishing boats.|$|E
25|$|On 13 February 2008, fire {{destroyed}} the fishing factory {{and the four}} generators that supplied power to the island. On 14 March 2008, new generators were installed and uninterrupted power was restored. This fire was devastating to the island because fishing is a mainstay of the economy. While a new factory was being planned and built, M/V Kelso came to the island and acted as a <b>factory</b> <b>ship,</b> with island fishermen based on board for stints normally of one week. The new facility was ready in July 2009, {{for the start of}} the 2009–10 fishing season.|$|E
25|$|As the IWC enacted {{regulation}} regarding whaling {{a number}} of unregulated operations acting outside {{of the laws of}} member nations became notorious in the mid-late 20th century. For example, a large private whaling fleet was owned (through a variety of holding companies and flags of convenience) by shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis and gained notoriety for ignoring all limits of size and species. When the Peruvian navy finally stopped and seized the Onassis fleet in 1954, and just as sanctions were to be applied, the entire fleet was sold to Japan for $8.5 million. Onassis' <b>factory</b> <b>ship,</b> the Olympic Challenger, was renamed the Kyokuyo Maru II.|$|E

50|$|Technological {{advances}} in fishing such as large <b>factory</b> <b>ships</b> and sonar, {{as well as}} geopolitical disputes over territorial sea and exclusive economic zone (EEZ) boundaries, have led to overfishing and a serious decline in the fish stocks of the Grand Banks from around 1990.|$|R
25|$|Factory {{ships were}} not used by Japan until the 1930s. As whale catches diminished in coastal waters, Japan looked to Antarctica. Toyo Hogei K.K. {{purchased}} the Norwegian <b>factory</b> <b>ship,</b> Antarctic, renaming it the Tonan Maru in 1934. Refrigerator ships were sent along to freeze and transport the meat back to Japan. By capitalizing on both the meat and oil of whales, the Japanese industry continued to out-compete other whaling nations. Improvements in technology such as the world's first diesel-powered whale catcher, the Seki Maru, also increased the capacity to take whales. In the years building up to World War II, the Germans purchased whale oil from Japan and both nations used it in preparation for war.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{compliance}} with fisheries regulations regarding species caught {{and amount of}} the catch could be monitored when the fishing vessel returned to port, but with whaling factory ships, the whales were processed at sea, and the resulting products from all the baleen whales (whale oil, meat) were combined into a single commodity {{by the time the}} whaling ship reached port. As a consequence, a whaling operation that caught a protected right whale could cover up this infraction by combining the meat and oil with that from legal catches and misreporting it as a legal catch of a fin or several minke whales which would yield the same amount of product. Before DNA analysis of meat products became available very recently, such infractions could not be detected when the <b>factory</b> <b>ship</b> returned to port.|$|E
25|$|In 1918, Isfjord {{was sold}} to Kristian Holst, Harstad. She was {{stripped}} of her bowsprit, dismasted and converted to a <b>factory</b> <b>ship,</b> regaining her former name Belgica. From the late 1930s, Belgica {{was used as a}} coal hulk. In April 1940, Belgica was requisitioned by the Franco-British Expeditionary Force for use as a depôt ship storing high explosives. Belgica was scuttled when the Franco-British Expeditionary Force evacuated from Harstad. The Allied evacuation of Harstad took place on 7 and 8 June 1940, and several British ships were also scuttled in order to avoid having them fall into German hands. The wreck of Belgica was discovered at Easter, 1990. Belgicas anchor is an exhibit in the Polar Museum, Tromsø, Norway. The Sør-Troms Museum in Harstad plans to hold an exhibition of artefacts retrieved from Belgica.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, the station at Point Cloates began {{servicing}} Norwegian whaling ships again, but again, closure was {{brought on by}} the start of World War II. Expanded use of <b>factory</b> <b>ships</b> and support chasers also lessened the need for shore based services.|$|R
50|$|Contemporary <b>factory</b> <b>ships</b> {{have their}} {{origins in the}} early whalers. These vessels sailed into remote waters and {{processed}} the whale oil on board, discarding the carcass. Later whalers converted the entire whale into usable products. The efficiency of these ships and the predation they carried out on whales contributed greatly to the animals' steep decline.|$|R
50|$|Poetry was prized for its {{emotional}} {{potential to}} raise the flagging spirits and stir faith in the revolution.

25|$|In {{the evening}} of 9 April Nordkapp intercepted the 6,031-ton German tanker Kattegat of Bremen in the Glomfjorden south of Narvik. Kattegat {{was one of two}} naval tankers the Germans {{intended}} to use in order to quickly refuel the ten destroyers of the Narvik task force, enabling them to escape back to Germany before the Royal Navy could trap and sink them. In preparation of her supply mission, Kattegat had departed the pilot station at Kopervik in Western Norway on 6 April, scheduled to arrive at Narvik on 9 April. The Kriegsmarine support tanker had sailed to Norway from Wilhelmshaven on the German North Sea coast on 3 April in preparation for the invasion. While the other tanker, the 11,766-ton whale oil <b>factory</b> <b>ship</b> Jan Wellem, had reached Narvik from the German Basis Nord at the Bolshaya Zapadnaya Litsa inlet on the Kola Peninsula in Russia before the German attack, the captain of Kattegat had been warned of a British naval mine field in the Vestfjorden (Operation Wilfred) and refused to continue, choosing instead to anchor up in Sandlågbukta, Neverdal at Ørnes in Meløy.|$|E
