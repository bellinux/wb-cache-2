2500|$|New monitor {{configuration}} APIs make {{it possible}} to adjust the monitor's display area, save and restore <b>display</b> <b>settings,</b> calibrate color and use vendor-specific monitor features. Overall too, Windows Vista is designed to be more resolution-independent than its predecessors, with a particular focus on higher resolutions and high DPI displays [...] Windows Presentation Foundation and WPF applications are fully resolution-independent. Also, Transient Multimon Manager, a new feature that uses the monitor's EDID enables automatic detection, setup and proper configuration of additional or multiple displays as they are attached and removed, on the fly. The settings are saved on a per-display basis when possible, so that users can move among multiple displays with no manual configuration.|$|E

2500|$|The Authors Guild, the {{publishing}} industry and Google entered into a settlement agreement October 28, 2008, with Google agreeing to pay a total of $125million to rights-holders of books they had scanned, to cover the plaintiffs' court costs, {{and to create a}} Book Rights Registry. The settlement was set to be approved by the court sometime after October 2009. Reaction to the settlement was mixed, with Harvard Library, one of the original contributing libraries to Google Library, choosing to withdraw its partnership with Google if [...] "more reasonable terms" [...] could not be found. As part of the $125million settlement signed in October 2008, Google created a Google Book Settlement web site that went active on February 11, 2009. This site allowed authors and other rights holders of out-of-print (but copyright) books to submit a claim by June 5, 2010. In return they were to receive $60 per full book, or $5 to $15 for partial works. In return, Google was to be able to index the books and display snippets in search results, as well as up to 20% of each book in preview mode. Google was also to be able to show ads on these pages and make available for sale digital versions of each book. Authors and copyright holders were to receive 63 percent of all advertising and e-commerce revenues associated with their works. After claiming a book, rightsholders would also have the ability to alter the default <b>display</b> <b>settings.</b>|$|E

There was also a [...] "Show Properties" [...] key used to <b>display</b> <b>settings,</b> called property sheets, for the particular object (e.g., font size for a character object).

40|$|Objective: Effects {{of display}} size and dual display setting on {{preferred}} display and keyboard positions were evaluated. Background: User-preferred display position may vary as its size changes or when multiple displays are used. It {{is also not}} known whether the use of larger displays or multiple displays would influence positioning of the keyboard. Method: Participants (N = 19) who had normal visual acuity (20 / 30 or better) determined preferred positions of the display and the keyboard during a data entry task in four display setups (19, 24, 27. 5, and dual 19 in.). The size of capital characters (3. 2 mm high) was kept consistent between setups. Results: Preferred viewing distance ranged from 0. 68 m (19 -in. display) to 0. 76 m (27. 5 -in. display). No significant differences in viewing distance and display height {{were found between the}} single 19 -in. display and dual 19 -in. displays setups. The preferred position of the keyboard was consistent between display setups. Conclusion: Participants placed larger displays farther and lower while maintaining the display top at or near eye height. Preferred position of the dual displays in landscape setting did not differ from that of a single display. It appears that the preferred display position varies with the vertical dimension of the overall viewable area of the display. Application: The results of this study can be used to determine the dimensions or adjustability of computer workstations for larger displays or multiple <b>displays</b> <b>settings.</b> close 6...|$|R
