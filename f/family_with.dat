40|$|The {{state may}} provide {{financial}} assistance to <b>families</b> <b>with</b> dependent children either by reducing their tax burden or by increasing their welfare benefits. Both means of support increase their net wage, thus providing financial support. This paper {{provides an overview of}} financial support amounts provided to <b>families</b> <b>with</b> dependent children or <b>families</b> <b>with</b> the youngest child aged 1 to 3, and of measures limiting such support. The lower tax burden of <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children ensues from lower income tax, not from the social and health care security systems. Within this system, tax support provided to <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children is comparable to that provided to low-income families without children. Additional support provided to <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children includes tax benefits tied directly to children in the family, and tax credit for a dependent spouse. Should the tax system not provide such benefits, <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children, or rather <b>families</b> <b>with</b> a youngest child aged 1 to 3 would have a higher effective tax rate than childless <b>families</b> <b>with</b> comparable income...|$|R

40|$|Preterm birth has a {{critical}} influence on interactive, communicative, and expressive child behaviour, {{particularly during the}} first years of life. Few studies have stressed the assessment of mother-father-child interaction in <b>families</b> <b>with</b> preterm children, generating contradictory results. The present study wished to develop these fields: (i) comparing the quality of family interactions between <b>families</b> <b>with</b> preterm children and <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children born at full term; (ii) observing the development of family interactions after six months in the <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children born preterm; (iii) assessing family and contextual factors, as parental stress and social support, in parents of preterm children in order to observe their influence on the quality of family interactions. 78 families are recruited: 39 <b>families</b> <b>with</b> preterm children (= 19, 8 months, SD = 11, 05) and 39 <b>families</b> <b>with</b> full-term children (= 19, 66 months; SD = 13, 10). Results show that <b>families</b> <b>with</b> preterm children display a low quality of mother-father-child interactions.

40|$|Generalised {{epilepsy}} with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) is {{the most}} studied familial epilepsy syndrome. However, characteristics of UK families have not previously been reported. Among the first 80 families recruited to our families study, four broad subphenotypes were identified: <b>families</b> <b>with</b> classical GEFS+; <b>families</b> <b>with</b> borderline GEFS+; <b>families</b> <b>with</b> unclassified epilepsy; and <b>families</b> <b>with</b> an alternative syndromal diagnosis. Borderline GEFS+ families shared many characteristics of classical GEFS+ families—such as prominent febrile seizures plus and early onset febrile seizures—but included more adults with focal epilepsies (rather than the idiopathic generalised epilepsies predominating in GEFS+) and double the prevalence of migraine. Thus the authors believe that a novel and robust familial epilepsy phenotype has been identified. Subcategorising <b>families</b> <b>with</b> epilepsy is helpful in targeting both clinical and research resources. Most <b>families</b> <b>with</b> GEFS+ have no identified causal mutation, and so predicting genetic homogeneity by identifying endophenotypes becomes more important...|$|R

40|$|Governments usually {{try to use}} fiscal {{instruments}} to support the <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children. However, {{fiscal instruments}} also affect the work effort and labour demand.

The results of the analysis show that the vast majority of developed countries strongly support the <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children via fiscal instruments. It also turns out that over the past decade the governments have rather reduced effective taxation of the <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children.

40|$|A {{topic of}} the {{bachelor}} thesis is "Typology of services dealing with a care for families and their significance". The care for <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children is currently a hot topic that affects the entire social system, from lawmakers to client families which attend NGOs. Just NGOs provide {{a large amount of}} the services dealing <b>with</b> the <b>family</b> issues. The bachelor thesis theoretically and practically deals with aspects concerning services for <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children. A goal of the thesis was to map the services for <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children in Plzeň and České Budějovice and to compare an offer and demand for these services in chosen towns. Quantitative and qualitative research strategies were chosen to meet objectives. Through a questionnaire there were obtained data about organizations providing services for the <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children in organizations towns of České Budějovice and Plzeň for the cooperation. The basic sample for the qualitative research consisted of managers from organizations in České Budějovice and Plzeň or their representatives. A semi-standardized interview was conducted with both target groups. Before the beginning of the research I set following research questions: Does the current range of offered services for the <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children in Plzeň correspond to the demand for them? Does the current offer of services for the <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children in České Budějovice correspond to the demand for those services? Is the offer of services for the <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children in Plzeň greater than in České Budějovice? What kind of services for the <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children are missing in Plzeň? What kind of services for the <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children are missing in České Budějovice? The research showed that there are more organizations providing services for the <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children in Plzeň than in České Budějovice, but the demand is greater than offer yet. The question of the offer and demand for the services for the <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children is currently in both towns sufficient, but representatives from all organizations expressed their concern for the future in connection with a constantly increasing number of the client families compared to previous years. Results of the thesis include a typology of the services which are missing in the towns and so they can contribute to an origination of new organizations able to cover and ensure a complexity of the services for the <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children in Plzeň and České Budějovice...|$|R
