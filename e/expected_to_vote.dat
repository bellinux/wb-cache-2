5|$|This tactic did {{not prove}} successful: pro-Nazi {{propaganda}} and protests were rampant, {{even among the}} Lithuanian population, and the local government was powerless to prevent them. The Nazis physically harassed Lithuanian organizations. On 1 November 1938 Lithuania was pressured into lifting martial law and press censorship. During the December elections to the Klaipėda Parliament, pro-German parties received 87% of votes (25 seats out of 29) in the Klaipėda territory. Dr. Ernst Neumann, the chief defendant in the 1934 trials, {{was released from prison}} in February 1938 and became the leader of Klaipėda's pro-German movement. In December he was received by Adolf Hitler, who assured him that the Klaipėda issue would be resolved by March or April 1939. Neumann and other Nazi activists claimed the right of self-determination for the region and demanded that Lithuania open negotiations over the political status of Klaipėda. The parliament was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> for a return to Germany when it convened on 25 March 1939. Germany's official channels maintained silence on the issue. Germany hoped that Lithuania would voluntarily give up the troubled region, and a public stance could have disturbed the sensitive discussions it was then engaged in with Poland over an anti-Communist alliance against the Soviet Union.|$|E

The CHP's 133 MPs and the two independents, which consisted of Aylin Nazlıaka and Ümit Özdağ, voted 'No' while the HDP boycotted the votes.|$|E
25|$|Under party rules, any Liberal MP or senator can {{propose a}} motion to spill the party's leadership. The leader of the party then invites a {{discussion}} of the motion at a party room meeting, and makes a decision whether to call a vote on the matter based on the sentiments which are expressed. The leader can also choose to conduct this vote through a public show of hands or a secret ballot. Abbott stated, before the ballot, that it would be conducted in secret, as has previously occurred. By convention, Liberal Party ministers are <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> against conducting leadership spills.|$|E

25|$|Hiss {{drafted a}} {{memorandum}} arguing against Stalin's proposal (made at Dumbarton Oaks) {{to give one}} vote {{to each of the}} sixteen Soviet republics in the U.N. General Assembly. Fearing isolation, Stalin hoped thus to counterbalance the votes of the many countries of the British Empire, who he anticipated would vote with Britain, and those of Latin America, who could be <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> in lockstep with the United States. In the final compromise offered by Roosevelt and Stettinius and accepted by Stalin, the Soviets obtained three votes: one each for the Soviet Union itself, the Ukrainian SSR, and the Belorussian SSR.|$|E
25|$|As per the {{principle}} of cabinet solidarity, all cabinet ministers were <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> in favour of government-introduced legislation. While backbench MPs in 2003, six future cabinet ministers voted in favour of a Canadian Alliance motion defining marriage in exclusively traditional terms. Joe Comuzzi decided to leave cabinet in order to vote against SSM. John Efford, a cabinet minister who recently opposed SSM decided to vote in favour of C-38. Former Liberal MP Pat O'Brien said he was personally told by six ministers that they may leave the cabinet rather than support SSM legislation, but this did not happen. Stephen Harper has pressured Paul Martin to allow his cabinet members a free vote, citing the precedent of Brian Mulroney in a capital punishment vote in 1988.|$|E
25|$|According to the constitution, {{members of}} the {{assembly}} represent the entire country, not the constituency from which they are elected. This directive has been reinforced in practice by the strong role of political parties in regard to {{members of the}} assembly. Party leadership, for example, determines in which areas candidates are to run for office, thus often weakening members' ties to their constituencies. Moreover, members of the assembly are <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> with their party and to work within parliamentary groups based on party membership. Party discipline is strong, and insubordinate members can be coerced through a variety of means. A further obstacle to members' independence is that their bills first have to be submitted to the parliamentary groups, and it is these groups' leaders who set the assembly's agenda.|$|E

Dilworth's fears of fraud did not come to pass, but {{the election}} for City Controller did go to the Republicans.

500|$|Many constituencies, {{especially}} those with small electorates, were {{under the control of}} rich landowners, and were known as nomination boroughs or pocket boroughs, because they were said to be in the pockets of their patrons. Most patrons were noblemen or landed gentry who could use their local influence, prestige, and wealth to sway the voters. This was particularly true in rural counties, and in small boroughs situated near a large landed estate. Some noblemen even controlled multiple constituencies: for example, the Duke of Norfolk controlled eleven, while the Earl of Lonsdale controlled nine. Writing in 1821, Sydney Smith proclaimed that [...] "The country belongs to the Duke of Rutland, Lord Lonsdale, the Duke of Newcastle, and about twenty other holders of boroughs. They are our masters!" [...] T. H. B. Oldfield claimed in his Representative History of Great Britain and Ireland that, out of the 514 members representing England and Wales, about 370 were selected by nearly 180 patrons. A member who represented a pocket borough was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> as his patron ordered, or else lose his seat at the next election.|$|E

To be able to vote, his bodyguards suggested Puigdemont to switch cars in a tunnel, and by doing so he managed to vote in Cornella del Terri. Several other polling stations where public figures had to vote were also raided, for example the buildings where Carme Forcadell or the Mayor of Sabadell was registered.|$|E

2500|$|Under Miller's direction, City Manager Shirley Hoy {{implemented}} $34-million {{in service}} {{cuts to the}} 2007 budget in August 2007 without seeking council approval. Miller's spokesperson defended the move, saying [...] "we’ve got a serious financial shortfall {{that has to be}} addressed". The North York and Etobicoke community councils passed motions, by 9-1 and 6-1 majorities respectively, asking Toronto council to stop its plan to close community centres on Mondays and delay the opening of ice rinks. The North York motion was tabled by David Shiner, but two allies of the Mayor Howard Moscoe and John Filion voted for it, with Shelley Carroll as the lone dissenter. Based upon interviews, a majority of councillors are <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> to reverse the controversial cuts at the next meeting scheduled for September 26. Ashton suggested that [...] "'s grip is slipping" [...] and [...] "It’s like the emperor is doing a slow striptease".

2500|$|Ahead of {{the annual}} Board of Governors meeting where they were <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> on {{approval}} of {{the sale of the}} Kings to Hansen and Ballmer's group, as well as the relocation request, members of the NBA owners' finance and relocation committees held a meeting in New York City on April 3, 2013, for the Seattle group and the Sacramento group to each present their proposals. Any vote would only be on the PSA presented by Hansen and Ballmer, and the Sacramento proposal was considered a [...] "backup offer". Coming out of that meeting, the NBA removed the vote from the agenda of the BOG meeting and postponed it for two weeks while information was reviewed. Despite stated desires to the contrary, a bidding war began between Hansen's and Ranadivé's groups, including Hansen raising the team valuation of their offer twice from $525 million to $550 million to $625 million, and Ranadivé offering to forgo the team revenue sharing that has frequently kept smaller market teams like the Kings financially stable.|$|E

McCarey beamed as his picture won award after award and when he was named Best Director, Wilder could no longer take it. When McCarey got up to make his way to the stage to accept the award for best picture, Wilder, sitting on the aisle, stuck out his foot and tripped him.
