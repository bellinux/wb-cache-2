"The ashes {{were still}} warm, and I guess {{they had left}} about four hours afore I arrived; so I went on more carefully, knowing that if I threw away my life {{there was no chance}} of {{recovering}} the gal.

Not daring to wade upright, on account of the noise made by floundering and by the suck of the mud, I remained lying down in the mud and propelled myself over its surface by means of my hands. Still keeping the trail made by the Chinese in going from and to the junk, I held on until I reached the water.

50|$|It seems {{impossible}} {{to answer this}} question.

Therefore, while H. and W. went to the latter, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> to the inn, amid their cries and reproaches. I waved my cap and made a bow. A glacier!--go five rods farther to see a glacier! Catch me in any such folly.

60|$|The mysterious {{stranger}} {{had evidently}} but just retired. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off,</b> sorely disappointed, to my room, {{which had been}} changed {{to the front of}} the house. As I went along the corridor, I saw a large pair of boots, with dirty, waxed tops, standing at the door of a bed-chamber. They doubtless belonged to the unknown; but it would not do to disturb so redoubtable a personage in his den; he might discharge a pistol, or something worse, at my head. I went to bed, therefore, and lay awake half the night in a terrible nervous state; and even when I fell asleep, I was still haunted in my dreams by the idea of the stout gentleman and his wax-topped boots.|$|E

"To proceed by land {{through the}} marshes at night was impossible, but I found my coracle, {{which we had}} hidden under the bushes, and poled up the channel after the Romans, who were now some {{distance}} ahead.

60|$|After {{pursuing}} {{the road for}} about three miles, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> into a footpath, which led along the borders of fields and under hedgerows to a private gate of the park; there was a stile, however, {{for the benefit of}} the pedestrian, there being a public right of way through the grounds. I delight in these hospitable estates, in which every one has a kind of property--at least as far as the footpath is concerned. It in some measure reconciles a poor man to his lot, and, what is more, to the better lot of his neighbor, thus to have parks and pleasure-grounds thrown open for his recreation. He breathes the pure air as freely and lolls as luxuriously under the shade as the lord of the soil; and if he has not the privilege of calling all that he sees his own, he has not, at the same time, the trouble of paying for it and keeping it in order.|$|E
60|$|I had not run far {{when the}} growl of a lion, {{apparently}} in front, {{caused me to}} stop abruptly.

But my next step showed me that the lion was otherwise engaged. Pushing aside a few leaves that obstructed my vision, I suddenly beheld a lion {{in the midst of an}} open space, crouched as if for a spring. Instinctively I threw forward the muzzle of my rifle; but a single glance showed me that his tail, not his head, was towards me. On looking beyond, I observed the head and shoulders of Jack, who, like the lion, was also in a crouching position, staring fixedly in the face of his foe. They were both perfectly motionless, and there could not have been more than fifteen or twenty yards between them.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} random medium access {{schemes for}} devices that support sleep modes, <b>i.</b> e. <b>turning</b> <b>off</b> electronic compartments for energy saving. Due to hardware limitations, sleep mode transitions cannot {{occur at the}} medium access timescale. Each terminal can choose when to turn on/off and its probability to transmit on an arbitrary slot. Thus, we develop a two level model, consisting of a fast timescale for transmission scheduling and a slower timescale for the sleep mode transitions. We take a game theoretic approach to model the user interactions and show that the energy constraints modify the medium access problem significantly, decreasing the price of anarchy. Our results give valuable insights on the energy-throughput tradeoff for contention based systems...|$|R
