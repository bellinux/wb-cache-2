40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of measured <b>directional</b> <b>seas</b> using a nonlinear model, named Directional Hybrid Wave Model (DHWM). The model has the capability of decomposing the directional wave field into its free wave components with different frequency, amplitude, direction and initial phase based on three or more time series of measured wave properties. With the information of free waves, the DHWM can predict wave properties accurately {{up to the second}} order in wave steepness. In this study, the DHWM is applied to the analyses of the data of Wave Crest Sensor Inter-comparison Study (WACSIS). The consistency between the measurements collected by different sensors in the WACSIS project was examined to ensure the data quality. The wave characteristics at the locations of selected sensors were predicted in time domain and were compared with those recorded at the same location. The degree of agreement between the predictions and the related measurements is an indicator of the consistency among different sensors. To analyze the <b>directional</b> <b>seas</b> in the presence of strong current, the original DHWM was extended to consider the Doppler effects of steady and uniform currents on the directional wave field. The advantage of extended DHWM originates from the use of the intrinsic frequency instead of the apparent frequency to determine the corresponding wavenumber and transfer functions relating wave pressure and velocities to elevation. Furthermore, a new approach is proposed to render the accurate and consistent estimates of the energy spreading parameter and mean wave direction of <b>directional</b> <b>seas</b> based on a cosine- 2 s model. In this approach, a Maximum Likelihood Method (MLM) is employed. Because it is more tolerant of errors in the estimated cross spectrum than a Directional Fourier Transfer (DFT) used in the conventional approach, the proposed approach is able to estimate the directional spreading parameters more accurately and consistently, which is confirmed by applying the proposed and conventional approach, respectively, to the time series generated by numerical simulation and recorded during the WACSIS project...|$|R

Indeed, wind-generated waves in the ocean have obviously different amplitudes and frequencies, but also come from different directions. Consequently, the distribution of energy with respect to wave direction, which is commonly known as the directional spectrum, is very important in the design of submerged or semi-submersible structures. The use of <b>directional</b> <b>seas</b> in design provides a better representation of the ocean surface and a basis for minimizing the over-design of offshore structures. This study examines the means of generation of such types of environments in the wave basin of the Offshore Technology Research Center. Series of tests, {{for a wide variety of}} multi-directional waves, are conducted in order to gather data from wave elevation recorders at different locations in the tank. Drive signals for the pacemaker are computed according to the wave elevation variance table of the sea state to be simulated. Matlab programs, using several spreading functions, are used to prepare the input files. The analysis of the data relies on complex techniques, which will be implemented through the use of either Dr. Borgman's program NUSPEC or the GEDAP analysis software package used at the center. A large part of the results will be presented as contour and three-dimensional graphs, that allows thereafter to compare the different models and also draw some conclusions about the limits of each technique.

In unidirectional flows the association of a significant history term with vortex shedding is confirmed by the occurrence of a prominent transverse or lift force.

40|$|International audienceWe present {{simplified}} expressions for the cross-polarized backscatter of a randomly {{rough surface}} {{predicted by the}} second-order small-slope approximation (SSA 2). The simplification is based on appropriate polynomial approximations of the SSA 2 kernel function. We obtain numerically efficient expressions for the cross-polarized backscattering amplitude of a deterministic surface {{in the form of}} a single space integral involving only the surface elevation and the second (mixed) derivative of the surface elevation. The ensemble average normalized radar cross section is then derived under a Gaussian random process assumption for the surface. The resulting expression has the form of a Kirchhoff integral involving the roughness correlation function and its second- and fourth-order cross-derivatives. Further simplification is achieved for off-nadir observations using a high-frequency approximation; the result is an analytical formula involving only the resonant curvature and the radar-filtered mean square slope in the out-of-plane direction. A numerical validation of the simplified expressions is provided by comparison with exact SSA 2 predictions in representative test cases.

In addition, a discussion is included of the influence of abnormal waves on ship responses. Overall the wireless sensor network shows significant potential for obtaining responses a ship in a range of sea states.

40|$|Accurate {{predictions}} of the annual energy yield from wave energy converters {{are essential to the}} development of the wave industry. The current method based on power matrices uses only a small part of the data available from sea state estimations and it is consequently prone to inaccuracies. The research presented in this work investigates the issue of energy yield prediction and questions the power matrix method. This is accomplished by quantifying the influence of several <b>directional</b> <b>sea</b> states parameters on the performances of wave energy converters. The approach taken was to test several wave energy converters in the Edinburgh Curved tank with a large set of sea states. The selected wave energy converters are a fix OWC, a set of two OWCs acting as a weak directional device and the desalination duck model. Uni-modal and bi-modal sea states were used. For the uni-modal sea states, parameters related to the wave system shape were considered. For the bi-modal sea states, the relative position of the wave system peaks was investigated and the uni-modality index was introduced to quantify the degree to which sea states could be considered bi-modal. For all sea states, the significant wave height was kept constant. The experimental work required good spectral estimates. The MLM and MMLM were adapted to deterministic waves to improve their stability and accuracy. A routine to isolate wave systems was also developed in order to estimate parameters with respect to each wave systems. For uni-modal spectra, parametric models of the observed performances of the devices could be devised. The frequency spreading and its interaction with the energy period proved to be as important as the energy period itself, which suggests that the frequency spreading should be used for energy production prediction.

40|$|A {{new set of}} {{laboratory}} experiments to examine the short-term statistics of crest elevation and wave heights has been undertaken. Sea states {{with a range of}} steepness and directional spreading have been considered. Comparisons between these data and a number of widely adopted short-term statistical models exhibit clearly defined departures. For a given sea state, the extent of these departures is directly proportional to the sea state steepness and inversely proportional to the directional spread. With directional spreading identified as a critical parameter, a detailed study of how best to describe, define and model it has been undertaken. The key finding {{of this study is that}} the average directional spread in the steepest sea states reduces. In addition, it has also been shown that on average the largest waves in these steep sea states are more uni-directional when compared to the sea state as a whole. Further consideration of the data show that the two physical mechanisms leading to the alteration of the statistics are nonlinear amplification (leading to increases above second-order) and the dissipative effect of wave breaking. Quantification of the effects arising from these two competing mechanisms has been undertaken based on additional simulations (both numerical and experimental) of focused wave groups. For uni-directional sea states, a classical expansion (truncated at a third order of wave steepness) of the increased surface elevation obtained in a fully nonlinear uni-directional focused wave group has been used to quantify the effect of amplification in the crest height statistics. Similarly, the dissipative effect of wave breaking on crest elevations has been quantified based on the reduction in crest elevations in focused wave groups with linear amplitude sum larger than the limit at which incipient spilling first occurs. These reductions are calculated as the difference in the maximum crest elevation in a breaking wave event and that predicted by the third-order power series used for the quantification of nonlinear amplificiation. Overall the two methods employed in quantifying the effect of nonlinear amplification and wave breaking yield good agreement with the original (random) laboratory data. Finally, directionality is incorporated into these predictions based on the linear reduction in the wave front steepness with increasing directional spread. Both the nonlinear amplification and the dissipative effect of wave breaking are calculated based on this reduced steepness for the <b>directional</b> <b>sea</b> states. The predicted crest heights from this simplified procedure compare well with the laboratory data; the predictions remaining conservative throughout. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|It is {{challenging}} to obtain accurate predictions of ocean surface wavefield evolutions due to several complex dynamic processes involved, including nonlinear wave interaction, wave breaking and wind forcing, and also wave interactions with currents and bottom bathymetry. With fast computational algorithms for nonlinear phase-resolved wave simulations and modern computational capabilities, we now develop and apply a direct large-scale nonlinear phase-resolved wavefield simulation tool, {{which we call}} SNOW (Simulation of Nonlinear Ocean Wavefields), to study the evolution of directional ocean waves and occurrence of rogue waves (extremely large waves). Using SNOW, we obtain an ensemble of nonlinear deep-water wavefield simulations, initialized by JONSWAP spectrum with {{a broad range of}} spectral parameters, over large space-time scales. Spectral evolutions, nonlinear wave statistics and rogue wave occurrence are investigated based on the simulated wavefields. The SNOW results are compared to available wave basin experiments and predictions from linear theory and approximate nonlinear-Schr 6 dinger-equation (NLS) type models. SNOW predictions give an overall better comparison with wave-basin experiments than NLStype model predictions. For initially narrow-banded and narrow-directional-spreading wavefields, we find modulational instability develops over short time, resulting in considerable spectral broadening, strongly non-Gaussian statistics and probability of rogue wave occurrence an order of magnitude higher than linear theory prediction. For longer time, the wave spectrum in SNOW simulations reaches a non-Gaussian quasi-stationary state, and this is not predicted by NLS-type models, where a continuous spectral broadening is observed. When waves spread broadly in frequency and direction, the modulational-instability effect is reduced and the wave statistics and rogue wave probability are close to linear theory prediction. Number and area-based probabilities are introduced to measure the likelihood of rogue wave occurrence. To effectively predict rogue wave occurrence in <b>directional</b> <b>seas,</b> we propose a new modified Benjamin-Feir index (MBFI), which accounts for the effects of wave directionality. It is shown that the occurrence probabilities of rogue waves are well correlated with MBFI over a broad range of spectral parameters. Based on a large catalogue of rogue waves found from SNOW simulations, the geometric shapes of rogue waves are analyzed using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). It is found that rogue wave profiles can generally be described by a small number of POD modes. SNOW simulations are also used to investigate the influence of finite depth on the evolution of nonlinear wavefields. As water depth decreases, the modulational instability decreases and finally diminishes. It is found that the occurrence probability of rogue waves and wave kurtosis decrease as water depth decreases. The wave statistics and rogue wave occurrence in bimodal wavefields are also studied. The influence of swell on the wave statistics of single-modal wind sea is not monotonic. The occurrence probability of rogue waves can either increase or decrease depending on the bimodal spectrum shape. We find the rogue wave probability and wave kurtosis are minimized when the propagation directions of swell and wind sea are orthogonal. By assimilating wave measurements from in-situ buoy and/or remote sensing into SNOW, we develop and demonstrate the capability of phase-resolved reconstruction and forecasting of wavefield evolution and rogue wave occurrence. Such capability could significantly enhance marine design and operation. This research paves the way for a new-generation wave forecasting model that is capable of providing heretofore unavailable large-scale phase-resolved information on the ocean wave evolution. Such capability is critically useful such as in the understanding of rogue wave dynamics and in the practical marine operations and safety. by Wenting Xiao. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Supporting calculations are provided to establish the best method of directional wave generation, the preferred method of directional analysis, and the inputs on which such a method should be based. These calculations show that a random directional method, in which the phasing, amplitude and direction of propagation of individual wave components are chosen randomly, has benefits in achieving the required ergodicity. In terms of analysis procedures, the extended maximum entropy principle, with inputs based upon vector quantities, produces the best description of directionality. With laboratory data describing the water surface elevation and the two horizontal velocity components at a single point, several steep sea states are considered. The results confirm that as the steepness of a sea state increases, the overall directionality of the sea state reduces. More importantly, it is also shown that the largest waves become less spread, or more uni- <b>directional,</b> than the <b>sea</b> state as a whole.

40|$|The <b>directional</b> {{spreading}} of <b>sea</b> {{states is}} an important design parameter in offshore engineering. Wave directionality affects the resulting wave kinematics, which affects the forces exerted on offshore structures. In this paper, we develop a method for estimating the amount of spreading, when the only information available is the time history of free surface elevation at a single point in space. We do this by predicting the second-order bound waves that occur at the difference in frequency of two freely propagating waves. The magnitude of these second-order bound waves {{is a function of}} the angle between the interacting waves. Thus, it is possible to infer some information about spreading from a single-point time history. We demonstrate that this approach works for wave groups in a fully nonlinear numerical wave tank. We create a synthetic random sea state and introduce noise into the analysis and thus show that our approach is robust and insensitive to noise, even with a signalto-noise ratio of unity in the difference waves. This approach is also applied to random waves in a physical wave tank where spreading was directly measured and also to a storm recorded in the North Sea. In all cases, we find our estimate of spreading is in good agreement with other measurements. © 2009 The Royal Society...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{triggers}} occurring {{during high}} background rate intervals have been reporter by Swift-BAT Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) detector. Among them, {{there were two}} on January 24, two on January 25, and two on February 13, and 18, all in 2008. These Swift-BAT triggers in most cases are probably noise triggers that occurred while Swift was entering the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). In fact, we show that they happen during a plentiful precipitation of high energy particles in the SAA, producing muons in the atmosphere detected by two <b>directional</b> telescopes at <b>sea</b> level, inside the SAA region (Tupi experiment). They look like sharp peaks in the muon counting rate. In the same category are two triggers from MILAGRO ground based detector, on January 25 and 31, 2008 respectively. In addition, the trigger coordinates are close to (and, in two cases, inside) {{the field of view}} of the telescopes. From an additional analysis in the behavior of the muon counting rate, it is possible to conclude that the events are produced by precipitation of high energy charged particles in the SAA region. Thus, due to its localization, the Tupi experiment constitutes a new sensor of high energy particle precipitation in the SAA, and it can be useful in the identification of some triggers of Gamma Ray Burst detectors.

40|$|Polarimetric {{remote sensing}} of {{structures}} in geophysical media is studied {{in this paper}} based on their symmetry properties. Orientations of spheroidal scatterers described by spherical, uniform, planophile, plagiothile, erectophile, and extremophile distributions are considered to derive their polarimetric backscattering characteristics. These distributions can be identified from the observed scattering coefficients by comparison with theoretical symmetry calculations. A new parameter is defined to study scattering structures in geophysical media. Experimental observations from polarimetric data acquired by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory airborne synthetic aperture radar over forests, sea ice, and sea surface are presented to illustrate the use of symmetry properties. For forests, the coniferous forest in Mount Shasta area and mixed forests neir Presque Isle show evidence of the centrical symmetry at C band. In sea ice from the Beaufort Sea, multiyear sea ice has a cross-polarized ratio e close to e(sub 0), calculated from symmetry, due to the randomness in the scattering structure. For first-year sea ice, e is much smaller than e(sub 0) {{as a result of}} preferential alignment of the columnar structure of the ice. From polarimetric data of a sea surface in the Bering sea, it is observed that e and e(sub 0) are increasing with incident angle and e is greater than e(sub 0) at L band because of the <b>directional</b> feature of <b>sea</b> surface waves. Use of symmetry properties of geophysical media for polarimetric radar calibration is also suggested...|$|R
40|$|A framework is {{developed}} {{to assess the}} <b>directional</b> changes in <b>sea</b> ice drift paths and associated deformation processes in response to atmospheric forcing. The framework is based on Lagrangian statistical analyses leveraging particle dispersion theory which tells us whether ice drift is in a subdiffusive, diffusive, ballistic, or superdiffusive dynamical regime using single-particle (absolute) dispersion statistics. In terms of sea ice deformation, the framework uses two- and three-particle dispersion to characterize along- and across-shear transport as well as differential kinematic parameters. The approach is tested with GPS beacons deployed in triplets on sea ice in the southern Beaufort Sea at varying distances from the coastline in fall of 2009 with eight individual events characterized. One transition in particular follows the sea level pressure (SLP) high on 8  October in 2009 while the sea ice drift was in a superdiffusive dynamic regime. In this case, the dispersion scaling exponent (which is a slope between single-particle absolute dispersion of sea ice drift and elapsed time) changed from superdiffusive (α [*]∼[*] 3) to ballistic (α [*]∼[*] 2) as the SLP was rounding its maximum pressure value. Following this shift between regimes, there was a loss in synchronicity between sea ice drift and atmospheric motion patterns. While this is only one case study, the outcomes suggest similar studies be conducted on more buoy arrays to test momentum transfer linkages between storms and sea ice responses as a function of dispersion regime states using scaling exponents. The tools and framework developed in this study provide a unique characterization technique to evaluate these states with respect to sea ice processes in general. Application of these techniques can aid ice hazard assessments and weather forecasting in support of marine transportation and indigenous use of near-shore Arctic areas...|$|R
40|$|The sea-level {{estimation}} of satellite altimetry {{is affected by}} a sea-state related error, the so called electromagnetic (EM) bias. The ocean-wave troughs reflect the radar signals stronger than the crests, which then biases the altimeter mean sea level measurements towards the troughs. ^ In order to establish an EM bias correction algorithm based on those parameters available from the satellite platform, namely the significant wave height and the normalized radar cross section (NRCS), the University of Massachusetts (UMass) collaborated with the Goddard Space Flight Center of NASA in four airborne experiments: EM Bias Experiment (1989), Shelf Edge Exchange Processes Experiment (SEEP 1989), Surface Wave Dynamics Experiment (SWADE 1991), and Southern Ocean Wave Experiment (SOWEX 1992). All four employed the 5. 3 and 13. 6 GHz frequencies currently {{being used by the}} TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite altimeters. The 5. 3 / 13. 6 GHz dual-frequency, nadir-looking scatterometer of UMass measured ocean surface NRCS by spatially resolving wave troughs and crests, while the Airborne Oceanographic Lidar and the 36 GHz Scanning Radar Altimeter of NASA profiled waves, and provided <b>directional</b> wave spectra. <b>Sea</b> state conditions were also derived from buoy recordings, primarily during the SWADE missions. ^ The first three experiments provided data for the prelaunch EM bias correction curves of the TOPEX/POSEIDON altimeters, while SOWEX complemented the earlier data set with high-wind, high-wave-height measurements. The evaluation of the TOPEX/POSEIDON performance has found that the prelaunch curves slightly overestimate the bias at both frequencies, meanwhile they predict the bias difference at the two frequencies correctly. On-orbit data analysis, as well as the observations from SOWEX suggest that both the 5. 3 and 13. 6 GHz biases decrease for high winds, which fact was taken into account during the revision of the EM bias correction algorithms. ...|$|R
40|$|Relationships among polarimetric {{backscattering}} coefficients {{are derived}} {{from the viewpoint of}} symmetry groups. For both reciprocal and non-reciprocal media, symmetry encountered in remote sensing due to reflection, rotation, azimuthal, and centrical symmetry groups is considered. The derived properties are general and valid to all scattering mechanisms, including volume and surface scatterings and their interactions, in a given symmetrical configuration. The scattering coefficients calculated from theoretical models for layer random media and rough surfaces are shown to obey the symmetry relations. Use of symmetry properties in remote sensing of structural and environmental responses of scattering media is also discussed. Orientations of spheroidal scatterers described by spherical, uniform, planophile, plagiothile, erectophile, and extremophile distributions are considered to derive their polarimetric backscattering characteristics. These distributions can be identified from the observed scattering coefficients by comparison with theoretical symmetry calculations. A new parameter is then defined to study scattering structures in geophysical media. Observations from polarimetric data acquired by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory airborne synthetic aperture radar over forests, sea ice, and sea surface are presented. Experimental evidences of the symmetry relationships are shown and their use in polarimetric remote sensing is illustrated. For forests, the coniferous forest in Mt. Shasta area (California) and mixed forest near Presque Isle (Maine) exhibit characteristics of the centrical symmetry at C-band.
