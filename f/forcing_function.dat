25|$|Newton {{and others}} before Pierre-Simon Laplace worked {{the problem from}} the {{perspective}} of a static system (equilibrium theory), that provided an approximation that described the tides that would occur in a non-inertial ocean evenly covering the whole Earth. The tide-generating force (or its corresponding potential) is still relevant to tidal theory, but as an intermediate quantity (<b>forcing</b> <b>function)</b> rather than as a final result; theory must also consider the Earth's accumulated dynamic tidal response to the applied forces, which response is influenced by ocean depth, the Earth's rotation, and other factors.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{calculating the}} FRF for a massndash&springndash&damper {{system with a}} mass of 1nbsp&kg, spring {{stiffness}} of 1.93nbsp&N/mm and a damping ratio of 0.1. The values of the spring and mass give a natural frequency of 7nbsp&Hz for this specific system. Applying the 1nbsp&Hz square wave from earlier allows the calculation of the predicted vibration of the mass. The figure illustrates the resulting vibration. It happens in this example that the fourth harmonic of the square wave falls at 7nbsp&Hz. The frequency response of the massndash&springndash&damper therefore outputs a high 7nbsp&Hz vibration even though the input force had a relatively low 7nbsp&Hz harmonic. This example highlights that the resulting vibration is dependent on both the <b>forcing</b> <b>function</b> and the system that the force is applied to.|$|E

40|$|The {{variation}} of interatomic forces with interatomic distances in crystals may be determined empirically from compressibility data. The experimentally possible range {{of variation in}} interatomic distance is, however, so small that {{the form of the}} <b>force</b> <b>function</b> valid for extrapolation to much greater distances cannot be adequately determined. From an analysis of Slater's compressibility data for the alkali halides it appears that for them the interionic forces of repulsion may be derived from a common <b>force</b> <b>function.</b> Because of the relatively large {{variation of}} lattice constant between the different alkali halides it is possible to determine a form for this common <b>force</b> <b>function</b> which is valid for relatively large variations in interatomic separation. The <b>force</b> <b>function</b> so found differs but little from the inverse power or from the exponential forms for small displacements from the equilibrium position. It drops off more rapidly, however, for increasing distances and increases more rapidly for decreasing distances. The solution given has the interesting property that of all possible <b>force</b> <b>functions</b> compatible with Slater's compressibility data it is the least favorable for the formation of a secondary structure...|$|R

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{interaction}} of an acoustical quasi-Gaussian beam centered on a rigid immovable sphere, during which at least three physical phenomena arise, namely, the (axial) acoustic scattering, the instantaneous force, and the time-average radiation force which are investigated here. The quasi-Gaussian beam is an exact solution of the source free Helmholtz wave equation and is characterized by an arbitrary waist w 0 and a diffraction convergence length known as the Rayleigh range z_R. Specialized formulations for the scattering and the instantaneous <b>force</b> <b>function</b> {{as well as the}} (time-averaged) radiation <b>force</b> <b>function</b> are provided. Numerical computations illustrate the variations of the backscattering form-function, the instantaneous <b>force</b> <b>function</b> and the (time-averaged) radiation <b>force</b> <b>function</b> versus the dimensionless frequency ka (where k is the wave number and a is the radius of the sphere), and the results show significant differences from the plane wave limit when the dimensionless beam waist parameter kw 0 < 25. The radiation <b>force</b> <b>function</b> may be used to calibrate high-frequency transducers operating with this type of beam. Furthermore, the theoretical analysis can be readily extended to the case of other types of spheres (i. e. elastic, viscoelastic, shells, coated spheres and shells) providing that their appropriate scattering coefficients are used...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this work, {{the theory}} for the {{acoustic}} radiation force on cylinders in a standing wave is {{extended to the}} case of cylinders coated with a viscoelastic polymer-type layer and immersed in ideal compressible fluids. Moreover, two different expressions for the radiation <b>force</b> <b>function</b> Yst (which is the radiation force per unit cross-sectional surface and unit energy density) for elastic cylinders are compared. The first expression for the radiation <b>force</b> <b>function</b> is obtained {{on the basis of the}} far-field derivation approach; however, the second expression is obtained from the near-field solution. It is demonstrated that the computational differences are commensurate with the same result. In the second step, calculations for the radiation <b>force</b> <b>function</b> are performed for an elastic brass cylinder coated by a viscoelastic (sound absorptive) phenolic polymer layer for four thicknesses of the outer covering layer. Additional calculations are also performed to investigate the fluid-loading effect on the radiation <b>force</b> <b>function</b> curves.
