5000|$|In {{previous}} Ethernet technology iterations, {{an alliance}} {{was formed to}} support the adoption of that new technology into the market. The Ethernet Alliance was preceded by the <b>Fast</b> <b>Ethernet</b> <b>Alliance,</b> the Gigabit Ethernet Alliance (GEA), the 10 Gigabit Ethernet Alliance (10 GEA), and the Ethernet in the First Mile Alliance (EFMA). These alliances would dissolve {{a few years after}} the completion of the standards effort they supported. Unfortunately, this was often long before the technology would reach volume adoption and there was seldom support for smaller Ethernet standards projects. Brad Booth noticed that upon the dissolution of the 10GEA that there was still a strong desire by the end users and media for information about 10 Gigabit Ethernet and some of the new technology being created for 10 Gigabit Ethernet, primarily 10GBASE-T. He worked with others in the industry and the standards bodies to create an alliance that would exist as long as Ethernet technology existed. The Ethernet Alliance was formed with the goal to support IEEE 802 Ethernet standards, but later expanded its scope to include all standards that rely upon or are dependent upon IEEE 802 Ethernet standards.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Fast</b> <b>Ethernet</b> is an {{extension}} of the 10-megabit Ethernet standard. It runs on UTP data or optical fiber cable in a star wired bus topology, similar to 10BASE-T where all cables are attached to a hub. <b>Fast</b> <b>Ethernet</b> devices are generally backward compatible with existing 10BASE-T systems, enabling plug-and-play upgrades from 10BASE-T. <b>Fast</b> <b>Ethernet</b> is sometimes referred to as 100BASE-X, where [...] "X" [...] is a placeholder for the FX and TX variants.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{evaluates the}} {{performance}} of three popular technologies used to interconnect machines on clusters: <b>Fast</b> <b>Ethernet,</b> Myrinet and Giganet. To achieve this purpose, we used the NAS Parallel Benchmarks. Surprisingly, for the LU application, {{the performance of}} <b>Fast</b> <b>Ethernet</b> was better than Myrinet. We also evaluate the performance gains provided by VIA, a user lever communication protocol, when compared with TCP/IP, a traditional, stackedbased communication protocol. The impacts caused {{by the use of}} Remote DMA Write are also evaluated. The results show that <b>Fast</b> <b>Ethernet,</b> when combined with a high performance communication protocol, such as VIA, has a good cost-benefit ratio, and can be a good choice to connect machines on a small cluster environment where bandwidth is not crucial for applications. ...|$|R
