30|$|The {{implication}} {{of these findings}} is {{that the use of}} the multiple choice format in language tests, often justified on the grounds of its reliability and practicality, may not actually represent a valid measurement of language ability at all, and that measurement accuracy is being sacrificed in the cause of economy and efficiency. In fact arguably the results of multiple choice tests are likely to represent distorted measurements owing more to the test takers’ ability to manipulate the testing medium than to <b>their</b> <b>language</b> <b>knowledge</b> and ability. Clearly this is an implication with far-reaching consequences in view of the noted tendency for test format to influence the content of teaching, and may go a long way towards explaining the noted lack of communicative English language skills acquired by Thai students during their formal education.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. During {{the course}} of science {{education}} one of the recognizable and desirable changes from a novice to an expert is in <b>their</b> <b>language</b> (<b>knowledge</b> representation). One noticeable change is that of weeding out ambiguous expressions bringing in clarity and rigor. However, this happens not by weeding out the concept names but by choosing more and more accurate linking words (relation names). By focusing on the relation names we report {{the results of a}} preliminary study that confirms that subject experts increasingly chose relation names (linking words) that come closer to formal descriptions. The significance of this observation to concept mapping community as well as to cognitive development is immense, for it provides a simple and effective method to study conceptual change, validates the use of refined concept maps in place of the traditional technique in science education, and also further strengthens the approach that relationship between nodes determine the semantics, and not the nodes per se. ...|$|R

The study contains a description of prewievs researchers’ perspective of the significance of communication and of the language of mathematics for students’ mathematical learning. The empirical data consist of qualitative methods in forms of interviews and observations. The results of this study show that all of the participating pedagogues believe that communication and the language of mathematics are important for students’ mathematical learning, but only three of them offered their students an opportunity to communicate in the teaching of mathematics. Only one of four pedagogues uses purely the language of mathematics, instead of a everyday mathematical language.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this multiple-case study was to {{understand}} the beliefs, classroom practices and experiences of four foreign language teachers using LinguaFolio, a self-assessment tool that allows learners to reflect on <b>their</b> <b>language</b> <b>knowledge</b> and cultural experiences. This study involved four Spanish teachers in four Midwestern towns. Data were collected using different methods including in-depth interviews, observations, field notes, and document analysis. ^ Consistent with multiple case studies, after analyzing each case separately, a cross case analysis was performed to contrast and compare the themes across the four cases. As a result, three interrelated themes emerged: a facilitator role; fostering self-regulated learners; and moving from teaching to learning. As facilitators, teachers played a more supportive role that implied modeling and scaffolding ways of learning, facilitating knowledge and creating an optimal environment for learning. All Participants agreed that LinguaFolio has helped learners become self-regulated learners, more creative, reflective, organized and accountable for their own learning. The four participants claimed that moving from a teacher-centered to a learner-centered approach allowed them to empower learners. Findings also revealed that although the four participants faced challenges with first-time LinguaFolio users, they agreed that after some time, students were able to demonstrate what they knew about the language and culture, reflect about their learning and self-assess <b>their</b> own <b>language</b> progress. ...|$|R
30|$|The VocabTrainerA 1 app—designed {{specifically}} for this study—aims {{to address this}} reality by going beyond conventional approaches {{to provide students with}} a hybrid, game-based learning tool, combining individual and collaborative learning tasks. Like the majority of available apps, VocabTrainerA 1 provides learners with valuable language input and the advantages of mobile learning (Burston 2013, 2015). What differentiates the app—hence students’ experiences and learning outcomes—is the synergy created by combining individual learning tasks with an engaging collaborative role-play, in which learners are challenged to negotiate in the target language and apply what they have learned to solve a murder mystery with their peers. By designing a hybrid game-based app that not only delivers randomly-generated multimedia exercises but also requires students to apply <b>their</b> <b>language</b> <b>knowledge</b> to meaningful communication tasks, the authors aimed to motivate learners and meet their needs for more language exposure and interaction with other speakers (Chapelle 1998). This approach is more in line with the current theories of foreign language learning which focus primarily on enabling students to communicate effectively in the target language (Sanders and Kenner 1983; Mitchell 1994; Spada 1997; Moeller and Catalano 2015).|$|R
