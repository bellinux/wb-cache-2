25|$|One {{key feature}} of a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>economy</b> {{would be that}} in mobile {{applications}} (primarily vehicular transport) energy generation and use could be decoupled. The primary energy source would need no longer travel with the vehicle, as it currently does with hydrocarbon fuels. Instead of tailpipes creating dispersed emissions, the energy (and pollution) could be generated from point sources such as large-scale, centralized facilities with improved efficiency. This would allow the possibility of technologies such as carbon sequestration, which are otherwise impossible for mobile applications. Alternatively, distributed energy generation schemes (such as small scale renewable energy sources) could be used, possibly associated with hydrogen stations.|$|E
25|$|Setting up a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>economy</b> {{would require}} huge {{investments}} in the infrastructure to store and distribute hydrogen to vehicles.

A study conducted by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory for the US Department of Energy in December 2006 found that the idle off-peak grid capacity in the US would be sufficient to power 84% of all vehicles in the US if they all were immediately replaced with electric vehicles.|$|E

40|$|This report details {{our recent}} {{progress}} in developing novel MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) based hydrogen gas sensors. These sensors couple novel thin films as the active {{layer on a}} device structure known as a Micro-HotPlate.

This Phase-I research effort was focused on achieving the following three objectives: (1) Investigation of sensor fabrication parameters and their effects on sensor performance. (2) Hydrogen response testing of these sensors in wet/dry and oxygen-containing/oxygen-deficient atmospheres. (3) Investigation of the long-term stability of these thin film materials and identification of limiting factors.

25|$|Much of the {{interest}} in the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>economy</b> concept {{is focused on the}} use of fuel cells to power electric cars. Current hydrogen fuel cells suffer from a low power-to-weight ratio. Fuel cells are much more efficient than internal combustion engines, and produce no harmful emissions. If a practical method of hydrogen storage is introduced, and fuel cells become cheaper, they can be economically viable to power hybrid fuel cell/battery vehicles, or purely fuel cell-driven ones. The economic viability of fuel cell powered vehicles will improve as the hydrocarbon fuels used in internal combustion engines become more expensive, because of the depletion of easily accessible reserves or economic accounting of environmental impact through such measures as carbon taxes.|$|E
25|$|Coal {{gasification}} {{can be used}} {{to produce}} syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2) gas. Often syngas is used to fire gas turbines to produce electricity, but the versatility of syngas also allows it to be converted into transportation fuels, such as gasoline and diesel, through the Fischer-Tropsch process; alternatively, syngas can be converted into methanol, which can be blended into fuel directly or converted to gasoline via the methanol to gasoline process. Gasification combined with Fischer-Tropsch technology is currently used by the Sasol chemical company of South Africa to make motor vehicle fuels from coal and natural gas. Alternatively, the hydrogen obtained from gasification can be used for various purposes, such as powering a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>economy,</b> making ammonia, or upgrading fossil fuels.|$|E

Several pivotal innovations, such as low platinum catalyst loading and thin film electrodes, drove the cost of fuel cells down, making development of PEMFC systems more realistic.

30|$|As {{the world}} is heading towards <b>hydrogen</b> energy <b>economy,</b> many {{attempts}} were reported for enhancing the hydrogen concentration in biomass-derived producer gas for the onward utilization in fuel cells and in hydrogen-fuelled vehicles.

Syngas (producer gas) can be made further rich in hydrogen by supplying more amount of steam to the AFB gasifier. However, the most common production method of steam utilizes fossil fuels which generate greenhouse gases and ozone-depleting gases, necessitating the optimization of steam utilization. Thus, the present study is significant as a ‘well-to-tank’ LCA approach to make comparison between two solid fuel-hydrogen-rich gaseous fuel life cycles, that is, the life cycles of fossil fuel-derived coal gas and its potential renewable alternative (coconut shell-derived syngas) are compared with respect to India, the world's largest low-ash-content coconut shell producer.|$|R
40|$|With no {{indigenous}} fossil fuels, over 90 % of Hawaii's {{energy is}} derived from imported crude oil and finished petroleum products.
