5|$|The Veerashaiva {{writers were}} <b>devotees</b> <b>of</b> the Hindu god Shiva, his 25 forms, and the expositions of Shaivism. An {{important}} development in their literature {{during this period}} was the recasting the saints of the 12th century Veerashaiva movement (Basavanna, Allama Prabhu and others) as the protagonists of their writings.|$|E
5|$|The author {{starts with}} Basavanna's birth and weaves episodes of other famous sharanas (<b>devotees</b> <b>of</b> Hindu god Shiva)—such as Allama Prabhu—into his life history. Basavanna is {{depicted}} as a saintly person, a great devotee of Shiva, an incarnation of Nandi, a man of miracles and one with a mission, sent to re-establish the Veerashaiva faith on earth. The work is arranged into eight aswasas (divisions) containing sixty-one sandhis (chapters) and 3,621 verses. The narration includes stories of <b>devotees</b> <b>of</b> Shiva who overcame their egos. Apart from a few variations, the writings of Bhima Kavi and his predecessors are complementary. Two lost works of Bhima Kavi are the Bhimakaviswara Ragale and the Bhringidandaka.|$|E
5|$|During the hot Washington summers, the Harrisons {{took refuge}} in Deer Park, Maryland and Cape May Point, New Jersey. In 1890, John Wanamaker joined with other Philadelphia <b>devotees</b> <b>of</b> the Harrisons and made a gift to them of a summer cottage at Cape May. Harrison, though appreciative, was uncomfortable with the {{appearance}} of impropriety; a month later, he paid Wanamaker $10,000 as reimbursement to the donors. Nevertheless, Harrison's opponents made the gift the subject of national ridicule, and Mrs. Harrison and the president were vigorously criticized.|$|E

5|$|Kalki Koechlin {{was born}} in Pondicherry, India, on 10 January 1984 to French parents, Joel Koechlin and Françoise Armandie, who came to India from Angers, France. She is a {{descendant}} of Maurice Koechlin, a French structural engineer who {{played an important role}} in the design and construction of the Eiffel Tower. Koechlin's parents are <b>devotees</b> <b>of</b> Sri Aurobindo. The family later settled in Kallatty, a village near Ooty in Tamil Nadu, where Koechlin's father established a business designing hang-gliders and ultralight aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Mahavira {{grew up as}} a prince. According to {{the second}} chapter of the Śvētāmbara text Acharanga Sutra, both of his parents were {{followers}} and lay <b>devotees</b> <b>of</b> Parshvanatha. Jain traditions do not agree on whether Mahavira ever married. According to the Digambara tradition, Mahavira's parents wanted him to marry Yashoda but Mahavira refused to marry. According to the Śvētāmbara tradition, {{he was married to}} Yashoda at a young age and had one daughter, Priyadarshana, also called Anojja.|$|E
5|$|The Buddhist Pali canon and the Ghata-Jâtaka (No.454) polemically {{mention the}} <b>devotees</b> <b>of</b> Vâsudeva and Baladeva. These texts have many peculiarities {{and may be}} a garbled and {{confused}} version of the Krishna legends. The texts of Jainism mention these tales as well, also with many peculiarities and different versions, in their legends about Tirthankaras. This inclusion of Krishna-related legends in ancient Buddhist and Jaina literature suggests that Krishna theology was existent and important in the religious landscape observed by non-Hindu traditions of ancient India.|$|E

50|$|Chintamani {{was based}} on the legendary story of a Sanskrit poet named Bilwamangal. He was <b>devotee</b> <b>of</b> Lord Krishna a {{resident}} of Varanasi. He gets infatuated towards a courtesan called Chintamani, a woman of ill-fame and deserts his wife. However, Chintamani is an ardent <b>devotee</b> <b>of</b> Lord Krishna and spends most of her time singing bhajans in praise of Lord Krishna. His attraction towards Chintamani eventually draws Bilwamangal closer towards Lord Krishna and transforms his life forever. Bilwangal, himself, becomes a <b>devotee</b> <b>of</b> Lord Krishna and pens a monumental Sanskrit work, Sri Krishna Karnamritam.|$|R
5|$|The temple {{complex is}} a {{collection}} of five temples, including a Buddhist temple. The central temple dedicated to Shiva (Siva) is the most prestigious and biggest, and is popular amongst Hindus. The other temples are dedicated to Ganesha, Ayyanayake and Kali. The Kali temple is also popular with Buddhists, who frequent the complex. Post-19th century, most of the <b>devotees</b> <b>of</b> all temples in the complex belong to the majority Sinhala Buddhist ethnic group; the temples, excluding the Ayyanayake and the Buddhist temple, are administered by families belonging to the minority Hindu Tamils.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{the term}} bhakti, meaning devotion, is not {{confined}} to any one deity. However, Krishna is an important and popular focus of the devotionalism tradition within Hinduism, particularly among the Vaishnava sects. <b>Devotees</b> <b>of</b> Krishna subscribe to the concept of lila, meaning 'divine play', as the central principle of the universe. It is a form of bhakti yoga, one of three types of yoga discussed by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E
5|$|Before the 12th century, Jain writers had {{dominated}} Kannada literature {{with their}} champu (verses mixed with prose) style of writings popular in court literature. In the later medieval period, {{they had to}} contend with the Veerashaivas who challenged the very notion of royal literature with their vachana poetry, a stylised form of spoken language, more popular in folk genres. The popular growth of Veerashaiva (<b>devotees</b> <b>of</b> the Hindu god Shiva) literature began in the 12th century, while Vaishnava (<b>devotees</b> <b>of</b> the Hindu god Vishnu) writers began to exert their influence from the 15th century. Jain writers had to reinvent their art, moving away from the traditional themes of renunciation and tenets to focus on contemporary topics. Andayya's 13th century classic Kabbigara Kava ("Poets defender") was an early example of the change in literary style, and also reflected the hostility toward the Veerashaivas; the Jain author found it ideal to narrate the story of Manmatha, the God of Love, who turned Shiva into a half woman. The Veerashaivas had initiated an important change, casting aside the concept of formal literature and making way for shorter local genres. The Vaishnava haridasas later popularised musical forms that were more acceptable to the common man. Written classics eulogising kings and commanders were a thing of the past. Kannada literature had moved closer to the spoken and sung folk traditions, with singability being its hallmark, and devotion to God its goal.|$|E

5|$|Eng Foong Ho v. Attorney-General is {{the name}} of two cases of the Singapore courts, a High Court {{decision}} delivered in 2008 and the 2009 judgment by the Court of Appeal. The main issue raised by the case was whether the Collector of Land Revenue had treated the plaintiffs (later appellants), who were <b>devotees</b> <b>of</b> the Jin Long Si Temple, unequally by compulsorily acquiring for public purposes the land on which the temple stood but not the lands of a Hindu mission and a Christian church nearby. It was alleged that the authorities had acted in violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, which guarantees the rights to equality before the law and equal protection of the law.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí's {{collaboration}} with Martorell was a determining factor in Gaudí's recommendation for the Sagrada Família. The church {{was the idea}} of Josep Maria Bocabella, founder of the <b>Devotees</b> <b>of</b> Saint Joseph Association, which acquired a complete block of Barcelona's Eixample district. The project was originally entrusted to Francisco de Paula del Villar y Lozano, who planned the construction of a neo-Gothic church, on which work began in 1882. However, the following year Villar resigned due to disagreements with the construction board, and the task went to Gaudí, who completely redesigned the project, apart from the part of the crypt that had already been built. Gaudí devoted {{the rest of his life}} to the construction of the church, which was to be the synthesis of all of his architectural discoveries.|$|E
5|$|Important {{contributions}} {{were made}} by some prominent literary families. One Jain family produced several authors, including Mallikarjuna, the noted anthologist (1245); his brother-in-law Janna (1209), the court poet of King Veera Ballala II; Mallikarjuna's son Keshiraja (1260), considered by D. R. Nagaraj, a scholar on literary cultures in history, {{to be the greatest}} theorist of Kannada grammar; and Sumanobana, who was in the court of King Narasimha I and was the maternal grandfather of Keshiraja. Harihara (1160) and his nephew Raghavanka (1200), poets who set the trend for using native metres, came from a Shaiva family (<b>devotees</b> <b>of</b> the god Shiva).|$|E

5|$|In Hindu mythology, Parvati, wife of Shiva, once {{closed the}} eyes of her husband playfully in a flower garden at their abode atop Mount Kailash. Although only a moment for the gods, all light {{was taken from the}} universe, and the earth, in turn, was {{submerged}} in darkness for years. Parvati performed penance along with other <b>devotees</b> <b>of</b> Shiva. Then her husband appeared as a column of fire at the top of Annamalai hills, returning light to the world. He then merged with Parvati to form Ardhanarishvara, the half-female, half-male form of Shiva. The Annamalai, or red mountain, lies behind the Annamalaiyar temple, and is associated with the temple of its namesake. The hill is sacred and considered a lingam, or iconic representation of Shiva, in itself.|$|E
5|$|Nagore dargah is {{a common}} place of worship for <b>devotees</b> <b>of</b> various {{religious}} faiths. According to {{the administration of the}} dargah, about 50–75 per cent of pilgrims visiting the dargah everyday are Hindus. The practise of offering flowers, sweetmeats and food, the way of conducting worship, and playing musical instruments like nadaswaram (a type of pipe instrument commonly used in Tamil Nadu) are atypical of Hindu tradition. Other worship practises include offering flags and lighting lamps of ghee at the saint's tomb. Devotees shave their heads near the tank and offer tin or silver-plated facsimiles of body parts, houses, sailboats matching their material needs.|$|E
5|$|Per {{traditional}} accounts, some Brahmins of Varanasi {{were still}} not satisfied, and sent two thieves {{to steal the}} manuscript. The thieves tried {{to break into the}} Ashram of Tulsidas, but were confronted by two guards with bows and arrows, of dark and fair complexion. The thieves {{had a change of heart}} and came to Tulsidas in the morning to ask who the two guards were. Believing that the two guards could be none other than Rama and Lakshmana, Tulsidas was aggrieved to know that they were guarding his home at night. He sent the manuscript of Ramcahritmanas to his friend Rai Todar Mal, the finance minister of Akbar, and donated all his money. The thieves were reformed and became <b>devotees</b> <b>of</b> Rama.|$|E
