40|$|A novel {{series of}} piperidine-substituted {{triazine}} derivatives have been synthesized and evaluated for anti-HIV activities in MT- 4 cells. Most compounds displayed extremely promising activity against wild-type HIV- 1 with EC(50) values in low nanomolar concentration, {{better than that}} of Nevirapine, Delavirdine, Zidovudine and <b>Dideoxycitidine,</b> and higher potency towards the resistant mutant strain K 103 N/Y 181 C than that of Nevirapine and Delavirdine. Selected compounds were also assayed against reverse transcriptase with lower IC(50) values than that of Nevirapine. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) of these novel structural congeners was also discussed. status: publishe...|$|E
