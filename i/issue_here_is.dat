25|$|It {{is not a}} {{showdown}} at high noon between creation and evolution. It is not religion versus science. We {{are not trying to}} sneak the Bible into the classroom, or any other religious doctrine. The real <b>issue</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that of religious freedom under the United States Constitution.|$|E
25|$|The Executive Committee of the ETS held formal {{hearings}} with Sanders and Pinnock {{and decided}} {{that they had no}} problems with Pinnock but said that they could not approve of Sanders’ belief in “probabilistic prophecy”, which claims that some biblical predictions about future events are not guaranteed since they are conditional upon what beings with free will decide to do. At <b>issue</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> the truth value of statements about the future actions of free creatures. At the 2003 annual ETS meeting the membership voted overwhelmingly to affirm Pinnock’s inclusion but fell 25 votes short of the 2/3 majority necessary to expel Sanders.|$|E

40|$|Transmedia {{storytelling}} and transmedia activism both afford and demand {{new approaches to}} telling our stories. Contemporary transmedia utilises multiple tools to engage audiences by creating stories that offer unique approaches to narrative, character, setting and innovative {{ways of looking at}} social <b>issues.</b> <b>Here</b> <b>are</b> 5 of the best recent examples...|$|R
25|$|Unger turns this {{question}} {{from one of}} general principles {{to one of the}} enactment of a vision or project of self-affirmation. For Unger, at <b>issue</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> not the pure speculation of philosophical inquiry into the nature of human beings and their activities, but rather a transformative project of self and society. In this way, the task is to realize a vision and enact a program of self-affirmation. The only alternative is to find a better one or fail at self-affirmation. The standards by which Unger confirms a project of self-affirmation are as follows: socially it is unstable if it fails to deal with behavior predispositions or material constraints, and existentially it fails if it disregards recurrent features of our experience, e.g. dependence upon others.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, the Chicago/Gary Airport Compact {{was signed}} by the cities of Chicago and Gary, Indiana, {{creating}} a new administration for the Gary/Chicago International Airport just across the state line. While markedly smaller than the proposed Peotone site, this airport already has more land and a longer main runway than Midway Airport. Gary is also many miles closer than Peotone to downtown Chicago. In addition public transportation is already in place to the Loop via the South Shore Line. Indiana and the FAA have provided significant funding for a Gary runway expansion, currently under construction. The <b>issue</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> {{a large portion of}} the revenue that is generated would go to the state of Indiana as opposed to Chicago and the state of Illinois, the very entities the airport would mainly serve.|$|E
500|$|An <b>issue</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> the {{ambiguity}} of the word congressus ("met"). It often refers to meeting in a conventional combat but can have reference to other types of meetings too. A similar ambiguity appears in Seneca [...] and in [...] Ausonius' 19th epitaph, narrated by Troilus himself. The dead prince tells how he has been dragged by his horses after falling in unequal battle with Achilles. A reference in the epitaph comparing Troilus' death to Hector's suggests that Troilus dies later than in the traditional narrative, something that, according to Boitani, also happens in Virgil.|$|E
50|$|Finally, {{the court}} {{distinguished}} United States v. Miller which involved business records voluntarily {{given to a}} bank. Where Miller involved simple business records, the emails at <b>issue</b> <b>here</b> <b>are</b> personal and confidential and concern {{a wide variety of}} topics. Where the information in Miller was used in the ordinary course of business of the bank, the ISP <b>here</b> <b>was</b> an intermediary, not the intended recipient.|$|R

500|$|When {{the open}} housing {{proposal}} became public, local reaction was often hostile. [...] Such {{was the reaction}} of many residents in Warren, Michigan, a predominately white blue-collar suburb of Detroit. While it had no formal discriminatory laws, most blacks were excluded by zoning practices, refusals to sell to them, and intimidatory actions of white property owners, {{many of whom were}} ethnic Polish and Catholic and had moved to the suburb as part of white flight. By this time, Detroit was 40–50 percent black. [...] HUD made Warren a prime target for Open Communities enforcement and threatened to halt all federal assistance to the town unless it took a series of actions to end racial discrimination there; town officials said progress was being made and that their citizens resented forced integration. [...] Romney rejected this response, partly because when he was governor, Warren residents had thrown rocks and garbage and yelled obscenities for days at a biracial couple who moved into town. [...] Now the secretary said, [...] "The youth of this nation, the minorities of this nation, the discriminated of this nation are not going to wait for 'nature to take its course.'

2500|$|Sprecher {{dismissed}} the village's {{argument that the}} marketing of the items met the test laid out by the Supreme Court in Leary v. United States, {{that there be a}} rational connection between the fact proved and the fact presumed. They had missed the point of that case, where the Court had struck down Timothy Leary's conviction for smuggling marijuana because it could not be rationally presumed, as the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 did, that someone possessing the drug knew it came from outside the United States. [...] "he <b>issue</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> whether the 'fact proved,' (marketing scheme), is too vague a standard to give rise to the 'fact presumed,' (drug-relatedness)," [...] he said.|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, {{he faced}} a {{challenger}} in the primary, attorney Greg Delev of Anderson Township. Brinkman told the Enquirer, [...] "I ran for office when the party wanted to dictate who my state representative {{was going to}} be. I couldn't stand for that, so I ran, and I'm proud I did. It's been a frustrating three years as I've watched Governor Taft drive the state off a cliff. But I've been fighting back." [...] Delev said he agreed with Brinkman {{on most of the}} issues, but that Brinkman's actions in Columbus had made the district [...] "the laughingstock of the state." [...] The Cincinnati Enquirer said both candidates were [...] "rock-ribbed conservatives who agree on most fiscal and social issues," [...] but endorsed Delev. [...] "The <b>issue</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> Brinkman's lack of effectiveness," [...] said the newspaper, echoing the Columbus Monthly article: ...|$|E
2500|$|The <b>issue</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> whether physicians' written {{reports of}} medical {{examinations}} {{they have made}} of a disability claimant may constitute [...] "substantial evidence" [...] supportive of a finding of nondisability, within the 205 (g) standard, when the claimant objects to the admissibility of those reports and when the only live testimony is presented by his side and {{is contrary to the}} reports. [...] Perales injured his back and subsequently had lumbar spinal surgery. [...] He was deemed to have had a successful result by his physician and others who reviewed his case. [...] Perales contended the surgery had been unsuccessful, in that he was unable to return to work. [...] He presented an opinion from a physician confirming the belief that he was unemployable. [...] Despite this, the administrative hearing found that he was not eligible for Social Security Disability. [...] Perales did not subpoena the doctors who had written unfavorable reports and cross examine them {{in the course of his}} hearing, despite having the opportunity to do so. [...] Later, he claimed this failure, on his part had denied him of a fair hearing, and hence claimed a violation of his constitutional right to due process.|$|E
