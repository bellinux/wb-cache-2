Starting with only the Verilog source code, all required makefiles, synthesis scripts, and constraint files are automatically derived. An overconstraining leaf module time-budgeting method is used for initial synthesis. For subsequent synthesis runs, a top-level constraint file (perhaps manually generated) is used to automatically create constraints for leaf modules.

40|$|Memory latency {{tolerant}} architectures support {{thousands of}} in-flight instructions without scaling cyclecritical processor resources, {{and thousands of}} useful instructions can complete in parallel with a miss to memory. These architectures however require large queues to track all loads and stores executed while a miss is pending. <b>Hierarchical</b> <b>designs</b> alleviate cycle time impact of these structures but the CAM and search functions required to enforce memory ordering and provide data forwarding place high demand on area and power. We present new load-store processing algorithms for latency tolerant architectures. We augment primary load and store queues with secondary buffers. The secondary load buffer is a set associative structure, similar to a cache. The secondary store buffer, the Store Redo Log, is a first-in first-out structure recording the program order of all stores completed in parallel with a miss, and has no CAM and search functions. Instead of the secondary store queue, a cache provides temporary forwarding. The SRL enforces memory ordering by ensuring memory updates occur in program order once the miss returns. The new algorithms eliminate the CAM and search functions in the secondary load and store buffers, and remove fundamental sources of complexity, power, and area inefficiency in load/store processing. The new organization, while being area and power efficient, is competitive in performance compared to <b>hierarchical</b> <b>designs.</b> 1...|$|R
