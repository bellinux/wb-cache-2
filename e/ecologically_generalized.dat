40|$|The macro-habitat {{preferences}} of three conspicuous and widely distributed species of lizards (Aspidoscelis tigris, Callisaurus draconoides, and Uta stansburiana) were examined across four geomorphic landforms (sandy wash, rocky wash, alluvial plain, and alluvial deposit) {{in the southern}} Mojave Desert, California. All three species were non-randomly distributed across the four geomorphic landforms. The goal {{of this study was}} to develop less <b>ecologically</b> <b>generalized</b> habitat models (LizLand) than the vegetation-based wildlife–habitat relationship models in the California Gap Analysis Program (CA-GAP). Conceptually, LizLand is a geomorphological approach to habitat modeling in arid environments. Specifically, LizLand is a series of spatially explicit habitat models that define and predict habitat for A. tigris, C. draconoides, and U. stansburiana in Joshua Tree National Park and the Marine Air Ground Task Force Training Command, Marine Corp Air Ground Combat Center. LizLand models resulted in higher resolution habitat models with minimal reduction in model accuracy. These models more accurately captured the complexity of the Mojave Desert ecosystem and offered greater ecological resolution in identifying habitat in contrast to the CA-GAP models...|$|E
40|$|Multilocus phylogeography can uncover taxonomically unrecognized lineage {{diversity}} across complex biomes. The Australian monsoonal tropics include vast, ecologically intact savanna-woodland plains {{interspersed with}} ancient sandstone uplands. Although recognized in general for its high species richness and endemism, the biodiversity {{of the region}} remains underexplored due to its remoteness. This is despite {{a high rate of}} ongoing species discovery, especially in wetter regions and for rock-restricted taxa. To provide a baseline for ongoing comparative analyses, we tested for phylogeographic structure in an <b>ecologically</b> <b>generalized</b> and widespread taxon, the gecko Heteronotia binoei. We apply coalescent analyses to multilocus sequence data (mitochondrial DNA and eight nuclear DNA introns) from individuals sampled extensively and at fine scale across the region. The results demonstrate surprisingly deep and geographically nested lineage diversity. Several intra-specific clades previously shown to be endemic to the region were themselves found to contain multiple, short-range lineages. To infer landscapes with concentrations of unique phylogeographic diversity, we probabilistically estimate the ranges of lineages from point data and then, combining these estimates with the nDNA species tree, estimate phyloendemism across the region. Highest levels of phyloendemism occur in northern Top End, especially on islands, across the topographically complex Arnhem escarpment, and across the sandstone ranges of the western Gulf region. These results drive home that deep phylogeographic structure is prevalent in tropical low-dispersal taxa, even ones that are ubiquitous across geography and habitats. C. Moritz, M. K. Fujita, D.

40|$|Four {{species were}} {{selected}} within the littoral of Tshegera Island, and include H. astatodon, H. olivaceus, H. crebridens and H. paucidens. These species, identified on {{basis of the}} SMRS, express their individuality most strongly with respect to dentition, breeding colours, normal habitat and preferred breeding territory. All four species are maternal mouthbrooders. This reproductive strategy is characterized by complete division of labour and polygamy. Breeding males compete for optimal territories and ready to spawn females. They are characterized by fast growth, large size and overall low condition factor. Females invest in few but large yolked ova and go through a fasting period while incubating the eggs. Females are generally characterized by slower growth, smaller size and higher condition factor when compared to males. In females the energy turnover during gonadal development and subsequent mouthbrooding is high, but the energy expenditure low. Mean fecundity varies between 25 and 36 eggs per brood and mean egg size between 2. 6 and 2. 7 mm. The right ovary, although small, is functional. Breeding of variable intensity goes on throughout the year. The main dry season corresponds to synchronized breeding. During the other {{months of the year}} species breed asynchronously. Both types of breeding are related to food availability for adults and offspring. The major breeding peak which starts in July coincides to improved body condition in both sexes. In similarity with the East African flocks, the Lake Kivu haplochromines display subdivision within the major trophic groups and invasion of the major lacustrine habitats. They are nevertheless morphologically and <b>ecologically</b> <b>generalized.</b> They tend to be plesiomorphic with low diversification within each trophic group, have a lake wide distribution (eurytopic) and incline to be altricial within their specialized reproductive guild. The evolutionary status of the Lake Kivu haplochromines may be explained by survival of members of an ancestral fauna in an isolated bay during the Recent volcanic events which destroyed life in the Main Basin. The Lake Kivu flock, therefore, is a relict and is believed not to have evolved {{within the confines of the}} present-day lake. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{attempting}} to characterize a community, {{it is necessary}} to measure ecological attributes to quantitatively describe the unique aspects of that community and to make comparisons. This thesis reports on a long-term investigation of the community ecology of a turtle assemblage in the Tennessee River Gorge relative to the following hypotheses: 1) <b>ecologically</b> <b>generalized</b> species will be the most numerically abundant forms present in the TRG, 2) adult sex ratios of turtle populations in the TRG will be biased in favor of males, and 3) mean adult body size measurements and size dimorphism index (SDI) values of turtle populations in the TRG will be consistent with those reported from other populations. To examine these hypotheses, a balanced trapping regime was carried out during May through August, from 2000 to 2006, in the Tennessee River Gorge. Trapping methods included baited traps (hoop nets and fyke nets) and unbaited traps (fyke nets, basking traps, hand capture, and trammel nets). The relative abundance of generalist turtle species was consistently greater than that of more sensitive species during each study year and for the entire study period. Habitat specialist were detected in relatively low numbers and were absent during some years of the study. Accordingly, species diversity and evenness measurements were low and reflected the numerical dominance of a few species. Adult sex ratios for all turtle species in the TRG were biased in favor of males, indicating differential survival rates for adult female turtles. Multiple limiting factors may be responsible for this finding as the ecology of each species is unique. Observed adult body measurements for TRG turtle populations were generally larger than those reported from other studies within their respective ranges. One species in particular, Sternotherus odoratus, was observed to display a carapace length that was significantly greater than those reported from southern or northern climes. This finding appears contrary to the theory that body sizes for turtles increase with latitude, or Bergmann 2 ̆ 7 s rule. The SDI values from the TRG turtles were not as substantial as those reported from other localities, primarily due to the relatively greater body sizes achieved by male turtles in the TRG. Generally, larger body sizes and observed dimorphism index values for some species could be the end result of individual processes acting simultaneously, such as: 1) variable maturation rates for the sexes, 2) genetic variability, and 3) a productive ecosystem...|$|E
