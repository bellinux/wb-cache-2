5|$|There are {{different}} {{opinions on the}} significance of these principles. Some note that the osteopathic medical philosophy <b>is</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> the tenets of holistic medicine, suggestive of a kind of social movement within the field of medicine, one that promotes a more patient-centered, holistic approach to medicine, and emphasizes the role of the primary care physician within the health care system. Others point out that {{there is nothing in the}} principles that would distinguish D.O. from M.D. training in any fundamental way. One study, published in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association found a majority of M.D. medical school administrators and faculty saw nothing objectionable in the core principles listed above, and some endorse them generally as broad medical principles.|$|E
5|$|Eugenides {{and several}} critics {{compared}} Cal's condition to mythical creatures {{described by the}} ancient Greeks. The author alluded his protagonist's nature and heritage to the Minotaur, the half-man and half-bull creature. Cal's father is conceived after his grandparents' attendance of a theatric play entitled The Minotaur. The puzzle of Cal's genetic identity <b>is</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> the creature's labyrinth, and the thread that leads out of the maze is held here by his paternal grandmother, a former silk farmer. Frances Bartkowski, a scholar of English, named Callie in her puberty as a chimera. The mythical monster is an analogy for a complex personality, a mixture of body parts from various animals that each represents a human aspect or characteristic. Similarly, adolescent Callie is an amalgamation of her genes, neither male nor female, neither adult nor child, and yet all {{of them at the}} same time.|$|E
5000|$|The {{premise of}} the film was {{partially}} inspired by Neil Simon's The Sunshine Boys, where Harrison Ford's role <b>was</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> Clark while Diane Keaton's role <b>was</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> Lewis and Rachel McAdams' role <b>was</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> Clark's nephew Ben. Screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna and producer J. J. Abrams [...] "dreamed of having Harrison Ford in the film" [...] {{from the point of}} early script development. Shortly after Abrams cast Harrison Ford as Mike Pomeroy, Roger Michell took over as director.|$|R

5|$|Mr. Burns falls {{ill with}} hypohemia (a fictional {{condition}} in which the body naturally runs out of blood, though it <b>is</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> a real condition called hypovolemia) and needs a blood transfusion. His blood type, double O negative, is very rare, however, {{and none of the}} employees at Springfield Nuclear Power Plant have it. Homer discovers that Bart has double O negative blood and urges his son to donate, promising that he will be handsomely rewarded. Bart reluctantly agrees and his blood donation saves Mr. Burns' life. Mr. Burns is rejuvenated by the blood and he sends the Simpson family a thank you card. Enraged at Mr. Burns' paltry gesture, Homer writes an insulting reply, but Marge convinces him at the last minute not to send it. The next morning, Homer discovers that the letter is gone as Bart has mailed it.|$|E
5|$|While {{the entire}} script {{was still in}} the draft phase, Maeda revised lines that felt unnatural after asking others for their {{opinions}} on it, including Na-Ga. When writing the script, Maeda made a conscious effort to write Charlotte in the framework of an anime series, as opposed to when he wrote the script for Angel Beats!, which he admits he wrote more akin to the framework of a video game. In this way, Toba felt that Charlotte was Maeda's effort to write a story in its purest form that could not be made into a video game, unlike Angel Beats!. Toba also noted that the characters in Charlotte are not written for a video game scenario, especially the protagonist, and went on to echo Horikawa's sentiment that Charlotte <b>is</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> an I novel for Maeda. Toba explained that this is a result of Maeda's effort to remove the restrictions that come from writing the scenario for a video game.|$|E
5|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} suggests that self-control <b>is</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> a muscle that can be strengthened through practice. In other words, self-control abilities are malleable, a fact that can be a source of hope for those who struggle with this skill. In psychotherapy, treatment for impulse-control issues often involves teaching individuals to realize the downsides of acting on immediate urges and in turn to practice delaying gratification. In anxiety disorders, this process occurs through exposure to a feared situation – which is very uncomfortable at first, but eventually becomes tolerable and even trains a person's mind and body that these situations are less threatening than originally feared. Exposure therapy is only effective if an individual can delay gratification and resist the urge to escape the situation early on. To shed insight on the tradeoff between short- and long-term gains, therapists might also help individuals construct a pro-con list of a certain behavior, with sections for short-term and long-term outcomes. For maladaptive coping behaviors such as self-injury, substance use or avoidance, there are generally no long-term pros. Meanwhile, abstinence from acting on a harmful urge (i.e., delayed gratification) generally results in long-term benefits. This realization can be a powerful impetus for change.|$|E

50|$|Particle {{systems can}} be either {{animated}} or static; that is, the lifetime of each particle can either be distributed over time or rendered all at once. The consequence of this distinction {{is similar to the}} difference between snowflakes and hair - animated particles <b>are</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> snowflakes, which move around as distinct points in space, and static particles <b>are</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> hair, which consists of a distinct number of curves.|$|R

25|$|Dennett {{claims that}} {{conventional}} {{explanations of the}} colour change boil down to either Orwellian or Stalinesque hypotheses, which he says {{are the result of}} Descartes' continued influence on our vision of the mind. In an Orwellian hypothesis, the subject comes to one conclusion, then goes back and changes that memory in light of subsequent events. This <b>is</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, where records of the past are routinely altered. In a Stalinesque hypothesis, the two events would be reconciled prior to entering the subject's consciousness, with the final result presented as fully resolved. This <b>is</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> Joseph Stalin's show trials, where the verdict has been decided in advance and the trial is just a rote presentation.|$|E
25|$|The bishōnen is {{typically}} slender, with clear skin, stylish hair, and distinctly feminine facial features (such as high cheekbones), but simultaneously retains a male body.

Shakya has criticized this industry as the publication of Buddhist books uproots small forests and consequently kills thousands of insects.|$|E
25|$|One coin highly sought-after by {{collectors}} is the 1930 penny. Its rarity is so {{well known}} amongst Australians, that demand for what <b>is</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> a blue-chip investment has pushed prices to approximately A$26,000 for an average standard example. A proof example {{of the same coin}} recently changed hands for over A$620,000, making it the most expensive copper coin in the world.|$|E
25|$|Pentacene, as well {{as other}} organic conductors, is subject to rapid {{oxidation}} in air, which precludes commercialization. If the pentacene is preoxidized, the pentacene-quinone is a potential gate insulator, then the mobility can approach that of rubrene – the highest-mobility organic semiconductor – namely, 40cm2/(V·s). This pentacene oxidation technique <b>is</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> the silicon oxidation used in the silicon electronics.|$|E
