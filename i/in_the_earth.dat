5|$|Similar to xenon, neon content {{observed}} in samples of volcanic gases is enriched in 20Ne, {{as well as}} nucleogenic 21Ne, relative to 22Ne content. The neon isotopic content of these mantle-derived samples represents a non-atmospheric source of neon. The 20Ne-enriched components are attributed to exotic primordial rare gas components <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth,</b> possibly representing solar neon. Elevated 20Ne abundances are found in diamonds, further suggesting a solar neon reservoir <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth.</b>|$|E

5|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} heat energy {{generated}} and stored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth.</b> Thermal energy is {{the energy that}} determines the temperature of matter. The geothermal energy of the Earth's crust originates from the original formation of the planet and from radioactive decay of materials (in currently uncertain but possibly roughly equal proportions). The geothermal gradient, which is the difference in temperature between {{the core of the}} planet and its surface, drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface. The adjective geothermal originates from the Greek roots γη (ge), meaning earth, and θερμος (thermos), meaning hot.|$|E

5|$|It was {{announced}} in November 2016 that pink granite, usually found deep in the Earth's crust, {{had been found in}} drilling samples. It suggests the impact was so great it shocked and melted rocks found deep in the crust, causing them to shoot up before falling back down to produce the peak rings. The granite samples were also found to be lighter and weaker than normal granite, a result of the shock and extreme conditions of the impact. The findings confirmed that the rock comprising the peak ring had originated deep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth,</b> and was ejected to the surface. It had been subjected to immense pressures and forces and had been melted by heat and shocked by pressure from its usual state into its present form in just minutes; the fact that the peak ring was made of granite was also significant, since granite is not a rock found in sea-floor deposits, originating much deeper <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth,</b> and had been ejected to the surface by the immense pressures of impact. Gypsum, a sulfate-containing rock that is usually present in the shallow seabed of the region, had been almost entirely removed and likely vaporized to enter the atmosphere, an event immediately followed by a megatsunami sufficient to lay down the largest known layered bed of sand, around 100 m deep and separated by grain size, directly above the peak ring. These types of sand deposits are caused by extreme water movement, where the larger and heavier sand grains settle first, followed by lighter and smaller grains.|$|E

5|$|Neon is {{the second}} lightest inert gas. Neon has three stable isotopes: 20Ne (90.48%), 21Ne (0.27%) and 22Ne (9.25%). 21Ne and 22Ne are partly {{primordial}} and partly nucleogenic (i.e. made by nuclear reactions of other nuclides with neutrons or other particles in the environment) and their variations in natural abundance are well understood. In contrast, 20Ne (the chief primordial isotope made in stellar nucleosynthesis) is not known to be nucleogenic or radiogenic. The causes of the variation of 20Ne <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> have thus been hotly debated.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen is {{the most}} common pure element <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth,</b> making up 78.1% of the entire volume of the atmosphere. Despite this, it is not very {{abundant}} in Earth's crust, making up only 19parts per million of this, on par with niobium, gallium, and lithium. The only important nitrogen minerals are nitre (potassium nitrate, saltpetre) and sodanitre (sodium nitrate, Chilean saltpetre). However, these have not been an important source of nitrates since the 1920s, when the industrial synthesis of ammonia and nitric acid became common.|$|E
5|$|On Earth it is {{relatively}} rare—5.2 ppm by volume in the atmosphere. Most terrestrial helium present today is created by the natural radioactive decay of heavy radioactive elements (thorium and uranium, although there are other examples), as the alpha particles emitted by such decays consist of helium-4 nuclei. This radiogenic helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations as great as 7% by volume, from which it is extracted commercially by a low-temperature separation process called fractional distillation. Previously, terrestrial helium—a non-renewable resource, because once released into the atmosphere it readily escapes into space—was thought to be in increasingly short supply. However, recent studies suggest that helium produced deep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> by radioactive decay can collect in natural gas reserves in larger than expected quantities, in some cases having been released by volcanic activity.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, gold is a siderophile, or iron-loving element. It does not readily form {{compounds}} with either oxygen or sulfur. At {{the time of}} the Earth's formation, and as the most noble (inert) of metals, gold sank into the core due to its tendency to form high-density metallic alloys. Consequently, it is a relatively rare metal. Some other (less) noble heavy metals—molybdenum, rhenium, the platinum group metals (ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum), germanium, and tin—can be counted as siderophiles but only in terms of their primary occurrence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> (core, mantle and crust), rather the crust. These metals otherwise occur in the crust, in small quantities, chiefly as chalcophiles (less so in their native form).|$|E
5|$|Possibly, it was {{accelerated}} by {{the creation of}} the Deccan Traps, however, some scientists maintain the extinction was caused or exacerbated by other factors, such as volcanic eruptions, climate change, or sea level change, separately or together. A 2016 drilling project into the Chicxulub peak ring confirmed that the peak ring comprised granite ejected within minutes from deep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> (rather than usual seafloor rock), and evidence of colossal seawater movement directly afterwards (from layered sand deposits). Crucially the cores also showed a near complete absence of gypsum, the usual sea floor rock in the region, which is sulfate-containing; this would have been vaporized and dispersed as an aerosol into the atmosphere, providing evidence of a probable link between the impact and a global scale of longer-term effects on the climate and food chain.|$|E
