Wave disturbance can dramatically influence the <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> of the near-surface navigating object. A self-regulating fuzzy <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> method is proposed to keep the small cylindrical object navigate at the expected depth under free-surface disturbance. The near-surface dynamic model of the cylindrical object is presented and the fuzzy <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> method is modeled.

40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about the {{mechanisms}} of bacterial interaction with implant materials in the oral cavity. Other surface characteristics, in addition to surface roughness, seem to be extremely important in relation to plaque formation. Different adhesion affinities of bacteria were reported for different materials. Anatase is a nanoparticle that can be applied to titanium surfaces as a coating. The anatase coating gives special characteristics to the implant surface, including some genetic effects on osteoblasts. In this study, the antibacterial effect of anatase is investigated. The aim {{of this study is to}} characterize the percentages of surfaces covered by bacteria on commercially pure (cp) titanium and anatase-coated healing screws. Methods: Ten patients participated in this study. The protocol of the study was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Chieti-Pescara. A total of 20 healing screws (10 test and 10 <b>control</b> <b>screws)</b> were used in the study. The <b>control</b> <b>screws</b> were made of cp titanium, whereas the test screws were coated with anatase. Cleaning procedures and agents for chemical plaque control were not applied to the healing screws for the complete duration of the test period. After 7 days, all healing screws were removed, substituted, and processed under scanning electron microscopy for evaluation of the portions of the surfaces covered by bacteria. Results: The supracrestal screw surfaces covered by bacteria on test specimens were not significantly lower than those of <b>control</b> <b>screws</b> (P = 0. 174). The subcrestal screw surfaces and threads covered by bacteria on test specimens were significantly lower than those of <b>control</b> <b>screws,</b> and P values were 0. 001 and 0. 000, respectively. Conclusion: Results show that anatase could be a suitable material for coating implant abutments, with a low colonization potential. J Periodontol 2010; 81 : 1466 - 1471...|$|R

In the underwater vehicle industries, the thruster {{is an important part}} in <b>controlling</b> the direction, <b>depth</b> and speed of the ROV.

40|$|During the {{surgical}} preparation of bone, prior to insertion of an implant, bone will be traumatized {{which leads to}} local resorption. Consequently, early implant fixation might be reduced. Impaired early fixation, as evidenced by radiostereometry, {{has been associated with}} increased risk of late loosening. Bisphosphonates are known to inhibit bone resorption by osteoclasts and have shown to increase implant fixation when administered systemically or locally directly at the bone prior to implant insertion. A method to bind bisphosphonates directly to the implant was developed. Stainless steel screws were coated with crosslinked fibrinogen, serving as an anchor for bisphosphonate attachment. The screws were inserted in the tibial metaphysis in rats and implant fixation was analyzed with pullout measurements. Bisphosphonate coated screws turned out to have 28 % higher pullout force at 2 weeks compared to <b>control</b> <b>screws</b> with the fibrinogen coating only. The next experiment was designed to measure at what stage in the healing process the strongest bisphosphonate effect was gained. Bisphosphonate coated screws were expected to reduce the resorption of the traumatized bone. However, no decreased fixation was found in the control group. Instead, the fixation increased with time, and so did the effect of the bisphosphonates. At 8 weeks, the pullout force was twice as high for screws with bisphosphonate compared to <b>control</b> <b>screws.</b> By histology at 8 weeks, a bone envelope was found around bisphosphonate coated screws but absent around <b>control</b> <b>screws.</b> Thus, the anti catabolic action of the bisphosphonate resulted in an increased amount of bone surrounding the bisphosphonate screws. Titanium is generally considered to be better fixated in bone compared to stainless steel. The coating technique was found to be applicable on titanium as well, again with improved fixation. A majority of fractures occur in osteoporotic bone. Despite the relatively low amount of bisphosphonates at the screws, the bisphosphonate coating improved implant fixation at 2 weeks also in rats made osteoporotic by ovariectomy. In conclusion, bisphosphonates bound to titanium or stainless steel screws coated with fibrinogen increased fixation in bone, in rats. These results suggest that the bisphosphonate and fibrinogen coating might improve the fixation of screw shaped implants and possibly also arthroplasties, in humans...|$|R
