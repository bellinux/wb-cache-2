During the season McCaw played his 100th Super Rugby game in a losing effort against the Cape Town-based Stormers. New Zealand recorded victories over the touring Ireland and Wales teams, Ireland losing their match by a record 66–28 after number eight Jamie Heaslip received a red card for <b>kneeing</b> McCaw in the head. The All Blacks went through the TriNations undefeated with the final game of the tournament against Australia marking McCaw's 52nd time captaining the All Blacks, surpassing Sean Fitzpatrick as New Zealand's most-capped test captain.|$|E

40|$|One {{component}} of conventional total <b>knee</b> arthroplasty is {{removal of the}} anterior cruciate ligament, and the <b>knee</b> after total <b>knee</b> arthroplasty has been {{said to be a}} <b>knee</b> with anterior cruciate ligament dysfunction. Bicruciate stabilized total <b>knee</b> arthroplasty is believed to reproduce anterior cruciate ligament function in the implant and provide anterior stability. Conventional total <b>knee</b> arthroplasty was performed on the right <b>knee</b> and bicruciate stabilized total <b>knee</b> arthroplasty was performed on the left <b>knee</b> in the same patient, and a triaxial accelerometer was fitted to both <b>knees</b> after surgery.

40|$|Background：Dynamic <b>knee</b> valgus {{contributes}} to injuries of the {{anterior cruciate ligament}} (ACL). However, {{it is unclear how}} the <b>knee</b> rotates during dynamic <b>knee</b> valgus. <b>Knee</b> rotation significantly affects ACL strain. To understand <b>knee</b> rotation during dynamic <b>knee</b> valgus should help the clinician evaluate dynamic alignment. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine how the <b>knee</b> rotates during dynamic <b>knee</b> valgus and whether the <b>knee</b> rotation is affected by toe direction (foot rotation). Methods：Sixteen females performed dynamic <b>knee</b> valgus in three toe directions (neutral, toe-out, and toe-in) while maintaining the <b>knee</b> flexion angle at 30 °. The <b>knee</b> rotation angle was evaluated using a 7 -camera motion analysis system. <b>Knee</b> rotation was compared between the start position and the dynamic <b>knee</b> valgus position, as well as among the three toe directions, using repeated measures ANOVA models. Results：The <b>knee</b> significantly rotated externally in the dynamic <b>knee</b> valgus position compared with the start position in two toe directions (neutral and toe-out). A similar tendency was observed with the toe-in condition. Toe direction significantly affected the <b>knee</b> rotation angle. For toe-out and toe-in conditions, external and internal shifts of <b>knee</b> rotation compared with neutral were observed. Conclusions：The <b>knee</b> rotates externally during dynamic <b>knee</b> valgus, and the <b>knee</b> rotation is affected by toe direction. Clinical Relevance：Because of <b>knee</b> abduction and external rotation, the ACL may impinge on the femoral condyle in the case of dynamic valgus, especially in the toe-out position...|$|R

Although the fight was originally to take place at World Victory Road's New Year show on December 31, when that event was cancelled, the fight was moved to DREAM's Dynamite!! 2009 card on New Year's Eve as a co-promoted show. Ishii, who was a large favorite in the fight, was dominated in the first round by the more-experienced Yoshida, taking many strikes including a right overhand that staggered the newcomer, along with a series of knees and uppercuts from the clinch. Ishii, however, came back with a more competitive second round, but took a point deduction after illegally <b>kneeing</b> Yoshida in the groin. Ishii continued to find his range in the third round with punches, but ultimately lost via unanimous decision.|$|E
25|$|Ethel lives above Doctor Legg's (Leonard Fenton) {{surgery and}} works as the cleaner in the pub. She is {{somewhat}} of a troublemaker and often spreads the most insane rumours about and gets her words mixed up with hilarious consequences. She is famous for her questionable ability to read-palms and tea-leaves, once even earning a living from it. After Lou's death in 1988 Ethel and Dot become an inseparable double-act and although the two argue constantly, they actually depend on each other a great deal. Despite the fact that Ethel appears totally barmy, she can be quite astute when she wants and she is always the first {{to point out the}} malicious ways of Dot's villainous son, Nick Cotton (John Altman). Ethel is never afraid to stand up to Nick, even <b>kneeing</b> him in the groin once when he attempts to mug her. She also correctly figures out that Nick is trying to poison Dot to get her money, and she refuses to back down, despite Dot falling out with her because of her accusations. Following several falls and a broken hip, Ethel is persuaded to move out of her residence above the surgery and into sheltered housing in 1988. Although she is strongly opposed to this initially, she eventually comes to enjoy her new home, though she would continue to show up in Albert Square regularly.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Poor <b>knee</b> {{function}} after {{anterior cruciate}} ligament reconstruction (ACLR) may {{increase the risk of}} future <b>knee</b> symptoms and <b>knee</b> osteoarthritis via abnormal <b>knee</b> joint loading patterns, particularly during high-impact activity. This study aimed to assess the relationship between poor self-reported or clinically measured <b>knee</b> function and <b>knee</b> moments/vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) in individuals following ACLR. Methods: 61 participants (mean 16. 5 [*]±[*] 3 months following ACLR, 23 women) completed a patient-reported <b>knee</b> function questionnaire and three hop tests (% of uninvolved limb). Participants were divided into satisfactory and poor <b>knee</b> function groups (poor < 85 % patient-reported <b>knee</b> function and/or <[*] 85 % hop test symmetry). The <b>knee</b> biomechanics of both groups were assessed with three-dimensional motion analysis during the stance phase of overland running at self-selected speeds, and the association between <b>knee</b> function and <b>knee</b> moments was assessed using analysis of covariance with running speed as a covariate. Results: Participants with poor <b>knee</b> function (n[*]=[*] 30) ran with significantly smaller peak <b>knee</b> flexion moments (moderate effect size 0. 7, p[*]=[*] 0. 03) and significantly smaller peak vGRFs (large effect size 1. 0, p[*]=[*] 0. 002) compared to those with satisfactory <b>knee</b> function (n[*]=[*] 31). No significant differences were observed for <b>knee</b> adduction and <b>knee</b> external rotation moments or <b>knee</b> kinematics. Conclusion: Individuals following ACLR with poor self-reported <b>knee</b> function and/or hop test performance demonstrate <b>knee</b> moments during running that may be associated with lower <b>knee</b> joint contact forces. These findings provide greater understanding of the relationship between <b>knee</b> biomechanics during running and clinical assessments of <b>knee</b> function. Level of evidence: III.

40|$|Objective: High <b>knee</b> {{extensor}} strength may {{be important}} {{to protect against the}} development of <b>knee</b> osteoarthritis (OA) in populations at elevated risk, such as individuals with meniscal pathology.

2500|$|Both games feature three 'levels' of execution, {{with each}} level {{progressively}} more violent and graphic than the last. Level 1 executions are quick {{and not very}} bloody, Level 2 are considerably more gory, and Level 3 are over-the-top blood-soaked murders. The player him/herself is entirely in control of which level they use; once the player has locked onto an enemy, the lock-on reticule changes color over time to indicate the level; white (level 1), yellow (level 2), and, finally, red (level 3). As an example, in the first game, if using the plastic bag, a level 1 kill involves the player simply using the bag to suffocate the enemy. A level 2 kill involves him placing the bag over the enemy's head and <b>kneeing</b> them repeatedly in the face. A level 3 kill sees him strangle the enemy and turn them around to punch them in the face, whilst the enemy struggles to free himself and gasps for air. Eventually, he snaps the enemy's neck.
