5|$|Music {{was not a}} {{priority}} at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> works by Rossini, Bellini, Verdi and Mozart. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano teacher from Nuremberg, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.|$|E
5|$|Su Song was a Hokkien who {{was born}} in modern-day Fujian, near medieval Quanzhou. Like a contemporary, Shen Kuo (1031–1095), Su Song was a polymath, a person whose {{expertise}} spans a significant number of different interests. It was written by his junior colleague and Hanlin scholar Ye Mengde (1077–1148) that in Su's youth, he mastered the provincial exams and rose {{to the top of the}} examination list for writing the best essay on general principles and structure of the Chinese calendar. From an early age, his interests in astronomy and calendrical science led him onto a distinguished path as a state bureaucrat. In his spare time <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> writing poetry, which he used to praise the works of artists such as the painter Li Gonglin (1049–1106). He also was an antiquarian and collector of old artworks from previous dynasties.|$|E
5|$|For George III, Pitt's {{appointment}} {{was a great}} victory. It proved {{that he was able}} to appoint Prime Ministers on the basis of his own interpretation of the public mood without having to follow the choice of the current majority in the House of Commons. Throughout Pitt's ministry, George supported many of Pitt's political aims and created new peers at an unprecedented rate to increase the number of Pitt's supporters in the House of Lords. During and after Pitt's ministry, George III was extremely popular in Britain. The British people admired him for his piety, and for remaining faithful to his wife. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> his children, and was devastated at the death of two of his sons in infancy in 1782 and 1783 respectively. Nevertheless, he set his children a strict regimen. They were expected to attend rigorous lessons from seven in the morning, and to lead lives of religious observance and virtue. When his children strayed from George's own principles of righteousness, as his sons did as young adults, he was dismayed and disappointed.|$|E

25|$|Kotomitsuki was a yotsu-sumo wrestler, and his {{favourite}} {{grip on the}} mawashi was migi-yotsu, {{with his}} left hand outside and right hand inside his opponent's arms (although he was also capable of fighting in the reverse position, hidari-yotsu). His most common winning kimarite by far was yori-kiri, the force out, followed by oshi-dashi (push out) and hataki-komi (slap down). <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> dashinage (pulling throws, both overarm and underarm), and {{was also one of the}} few rikishi to employ uchi-muso, a technique which involves tapping the opponent's inner thigh with the back of the hand to off-balance him, before twisting him down.|$|E

25|$|When {{he became}} pope in 1978 {{at the age}} of 58, John Paul II was an avid sportsman. He was {{extremely}} healthy and active, jogging in the Vatican gardens, weight training, swimming, and hiking in the mountains. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> football. The media contrasted the new pope's athleticism and trim figure to the poor health of John Paul I and Paul VI, the portliness of John XXIII and the constant claims of ailments of Pius XII. The only modern pope with a fitness regimen had been Pope Pius XI (1922–1939), who was an avid mountaineer. An Irish Independent article in the 1980s labelled John Paul II the keep-fit pope.|$|E
25|$|Following {{his release}} in 1936 after serving two years, Nikolai took {{his family to}} live in Berezniki in Perm Krai, where his brother Ivan, a blacksmith, had been exiled the year before for failing to deliver his grain quota. Nikolai {{remained}} unemployed {{for a period of}} time and then worked again in construction. His mother, Klavdiya Vasilyevna Yeltsina, worked as a seamstress. Boris studied at Pushkin High School in Berezniki. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> sports (in particular skiing, gymnastics, volleyball, track and field, boxing and wrestling) despite losing the thumb and index finger of his left hand when he and some friends furtively entered a Red Army supply depot, stole several grenades, and tried to disassemble them.|$|E
25|$|As a boy he {{attended}} the Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven, Connecticut. Ties of loyalty and interest bound him to this school {{for the rest of}} his life. Active in all its alumni work, he was, more specifically, for many years president of its board of trustees; in 1910, on the occasion of the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the school, he delivered a discourse on its history; when shortly before his death it became necessary to house the school in new quarters, he was one of the largest, if not the largest, of the individual donors whose contributions made possible a set of modern buildings for what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> referring to as the fourth oldest institution of learning in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Eliza Tierney, a 14-year-old servant at Starr's tavern, {{was called}} {{as a witness}} and testified that she had known Whelan for six weeks as a boarder {{who lived in a}} room {{on the first floor of}} the tavern, and that he had owned a pistol for as long as she had known him. However, she discredited the police {{evidence}} suggesting that a shot had been recently fired from Whelan's gun, by offering that one of the other servant girls had handled the pistol clumsily only a week before and shot herself in the arm. This was also confirmed by bookkeeper William Goulden in his testimony, who added that Whelan had offered to sell his pistol just six weeks before McGee was killed. Other evidence suggested that Whelan owned the pistol as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> sport shooting.|$|E
25|$|When Tokitenkū {{began his}} sumo career he weighed around , but he gained weight {{steadily}} and reached about , {{average for the}} top division. He favoured a migi-yotsu grip on the mawashi, {{with his left hand}} outside and right hand inside his opponent's arms. His most common winning technique was yori-kiri, or force out, although he also relied on pull-down techniques such as hataki-komi and hiki-otoshi. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> throwing moves (nage). He was very adept at using tripping techniques which he had gained from his experience in judo, winning 17 career bouts by uchigake (inside leg trip). He also used the extremely rare trip nimaigeri (ankle kicking twist down) on eleven occasions, although he was not credited with the technique in the top division until May 2011 in a win over Shōtenrō. He also appeared to employ it to defeat ōzeki Kotoōshū in March 2007, but the kimarite was given as shitatenage (underarm throw) instead.|$|E
25|$|He was {{conservative}} by nature, and {{his life}} was spent in defending the Reformed theology as {{set forth in the}} Westminster Confession of Faith and Larger and Westminster Shorter Catechisms. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> saying that Princeton had never originated a new idea; but this meant no more than that Princeton was the advocate of historical Calvinism in opposition to the modified and provincial Calvinism of a later day. And it is true that Hodge must be classed among the great defenders of the faith, rather than among the great constructive minds of the Church. He had no ambition to be epoch-making by marking the era of a new departure. But he earned a higher title to fame in that he was the champion of his Church's faith during a long and active life, her trusted leader in time of trial, and {{for more than half a}} century the most conspicuous teacher of her ministry. Hodges' understanding of the Christian faith and of historical Protestantism is given in his Systematic Theology.|$|E
