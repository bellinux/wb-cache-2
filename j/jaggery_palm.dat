If a few drops of lime juice are added to the palm sap, fermentation can be stopped and the sap can then be boiled to form palm syrup, <b>palm</b> sugar, <b>jaggery</b> and numerous other edible products derived from the syrup.In Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, North Africa, Ghana, and Ivory Coast, date palms are tapped for the sweet sap, which is converted into palm sugar (known as jaggery or gur), molasses or alcoholic beverages.

The study consisted of 24 female wistar rats that were divided into four groups. Group-I 0. 5 ml distilled water, Group II, III and IV were orally administered with powdered form of E. microphylla L and adjuvant at 500 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg and only adjuvant (<b>Palm</b> <b>jaggery)</b> respectively. After 10 days, blood samples were taken from all groups in order to measure the serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol hormones. Ovaries and uterus were removed for histopathology. Significant increase in FSH, LH and estradiol levels, ovarian and uterine weight was observed along with enhanced folliculogenesis in the experimental groups.

40|$|Lime {{is arguably}} the world first true green and {{versatile}} building material. The traditional lime binder offers greater durability but less strong compared to cement. The objective {{of the study is}} to improve the strength parameters of lime using traditional herbs. Lime mortar prisms (mix proportion: 1 : 2 i. e., one part of lime to 2 parts of sand) were cast after 15 days of fermentation with traditional herbal extract [aqueous extract of oonjalvalli (Cissus glauca Roxb.), pananchikaai (Cochlospermum religiosum), kulamavu (Persea macrantha), gallnut (Terminalia chebula) and <b>palm</b> <b>jaggery</b> (from Borassus flabellifer) ] and tested for its Flexure, Tension and Compressive strengths. The lime mortar prism fermented with plain water was used as control. The transverse strength of herbal lime mortar (5 % herbs) is 1. 6 times greater than lime mortar fermented with plain water. Besides, there was an increase in the tensile strength by three folds, due to elastic nature of herbal lime mortar. The compressive strength is greatly enhanced up to 2. 5 times on the addition of 5 % herbs. This {{may be due to the}} fact that herbal extract enhanced the density of lime mortar by bringing the particles of lime mortar closer to each other, thereby producing a more compact mass.
