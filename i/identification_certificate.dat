She mapped drop zones for supplies and commandos from England, found safe houses, and linked up with a Jedburgh team after the Allied Forces landed at Normandy. Hall helped train three battalions of Resistance forces to wage guerrilla warfare against the Germans and kept up a stream of valuable reporting until Allied troops overtook her small band in September.|$|E

40|$|Pervasive Computing and Smart Spaces {{promise a}} future wherein the user {{experiences}} personalized service and ubiquity in computation. Among the many problems facing current pervasive computing research {{are the issues}} of secure user identification and secure user mobility support for services. Specifically, we desire an infrastructure that can support mutual authentication between the user and the computing device, and also provide seamless support of computation and service as the user moves from location to location. We would also like the solution to be location aware so as to automatically discover computing devices and service providers {{in the vicinity of}} the user. In this thesis, we have proposed an architecture to support User Identification and User Mobility using heterogeneous handheld wireless devices. This architecture is secure, scalable, QoS-aware and is implemented as a layered protocol stack. Each user has a personal handheld device which stores the <b>identification</b> <b>certificate</b> of the user used for mutual authentication with the service providers and computing devices. The handheld device also stores the state of the service or computation which is used for user mobility support. The Quality of Service is provided by varying the level of security in the system for better performance. Our solution includes a location system for automatically detecting new computing devices based on the location of the user. Such an architecture can be used by any application desiring seamless mobility support. We have specifically demonstrated the system for a video on demand application wherein the user desires to have seamless mobility support for watching a video as he/she moves from location to location. Overall, the thesis provides a novel architecture and mechanism for s [...] ...|$|E
