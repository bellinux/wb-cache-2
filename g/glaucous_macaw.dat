5000|$|The <b>{{glaucous}}</b> <b>macaw</b> is 70 cm long. It {{is mostly}} pale turquoise-blue with a large, greyish head. The term glaucous describes its colouration. It {{has a long}} tail and a large bill. It has a yellow, bare eye ring and half moon-shaped lappets bordering the mandible.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>glaucous</b> <b>macaw</b> (Anodorhynchus glaucus) is a large, all-blue South American parrot, {{a member}} of a large group of neotropical parrots known as macaws. This macaw, {{generally}} believed to be extinct, was closely related to Lear's macaw A. leari and the hyacinth macaw A. hyacinthinus. In Guaran√≠, it was called [...] after its vocalizations.|$|E
5000|$|Glaucous ({{from the}} Latin glaucus, meaning [...] "bluish-gray", from the Greek glaukos) {{is used to}} {{describe}} the pale gray or blue appearance of the surfaces of some plants, {{as well as in the}} names of birds, such as the glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus), glaucous-winged gull (Larus glaucescens), <b>glaucous</b> <b>macaw</b> (Anodorhynchus glaucus), and glaucous tanager (Thraupis glaucocolpa).|$|E
5000|$|The {{majority}} of macaws are now endangered {{in the wild}} and a few are extinct. The Spix's macaw is now probably extinct in the wild. The <b>glaucous</b> <b>macaw</b> is also probably extinct, with only two reliable records of sightings in the 20th century. The greatest problems threatening the macaw population are the rapid rate of deforestation and illegal trapping for the bird trade. Prehistoric Native Americans in the American Southwest farmed macaws in establishments known as [...] "feather factories" ...|$|E
5000|$|According to a 2006 {{report issued}} by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), {{threatened}} species included 32 types of mammals, 55 species of birds, 5 types of reptiles, 30 species of amphibian, 12 species of fish, and 42 species of plants. Endangered species in Argentina include the ruddy-headed goose, Argentinean pampas deer, South Andean huemul, puna rhea, tundra peregrine falcon, black-fronted piping guan, <b>glaucous</b> <b>macaw,</b> spectacled caiman, the broad-nosed caiman, Lear's macaw, the guayaquil great green macaw, and the American crocodile.|$|E
50|$|Anodorhynchus is a genus {{of large}} blue macaws from open and semi-open {{habitats}} {{in central and}} eastern South America. It includes two endangered species, the hyacinth macaw and Lear's macaw also known as the indigo macaw, and one probably extinct species, the <b>glaucous</b> <b>macaw.</b> At about 100 cm in length the hyacinth macaw is the longest parrot in the world. Glaucous and Lear's macaws are exclusively cliff nesters; hyacinth macaws are mostly tree nesters. The three species mainly feed on the nuts from a few species of palms (notably Acrocomia aculeata, Attalea phalerata, Butia yatay and Syagrus coronata).|$|E
50|$|Several {{species and}} one genus have become extinct in recent centuries. A second genus is extinct in the wild. Over {{a third of}} the extant species are {{classified}} as threatened by the IUCN. A few of these are in imminent danger of extinction with fewer than 500 individuals in the wild or in captivity: <b>glaucous</b> <b>macaw,</b> Spix's macaw, blue-throated macaw, Puerto Rican parrot, and indigo-winged parrot. The chief reasons for decline in parrot populations are habitat loss through deforestation by clear-cutting, burning, and flooding by construction of dams, capture for the pet trade, and introduction of non-native predators.|$|E
5000|$|While {{blue macaws}} {{have been known}} from taxidermic and captive {{specimens}} since at least 1790, location of the Lear's macaw's endemic habitat wasn't known until 1978. [...] The <b>glaucous</b> <b>macaw</b> was extirpated in the 1800s by clearance for agriculture and cattle grazing of the yatay palm (Butia yatay) groves upon which it fed, though rumors of its continued existence persist. Lear's macaws have made a comeback from near extinction in the early 1980s (about 60 birds) to over 1000 {{as a result of}} conservation programs. Hyacinth macaws remain locally common within parts of their range, but their range has become fragmented into three known distinct populations in southern Brazil, eastern Bolivia and northeastern Paraguay; populations are declining due to extensive trapping for the pet trade as well as habitat loss.|$|E
