5|$|In 2009, the World Health Organisation (WHO) {{recommended}} that rotavirus vaccine {{be included in}} all national <b>immunisation</b> programmes. The incidence and severity of rotavirus infections has declined significantly in countries that have acted on this recommendation. A 2014 review of available clinical trial data from countries routinely using rotavirus vaccines in their national <b>immunisation</b> programs found that rotavirus vaccines have reduced rotavirus hospitalisations by 49-92 percent and all cause diarrhoea hospitalisations by 17-55 percent. In Mexico, which in 2006 {{was among the first}} countries in the world to introduce rotavirus vaccine, diarrhoeal disease death rates dropped during the 2009 rotavirus season by more than 65 percent among children age two and under. In Nicaragua, which in 2006 became the first developing country to introduce a rotavirus vaccine, severe rotavirus infections were reduced by 40 percent and emergency room visits by a half. In the United States, rotavirus vaccination since 2006 has led to drops in rotavirus-related hospitalisations by as much as 86 percent. The vaccines may also have prevented illness in non-vaccinated children by limiting the number of circulating infections. In developing countries in Africa and Asia, where the majority of rotavirus deaths occur, a large number of safety and efficacy trials as well as recent post-introduction impact and effectiveness studies of Rotarix and RotaTeq have found that vaccines dramatically reduced severe disease among infants. In September 2013, the vaccine was offered to all children in the UK, aged between two and three months, and it is expected to halve the cases of severe infection and reduce the number of children admitted to hospital because of the infection by 70 percent. In Europe, hospitalisation rates following infection by rotavirus have decreased by 65% to 84% following the introduction of the vaccine.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, Burnet's {{research}} {{moved to}} influenza and scrub typhus. With {{the outbreak of}} war, Burnet was handed more responsibility and made acting director and had to oversee the move into a new building as Kellaway was seconded to the military in 1939. Due to Kellaway, many of the infectious disease problems afflicting the military were referred to the institute. Fearing {{a repeat of the}} massive global influenza outbreak that occurred after World War I, Burnet focused the institute in the search for a vaccine. He first tested the vaccine on a group of medical students, and after a promising test on 107 army volunteers in February 1942 following a rise in infections, a large-scale program was introduced two months later to inoculate all new recruits after an influenza A outbreak. In this trial, 20,000 personnel were vaccinated, without success, and the scheme was abandoned. In 1942, the investigations into scrub typhus accelerated after an exodus of researchers in that field from Malaya after the Japanese conquest of the area. However, this ended in tragedy when his collaborator Dora Lush accidentally injected herself and then died of the infection. Nevertheless, his work on <b>immunisation</b> had earned him international recognition by this time.|$|E
5|$|Mugabe's {{government}} {{continued to}} make regular pronouncements about converting Zimbabwe into a socialist society, although did not take concrete steps in that direction. In contrast to Mugabe's talk of socialism, his government's budgetary policies were conservative, operating within a capitalist framework and emphasising the need for foreign investment. In office, Mugabe sought a gradual transformation away from capitalism and tried to build upon existing state institutions. From 1980 to 1990, the country's economy grew {{by an average of}} 2.7% a year, but this was outstripped by population growth and real income declined. The unemployment rate rose, reaching 26% in 1990. The government ran a budget deficit year-on-year that averaged at 10% of the country's gross domestic product. Under Mugabe's leadership, there was a massive expansion in education and health spending. In 1980, Zimbabwe had 177 secondary schools, but by 2000 this number had risen to 1,548. During that period, the adult literacy rate rose from 62% to 82%, one of the best records in Africa. Levels of child <b>immunisation</b> were raised from 25% of the population to 92%.|$|E
5|$|The French {{started their}} {{evacuation}} with their pre-conceived notion that few {{would want to}} head south. As knowledge of the migration program spread through the communist-controlled north, thousands of predominantly northern Catholic asylum-seekers descended on the capital Hanoi and the port of Haiphong, {{both of which were}} still in French control. This led to anarchy and confusion as the emigrants fought over limited shelter, food, medicine and places on the ships and planes that were bound for the south. By early August, there were over 200,000evacuees waiting in Hanoi and Haiphong. Initially the ad hoc camps had insufficient sanitation and water quality control, leading to the possibility of outbreaks of disease. Some American representatives said that they were the worst conditions they had seen. The conditions continued to be poor and chaotic after the evacuation got into full swing, and did not improve significantly for a month. There was no organization infrastructure as far as registration or medical records and <b>immunisation</b> of the waiting evacuees. The communists thus sent their propaganda activists through the camps and said that the lack of organisation proved that life for prospective refugees would be even worse in the south, where they would be completely under the control of South Vietnam.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{fact that}} some cancers and viral infections can be {{controlled}} by effector CD 8 T cells led {{to the possibility of}} utilising minimal CD 8 T cell epitope peptides as vaccines. However using minimal CD 8 T cell epitope peptide <b>immunisations</b> and a tumour protection model in mice, we have previously shown that functional memory CD 8 T cells are not generated unless CD 4 T help is provided at the time of CD 8 T cell priming. Short-lived effector cells nevertheless are generated in the absence of T help. Aim: To determine the role of CD 4 T help in multiple <b>immunisations.</b> Method: Minimal CD 8 T cell peptides of HPV 16 E 7 protein and Ovalbumin were used (with adjuvants Quil-A or IFA) as immunogens in C 57 BL mice. The presence of effector CD 8 T cells were determined by tumour protection assays and was quantified by IFN-gamma ELISPOT assays. Results: In the present study we show that unless T help is provided at the time CD 8 T cells are primed, no CD 8 effector cells are generated when boosted with the vaccine again in the absence of T help. Our results further show that this failure could be prevented by the inclusion of a T helper peptide during the primary or booster <b>immunisations...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{association}} between parents in Liverpool consenting {{to their children}} being invited for primary <b>immunisations</b> and five sociodemographic factors, namely sex, position of child in the family, family type, migration into Liverpool since birth, and local deprivation was examined. Rates of consent to invitation were over 97 % for each antigen except pertussis, which had a consent rate of 83 %. Consent to invitation for pertussis vaccine was least {{likely to have been}} given for boys, children with older siblings, those recorded as living with a single parent, and those in the most deprived areas. Local deprivation also had an effect on consent to the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. Migration into Liverpool had a significant effect on consent to invitation for all antigens except pertussis. The child's sex, family type, and local deprivation had no effect on consent to diphtheria, tetanus, and polio <b>immunisations.</b> Maximising pertussis vaccine uptake will require more attention to be paid to those parents who have been identified as being less likely to give consent. It is particularly important that consistent and clear advice about <b>immunisations</b> is made available to parents with two or more children, lone parents, and those living in materially deprived areas. Our findings challenge some of the assumptions underlying the principles of 'first parent visiting', at least so far as pertussis is concerned...|$|R
