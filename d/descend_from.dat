50|$|Two {{languages}} {{are considered to}} be genetically related if one is <b>descended</b> <b>from</b> the other or if both are <b>descended</b> <b>from</b> a common ancestor.

Therefore, Spanish and Italian are genetically related. In a similar way, Danish, Swedish and Norwegian are genetically related through the North Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family.|$|R

5|$|The Bajovići, {{having the}} slava (patron saint day) of St. Nicholas, {{with tens of}} houses in Bezuje, and one house in their {{original}} village of Rudinice (1971), have several versions of their origin: the first that they <b>descend</b> <b>from</b> a brother of Bajo Pivljanin; the second, from a villager called Čepur that took over Bajo Pivljanin's estate after the family left; the third, that the Bajovići who were really called Čepuri until 1887 <b>descend</b> <b>from</b> a branch of a family tree also including the Vračari and Taušani, {{closely related to the}} Gagovići, in line with their slava in common. Based on the presumed connection with Pivljanin, King Nikola I accepted member Đorđija Bajović into officer school. When S. Tomić did field research in Piva in 1912–13 and 1924, however, he recorded the Bajovići, called Čepuri in Gornje Rudinice with two houses, as hailing from Bajovo Polje and being direct descendants of Bajo Nikolić Pivljanin.
