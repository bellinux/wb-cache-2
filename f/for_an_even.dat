5|$|A {{comparable}} chamber work <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> {{more unusual}} set of instruments, the Capriccio for piano left hand, flute, two trumpets, three trombones and tenor tuba, {{was written for}} pianist Otakar Hollmann, who lost {{the use of his}} right hand during World War I. After its première in Prague on 2 March 1928, the Capriccio gained considerable acclaim in the musical world.|$|E
5|$|Lloyd George did however {{win some}} loyalty from Keynes with his actions at the Paris conference by {{intervening}} against the French {{to ensure the}} dispatch of much-needed food supplies to German civilians. Clemenceau also pushed for substantial reparations, though {{not as high as}} those proposed by the British, while on security grounds, France argued <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> more severe settlement than Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Home Movies co-creator Brendon Small, and was the final episode of the series' {{production}} run. The episode was the fifty-second of the series, a number that allows <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> distribution of reruns of the series; Small noted that the technique is normally used on animated children's shows, though Home Movies is actually created for an adult audience.|$|E

5|$|In September 1980, in the {{aftermath}} of the labor agreements, First Secretary Gierek was removed from office and replaced as party leader by Stanisław Kania. Kania made promises of the sort that Gomułka and Gierek had made when each came power. But whatever goodwill the new leader gained, it lasted <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> shorter period than it had been the case in 1956 and 1971, because there was no way that the regime could have kept the promises it had made at Gdańsk, even if it wanted to. The authorities were still trapped by the contradiction: if they followed economic necessity, they would generate political instability. GNP fell in 1979 by 2%, in 1980 by 8% and in 1981 by 15–20%.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s, the Austro-Hungarian Navy {{began to}} build armored cruisers to support the battle fleet and to perform some of the roles then {{reserved}} only for battleships. The first vessel, , was built as an enlarged version of the protected cruiser , with a more powerful armament and heavier armor. She was followed by an improved cruiser, , which provided the basis <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> larger ship, which was named Sankt Georg. Each iteration carried a heavier armament and had a higher top speed than the preceding design.|$|E
5|$|Other {{researchers}} {{hypothesize that}} another alternative growth strategy will evolve in the P. rebeli, {{in which the}} P. rebeli will parasitize the M. schencki ants <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> {{longer period of time}} than the slow developing larvae. Most researchers, however, find this hypothesis highly unlikely because it is not an evolutionarily stable strategy. At the rate the P. rebeli parasitizes the M. schencki ants, the host colony is unlikely to last as a viable food source {{for more than two years}} (the average lifespan of the longer polymorph of P. rebeli). Once the host colony reaches its lifespan of two years and dies, the P. rebeli loses its food source and dies as well.|$|E

5|$|By late 1962 a {{decision}} {{on whether or not}} to deploy Zeus was looming. Bell began considering a replacement for the Zeus missile that would operate at much shorter ranges, and in October, sent out study contracts to three contractors to be returned in February. Even before these were returned, in January 1963 McNamara announced that the construction funds allocated for Zeus would not be released, and the funding would instead be used for development of a new system using the latest technologies. The name Nike-X was apparently an ad hoc suggestion by Jack Ruina, the director of ARPA, who was tasked with presenting the options to the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC). With the ending of Zeus, the ZMAR radar effort was renamed MAR, and plans <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> more powerful version, MAR-II, became {{the central part of the}} Nike-X concept.|$|E
5|$|Catastrophic {{injuries}} {{have been}} on a steady decline since the 1960s, due in part to rules banning dangerous forms of contact such as spearing, face tackling and butt blocking. However, catastrophic injuries are still caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions, as well when players hit their heads against an opposing player's knee or the ground. Returning to play after sustaining a head injury earlier in the game also places players at risk <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> more severe injury. Many states are requiring teams to prevent players who have shown any signs of a concussion from returning to a game, while other steps such as more aggressive enforcement of safety rules and better condition of the neck muscles have been suggested. Additionally, coaches are being urged to train players to block with their shoulders instead of their heads.|$|E
5|$|Passage of the {{national}} Civil Rights Act of 1964 had paved the way <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> stronger civil rights bill in the 1966 legislative session. The Assembly easily passed the Kentucky Civil Rights Act opening all public accommodations to people of every race and prohibiting racial discrimination in employment by firms that employed eight or more people. The act applied to many kinds of businesses {{not covered by the}} federal statute, and approximately ninety percent of the businesses in Kentucky were affected, compared to only sixty percent that were covered by the federal statute. The act was {{the first of its kind}} passed in a southern state. In 1966, Breathitt was presented with the Lincoln Key Award for his leadership in the bill's passage. In 1966 and 1967, he was chair of the Southern Governors' Conference's Committee on Regional and Interstate Cooperation. He was also the only state governor named to the President's Council on Human Rights.|$|E

25|$|The EC155 B1 was {{developed}} with more powerful engines, giving it improved performance at high altitude and in hot temperature conditions; this derivative {{also features a}} higher maximum take-off weight (10,846lb vs. 10,580lb). Deliveries of this model began in November 2002 with the Hong Kong Government Flying Service becoming the first operator. In early 2003, Eurocopter completed studies <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> more powerful version of the EC155 B1, designed to better compete with new rotorcraft such as the AgustaWestland AW139 and to better meet military customer's requirements.|$|E
25|$|Within each classification, the UIL {{separates}} {{the schools in}} regions, and then further {{separates the}} regions into districts for various contests. The districts are numbered from 1 (in far west Texas) to 32 (in south Texas). There are always 32 districts in Class AAAAAA and Class AAAAA, but the smaller classifications may have numbers skipped {{based on the number}} of schools in the classification. No more than 10 schools are permitted in a single district unless all schools and the UIL consent otherwise; the preference is <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> number of schools in each district (6, 8, 10) though in some cases travel issues may prevent such.|$|E
25|$|The {{reign of}} King Sigismund III of Poland is often spoken {{of as the}} {{beginning}} of the end of the Polish Golden Age. In terms of worldly success he certainly met with many defeats and setbacks. Yet, he was also one of the great Catholic leaders of Europe and his reign can also be seen as one of many opportunities <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> greater Poland. He was stubborn, but a man of principle who would follow the hard but upright path rather than compromise his values for a more sure chance at success. As a monarch who reigned during the Counter-Reformation he constantly worked to see the restoration of all of his subjects to the true faith embodied in the Church of Rome headed by the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church.|$|E
