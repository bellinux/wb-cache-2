40|$|Background: Chronic non-healing wounds {{present a}} {{substantial}} economic burden to healthcare system; significant reductions in {{quality of life}} for those affected, and precede often serious events such as limp amputations or even premature deaths. This burden is also likely to increase with a larger proportion of elderly and increasing prevalence of life-style diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Reviews of the evidence on the burden of illness associated with chronic wounds have not been comprehensive in scope and have not provided an assessment of the distribution of the health care costs across categories of resource use. Methods/design: This study is a systematic review of multiple databases for studies on adult patients with chronic wounds and with the primary objective to assess the impact on health-related quality of life by category of ulcers, and associated direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>costs.</b> <b>Eligible</b> studies will primary be empirical studies evaluating, describing or comparing measurement of quality of life and economic impact. Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts and select studies involving adults with chronic wounds. These investigators will also independently extract data using a pre-designed data extraction form. Differences in applied methodologies and uncertainties will clearly be accounted for. Conservative valuations of costs and impact on health-related quality of life will be prioritised. Variations that may depend on age distribution, the categorisation of ulcer, healthcare system etc. will be described clearly. Discussion: The proposed systematic review will yield a comprehensive assessment of the humanistic and economic burden of chronic wounds in an adult population. A better understanding of the humanistic and economic burden of chronic wounds is essential for policy and planning purposes, to monitor trends in disease burden and not at least in order to estimate the real-world cost-effectiveness of new treatments and therapies.

50|$|The SCC {{was created}} on July 18, 2000 when the New Jersey Educational Facilities Construction and Financing Act was signed into law. The law created {{a program for}} financing, design, renovation, repair and new {{construction}} of primary and secondary schools in New Jersey. The law significantly changed the level of State aid for public school construction. Previously, school districts received State aid for construction debt {{at the same percentage}} as their State aid for operating costs, making almost half of the State's school districts ineligible for any construction aid. The new law guaranteed construction aid for every school district in New Jersey. The minimum level of aid was 40%, and Abbott Districts received 100% of <b>eligible</b> <b>costs.</b> Cost overruns and charges of corruption led to criticism of the SCC. Delays and added costs led to unfinished buildings and the lack of funds to complete existing and planned projects.|$|R

40|$|A {{comparison}} of explicit and fuzzy approaches {{to identify their}} similarities and differences is carried out. In the problem of distribution of resources of information protection {{the principles of the}} formation of the membership functions to the fuzzy sets and their effect on the final results are analyzed. It is shown that the fuzzy approach gives the possibility to optimize the indicators of the system of information security through a rational choice of the membership functions, which reflect the basic characteristic of the objects - their dynamic vulnerability. Through the example of the system of two objects with different vulnerabilities the conditions under which the highest level of results coincidence is achieved using two approaches are established. The technique can be used when calculating the <b>eligible</b> <b>costs</b> of information systems with an arbitrary number of objects that have different volume of the placed information, vulnerability and level of acceptable losses. The ways of further application of the method in problems of information security are identified. ????????? ????????? ??????? ? ????????? ???????? ? ????? ????????? ?? ????? ???? ? ????????. ? ?????? ????????????? ???????? ?????? ?????????? ???????????????? ???????? ???????????? ??????? ?????????????? ? ???????? ?????????? ? ?? ??????? ?? ???????? ??????????. ????????, ??? ???????? ?????? ???? ??????????? ?????????????? ?????????? ??????? ?????? ?????????? ?? ???? ????????????? ?????? ??????? ??????????????, ??????? ???????? ???????? ?????????????? ???????? ? ?? ???????????? ??????????. ?? ??????? ??????? ?? ???? ???????? ? ?????????? ???????????? ??????????? ???????, ??? ??????? ??????????? ????????? ??????? ?????????? ??????????? ??? ????????????? ???? ????????. ???????? ????? ???? ???????????? ??? ??????? ?????????? ?????? ? ?????????????? ???????? ? ???????????? ??????????? ????????, ??????? ?????????? ??????? ??????????? ??????????, ??????????? ? ??????? ?????????? ??????. ?????????? ???? ??????????? ?????????? ??????????? ???????? ? ??????? ?????????????? ????????????...|$|R
