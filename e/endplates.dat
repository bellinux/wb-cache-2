40|$|Purpose – This study aims {{to reveal}} more {{information}} and understanding on performance and failure mechanisms of high strength steel <b>endplate</b> connections after fire. Design/methodology/approach – An experimental and numerical study on seven <b>endplate</b> connections after cooling down from fire temperature of 550 °C {{has been carried out}} and reported herein. Moreover, the provisions of European design standard for steel structures, Eurocode 3, were validated with test results of high strength steel <b>endplate</b> connections. Findings – In <b>endplate</b> connections, a proper design using a thinner high strength steel <b>endplate</b> can achieve the same failure mode, similar residual load bearing capacity and comparable or even higher rotation capacity after cooling down from fire. It is found that high strength steel <b>endplate</b> connection can regain more than 90 per cent of its original load bearing capacity after cooling down from fire temperature of 550 °C. Originality/value – The post-fire performance of high strength steel <b>endplate</b> connection has been reported.

40|$|The loose patch {{voltage clamp}} {{has been used}} to map Na current density along the length of snake and rat {{skeletal}} muscle fibers. Na currents have been recorded from (a) <b>endplate</b> membrane exposed by removal of the nerve terminal, (b) membrane near the <b>endplate,</b> (c) extrajunctional membrane far from both the <b>endplate</b> and the tendon, and (d) membrane near the tendon. Na current densities recorded directly on the <b>endplate</b> were extremely high, exceeding 400 mA/cm 2 in some patches. The membrane adjacent to the <b>endplate</b> has a current density about fivefold lower than that of the <b>endplate,</b> but about fivefold higher than the membrane 100 - 200 micron from the <b>endplate.</b> Small local variations in Na current density are recorded in extrajunctional membrane.

There was also no obvious difference in the kinetics of Na current in the two regions. On the basis of the Na current densities measured with the loose patch clamp, we conclude that Na channels are abundant in the <b>endplate</b> and near- <b>endplate</b> membrane and are sparse close to the tendon.

A non-points scoring finish in Canada, followed victory in France, a victory which he later described as the most memorable of his career which also happened to be McLaren's only ever win at the Magny-Cours circuit. A hat-trick of podiums followed in the next three rounds and secured a fourth-place finish in Belgium. Coulthard was involved in a multi-car collision on the first lap in Italy. This would be marked by scoring points in the final three rounds, including podiums in Japan and Malaysia. Coulthard finished third in the Drivers' Championship, with 73 points, and McLaren finished second in the Constructors' Champions.

For this reason, an in-depth study is necessary on the vertebral <b>endplate</b> cutting process. This paper is intended to simulate and analyze the cutting process of vertebral <b>endplate</b> using numerical computation method. Firstly, a plane cutting model is established through an analysis on the cutting process to simulate the single-edge cutting process, and the temperature distribution calculation is carried out using the mean heat flux of continuous cutting. Secondly, a vertebral <b>endplate</b> material constitutive model is established {{on the basis of}} the <b>endplate</b> anatomy and mechanical property, so that some problems are analyzed about simulation algorithm, frictional contact and chip separation in the vertebral <b>endplate</b> cutting finite element (FE) simulation.

The FE simulation may simplify vertebral <b>endplate</b> cutting, improve analytical precision, avoid plenty of repetitive cutting experiments, and reduce research cost greatly. Moreover, it gives full and fine description to the whole continuous, dynamic cutting process.

2500|$|The {{signaling}} {{process to}} contract or relax the sternocleidomastoid begins in Cranial Nerve XI, the accessory nerve. The accessory nerve nucleus {{is in the}} anterior horn of the spinal cord around C1-C3, where lower motor neuron fibers mark its origin. The fibers from the accessory nerve nucleus travel upward to enter the cranium via the foramen magnum. The internal carotid artery to reach both the sternocleidomastoid muscles and the trapezius. After a signal reaches the accessory nerve nucleus in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, the signal is conveyed to motor <b>endplates</b> on the muscle fibers located at the clavicle. Acetylcholine (ACH) is released from vesicles and is sent over the synaptic cleft to receptors on the postsynaptic bulb. The ACH causes the resting potential to increase above -55mV, thus initiating an action potential which travels along the muscle fiber. Along the muscle fibers are t-tubule openings which facilitate {{the spread of the}} action potential into the muscle fibers. The t-tubule meets with the sarcoplasmic reticulum at locations throughout the muscle fiber, at these locations the sarcoplasmic reticulum releases calcium ions that results in the movement of troponin and tropomyosin on thin filaments. The movement of troponin and tropomyosin is key in facilitating the myosin head to move along the thin filament, resulting in a contraction of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.|$|E

The cutoff frequency of each spectral component was equal to the decay rate of its corresponding constituent of the miniature <b>endplate</b> current. Comparison of the relative amplitudes of the spectral and miniature <b>endplate</b> components indicated that QX 222 did not act by creating two kinetically distinct populations of acetylcholine receptors. QX 222 action could be explained by alteration of the acetylcholine receptors such that they sequentially change conformation form one open state to another.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} (1) {{effects of}} <b>endplate</b> removal and bone mineral density (BMD) on biomechanical properties of lumbar vertebrae (2) whether the distributions of mechanical strength and stiffness of <b>endplate</b> {{are affected by}} BMD. METHODS: A total of thirty-one lumbar spines (L 1 -L 5) collected from fresh cadavers were used in this study. Bone density was measured using lateral DEXA scans and parts of samples were performed with partial or entire <b>endplate</b> removal. All the specimens were divided into three BMD groups.

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{of the effects of}} several quaternary ammonium ions has been made on the intracellularly recorded <b>endplate</b> potential of curarized frog muscle.

The results suggest a relationship between rate of rise of the <b>endplate</b> potential and the probability of spike generation. Using the neurally evoked contractile response as a signal of transmitter action, the hydroxyanilinium ions were found to be relatively weak antagonists of tubocurarine at deep levels of curarization, indicating a ceiling effect.

However, the underlying molecular mechanism for the degeneration of cartilaginous <b>endplate</b> remains elusive. Herein, we found that oxidative stress could induce apoptosis and autophagy in <b>endplate</b> chondrocytes evidenced by western blot analysis, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence staining, GFP-LC 3 B transfection, and MDC staining.

Methods: In this study, 44 patients who underwent single-level posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) using cage were examined from April 2007 to March 2009. All patients had been diagnosed as osteoporosis and would be recommended for alendronate medication. <b>Endplate</b> degeneration is categorized by the Modic changes. The solid fusion is defined if there was bridging bone between the vertebral bodies, either within or external to the cage on the plain X-ray and if there is less than 5 ° of angular difference in dynamic X-ray. Results: In alendronate group, fusion was achieved in 66. 7 % compared to 73. 9 % in control group (no medication). Alendronate did not influence the fusion rate of PLIF.

The FSU were axially loaded (200, 1, 000, 1, 500 - 2, 000 N) within a custom made radiolucent, saline filled loading device.
