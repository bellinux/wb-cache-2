When the graph is already acyclic, its smallest feedback vertex sets and feedback arc sets are empty, and its condensation is the graph itself.|$|E

Cascelloid stated that Hack reviewed and evaluated the entire inventory of lemons at Fortnum and Mason’s, Selfridges, Harrods and Covent Garden, the latter of which involved examining three cases of lemons that contained around 300 lemons in each case.|$|E
