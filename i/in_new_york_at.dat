5|$|Highway405 {{serves to}} connect the {{northern}} end of I-190 <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>at</b> the Lewiston–Queenston Bridge with the QEW, and as such it follows a somewhat direct path between the two.|$|E
5|$|NY146 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>At</b> the time, NY146 began at modern NY443 in Berne and followed what is now NY156 northeast to Altamont while modern NY146 west of Altamont was part of NY156. The alignments of the two routes were flipped in the late 1930s. Other minor realignments have occurred since, most notably near Mechanicville.|$|E

He was appointed to West Point's Board of Visitors in 1881.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of modern}} NY12E was {{originally}} designated {{as part of}} NY3 in 1924. NY3 was moved onto its current alignment east of Watertown {{as part of the}} 1930 renumbering of state highways <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> <b>at</b> which time its former routing between Watertown and Clayton became NY12E. From Watertown to Limerick, what is now NY12E was originally NY12F. The alignments of the two routes were flipped in the late 1930s. In 1980, Jefferson County assumed maintenance of NY12E between the Watertown city line and Brownville as part of a highway maintenance swap between the county and the state. This section is now county-maintained as County Route190 (CR190).|$|E
5|$|NY28 was {{originally}} assigned in 1924 to an alignment extending from Colliersville {{in the south}} to Utica in the north via Ilion. From Colliersville to Cooperstown, the highway followed its current routing (excluding minor realignments); north of Cooperstown, NY28 was routed along several state highways that now have other designations. The route was extended south to Kingston and north to Warrensburg as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, NY28 was realigned between Cooperstown and Mohawk to follow its modern routing. Other than minor realignments in Kingston, Oneonta, and Oneida County, NY28 has remained the same to this day.|$|E

5|$|NY348 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>At</b> the time, it began at NY22 in West Chazy and ended at US11 in the village of Champlain. NY348 had an overlap with US9 from Chazy to what is now NY9B in the town of Champlain. Here, US9 forked to the east and followed the length of modern NY9B to Rouses Point. NY348 was extended east to Rouses Point along US11 and what is now NY276 by the following year.|$|E
5|$|Rebecca Clarke (27 August 1886– 13 October 1979) was an English {{classical}} {{composer and}} violist {{best known for}} her chamber music featuring the viola. She was born in Harrow and studied at the Royal Academy of Music and Royal College of Music in London, later becoming one of the first female professional orchestral players. Stranded in the United States at the outbreak of World War II, she settled permanently in New York City and married composer and pianist James Friskin in 1944. Clarke died at her home <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>at</b> the age of 93.|$|E
5|$|Route216 was {{originally}} part of NY39 in the 1920s. The portion of NY39 from Stormville to West Patterson was redesignated {{as part of}} NY52 in the 1930 renumbering of state highways <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, an alternate route of NY52 between Stormville and Towners was assigned the NY216 designation. The alignments of NY52 and NY216 between the two locations were largely swapped in 1937. In 1970, Route216 was truncated to its current eastern terminus in Poughquag.|$|E

5|$|The {{team with}} the best record to win the National League pennant was the 1906 Cubs, who won 116 of 152 games during that season and {{finished}} 20 games ahead of the Giants, playing <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>at</b> the time. The best record by a pennant-winner in the Championship Series era is 108–54, which was achieved by the Cincinnati Reds in 1975 and the New York Mets in 1986; both of these teams {{went on to win}} the World Series.|$|E
5|$|What is now NY45 was {{originally}} designated NY305 {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, the portion of modern NY305 north of Portville in Cattaraugus and Allegany counties was assigned NY94, while the current NY94 in Orange County was designated NY45. The NY305 and NY94 designations were swapped in the early 1940s, placing NY305 on its current alignment and NY94 on what is now NY45. NY94 was then swapped again, this time for NY45, on January 1, 1949, placing both routes on their modern routings.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the portion}} {{of what is now}} NY370 from Cato to Liverpool was state-maintained by 1926, it {{remained}} unnumbered until the late 1920s. At that time, the section west of then-NY31 (now NY48) in Baldwinsville became NY37. The designation proved to be short-lived as it was renumbered to NY370 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, NY40 was split into several different routes. From Cato to just east of Red Creek, old NY40 became part of the new NY370, which also extended southeastward to NY57 in Liverpool. The small segment of former NY40 from NY3 to Upton Road was included in NY3E (later US104).|$|E

5|$|Following {{this decline}} in her career, Hepburn took action to create her own {{comeback}} vehicle. She left Hollywood {{to look for}} a stage project, and signed on to star in Philip Barry's new play, The Philadelphia Story. It was tailored to showcase the actress, with the character of socialite Tracy Lord incorporating a mixture of humor, aggression, nervousness, and vulnerability. Howard Hughes, Hepburn's partner at the time, sensed that the play could be her ticket back to Hollywood stardom and bought her the film rights before it even debuted on stage. The Philadelphia Story first toured the United States, to positive reviews, and then opened <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>at</b> the Schubert Theatre on March 28, 1939. It was a big hit, critically and financially, running for 417 performances and then going on a second successful tour.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, Isabella fell ill. She recovered, but {{the illness}} recurred the {{following}} year, {{and she became}} an invalid. John Macdonald took his wife to Savannah, Georgia, in the United States in 1845, hoping that the sea air and warmth would cure her ailments. Although John Macdonald was {{able to return to}} Canada after six months, Isabella remained in the United States for three years. He visited her again <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>at</b> the end of 1846, and returned several months later when she informed him she was pregnant. In August 1847 their son John Alexander Macdonald Jr. was born in New York, but as Isabella remained ill, relatives cared for the infant.|$|E
5|$|Lady Gaga: Queen of Pop has 288 pages, {{including}} 32 {{pages of}} photographs of the musician. The author compares Lady Gaga to Madonna, writing that both are independent and work to assert control over their futures. The book discusses Lady Gaga's early life and background, including her upbringing in a New York City household with her father, a businessman. Born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta on March 28, 1986, from age 11 she attended Convent of the Sacred Heart high school; the same high school as Paris Hilton. Germanotta was not popular with her fellow pupils because of her experimentation with exotic dance, drugs, and bisexuality. By age 13, she had written her first song and her mother took her to nightclubs to perform at open-mic events. Germanotta gained entry to the Tisch School of the Arts <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>at</b> age 17, but left and started using drugs while performing as a go-go dancer. After a period of difficulty with her father, she ceased this behavior pattern.|$|E

5|$|Like a Virgin is {{the second}} studio album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Madonna, released on November 12, 1984, by Sire Records. Following the success of her self-titled debut album, Madonna wanted to become the record producer of her next album. However, her label {{was not ready to}} give her the artistic freedom and she chose Nile Rodgers instead to produce the album due to his work with David Bowie. Madonna wrote six songs on the record, five of which feature Steve Bray as a co-writer. The album was recorded at Power Station Studio <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>at</b> a quick pace. Rodgers enlisted the help of his former Chic bandmates Bernard Edwards, who was the bassist, and Tony Thompson, who played drums. Jason Corsaro, the record's audio engineer, persuaded Rodgers to use digital recording, a new technique introduced at that time.|$|E
5|$|NY78 was {{replaced}} by NY44 (now NY414) {{in the vicinity of}} Watkins Glen as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, two parts of the pre-1921 routing of Route46 east of Seneca Lake were assigned posted route numbers for the first time. From just northeast of Watkins Glen to Reynoldsville, the old road became part of NY227, which initially extended from NY44 (now NY414) near Watkins Glen to NY79 in Perry City. While Route46 veered southeast from Reynoldsville to serve Mecklenburg, NY227 proceeded northeast from the former to connect to Perry City. The portion of old Route46 north of Perry City became part of NY79.|$|E
5|$|Tubman {{was busy}} during this time, giving talks to {{abolitionist}} audiences and tending to her relatives. In {{the autumn of}} 1859, as Brown and his men prepared to launch the attack, Tubman could not be contacted. When the raid on Harpers Ferry took place on October 16, Tubman was not present. Some historians believe she was <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>at</b> the time, ill with fever related to her childhood head injury. Others propose {{she may have been}} recruiting more escaped slaves in Ontario, and Kate Clifford Larson suggests she may have been in Maryland, recruiting for Brown's raid or attempting to rescue more family members. Larson also notes that Tubman may have begun sharing Frederick Douglass's doubts about the viability of the plan.|$|E
