5|$|As {{traditionally}} defined, spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>rays</b> {{are found}} globally in tropical regions from the Indo-Pacific region {{from the western}} Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the western Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The dorsal spots {{make the}} {{spotted eagle ray}} an {{aquarium}} attraction, although because of its large size it is likely kept only at public aquariums. There are no target fisheries for the spotted eagle ray, but it is often eaten after being caught unintentionally as bycatch. There have been several reported incidents of spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>rays</b> leaping {{out of the water}} onto boats and landing on people. Nevertheless, spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>rays</b> do not pose a significant threat to humans, as they are shy and generally avoid human contact. Interactions with an individual snorkeler in the Caribbean has been reported especially in Jamaica involving one, two and even three spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>rays.</b> The rays may exhibit a behavior similar to human curiosity which allows the snorkeler to observe the eagle ray who may slow down so as to share more time with the much slower human observer if the human observer appears to be unthreatening or interesting to the spotted eagle ray.|$|E
5|$|As other rays, spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>rays</b> are host to {{a variety}} of parasites. Internal parasites include the gnathostomatid {{nematode}} Echinocephalus sinensis in the spiral intestine. External parasites include the monocotylid monogeneans Decacotyle octona, Decacotyle elpora and Thaumatocotyle pseudodasybatis on the gills.|$|E
50|$|The ocellated <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> (Aetobatus ocellatus) is {{a species}} of {{cartilaginous}} fish in the <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> family Myliobatidae. It {{is found in the}} tropical Indo-West Pacific region. In the past it was included in the spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> (A. narinari), a species restricted to the Atlantic after the split.|$|R
5|$|The spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> {{has many}} {{different}} common names, including white-spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>ray,</b> bonnet skate, bonnet ray, duckbill ray and spotted duck-billed ray.|$|R
5|$|Within these regions, {{there are}} {{significant}} variations in genetics and morphology. As a consequence, recent authorities have split it into three: This restricts the true spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> (A. narinari) to the Atlantic, while the Indo-Pacific population is the ocellated <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> (A. ocellatus) and the East Pacific is the Pacific white-spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> (A. laticeps).|$|R
5|$|Spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>rays</b> {{are found}} in warm and {{temperate}} waters worldwide. In the western Atlantic Ocean it is found off the eastern coast of United States of America, the Gulf Stream, the Caribbean, and down past {{the southern part of}} Brazil. In the Indian Ocean, it is found from the Red Sea down to South Africa and eastward to the Andaman Sea. In the Western Pacific Ocean it can be found near Japan and north of Australia. In the Central Pacific Ocean, it can be found throughout the Hawaiian Islands. In the Eastern-Pacific Ocean, it is found in the Gulf of California down through Puerto Pizarro, an area that includes the Galapagos Islands. Spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>rays</b> are most commonly seen in bays and reefs. They spend much of their time swimming freely in open waters, generally in schools close to the surface, and can travel long distances in a day.|$|E
5|$|Spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>rays,</b> {{in common}} with many other rays, often fall victim to sharks such as the tiger shark, the lemon shark, the bull shark, the silver tip shark, and the great hammerhead shark. A great hammerhead shark has been {{observed}} attacking a spotted eagle ray in open water by taking a large bite {{out of one of}} its pectoral fins, thus incapacitating the ray. The shark then used its head to pin the ray to the bottom and pivoted to take the ray in its jaws, head first. Sharks have also been observed to follow female rays during the birthing season, and feed on the newborn pups.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the {{silvertip shark}} {{consists}} primarily of bony fishes, such as grouper, mackerel, tuna, escolars, lanternfish, flyingfish, wrasses, and soles. <b>Eagle</b> <b>rays,</b> smaller sharks, and octopus are occasionally taken. Larger sharks {{tend to be}} more sluggish and take more benthic prey. The differently shaped dentition in their upper and lower jaws allows them to tackle large prey, gripping and sawing off chunks of flesh with violent twists and turns. Silvertip sharks have been observed swimming around the periphery of groups of feeding sharks of other species, occasionally dashing in to steal food. This species often approaches ships, as they are attracted to certain artificial, low-frequency sounds.|$|E
50|$|The longheaded <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> (Aetobatus flagellum) is {{a species}} of <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> in the family Myliobatidae. It {{is found in the}} {{tropical}} Indian Ocean off Pakistan, India and Indonesia. It formerly included populations in the northwest Pacific, but these were recognized as a separate species, Aetobatus narutobiei, in 2013. The longheaded <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> is found in coastal habitats and regularly in brackish water. It is a relatively small <b>eagle</b> <b>ray,</b> reaching up to 47 cm in width. It is poorly known, but generally uncommon and considered endangered by the IUCN.|$|R
5000|$|The New Zealand <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> or Australian <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> (Myliobatis tenuicaudatus) is an <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> of {{the family}} Myliobatidae, found in bays, estuaries, and near rocky reefs around New Zealand and {{southern}} Australia on the inner continental shelf. It is a common species and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|R
50|$|The Pacific white-spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> (Aetobatus laticeps) is {{a species}} of {{cartilaginous}} fish in the <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> family Myliobatidae. It {{is found in the}} tropical East Pacific Ocean, ranging from Baja California to northern Peru, including the Gal√°pagos. Until 2014, it was included in the similar spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> (A. narinari), but the two differ in genetics. Following the split, A. narinari is restricted to the Atlantic, while the Indo-Pacific is inhabited by the closely related A. ocellatus.|$|R
5|$|The {{spotted eagle}} ray (Aetobatus narinari) is a {{cartilaginous}} fish of the eagle ray family, Myliobatidae. As traditionally recognized, it is found globally in tropical regions, including the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. Recent authorities have restricted it to the Atlantic (including the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico) with other populations recognized as the ocellated eagle ray (A. ocellatus) and Pacific white-{{spotted eagle ray}} (A. laticeps). Spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>rays</b> are most commonly seen alone, but occasionally swim in groups. They are ovoviviparous, the female retaining the eggs then releasing the young as miniature versions of the parent.|$|E
5|$|Though the pigeye shark {{will take}} prey from {{anywhere}} in the water column, it tends to hunt close to the sea floor. An apex predator, it feeds mainly on teleost fishes such as croakers, flatfishes, and cutlassfishes, {{and to a lesser extent}} on cartilaginous fishes, cephalopods, and decapod crustaceans. It has also been recorded eating gastropods, sea snakes, dolphins, and whale carrion. Other sharks and rays figure much more prominently in the diets of South African pigeye sharks than those from other regions; the types consumed include requiem sharks, catsharks, angel sharks, guitarfishes, stingrays, and <b>eagle</b> <b>rays.</b>|$|E
5|$|An aggressive, {{powerful}} apex predator, the {{silvertip shark}} feeds {{on a wide}} variety of bony fishes, as well as <b>eagle</b> <b>rays,</b> smaller sharks, and cephalopods. This species dominates other requiem sharks of equal size when competing for food, and larger individuals are often heavily scarred from conflicts with others of its species. As with other members of its family, the silvertip shark is viviparous, with females giving birth to one to 11 pups in the summer. Silvertip sharks are regarded as potentially dangerous to humans, as they often approach divers quite closely. This slow-reproducing species is taken by commercial fisheries for its meat, fins, skin, cartilage, and jaws and teeth, which has apparently led to local population declines or extirpations.|$|E

5000|$|Myliobatis longirostris Applegate & Fitch, 1964 (Snouted <b>eagle</b> <b>ray)</b> ...|$|R
5|$|This ray can be {{identified}} by its dark dorsal surface covered in white spots or rings. Near {{the base of the}} ray's relatively long tail, just behind the pelvic fins, are several venomous, barbed stingers. Spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>rays</b> commonly feed on small fish and crustaceans, and will sometimes dig with their snouts to look for food buried in the sand of the sea bed. These rays are commonly observed leaping out of the water, and on at least two occasions have been reported as having jumped into boats, in one incident resulting in the death of a woman in the Florida Keys. The spotted eagle ray is hunted by a wide variety of sharks. The rays are considered near threatened on the IUCN Red List. They are fished mainly in Southeast Asia and Africa, the most common market being in commercial trade and aquariums. They are protected in the Great Barrier Reef.|$|E
5|$|Vision {{seems to}} be more {{important}} to the pelagic ray in finding food than in other stingrays. Compared to other members of its family, this species has less than one-third the density of electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini on its underside. The ampullae also cover a smaller area, though not as small as in <b>eagle</b> <b>rays,</b> and are more evenly distributed between the ventral and dorsal surfaces. This ray can detect an electric field of well under 1 nV/cm at a distance of up to , and may be able to pick up the minute electric fields produced by moving sea water. The lateral line of the pelagic stingray, a complex system of mechanoreceptors that detect nearby movement and ocean currents, remains similar to other stingrays in covering a greater area on the ventral than the dorsal surface. However, this species is less responsive to mechanical than to visual stimuli.|$|E
25|$|Stingrays are a {{group of}} rays, which are {{cartilaginous}} fish related to sharks. They are classified in the suborder Myliobatoidei of the order Myliobatiformes and consist of eight families: Hexatrygonidae (sixgill stingray), Plesiobatidae (deepwater stingray), Urolophidae (stingarees), Urotrygonidae (round rays), Dasyatidae (whiptail stingrays), Potamotrygonidae (river stingrays), Gymnuridae (butterfly rays), and Myliobatidae (<b>eagle</b> <b>rays).</b>|$|E

5000|$|Aetobatus {{flagellum}} (Bloch & J. G. Schneider, 1801) (Long-headed <b>eagle</b> <b>ray)</b> ...|$|R
25|$|Stingrays {{are common}} in coastal {{tropical}} and subtropical marine waters throughout the world. Some species, such as Dasyatis thetidis, are found in warmer temperate oceans, and others, such as Plesiobatis daviesi, {{are found in the}} deep ocean. The river stingrays, and a number of whiptail stingrays (such as the Niger stingray), are restricted to fresh water. Most myliobatoids are demersal (inhabiting the next-to-lowest zone in the water column), but some, such as the pelagic stingray and the <b>eagle</b> <b>rays,</b> are pelagic.|$|E

50|$|Aetobatus narutobiei, the Naru <b>eagle</b> <b>ray,</b> is {{a species}} of {{cartilaginous}} fish of the <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> family, Myliobatidae. It {{is found in the}} northwest Pacific off south Japan, South Korea, China, Hong Kong and Vietnam. It occurs from shallow, coastal flats to a depth of 59 m, but always in water warmer than 15 C.|$|R
500|$|Spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>rays</b> have flat {{disk-shaped}} bodies, {{deep blue}} or black with white spots on {{top with a}} white underbelly, and distinctive flat snouts similar to a duck's bill. Their tails are longer than those of other rays and may have 2‚Äì6 venomous spines, just behind the pelvic fins. The front half of the long and wing-like [...] disk has five small gills in its underside.|$|E
500|$|Manta is an {{attraction}} which encompasses a themed queue and a roller coaster. The queue {{is designed to}} resemble a seaside village decorated with mosaics and artwork inspired by rays. Within the attraction's [...] site are ten aquaria containing [...] of water. Approximately 3,000 animals representing over 60 species are visibleincluding over 300 rays, such as cownose rays and spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>rays.</b> Other creatures on display include sea horses, leafy seadragons and tropical fish.|$|E
500|$|In {{adopting}} a midwater lifestyle, the pelagic stingray exhibits several characteristics {{different from those}} of its bottom-dwelling relatives. While most stingrays propel themselves by undulating their disc margins, this species swims by oscillating (flapping) its pectoral fins in a manner approaching the [...] "underwater flying" [...] employed by <b>eagle</b> <b>rays.</b> Oscillatory fin motions generate lift, thus improving cruising efficiency in open water at a cost to maneuverability. The pelagic stingray is adept at swimming backwards, which may compensate for the lower fine control offered by its swimming mode.|$|E
50|$|The ornate <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> or {{reticulate}} <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> (Aetomylaeus vespertilio) is {{a species}} of fish in the Myliobatidae family.
