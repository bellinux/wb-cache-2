Fiction, you know, is the native region of poetry; and I hope you will pardon my vanity in sending you the bagatelle as a tolerably off-hand jeu-d'esprit. I have several poetic trifles, which I shall gladly leave with Miss Nimmo, or you, if they were worth house room; as there are scarcely two people on earth by whom it would mortify me more to be forgotten, though at the distance of ninescore miles.--I am, Madam, with the highest respect, your very humble servant, ...|$|E

The Churchills might not have a word to say in return; but then, you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through. To him who has, it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence, and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought. He may have as strong a sense of what would be right, as you can have, without being so equal, under particular circumstances, to act up to it." ...|$|E

They have a great sense of humor. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> really fun approach to {{what we are going to}} do with the next Pirates. Very happily and proudly, I have welcomed taking part in the story and working directly with the screenwriter Nathanson—he and I. It's working out really well that way. So I have high hopes for that Pirates 5 because if that's really the last one, which it probably is, I feel that we owe it to the audience who went and saw the films so many times. We'll do it right and end it on a high note.|$|E

5000|$|Following trials with LA Galaxy and Queens Park Rangers, Tuiloma {{signed a}} deal with French side Olympique de Marseille in July 2013. In a 2013 interview, he was {{questioned}} about his journey from relative football obscurity to his eventual move to Marseille. He stated: [...] "I went to QPR and trialed there {{for a week and}} somehow, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> connection with Marseille, because Joey Barton was with Marseille for a little while, so I think that’s where they have the connection… So I went there for a week, trialed, played a game as well, came back and got some good feedback from them, and then a few months later they wanted to sign me. I was over the moon, I was speechless, it was really good news for me". He also admitted that he had little knowledge about the club before signing, stating: [...] "To be honest, I only knew Joey Barton played there, that was pretty much it, I didn’t know much about Marseille or who played for them, I {{had a little bit of}} info there but that was pretty much it". He also admitted that Queens Park Rangers and Wellington Phoenix were also interested in signing him if the Marseille deal fell through.|$|E
40|$|All {{the engines}} were both {{qualification}} and acceptance tested at Marquardt s facilities. After {{we won the}} Apollo Program contract, we went off and built two vacuum test facilities, which simulated altitude continuous firing {{for as long as}} we wanted to run an engine. They would run days and days with the same capability we had on steam ejection. We did all of the testing in both for the qualification and the acceptance test. One of them was a large ball, which was an eighteen-foot diameter sphere, evacuated again with a big steam ejector system {{that could be used for}} system testing; that s where we did the Lunar Excursion Module testing. We put the whole cluster in there and tested the entire cluster at the simulated altitude conditions. The lowest altitude we tested at - typically an acceptance test - was 105, 000 feet simulated altitude. The big ball - because people were interested in what they called goop formation, which is an unburned hydrazine product migrating to cold surfaces on different parts of spacecraft - was built to address those kinds of issues. We ran long-life tests in a simulated space environment with the entire inside of the test cell around the test article, liquid nitrogen cooled, so it could act as getter for any of the exhaust products. That particular facility could pull down to about 350, 000 feet (atmosphere) equivalent altitude, which was pushing pretty close to the thermodynamic triple point of the MMH. It was a good test facility. Those facilities are no longer there. When the guys at Marquardt sold the company to what eventually became part of Aerojet, all those test facilities were cut off at the roots. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> movie studio there at this point. That part of it is truly not recoverable, but it did some excellent high-altitude, space-equivalent testing at the time. Surprisingly, we had very few problems while testing in the San Fernando Valley. In the early 1960 s, nobody had ever seen dinitrogen tetroxide (N 2 O 4), so that wasn't too big a deal. We really did only make small, red clouds. In all the hundreds of thousands of tests and probably well over one million firings that I was around that place for, in all that thirty-something years, we had a total of one serious injury associated with rocket engine testing and propellants. Because we were trying to figure out what propellants would really be good, we tried all of the fun stuff like the carbon tetrafluoride, chlorine pentafluoride, and pure fluorine. The materials knowledge wasn't all that great at the time. On one test, the fluorine we had didn't react well with the copper they were using for tubing, and it managed to cause another unscheduled disassembly of the facility. It was very serious. It's like one of those Korean War stories. The technician happened to be walking past the test facility when it decided to blow itself up. A piece of copper tubing pierced one cheek and came out the other. That was the only serious accident in all of the engines handled in all those years. Now, we did have a problem with the EPA later because they figured out what the brown clouds were about. We built a whole bunch of exhaust mitigation scrubbers to take care of engine testing in the daytime. In general, we operated the big shuttle (RCS) engine, the 870 - pounder at nominal conditions; they scrubbed the effluents pretty well. If you operated that same 870 -pound force engine at a level where you get a lot of excess oxidizer, yeah, there s a brown cloud. But, you know, it doesn't show up well in the dark. They did do some of that. But, that s gone; it was addressed one way or another. RELEASED...|$|E
