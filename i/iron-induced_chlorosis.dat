40|$|The use of {{rootstocks}} tolerant to {{iron deficiency}} represents the best alternative to prevent Fe chlorosis for peach production in calcareous soils. Early detection laboratory screening procedures allow {{the selection of}} new Fe-efficient rootstock genotypes. Seventeen Prunus rootstocks were tested for root ferric chelate reductase (FC-R) enzymatic activity, leaf SPAD values, and field performance. Some rootstocks were used as a reference to compare with new Prunus selections. Micropropagated plants were grown in hydroponic culture with half-strength Hoagland's nutrient solution containing 90 μM Fe(III) -EDTA as a control treatment. Plants were transferred to iron-free fresh solutions for 4 days and were thereafter resupplied with 180 μM Fe(III) -EDTA for 1 or 2 days. In vivo FC-R activity was measured in all treatments, i. e., control, Fe-deficient, and 180 μM Fe(III) -EDTA resupplied plants. The FC-R activity after Fe resupply was higher in Fe-efficient genotypes such as Adesoto PVP, FelinemPVP, GF 677, Krymsk 86 ™, and PAC 9921 - 07 than in the controls. No induction of FC-R activity was found in other genotypes such as Barrier, Cadaman™-AvimagPVP, PAC 9907 - 23, and PAC 9908 - 02. An intermediate response was observed in GarnemPVP, Gisela 5 PVP, Krymsk 1 PVP, Torinel™-Avifel PVP, VSL- 2 ™, and PAC 9904 - 01. According to the induction of FC-R activity after Fe resupply, genotypes were classified as tolerant, moderately tolerant, or nontolerant to <b>iron-induced</b> <b>chlorosis.</b> These results were compared with SPAD values of plants grown under controlled conditions and in the nursery. Rootstocks that show high induction of FC-R activity also showed high or very high SPAD values in the field.
