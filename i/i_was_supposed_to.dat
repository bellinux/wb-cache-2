25|$|In August 2016 the U.S. Navy {{announced}} that it is eliminating the NWU Type I {{in favor of the}} Type III which will completely replace it by 1 October 2019 for wear as the standard working uniform ashore for all Navy personnel. Type III will begin being issued to new navy recruits in October 2017. The Type II will remain restricted to wear by Naval Special Warfare sailors when in desert environments. The Navy's goal of developing a single working uniform for wear aboard ship and ashore and by all ranks and rates which the NWU Type <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> fulfill was never realized by the Type I. Soon after its introduction it was found to be unsuitable for shipboard wear because of its lack of flame resistance and so was banned from wear aboard ship (except for when in port) thus making it essentially a uniform to be worn while ashore only. As a uniform for wear ashore only, a pattern designed to conceal stains aboard ships is not nearly as effective at concealment as a pattern designed to conceal people on land, thus the IIIs are used ashore. The Navy continues to work to develop a new shipboard working uniform.|$|E

He dismissed accusations that Liverpool were boring, rather describing his team as difficult to beat. Owen, the match winner, felt he answered his critics by scoring left-footed: [...] "It's nice to prove people wrong when they say you haven't got a left foot. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be the worst header and the worst player with my left foot in the league, and how could an England player play when they haven't got a left foot....

500|$|When {{asked about}} the casting process, Van Ark explained: [...] "It all {{happened}} so fast.

[...] She later added, [...] "I thought the script was wonderful, and [...] was a great character. But we created her within those two episodes. I remember going to wardrobe and getting a peachy pink waitress uniform, and the shoes. And then I {{was trying to get}} that Texas sound, her all important accent.

500|$|After {{writing his}} 2010 album Airtight's Revenge with themes {{intended}} for male listeners, Bilal wrote A Love Surreal for female listeners with lyrics about love. He described writing the album as a surrealistic exploration of love. He {{was inspired by}} the surrealism of Spanish painter Salvador Dalí, after viewing a 2005 Salvador Dalí exhibit at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. He also drew on the shelving of his unreleased album Love for Sale, which inspired A Love Surreals title. [...] "For the longest <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> sign with [...] and actually put Love for Sale out, but you know, things happen", Bilal told Okayplayer. [...] "It's surreal that I'm right back at the same spot about to put out a record with them. Also, surreal – the word surrealism – my inspiration for this record, I got a lot of concepts from Salvador Dali and the way he made his art pieces, it almost looks three-dimensional, and I wanted to do that with the sound of this album. So this record is almost like a sonic art piece." [...] Bilal had wanted to sign with eOne because of the artistic freedom the label had given fellow recording artist Dwele. The album's title was also inspired by John Coltrane's 1965 album A Love Supreme.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the songs}} for The Beatles were written during a Transcendental Meditation course with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Rishikesh, India, between February and April 1968. The retreat {{involved}} long periods of meditation, conceived by the band as a spiritual respite from all worldly endeavours – a chance, in John Lennon's words, to [...] "get away from everything". Both Lennon and Paul McCartney quickly re-engaged themselves in songwriting, often meeting [...] "clandestinely in the afternoons in each other's rooms" [...] to review their new work. [...] "Regardless of what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be doing," [...] Lennon later recalled, [...] "I did write {{some of my best}} songs there." [...] Author Ian MacDonald said Sgt Pepper was [...] "shaped by LSD", but the Beatles took no drugs with them to India aside from marijuana, and their clear minds helped the group with their songwriting. The stay in Rishikesh proved especially fruitful for George Harrison as a songwriter, coinciding with his re-engagement with the guitar after two years studying the sitar. The musicologist Walter Everett likens Harrison's development as a composer in 1968 to that of Lennon and McCartney five years before, although he notes that Harrison became [...] "privately prolific", given his customary junior status in the group.|$|E
500|$|Playing {{opposite}} Cagney in Maggie the Magnificent was Joan Blondell, {{who starred}} again {{with him a}} few months later in Marie Baumer's new play Penny Arcade. While the critics panned Penny Arcade, they praised Cagney and Blondell. Al Jolson, sensing film potential, bought the rights for $20,000. He then sold the play to Warner Bros., with the stipulation that they cast Cagney and Blondell in the film version. Retitled Sinners' Holiday, the film was released in 1930. Cagney was given a $500-a-week, three-week contract. In the film, he portrays Harry Delano, a tough guy who becomes a killer, but generates sympathy because of his unfortunate upbringing. This role of the sympathetic [...] "bad" [...] guy was a recurring character type for Cagney throughout his career. During filming of Sinners' Holiday, he also demonstrated the stubbornness that characterized his work attitude. He later recalled an argument he had with director John Adolfi about a line: [...] "There was a line in the show where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be crying on my mother's breast... was 'I'm your baby, ain't I?' I refused to say it. Adolfi said 'I'm going to tell Zanuck.' I said 'I don't give a shit what you tell him, I'm not going to say that line.'" [...] They took the line out.|$|E

500|$|Some reviewers {{said that}} the second act of the game, {{taking place in the}} less-structured portion of the old Aperture facilities, may be {{confusing}} to some players. Young wrote that in the second act, the game [...] "cranks up the difficulty level at a speed that may dishearten casual gamers", and said that particularly when traveling between chambers, he had [...] "absolutely no idea where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> head next". [...] Kohler wrote that while the player can explore the abandoned areas of Aperture, [...] "none of it ever does anythingit's just a lot of sterile, duplicated, non-interactive environments". Watters wrote that the loading time between the game's levels, in contrast to earlier Valve games, are [...] "long enough to make you take notice and wish they were shorter". Watters also said that it was unfortunate that the game lacks [...] "stand-alone test chambers and leaderboards...but even so, Portal 2 is not light on content" [...] without these. Welsh {{said that the}} attempt to recapture the spirit of the song [...] "Still Alive" [...] at the end credits of Portal 2 [...] "was a mistake". Video game critic Ben [...] "Yahtzee" [...] Croshaw named it the best game of 2011 in his review show Zero Punctuation. However he wrote in his Extra Punctuation column that, while Portal 2 was a [...] "very good game", it unnecessarily retconned portions of the origin game's story, and did not really further the game's concept. However, this criticism was directed solely at the campaign, and he stated that he found the game's co-op to be [...] "much more appealing and much more within the spirit of the original".|$|E
500|$|Casting for {{the film}} began as soon as Madonna had signed up for it. Griffin Dunne was signed to play the part of Loudon Trott, a lawyer whose job was to help Nikki get on a bus, after she was released. Initially Madonna had thought of asking Penn to play the part of Detective Bellson, but Penn was serving a 60-day jail term, having {{violated}} the probation he received in 1986, for assaulting a friend of Madonna and attacking an extra {{on the set of}} At Close Range. The part went to Robert Swan, followed by the signing of John McMartin, Haviland Morris and Bibi Besch as Trott's father-in-law, fiancée, and mother-in-law [...] respectively. Madonna herself commented that she had a lot in common with the character Nikki. [...] "She's courageous and sweet and funny and misunderstood. But she clears her name in the last, and that's always good to do. I'm continuously doing that with the public. I liked Nikki's tough side and her sweet side. The toughness is only a mask for the vulnerability she feels inside." [...] Madonna was also offered the lead role in the Blake Edwards comedy film Blind Date opposite to Bruce Willis, but she refused it in favor of Slammer. She said, [...] "The thing I had planned to do after Shanghai Surprise was Blind Date at Tri-Star. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> have the approval of the director and the leading man, but they didn't tell me they'd already hired Bruce Willis. That... just didn't work out. But I was really excited about doing a real physical, screwball comedy, so when Jamie brought this up, it was like my reward." [...] Coati Mundi, member of Kid Creole and the Coconuts, and Madonna's long-time friend joined the cast {{to play the role of}} Raoul, Nikki's enemy. Costume designer Deborah Scott was signed to create the wardrobe {{for the film}}. Madonna, who visualized the character of Nikki as a dizzy screwball blond, started watching the screwball comedies of the sixties, especially the work of actors like Cary Grant, Clark Gable, Carole Lombard and Judy Holiday. She asked Scott to create comical rah-rah and ballet tutu skirts for the character, with fishnet tights and loud make-up. Scott also designed a glamorous Monroe-esque dress for the love scene between her and Dunne.|$|E
