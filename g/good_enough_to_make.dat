25|$|Durham won the toss against Leicestershire {{and elected}} to bat first at Grace Road, Leicester. The first day was {{dominated}} by Durham's Australian left-handed opener, Mike Hussey. Hussey may not be <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the Australian Test squad, but he was good to make an undefeated 165 off 290 balls on a flat pitch on the first day. Former England Under-19 batsman Gordon Muchall helped Hussey add 166 for the third-wicket partnership, before being run out for 82. Durham finished day one on 325 for 3.|$|E
25|$|In 28 regular-season games, O'Neal {{averaged}} 12.9 {{points and}} 10.6 rebounds, <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the playoffs. One {{of the reasons}} for the trade was to limit Tim Duncan in the event of a postseason matchup between the Suns and the San Antonio Spurs, especially after the Suns' six-game elimination by the Spurs in the 2007 NBA Playoffs. O'Neal and the Phoenix Suns did face the Spurs in the first round of the playoffs, but they were once again eliminated, in five games. O'Neal averaged 15.2 points, 9.2 rebounds and 1.0 assists per game.|$|E
25|$|The Ducks {{struggled}} {{to start the}} season, going 1–5, but reversed the sluggish start with a sweep of a four-game road trip, winning games in Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and Columbus. The Ducks won eight of nine games from there before adversity struck. Defenseman Francois Beauchemin suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament after taking a slapshot off the ankle {{in a game against}} Nashville. Days later, Brian Burke resigned from his position as general manager, handing over the reigns to right-hand man Bob Murray as the former leave to take the same position with the Toronto Maple Leafs just days later. Young forward Bobby Ryan was then called up to the team from the Iowa Chops, the Ducks' AHL affiliate. Reports indicated Ryan was <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the team out of camp but was sent down only due to salary cap restraints. The Ducks continued to play better, but went only 9–13–2 heading to the All-Star break. Three Anaheim Ducks players, Ryan Getzlaf, Jean-Sebastien Giguere and Scott Niedermayer, were all named starters for the All-Star Game, held in Montreal. The Ducks fortunes, however, did not change much after the break, as the team lost four out of their next six games.|$|E

500|$|Smythe oversaw one of hockey's {{greatest}} dynasties when Toronto won six Stanley Cups in 10 seasons between 1942 and 1951. Hap Day {{coached the}} team to five of those Cups and was assistant general manager for the sixth. He was named in a poll of Canadian sports editors the [...] "most dominating personality in any capacity in sports" [...] for 1949. The Maple Leafs were masters of playoff hockey; their regular-season performances were usually fair to good or just <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the playoffs. Smythe was known for caring little about gaudy regular season records but he did care about winning the Cup, because [...] "winning sells tickets." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1720s Aggie tried {{to sue for}} her freedom. The attempt was unsuccessful, but managed to catch the {{attention}} of Lieutenant Governor William Gooch, {{who presided over the}} trial and believed that Aggie had made a good case of establishing her belief in Christianity. This proved to be beneficial when, in September 1730, she was indicted for stealing goods valued at forty shillings from her owner, Annie or Anne Sullivan. The value of the <b>goods</b> was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it a felony, which was punishable by death during this time period, and Aggie was brought to trial in York County, Virginia.|$|R

However, he stood {{at the top of the}} stairs and decided not to go, eventually deciding to go to architecture school (as his parents wanted) where he met his wife. Kove's inspiration was drawn from the fact that her existence seemed to hinge on that decision, because [...] "if the artist had said, 'Oh, you must paint,' you know, then in all likelihood he would never have met my mother, and, you know, that would have been it for my chances." [...] However, Kove felt the story was too personal, and rewrote it to be fictional.|$|E

500|$|I {{always loved}} going to Ogmore and Southerndown. I thought the cliffs there {{looked like a}} {{building}} anyway. A building capable of withstanding the roughest weather for hundreds of years. The older they get, the better they look. I wondered {{if it would be}} possible to make a building which had the same qualities as these magnificent cliffs. To do that I needed a lot of stone. Normal stone for buildings has to be specially cut into blocks; it takes a long time to make and costs a fortune. But in north Wales the historic slate industry has left behind whole mountains of waste stone that no-one wants. This was stone cut from the mountainside for nearly two hundred years but which wasn't <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> roof slates. Over 90% was thrown away. But it was ideal for making walls like the one I had in mind... —architect Jonathan Adams ...|$|E

60|$|The {{second part}} of the play took place in Alaska, and there was shown a typical mining town and then the {{mountains}}. It was mid-winter and the mountains were covered with snow. The young gold hunter and his partner had discovered several nuggets of <b>good</b> size, <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them rich, and were bound back to the mining camp when the villain and his cronies appeared and robbed them. Then came a fierce snowstorm and a blizzard, and the young gold hunter and his partner were lost on the fields of ice. This was tremendously realistic, and the audience held its breath in suspense, wondering what would happen next.|$|R
500|$|Canadian hockey {{officials}} {{criticized the}} players for the brawl. In 2005, {{the suggestion of}} a reunion for the 1987 team was met with uncomfortable silence and [...] "I don't think so" [...] from Hockey Canada officials. Immediately following the tournament, Canadian officials were seen as trying to distance themselves from the team: [...] "The CAHA (Canadian Amateur Hockey Association) didn't do anything for these kids", reporter Jim Cressman said. [...] "These kids were <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> this team. They gave up their holidays, did their best, risked getting hurt and ended up on the wrong end of a bad decision - and the CAHA basically handed them their tickets." [...] Winnipeg Jets assistant general manager Mike Smith was in the Vienna airport while the Canadian juniors were waiting for their flight, and took the opportunity to criticize them for their play at the tournament as well as the brawl.|$|E
500|$|Pitchfork Media {{added to}} the {{unfavourable}} reviews, stating of will.i.am, [...] "He takes Macca off 'The Girl Is Mine' but decides it can't work without someone sounding like an idiot and steps manfully in himself." [...] The Times stated that whoever {{thought it was a}} good idea for will.i.am to participate in the song ought to be [...] "locked in a windowless cell with nothing but those songs on a continuous loop". PopMatters, however, praised Thriller 25 and the remix of [...] "The Girl Is Mine". They wrote, [...] "Any album <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> you forgive (although maybe not forget) a song as bad as the Paul McCartney duet 'The Girl is Mine' has got to be damn good." [...] They added that will.i.am had put a [...] "breezy spin" [...] on the track and that the song's omission of McCartney did not suffer because of it.|$|E
500|$|Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald {{revealed}} that the film was from [...] "the John Hughes playbook of high-school comedies but lack the heart and insight Hughes invested in his pictures.", but still praised the teenage cast saying [...] "The performances in Bandslam are uniformly strong – <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> you wish this bunch of charismatic, talented kids had been given better material." [...] Time Out reviewer Derek Adams said that Bandslam is far from exceptional, but is saved by decent character development, a cluster of engaging performances and several amusing deadpan moments. Canada's The Globe and Mail reviewer's conclusion follows: [...] "Bandslam offers some nice observational and comedy moments, and director and co-writer Todd Graff deftly deliver the coming-of-age goods for the three main characters." [...] The Daily Telegraphs reviewer Leight Paastch says that the film gives the genre a right old spin thanks to some lively performances and sharp pacing.|$|E

Bullard, who was not a voting member of the FOMC at that time, told financial media that he would have voted against QE3: “I would have voted against it based on the timing.

500|$|Upon first listen, Kirsten Coachman of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer {{said that}} she was [...] "semi-horrified" [...] at the song, but since it was a Max Martin-produced track she [...] "gave it another chance", and commented: [...] "It’s {{definitely}} a Max Martin song. It has a good beat and cheesy, yet catchy lyrics." [...] However, Coachman said that the song should have been sung by Mark Salling (Puck) and Jenna Ushkowitz (Tina) rather than Monteith and Michele. Coachman liked the fact that this song and [...] "Get It Right" [...] fit in with the episode, and wrote, [...] "I think both songs are pretty good anthems, and hopefully they do speak to the audience. She stated, however, that she [...] "probably won’t be singing along to them in my car anytime soon". In an album review giving Glee: The Music, Vol. 5 a total of two out of five stars, Andrew Leahey of Allmusic said that the new Glee songs [...] "aren’t <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> much of a difference". Brett Berk of Vanity Fair gave the song four stars for its lyrics, but said that the tune [...] "sucked".|$|E
500|$|After a {{creative}} spurt in October resulted in new song ideas, Bono {{proposed that the}} group release a double album. The Edge said: [...] "There would have been two records, depending on which songs we decided to finish. There was this one album, the 'blues' album that Bono was talking about, and another, much more 'European', {{which is kind of}} the way I was led." [...] Eno cautioned the group about pursuing the material, telling the Edge: [...] "I know that any one of these new ideas is <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the record, but we have to draw the line somewhere. If we even consider any of them we'll still be here in three months time." [...] U2 relented, shelving the new songs to avoid missing their deadline to complete the album. Recording for The Joshua Tree wrapped up in November 1986. Rough mixes had been created throughout the sessions after each song was recorded to, in Lanois' words, take [...] "snapshots along the way ... because sometimes you go too far". The Edge explained that the arrangement and production of each song was approached individually and that while there was a strong uniform direction, they were prepared to [...] "sacrifice some continuity to get the rewards of following each song to a conclusion".|$|E

500|$|In the {{preliminary}} {{round of the}} 200-meter butterfly, Tarwater turned in the fastest time, acknowledging that nerves {{played a role in}} his fast swim.

[...] "It felt great, but there's still no celebrating for me," [...] he said about the swim. In the finals, Tarwater was exactly tied with Phelps and on world-record pace through the first 50 meters. He stayed near Phelps for 150 meters before fading on the last 50. In the last 25 meters, he was passed by Gil Stovall, who beat his personal best by a second and a half, to finish third. Tarwater also swam a new personal best – 1:54.46 – but it was not <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the Olympic team, missing out by six-tenths of a second. After the race, he briefly considered retiring before deciding to finish the meet. [...] "I don't know what the future is going to bring, but I didn't want to go out knowing I didn't get back up," [...] he said. He finished eighth in the 100-meter butterfly; earlier, he failed to make the finals in the freestyle events.|$|E

[...] Rob Lowman of the Los Angeles Daily News enjoyed the show and Chopra's performance, saying: [...] "Although a bit over-frenetic at times, the series seems to take inspiration from a man-on-the run Hitchcock thriller. Only in Quantico's case it's a woman, and they have a charismatic star in Chopra. I was immediately struck by her dynamic screen presence. So far it’s one of the most-promising new shows, and Chopra is someone worth keeping an eye on." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter, in a lukewarm review, found its pilot [...] "just <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> you watch another." [...] Although TheWrap's Tim Grierson wrote that the show [...] "provides sexy fun", [...] "For a show about highly trained, incredibly intelligent agents, Quantico often succumbs to lame-brained plotting and a less-than-convincing portrayal of its specialized milieu. This new show's fluffy, which doesn’t fit so well with the darker, somber tones meant to be struck by the introduction of a cataclysmic terrorist attack." ...|$|E
500|$|In a mixed review, Vibe magazine's Jason King {{said that}} the album {{occasionally}} [...] "sounds desperate to reach every demographic". Kelefa Sanneh, writing in The New York Times, felt that it missed the harmonies Beyoncé had in Destiny's Child records and that she is more effective [...] "when she's got a posse behind her". Rob Fitzpatrick of NME called it [...] "a cruel glimpse of a talent that occasionally blazes but is frustratingly inconsistent". Uncut called its ballads [...] "self-pitying/self-mythologising", while Q stated, [...] "She has good songs, but no great songs". Los Angeles Times writer Natalie Nichols expressed that it [...] "demonstrates vocal finesse [...] But, especially on the ballads, [...] often drags things out with diva acrobatics". The Guardians Adam Sweeting wrote that [...] "the desperate urge to cover every musical base from dancefloor to soul-ballad {{means that there is}} barely a track here with any distinctive identity or even a tune". In his consumer guide for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau cited [...] "Yes" [...] and [...] "Baby Boy" [...] as the album's highlights and quippedly remarked, [...] "Dangerously in Love ... with her daddy, the bonus cut reveals—as if we didn't know." [...] He gave the album a one-star honorable mention, indicating [...] "a worthy effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well like." [...] In a retrospective review, AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented that [...] "the first half is <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Dangerously in Love one of the best mainstream urban R records released in 2003, and makes a strong case that Beyoncé might be better off fulfilling this destiny instead of reuniting with Destiny".|$|E
