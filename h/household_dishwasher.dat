30|$|A list of {{possible}} sources of exposure to aluminum {{can be found in}} Part I of this report (Exposure to aluminum, release of aluminum, Tolerable Weekly Intake (TWI), toxicological effects of aluminum). Also included there are the release or migration limit values [3] for aluminum of 5.00  mg/kg or 5.00  mg/L food or drink, the tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 1.00 mg aluminum/kg body weight and week [4] as well as the toxicological effects of aluminum. The present Part II deals with the migration of aluminum from drinking bottles and moka pots to beverages. Drinking bottles were tested with tap water, tea made from tea bags, soluble tea drink, and a mixture of apple juice and mineral water. Stove-top moka pots were tested by preparation of coffee as typically performed by consumers and rinsing the pots with water after each use, according to the instructions of the manufacturer. To replicate a worst-case scenario, the moka pots were washed in a <b>household</b> <b>dishwasher</b> after every fifth use, contrary to the recommendation of the manufacturer.|$|E

50|$|Brine is an {{auxiliary}} agent in water softening and water purification systems involving ion exchange technology. The most common example are <b>household</b> <b>dishwashers,</b> utilizing natrium chloride {{in form of}} dishwasher salt. Brine {{is not involved in}} the purification process itself, but used for regeneration of ion-exchange resin on cyclical basis. The water being treated flows through the resin container until the resin is considered exhausted and water is purified to a desired level. Resin is then regenerated by sequentially backwashing the resin bed to remove accumulated solids, flushing removed ions from the resin with a concentrated solution of replacement ions, and rinsing the flushing solution from the resin. After treatment, ion-exchange resin beads saturated with calcium and magnesium ions from the treated water, are regenerated by soaking in brine containing 6-12% NaCl. The sodium ions from brine replace the calcium and magnesium ions on the beads.|$|R
30|$|Before {{preparing}} {{coffee in}} the pots, the aluminum content of the coffee itself was determined. To this end, 1.5  kg ground coffee (3  ×  0.5  kg packets) {{was placed in a}} dry plastic tray that had been rinsed with tap water. The ground coffee was then stirred to homogeneity with a plastic spoon that had also been rinsed with tap water and dried. Care was taken when purchasing the coffee to make certain that all packets had the same batch number. After stirring, three samples of this coffee were removed to be used for determination of aluminum content of the coffee itself. All necessary laboratory equipment was rinsed with tap water before use in order to remove any residual aluminum contamination. Tap water was also used for preparation of the coffee. Thirty liters of tap water were stored in a PE canister with outlet tap that had previously been rinsed with tap water. Coffee was prepared in the aluminum moka pots in exactly the same manner as in the stainless steel pots: 12 -g portions of ground coffee were measured out with an accuracy of two decimal places into the strainer basket of the moka pot. The 150  mL water for brewing was drawn from the canister mentioned above through the outlet tap, measured in a graduated cylinder, and poured into the bottom chamber of the coffee maker. Coffee was prepared a total of six times in a row per moka pot. The brewing time was 7  min for all moka pots heated on an electric plate with a temperature of 270  °C. After brewing was complete, the coffee was left in the collecting chamber of the pots for 5  min before transfer to 250 -mL sample bottles for subsequent analysis. Allowing the coffee to stand before transfer served to let any particulate coffee to settle in the finished drink. Of the original 150  mL, aliquots of 100  mL were poured through a funnel into the sample bottles. This method assured that no residual coffee particles would find their way into the samples. The remaining {{coffee in the}} collection chambers was disposed of and the complete moka pots were rinsed three times each by shaking for 30  s. After the 5 th brewing cycle, the moka pots were washed in a standard <b>household</b> <b>dishwasher</b> for 22  min at 50  °C (normal wash cycle with standard <b>household</b> <b>dishwasher</b> detergent tablets). This treatment is specifically not recommended by the manufacturers of the pots and serves as a worst-case condition. Before the pots were reused, they were also rinsed three times each in tap water by shaking for 30  s in order to remove any residue from the dishwasher detergents and to assure that the conditions were the same as for the other brewing cycles.|$|E
40|$|AbstractMotion {{of water}} inside a <b>household</b> <b>dishwasher</b> has been characterised via Positron Emission Particle Tracking (PEPT). The {{technique}} enables the visualisation {{of the motion}} of a radioactive tracer in three-dimensional and opaque systems. Results showed a periodic sequence of the water over time, encompassing the following steps: movement inside internal equipment and spray arm, ejection via jets, impact over walls and crockery, downfall (either over walls, crockery or free falling) and recirculation of the bulk water {{from the bottom of}} the dishwasher. This sequence was shown to occur within a few seconds and the highest velocities, and therefore, the highest kinetic energies, were found upon ejection. Jet paths were observed to follow a straight line. Increased pump speeds increased velocity ejection profiles, but the effect over the downfall step was negligible. In fully loaded dishwasher (with crockery), the tracer moved slower in these high packing zones, showing low velocity profile areas with higher residence times. Other stagnant areas were found at the edges of the bulk of water remaining at the bottom of the dishwasher. Use of detergent did not seem to affect water motion. Finally, data generated via CFD was compared with equivalent PEPT data, showing good agreement for the spray arm and ejection steps but disagreement in the free falling step. The divergences in the results can be explained by a combination of PEPT data processing and CFD model constraints. Information gathered is helping the development of more sustainable and efficient dishwashing systems...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the shape}} {{behavior}} of complete dentures in household dishwashers was investigated. The ulterior motive {{was to establish}} an improved and simpler method of cleaning dentures in geriatric institutions. For {{the investigation of the}} shape behavior, a method involving digital 3 -D measuring technique was used, which was modified to meet the specific requirements. It was shown that the digital 3 -D measuring technique is suitable for the evaluation of the shape behavior of complete dentures. For the entire test assembly, the average deviation was ± 19 µm. For the investigation, stylized maxillary dentures without tooth arch were fabricated of heat-curing and cold-curing polymer. All denture bases were stored in tap water at 37 °C for three weeks. After that, some dentures of each material group were washed in a common <b>household</b> <b>dishwasher</b> twice a day, in addition to the water storage. The dentures were subject to a total of 81 dishwasher cleaning cycles. Digital data records were collected by means of optical recording of the internal denture aspects prior to the immersion in water and after 23, 26, 40, and 62 days. Additionally, the weight of the dentures was determined each time. The first data record of each denture was used for comparison with each of the corresponding subsequent data records by means of a computer program. The resulting color-coded difference images were evaluated visually and by means of histograms. To asses the movements of the different surface areas, separate histograms were created for four areas of the difference images. The mean deviations of these areas were then statistically evaluated and compared. The movements of the individual elements of the internal aspects were recorded by means of sections of the difference images and vector representation. The dentures that were only stored in water were compared to those that underwent dishwasher cleaning cycles. The dentures stored in water can be considered suitable for incorporation, since the water storage corresponds with the in-vivo situation. The first measurable shape changes occurred on different days in the two material groups, but the changes steadily increased until the last measurement in both material groups. The heat-curing polymer group demonstrated considerably less shape changes than the cold-curing polymer group. In the heat-curing polymer group, {{there was no significant difference}} between the dentures stored in water and those that were subject to additional dishwasher cleaning cycles. As far as the dentures made of cold-curing polymer is concerned, a slightly significant difference between the two subgroups was noticeable. The dentures cleaned in the dishwasher showed more shape changes. This test assembly does not permit a comparison with other studies on shape behavior in general, or on dimensional behavior in particular. The observation that the denture bases extend, however, and the tendency of individual surfaces to change direction correspond with the results of existing studies. The weight development is also congruent with the results of other studies on water absorption. The largest weight increase occurs during the first three weeks. The test samples that were subject to water storage alone continued to absorb water, if only little, until the end of the observation period. The weight of the dentures subject to dishwasher cleaning cycles considerably decreased between the 26 th day and the end of the test, with the dentures made of heat-curing polymer losing more weight than those made of cold-curing polymer. In order to make a reliable statement on the dishwasher stability of dentures, tests involving more than 81 cleaning cycles would have to be conducted. The weight loss indicates that the dentures desiccate. Consequently, changes in flexural strength are to be expected, which should also be investigated...|$|E

40|$|Fast {{increase}} in world population {{partly due to}} improvements in health and economic conditions has brought about the risingdemand for natural resources. This {{is especially true for}} water resources, which bear critical importance for life. In addition topopulation increase, climatic changes with more manifest impacts recently due to global warming caused an {{increase in}} thepressure on water resources. In our country, meeting water demand for domestic use, particular in populated cities, has been aprimary problem for both central and local administrators. Paying attention to saving water shall both help in more efficient use of water resources and decrease the need for newinvestments for water supply. When considered form this point of view, becoming widespread of dishwasher usage in housesshall make important contributions to water saving. In particular new generation dishwashers which spend less energy and waterpresent important advantages for solving the problem of expenses on water. A household with 4 members spends 84 - 126 liters ofwater if it washes its dishes in the sink; the same household uses some 12 liters of water if it uses a dish washer. This means some 26 - 40 tons of saved water for this household in one year. Therefore, usage of dishwashers, beside other water saving devices, has tobecome more widespread in our country. Increasing this ratio shall make important contributions to solving water problem. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyze the ownership of dishwashers, which is among the durable household appliances of whichusage is encouraged as water resources become less able to meet the human needs. This paper is the first study which deals with thedemand for dish washers in economic terms and with econometric estimation method. As a result of the research, observation and evaluations on dishwasher ownership, it has been concluded that the dishwasherdemand of a household can be a function of household income, level of education, dishwasher ownership ratio in the householdsin close environment, and employment status of the housewife. In the research, the education level of the breadwinner was takenas an indicator of the education level of the household. In this paper, the factors which affect <b>dishwasher</b> ownership of <b>households</b> have been examined by using the survey dataapplied to urban areas of Uşak province. In the research, the Linear Probability Model and the Logit Model, which are among thebinary dummy dependent variable models, are used to make econometric estimations. Dependent variable of the model is binaryqualitative variable. If the dependent variable is a qualitative variable which can take two values, which means that if one featureexists or does not exist, the estimation is based on binary choice models. In this study, analysis was based on Linear Probability model, which is a binary choice model, and Logit model. Linear Probability method, which is widely employed in this type ofstudies, suffers from important criticism despite its ease of use. One of the alternative models widely used in this type of studieswhich eliminates these problems is Logit model. Therefore, the function of dishwasher demand in this study is estimated usingthe Logit model which was developed in order to eliminate the problems of Linear Probability model. According to the estimations made using Logit and Linear Probability models, it has been determined that employment of thelady of the household is not a factor which affects dishwasher ownership significantly. Dishwasher ownership in the close familiesand increase in the level of education and income are determined as the significant factors that affect dishwasher ownership. Thefact that dishwasher ownership in the close families is a factor which increases the possibility of dishwasher ownership is anindicator that Relative Income Hypothesis which assumes that consumption patterns are affected by the surrounding socialenvironment is applicable in the urban area of Uşak province. According to relative income hypothesis, it is accepted thatconsumption decisions of consumers are not independent from each other; on the contrary, consumption decisions are affectedby the social environment in which consumers interact. Assuming that education level of the household is among the important factors which affect dishwasher ownershipprobability, three dummy variables were inserted in the model that represents education level. Elementary school graduates wereaccepted as basic class, and secondary school, high school or vocational high school and higher education levels were representedby dummy variables. Other factors constant, education level of a <b>household</b> increases <b>dishwasher</b> ownership probability. The factthat all regression parameters related to education are statistically significant indicates that an increase in the level of education isan important factor which increases dishwasher ownership probability. According to estimation findings, an increase in the levelof education is an important factor which increases dishwasher ownership probability. Employment of housewife in a householdwhich is at any income level increases the dishwasher ownership probability. However, as the coefficient for dummy variable attwo models which shows the status of employment at a paid job for the housewife is statistically insignificant at the level of 5 %, ithas been concluded that employment of housewife at a paid job does not have a considerable impact on dishwasher ownershipprobability...|$|R
