5|$|Volcanic eruptions eject {{large amounts}} of carbon into the air. The carbon is of {{geological}} origin and has no detectable , so the / ratio {{in the vicinity of}} the volcano is depressed relative to surrounding areas. Dormant volcanoes can also emit aged carbon. Plants that photosynthesize this carbon also have lower / ratios: for example, plants on the Greek island of Santorini, near the volcano, have apparent ages of up to a thousand years. These effects are hard to predict– the town of Akrotiri, on Santorini, was destroyed in a volcanic eruption thousands of years ago, but radiocarbon <b>dates</b> <b>for</b> objects recovered from the ruins of the town show surprisingly close agreement with dates derived from other means. If the <b>dates</b> <b>for</b> Akrotiri are confirmed, it would indicate that the volcanic effect in this case was minimal.|$|E
