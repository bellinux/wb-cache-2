5|$|Memories of {{more than}} a score of years of devoted service enhance the sense of {{personal}} loss which Miss LeHand's passing brings. Faithful and painstaking, with charm of manner inspired by tact and kindness of heart, she was utterly selfless in her devotion to duty. Hers was a quiet efficiency, which made her a real genius in <b>getting</b> <b>things</b> done. Her memory will ever be held in affectionate remembrance and appreciation, not only by all the members of our family but by the wide circle of those whose duties brought them into contact with her.|$|E
25|$|In 1893 {{the city}} was rechartered with home rule, which {{restored}} its ability to enact taxes, although the state legislature established a cap rate. Although commission government was retained and enlarged to five commissioners, Democratic politicians regained control from the business elite. The commission form of government was believed effective in <b>getting</b> <b>things</b> done, but it reduced representation of the city's full population.|$|E
40|$|It is a platitude among {{decision}} theorists that agents {{should choose}} their actions {{so as to}} maximize expected value. But exactly how to define expected value is contentious. Evidential decision theory (henceforth EDT), causal decision theory (henceforth CDT), and a theory proposed by Ralph Wedgwood that I will call benchmark theory (BT) all advise agents to maximize different types of expected value. Consequently, their verdicts sometimes conflict. In certain famous cases of conflict-medical Newcomb problems-CDT and BT seem to <b>get</b> <b>things</b> right, while EDT seems to <b>get</b> <b>things</b> wrong. In other cases of conflict, including some recent examples suggested by Egan 2007, EDT and BT seem to <b>get</b> <b>things</b> right, while CDT seems to <b>get</b> <b>things</b> wrong. In still other cases, EDT and CDT seem to <b>get</b> <b>things</b> right, while BT <b>gets</b> <b>things</b> wrong. Full Tex...|$|R

25|$|McCray became {{involved}} in local civics organizations and served on the country school board for one term in 1890. A devastating fire struck Kentland a few years later, and the county placed him in charge of overseeing several projects to rebuilding the town. He gained a reputation for <b>getting</b> <b>things</b> done quickly and cost effectively, and ran for {{a seat on the}} town council the following year. There he successfully advocated the modernization of the town by paving the roads, building an electric plant, installing street lighting, building safer railroad crossings, and several other projects. The tax increases needed to pay for the projects turned out to be too much, and he was voted out of office after one term.|$|E

500|$|In late August 1945 Middleton {{returned}} to LSU and reported to President Hatcher, requesting his old job as comptroller. [...] While still in Europe in May, {{he was very}} busy getting troops {{returned to}} the states. Now at LSU {{he was at the}} other end of the pipeline, <b>getting</b> <b>things</b> ready for thousands of soldiers who would be going back to school. Enrollments had swollen in 1945, but in 1946 the bulge in new students became an avalanche. [...] One of Middleton's priorities was to get housing for all of these new students, many of whom were married. With keen insights into military procurement, he was able to find a variety of types of excess housing units that the military no longer needed, and was able to provide both students and faculty with adequate housing at a very small cost.|$|E

Butler formed a solo project called GZR, and released Plastic Planet in 1995. The album contained the song [...] "Giving Up the Ghost", which was critical of Tony Iommi for carrying on with the Black Sabbath name, with the lyrics: You plagiarised and parodied / the magic of our meaning / a legend in your own mind / left all your friends behind / you can't admit that you're wrong / the spirit is dead and gone ("I heard it's something about me..." [...] said Iommi. [...] "I had the album given to me a while back. I played it once, then somebody else had it, so I haven't really {{paid any attention to}} the lyrics...

500|$|Filming {{began in}} late March 2009, and {{finished}} {{on the end}} of July the same year. Director Martin Wood wanted to film the season in a more graphic novel style. Wood directed both parts of [...] "End of Nights", [...] "Hero", [...] "Next Tuesday" [...] and both parts of [...] "Kali". Brenton Spencer directed [...] "Eulogy", [...] "Pavor Nocturnus" [...] and [...] "Penance". The producers felt that Spencer did [...] "a great job" [...] in making sense on a lot of moves he had to make, as well as understanding that the stories are important in <b>getting</b> <b>things</b> back on track in [...] "Eulogy".

500|$|The next day, {{the family}} convinces them to marry while they're in Sitka. [...] After Margaret realizes how close Andrew's family is, she becomes upset, gets on Andrew's boat, and speeds away with him. She tells him {{she has been}} alone since she was sixteen years old after her parents died and had {{forgotten}} {{what it felt like}} to have a family. She lets go of the helm and stumbles to the back of the boat. Andrew makes a sharp turn to avoid hitting a buoy, and Margaret falls out of the boat. Andrew quickly turns the boat around and saves her because she can't swim. At the wedding ceremony, Margaret confesses the truth about the wedding to the guests, including Gilbertson, who informs her she has twenty-four hours to leave for Canada. Margaret returns to the Paxton home to pack her things. Andrew rushes to their room only to find Margaret has already left, leaving the aforementioned book manuscript with a note of praise and a promise to publish it. Gertrude attempts to comfort Andrew and asks approvingly if he is going to go after her. As he rushes out to find Margaret, another argument arises between him and Joe. Annie fakes a heart attack and convinces them to reconcile before she [...] "passes away". After she succeeds in <b>getting</b> <b>things</b> moving again, she owns up to faking the heart attack as it was the only means to get their attention. Andrew's parents realize he really loves Margaret. He goes to New York and tells Margaret he loves her in front of the entire office staff. They kiss, then go to Gilbertson and inform him they are again engaged, but for real this time. The film ends with Gilbertson asking questions (some of them irrelevant) not only to Andrew and Margaret, but also Joe, Grace, Annie and Ramone.|$|E
500|$|In October 1942 at {{the rank}} of brigadier general, he {{returned}} to India where he organized and commanded the India Air Task Force (IATF) of the Tenth Air Force under General Clayton Bissell. In Bissell's re-organization, five commanders reported to him: Haynes ran the IATF, Chennault ran the CATF, Robert F. Tate ran the India–China Ferry Command, Robert C. Oliver ran the Tenth's service arm and Francis M. Brady operated the large air base at Karachi. Haynes's task force assembled three bomber groups: the 7th BG Heavy, the 51st Fighter Group and the 341st BG (Medium). On paper were more squadrons not yet prepared for war—some had no aircraft, some had too little training and some were bare cadres. Haynes used what few aircraft were available, mostly war-weary medium bombers. The bombing missions often included in their payloads some of the [...] "Compliments of" [...] leaflets as {{a continuation of the}} defiant response to Tokyo Rose. Men under Haynes noted that the general was never flown by others—he always did his own flying. He emphasized operational preparedness and self-motivation, yet his personal style put people at their ease. Sergeant John Boyd observed that Haynes was [...] "not a desk general but a field and operations commander who believed in <b>getting</b> <b>things</b> done." [...] One of the earliest offensive efforts made by the new task force was a multi-stage [...] voyage from the main base at Karachi, through various Chinese airfields with the ultimate goal of attacking the docks of Hong Kong and returning. During this attack, Life journalist Theodore H. White rode in one of the bombers, and wrote a story about the experience for the magazine. On October 25, ten B-25 Mitchells led by Haynes took off on the final leg from an advance airfield at Kunming, accompanied by seven P-40s commanded by Scott. The small force destroyed a transport ship, bombed Hong Kong's vital Kowloon Harbor and claimed 27 enemy aircraft for the loss of one bomber and one fighter. Haynes asked Bissell for more Norden bombsights—the Mitchell mediums shared only two between all the squadrons, and their supplied D-8 bombsights were ones Haynes considered to be of no value.|$|E

[...] On March 7, 1966, Evans got himself elected to AMC's board of directors and [...] "immediately criticized the company's auto line as being too conservative." [...] As sales of automobiles were weak industry-wide during 1966 and AMC was facing major losses, Evans was elected board chairman by AMC's directors on June 6, 1966. He replaced Richard E. Cross, who continued as a director and chairman of the executive committee.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2002, Mayor Anthony A. Williams {{announced}} {{an investigation into}} two assistant chiefs and a deputy chief who also may have been improperly hired by Few. Williams said Assistant Chief Marcus Anderson, Assistant Chief Gary Garland, and Deputy Chief Bruce Cowan falsified their résumés by claiming high-level jobs they did not hold and listing certification and educational credentials they never earned. Few had initially raised department morale in August 2000 by reversing a number of transfers ordered by former interim Fire Chief Kenneth B. Ellerbe (and viewed as punitive by the rank and file). But the hiring of Anderson, Garland, and Cowan deeply undercut morale again. [...] "The people [...] promoted were {{not the kind of}} guys that got things done," [...] one battalion chief said.

2500|$|Explicit {{knowledge}} is the [...] "what" [...] of know-how: knowledge {{such as the}} professional or vocational skills that are recorded in manuals, textbooks, and training courses. Tacit knowledge, on the other hand, is the non-technical [...] "how" [...] of <b>getting</b> <b>things</b> done—what Edward de Bono, the inventor of lateral thinking, calls operacy, or the skill of action, and what Peter Drucker identifies {{in the use of}} the word techne, the Greek for [...] "skill". Much of it is implicit and ambiguous, acquired largely by functional, context-specific experience. Typically existing only in the minds of individuals, tacit {{knowledge is}} normally very difficult to capture, with most organizations depending almost entirely on the explicit knowledge. This makes experiential learning, productivity gains, and competitiveness slow and expensive to acquire. In business terms, tacit knowledge is a passive misnomer for active sharing of knowledge to make an organization more effective. Training programs, for instance, cannot be limited to a source-recipient model, and should leverage mutual exchanges across generations.|$|E

When Cindy helps Darren with planning the wedding they embrace which is witnessed by Nancy which [...] "confirms everything that she thought. To Nancy, it seems that everything her mum is saying is true - that Darren doesn't love her and he has been having an affair". Her portrayer explained that she would have expected Nancy to confront Cindy but Nancy can not [...] "bring herself to do it.

2500|$|Before an SEC record 83,221 fans the Tigers {{get off to}} a slow start, {{leading by}} six points at halftime. [...] "There wasn't panic or anything," [...] said Johnny Robinson. [...] "There was, maybe, a little sense of {{apprehension}} because things weren't going the way they were drawn up. There was an uneasy feeling that we'd better start <b>getting</b> <b>things</b> together—and quickly." [...] Soon after the third quarter began, Fugler intercepted a pass from Richie Petitbon and returned it to the Tulane 30-yard line. From here the Tigers took complete control of the game. Rabb scored on a quarterback keep, and later rushing touchdowns by Robinson and Cannon made the score 27–0 {{at the end of the}} third quarter. The fourth quarter saw LSU take advantage of Tulane's lack of roster depth with multiple long plays. The first was a 55-yard pass from Matherne to Purvis for a touchdown. Later, Robinson returned a punt 47 yards to the goal line, where Cannon ran it in. The final score of the game was a 45-yard touchdown run by Cannon.|$|E
