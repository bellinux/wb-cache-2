40|$|Hemifacial {{hyperplasia}} {{is a rare}} {{congenital malformation}} characterized by noticeable unilateral excess development of hard and soft tissues of the face. Asymmetry in Congenital Hemifacial Hyperplasia (CHH) is usually evident at birth and accentuated {{at the age of}} puberty. The affected side grows exponentially as compared to the unaffected side. Multiple tissue involvement has resulted due to etiological heterogeneity like heredity, chromosomal abnormalities, altered intrauterine environment, and endocrine dysfunctions. As this lesion is rarely seen in our routine clinical practice, we present a case of hemifacial hyperplasia with reported orofacial features that supplement existing clinical knowledge. This paper also adds knowledge to the readers regarding <b>detailed</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>procedures</b> which has complemented our diagnosis. Further emphasis has been placed on periodic approach to its diagnosis and multidisciplinary management following correct diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|Distribution Transformers are {{costly and}} {{critical}} equipments in electricity distribution network. The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has nearly 24, 500 number of distribution transformers installed island wide which {{are connected to}} 11 kV or 33 kV Medium Voltage (MV) networks to meet the present power demand of consumers. Failure of a distribution transformer results to interruption of power supply to the consumers and involve high expenditure in repair or replacement of transformer. Hence protection of distribution transformer is very important. Transformer failure rate of the CEB is nearly 2. 5 % where internationally acceptable level is less than 2 %. When a Distribution Transformer is failed, it is replaced with a new transformer, {{but there is no}} proper method established by the CEB to analyze the cause of failure. A <b>detailed</b> <b>investigation</b> of failed transformer is vital important to understanding the actual failure scenario and prevent further incidents. The objective {{of the study was to}} identify main causes of distribution transformer failures and propose measures to minimize those failures. This thesis presents the CEB distribution substation installation practices and practical situation of distribution substations which would be the causes for failures. <b>Detail</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>procedure</b> for failed transformers was established in order to find out actual cause for each transformer failure. Through the literature review, different failure modes were identified for each transformer component and common transformer failure causes are lightning, short circuit faults in network, aging, overloading, oil leaks, loose connections and bad workmanship. Failed transformers during the year 2011 were inspected in order find the root causes for failures. It was observed that lightning and overloading are the major causes for transformer failures in Southern Province. It was observed that 28 % of transformer failures are due to lightning and 25 % are due to overloading. Onsite investigations were carried out and failed transformers were opened whenever necessary to identify the exact causes for failures. Several tests were done before opening failed transformers such as insulation resistant test, polarization index test, ratio test and LV short circuit test. To minimize transformer failures, several measures were proposed. Maintaining the surge arrestor earth electrode resistance less than 10 Ω, replacing of faulty surge arrestors, installation of LV surge arrestors, proper fuse selection, balancing of loads, and proper crimping of lugs are few recommendations. It is strictly recommended to train the field staff to follow the CEB construction standards of distribution substations when constructing as well as doing operation and maintenance works...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE — The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to accurately determine the incidence of lower-extremity amputation using prospective data collection and to compare the results with those obtained by retrospective methods. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — The study was carried out over a 3 -year period in a large district general hospital covering a clearly defined and relatively static popula-tion. All diabetic inpatients with foot problems were identified and followed-up until discharge or death. The demographic and admission <b>details,</b> medical history, <b>investigations,</b> <b>procedures,</b> and history and etiology of the foot lesion were collected twice weekly by a specialist nurse and podiatrist from all relevant wards. Thus, all subjects who underwent amputation could be identified. For comparison, retrospective data were collected from the hospital coding activities database, operating theater log books, anesthetic database, and limb-fitting records. RESULTS — The total population of the region in 2000 was 337, 859, of which 9, 183 were known to have diabetes. The total number of amputations during the 3 -year survey period was 79, of which 45 were major and 34 minor. In our local population, the mean incidence during the survey period (1997 – 2000) equates to 7. 8 / 100, 000 general population and 2. 85 / 1, 00...|$|R
