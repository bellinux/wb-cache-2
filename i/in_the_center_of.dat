40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose that the {{compressive}} tidal field <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> flat-core early type galaxies and ultraluminous galaxies compresses molecular clouds producing dense gas obseved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> these galaxies. <b>The</b> effect of galactic tidal fields is usually considered disruptive <b>in</b> <b>the</b> literature. However, for some galaxies, the mass profile flattens towards <b>the</b> <b>center</b> and <b>the</b> resulting galactic tidal field is not disruptive but instead it is compressive within the flat-core region. We have used the virial theorem to determine the minimum density of a molecular cloud to be stable and gravitationally bound within the tidally compressive region of a galaxy. We have applied the mechanism to determine the mean molecular cloud densities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> a sample of flat-core, early-type galaxies and ultraluminous galaxies.
