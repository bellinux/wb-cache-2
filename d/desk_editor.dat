2500|$|During {{the first}} week of May 2005, Maureen O'Gara, writing in Linux World, wrote an exposé {{claiming}} to unmask Jones. Two weeks before O'Gara's publication, McBride said that SCO was investigating Jones' identity. [...] The article included alleged, but unverified, personal information about Jones, including a photo of Jones' supposed house and purported addresses and telephone numbers for Jones and her mother. After a flood of complaints to the publisher, lobbying of the site's advertisers, and claims of a denial-of-service attack launched against the Sys-Con domain, Linux Business News publisher Sys-Con issued a public apology, and said they dropped O'Gara and her LinuxGram column. Despite this assertion, O'Gara remained with Sys-Con; as of 2009, she is the Virtualization News <b>Desk</b> <b>editor</b> at Sys-Con Media, who describe her as [...] "ne of the most respected technology reporters in the business" [...] and has her work published in multiple magazines owned by Sys-Con Media.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the norms of news transediting, a {{combination}} of translating and editing news source material according to journalistic practices for the consumption of the target audience. The aims of the study are to analyse how prominent norms affect news transediting and to identify potential general qualities of the field. Norms are studied based on Toury’s theory and categories of translational norms through an analysis of semi-structured interviews with foreign <b>desk</b> <b>editors</b> of Yle Uutiset, a Finnish news agency. Although various elements of the news text are transedited according to different norms, the analysis confirms previous claims that news transediting norms are overall heavily target-audience-oriented. Contrary to the original hypothesis, news transediting appears less standardized than previous studies suggest and shows more independence and less normative restrictions than monolingual news production. Translation was also found to result in generalization {{and the use of}} neutral language especially in the context of sensitive issues...|$|R
