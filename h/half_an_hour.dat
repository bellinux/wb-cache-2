5|$|Inside No. 9 is an {{anthology}} series, with each episode featuring a new story, {{with a new}} setting and new characters. Episodes last around <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> with the self-contained story reaching a conclusion. The stories are linked only {{by the fact that}} each takes place in number 9, be that a mansion, a dressing room or a flat. Every episode stars at least one of Shearsmith or Pemberton, and normally both. Each episode is effectively a short play, and could easily be performed on stage. Most episodes take place in real-time, following <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> {{in the lives of the}} characters.|$|E

5|$|Jardine's batting {{performance}} in 1928 {{was similar to}} that from the previous season. He played 14 matches, scoring 1,133 runs at an average of 87.15. He was successful in high-profile matches, scoring 193 for Gentlemen at the Oval, where the crowd had booed his slow start (at one stage, he took <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> to score two runs) but later cheered him as his last fifty runs were scored in <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> For the same team at Lord's, he scored 86 and 40.

5|$|At 1.15 pm, Parker {{was waiting}} outside the harbour with the reserve {{and raised a}} signal {{ordering}} Nelson to withdraw.

5|$|Black-backed and side-striped jackals, and African golden wolves {{will feed}} {{alongside}} hyenas, though {{they will be}} chased if they approach too closely. Spotted hyenas will sometimes follow jackals and wolves during the gazelle fawning season, as jackals and wolves are effective at tracking and catching young animals. Hyenas do not take to eating wolf flesh readily; four hyenas were reported to take <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> in eating a golden wolf. Overall, the two animals typically ignore each other {{when there is no}} food or young at stake.|$|E
