50|$|The <b>Indo-Pacific</b> <b>{{sailfish}}</b> (Istiophorus platypterus) is a sailfish {{native to}} the Indian and Pacific Oceans. It is dark blue on top, brown-blue laterally, silvery white underbelly; upper jaw elongated {{in the form of}} a spear; first dorsal fin greatly enlarged {{in the form of a}} sail, with many black cones, its front squared off, highest at its midpoint; pelvic fins very narrow, reaching almost to the anus; body covered with embedded scales, blunt at end; lateral line curved above pectoral fin, then straight to base of tail. They have a large and sharp bill, which they use for hunting. They feed on tuna and mackerel, some of the fastest fish in the Ocean. The <b>Indo-pacific</b> <b>sailfish</b> is related to the marlin.|$|E
50|$|Like scombroids (tuna, bonito and mackerel), {{billfish}} {{have both}} {{the ability to}} migrate over long distances, efficiently cruising at slow speeds, {{and the ability to}} generate rapid bursts of speed. These speed bursts can be quite astonishing, and the <b>Indo-Pacific</b> <b>sailfish</b> has been recorded making a burst of 68 miles per hour (110 km/h), nearly top speed for a cheetah and the highest speed ever recorded for a fish.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Indo-Pacific</b> <b>sailfish</b> has a {{prominent}} dorsal fin. Like scombroids and other billfish, they streamline themselves by retracting their dorsal fins into a groove in their body when they swim. The huge dorsal fin, or sail, of the sailfish is kept retracted {{most of the}} time. Sailfish raise them {{if they want to}} herd a school of small fish, and also after periods of high activity, presumably to cool down.|$|E

40|$|Details of {{the biology}} and ecology of species are {{critical}} in understanding population dynamics {{and the impact}} of fisheries on stocks and species in the WCPO. Simple biological information, such as size-at-age, growth rates, mortality rates and movements are required in order to better understand the population dynamics of each species. In addition, these biological data are critical inputs to simple production models and stock assessment models, if such models are to be developed for these species in the future. This paper briefly reviews and describes the fisheries biology and ecology of 19 species commonly captured by industrialised longline and purse-seine fisheries of the WCPO; skipjack tuna, yellowfin tuna, bigeye tuna, albacore tuna, blue marlin, black marlin, striped marlin, shortbill spearfish, <b>Indo-Pacific</b> <b>sailfish,</b> swordfish, wahoo, opah, mahimahi, blue shark, silky shark, oceanic whiteti...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Indo-Pacific</b> <b>sailfish,</b> Istiophorus platypterus, is an epipelagic oceanic species, {{occurring}} as a bycatch in tuna longline fishing. Annual {{production in}} the Indian Ocean is about 2153 t, of which 460 t (21. 4 %) is contributed by the longline fishery in India. Studies of the distribution and biology of the species are very limited. Tuna longline fishing by chartered vessels and the recent resources surveys in Indian seas have generated valuable data on sailfish. Results of longline fishing by chartered vessels in Indian waters indicate that sailfish form 2. 64 % of total catch, with an average CPUE of 17. 16 kg/ 1000 hooks. Season-wise, {{the first and second}} quarters of the year are observed to be more productive, and the spatial distribution pattern shows a general tendency of higher hooking rates near continental borders. Results from resources surveys around Andaman & Nicobar Islands indicate high hooking rates during the third and fourth quarters, with average annual hooking rates of 1. 43 fish/ 1000 hooks (45. 76 kg/ 1000 hooks). The length (lower jaw to fork) ranged from 135 to 245 cm, with two modal classes. The mean weight was observed to be 32 kg. The study indicates that the Indian seas, particularly the Andaman & Nicobar waters, are productive areas for sailfish...|$|E
40|$|Although sailfishes, {{predominantly}} {{represented by}} the <b>Indo-Pacific</b> <b>sailfish</b> Istiophorus platypterus constitute a prominent by-catch component of the tuna fishery of the Indian Ocean, very little effort is expended to estimate status of the stock, their biological characteristics {{and the impact of}} this by-catch fishery on the target species, if any. In India the sailfishes are exclusively the by-catches of tuna fishery as there is no exploitation of the species on commer cial line. The tuna long line survey results in the Indian EEZ shows that tunas, billfishes and sharks are the three major groups of fishes caught on the longline gears. Among billfishes, the sailfish, I platypterus form the major constituent. The information on the abundance indices indicates that the average catch rate obtained from the North West sector of the EEZ is 39. 42 kg/ 1000 hooks representing 15. 58 % of the total longline catches. From the seasonal variation of the catch rates it is observed that the second quarter (April-June) recorded the highest catch rate of 91. 97 kg/ 1000 hooks from this sector. The spawning season of the species is estimated to be protractive one from March-September in the Arabian Sea with peaks in March-April and August- September. The size of the specimens caught ranged from 100 cm to 260 cm (FL) majority being in the length group of 145 - 240 cm. The average weight of individual specimen was 27 kg. The sailfishes are found to feed on cephalopods, bony fishes and crustaceans. The paper portends usefulness of such study extending over greater areas of the ecosystem...|$|E
