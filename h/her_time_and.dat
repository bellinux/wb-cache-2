5|$|Queen Christina of Sweden's {{tendency}} to dress {{as a man}} was well known during <b>her</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> excused because of her noble birth. She was brought up as a male and there was speculation {{at the time that}} she was a hermaphrodite. Even after Christina abdicated the throne in 1654 to avoid marriage, she was known to pursue romantic relationships with women.|$|E
5|$|A year later, Catherine was {{banished from}} court, and her rooms {{were given to}} Anne. Anne was an unusually educated and {{intellectual}} woman for <b>her</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> was keenly absorbed and engaged {{with the ideas of}} the Protestant Reformers, though the extent to which she herself was a committed Protestant is much debated. When Archbishop of Canterbury William Warham died, Anne's influence and the need to find a trustworthy supporter of the annulment had Thomas Cranmer appointed to the vacant position. This was approved by the Pope, unaware of the King's nascent plans for the Church.|$|E

5|$|In 1905 the Heroic Self Sacrifice Memorial Committee had {{suggested}} to Mary Watts that public funds be raised {{to complete the}} memorial, but she objected and promised to complete the 120 tablets at her own cost or provide funds in her will to do so. However, in 1910 she told the Committee that {{she was unable to}} fund the project, as she was devoting <b>her</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> money to the Watts Mortuary Chapel and the Watts Gallery in Compton. Work to fill the three empty rows of the memorial was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 Wong {{was dealt}} {{the most severe}} {{disappointment}} of her career, when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer refused to consider her for the leading role of the Chinese character O-Lan in {{the film version of}} Pearl S. Buck's The Good Earth, choosing instead the white actress Luise Rainer to play the leading role. Wong spent the next year touring China, visiting her family's ancestral village and studying Chinese culture. In the late 1930s, she starred in several B movies for Paramount Pictures, portraying Chinese, and Chinese Americans in a positive light. She paid less attention to her film career during World War II, when she devoted <b>her</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> money to helping the Chinese cause against Japan. Wong returned to the public eye in the 1950s in several television appearances.|$|E

Founding the hermitage as a nunnery is credited to a nun (interpreted as a Dakini) by name Jetsün (or Khachö) Dröldor Wangmo (Rje btsun nam mkha’ spyod sgrol rdor dbang mo). It functioned well as nunnery during <b>her</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> also during the next generation but went into decline thereafter.

5|$|As {{literary}} studies {{developed into a}} discipline {{at the end of}} the nineteenth century, the story of the origins of Romanticism in England emerged along with it; according to this version of literary history, Coleridge and Wordsworth were the dominant poets of the age. This view held sway for almost a century. Even with the advent of feminist criticism in the 1970s, Barbauld still did not receive her due. As Margaret Ezell explains, feminist critics wanted to resurrect a particular kind of woman—one who was angry, one who resisted the gender roles of <b>her</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> one who attempted to create a sisterhood with other women. Barbauld did not easily fit into these categories and it was not until Romanticism and its canon began to be re-examined through a deep reassessment of feminism itself that a picture emerged of the vibrant voice Barbauld had been.|$|E
5|$|Disliking Royal Doulton's tiling designs, {{and with}} <b>her</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> money {{increasingly}} {{devoted to the}} maintenance of the Watts Gallery, Mary Watts by now was losing interest in the memorial and by 1930 had handed complete control to the Heroic Self Sacrifice Memorial Committee. Neither Mary Watts nor the Committee had added new names to the list originally proposed by Watts, and thus there were no proposed names more recent than 1904, with the vast majority dating back to the 19th century. The Committee decided that rather than use these by now dated records, they would request suggestions from relevant public bodies. The British Medical Association was asked to suggest brave medical professionals, the Metropolitan Police Service to suggest brave police officers, and, in light of the park's name, the General Post Office was asked to suggest heroic postal workers. The Metropolitan Police suggested the names of three officers who had died while rescuing others, and on 15 October 1930 tablets to the three officers, manufactured by Royal Doulton to a similar design to their previous tablets, were added to the second row and unveiled by Hastings Lees-Smith, the Postmaster-General, in a ceremony also commemorating the 50th anniversary of the opening of the park, attended by Mary Watts and many police officers and relatives of those being commemorated.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, {{the park}} became the {{location}} for George Frederic Watts's Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice, {{a memorial to}} ordinary people who died while saving {{the lives of others}} and who might otherwise be forgotten, {{in the form of a}} loggia and long wall housing ceramic memorial tablets. Only four of the planned 120 memorial tablets were in place at the time of its opening, with a further nine tablets added during Watts's lifetime. Watts's wife, Mary Watts, took over the management of the project after Watts's death in 1904 and oversaw the installation of a further 35 memorial tablets in the following four years along with a small monument to Watts. Later she became disillusioned with the new tile manufacturer and, with <b>her</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> money increasingly occupied by the running of the Watts Gallery, she lost interest in the project, and only five further tablets were added during her lifetime.|$|E

5|$|Stone {{viewed the}} {{tradition}} of wives abandoning their own surname to assume that of their husbands {{as a manifestation of}} the legal annihilation of a married woman’s identity. Immediately after her marriage, with the agreement of her husband, she continued to sign correspondence as “Lucy Stone” or “Lucy Stone – only.” But during the summer, Blackwell tried to register the deed for property Stone purchased in Wisconsin, and the registrar insisted she sign it as “Lucy Stone Blackwell.” The couple consulted Blackwell’s friend, Salmon P. Chase, a Cincinnati lawyer and future Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, who was not immediately able to answer their question about the legality of her name. So while continuing to sign her name as Lucy Stone in private correspondence, for eight months she signed her name as Lucy Stone Blackwell on public documents and allowed herself to be so identified in convention proceedings and newspaper reports. But upon receiving assurance from Chase that no law required a married woman to change her name, Stone made a public announcement at the May 7, 1856, convention of the American Anti-Slavery Society in Boston that her name remained Lucy Stone. In 1879, when Boston women were granted the franchise in school elections, Stone registered to vote. But officials notified her that she {{would not be allowed to}} vote unless she added “Blackwell” to her signature. This she refused to do, and because <b>her</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> energy were consumed with suffrage work, she did not challenge the action in a court of law.|$|E
