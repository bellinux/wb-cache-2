Carter {{said of the}} episode: The Erlenmeyer Flask' brings back nothing but good memories. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> terrific images in it; it really brought the series {{in its first year}} full circle. It was successful in doing what we wanted to do, which was to close down the X-Files. It shocked a lot of people". Goodwin commented: [...] "Everything about that episode is absolutely first class. The acting, the art direction, the camera work. There's nothing in it that isn't the best you can get, and that's really a credit to a lot of very talented people". The episode introduced many concepts and themes that would appear in the mythology episodes for the show throughout the years including genetic experiments, alien-human hybrids, toxic alien blood, government conspiracies, alien fetuses and deadly assassins.|$|E
500|$|In April 1997, {{the band}} convened at Buck's Kauai {{vacation}} home to record demos of material {{intended for the}} next album. The band sought to reinvent its sound and intended to incorporate drum loops and percussion experiments. Just as the sessions were due to begin in October, Berry decided, after months of contemplation and discussions with Downs and Mills, to tell {{the rest of the}} band that he was quitting. Berry told his bandmates that he would not quit if they would break up as a result, so Stipe, Buck, and Mills agreed to carry on as a three-piece with his blessing. Berry publicly announced his departure three weeks later in October 1997. Berry told the press, [...] "I'm just not as enthusiastic as I {{have been in the past}} about doing this anymore [...] [...] [...] I have the best job in the world. But I'm kind of ready to sit back and reflect and maybe not be a pop star anymore." [...] Stipe admitted that the band would be different without a major contributor: [...] "For me, Mike, and Peter, as R.E.M., are we still R.E.M.? I guess a three-legged dog is still a dog. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> to learn to run differently." ...|$|E
500|$|The Stone Tape remains well-regarded to this day. [...] Roger Fulton, {{writing in}} The Encyclopedia of TV Science Fiction, calls it [...] "arguably the most creepy drama {{ever seen on}} television". The writer and critic Kim Newman regards it as [...] "one of the masterpieces of genre television, an {{authentic}} alliance of mind-stretching science fiction concepts with horror and suspense plot mechanics". Writer and member of The League of Gentlemen, Jeremy Dyson feels that The Stone Tape [...] "strikes a note that it just circumnavigates your intellect and gets you on a much deeper level [...] <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> this impact on you, rather {{like being in the}} room itself. Extraordinary piece of work". [...] Writer Grant Morrison recalled The Stone Tape as [...] "really creepy and very memorable. Just brilliant images. That {{scared the hell out of}} me!". Sergio Angelini, writing for the British Film Institute's Screenonline, has said that [...] "The Stone Tape stands as perhaps his finest single work in the genre". Lez Cooke, in his book British Television Drama: A History, has praised the play as [...] "one of the most imaginative and intelligent examples of the horror genre to appear on British television, a single play to rank alongside the best of Play for Today".|$|E

500|$|Swift {{was very}} fond of Caillat's 2007 debut album, Coco. Swift explained, [...] "When it came out, I {{fell in love with}} the way that she makes music." [...] Swift later {{contacted}} her management and asked if she could write a song with Caillat. They confirmed Caillat would be available due to a then upcoming concert in Nashville, Tennessee and, coincidentally, on the same day, Swift had a vacation day. According to Swift, [...] "Breathe" [...] is about having to depart from a someone, however, not blaming anyone. Swift believed the scenario was one of the most difficult goodbyes, [...] "when it's nobody's fault. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> to end." [...] Swift explained, [...] "It was total therapy because I came in and I was like look, 'One of my best friends, I'm gonna have to not see anymore and it's not gonna be part of what I do. It's the hardest thing to go through. It's crazy listening to the song because you would think it's about a relationship and it's really about losing a friend and having a fallout." [...] Caillat and Swift said one of the beauties of the song was that many people would be able to relate to it because it is never specific as why the departure is occurring or whose fault it was.|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{reconstruction}} was generally considered an architectural triumph, Erith was disappointed. He complained openly {{during and after}} the project that the government had altered his design to save money. Erith described the numbers on the front, intended to be based on historical models, as 'a mess' and 'completely wrong' to a fellow historian. [...] "I am heart broken", he said, [...] "by the result... the whole project has been a frightful waste of money because <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> not been done properly.

When asked about why his recent novels had been shorter, DeLillo replied, [...] "Each book tells me what it wants or what it is, and I'd be perfectly content to write another long novel. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> to happen." [...] While DeLillo is open to the idea of returning to the form of the long novel, the interview also revealed that he currently has no interest in doing as many of his literary contemporaries have done and writing a memoir.

2500|$|One of Radwańska's main {{weaknesses}} is {{her lack}} of power in her serve. Her serve, especially her second serve, is generally slow and vulnerable to attack. Her shots sometimes lack penetration on court, posing little threat to power hitters. [...] "I don't think I can ever serve 200 kilometers per hour, it's just not my body," [...] Radwańska said. [...] "I {{have to do something}} else. I was just born to play like this. I have so many ideas. In your mind it's like, 'OK, I go down the line, then crosscourt, maybe drop shot.' But you have just one second, or even not one second, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> to be automatic." [...] Radwańska merely exhales when she strikes the ball, rather than loudly grunting like many of her peers. She bounces the ball no more than four times before serving. She says she can play with any racket and likes to use one for an entire match, unlike most players, who routinely grab frames with fresh strings.|$|E
2500|$|In a November 2012 {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, series creator Ryan Murphy {{spoke about the}} inspiration for [...] "Dark Cousin", [...] "Well the episode {{is one of my}} favorites because I think <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> great performances and I really love what it's about. I love Franny [...] and she and I were presenting at the Creative Arts Emmys and I said, 'I think I have something really good for you, sort of the opposite of what you did last year.' She and Jessica [...] loved working together. So we came up with this character and I like that she's around in all the individual stories at that pivotal moment of are you going to fight {{or are you going to}} die." [...] He added, [...] "But when we were coming with the idea of it, I was meeting with hair and make up and Lou Eyrich, the costumer, and we at first came up with this idea that she was the black version of Miss Havisham. But I didn't like that. I thought let's do something unexpected. So our inspirations were very bizarre. We took sort of like 1940s, hard-boiled noir women and mixed it with a sort of Comme des Garçons meets Japanese thing. I was very proud of that look and I thought Franny was very yummy. You could see why people would want her to kiss them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jeta Amata, {{who grew}} up in the Niger Delta stated in an {{interview}} that it has been a while since he has wanted to make a film on the Niger Delta. He had written three scripts on it for about eight years; but as the issues kept escalating, it seemed more difficult to make [...] "but I got to the point where I knew <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> to be now". [...] Black November is fiction based on an actual event, the title being derived from the month in which activist Ken Saro-Wiwa was executed in 1995. Amata had once met Saro-Wiwa through his father and was affected by his death. The recent Niger Delta militancy further triggered Amata's interest to make the film; Jeta Amata had to meet with most of the Niger Delta ex-militants such as Asari Dokubo and Boyloaf to listen to their sides of the story. He stated in an interview: [...] "What I'm doing is what they did, but without weapons." [...] Amata explained that even though the film touched some political points, he is more concerned about the human parts of the story, about the feelings of the people and what they passed through: [...] "We are not trying to fight the government, trying to fight the oil companies, no -- we are trying to repair what has been damaged". [...] The film was majorly funded by a Nigerian business magnate, Captain Hosa Wells Okunbo, who says he does not want to go down in history as [...] "just another rich merchant", he wants to give something back to the region that made him wealthy.|$|E
