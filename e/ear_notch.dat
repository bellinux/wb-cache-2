40|$|Abstract Background Bovine viral {{diarrhea}} is a {{contagious disease}} {{of domestic and}} wild ruminants {{and one of the}} most economically important diseases in cattle. Bovine viral diarrhea virus belongs to the genus Pestivirus, within the family Flaviviridae. The identification and elimination of the persistently infected animals from herds is the initial step in the control and eradication programs. It is therefore necessary to have reliable methods for diagnosis of bovine viral diarrhea virus. One of those methods is immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry on formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue is a routine technique in diagnosis of persistently infected cattle from <b>ear</b> <b>notch</b> tissue samples. However, such technique is inappropriate due to complicated tissue fixation process and it requires more days for preparation. On the contrary, immunohistochemistry on frozen tissue was usually applied on organs from dead animals. In this paper, for the first time, the imunohistochemistry on frozen <b>ear</b> <b>notch</b> tissue samples was described. Findings Seventeen <b>ear</b> <b>notch</b> tissue samples were obtained during the period 2008 - 2009 from persistently infected cattle. Samples were fixed in liquid nitrogen and stored on - 20 °C until testing. <b>Ear</b> <b>notch</b> tissue samples from all persistently infected cattle showed positive results with good section quality and possibility to determinate type of infected cells. Conclusions Although the number of samples was limited, this study indicated that immunohistochemistry on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue can be successfully replaced with immunohistochemistry on frozen <b>ear</b> <b>notch</b> tissue samples in diagnosis of persistently infected cattle. </p...|$|E
40|$|Research {{aimed at}} {{optimizing}} diagnostic laboratory procedures {{is central to}} the development of effective bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) control programmes. BVDV is a single-stranded RNA virus that crosses the placenta to infect foetuses resulting in reproductive losses due to foetal death or persistently infected (PI) calves that usually die early in life. Persistently infected animals are widely accepted to be the primary reservoir of BVDV and the largest source of BVDV infection. Persistently infected animals that survive calfhood are at risk of developing mucosal disease in later life which is a severe and usually fatal condition. In addition, persistently infected calves that become replacement heifers in the herd may experience significant morphological changes that occur in the ovaries which can result in impaired reproductive performance. This poses important challenges to overall animal/herd health and causes losses to the cattle industry. Long-term storage of bovine <b>ear</b> <b>notch</b> samples from calves persistently infected (PI) with BVDV may affect the ability of diagnostic assays to efficiently detect the virus. This study assessed the effects of 1) long-term storage of formalin-fixed samples at room temperature to detect BVD viral antigen with the aid of immunohistochemistry (IHC), 2 a) long-term storage of fresh <b>ear</b> <b>notch</b> samples kept at - 20 °C, and 2 b) long term storage of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) <b>ear</b> <b>notch</b> supernatant kept at - 20 °C on the ability of an antigen-capture ELISA (AC-ELISA) to detect viral antigen. Previous studies have verified 100 % sensitivity for both AC-ELISA on <b>ear</b> <b>notch</b> supernatant and immunohistochemical testing of ear notches to detect BVDV provided that samples are properly collected and stored. In this study, <b>ear</b> <b>notch</b> samples from seven animals were subjected to prompt formalin fixation and fresh samples to prolonged storage at - 20 °C. Frozen ear notches and <b>ear</b> <b>notch</b> supernatant yielded positive results on AC-ELISA {{for the duration of the}} study, i. e. 6 months, and OD values remained significantly within range. There was no significant difference between storing fresh <b>ear</b> <b>notch</b> samples and PBS ear-notch supernatant at - 20 °C. However, positive IHC staining on formalin-fixed ear notches started to fade away between day 17 and day 29 when stored at room temperature. We conclude that fresh ear notches could safely be stored at - 20 °C for a period of 6 months for detecting BVD viral antigen at a later stage.

40|$|Suitability of <b>ear</b> <b>notch</b> biopsy (EN) and serum pairs (n= 307) {{collected}} from 10 Holstein dairy herds located in Charlottetown, Canada was evaluated for simultaneous detection, nature of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) infection and genotype {{of the prevailing}} BVDV through Real time RT-PCR. Depending upon vaccination status and age, the sampled animals were categorized into two groups, A (n= 123, ≤ 6 month of age) and B (n= 184, ≥ 6 months of age) originating from 4 vaccinated (n= 108) and 3 non-vaccinated (n= 76) animal herds. On first round of testing a discrepancy between <b>ear</b> <b>notch</b> biopsies and sera pairs (3. 25 and 6. 50 %; P< 0. 05) of groups A was observed, however, a complete harmony (50 % for EN and sera each, P< 0. 01 was found on second round of testing that confirmed the presence of 4 persistent infection (PI) animals harboring genotype 1 of BVDV. Complete concordance between EN and sera pairs (P< 0. 01) on first and follow up testing in group B was observed (2. 77 %, each), depicting 3 PI animals with the same genotype as in group A. In the study, <b>ear</b> <b>notch</b> biopsies did not detect any transient infection (TI) but sera samples detected 3. 25 % transiently infected animals in group A that was 1. 30 % among all the test samples (n= 307) while no TI animal was found in group B. It may be concluded that both the serum and <b>ear</b> <b>notch</b> biopsy {{can be used to}} detect PI animals and that, serum samples are more sensitive than <b>ear</b> <b>notch</b> (P < 0. 05) for detection of TI using real time RT-PCR...|$|E

In order to test this hypothesis, <b>ear</b> <b>notch</b> samples from 7 animals were divided into 2 groups.

40|$|Bovine Viral Diarrhea is an {{extremely}} contagious beef cattle virus and costly disease to the beef industry. BVD results in respiratory or digestive disease, weight loss, abortions, and production loss. BVD also weakens the immune response enabling other diseases {{to have a greater}} impact on the infected animal (Bagley et al,. 2007). Standard BVD testing practices require taking an <b>ear</b> <b>notch</b> or serum sample, refrigeration and proper storage of the sample, and sending samples to a laboratory to be analyzed.

40|$|Infection due to bovine viral {{diarrhoea}} virus (BVDV) is endemic in most cattle-producing countries {{throughout the}} world. The key elements of a BVDV control programme are biosecurity, elimination of persistently infected animals and surveillance. Bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) is a notifiable disease in Belgium and an official eradication programme started from January 2015, based on testing ear notches sampled during the official identification and registration of calves at birth. An antigen-capture ELISA test based on the detection of BVDV Erns protein is used. <b>Ear</b> <b>notch</b> sample may {{also be used to}} characterize the genotype of the calf when appropriate elution/dilution buffer is added. Both BVDV antigen-ELISA analysis and animal traceability could be performed. With regards to the reference protocol used in the preparation of <b>ear</b> <b>notch</b> samples, alternative procedures were tested in terms of BVDV analytic sensitivity, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, as well as quality and purity of animal DNA. The Allflex DNA Buffer D showed promising results in BVDV diagnosis and genome analyses, opening new perspectives for the livestock industry by the exploitation of the animal genome. Due to the high number of cattle involved in the Belgian official BVDV eradication programme based on <b>ear</b> <b>notch</b> tags sample, a large database on both BVDV status of newborn calves and cattle genome could be created for subsequent different uses (e. g. traceability, determination of parentage, genetic signatures throughout the genome associated with particular traits) evolving through a more integrated animal health...|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} to pain, mice may vocalize at frequencies above {{the range of}} human hearing (greater than 20 kHz). To determine whether an ultrasonic recording system is a reliable tool for assessing acute pain, we measured audible and ultrasonic vocalization in mice subjected to either nonpainful or potentially painful procedures performed routinely in animal facilities. Data were collected from 109 weanling mice (Mus musculus; B 6, 129 S 6 -Stab 5 b) scheduled for 2 potentially painful procedures: DNA testing by tail snip and identification by ear notching. The mice each were assigned randomly to 1 of 4 groups: 1) actual tail snip, 2) sham tail snip, 3) actual <b>ear</b> <b>notch,</b> or 4) sham <b>ear</b> <b>notch.</b> Vocalizations during the treatments were recorded with an ultrasonic recorder. Most mice (65 %; n = 55) demonstrated no vocal {{response to}} the potentially painful procedures. More mice that received actual tail snips produced audible sounds (11 of 29 mice) than did those that underwent sham tail snips (0 of 30 mice). In addition, audible vocalizations occurred more frequently during <b>ear</b> <b>notch</b> procedures (8 of 26 mice) than during sham ear-notch manipulations (2 of 24 mice). For all 20 of the mice that produced ultrasonic vocalizations, these calls were accompanied by simultaneous audible components. We conclude that ultrasonic vocalizations do not provide any more information than do audible vocalizations for assessing responses to potentially painful procedures. In addition, because many mice made no sound at all after a potentially painful stimulus, vocalizations generally are not good metrics of acute pain in laboratory mice. Alternatively, the lack of vocalizations {{in many of the}} mice may suggest that tail snipping and ear notching are not particularly painful procedures for most of these mice...|$|E

The samples included clotted blood for serum, nasal swabs, and fresh and formalin-fixed <b>ear</b> <b>notches.</b> The tests were as follows: titration of infectious virus in serum and nasal swabs; antigen-capture (AC) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or ACE, on serum, nasal swabs, and fresh ear notches; gel-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of serum, nasal swabs, and fresh ear notches; immunohistochemical (IHC) testing of formalin-fixed ear notches; and serologic testing for BVDV antibodies in serum. Of the 12 animals starting the study, 3 died with mucosal disease. The ACE and IHC tests on <b>ear</b> <b>notches</b> had positive results throughout the study, as did the ACE and PCR tests on serum. There was detectable virus in nasal swabs from all the cattle throughout the study {{except for a few}} samples that were toxic to cell cultures.

The BVDV antibodies were due to vaccination or exposure to heterologous strains and did not appear to interfere with any BVDV test. These findings illustrate that PI cattle may be identified by several tests, but differentiation of PI cattle from cattle with acute BVDV infection requires additional testing, especially of blood samples and nasal swabs positive on initial testing.

Here, colostrum-deprived calves persistently infected with HoBi-like pestivirus (HoBi-like PI calves) were generated and sampled (serum, buffy coat, and ear notches) {{on the day of}} birth (DOB) and weekly for 5 consecutive weeks. The samples were subjected to diagnostic tests for BVDV [...] two reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assays, two commercial real-time RT quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), two antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ACE), and immunohistochemistry (IHC) [...] and to HoBi-like virus-specific RT-PCR and RT-qPCR assays. The rate of false negatives varied among the calves. The HoBi-like virus-specific RT-PCR detected HoBi-like virus in 83 %, 75 %, and 87 % of the serum, buffy coat, and <b>ear</b> <b>notch</b> samples, respectively, while the HoBi-like RT-qPCR detected the virus in 83 %, 96 %, and 62 %, respectively. In comparison, the BVDV RT-PCR test had a higher rate of false negatives in all tissue types, especially for the <b>ear</b> <b>notch</b> samples (missing detection in at least 68 % of the samples).

There was no clear correlation between persistent infection and respiratory disease. Serum samples were also collected when possible and 10 positive cases were found. Results from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for antigen and antibody performed on these sera correlated well with those from the immunohistochemistry staining method in six cases, but in four cases the animals tested falsely positive owing to nonspecific staining.

40|$|Toe {{clipping}} {{is used as}} {{a method}} of identifying small rodents by using a predetermined numbering code 1 and may simultaneously be used as a method to obtain biopsy tissue for genotyping. It should only be used in pre-weaning rodents. Other methods of rodent identification include cage cards, colored stains, <b>ear</b> <b>notches,</b> punches or tags, tattoos and subcutaneous transponders. Although the “toe clipping ” method of animal identification has been considered to be a painful procedure producing a potentially long term impact on behavior, recently it was reported 2, 3 that toe clipping produces no more acute pain or distress than other commonly used rodent identification procedures when performed on mice from five to seven days of age. These studies also reported no long term effects of this procedure in test batteries evaluating physical and behavioral development. Despite these recent findings, a principal investigator must continue to justify to the Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) that no other methods of identifying the animal are feasible as required by the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals 4. The ACUC must also be satisfied that the procedure will be performed in the most painless and humane way possible and that all accepted veterinary procedures ar...|$|R
40|$|Piglets {{reared in}} swine {{production}} in the USA undergo painful procedures that include castration, tail docking, teeth clipping, and identification with <b>ear</b> <b>notching</b> or tagging. These procedures are usually performed without pain mitigation. The objective of this project was to develop recommendations for pain mitigation in 1 - to 28 -day-old piglets undergoing these procedures. The National Pork Board funded project to develop recommendations for pain mitigation in piglets. Recommendation development followed a defined multi-step process that included an evidence summary and estimates of the efficacies of interventions. The results of a systematic review of the interventions were reported in a companion paper. This manuscript describes the recommendation development process and the final recommendations. Recommendations were developed for three interventions (CO 2 /O 2 general anesthesia, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and lidocaine) for use during castration. The ability to make strong recommendations was limited by low-quality evidence and strong certainty about variation in stakeholder values and preferences. The panel strongly recommended {{against the use of}} a CO 2 /O 2 general anesthesia mixture, weakly recommended for the use of NSAIDs and weakly recommended against the use of lidocaine for pain mitigation during castration of 1 - to 28 -day-old piglets...|$|R
40|$|Early {{detection}} of {{the introduction of}} an infectious livestock disease is of great importance to limit the potential extent of an outbreak. Classical Swine Fever (CSF) often causes non-specific clinical signs, which can take considerable time to be detected. Currently, the disease can be detected by three main routes, that are all triggered by clinical signs. To improve the early {{detection of}} CSF an additional program, based on mortality data, aims to routinely perform PCR tests on <b>ear</b> <b>notch</b> samples from herds with a high(er) mortality. To assess {{the effectiveness of this}} new early detection system, we have developed a stochastic model that describes the virus transmission within a pig herd, the development of disease in infected animals and the different early detection programs. As virus transmission and mortality (by CSF and by other causes) are different for finishing pigs, piglets and sows, a distinction is made between these pig categories. The model is applied to an extensive database that contains all unique pig herds in The Netherlands, their herd sizes and their mortality reports over the CSF-free period 2001 - 2005. Results from the simulations suggest that the new early detection system is not effective in piglet sections, due to the high mortality from non-CSF causes, nor in sow sections, due to the low CSF-mortality. In finishing herds, the model predicts that the new early detection system can improve the detection time by two days, from 38 (27 - 53) days to 36 (24 - 51) days after virus introduction, when assuming a moderately virulent virus strain causing a 50 % CSF mortality. For this result up to 5 <b>ear</b> <b>notch</b> samples per herd from 8 (0 - 13) finishing herds must be tested every workday. Detecting a source herd two days earlier could considerably reduce the number of initially infected herds. However, considering the variation in outcome and the uncertainty in some model assumptions, this two-day gain in detection time is too small to demonstrate a substantial effect of the new early detection system based on mortality data. But when the alertness of herd-owners and veterinarians diminishes during long CSF-free periods, the new early detection system might gain in effectiveness. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|A single-step TaqMan® RT-qPCR was {{developed}} {{for the detection of}} bovine viral diarrhea virus type 1 (BVDV- 1), an important pathogen of cattle worldwide. The assay was based on conserved 5 ’UTR sequences of Italian BVDV- 1 isolates. In order to establish a diagnostic protocol which simplifies sample collection and processing, the assay was tested on a variety of biological specimens collected from persistently infected calves. The samples analyzed included PBMCs, plasma, dry blood, <b>ear</b> <b>notch</b> and hair bulb. Time and costs required for the analysis of each type of specimen were compared. The RT-qPCR, whose lower limit of detection was 100 copies of viral RNA (1 TCID 50), correctly identified all PI animals, irrespective of the type of specimen. The highest copy numbers were obtained from the RNAs extracted from PBMCs, ear notches and hair bulbs. Hair bulb-supernatants directly used as a template allowed identification of all PI animals. In conclusion, based on time and cost evaluation, the most effective and efficient protocol was the one based on the direct analysis of hair bulb-supernatants, avoiding the RNA extraction step...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. September 2010. Major: Veterinary Medicine. Advisors: James E. Collins, Sagar Goyal. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xi, 111 pages. Ill. (some col.) Effective Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) control on dairy farms is multifaceted and includes methods to accurately detect virus, remove BVDV persistently infected (PI) cattle, prevent virus introduction using comprehensive biosecurity plans, and optimize herd immunity through continuous vaccination against BVDV. The {{work in this}} thesis takes into consideration the above means to achieve effective BVDV control more specifically by attempting to: 1) determine the herd infection status by screening newborn calves for precolostral BVDV serum antibodies; 2) eradicate BVDV from a large commercial dairy herd {{through a combination of}} test and removal procedures and biosecurity measures; 3) characterize BVDV in PI calves from the Upper Midwestern United States by nucleic acid sequencing in order to more fully understand the changes that are occurring in the BVDV genome that may affect detection and elimination protocols, and; 4) implement a quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) for quantification of BVDV RNA in a variety of clinical samples obtained from PI cattle. Although many tests have been developed to detect BVDV PI cattle, there are few strategies to detect endemic BVDV infections at the herd level, especially in those herds that routinely administer BVDV vaccines. Many BVDV infections result from direct exposure to BVDV PI cattle. The detection and removal of BVDV PI cattle are essential steps towards reducing virus exposure within the herd and are critical components of national BVDV eradication efforts, such as those in Scandinavia. Veterinary diagnosticians and researchers have developed a variety of accurate tests to detect BVDV PI cattle in dairy herds. For example, screening bulk milk from dairy herds for BVDV by RT-PCR is popular due to the ease of sample collection and the large number of animals that can be screened with one sample. A disadvantage of screening bulk milk is that it will not detect PI cattle in the non-lactating herd nor in youngstock. Alternatively, non-vaccinated sentinel calves can be used to detect BVDV PI exposure in youngstock; however, the sensitivity of sentinel calves in large herds with multiple groups of cattle is not known. Chapter 2 of this thesis investigated a novel screening approach to detect BVDV by screening newborn calves for BVDV serum antibodies prior to colostrum feeding. Newborn calves that are seropositive for BVDV antibody prior to colostrum feeding indicate fetal infection during the last two trimesters of gestation. The number of newborn calves seropositive for BVDV serum antibodies at birth is estimated to be greater than the number of PI calves. Because the number of BVDV seropositive calves is greater than the number of BVDV PI calves fewer calves need to be tested by precolostral serum antibody screening to detect BVDV fetal infections and the probability of one or more PI cattle in the pregnant herd is likely. In addition to requiring fewer test animals, precolostral screening detects infections in lactating, non-lactating, and pregnant youngstock populations and is not confounded by vaccination. Rapid consolidation of the United States dairy industry has resulted in fewer and larger dairy herds. Chapter 3 of this thesis describes the elimination of BVDV PI animals in a large commercial dairy herd with a RT-PCR test. Previous testing in the study herd indicated that approximately 5 % of the calves were born with BVDV precolostral serum antibodies. The birth of BVDV seropositive calves also roughly coincided with an increase in post-partum diseases that failed to respond to proven therapies. The herd owners elected to test all animals for BVDV PI with a serum BVDV RT-PCR test. Accurate detection of BVDV PI cattle is important in all herds, but less than perfect sensitivity and the potential of a false negative result are amplified in large herds with PI cattle. False negative test results would lead to the retention of one or more PI cattle and ultimately the continued persistence of BVDV within the herd. Serum samples from all cattle on the premises, and heifer calves born during the following 9 months, were tested for BVDV by RT-PCR and those determined to be BVDV PI on confirmatory tests were removed from the herd. Whether or not BVDV persisted in, or was eliminated from, this herd was determined by monitoring newborn calf precolostral serum antibodies for BVDV one year after the test and removal of all PI cattle. The chapter describes the detection of BVDV PI cattle, genetic characterization of BVDV isolated from the PI cattle, the detection of BVDV acute infections, and the precolostral monitoring results before and after the removal of PI cattle. Bovine viral diarrhea virus is a single-stranded RNA virus that lacks a proof-reading mechanism resulting in mutations and recombination of the viral genome. Point mutations and recombination of viral RNA can result in novel, unique viruses. Few animal disease laboratories perform nucleic acid sequencing for BVDV, thus changes in the BVDV genome are not well described. The objective of chapter 4 was to successfully sequence a portion of the viral RNA and compare the viral genome sequences of forty PI cattle detected on dairy farms in the Upper Midwestern United States. The 5 ' untranslated region (5 'UTR) region of the BVDV genome contains conserved regions and is commonly used for PCR detection tests. This project described the use of primers targeting 5 'UTR that produce a PCR product for nucleic acid sequence comparisons between vaccine and field strains and allow for differentiation between subgenotypes BVDV 1 a, BVDV 2 a, and BVDV 1 b. Testing many animals for BVDV PI requires appreciable amount of supplies and labor. The <b>ear</b> <b>notch</b> (skin) sample is a convenient tissue for testing and detecting BVDV PI animals because it is an easy sample to collect and requires minimal amounts of supplies and equipment. <b>Ear</b> <b>notch</b> skin samples offer some flexibility because they can be tested for BVDV by immunohistochemistry (IHC), antigen-capture ELISA (ACE), or RT-PCR. Pooling <b>ear</b> <b>notch</b> phosphate buffered saline (PBS) supernatant for RT-PCR is a popular method to screen large numbers of animals at a reduced cost. This method involves soaking the <b>ear</b> <b>notch</b> in a small amount (~ 2 ml) of PBS and then pooling the supernatant. The pooled supernatant is then tested for BVDV by RT-PCR. If the pooled supernatant is positive, the originally submitted samples can be tested individually to determine the PI animal. While ear notches have become the sample of choice for PI testing, there is little information available on the quantity of viral RNA in ear notches and the PBS supernatant that contains the soaking <b>ear</b> <b>notch.</b> The objective outlined in Chapter 6 was to implement a quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) for quantification of BVDV RNA in a variety of clinical samples obtained from PI cattle. Serum, whole blood, nasal swabs and skin samples were collected from PI cattle and analyzed by qRT-PCR. The data derived from qRT -PCR allowed for an estimation of RNA copies in the variety of samples obtained from PI calves. This thesis will give bovine veterinarians, diagnosticians, and researchers additional information on the dynamics and manifestations of BVDV in dairy herds. The precolostral screening method of newborn calves appears feasible and has potential application in commercial dairy herds. The performance and utility of a highly sensitive and specific RT-PCR test was assessed and appeared successful in a large commercial dairy herd. Additionally, nucleic acid sequence analysis of BVDV obtained from PI dairy cattle were compared to PI cattle from other farms and well-described viruses strains listed in GenBank. Quantification of BVDV RNA in clinical samples provided essential information needed to estimate the size of pools and potential variations in detectable RNA from diagnostics samples...|$|E
40|$|In the UK, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that abattoirs are ideal locations to assess the welfare of sheep as most are slaughtered at abattoirs either as finished lambs or cull ewes. Data from abattoirs could provide benchmarks for welfare indicators at a national level, as well as demonstrating how these change over time. Additionally, feedback could be provided to farmers and regulatory authorities to help improve welfare and identify high or low standards for quality assurance or risk-based inspections. A systematic review of the scientific literature was conducted, which identified 48 animal-based indicators of sheep welfare that were categorised by the Five Freedoms. Their validity as measures of welfare and feasibility for use in abattoirs were evaluated as potential measures of prior sheep welfare on the farm of origin, at market, or during transportation to the abattoir. A total of 19 indicators were considered valid, of which nine were considered theoretically feasible for assessing sheep welfare at abattoirs; these were body cleanliness, carcass bruising, diarrhoea, skin lesions, skin irritation, castration, <b>ear</b> <b>notching,</b> tail docking and animals recorded as ‘obviously sick’. Further investigation of these indicators is required to test their reliability and repeatability in abattoirs. Novel welfare indicators are needed to assess short-term hunger and thirst, prior normal behaviour and long-term fear and distress...|$|R

There were five litters born in nest boxes during the study, with an average of two young/litter. Examination of other females during January and February, together with these litters, indicated that all spring litters were born during March. Boxes served either as nesting areas or feeding stations. Nests were composed of shredded bark with a moss base and often filled a box to a depth of 8 or more centimeters. Acorns were the major food item, with sweet-gum balls, immature pine cones, and insects also being utilized.
