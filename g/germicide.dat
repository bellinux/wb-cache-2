Even though these agents are carefully screened for safety and effectiveness, an occasional one which reaches the mass market is found to be a marginal sensitizer that escaped detection in animal tests and limited human panel studies. A guinea pig assay procedure is described which measures the photosensitizing potential of topical <b>germicides.</b> Data are presented relating the photosensitizing and cross photo-sensitizing activities of commercial <b>germicides,</b> viz., bisphenolics, halogenated salicylanilides, and halogenated carbanilides. Tetrachlorosalicylanilide and, to a lesser degree, bithionol are observed to be photosensitizers.

This paper presents data represented by the accompanying graphs bearing on the following questions relating {{to the use of the}} manometric method {{in the evaluation}} of germicides: 1.

60|$|I {{have in my}} hand {{a printed}} and {{published}} account by a doctor of how he tested his remedy for pulmonary tuberculosis, which was to inject a powerful <b>germicide</b> directly into the circulation by stabbing a vein with a syringe. He {{was one of those}} doctors who are able to command public sympathy by saying, quite truly, that when they discovered that the proposed treatment was dangerous, they experimented thenceforth on themselves. In this case the doctor was devoted enough to carry his experiments to the point of running serious risks, and actually making himself very uncomfortable. But he did not begin with himself. His first experiment was on two hospital patients. On receiving a message from the hospital to the effect that these two martyrs to therapeutic science had all but expired in convulsions, he experimented on a rabbit, which instantly dropped dead. It was then, and not until then, that he began to experiment on himself, with the <b>germicide</b> modified in the direction indicated by the experiments made on the two patients and the rabbit. As a good many people countenance vivisection because they fear that if the experiments are not made on rabbits they will be made on themselves, {{it is worth noting that}} in this case, where both rabbits and men were equally available, the men, being, of course, enormously more instructive, and costing nothing, were experimented on first. Once grant the ethics of the vivisectionists and you not only sanction the experiment on the human subject, but make it the first duty of the vivisector. If a guinea pig may be sacrificed for the sake of the very little that can be learnt from it, shall not a man be sacrificed for the sake of the great deal that can be learnt from him? At all events, he is sacrificed, as this typical case shows. I may add (not that it touches the argument) that the doctor, the patients, and the rabbit all suffered in vain, as far as the hoped-for rescue of the race from pulmonary consumption is concerned.|$|E

60|$|The {{smattering of}} science that all--even doctors--pick {{up from the}} {{ordinary}} newspapers nowadays only makes the doctor more dangerous than he used to be. Wise men used to take care to consult doctors qualified before 1860, who were usually contemptuous of or indifferent to the germ theory and bacteriological therapeutics; but now that these veterans have mostly retired or died, we are left {{in the hands of}} the generations which, having heard of microbes much as St. Thomas Aquinas heard of angels, suddenly concluded that the whole art of healing could be summed up in the formula: Find the microbe and kill it. And even that they did not know how to do. The simplest way to kill most microbes is to throw them into an open street or river and let the sun shine on them, which explains the fact that when great cities have recklessly thrown all their sewage into the open river the water has sometimes been cleaner twenty miles below the city than thirty miles above it. But doctors instinctively avoid all facts that are reassuring, and eagerly swallow those that make it a marvel that anyone could possibly survive three days in an atmosphere consisting mainly of countless pathogenic germs. They conceive microbes as immortal until slain by a <b>germicide</b> administered by a duly qualified medical man. All through Europe people are adjured, by public notices and even under legal penalties, not to throw their microbes into the sunshine, but to collect them carefully in a handkerchief; shield the handkerchief from the sun in the darkness and warmth of the pocket; and send it to a laundry to be mixed up with everybody else's handkerchiefs, with results only too familiar to local health authorities.|$|E
6000|$|... to {{wondering}} and admiring {{circles of}} simple listeners, {{and they had}} not yet come to that hour of authorship when it reverted to the peasantry, now turned people, and threw itself upon the people's generous acceptance and recognition for bread and fame. But when that hour came, it brought with it the honor of a reverent and persistent curiosity concerning literature and the literary life, which the philosopher said he was afraid could not survive the actual superabundance of authors and {{the transformation of the}} novelist into the artisan. There seemed, he pursued, a fixed formula for the manufacture of a work of fiction, to be studied and practised like any other. Literature was degraded from an art to a poor sort of science, in the practical application of which thousands were seen prospering; for the immense output of our press represented the industry of hundreds and thousands. A book was concocted, according to a patent recipe, advertised, and sold like any other nostrum, and perhaps the time was already here when it was no longer more creditable {{to be known as the}} author of a popular novel than as the author of a popular medicine, a Pain-killer, a Soothing Syrup, a Vegetable Compound, a Horse Liniment, or a <b>Germicide.</b> Was it possible, he asked, for a reader of the last book selling a hundred thousand copies to stand in the loving or thrilling awe of the author that we used to feel for Longfellow and Tennyson, for Emerson and Carlyle, for Hawthorne and George Eliot, for Irving and Scott, or for any of their great elders or youngers? He repeated that perhaps authorship had worked its worshippers too hard, but there was no doubt that their worship was a genuine devotion. For at least a hundred and fifty years it had been eagerly offered in a full acceptance of the Schiller superstition that at the sharing of the earth the poet, representing authorship, had been so much preoccupied with higher things that he had left the fleshpots and the loaves and fishes to others, and was to be compensated with a share of the divine honors paid to Jove himself. From Goethe to Carlyle, what a long roll of gods, demigods, and demisemigods it was! It might have been bad for the deities, and the philosopher rather thought it was, but burning incense on the different shrines was an excellent thing for the votaries, and kept them out of all sorts of mischiefs, low pleasures, and vain amusements. Whether that was really so or not, the doubt remained whether authorship was not now a creed outworn. Did tender maids and virtuous matrons still cherish the hope of some day meeting their literary idols in the flesh? Did generous youth aspire to see them merely at a distance, and did doting sires teach their children that it was an epoch-making event when a great poet or novelist visited the country; or when they passed afar, did they whip some favored boy, as the father of Benvenuto Cellini whipped him at sight of a salamander in the fire that he might not forget the prodigy? Now that the earth had been divided over again, and the poet in his actual guise of novelist had richly shared in its goods with the farmer, the noble, the merchant, and the abbot, was it necessary or even fair that he should be the guest of heaven? In other words, now that every successful author could keep his automobile, did any one want his autograph? ...|$|E

After a 1 -min contact followed by neutralization (and elution off the carriers), the residual virus in the treated samples was quantified and the amount was compared with that in the saline controls. Antiviral activity was highly dependent on the test method for both viruses and was always greatest in suspension tests and lowest in tissue carrier tests. Results obtained for hydrophilic MS 2 with the porcine tissue carrier were comparable to those from fingerpads, but lipophilic phi 6 was subject to spontaneous inactivation on human skin and proved unsuitable for fingerpad testing. These data indicate that the activities of <b>germicides</b> in tests with nonbiological substrates may overestimate antiviral antiseptic activity on skin surfaces.

40|$|The soaps are in {{many respects}} the most {{interesting}} of all <b>germicides.</b> Some of them, such as the oleate and the bromopalmitate, {{are among the most}} powerful and rapid <b>germicides</b> known. It is possible that certain of the soaps play an important part in the body defence against bacteria (see Flexner's introduction to Lamar, 1911). In at least one disease [...] leprosy [...] a soap has been found to have a specific chemotherapeutic value. The chief interest of the soaps, however, {{lies in the fact that}} they demonstrate to an unusual degree the phenomenon of selective germicidal action; they are, therefor, ideally suited to a study of the effect of chemical structure on such selective action. The selective action of the oleates has been known for some time (Avery, 1918). In previous studies reported by the writer (Eggerth 1926, 1929 a and b) numerous instances have been given in which one soap was highly toxic for one species of bacteria and of low toxicity for a second species, while another soap acted in just the reverse manner on the same two species. One interesting experiment may be recalled here: a mixture was made of four species of bacteria; then by employing four different soaps, any one of the four species could be killed at will without destroying the remaining three (Eggerth, 1929 b). Such a high selective action is unique among <b>germicides.</b> In the hope of extending our knowledge of this interesting phenomenon, the writer has prepared and tested two series of sulfurcontaining soaps: the a-mercapto and the a-disulfo soaps, which are the subject of this paper...|$|R

On the other hand, nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), which are found in the environment, are increasingly being implicated in human disease, especially in the immunocompromised. There is concern about the escalating risk of spread of M. tuberculosis and NTM through the increasing use of semi-critical medical devices such as flexible endoscopes and several cases of iatrogenic infection have already been documented in recent years.

As yet, no ideal agent has been found; we present results in this paper which suggest that Hibitane could be used as an effective prophylactic agent. Hibitane (chlorhexidine) is a 1, 6 -di C 4 -chloro-phenyldiguanido hexane.

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{influence}} of pH {{value on the}} antibacterial action of subtilin A has been demonstrated by survivor counts, inhibition of respiration, and pH gradient plates. Staphylococcus aureus is more sensitive to subtilin as the pH value increases; Eschmichia coli is more sensitive as the pH value decreases. The results are analogous to those obtained by other investigators working with cationic detergents, and {{are consistent with the}} hypothesis that the basic surface-active antibiotics kill bacteria by the same general mechanism as do the quaternary ammonium <b>germicides.</b> A sur-vey of the growth inhibition of other organisms on pH gradient plates indicates that Bacillus cereus behaves like S. aureus, while B. wgaterium, Corpebactem'um poin-settiae, and Streptococcus faecalis behave like E. coli. A pH/rnobility curve for subtilin A, obtained by paper electrophoretic studies, indicates no striking changes in the charge of the molecule over the pH range 4 ~ 9, although the presence of at least one free a-amino group is indicated by inflexion points in the range of pH 6 - 7. The isoelectric point of subtilin A at ionic strength 0. 1 is approximately 6 - 7. The use of sectored, square-shaped Petri dishes for pH-gradient plate studies with <b>germicides</b> is described. The effect of pH value on the germicidal action of cationic detergents is complex: some organisms, including Staphylococcus aurm, are more suscep-tible as the pH value increases, others, including Escherichiu coli, are more sensitive as the pH value decreases (Salton, 1950). No explanation has been offered to account for this behaviour. Since the discovery by Dubos & Hotch-kiss (1942) that tyrocidine shares many of the antibacterial properties of the cationic detergents, a number of surface-active polypeptide antibiotics have been shown to belong to this group of <b>germicides</b> (Newton, 1953; Anderson...|$|R
