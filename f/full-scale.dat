5|$|A <b>full-scale</b> {{replica of}} the Avrocar was {{prepared}} for the 2002 production, Avrocar: Saucer Secrets from the Past. It now resides as an exhibit at the Western Canada Aviation Museum, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.|$|E
5|$|After Georgia {{deported}} four suspected Russian spies in 2006, Russia began a <b>full-scale</b> {{diplomatic and}} economic war against Georgia, {{accompanied by the}} persecution of ethnic Georgians living in Russia.|$|E
5|$|That evening, Confederate Second Corps {{commander}} Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell turned demonstrations {{against the}} Union right flank into <b>full-scale</b> assaults on Culp's Hill and East Cemetery Hill, but both were repulsed.|$|E
5|$|The museum showcases {{artifacts}} from Clinton's two terms {{as president and}} includes <b>full-scale</b> replicas of the Clinton-era Oval Office and Cabinet Room.|$|E
5|$|V-22A : Pre-production <b>full-scale</b> {{development}} aircraft {{used for}} flight testing. These are unofficially considered A-variants after the 1993 redesign.|$|E
5|$|A <b>full-scale</b> mockup of the Q-12 {{was ready}} by 7 December 1962, {{and had already}} {{undergone}} preliminary tests to measure its radar cross-section. Marquardt had also successfully tested the modified RJ-43 in its wind tunnel in the meantime. However, the CIA was not enthusiastic about the Q-12, mostly because the agency was overextended at the time with U-2 missions, getting the A-12 up to speed, and covert operations in Southeast Asia. The Air Force, however, {{was interested in the}} Q-12 as both a reconnaissance platform and a cruise missile, and the CIA finally decided to work with the USAF to develop the new drone. Lockheed was awarded a contract in March 1963 for <b>full-scale</b> development of the Q-12.|$|E
5|$|<b>Full-scale</b> armour trials {{revealed}} serious {{weaknesses in}} the proposed protection scheme. The trials employed the obsolete ironclad , modified with armour protection identical to that used by the s then under construction. The deck and turret roof armour proved to be too thin, and the structure supporting the side armour was {{not strong enough to}} withstand the shock of impact from heavy shells.|$|E
5|$|In {{the evening}} of the third day, the U.S. {{launches}} a <b>full-scale</b> assault on Al-Asad's presidential palace, aware of the SAS warning about the possible nuclear device. As U.S. Navy SEALs invade the palace, the Marines engage Al-Asad's ground forces. The assault, however, ends in catastrophe when the nuclear device suddenly detonates, wiping out most of the city along with everyone in it.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to D-Day, <b>full-scale</b> rehearsals of Operation Peppermint were carried out in order to test the plan and the equipment. Ground and aerial surveys were also carried out to detect the {{presence}} of radioactive substances in troop concentration areas, and at sites in the United Kingdom that had been bombed, but none were detected.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{worked as}} an {{engineer}} in several NASA divisions: the Compressibility Research Division, <b>Full-Scale</b> Research Division, High-Speed Aerodynamics Division, and the Subsonic-Transonic Aerodynamics Division. She ultimately authored or co-authored 12 technical papers for NACA and NASA. She worked to help women and other minorities to advance their careers, including advising them how to study {{in order to qualify}} for promotions.|$|E
5|$|Northrop Grumman Shipyard in Newport News {{constructed}} a <b>full-scale</b> non-seaworthy static replica of Monitor. The replica was {{laid down in}} February 2005 and completed just two months later {{on the grounds of}} the Mariners' Museum. The Monitor National Marine Sanctuary conducts occasional dives on the wreck to monitor and record any changes in its condition and its environment.|$|E
5|$|On 23 and 24 June, {{spontaneous}} mass gatherings {{occurred at}} several {{villages in the}} Gacko and Nevesinje districts. These rallies were prompted by {{the news of the}} German invasion of the Soviet Union, and those attending them voted to fight against the Ustaše. Professor Marko Attila Hoare states that the <b>full-scale</b> uprising resulted from the Ustaše retaliation against attempts of the Serbs of eastern Herzegovina to defend themselves, combined with the launching of the German invasion on 22 June. At dawn on 24 June, the area of Nevesinje descended into <b>full-scale</b> revolt, with around 400 armed rebels engaging the Home Guard garrison. By 24 June, the uprising had reached a massive scale across eastern Herzegovina, with between 1,500 and 3,000 armed rebels in total, including some Montenegrins.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of June 14, while the Lithuanian {{government}} was discussing the ultimatum, Soviet soldiers began actions at the border. They fired shots at a border post near Alytus and killed policeman Aleksas Barauskas. At other points the Soviets interrogated Lithuanian border guards and harassed civilians, hoping to provoke a retaliation that {{would serve as a}} rationale for a <b>full-scale</b> military attack.|$|E
5|$|Scarborough is home {{to several}} local arts organizations. Scarborough Worldwide Film Festival is an annual celebration of {{multicultural}} films held every first week of June. Scarborough Music Theatre, Scarborough Players, and Scarborough Theatre Guild work together under the name Theatre Scarborough. The Scarborough Choral Society performs one <b>full-scale</b> musical and a Christmas concert each year.|$|E
5|$|Since the Southbound refurbishment, all Wimpy outlets {{have closed}} to be {{replaced}} by own brand The Burger Company. It is thought that this is just a 'holding' brand prior to a <b>full-scale</b> refurbishment. Due {{to the success of the}} trial Roadchef have refurbished more sites (including Strensham Northbound) to include The Hot Food Company (Restaurant) and McDonald's.|$|E
5|$|The Moving Picture Company {{created the}} climactic hotel sequence. The fire effects were {{supervised}} by Chris Corbould, and post-production MPC had {{to enhance the}} sequence by making the smoke look closer to the actors, so it would look more dangerous. A <b>full-scale</b> replica of the building's exterior {{was used for the}} exploding part Bond and Camille escape from.|$|E
5|$|The X-10 {{chemical}} separation plant also verified the Bismuth-phosphate process {{that was used}} in the <b>full-scale</b> separation facilities at Hanford. Finally, the reactor and {{chemical separation}} plant provided invaluable experience for engineers, technicians, reactor operators, and safety officials who then moved on to the Hanford site.|$|E
5|$|The {{use of an}} {{aluminium}} {{body was}} controversial, and international experts recommended that the tram company should not choose that solution. The goal was to decrease the weight so the trams could operate with less-powerful motors, giving a lower cost. The first prototype was a <b>full-scale</b> model of a tram, built at Homansbyen Depot in 1935, using an undercarriage from disused horsecars.|$|E
5|$|A naval {{confrontation}} {{took place}} between Russian and Georgian ships on 10 August. According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, the Russian navy sank one Georgian vessel after four Georgian missile boats had attacked the Russian Navy ships {{off the coast of}} Abkhazia. The Russian patrol ship Mirazh was probably responsible for the sinking. The Georgian coast was blockaded by vessels of the Russian Black Sea Fleet on 10 August. The Black Sea Fleet, which participated in the military conflict {{for the first time since}} 1945, had probably departed from Sevastopol before <b>full-scale</b> hostilities between Russia and Georgia began.|$|E
5|$|A secret {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} M. W. Kellogg for engineering studies in July 1941. This included the design and construction of a ten-stage pilot gaseous diffusion plant. On 14 December 1942, the Manhattan District contracted Kellogg to design, build and operate a <b>full-scale</b> production plant. Unusually, the contract did not require any guarantees from Kellogg that it could actually accomplish this task. Because {{the scope of the}} project was not well defined, Kellogg and the Manhattan District agreed to defer any financial details to a later, cost-plus contract, which was executed in April 1944. Kellogg was then paid $2.5 million.|$|E
5|$|After the Omagh bombing, the RIRA {{leadership}} {{were unwilling}} to launch a <b>full-scale</b> campaign in Northern Ireland due {{to the possibility of}} civilians being killed. Instead they decided to launch a series of attacks in England, in particular London, which they hoped would attract disenchanted Provisional IRA members to join the RIRA. On 1 June 2000 a bomb damaged Hammersmith Bridge; a symbolic target for Irish republican paramilitary groups. The bridge had been targeted by the Irish Republican Army on 29 March 1939 as part of its Sabotage Campaign, and by the Provisional IRA on 24 April 1996.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1947, a pageant {{commemorating the}} signing of the Declaration has been held within the roofless remains of the abbey (last <b>full-scale</b> event 2005). This was run by the local Arbroath Abbey Pageant Society, now Arbroath Abbey Timethemes, a {{registered}} charity, and re-enacts the story and history of the signing. The group also spearhead Scotland's Tartan Day celebrations on 6 April in association with Angus Council as well as educational visits to local schools.|$|E
5|$|Binaural is {{the sixth}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band Pearl Jam, released on May 16, 2000 through Epic Records. Following a <b>full-scale</b> tour {{in support of}} its previous album, Yield (1998), Pearl Jam took a short break before reconvening {{toward the end of}} 1999 to begin work on a new album. During the production of the album, the band encountered hindrances such as singer Eddie Vedder's writer's block, and guitarist Mike McCready's entrance into rehabilitation due to an addiction to prescription drugs.|$|E
5|$|Both {{composer}} and librettist were distracted by other projects but Dennis Marks, {{who had moved}} from the BBC to become General Director of ENO, commissioned a <b>full-scale</b> opera to be premiered at the Coliseum. Bryars incorporated material from both By the Vaar and Doctor Ox's Experiment (Epilogue) into the opera. The main development occurred in the period 1994–1996. Bryars and Morrison received guidance and advice from David Pountney, the opera director.|$|E
5|$|By 8 June, Nablus was in <b>full-scale</b> {{rebellion}} as {{were the}} coastal towns of Ramla, Lydda, Jaffa and Acre. At around the same time, rebels from the area of Atlit besieged Haifa and Galilee-based rebels captured Safad and Tiberias in the eastern Galilee, while Bedouins participating in the revolt attacked the Egyptian garrison at al-Karak in Transjordan. In the latter confrontation, 200 Egyptian soldiers were killed. In the rebel attack on Safad on 15 June, {{an unknown number of}} the city's Jewish inhabitants were killed or raped over a period of 33 days.|$|E
5|$|By the 1284 Statute of Rhuddlan, the Principality of Wales was {{incorporated}} into England and was given an administrative system like the English, with counties policed by sheriffs. English law was introduced in criminal cases, though the Welsh were allowed to maintain their own customary laws in some cases of property disputes. After 1277, and increasingly after 1283, Edward embarked on a <b>full-scale</b> project of English settlement of Wales, creating new towns like Flint, Aberystwyth and Rhuddlan. Their new residents were English migrants, with the local Welsh banned from living inside them, and many were protected by extensive walls.|$|E
5|$|By the 4th century BC, the {{military}} formations the Romans had {{inherited from the}} Etruscans were still in use. Though their efficiency was doubtful, they proved effective against Rome's largely local adversaries. When Gauls invaded Etruria in 390 BC, the inhabitants requested help from Rome. The small contingent Rome sent to repel the Gallic invaders provoked a <b>full-scale</b> attack on Rome and the entire Roman army was destroyed at the Battle of the Allia.|$|E
5|$|Captain Blackadder's trench {{receives}} {{a phone call}} from HQ: a <b>full-scale</b> attack has been ordered for the next day at dawn. Realising that this is likely to mean his death, Blackadder plans to escape by pretending to be mad: he puts underpants on his head and sticks pencils in his nostrils. His plan is thwarted when General Melchett arrives to see what is happening and remarks that he shot an entire platoon that used this exact method; Blackadder overhears and narrowly escapes Melchett's punishment by pretending he is relating the story to Baldrick.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{needed a}} {{production}} studio for the film, but recognized the great {{cost of the}} movie, especially during the Great Depression. Cooper helped David Selznick {{get a job at}} RKO Pictures, which was struggling financially. Selznick became the vice president of RKO and asked Cooper to join him in September 1931, although he had only produced 3 films thus far in his career. Cooper began working as an executive assistant at age thirty-eight. He officially pitched the idea for King Kong in December 1931. Shortly after, he began to scope out actors and build <b>full-scale</b> sets, although the screenplay was not yet complete.|$|E
5|$|Development {{started in}} early 2010 {{with the goals}} of {{reworking}} the character Falco Lombardi to mechanically play like he did in Melee and increasing the accessibility of the gameplay style, but the project quickly evolved to a <b>full-scale</b> reworking of Brawl. The game's first demo build was released on February 7, 2011, and development continued until December 1, 2015, when the PMDT announced it would cease further development of Project M. The game has received positive comments from reviewers, amassed a player base of over 500,000, surpassed three million downloads, and been played in many professional tournaments.|$|E
5|$|Following a long {{record of}} instigating {{localised}} conflicts throughout the 1930s, Japan began a <b>full-scale</b> invasion of China on 7 July 1937. On 12 September, the Chinese representative, Wellington Koo, {{appealed to the}} League for international intervention. Western countries were sympathetic to the Chinese in their struggle, particularly in their stubborn defence of Shanghai, {{a city with a}} substantial number of foreigners. The League was unable to provide any practical measures; on 4 October, it turned the case over to the Nine Power Treaty Conference.|$|E
5|$|In 1244, Alexander {{made the}} first of several {{attempts}} by Scottish monarchs to purchase the Hebrides from the Kingdom of Norway. It was following this unsuccessful bid that Hákon sent Eóghan into the Isles in 1249, which in turn led to Eóghan's expulsion from the Scottish-mainland when Alexander launched a <b>full-scale</b> summer invasion into Argyll. Alexander's sudden death in the Hebrides brought an abrupt end to his westward invasion, and {{it was not until the}} 1260s that a Scottish king again attempted to impose his authority into the Isles.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Herman J. Mankiewicz and {{producer}} Sam Jaffe announced {{they were working}} on a picture, to be titled Mad Dog of Europe, which was intended to be a <b>full-scale</b> attack on Hitler. Jaffe had quit his job at RKO Pictures to make the film. Hays summoned the pair to his office and told them to cease production as they were causing needless headaches for the studios. Germany had threatened to seize all the properties of the Hollywood producers in Germany and ban the import of any future American films.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, Waseda University {{initiated}} the WABOT project in 1967, and in 1972 completed the WABOT-1, the world's first <b>full-scale</b> intelligent humanoid robot, or android. Its limb control system {{allowed it to}} walk with the lower limbs, and to grip and transport objects with hands, using tactile sensors. Its vision system allowed it to measure distances and directions to objects using external receptors, artificial eyes and ears. And its conversation system allowed it to communicate with a person in Japanese, with an artificial mouth.|$|E
5|$|In October1977, {{just prior}} to Phase 2 of the XST competition, Lockheed was tasked with {{exploring}} possible operational aircraft. Just a month later, on the day HB1001 was transported to Groom Lake, the Air Force awarded the company a contract under the code name Senior Trend. The Air Force wanted to exploit the revolutionary technologies developed during the Have Blue program. The Tactical Air Command ordered five <b>full-scale</b> development and twenty production aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to developing a}} suitable barrier, the SAM Laboratories also had {{to assist in the}} design of a gaseous separation plant, which became known as K-25. Libby helped with the engineers from Kellex to produce a workable design for a pilot plant. Libby conducted a series of tests that indicated that the Norris-Adler barrier would work, and he remained confident that with an all-out effort, the remaining problems with it could be solved. Although doubts remained, construction work began on the K-25 <b>full-scale</b> production plant in September 1943.|$|E
