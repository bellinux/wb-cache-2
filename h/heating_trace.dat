40|$|This work {{presents}} the results of characterization of as solidified arc-melted Ni–Si and Co–Si alloys. The alloys of different compositions of the constitutions Ni, Co, and Si of purity of 99. 99 % were prepared by arc melting method under argon atmosphere in a water-cooled copper crucible with a non-consumable tungsten electrode and titanium getter. The effects of Si addition to pure Ni and Co on microstructure, microhardness (HV), electrical resistivity (ρ), latent heat of fusion (ΔH) and specific heat change (ΔCp) were investigated. The measurements of microhardness of the samples were performed by using a microhardness test device. The dependence of microhardness on composition (Co) was analyzed. According to these results, it has been found that with increasing the amount of Si the HV increases. Variations of electrical resistivity of the samples with the temperature in the range of 300 – 800 K were also measured by using a standard d. c. four-point probe technique. The ΔH and ΔCp of the same alloys were determined by means of differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) from <b>heating</b> <b>trace</b> during the transformation from solid to liquid...|$|E

The particulate metals were digested under microwave <b>heating.</b> <b>Trace</b> metals were analysed using ICP-MS and validated against CASS- 4 and MESS- 3. The concentration of dissolved and particulate metals were in the range of 0. 002 - 0. 194 µg/L and 45 - 249 µg/g for Cd, 0. 04 - 2. 71 µg/L and 21 - 2885 µg/g for Mn and 0. 03 - 0. 49 µg/L and 10 - 4277 µg/g for Pb respectively. All metals were dominantly in the dissolved phase except Cd which was predominantly in the particulate phase during September 2007. The order of mean log KD found was Cd>Pb>Mn. Positive correlation of log KD with suspended particulate matter were found during both sampling periods except during September 2007, Cd was negatively correlated with suspended particulate matter.

40|$|Carbonaceous chondrites (CCs) {{may have}} been the {{carriers}} of water, volatile and moderately volatile elements to Earth. Investigating the abundances of these elements, their relative volatility, and isotopes of state-change tracer elements such as Zn, and linking these observations to water contents, provide vital information on the processes that govern the abundances and isotopic signatures of these species in CCs and other planetary bodies. Here we report Zn isotopic data for 28 CCs (20 CM, 6 CR, 1 C 2 -ung, and 1 CV 3), as well as trace element data for Zn, In, Sn, Tl, Pb, and Bi in 16 samples (8 CM, 6 CR, 1 C 2 -ung, and 1 CV 3), that display a range of elemental abundances from case-normative to intensely depleted. We use these data, water content data from literature and Zn isotopes to investigate volatile depletions and to discern between closed and open system <b>heating.</b> <b>Trace</b> element data have been used to construct relative volatility scales among the elements for the CM and CR chondrites. From least volatile to most, the scale in CM chondrites is Pb-Sn-Bi-In-Zn-Tl, and for CR chondrites it is Tl-Zn-Sn-Pb-Bi-In. These observations suggest that heated CM and CR chondrites underwent volatile loss under different conditions to one another and to that of the solar nebula, e. g. differing oxygen fugacities. Furthermore, the most water and volatile depleted samples are highly enriched in the heavy isotopes of Zn. Taken together, these lines of evidence strongly indicate that heated CM and CR chondrites incurred open system heating, stripping them of water and volatiles concomitantly, during post-accretionary shock impact(s).

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we deal with}} {{spectral}} invariants for polygons and closed orbisurfaces of constant Gaussian curvature. In each case our method is to study the heat kernel and the asymptotic expansion of the <b>heat</b> <b>trace.</b> First, we investigate hyperbolic polygons, i. e. relatively compact domains in the hyperbolic plane with piecewise geodesic boundary. We compute the asymptotic expansion of the <b>heat</b> <b>trace</b> associated to the Dirichlet Laplacian of any hyperbolic polygon, and we obtain explicit formulas for all heat invariants. Analogous results for Euclidean and spherical polygons were known before. We unify these results and deduce the heat invariants for arbitrary polygons, i. e. for relatively compact domains with piecewise geodesic boundary contained in a complete Riemannian manifold of constant Gaussian curvature. It {{turns out that the}} heat invariants provide much information about a polygon, if the curvature does not vanish. For example, then the multiset of all real angles (i. e. those which are not equal to pi) and the Euler characteristic of a polygon are spectral invariants. Furthermore, we compute the asymptotic expansion of the <b>heat</b> <b>trace</b> for any closed Riemannian orbisurface of constant curvature, and obtain explicit formulas for all heat invariants. If the curvature does not vanish, then it is possible to detect interesting information about the topology and the singular set of an orbisurface from the heat invariants.
