40|$|Background: Risks of {{morbidity}} and mortality may arise when prescription stimulants are used in combination with prescription central nervous system (CNS) <b>depressants.</b> The RI Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) captures all prescriptions for schedule II to IV, as well as information on certain schedule V medications. ^ Objective: This study examines the pattern of using a combination of controlled substance prescription CNS stimulants with CNS <b>depressants</b> in RI. We also seek the predictors of concomitant use of these two drugs classes in patients. ^ Methods: This was a cross-sectional study using de-identified data from the RI PDMP in 2015. We included all patients who filled a prescription for stimulants or CNS <b>depressants.</b> Medications that are not in these two study drug classes were excluded. The outcome of interest was concomitant use of stimulants and CNS <b>depressants,</b> which was defined as patients who filled any stimulants and any <b>depressants</b> with at least 60 days of combined fill and less than 15 days’ gap in filling. Demographic characteristics of patients were used in the statistical analyses to identify the predictors of concomitant use of stimulants and <b>depressants.</b> ^ Results: In the complete RI PDMP data set, there was a total 409, 740 patients who filled 2, 516, 314 prescriptions of schedule II to V medications. The patients using both stimulants and CNS <b>depressants</b> tended to be younger females, which used private pay (cash) more frequently than their male counterparts. Patients in the stimulants and CNS <b>depressants</b> cohort were older women who used commercial pay type at a higher percentage than their counterparts in the stimulants only cohort. A difference existed in the percent of patients that filled an average days’ supply of {{less than or equal to}} 30 days compared with greater than 30 days, between those who take both prescription controlled substance stimulants and <b>depressants</b> chronically compared with those who fill only stimulants. In hypothesis 3, patients in the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder cohort were younger with a lower percentage average daily dose (less than or equal to 25 milligrams) of stimulant, more likely to be of male sex, and use commercial insurance as the primary pay type compared to the usage of stimulants in the stimulants and CNS <b>depressants</b> cohort. ^ Conclusion: The prevalence of chronic concomitant therapy of stimulants with CNS <b>depressants</b> was associated with prescribing longer days of supply and higher dose of stimulants. The most prevalent pay type of all cohorts was commercial insurance. ...|$|R

5|$|Methoxyflurane is an {{extremely}} potent and highly lipid-soluble anesthetic agent, characterized by very slow induction (onset of action) and emergence (offset or dissipation) times. It is non-flammable, has relatively mild hemodynamic effects, {{and it does not}} predispose the heart to rhythm disturbances. It is, however, a significant respiratory <b>depressant.</b> Methoxyflurane has powerful analgesic (pain-relieving) properties at well below full anesthetic doses. It was utilized in self-administration devices for obstetric analgesia, in a manner that foreshadowed the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today.|$|E
5|$|The {{wide range}} of psychoactive effects can be {{variously}} described as <b>depressant,</b> sedative-hypnotic, psychedelic, dissociative, and deliriant; paradoxical effects such as stimulation may occur however. Perceptual phenomena such as synesthesia, macropsia, and micropsia may occur. Some users report lucid dreaming {{under the influence of}} its hypnotic effects. Unlike Psilocybe cubensis, A.muscaria cannot be commercially cultivated, due to its mycorrhizal relationship with the roots of pine trees. However, following the outlawing of psilocybin mushrooms in the United Kingdom in 2006, the sale of the still legal A.muscaria began increasing.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{incidence}} of respiratory depression/arrest is low (0.1–0.5%) when midazolam is administered alone at normal doses, the concomitant use with CNS acting drugs, mainly analgesic opiates, may increase the possibility of hypotension, respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, and death, even at therapeutic doses. Potential drug interactions involving at least one CNS <b>depressant</b> were observed for 84% of midazolam users who were subsequently required to receive the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. Therefore, efforts directed toward monitoring drug interactions and preventing injuries from midazolam administration {{are expected to have}} a substantial impact on the safe use of this drug.|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} reveals that over 60 chemicals have been used for the capture of wild animals, but only 30 of the most widely used chemicals are discussed in the present paper. For practical considerations these chemicals can be classified as being either (l) neuromuscular blocking agents, or (2) central nervous system (CNS) <b>depressants.</b> Some common neuromuscular blocking agents are d-tubocurarine, gallamine, succiny 1 choline, and nicotine. M 99 and its derivatives, phencyclidine, and xylazine are some of the more commonly used CNS <b>depressants.</b> Neuromuscular blocking agents have a relatively rapid onset and short duration of action but they do not possess sedative, analgesic, or anesthetic properties. CNS <b>depressants</b> do produce desirable sedative, analgesic, and anesthetic effects, and frequently a combination of CNS <b>depressants</b> results in more desirable immobilization characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Kinds of {{pour point}} <b>depressants</b> were {{prepared}} from common monomers, octadecyl acrylate, maleic anhydride, styrene, acrylamide and vinyl acetate. Because the monomers have various functional groups, {{the performance of}} the polymers that were prepared from different monomers showed different. The performance of the pour point <b>depressants</b> on solubility in diesel and the drop of pour point on Daqing crude oil was studied. The results showed that styrene and vinyl acetate could increase the solubility of the pour point depressants; maleic anhydride and acrylamide could improve the drop of crude oil pour point; tercopolymer pour point <b>depressants</b> are more effective on the flow of crude oil than dimeric polymers, the highest drop of pour point was 14 ℃. Meanwhile, compostional pour point <b>depressants</b> are the best of them...|$|R

5|$|Nonbenzodiazepines are {{contraindicated}} during benzodiazepine withdrawal as {{they are}} cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and can induce dependence. Alcohol is also cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and more toxic and thus caution is needed to avoid replacing one dependence with another. During withdrawal, fluoroquinolone-based antibiotics are best avoided if possible; they displace benzodiazepines from their binding site and reduce GABA function and, thus, may aggravate withdrawal symptoms. Antipsychotics are not recommended for benzodiazepine withdrawal (or other CNS <b>depressant</b> withdrawal states) especially clozapine, olanzapine or low potency phenothiazines e.g. chlorpromazine as they lower the seizure threshold and can worsen withdrawal effects; if used extreme caution is required.|$|E
5|$|Throughout history {{mandrake}}s (Mandragora officinarum) {{have been}} highly sought after for their reputed aphrodisiac properties. However, {{the roots of}} the mandrake plant also contain large quantities of the alkaloid scopolamine, which, at high doses, acts as a central nervous system <b>depressant,</b> and makes the plant highly toxic to herbivores. Scopolamine was later found to be medicinally used for pain management prior to and during labor; in smaller doses it is used to prevent motion sickness. One of the most well-known medicinally valuable terpenes is an anticancer drug, taxol, isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia, in the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Unlike diethyl ether, {{methoxyflurane}} is {{a significant}} respiratory <b>depressant.</b> In dogs, methoxyflurane causes a dose-dependent decrease in respiratory rate and a marked decrease in respiratory minute volume, with a relatively mild decrease in tidal volume. In humans, methoxyflurane causes a dose-dependent decrease in tidal volume and minute volume, with respiratory rate relatively constant. The net effect of these changes is profound respiratory depression, as evidenced by CO2 retention with a concomitant decrease in arterial pH (this {{is referred to as}} a respiratory acidosis) when anesthetized subjects are allowed to breathe spontaneously for any length of time.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Depressants</b> are psychoactive {{drugs that}} {{temporarily}} diminish the function or activity {{of a specific}} {{part of the body}} or mind. Colloquially, <b>depressants</b> are known as [...] "downers", and users generally take them to feel more relaxed and less tense. Examples of these kinds of effects may include anxiolysis, sedation, and hypotension. <b>Depressants</b> are widely used throughout the world as prescription medicines and as illicit substances. When these are used, effects may include anxiolysis (reduction of anxiety), analgesia (pain relief), sedation, somnolence, cognitive/memory impairment, dissociation, muscle relaxation, lowered blood pressure/heart rate, respiratory depression, anesthesia, and anticonvulsant effects. <b>Depressants</b> exert their effects through a number of different pharmacological mechanisms, the most prominent of which include facilitation of GABA or opioid activity, and inhibition of adrenergic, histamine or acetylcholine activity. Some are also capable of inducing feelings of euphoria (a happy sensation).|$|R
5|$|A major {{disadvantage}} of benzodiazepines that tolerance to therapeutic effects develops relatively quickly while many adverse effects persist. Tolerance develops to hypnotic and myorelexant effects within days to weeks, and to anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects within weeks to months. Therefore, benzodiazepines {{are unlikely to}} be effective long-term treatments for sleep and anxiety. While BZD therapeutic effects disappear with tolerance, depression and impulsivity with high suicidal risk commonly persist. Several studies have confirmed that long-term benzodiazepines are not significantly different from placebo for sleep or anxiety. This may explain why patients commonly increase doses over time and many eventually take more than one type of benzodiazepine after the first loses effectiveness. Additionally, because tolerance to benzodiazepine sedating effects develops more quickly than does tolerance to brainstem <b>depressant</b> effects, those taking more benzodiazepines to achieve desired effects may suffer sudden respiratory depression, hypotension or death. Most patients with anxiety disorders and PTSD have symptoms that persist for at least several months, making tolerance to therapeutic effects a distinct problem for them and necessitating the need for more effective long-term treatment (e.g., psychotherapy, serotonergic antidepressants).|$|E
5|$|There is no antidote, and {{supportive}} care is {{the mainstay of}} further treatment for intoxication. Though {{sometimes referred to as}} a deliriant and while muscarine was first isolated from A. muscaria and as such is its namesake, muscimol does not have action, either as an agonist or antagonist, at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor site, and therefore atropine or physostigmine as an antidote is not recommended. If a patient is delirious or agitated, this can usually be treated by reassurance and, if necessary, physical restraints. A benzodiazepine such as diazepam or lorazepam can be used to control combativeness, agitation, muscular overactivity, and seizures. Only small doses should be used, as they may worsen the respiratory <b>depressant</b> effects of muscimol. Recurrent vomiting is rare, but if present may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances; intravenous rehydration or electrolyte replacement may be required. Serious cases may develop loss of consciousness or coma, and may need intubation and artificial ventilation. Hemodialysis can remove the toxins, although this intervention is generally considered unnecessary. With modern medical treatment the prognosis is typically good following supportive treatment.|$|E
