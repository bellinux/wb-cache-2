50|$|A pneumograph or {{respiratory}} {{strain gauge}} uses a <b>flexible</b> <b>sensor</b> band that is placed around the chest, abdomen, or both. The strain gauge method can provide feedback {{about the relative}} expansion/contraction of the chest and abdomen, and can measure respiration rate (the number of breaths per minute). Clinicians can use a pneumograph to detect and correct dysfunctional breathing patterns and behaviors. Dysfunctional breathing patterns include clavicular breathing (breathing that primarily relies on the external intercostals and the accessory muscles of respiration to inflate the lungs), reverse breathing (breathing where the abdomen expands during exhalation and contracts during inhalation), and thoracic breathing (shallow breathing that primarily relies on the external intercostals to inflate the lungs). Dysfunctional breathing behaviors include apnea (suspension of breathing), gasping, sighing, and wheezing.|$|E

A hybrid visual inspection system, which consists of an industrial robot with a <b>flexible</b> <b>sensor</b> and several stationary sensors, has been widely applied in mass production, especially in automobile manufacturing.
