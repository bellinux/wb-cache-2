40|$|Abstract Background To report {{acute and}} late {{toxicity}} in prostate cancer patients treated by dose escalated intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and organ tracking. Methods From 06 / 2004 to 12 / 2005 39 men were treated by 80 Gy IMRT along with organ tracking. Median age was 69 years, risk of recurrence was low 18 %, intermediate 21 % {{and high in}} 61 % patients. Hormone therapy (HT) was received by 74 % of patients. Toxicity was scored according to the CTC scale version 3. 0. Median follow-up (FU) was 29 months. Results Acute and maximal late grade 2 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity was 3 % and 8 %, late grade 2 GI toxicity dropped to 0 % {{at the end of}} <b>FU.</b> <b>No</b> acute or late grade 3 GI toxicity was observed. Grade 2 and 3 pre-treatment genitourinary (GU) morbidity (PGUM) was 20 % and 5 %. Acute and maximal late grade 2 GU toxicity was 56 % and 28 % and late grade 2 GU toxicity decreased to 15 % of patients at the end of FU. Acute and maximal late grade 3 GU toxicity was 8 % and 3 %, respectively. Decreased late ≥ grade 2 GU toxicity free survival was associated with higher age (P =. 025), absence of HT (P =. 016) and higher PGUM (P Discussion GI toxicity rates after IMRT and organ tracking are excellent, GU toxicity rates are strongly related to PGUM. </p...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: We {{assessed}} the clinical and radiological outcome after repeated radiosurgery for brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) after failure of initial radiosurgery. Materials and methods: Fifteen patients underwent repeated radiosurgery. The mean bAVM volume at first radiosurgery (Si) was 4. 6 +/- 4. 3 ml {{and that at}} second radiosurgery (52) was 2. 1 +/- 2. 5 ml. The median marginal dose was 18 Gy at S 1, and 21 Gy at S 2. Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) score was determined in all patients at last follow-up (FU). Results: Complete obliteration was reached in nine patients (60 %). Median time to obliteration was 50 months after S 2. An excellent outcome (no new neurologic deficiencies, complete obliteration) was reached in seven patients (47 %). Eleven patients (73 %) showed a MRS <= 1. Radiation-induced complications occurred in 20 %, of which 13 % occurred after S 2. Radiological complications included cyst formation (n = 1), radiation-related edema (n = 4), and radiation necrosis (n = 1), resulting in an increasing mean MRS of 0. 5 at S 1, 0. 6 at S 2, to 0. 8 at <b>FU.</b> <b>No</b> (re-) bleedings were encountered during 137 -patient years at risk. Discussion: Repeated radiosurgery is a viable option {{for the treatment of}} small remnant bAVMs. We report 20 % permanent radiation-induced complications. Such complications were mainly seen in relatively large, and therefore difficult to treat, bAVMs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|Background: The use of {{alternative}} ablation technologies {{instead of the}} former “cut-and-sew” technique {{on the basis of}} the Maze procedure has become more and more common in the surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF). Whether there are differences in the clinical outcome between the two energy sources used most often, microwave (MW) and radiofrequency (RF), is subject of this study. Furthermore, predictors of sinus rhythm (SR) restoration were examined. Methods: Between January 2004 and December 2005, 139 patients with chronic AF underwent valve surgery and/or coronary artery bypass grafting and concomitant endocardial, left atrial (LA) ablation. Ablation was performed by MW (n= 70) and RF (n= 69). Follow-up (FU) was after 3 or 6 months. Results: Baseline data of MW- and RF-group were similar. Postoperative SR was found in 49, 2 % (MW) versus 67, 2 % (RF) (p= 0, 037). 5 patients (7, 1 %) compared to 2 (2, 9 %) died perioperatively (p= 0, 253). Ablation caused no injury or death. Hospital length of stay was comparable for both groups. At <b>FU</b> <b>no</b> significant differences were found. SR conversion rate was 67, 9 % compared to 69, 4 % (p= 0, 869). Mortality was 12, 3 % (n= 8) versus 6 (n= 4) (p= 0, 205). Compared to non-SR-group, SR-group was associated with shorter AF duration (41, 8 ± 52, 81 months versus 111, 5 ± 135, 34 months, p= 0, 001) and smaller preoperative LA area (28, 4 ± 8, 36 cm 2 versus 32, 6 ± 8, 47 cm 2, p= 0, 047). Conclusions: MW- and RF-ablation represent two equivalent procedures in the surgical treatment of chronic AF. They offer a safe and rapid alternative to the conventional “cut-and-sew”-technique. AF duration and LA area were found to be predictors of SR restoration...|$|E

40|$|Stem {{cells have}} been {{repeatedly}} suggested for cardiac regeneration after myocardial infarction (MI). However, the low retention rate of single cell suspensions limits {{the efficacy of}} current therapy concepts so far. Taking advantage of three dimensional (3 D) cellular self-assembly prior to transplantation may be beneficial to overcome these limitations. In this pilot study we investigate the principal feasibility of intramyocardial delivery of in-vitro generated stem cell-based 3 D microtissues (3 D-MTs) in a porcine model. 3 D-MTs were generated from iron-oxide (MPIO) labeled human adipose-tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells (ATMSCs) using a modified hanging-drop method. Nine pigs (33  ±  2  kg) comprising seven healthy ones and two with chronic MI in the left ventricle (LV) anterior wall were included. The pigs underwent intramyocardial transplantation of 16  ×  10 (3) 3 D-MTs (1250  cells/MT; accounting for 2  ×  10 (7) single ATMSCs) into the anterior wall of the healthy pigs (n =  7) /the MI border zone of the infarcted (n =  2) of the LV using a 3 D NOGA electromechanical mapping guided, transcatheter based approach. Clinical follow-up (FU) was performed {{for up to five}} weeks and in-vivo cell-tracking was performed using serial magnet resonance imaging (MRI). Thereafter, the hearts were harvested and assessed by PCR and immunohistochemistry. Intramyocardial transplantation of human ATMSC based 3 D-MTs was successful in eight animals (88. 8 %) while one pig (without MI) died during the electromechanical mapping due to sudden cardiac-arrest. During <b>FU,</b> <b>no</b> arrhythmogenic, embolic or neurological events occurred in the treated pigs. Serial MRI confirmed the intramyocardial presence of the 3 D-MTs by detection of the intracellular iron-oxide MPIOs during FU. Intramyocardial retention of 3 D-MTs was confirmed by PCR analysis and was further verified on histology and immunohistochemical analysis. The 3 D-MTs appeared to be viable, integrated and showed an intact micro architecture. We demonstrate the principal feasibility and safety of intramyocardial transplantation of in-vitro generated stem cell-based 3 D-MTs. Multimodal cell-tracking strategies comprising advanced imaging and in-vitro tools allow for in-vivo monitoring and post-mortem analysis of transplanted 3 D-MTs. The concept of 3 D cellular self-assembly represents a promising application format as a next generation technology for cell-based myocardial regeneration...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{tracks the}} effects of state recognition across a series of vanishing and emerging social worlds in post-Fukushima Japan. Based upon two years of fieldwork, the dissertation focuses on ethnographic sites at which the failure of state subjectivization activates both a reinvigoration of state discourse, {{and the formation of}} counter-discourses within the temporality of Japan’s endless “postwar” (sengo). In so doing, the dissertation seeks to disclose the social violence and iteration of shame as it is mobilized by the state to produce an obedient subject – willing to die for the nation in war – and as the failure to conform precipitates alternate socialities that may be either opposed to or complicit with state interests. The ethnographic sites of which I write concentrate on: the compulsory enactment of propriety in public school ceremonies, and the refusal by teachers to stand for, bow to the “national flag” (kokki), and sing the “national anthem” (kokka), the self-same imperial symbols under which Japan conducted World War II; a group of Okinawan construction workers in the old day laborer district of Tokyo, Sanya; the stigmatized “radical” (kageki) leftist student organization, the Zengakuren; the “internet right-wing” (netto uyoku) group, the Zaittokai, whose street protests are performed live before a camera; and “Fukushima,” where the charge of guilt has short-circuited memories of the Japanese state sacrificing its citizens during World War II. As a foil for the remaining ethnographic sites, the obviousness of giving “respect” (sonchō) to state symbols in public school ceremonies discloses the formation of subjects in a constitutive misrecognition that eliminates – or kills – difference in the enactment of social totality. A veritable stain on which the Japanese state drive to war was dependent, the singular figure of the sitting teacher formed part and parcel of what rightist politicians referred to as the “negative legacy” (<b>fu</b> <b>no</b> rekishi) of World War II. S/he constituted the object of an overcoming that – alongside the Okinawan construction worker, the “radical” (kageki) leftist, the “resident foreigner” (zainichi) as object of Zaittokai hate speech, and “Fukushima” – at once marked the ground of intensification and failure of state discourse. For the graduation ceremony of March, 2012, the official number of teachers who refused to stand and sing fell to “ 1 ” in Tokyo, where the state employs 63, 000 teachers. With neither family ties, romantic involvements, nor social recognition that would confirm their masculinity, the vanishing day laborers of Sanya made all the more insistent reference to the trope of otoko or ‘man. ’ Closely articulated with the mobster world of the yakuza with which many workers had connections, the repetition of masculinity in work, gambling, and fighting constituted a discourse that repulsed the shaming gaze of general society. Thus, the excessive life-style of the otoko was located at the constitutive margins of the social bond of propriety, where he also provided a dying reserve army of labor that could be mobilized to undertake the most undesirable tasks, such as work at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Echoing the death of Sanya, the Zengakuren numbered {{in the tens of thousands}} in the 1960 s and 1970 s, but had dwindled to under 100 active members in 2012. While the anti-war “strike” (sutoraiki) constituted the apotheosis of the Zengakuren discourse, their espousal and shameless mandate of “violent” (bōryoku) revolution subverted the origins of the Zengakuren into a prohibitive discourse which replicated the form of state rhetoric, and demanded the eradication of the Stalinist from within their own ranks. No less shameless than the Zengakuren, the emergent hate speech of the “internet right-wing” (netto uyoku) iterated state discourse among the working poor. Having grown from 500 to 10, 000 members within only four years, the Zaittokai’s notorious hate speech aspired to the instantaneous effect of “killing” (korosu) another legacy of World War II: the “resident foreigner” (zainichi). Yet, replicating online forms of writing, the iterability of their performative triggered repetition, and in a shamelessness specific to cyberspace – in which the reciprocity of the gaze and shame were lacking – the Zaittokai directed their paranoid speech at the state, whose representatives were said to be controlled by zainichi. Lastly, “Fukushima” marked the apogee of the effectivity and failures of the state in containing both the excesses of capitalism, and the “negative legacy” (<b>fu</b> <b>no</b> rekishi) of World War II, the memories of which were short-circuited by radioactive outpour...|$|E

Further analyses of oxaliplatin+EGFR-I trials showed greater efficacy with infusional 5 FU regimens (PFS HR 0. 82, 95 % CI 0. 72 – 0. 94) compared to capecitabine (HR 1. 09; 95 % CI 0. 91 – 1. 30) and bolus 5 FU (HR 1. 07; 95 % CI 0. 79 – 1. 45); subgroup interaction was present with I 2 = 72 %, p = 0. 03. The oxaliplatin-irinotecan interaction was not evident for infusional 5 FU regimens. For AIs, OS benefit was observed with both oxaliplatin-based (HR 0. 83) and irinotecan-based (HR 0. 77) regimens without significant subgroup interactions. Oxaliplatin+AI trials showed no subgroup interactions by type of FP, whilst an interaction was present for irinotecan+AI trials although aflibercept was only used with infusional FP (I 2 = 89. 7 %, p = 0. 002). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE The addition of EGFR-I to irinotecan-based chemotherapy has consistent efficacy, regardless of FP regimen, whereas EGFR-I and oxaliplatin-based regimens were most active with infusional 5 <b>FU.</b> <b>No</b> such differential activity was observed with the varying chemotherapy schedules when combined with AIs.
