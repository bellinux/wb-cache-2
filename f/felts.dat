5|$|<b>Felts</b> Field is {{a general}} {{aviation}} airport serving the Spokane area and is located in east Spokane along the south bank of the Spokane River. Aviation at <b>Felts</b> Field dates back to 1913 and the strip served as Spokane's primary airport until commercial air traffic was redirected to Geiger Field after World War II. In 1927, the strip {{was one of the}} first in the western U.S. to receive official recognition as an airport by the U.S. Department of Commerce and is now named in honor of James Buell <b>Felts,</b> a Washington Air National Guard pilot.|$|E

By halftime, Manning had connected on another touchdown pass, this one a 23-yard strike to Leon <b>Felts.</b> Tech still held a 1714 lead, but Mississippi had the momentum and would receive the ball to begin the second half.|$|E
5|$|The group {{became a}} {{professional}} band in 1972, adding drummer Bennett Vartanian and changing their name to Wildcountry. During this time, the group accepted a position {{playing at the}} nearby Canyonland theme park. The park would bring in established stars, such as Jerry Wallace, Bobby Bare, and Narvel <b>Felts,</b> and the band would back them, afterwards performing a one-hour dance set. After a while, with opportunities for the band slimmed, a discouraged Cook took a government job in Anniston, Alabama. Owen was studying English at Jacksonville State University, and Cook had an electronics job. The trio shared at $56-a-month apartment in Anniston, working to keep the band afloat with night and weekend gigs. The group decided to become professional musicians in 1973, and began performing at bars throughout the Southeast. In March, the band relocated to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, performing six nights {{a week at a}} club named The Bowery for tips. They made their best money performing cover songs of Lynyrd Skynyrd and Merle Haggard. The group could not secure a record contract and began to self-finance recordings. The group borrowed $4,000 from a Fort Payne bank to record and release their own albums to sell at shows. Vartanian dropped out of the group, and following a rotation of four more drummers, they settled on Rick Scott in 1974.|$|E

50|$|Presses can be {{single or}} double <b>felted.</b> A single <b>felted</b> press has a <b>felt</b> {{on one side}} and a smooth roll on the other. A double <b>felted</b> press has both sides of the sheet in contact with a press <b>felt.</b> Single <b>felted</b> nips are useful when mated against a smooth roll (usually in the top position), which adds a two-sidedness—making the top side appear {{smoother}} than the bottom. Double <b>felted</b> nips impart roughness on both sides of the sheet. Double <b>felted</b> presses are desirable for the first press section of heavy paperboard.|$|R

25|$|Albany International has two divisions: Albany Engineered Composites and Machine Clothing. The former are {{primarily}} used in aerospace applications {{to help make}} craft lighter, such as the main brace on the landing gear assembled by Messier-Bugatti-Dowty for the 787 Dreamliner, the first use of structural composites {{in that part of}} a commercial airliner. Machine Clothing, headquartered in Neuhausen, Switzerland, is the company's traditional core business, descending from the <b>felts</b> used in early paper machines, still accounting for 86% of its sales in 2015. Specialized textiles that brace and dry paper as it travels through the machines that make it still makes up the majority of the Machine Clothing product line. Other customers for these engineered fabrics include makers of building products, such as flooring, shingles and carpet, and tanners (the company claims to be the largest manufacturer of <b>felts</b> for leather manufacture in the world). Its competitors include one other American company, Xerium Technologies, and two privately-held foreign concerns, Valmet Fabrics Oy and Asahi Kasei Spandex Europe GmbH.|$|E
25|$|Albany International Corporation, {{originally}} the Albany Felt Company, is an industrial-goods {{company based in}} Rochester, New Hampshire, United States. It makes two different lines of products: machine clothing, in particular <b>felts</b> for use in paper manufacturing and textile processing; and composites used in the aerospace industry. Its shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol AIN. It is included in both the S 600 and the Russell 2000 stock indices.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{much of the}} growing American paper {{industry}} was based along the Hudson River {{in and around the}} cities of Albany and Troy, due to the cities' proximity to the ample softwood forests of the nearby Adirondack Mountains, the major raw material for papermaking. To make paper, manufacturers used the Fourdrinier paper machine developed early in the century, which could make continuous paper rolls. In order to do so, its belts needed to be clothed in special <b>felts</b> that could both brace paper and help dry it.|$|E

25|$|The {{most likely}} origin of decoupage {{is thought to}} be East Siberian funerary art. Nomadic tribes would use cut out <b>felts</b> to {{decorate}} the tombs of their deceased. From Siberia, the practice came to China, and by the 12th century, cut out paper was being used to decorate lanterns, windows, boxes and other objects. In the 17th century, Italy, especially in Venice, was at the forefront of trade with the Far East and it is generally thought that it is through these trade links that the cut out paper decorations made their way into Europe.|$|E
25|$|The {{portion of}} the route outside of the Watertown city limits was {{originally}} maintained by Jefferson County as part of County Route52 (CR52), a highway extending from Watertown to <b>Felts</b> Mills.

40|$|Several {{methods to}} produce vapor grown carbon fibers (VGCFs) on {{graphite}} <b>felt</b> as electrodes for vanadium redox flow batteries (VRB) were described. The experiments include graphite <b>felt</b> preparation and VGCF production onto graphite fiber in the <b>felt.</b> Several {{attempts were made}} using nickel and cobalt catalyst coatings on the graphite <b>felt.</b> The nickel catalyst came from nickel nitride solution. It was prepared by dipping graphite <b>felt</b> into the solution and decomposed using heat treatment. Cobalt nanoparticles were sprayed onto graphite <b>felt.</b> Both experiments resulted in carbon nanotubes and VGCFs growth onto graphite fiber in the <b>felt.</b> The experimental results show that VGCFs and carbon nanotubes with the range of 20 to 70 nm in diameter are grown in the graphite <b>felt</b> using different catalysts.

40|$|The <b>felting</b> {{propensity}} of different animal fibers, particularly alpaca and wool, has been examined. The Aachen <b>felting</b> test method was employed. 1 g {{of each type}} of fiber was soaked in 50 ml of wetting solution and agitated in a dyeing machine to make <b>felt</b> balls. The diameter of each ball was measured in nine directions and the ball density was calculated in g/cm 3; the higher the density value of the ball, the higher the feltability of the fibers. The effects of fiber diameter and fiber length on the <b>felting</b> {{propensity of}} these fibers were investigated. The {{results show that the}} alpaca fibers <b>felt</b> to a higher degree than wool fibers, and short and fine cashmere fibers have lower <b>felting</b> propensity than wool fibers at a similar diameter range. There is a higher tendency of <b>felting</b> for bleached and dyed alpaca fibers than for untreated fibers.
