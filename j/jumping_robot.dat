A miniature 7g <b>jumping</b> <b>robot</b> inspired by locust has been developed at EPFL that can jump up to 138 cm. The jump event is induced by releasing the tension of a spring. The highest jumping miniature robot is inspired by the locust, weighs 23 grams with its highest jump to 365 cm is [...] "TAUB" [...] (Tel-Aviv University and Braude College of engineering) [...] It uses torsion springs as energy storage and includes a wire and latch mechanism to compress and release the springs. ETH Zurich has reported a soft <b>jumping</b> <b>robot</b> based on the combustion of methane and laughing gas. The thermal gas expansion inside the soft combustion chamber drastically increases the chamber volume. This causes the 2 kg robot to jump up to 20 cm. The soft robot inspired by a roly-poly toy then reorientates itself into an upright position after landing.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 The {{ability to}} <b>jump</b> allows small <b>robots</b> to {{traverse}} rough terrain, clear large obstacles, and quickly reach elevated locations. These abilities have applications {{in a variety}} of areas such as, search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and urban warfare. The primary focus in current state-of-the-art <b>jumping</b> <b>robots</b> has been on jumping as high or far as possible, with little focus on how to change the prelaunch dynamics to accomplish different trajectories. This lack of variety limits the utility of <b>jumping</b> <b>robots</b> by reducing their effective workspace. To solve this problem, we explored the jumping behavior of the Salticid family of jumping spiders. Salticid spiders are able to change their leg geometry and use their front legs to channel jump energy into a vaulting motion. Vaulting allows the spider to achieve alter trajectories than are possible by extension of the rear legs alone. We mapped the spiders jumping mechanism onto a four-bar linkage to develop a model for the spiders jumping mechanics. This model is then used to develop a robot that is able to effectively mimic the spider's jumping behavior...|$|R

40|$|Human jumping motion {{includes}} stance phase, flight {{phase and}} landing impact phase. <b>Jumping</b> <b>robot</b> {{belongs to a}} variable constraints system because every phase has different constraint conditions. An unified dynamics equation during stance phase and flight phase is established based on floated-basis space. Inertia matching is used to analyze actuator/gear systems and select the optimum gear ratio based on the transmission performance between the torque produced at the actuator and the torque applied to the load. Load matching is an important index which affects jumping performance and reflects the capability of supporting a weight or mass. It also affects the distributing {{of the center of}} gravity (COG). Regarding <b>jumping</b> <b>robot</b> as a redundant manipulator with a load at end-effector, inertia matching can be applied to optimize load matching for <b>jumping</b> <b>robot.</b> Inertia matching manipulability and directional manipulability are easy to analyze and optimize the load matching parameters. A 5 th order polynomial function is defined to plan COG trajectory of jumping motion, taking into account the constraint conditions of both velocity and acceleration.

The diversity of jumping mechanisms found in nature is explored to support the theory that jumping is a desirable ability for a robot locomotion system to incorporate, and then the size-related constraints are determined from first principles. A series of existing jumping robots are presented and their performance summarized. The authors present two new biologically inspired jumping robots, Jollbot and Glumper, both of which incorporate additional locomotion techniques of rolling and gliding respectively. Jollbot consists of metal hoop springs forming a 300 mm diameter sphere, and when jumping it raises its centre of gravity by 0. 22 m and clears a height of 0. 18 m. Glumper is of octahedral shape, with four 'legs' that each comprise two 500 mm lengths of CFRP tube articulating around torsion spring 'knees'.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} characterization {{and implementation of}} the first microfabrication process to incorporate high aspect ratio compliant polymer structures in-plane with traditional silicon microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). This discussion begins with in situ mechanical characterization of microscale polymer springs using silicon-on-insulator-MEMS (SOI-MEMS). The analysis compares microscale samples that were tested on-chip with macroscale samples tested using a dynamic mechanical analyzer. The results describe the effect of the processing steps on the polymer during fabrication and help to guide the design of mechanisms using polymers. Characterization of the dielectric breakdown of polymer thin films with thicknesses from 2 to 14 μm between silicon electrodes was also performed. The results demonstrate that there is a strong dependence of the breakdown field on both the electrode gap and shape. The breakdown fields ranged from 250 V/μm to 635 V/μm, depending on the electrode geometry and gap, approaching 10 x the breakdown fields for air gaps of the same size. These materials were then used to create compliant all-polymer thermal and electrostatic microactuators. All-polymer thermal actuators demonstrated displacements as large at 100 μm and forces as high as 55 μN. A 1 mm long electrostatic dielectric elastomer actuator demonstrated a tip displacement as high as 350 μm at 1. 1 kV with a electrical power consumption of 11 μW. The actuators are fabricated with elastomeric materials, so they are very robust and can undergo large strains in both tension and bending and still operate once released. Finally, the compliant polymer and silicon actuators were combined in an actuated bio-inspired system. Small insects and other animals use a multitude of materials to realize specific functions, including locomotion. By incorporating compliant elastomer structures in-plane with traditional silicon actuators, compact energy storage systems based on elastomer springs for small <b>jumping</b> <b>robots</b> were demonstrated.
