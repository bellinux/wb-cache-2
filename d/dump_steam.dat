50|$|Initially {{large amounts}} of rock and other debris were tipped at Branxholme to {{stabilise}} the line, however, this did not stay in place, particularly after heavy rains and subsequent flooding. In 1927, when scrap steel was an uneconomic proposition, New Zealand Railways started <b>dumping</b> obsolete <b>steam</b> locomotives at Branxholme to arrest erosion.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-1960s, the S1W core was removed. An {{extension}} was {{bolted to}} the top of the reactor vessel so that a larger S5W reactor core could be installed. After that time the prototype was called S1W/S5W core 4. The new core was first taken critical in late summer of 1967. In order to use the additional power generated by the S5W reactor, additional facilities were added in order to <b>dump</b> the excess <b>steam</b> when the plant was operated at higher power levels. These <b>steam</b> <b>dumps</b> were constructed in the same building, but outside the mock submarine hull.|$|R
50|$|Stack {{steaming}} is {{used when}} thermically treating compost and substrates such as turf. Depending on the amount, {{the material to}} be steamed is piled up to 70 cm height in steaming boxes or in small <b>dump</b> trailers. <b>Steam</b> is evenly injected via manifolds. For huge amounts, steaming containers and soil boxes are used which are equipped with suction systems to improve steaming results. Midget amounts can be steamed in special small steaming devices.|$|R
40|$|Given the {{following}} plant conditions:, Reactor is at 70 % power * Reactor power {{is higher than}} turbine power * Pressurizer level is increasing * Tave is greater than Tref and increasing * T AVE T REF DEVIATION 5 Â°F (FCF 4 - 6) has actuated Which ONE of {{the following}} has caused these conditions? A. Uncontrolled rod withdrawal. B. Inadvertent <b>steam</b> <b>dump</b> actuation. C. Excessive boration. D. Inadvertent AFW actuation. Answer: A Explanation/Justification: A. Correct. Uncontrolled rod withdrawal would cause reactor power to be above turbine power and temperature to be increasing. B. Incorrect. Inadvertent <b>steam</b> <b>dump</b> would cause reactor power to be above turbine power but, Tavg would be below Tref. C. Incorrect. Excessive boration would cause temperature to decrease. D.

50|$|Branxholme {{locomotive}} <b>dump</b> is a <b>steam</b> locomotive and wagon (rail car/vehicle) dump {{located on}} the eastern bank of the Oreti River adjacent and just {{to the north of}} Southland's Wairio Branch Line in New Zealand. Locomotives and rolling stock have been dumped here for river protection since the 1920s. In the time since numerous items have been recovered for preservation purposes.|$|R
50|$|Some {{time before}} 1971, the S5W vessel and core {{replaced}} the S1W reactor vessel and core at the S1W prototype facility. Even though operating an S5W reactor core, the facility {{continued to be}} called S1W. To use the additional power generated by the S5W reactor at higher power levels, <b>steam</b> <b>dumps</b> were constructed in the same S1W building but outside the original submarine style hull.|$|R
50|$|During this period, the New Zealand Railways Department <b>dumped</b> two old <b>steam</b> {{locomotives}} {{along the}} river's banks between Seddonville and Mokihinui Mine {{to protect against}} erosion. The first of these locomotives, WB 292, was dumped in 1958, while sister WB 299 was dumped in January 1960. Both were recovered from the Mokihinui River in 1989 by the Baldwin Steam Trust, and are under restoration at the Rimutaka Incline Railway.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this study, the {{development}} of TRACE (TRAC/RELAP Advanced Computational Engine) models for Maanshan nuclear power plant (NPP) important control systems, such as feedwater control system and <b>steam</b> <b>dump</b> control system, are performed in using SNAP (Symbolic Nuclear Analysis Program) / TRACE. The large-load reduction transient analysis of the Maanshan NPP control system TRACE models are also performed and {{the responses of the}} control systems of TRACE models compare with Maanshan NPP startup tests data to verify their accuracy. Analysis results of TRACE indicate that the responses of the Maanshan NPP control system TRACE models are consistent with the plant data for large-load reduction transient...|$|R

5000|$|In July 2013, {{the airport}} {{submitted}} three new proposals for expansion to the Airports Commission, {{which was established}} to review airport capacity in the South-east of England. Each involved {{the construction of a}} third runway, either to the north, northwest or southwest of the airport. The commission released its interim report in December 2013, shortlisting three options: the north-west third runway option at Heathrow, extending an existing runway at Heathrow, and a second runway at Gatwick Airport. After this report was published, the government confirmed that no options had been ruled out for airport expansion in the South-east and that a new runway would not be built at Heathrow before 2015. The full report was published on 1 July 2015, and backed a third, north-west, runway at Heathrow.Reaction to the report was generally negative, particularly from London Mayor Boris Johnson. One senior Conservative told Channel 4: [...] "Howard Davies has <b>dumped</b> an utter <b>steaming</b> pile of poo on the Prime Minister's desk."On 25 October 2016, the government confirmed that Heathrow would be allowed to build a third runway; however a final decision would not be taken until winter of 2017/18, after consultations and government votes.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work is to identify the predictability of RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 1 regarding thermal-hydraulic behavior during a steam generator tube rupture (SGTR). To evaluate the computed results, LSTF SB-SG- 06 test data simulating the SGTR that occurred at the Mihama Unit 2 in 1991 are used. Also, some sensitivity studies of the code change in RELAP 5, the break simulation model, and the break valve discharge coefficient are performed. The calculation {{results indicate that the}} RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 1 code predicted well the sequence of events and the major phenomena during the transient, such as the asymmetric loop behavior, reactor coolant system (RCS) cooldown and heat transfer by natural circulation, the primary and secondary system depressurization by the pressurizer auxiliary spray and the <b>steam</b> <b>dump</b> using the intact loop steam generator (SG) relief valve, and so on. However, there are some differences from the experimental data in the number of the relief valve cycling in the affected SG, and the flow regime of the hot leg with the pressurizer, and the break flow rates. Finally, the calculation also indicates that the coolant in the core could remain in a subcooled state {{as a result of the}} heat transfer caused by the natural circulation flow even if the reactor coolant pumps (RCPs) turned off and that the affected SG could be properly isolated to minimize the radiological release after the SGTR...|$|R
