5|$|<b>Fluor</b> Corporation's predecessor, Rudolph <b>Fluor</b> & Brother, {{was founded}} in 1890 by John Simon <b>Fluor</b> and his two {{brothers}} in Oshkosh, Wisconsin as a saw and paper mill. John <b>Fluor</b> acted as its president and contributed $100 in personal savings to help the business get started. The company was renamed <b>Fluor</b> Bros. Construction Co. in 1903.|$|E
5|$|In 1912 John <b>Fluor</b> {{moved to}} Santa Ana, California {{for health reasons}} without his {{brothers}} and founded <b>Fluor</b> Corporation out of his garage under the name <b>Fluor</b> Construction Company. By 1924 the business had annual revenues of $100,000 ($1.36 million in 2013 dollars) and a staff of 100 employees. John <b>Fluor</b> delegated most of the company's operations to his sons, Peter and Simon <b>Fluor.</b> A $100,000 capital investment was made that year and it was incorporated. John's eldest son Peter served as head of sales and grew the company to $1.5 million ($20.4 million in 2013 dollars) in revenues by 1929. In 1929 the company re-incorporated as <b>Fluor</b> Corporation. By the 1930s, <b>Fluor</b> had operations in Europe, the Middle East and Australia. Business declined rapidly during the Great Depression, but picked up again during World War II. During the war <b>Fluor</b> manufactured synthetic rubber and was responsible for {{a substantial portion of}} high-octane gasoline production in the United States. A Gas-Gasoline division of <b>Fluor</b> was created in Houston in 1948.|$|E
5|$|The company sold $750 {{million in}} assets, {{including}} Fluor's headquarters in Irvine, {{in order to}} pay $1 billion in debt. Staff were reduced from 32,000 to 14,000. In 1986 <b>Fluor</b> sold all of its oil assets and some of its gold mining operations. <b>Fluor</b> Engineers, Inc. and Daniel International were merged, forming <b>Fluor</b> Daniel. By 1987, <b>Fluor</b> had returned to profitability with $26.6 million in profits and $108.5 million by 1989. By the end of the restructuring, <b>Fluor</b> had three major divisions: <b>Fluor</b> Daniel, <b>Fluor</b> Construction International and St. Joe Minerals Corp. Each division had its own smaller subsidiaries. <b>Fluor</b> started being named by Engineering News as the largest construction and engineering company in the United States. Fluor's international revenues rebounded. Having postponed his retirement to help <b>Fluor,</b> Tappan stepped {{down at the end of}} 1989 and was replaced by Leslie McCraw.|$|E

5000|$|DyLight <b>Fluors</b> are {{synthesized}} through sulfonate {{addition to}} coumarin, xanthene (such as fluorescein and rhodamine), and cyanine dyes. Sulfonation makes DyLight dyes negatively charged and hydrophilic. DyLight <b>Fluors</b> are commercially available as reactive succinimidyl-esters for labeling proteins through lysine residues, and as maleimide derivatives for labeling proteins through cysteine residues. Antibodies conjugated {{are also available}} from several companies.|$|R
50|$|As {{with most}} {{fluorescence}} techniques, {{a significant problem}} with immunofluorescence is photobleaching. Loss of activity caused by photobleaching can be controlled by reducing or limiting the intensity or time-span of light exposure, by increasing the concentration of fluorophores, or by employing more robust fluorophores that are less prone to bleaching (e.g., Alexa <b>Fluors,</b> Seta <b>Fluors,</b> or DyLight <b>Fluors).</b> Some problems that may arise from this technique include autofluorescence, extraneous undesired specific fluorescence, and nonspecific fluorescence. Autofluorescence includes fluorescence emitted from the sample tissue or cell itself. Extraneous undesired specific fluorescence occurs when a targeted antigen is impure and contains antigenic contaminants. Nonspecific fluorescence involves {{the loss of a}} probe's specificity due to fluorophore, from improper fixation, or from a dried out specimen.|$|R
5|$|<b>Fluor</b> {{built the}} Aladdin Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas in 2001 for $1.4 billion. In 2004, {{the company was}} awarded a $1.1 billion project with AMEC to help rebuild the water, power and civic {{infrastructure}} of Iraq after the Iraq War. <b>Fluor</b> has also built a rail line in Europe and missile sites in Arizona. The company provided disaster recovery services in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina. In 2010 <b>Fluor</b> provided workers to clean up oil tar on beaches in Florida and Alabama after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. In December 2012, <b>Fluor</b> was awarded a $3.14 billion contract {{to build a new}} Tappan Zee Bridge over the Hudson River.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fluor</b> diversified its {{business}} more extensively in 1967, when five companies were merged into a division called Coral Drilling {{and it started}} a deep-water oil exploration business in Houston called Deep Oil Technology. It also created <b>Fluor</b> Ocean Services in Houston in 1968 and acquired an interest in other fossil fuel operations in the 1970s. <b>Fluor</b> acquired a construction company, Pike Corp. of America and the engineering division of its prior partner in Australia, Utah Construction. In 1972, <b>Fluor</b> bought land in Irvine, California and started building its new headquarters on it. The following year, the company's oil and gas operations were consolidated under a new entity, <b>Fluor</b> Oil and Gas Corp.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fluor</b> {{was founded}} in 1912 by John Simon <b>Fluor</b> as <b>Fluor</b> Construction Company. It grew quickly, {{predominantly}} by building oil refineries, pipelines and other facilities for {{the oil and gas}} industry, at first in California, and then in the Middle East and globally. In the late 1960s, it began diversifying into oil drilling, coal mining and other raw materials like lead. A global recession in {{the oil and gas industry}} and losses from its mining operation led to restructuring and layoffs in the 1980s. <b>Fluor</b> sold its oil operations and diversified its construction work into a broader range of services and industries.|$|E
50|$|Common <b>fluors</b> include {{polyphenyl}} hydrocarbons, oxazole and oxadiazole aryls, especially, n-terphenyl (PPP), 2,5-diphenyloxazole (PPO), 1,4-di-(5-phenyl-2-oxazolyl)-benzene (POPOP), 2-phenyl-5-(4-biphenylyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (PBD), and 2-(4’-tert-butylphenyl)-5-(4’’-biphenylyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (B-PBD).|$|R
50|$|Reaction with DAB can be {{enhanced}} using nickel, producing a deep purple/black staining. Fluorescent reporters are small, organic molecules used for IHC detection and traditionally include FITC, TRITC and AMCA, while commercial derivatives, including the Alexa <b>Fluors</b> and Dylight <b>Fluors,</b> show similar enhanced performance but vary in price. For chromogenic and fluorescent detection methods, densitometric analysis of the signal can provide semi- and fully quantitative data, respectively, to correlate the level of reporter signal {{to the level of}} protein expression or localization.|$|R
50|$|To use the DyLight <b>Fluors</b> with {{fluorescent}} imagers, use a {{spectral line}} of the blue laser diode for DyLight 405, a cyan (488 nm) laser for DyLight 488, a green (526 nm) laser for DyLight 550 and 594, and a red (633 nm) laser for DyLight 633 and 650. The DyLight 680, 755 and 800 <b>fluors</b> are compatible with laser- and filter-based infrared imaging instruments that emit in the 700 nm, 750 nm and 800 nm region of the spectrum, respectively.|$|R
5|$|In 1997, Fluor's {{revenues}} fell almost 50 percent, in {{part due}} to the Asian financial crisis and a decrease in overseas business. Additionally, it suffered losses from an over-budget power plant project in Rabigh, Saudi Arabia. <b>Fluor</b> was a sub-contractor to General Electric for the project. Fluor's subsidiaries sued GE alleging that it misrepresented the complexity of the project. Though revenues declined further the following year, profits were increasing. In 1999, nearly 5,000 workers were laid off from <b>Fluor</b> Daniel and 15 offices were closed. <b>Fluor</b> Daniel was re-structured into four business groups: an engineering and construction firm called <b>Fluor</b> Daniel; an equipment rental, staffing and telecommunications division called <b>Fluor</b> Global Services; a coal-mining business called A.T. Massey Coal Co. and an administrative and support division called <b>Fluor</b> Signature Services.|$|E
5|$|Against his father's wishes, Peter <b>Fluor</b> {{expanded}} Fluor's business {{outside of}} California in the 1930s. It built refineries in Texas, {{as well as}} oil pipelines and compressor stations from Panhandle, Texas, to Indianapolis, Indiana, for the Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Company. <b>Fluor</b> constructed the Escondida in Chile, which is the second-largest copper mine in the world. In 1942, <b>Fluor</b> constructed cooling towers and other facilities in Hanford, Washington, for the Manhattan Project. It built {{an expansion of the}} Dhahran Airfield in Saudi Arabia for the United States Army in the 1950s and accepted its first international project for ARAMCO in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fluor</b> {{has been}} working on the cleanup and {{shutdown}} of atomic energy plants in Ohio and Washington since the 1990s. In 1992, <b>Fluor</b> won a contract with the United States Energy Department to clean up nuclear waste. By 1996 Hanford was the most contaminated nuclear site in the US and the US Department of Energy was conducting a $50 billion to $60 billion cleanup of the site. <b>Fluor</b> Hanford Inc. replaced Westinghouse Hanford Co. on the project. After a chemical explosion in 1997, 11 workers filed a lawsuit alleging they were denied appropriate medical attention and protective gear. <b>Fluor</b> and the workers disagreed on whether the explosion resulted in any injuries. In 2005 the US Department of Energy fined <b>Fluor</b> for safety violations and that same year a jury awarded $4.7 million in damages to 11 pipe fitters that claimed they were fired after complaining that a valve rated for 1,975 pounds-per-inch was being used where 2,235 were needed.|$|E
50|$|Loss of {{activity}} caused by photobleaching {{can be controlled}} by reducing the intensity or time-span of light exposure, by increasing the concentration of fluorophores, by reducing the frequency and thus the photon energy of the input light, or by employing more robust fluorophores that are less prone to bleaching (e.g. Alexa <b>Fluors</b> or DyLight <b>Fluors).</b> To a reasonable approximation, a given molecule will be destroyed after a constant exposure (intensity of emission X emission time X number of cycles) because, in a constant environment, each absorption-emission cycle has an equal probability of causing photobleaching.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{fluorescent}} molecules called fluorophores or fluorochromes such as fluorescein, Alexa <b>Fluors</b> or DyLight 488, {{which can be}} chemically linked to a different molecule which binds the target of interest within the sample.|$|R

40|$|Three-dimensional ordered {{photonic}} crystals {{have been}} fabricated on solid substrates with a self-assembling method starting from a suspension of dye-doped polymeric nanospheres in water. These photonic crystals showed angle-dependent stop band for light transmission and, correspondingly, Bragg reflection peak {{due to the}} photonic crystal lattice. Polystyrene nanoparticles of 306 nm and 288 nm diameter, respectively {{in the case of}} the Rhodamine B and <b>Fluored</b> dye, were used to obtain self-assembled photonic crystals. They show 40 % reflectance at 610 nm for Rhodamine B and 35 % reflectance at 574 nm for <b>Fluored</b> doped materials. The size of the spheres calculated by Bragg’s law are in good agreement with those evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The appropriate choice of sphere diameters results in an overlap between the photonic stop-band and the dye emission spectrum. The photonic crystals showed angle-dependent suppression of spontaneous emission of the dye in the wavelength range of the photonic stop band and enhancement near the band edge. In reflection geometries, spectral narrowing and directional emission, all indicative of stimulated emission, were observed from the active photonic crystal matrix. The results of laser induced emission studies on the dye doped photonic crystals are presente...|$|R
5|$|To {{supervise}} {{the construction of}} the pipeline, Alyeska appointed two construction management contractors to oversee all the other subcontractors in the project. Bechtel Corporation, from San Francisco, was named the management contractor for the pipeline itself. <b>Fluor</b> Alaska Inc., a division of <b>Fluor</b> Corp., was named the management contractor for the pumping stations and Valdez Marine Terminal, which was the most complex single section of the pipeline, since it involved the transfer of oil from the pipeline to seagoing oil tankers.|$|E

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{is focused}} on composite scintillating materials for gamma-ray and fast neutron spectroscopy. The inorganic-organic composite scintillators have been successfully fabricated and investigated. By leveraging the virtues of inorganics' high stopping power and plastics' ease of fabrication, the low cost composites are potentially serving {{as a candidate for}} the next generation high energy radiation detection materials. New polymer matrix and coupled <b>fluors</b> are developed to obtain plastic scintillating materials, where efficient Foster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) is fulfilled. This material possesses fast response time and good processibility, and the best light yield is over 5 times than that of commercial available plastic scintillators. Gamma-ray and neutron sensitizers are synthesized and investigated, including metal oxide nanocrystals and organometallics. These sensitizers are soluble in organic solvent, satisfying photophysical requirements for efficient scintillation, and are readily being incorporated into composites. Subsequently, a surface-catalyzed polymerization approach is proposed to fabricate bulk composites via UV curing. The composites are highly transparent at high loading of nanocrystals. Composites scintillators are prepared loaded with different sensitizers and different <b>fluors.</b> Photoelectric peak for Cs- 137 gamma was obtained from these samples with an energy resolution of 10 %, suggesting potential use of these composites for high energy radiation detection...|$|R
