The proposal led to public protests against the Maryland plan in Anacostia, and heated arguments on the WMATA board of directors.

5|$|The Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court {{ruled that}} NYSDOT had {{to provide a}} new <b>environmental</b> <b>report</b> by May12, 1989 or face having the {{reconstruction}} shut down. The order by the court reversed {{a decision by the}} New York State Supreme Court that determined that a revised report was unnecessary. Residents of Westbury claimed that the project would bring noise concerns to the village, along with a spillover of diverted traffic to local roads. Concerns were also stated by then-mayor Ernest Strada about Westbury's water supply and potential impacts from the project. NYSDOT claimed that no disruption would be caused by the project, but Strada insisted there were still concerns. Strada also stated that the village had no interest in shutting down the project; rather, they wanted to ensure that their community would be protected from any disruptions caused by the reconstruction. On April24, NYSDOT announced they had appealed the stoppage of work on the interchange, which had been suspended pending a ruling by the Court of Appeals, the highest court in the state.|$|E
40|$|The broad {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to assess the decision-usefulness of <b>environmental</b> <b>reports</b> produced by South African companies that are listed on the Johanessburg Securities Exchange (JSE) to users of the reports. The study was motivated by a lack of research on the decision-usefulness of <b>environmental</b> <b>reports</b> in South Africa. The study was conducted in two phases. The first phase in form of a content analysis evaluated the decision-usefulness of the <b>environmental</b> <b>reports</b> of top 100 JSE-listed South African companies using a control list and a judgement scale. The second phase in form of a questionnaire survey was aimed at determining, the information needs of users of <b>environmental</b> <b>reports</b> produced by South African companies (that are listed on the JSE), {{the extent to which they}} read and employ the reports for making decisions. In addition, this phase was meant to ascertain the degree of users' satisfaction with the decision-usefulness of the <b>environmental</b> <b>reports</b> as well as elicit their suggestions on ways of improving the reports. Furthermore, the second phase was aimed at determining the users’ perception of the relative importance of <b>environmental</b> <b>reports</b> as well as ascertaining whether there was an expectation gap between the users and the preparers of the reports with regard to their decision-usefulness. The results of the content analysis phase of the study indicate that the <b>environmental</b> <b>reports</b> of the sampled companies were decision-useful, however their decision-usefulness varied widely. Although decision-useful, the <b>environmental</b> <b>reports</b> of the sampled companies were not comparable. In addition, the <b>environmental</b> <b>reports</b> of companies from sectors with a significant impact on the environment, and those of large companies were more decision-useful than the reports of companies from sectors with an insignificant impact on the environment and those of smaller companies. The results of the questionnaire survey phase of the study indicate that users prefer balanced <b>environmental</b> <b>reports</b> that disclose both negative and positive aspects that identify and describe key relevant issues, that are specific and contain accurate information, and that provide future oriented information. In addition, users prefer <b>environmental</b> <b>reports</b> that identify and address key stakeholders and their concerns, demonstrate the integration of environmental issues into core business processes, and that compare quantitative impacts against best practice. Furthermore, the results also indicate that users do read <b>environmental</b> <b>reports,</b> mostly from companies’ websites Portable Document Format (PDF) annual reports and that they mostly use the <b>environmental</b> <b>reports</b> for research, their own knowledge, and to hold companies accountable. However, users are not fully satisfied with the decision-usefulness of the <b>environmental</b> <b>reports</b> as they feel that there is a need to improve the reports in order to make them more decision-useful. The results also indicate that users perceive <b>environmental</b> <b>reports</b> to be more important than any other type of reports, most notably the financial reports. Comparing the responses of the users to those of preparers on various issues pertaining to the decision-usefulness of <b>environmental</b> <b>reports,</b> significant differences were found between the views of the two groups. These differences provide ample evidence that is consistent with the existence of an <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> expectation gap in South Africa. This study makes several original contributions to <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> literature, most notable of which is that, it is the first study in the South African context to empirically evaluate the quality (decision-usefulness) of <b>environmental</b> <b>reports</b> in line with the accounting conceptual frameworks and the GRI guidelines combined. By so doing, the study introduces to the academic literature an extensive five dimensional qualitative characteristic framework for evaluating the quality (decision-usefulness) of <b>environmental</b> <b>reports.</b> In addition, the study uniquely employs the decision-usefulness theory to provide insights into the <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> practices of South African companies that are listed on the JSE. In so doing, it re-contextualises the theory that is typically employed in explaining financial reporting, and demonstrates its applicability in explaining the decision-usefulness of the <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> practices of South African companies that are listed on the JSE.

40|$|Before 1990 <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> in Sweden was a {{marginal}} and unsystematic activity undertaken {{by a small}} number of large companies in high-profile industries. The 1990 's have witnessed a dramatic increase in <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> practice, and today a large number of companies in almost all industries annually report considerable amounts of environmental information. Increasingly, companies are publishing this information in separate annual <b>environmental</b> <b>reports.</b> The thesis provides a detailed survey of Swedish listed companies' <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> practices for the years 1990 through 1996. Following this survey the thesis presents a study of possible causes of the development of the <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> trend, and a detailed analysis of financial <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> concepts disclosed by companies. The study of concepts shows that this type of <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> is uncommon in practice and confirms that it is highly problematic. In part, {{this is due to the}} difficulty in separating environmental activities from other business activities. The study also shows that these concepts may be disclosed and interpreted in a number of ways, thus limiting their usefulness. The study of possible causes shows that size and industry are prerequisites for <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> during the early part of the period. Pressure by environmental groups has been a direct cause of disclosure in certain companies, but various internal organizational factors determine how a particular company reacts to such pressures. The rapid diffusion of <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> practice may partly be explained by the tendency of companies to mimic the behaviour of their peers and competitors. In this sense, <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> has become a reporting norm among listed companies. It is also an interesting example of how such norms develop through mimetic behaviour among report-makers, rather than as a result of professional debate among accounting regulators...|$|R

Since 1970, forestry sector have contributed for over 50% of the state revenue, of which a study conducted in 1997 revealed the state had almost depleted all of its virgin forests outside the conservation areas. The state government were determined to maintain the state biodiversity while {{to make sure the}} state economy continue to alive. While in the same time facing hard task to control such activities although there is laws to prevent it. In addition, the need for development and basic necessities also became an issue while to preserving the nature. Mining activities had directly released pollutants of heavy metals into rivers, reservoirs, ponds and affecting groundwater through the leaching of mine tailings. An <b>environmental</b> <b>report</b> released in 1994 reported the presence of heavy metal at the Damit/Tuaran River that exceeded the water quality safe levels for consumption. The water in Liwagu River also reported the presence of heavy metal which was believed to be originated from the Mamut Copper Mine. Forest fire also have become the latest concern due to drought and fires set by irresponsible farmers or individuals such as what happened in the 2016 forest fires where thousand hectares of forest reserve areas in Binsuluk of the west coast Sabah are lost.|$|E

It is not stated that biomass energy is used and most of the energy is purchased (48%) or made from oil (44%).

Local agriculture produces mostly rice, mandarins and local salad onions. After the Minamata disease scandal local farmers wanted to show that their products were safe, so they changed their way of production by: not using pesticides anymore, use 70% less fertilizer and instead started using a special fertilizer from Chisso. In the 2011 <b>environmental</b> <b>report</b> the local production was stable for the last 10 years and the advice was to promote local production. Fishing was not possible from 1970 till 1997, because the bay was closed with a net to prevent the catching of contaminated fish. During this period fishers were compensated by the local government. When the nets were removed sardine catching started to flourish and there now are full-time and part-time fishers, who combine fishing with other jobs.|$|E

In this paper an approach of internet-based <b>environmental</b> <b>reports</b> by companies is presented. Three different levels are discussed: The first level deals with the basics of corporate <b>environmental</b> <b>reports</b> (CER) by companies. Illustrating the order within the emerging field of CERs a morphological box is suggested (section 1).

40|$|<b>Environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> is {{becoming}} more and more common in business since most companies are aware ofthat environment as a business issue and it makes good business sense and positive public relations.

40|$|Society is {{increasingly}} calling for organisations to demonstrate {{corporate social responsibility}} (CSR). To fulfil this demand, organisations need to be accountable, democratic and transparent to their stakeholders. This can be achieved using a number of tools including communication about the environmental, social and economic impacts of an organisation’s actions and activities. Yet despite the importance of communicating environmental information, and society’s heightened environmental awareness, organisations are still demonstrating an insufficient commitment to <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting,</b> continuing their reluctance to be open and accountable about their environmental impacts. This suggests organisations currently have little understanding of why they should report, what they should report and/or how they should <b>report.</b> For <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> progress to be achieved {{it is important that}} we have knowledge of how various factors influence voluntary <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> engagement. This research, in contributing to and extending the body of <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> knowledge, aims to provide an understanding of the Why, What and How of voluntary <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> by specifically examining: why organisations should, and why organisations do, voluntarily <b>report</b> <b>environmental</b> information; what environmental information organisations should, and what environmental information organisations do, voluntarily report; and how organisations should, and how organisations do, voluntarily <b>report</b> <b>environmental</b> information. In using a combination of research methodologies this research extends prior CSR reporting studies – closing the gap between voluntary <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> practice and theory, providing better insights into the underlying reasons and motivations for voluntary <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting,</b> and providing improved knowledge of the considerations made by companies as part of the voluntary <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> process. In doing so, this research presents a more recent examination of voluntary <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> in the annual reports of New Zealand and Australian publicly listed companies. Aspects of voluntary <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> that have not been extensively examined before, particularly in Australasia, are examined. These include a focus on content-quality (as opposed to reporting quantity), an investigation of the effect of public pressure (using a combination of three proxy measures), and, through the use of qualitative research, an expansion of the insights obtained from quantitative data. This research finds that New Zealand and Australian publicly listed companies continue to have an insufficient and incorrect understanding of why they should report, what they should report and/or how they should voluntarily <b>report</b> <b>environmental</b> information. This deficient understanding results in voluntary <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> in their annual reports which is inadequate – the reporting lacks meaning and purpose (i. e. has form but little or no substance), and reflects managers’ incorrect perceptions about the environmental impact of their company’s actions and activities. As a result voluntary <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> in the annual reports of New Zealand and Australian publicly listed companies fails to “… give an understanding, which is not misleading, …” of the environmental consequences of an organisation’s actions and activities (adapted from Alexander & Jermakowicz, 2006, p. 132), providing little accountability to stakeholders, and serving neither external stakeholders nor those reporting well.

Also, the paper analysis the articles treating international <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting,</b> articles publised in ISI quoted or BDI indexed journals. The collection and analysis of reporting frames, the interpretation and analysis thereof represent the main instruments used in order to bring to the forefront the main existing <b>reporting</b> frames for <b>environmental</b> information, found at international level.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to better {{understand}} why the social and <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> practices of New Zealand business entities are ‘starting behind’ international counterparts. An integral aspect is gaining {{an understanding of the}} role of key players in the organisational field who have the potential to influence social and <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> in New Zealand. This thesis is motivated by the importance of business entities pursuing sustainability-related practices, and being accountable for their actions through providing external social and <b>environmental</b> <b>reports.</b> The theoretical framework for this research is neo-institutional theory. The research method involved mapping the organisational field in order to identify players that influence, or have the potential to influence the social and <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> practices of New Zealand business entities. Initially comprehensive background information was collected from websites, academic articles, surveys and a University of Canterbury archive. Subsequently semi-structured interviews were conducted with key players, Chief Executives from three Sustainable Business Intermediaries and Senior Executives from 11 of their members. Findings from the interviews were analysed through an iterative process allowing for emerging themes to be analysed using prior literature and explained through the lens of neo-institutional theory. The findings and analysis chapters are structured according to the research questions. Chapter six finds weak isomorphic pressures have influenced New Zealand business entities’ social and <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> practices, but have not institutionalised this practice. The rationales of accountability and the business case have both motivated and caused resistance to business entities’ engagement in social and <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting.</b> Chapter seven finds the role of Sustainable Business Intermediaries facilitates weak isomorphic pressures on members’ social and <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> practice. However, the business case rationale results in resistance to the practice of social and <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> with legitimacy a key focus of these field players. Although coercive pressure in New Zealand is weak or lacking there is potential through field players’ roles to influence or enforce coercive pressure. The research concludes with recommendations that the New Zealand government should regulate social and <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting.</b> There has been extensive research focusing on various aspects of social and <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting.</b> However, there is little work focusing on the role and influence of field players through engagement-based research. Hence filling this gap extends the understanding of key field players’ influence on and interest in institutionalising social and <b>environmental</b> <b>reporting</b> and why this practice is resisted.
