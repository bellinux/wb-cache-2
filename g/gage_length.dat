50|$|The {{specimen}} {{is stretched}} slowly in tension until it breaks, while the load {{and the distance}} across the <b>gage</b> <b>length</b> are continuously monitored. A sample subjected to a tensile test can typically withstand stresses higher than its yield stress without breaking. At a certain point, however, the sample will break into two pieces. This happens because the microscopic cracks that resulted from yielding will spread to large scales. The stress {{at the point of}} complete breakage is called a material’s ultimate tensile strength. The result is a stress-strain curve of the material's behavior under static loading. Through this tensile testing, the yield strength is found {{at the point where the}} material begins to yield more readily to the applied stress, and its rate of deformation increases.|$|E
5000|$|Ductility {{is defined}} as ‘‘an {{extent to which a}} {{material}} can sustain plastic deformation without rupture.’’ It is not only required in the forming process but is also needed for plastic redistribution of stress in members and connections, where stress concentration would occur. The ductility criteria and performance of low-ductility steels for cold-formed members and connections have been studied by Dhalla, Winter, and Errera at Cornell University. It was found that the ductility measurement in a standard tension test includes local ductility and uniform ductility. Local ductility is designated as the localized elongation at the eventual fracture zone. Uniform ductility is the ability of a tension coupon to undergo sizeable plastic deformations along its entire length prior to necking. This study also revealed that for the different ductility steels investigated, the elongation in 2-in. (50.8-mm) <b>gage</b> <b>length</b> did not correlate satisfactorily with either the local or the uniform ductility of the material.

5000|$|Low {{carbon steel}} {{generally}} exhibits a very linear stress-strain relationship up to a well defined yield point (Fig.2). The linear {{portion of the}} curve is the elastic region and the slope is the modulus of elasticity or Young's Modulus ( [...] Young's Modulus is {{the ratio of the}} compressive stress to the longitudinal strain).Many ductile materials including some metals, polymers and ceramics exhibit a yield point. Plastic flow initiates at the upper yield point and continues at the lower one. At lower yield point, permanent deformation is heterogeneously distributed along the sample. The deformation band which formed at the upper yield point will propagate along the <b>gage</b> <b>length</b> at the lower yield point. The band occupies the whole of the gage at the luders strain. Beyond this point, work hardening commences. The appearance of the yield point is associated with pinning of dislocations in the system. Specifically, solid solution interacts with dislocations and acts as pin and prevent dislocation from moving. Therefore, the stress needed to initiate the movement will be large. As long as the dislocation escape from the pinning, stress needed to continue it is less.|$|E
50|$|For perspective, {{outstanding}} breakthroughs {{have already}} been made. Pioneering work led by Ray H. Baughman at the NanoTech Institute has shown that single and multi-walled nanotubes can produce materials with toughness unmatched in the man-made and natural worlds.Carbon nanotubes are also a promising material as building blocks in hierarchical composite materials given their exceptional mechanical properties (~1 TPa in modulus, and ~100 GPa in strength). Initial attempts to incorporate CNTs into hierarchical structures (such as yarns, fibres or films) has led to mechanical properties that were significantly lower than these potential limits. The hierarchical integration of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and metal/metal oxides within a single nanostructure can leverage the potentiality of carbon nanotubes composite for water splitting and electrocatalysis. Windle et al. have used an in situ chemical vapor deposition (CVD) spinning method to produce continuous CNT yarns from CVD-grown CNT aerogels. CNT yarns can also be manufactured by drawing out CNT bundles from a CNT forest and subsequently twisting to form the fibre (draw-twist method, see picture on right). The Windle group have fabricated CNT yarns with strengths as high as ~9 GPa at small gage lengths of ~1 mm, however, strengths of only about ~1 GPa were reported at the longer <b>gage</b> <b>length</b> of 20 mm. The reason why fibre strengths have been low compared {{to the strength of}} individual CNTs is due to a failure to effectively transfer load to the constituent (discontinuous) CNTs within the fibre. One potential route for alleviating this problem is via irradiation (or deposition) induced covalent inter-bundle and inter-CNT cross-linking to effectively 'join up' the CNTs, with higher dosage levels leading to the possibility of amorphous carbon/carbon nanotube composite fibres. Espinosa et al. developed high performance DWNT-polymer composite yarns by twisting and stretching ribbons of randomly oriented bundles of DWNTs thinly coated with polymeric organic compounds. These DWNT-polymer yarns exhibited an unusually high energy to failure of ~100 J·g−1 (comparable to one of the toughest natural materials - spider silk), and strength as high as ~1.4 GPa. Effort is ongoing to produce CNT composites that incorporate tougher matrix materials, such as Kevlar, to further improve on the mechanical properties toward those of individual CNTs.|$|E

40|$|It is {{commonly}} {{believed that the}} fracture toughness of a brittle material can be characterized by a single parameter such as the stress intensity factor. In this study, it was demonstrated that when the crack is highly constrained, the first nonsingular opening stress term at the crack tip, {{in addition to the}} K-field (the singular stress term), is necessary to predict fracture. Fracture experiments were conducted using plexiglass specimens with a center crack. Relatively rigid metallic end tabs were used to generate boundary constraints on the specimen. The level of constraint was varied by varying the <b>gage</b> <b>length</b> between the end tabs. For a given crack length, the fracture load increases as the <b>gage</b> <b>length</b> decreases. If the stress intensity factor is used to determine the corresponding fracture toughness of plexiglass, the experimental data would indicate that the fracture toughness decreases as the <b>gage</b> <b>length</b> decreases. This is equivalent to saying that the fracture toughness of a brittle material can be affected by boundary conditions. It was shown that this behavior {{is the result of a}} diminishing size of the K-dominance zone and that the stress intensity factor alone cannot fully capture the fracture force. A new constant parameter was introduced to account for the effect of the near-tip nonsingular stress field on fracture. 1...|$|E

More recently, the importance of environmental effects on fatigue {{has been shown to}} frequently overshadow the creep-fatigue interaction. As both creep and environmental effects are temperature and time dependent, the role of each is often difficult to separate. The topic of this thesis is the design and validation of an apparatus to study the interactions of environment and creep with fatigue damage at high temperature. The alloy 2 1 / 4 Cr - 1 Mo steel was selected for testing to validate the system as considerable creep-fatigue data exist on this alloy. Strain controlled fully reversed testing was conducted at temperatures of 482 ˚C (900 °F) and 538 °C (1000 °F). The results of the testing at 1 % total strain range agreed with published data from the same heat of material. Differences in results at 0. 5 % total strain range were, however, found to exist. The differences are believed to be due to different specimen geometries used by other studies.

In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the micromechanical mechanisms of argillaceous rocks under combined mechanical load and varying moisture, and observe very low strain rates of about 10 - 10 s- 1, i. e. about 10 - 4 per week, a specific optical setup for Digital Image Correlation (DIC) has been developed at the Solids Mechanics Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique.

The first one allows us to minimize the systematic DIC errors by choosing an optimal optical setup, including appropriate lens aperture and light source with small wavelength, in combination with a specific grey level interpolation method (bilinear, bicubic, biquintic) in DIC algorithms. The second procedure aims at reducing the errors induced by overall out-of-plane motions of the sample. This procedure makes use of a specifically designed optical microscope, which tracks the few tens of micrometers out-of-plane motions of the sample all along the several months lasting test, to compensate the magnification fluctuations which disturb the macroscopic measurements.

Bimetallic couplings with other metals were simulated with a potentiostat at plus and minus one volt {{with respect to a}} saturated standard calomel electrode (SCE). Baseline tests were conducted in air and sea water without applied potential.

40|$|Materials, {{including}} bone, {{often fail}} due to loading {{in the presence}} of critical flaws. The relative amount, location, and interaction of these flaws within a stressed volume of material play a role in determining the failure properties of the structure. As materials are generally imperfect, larger volumes of material have higher probabilities of containing a flaw of critical size than do smaller volumes. Thus, larger volumes tend to fail at fewer cycles compared with smaller volumes when fatigue loaded to similar stress levels. A material is said to exhibit a volume effect if its failure properties are dependent on the specimen volume. Volume effects are well documented in brittle ceramics and composites and have been proposed for bone. We hypothesized that (1) smaller volumes of cortical bone have longer fatigue lives than similarly loaded larger volumes and (2) that compared with microstructural features, specimen volume was able to explain comparable amounts of variability in fatigue life. In this investigation, waisted rectangular specimens (n= 18) with nominal cross-sections of 3 × 4 mm and <b>gage</b> <b>lengths</b> of 10. 5, 21, or 42 mm, were isolated from the mid-diaphysis of the dorsal region of equine third metacarpal bones.

The group having the smallest volume exhibited a trend of greater log fatigue life than the larger volume groups. Each volume group exhibited a significant positive correlation between the logarithm of fatigue life and the cumulative failure probability, indicating that the data follow the two-parameter Weibull distribution. Additionally, log fatigue life was negatively correlated with log volume, supporting the hypothesis that smaller stressed volumes of cortical bone possess longer fatigue lives than similarly tested larger stressed volumes...|$|R
