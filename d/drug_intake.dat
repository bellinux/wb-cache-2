There was physical fighting between members: Bell, after being {{punched in the}} face by Hummel, retaliated by smashing Hummel's new bass guitar to pieces against the wall. Hummel took revenge at a later date: finding Bell's acoustic guitar in the latter's unattended car, he repeatedly punched it with a screwdriver. In November 1972, Bell quit the band. When work continued on songs for a second album, Bell rejoined, but further conflict soon erupted. A master tape of the new songs inexplicably went missing, and Bell, whose heavy <b>drug</b> <b>intake</b> was affecting his judgment, attacked Fry's parked car.

This paper reports {{on the success of}} nutrition-based therapeutic approaches for improving the health and solving digestive troubles of a communicating-impaired and initially overweight patient. Symptoms include frequent burping, and diagnoses revealed hiatal hernia and stomach ulcers. Two different diet plans have been successively applied over one year. Each half-year diet impact has been home-monitored by measuring the body-mass data and index. Details on nutrition, supplement and <b>drug</b> <b>intakes,</b> as well as any observations were daily recorded. The first halfyear diet was based on gastroesophageal reflux preventing recommendations, whereas the 2 nd diet plan was elaborated from the metabolic typing and gluten intolerance information. Normal body mass index (BMI) values (20 - 25) were reached during the 1 st phase, which was marked by an increase in the intake of food supplement and a reduction in the frequency of <b>drug</b> <b>intakes,</b> especially from the 4 th month. After one-year of nutrition-based therapy, the patient health has been generally improved, and the hiatal hernia and ulcer problems have disappeared. A database containing all information recorded throughout the diet plans was created. During the patient body-mass loss, the muscle part increased whereas the fat part dropped. Such fat mass loss observed over the 1 st 4 months was possibly correlated to the intake frequency diminution of proton pump inhibitor, acting against the gastric acid secretion.

25|$|Each {{phenotype}} {{is based}} upon the allelic variation within the individual genotype. However, several genetic events can influence a same phenotypic trait, and establishing genotype-to-phenotype relationships can thus be far from consensual with many enzymatic patterns. For instance, the influence of the CYP2D6*1/*4 allelic variant on the clinical outcome in patients treated with Tamoxifen remains debated today. In oncology, genes coding for DPD, UGT1A1, TPMT, CDA involved in the pharmacokinetics of 5-FU/capecitabine, irinotecan, 6-mercaptopurine and gemcitabine/cytarabine, respectively, have all been described as being highly polymorphic.

25|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a common {{neurological}} disorder characterized by a degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra {{and a loss of}} dopamine in the putamen. It is described as a motor disease, but it also produces cognitive and behavioral symptoms. The most common treatment is dopamine replacement therapy, which consists in the administration of levodopa (L-Dopa) or dopamine agonists (such as pramipexole or ropinirole) to patients. Dopamine replacement therapy is well known to improve motor symptoms but its effects in cognitive and behavioral symptoms are more complex. Dopamine has been related to the normal learning of stimuli with behavioral and motivational significance, attention, and most importantly the reward system. In accordance with the role of dopamine in reward processing, addictive drugs stimulate dopamine release. Although the exact mechanism has yet to be elucidated, the role of dopamine in the reward system and addiction has been proposed as the origin of DDS. Models of addiction have been used to explain how dopamine replacement therapy produces DDS. One of these models of addiction proposes that over the usage course of a drug there is a habituation to the rewarding that it produces at the initial stages. This habituation is thought to be dopamine mediated. With long-term administration of L-dopa the reward system gets used to it and needs higher quantities. As the user increases <b>drug</b> <b>intake</b> there is a loss of dopaminergic receptors in the striatum which acts in addition to an impairment in goal-direction mental functions to produce an enhancement of sensitization to dopamine therapy. The behavioral and mood symptoms of the syndrome are produced by the dopamine overdose.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive {{behavioral}} {{therapy has}} been found to be more effective for the long-term management of insomnia than sedative hypnotic drugs. No formal withdrawal programs for benzodiazepines exists with local providers in the UK. Meta-analysis of published data on psychological treatments for insomnia show a success rate between 70 and 80%. A large-scale trial utilizing cognitive behavioral therapy in chronic users of sedative hypnotics including nitrazepam, temazepam, and zopiclone found CBT to be a significantly more effective long-term treatment for chronic insomnia than sedative hypnotic drugs. Persisting improvements in sleep quality, sleep onset latency, increased total sleep, improvements in sleep efficiency, significant improvements in vitality, physical and mental health at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups were found in those receiving CBT. A marked reduction in total sedative hypnotic drug use was found in those receiving CBT, with 33% reporting zero hypnotic drug use. Age {{has been found}} not to be a barrier to successful outcome of CBT. It was concluded that CBT for the management of chronic insomnia is a flexible, practical, and cost-effective treatment, and it was also concluded that CBT leads to a reduction of benzodiazepine <b>drug</b> <b>intake</b> in a significant number of patients. Chronic use of hypnotic medications is not recommended due to their adverse effects on health and the risk of dependence. A gradual taper is usual clinical course in getting people off of benzodiazepines, but, even with gradual reduction, a large proportion of people fail to stop taking benzodiazepines. The elderly are particularly sensitive to the adverse effects of hypnotic medications. A clinical trial in elderly people dependent on benzodiazepine hypnotics showed that the addition of CBT to a gradual benzodiazepine reduction program increased the success rate of discontinuing benzodiazepine hypnotic drugs from 38% to 77% and at the 12-month follow-up from 24% to 70%. The paper concluded that CBT is an effective tool for reducing hypnotic use in the elderly and reducing the adverse health effects that are associated with hypnotics such as drug dependence, cognitive impairments, and increased road traffic accidents.|$|E

Advantages and disadvantages of myoglobin determination are well known. Myoglobin is the earliest known, commercially available, biochemical marker of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and its rapid kinetics make it an early, good marker of reperfusion. However, since myoglobin is present in both skeletal and cardiac muscle, any damage to these muscle types results in its release into blood.

[...] Damage to the liver is not due to the drug itself but to a toxic metabolite (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI)) produced by cytochrome P-450 enzymes in the liver. In normal circumstances, this metabolite is detoxified by conjugating with glutathione in phase 2 reaction.

The cycloid psychosis has a long history in European psychiatry diagnosis. The term [...] "cycloid psychosis" [...] was first used by Karl Kleist 1926. Despite the significant clinical relevance, this diagnosis is neglected both in literature as in nosology. The cycloid psychosis has attracted much interest in the international literature of the past 50 years, but the number of scientific studies have greatly decreased over the past 15 years, possibly partly explained by the misconception that the diagnosis has been included incorporated in current diagnostic classification systems. The cycloid psychosis is therefore only partially described in the diagnostic classification systems used. [...] "polymorph acute psychotic disorder", with or without schizophrenic symptoms.

40|$|Purpose In the literature, {{noncompliance}} to medication {{in patients}} with schizophrenia ranges from 20 to 89 %. There is an urgent need for reliable and valid techniques that measure compliance in antipsychotic drug treatment. In this study, we use pharmacy-dispensing records to assess compliance by calculating the refill rate of antipsychotic medication. Methods Refill rates of chronic antipsychotic drug users in 1999 and in 2000 were established by dividing the number of prescribed days {{by the total number}} of calendar days that the patient was registered in a pharmacy prescription records database. Results More than 50 % of patients using an antipsychotic drug show a refill rate that is associated with medication compliance (0. 9 - 1. 1). The number of daily antipsychotic <b>drug</b> <b>intakes</b> was associated with a divergent refill rate, more than once daily dosing was associated with a significantly elevated refill rate (p < 0. 015). Conclusions The refill rate is a valuable addition to the small arsenal of objective compliance measurement tools. It is an easy to obtain and inexpensive way to estimate (non) compliance. We recommend future studies to medication use in both mental and physical disorders, in order to further specify the actual value of refill rates in clinical practice.

We also investigated if inequalities exist in physician’s choice on multisource oral solid hypoglycaemic and antihypertensive drugs in a sample of male type II diabetes mellitus patients with concurrent hypertension. Questionnaires were administered on patients (N= 500) with diabetes mellitus and concurrent hypertension to determine their SES, prescribed drugs, dietary regime and health behaviour in Lahore, Pakistan. Correlation was determined using chi-square test for category characteristics, Kruskall-Wallis or ANOVA for continuous data variables non-normal or normally distributed data, respectively. The patient’s SES was indicated by univariate like income, occupation, and education. Patients with high SES were more adherent to <b>drug,</b> dietary <b>intake</b> and health behaviour (χ 2 = 13. 16, p< 0. 001; 34. 71, p< 0. 0001; 79. 24, p< 0. 0001, respectively). Patients with lower SES were prescribed cheaper hypoglycaemic and antihypertensive alternatives than their richer counterparts (p< 0. 0001). Socioeconomic differentials exist within urban communities; these differentials have direct effects on healthcare delivery and patient health. _______________________________________________________________________________...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to report a new manifestation of acute stroke following antifibrinolytic agent administration in young women carrying heterozygosity for methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C 677 T. The study included two young women who developed an acute ischaemic stroke following three days of tranexamic acid administration for bleeding gynaecological disorders. Case 1, a 44 -year-old woman, presented left hemiplegia, mild dysarthria and anosognosia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed right ischaemic fronto-temporal lesion due to subocclusion of the right middle cerebral artery. Case 2, a 49 -year-old woman, developed aphasia and right hemiplegia. Neuroimaging showed left capsular and periventricular infarcts due to near occlusion of the left internal carotid artery. Thrombophilia screening, coagulation parameters, homocysteine testing, 12 -lead electrocardiography, and transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography were unremarkable. Genetic assay showed that both patients carried heterozygosity for MTHFR C 677 T, in which cytosine (C) is replaced by thymidine (T) at base position 677. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the association between genetic factors and the onset of stroke following antifibrinolytic <b>drugs</b> <b>intake.</b> These data suggest a synergic effect of plasminogen activator inhibitor and heterozygosity for MTHFR C 677 T on the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to ischaemic stroke in young people...|$|R
