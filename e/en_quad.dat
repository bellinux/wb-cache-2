50|$|Words in capitals {{must always}} be letter-spaced. The spacing of the capitals in lines of {{importance}} should be very carefully optically equalized. The word spaces in lines either of capitals or small capitals should not exceed an <b>en</b> <b>quad.</b>|$|E
50|$|For the {{numbering}} of footnotes use normal figures {{followed by}} a full point and an <b>en</b> <b>quad.</b> These figures may run either throughout the chapter, or even through the whole book, according to the special instructions given by the typographer.|$|E

5000|$|Compartments {{also held}} spacers, which are blocks of blank type used to {{separate}} words and {{fill out a}} line of type, such as em and <b>en</b> <b>quads</b> (quadrats, or spaces. A quadrat is a block of type whose face {{is lower than the}} printing letters so that it does not itself print.). An em space was the width of a capital letter [...] "M" [...] - as wide as it was high - while an en space referred to a space half the width of its height (usually the dimensions for a capital [...] "N").|$|R
50|$|In typography, a quad (originally quadrat) was a {{metal spacer}} used in {{letterpress}} typesetting. The term was later adopted as the generic name for two common sizes of spaces in typography, {{regardless of the}} form of typesetting used. An em quad is a space that is one em wide; {{as wide as the}} height of the font. An <b>en</b> <b>quad</b> is a space that is one en wide: half the width of an em quad.|$|E
