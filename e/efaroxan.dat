40|$|Ultra-low {{doses of}} alpha- 2 (α 2) -adrenoceptor antagonists augment spinal {{morphine}} antinociception and inhibit tolerance, but {{the role of}} receptor specificity in these actions is unknown. We used the stereo-isomers of the α 2 adrenoceptor antagonist, <b>efaroxan</b> to evaluate the effect of receptor specificity on the induction of spinal morphine tolerance and hyperalgesia. Tail flick and paw pressure tests were first used to evaluate high dose <b>efaroxan</b> (12. 6 μg) and its stereo-isomers on clonidine analgesia in intrathecally catheterized rats. Ultra-low doses of individual isomers (1. 3 ng) were then co-administered with morphine (15 μg) to determine their effects on acute antinociceptive tolerance and hyperalgesia induced by low dose spinal morphine (0. 05 ng). Results demonstrate that high dose (+) <b>efaroxan</b> antagonized clonidine-induced antinociception, while (-) <b>efaroxan</b> had minimal effect. In addition, an ultra-low dose of (+) <b>efaroxan</b> (1. 3 ng), substantially lower than required for receptor blockade, inhibited the development of acute morphine tolerance, while (-) <b>efaroxan</b> was less effective. Racemic (±) <b>efaroxan</b> effects {{were similar to those}} of (+) <b>efaroxan.</b> Furthermore, low dose morphine (0. 05 ng) produced sustained hyperalgesia in the tail flick test and this was blocked by co-injection of (+) but not (-) <b>efaroxan</b> (1. 3 ng). Given the isomer-specific <b>efaroxan</b> effects and their different receptor potencies, we suggest that inhibition of opioid tolerance by ultra-low dose <b>efaroxan</b> involves a specific interaction with spinal α 2 -adrenoceptors in this model. Likewise, inhibitory effects of adrenoceptor antagonists on morphine tolerance may be due to blockade of opioid-induced hyperalgesia. © 2013 Elsevier B. V...|$|E

40|$|When {{isolated}} rat islets were cultured for 18 [*]h {{prior to}} use, the putative imidazoline binding site ligand, RX 871024 caused a dose-dependent increase in insulin secretion at both 6 [*]mM and 20 [*]mM glucose. By contrast, a second ligand, <b>efaroxan,</b> was ineffective at 20 [*]mM glucose whereas it did stimulate insulin secretion {{in response to}} 6 [*]mM glucose. Exposure of islets to RX 871024 (50 [*]μM) for 18 [*]h, resulted in loss of responsiveness to this reagent upon subsequent re-exposure. However, islets that were unresponsive to RX 871024 still responded normally to <b>efaroxan.</b> The imidazoline antagonist, KU 14 R, blocked the insulin secretory response to <b>efaroxan,</b> but failed to prevent the stimulatory response to RX 871024. By contrast with its effects in cultured islets, RX 871024 inhibited glucose-induced insulin release from freshly isolated islets. <b>Efaroxan</b> did not inhibit insulin secretion under any conditions studied. In freshly isolated islets, the effects of RX 871024 on insulin secretion could be converted from inhibitory to stimulatory, by starvation of the animals. Inhibition of insulin secretion by RX 871024 in freshly isolated islets was prevented by the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors indomethacin or flurbiprofen. Consistent with this, RX 871024 caused a marked increase in islet PGE 2 formation. <b>Efaroxan</b> did not alter islet PGE 2 levels.

Tolbutamide stimulated insulin release at both nonstimulatory (1. 1 mM) and stimulatory (16. 7 mM) glucose. Under depolarizing conditions (16. 7 mM glucose plus 30 mM KCl) tolbutamide evoked a stepwise K(ATP) channel-independent insulinotropic response. Culture (18 h) with tolbutamide or the guanidine derivative BTS 67 582 (100 microM) markedly reduced (P < 0. 001) subsequent responsiveness to acute challenge with tolbutamide, glibenclamide, and BTS 67 582 but not the imidazoline drug, <b>efaroxan.</b> Conversely, 18 h culture with <b>efaroxan</b> reduced (P < 0. 001) subsequent insulinotropic effects of <b>efaroxan</b> but not that of tolbutamide, glibenclamide, or BTS 67 582.

40|$|Context Certain {{imidazoline}} drugs stimulate insulin secretion acutely {{but their}} longer term {{effects on the}} viability of pancreatic beta-cells are less well characterised. Indeed, some reports have suggested that imidazolines can be toxic to beta-cells while others have reported protective effects against other cytotoxic agents. Objective In order to address these discrepancies, the effects of two structurally related imidazolines, <b>efaroxan</b> and idazoxan, on the viability of clonal BRIN-BD 11 beta-cells, were compared. Design and main outcome measures BRIN-BD 11 cells were exposed to test reagents and their viability monitored by measuring cellular reducing ability and DNA fragmentation. Nitric oxide was measured indirectly via medium nitrite formation. Results <b>Efaroxan</b> (up to 100 µM) did not directly affect BRIN-BD 11 cell viability {{in the absence of}} other agents and it did not protect these cells against the cytotoxic effects of interleukin- 1 beta. Indeed, analysis of DNA fragmentation in BRIN-BD 11 cells revealed that <b>efaroxan</b> enhanced the level of damage caused by interleukin- 1 beta. Idazoxan caused a time- and dose-dependent loss of BRIN-BD 11 cell viability in the absence of other ligands. This was associated with marked DNA degradation but was not associated with formation of nitric oxide. The effects of idazoxan were insensitive to blockade of alpha 2 -adrenoceptors or 5 -HT 1 A (5 -hydroxytryptamine; serotonin) receptors. Conclusions The results confirm that idazoxan is cytotoxic to beta-cells but show that <b>efaroxan</b> is better tolerated. However, since <b>efaroxan</b> enhanced the cytotoxic effects of interleukin- 1 beta, it appears that this imidazoline may sensitise BRIN-BD 11 cells to the damaging effects of certain cytokines...|$|E
40|$|The {{contribution}} of ATP-sensitive K+ channel (KATP channel) -dependent and -independent signaling to the insulinotropic characteristics of imidazolines was explored using perifused mouse islets and -cells. Up to {{a concentration of}} 100 5 M <b>efaroxan</b> had no insulinotropic effect {{in the presence of}} a basal glucose concentration, but enhanced the effect of a stimulatory concentration of glucose or nonglucidic nutrients (ketoisocaproate plus glutamine). The secretion by a non-nutrient (40 mM KCl) was not enhanced. At 500 5 M, <b>efaroxan</b> stimulated insulin secretion when glucose was basal. Likewise, at 0. 1 to 10 5 M RX 871024 [2 -(imidazolin- 2 -yl) - 1 -phenylindole] showed a purely enhancing effect, but at 100 5 M it elicited a strong KCl-like secretory response in the presence of basal glucose. At 0. 1 and 1 5 M RX 871024 did not significantly depolarize the -cell membrane. However, at a purely enhancing drug concentration (10 5 M RX 871024 or 100 5 M <b>efaroxan)</b> KATP channel activity was strongly reduced, the membrane was depolarized, and the cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration was elevated in the presence of basal glucose. Insulin secretion by sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) 1 knockout (KO) islets, which have no functional KATP channels, was not increased by <b>efaroxan</b> (100 or 500 5 M) or by 10 5 M RX 871024 but was increased by 100 5 M RX 871024. The imidazolines phentolamine and alinidine (100 5 M) were also ineffective on SUR 1 KO islets. It is concluded that a significant KATP channel block is compatible with a purely enhancing effect of the imidazolines on nutrient-induced insulin secretion. Only RX 871024 has an additional, nondepolarizing effect, which at a high drug concentration is able to elicit a KATP channel-independent secretion...|$|E
40|$|Imidazoline binding {{sites have}} been {{reported}} to be present in the locus coeruleus (LC). To investigate the role of these sites in the control of LC neuron activity, we studied the effect of imidazolines using in vivo and in vitro single-unit extracellular recording techniques. In anaesthetized rats, local (27 pmoles) and systemic (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) administrations of 2 -(2 -benzofuranyl) - 2 -imidazoline (2 -BFI), a selective I-imidazoline receptor ligand, increased the firing rate of LC cells (maximal increase: 22 ± 5 %, P< 0. 001 and 16 ± 7 %, P< 0. 001 respectively). Chronic pretreatment with the irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor clorgyline (3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p., every 12 [*]h for 14 days) abolished this effect. In rat midpontine brain slices containing the LC, bath application (1 [*]mM) of the imidazolines 2 -BFI, 2 -(4, 5 -dihydroimidaz- 2 -yl) -quinoline (BU 224), idazoxan, <b>efaroxan,</b> phentolamine and (2 - 2 -methoxy- 1, 4 -benzodioxan- 2 -yl) - 2 -imidazoline (RX 821002) reversibly stimulated LC cells. The maximal effect was ∼ 90 % except for RX 821002 and <b>efaroxan</b> which induced smaller maximal effects (∼ 58 % and ∼ 35 % respectively). Simultaneous application of idazoxan and 2 BFI did not lead to additive effects. Bath application of the α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonists, yohimbine (1 – 10 [*]μM) and N-ethoxycarbonyl- 1, 2 -dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) (10 [*]μM), failed to modify LC activity. The irreversible blockade of α 2 -adrenoceptors with EEDQ (10 [*]μM) did not alter the effect of idazoxan or that of <b>efaroxan.</b> Previous application of clorgyline (10 [*]μM) did not modify the excitatory effect of 2 -BFI or <b>efaroxan.</b> Changes in the pH of the bathing solution (6. 84 – 7. 84) did not influence the effect caused by idazoxan. Bath application of 2 -BFI (1 [*]mM) reversed the inhibition induced by diazoxide (300 [*]μM), an ATP-sensitive K+ channel opener, whereas application of glibenclamide (3 [*]μM), an ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker, partially blocked the effect of 2 -BFI. This study shows that imidazoline compounds stimulate the firing rate of LC neurons. This effect is not mediated by α 2 -adrenoceptors nor by I 1 or I 2 -imidazoline receptors but involves a different subtype of imidazoline receptor.

40|$|Imidazoline α 2 -antagonist {{drugs such}} as <b>efaroxan</b> {{have been shown to}} {{increase}} the insulin secretory response to sulphonylureas from rat pancreatic B-cells. We have investigated whether this reflects binding to an islet imidazoline receptor or whether α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonism is involved. Administration of (±) -efaroxan or glibenclamide to Wistar rats was associated with a transient increase in plasma insulin. When both drugs were administered together, the resultant increase in insulin levels was much greater than that obtained with either drug alone. Use of the resolved enantiomers of <b>efaroxan</b> revealed that the ability of the compound to enhance the insulin secretory response to glibenclamide resided only in the α 2 -selective-(+) -enantiomer; the imidazoline receptor-selective-(−) -enantiomer was ineffective. In vitro, (+) -efaroxan increased the insulin secretory response to glibenclamide in rat freshly isolated and cultured islets of Langerhans, whereas (−) -efaroxan was inactive. By contrast, (+) -efaroxan did not potentiate glucose-induced insulin secretion but (−) -efaroxan induced a marked increase in insulin secretion from islets incubated in the presence of 6 [*]mM glucose. Incubation of rat islets under conditions designed to minimize the extent of α 2 -adrenoceptor signalling (by receptor blockade with phenoxybenzamine; receptor down-regulation or treatment with pertussis toxin) abolished the capacity of (+) -and (±) -efaroxan to enhance the insulin secretory response to glibenclamide. However, these manoeuvres did not alter the ability of (±) -efaroxan to potentiate glucose-induced insulin secretion. The results indicate that the enantiomers of <b>efaroxan</b> exert differential effects on insulin secretion which may result from binding to effector sites having opposite stereoselectivity. Binding of (−) -efaroxan (presumably to imidazoline receptors) results in potentiation of glucose-induced insulin secretion, whereas interaction of (+) -efaroxan with a second site leads to selective enhancement of sulphonylurea-induced insulin release...|$|E

In the present study, we investigated the effects of allantoin on HFD-induced obesity. The chronic administration of allantoin to HFD-fed mice for 8 weeks significantly decreased their body weight, and this effect was reversed by <b>efaroxan</b> at a dose sufficient to block I 1 R.

Moreover, allantoin lowered HFD-induced hyperleptinemia, and this activity was abolished by I 1 R blockade with <b>efaroxan.</b> Taken together, these data suggest that allantoin can ameliorate energy intake and eWAT accumulation by activating I 1 R to improve HFD-induced obesity...|$|E

In the present study, we investigated the effects of dexmedetomidine on human platelet functions in vitro. The effects of dexmedetomidine on platelet aggregation were examined using aggregometers. The formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in platelets was measured by an enzyme immunoassay. In addition, P-selectin expression in platelets was estimated by flow cytometry. We showed that dexmedetomidine enhances platelet aggregation. But in the presence of yohimbine, an α[2]-antagonist, dexmedetomidine suppressed platelet aggregation. <b>Efaroxan,</b> an I[1]-antagonist, and methylene blue, a soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor, abolished the suppressive effect of dexmedetomidine, whereas idazoxan, an I[2]-antagonist, showed no effect. Dexmedetomidine suppressed cAMP formation and enhanced P-selectin expression in platelets, and these effects were inhibited by yohimbine. Dexmedetomidine increased cGMP formation in platelets in the presence of yohimbine, and this increase was suppressed by <b>efaroxan.</b> These results demonstrated that dexmedetomidine has both enhancing and suppressive effects on human platelet functions through its action on the α[2]-adrenoceptor and on the I[1]-imidazoline receptor, respectively...|$|E

Its efficacy (8 fold over the basal value), which did not differ whatever the glucose concentration (stimulatory or not), was intermediate between that of sulphonylurea and that of <b>efaroxan.</b> Similarly to sulphonylureas and classical imidazolines, S- 22068 blocked KATP channels and, in turn, opened nifedipine-sensitive voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels, triggering Ca 2 + entry.

This paper explores the interaction of Kir 6. 2 with four imidazoline derivatives by using AutoDock and Gromacs programs. The docking results reveal that the binding sites of the four imidazolines are different from each other: Idazoxan lies in a polar active pocket formed by residues H 177, G 299 and R 301; while RX 871024 is situated in a hydrophobic pocket composed of residues F 168, M 169 and I 296; as for <b>Efaroxan</b> and Clonidine, residues H 175, R 177, K 67 and W 68 constitute the binding pocket. Based on the docking results, the four imidazoline/Kir 6. 2 complexes with explicit water and infinite lipid bilayer membrane were constructed to perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The results of MD calculation are as follows: dioleoyl phosphatidyl choline bilayer membrane stabilised the structure of these complexes through polar and nonpolar interaction; Idazoxan and RX 871024 are stably combined with Kir 6. 2 in their docking sites; <b>Efaroxan</b> has a minor change in contrast to the docking result; whereas Clonidine has an obvious change compared to docking conformation.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the protective activity of TVP 1022 and other propargyl derivatives involve the activation of p 42 / 44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. In the current study, we further investigated the molecular mechanism of action and signaling pathways of TVP 1022 which may account for the cyto/cardio-protective efficacy of the drug. Using specific receptor binding and enzyme assays, we demonstrated that the imidazoline 1 and 2 binding sites (I(1) & I(2)) are potential targets for TVP 1022 (IC(50)  = 9. 5 E- 08 M and IC(50)  = 1. 4 E- 07 M, respectively). Western blotting analysis showed that TVP 1022 (1 - 20 µM) dose-dependently increased the immunoreactivity of phosphorylated p 42 and p 44 MAPK in rat pheochromocytoma PC 12 cells and in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM). This effect of TVP 1022 was significantly attenuated by <b>efaroxan,</b> a selective I(1) imidazoline receptor antagonist. In addition, the cytoprotective effect of TVP 1022 demonstrated in NRVM against serum deprivation-induced toxicity was markedly inhibited by <b>efaroxan,</b> thus suggesting the importance of I(1) imidazoline receptor in mediating the cardioprotective activity of the drug.

Using the rabbit as an appropriate model {{for the study of}} this type of binding sites, we have tried to re-evaluate the effects of idazoxan, the selective I 2 compound BU 224, and <b>efaroxan</b> on insulin secretion. Mimicking <b>efaroxan,</b> idazoxan and BU 224 potentiated insulin release from perifused islets in the presence of 8 mM glucose. In static incubation, insulin secretion induced by idazoxan and BU 224 exhibited both dose and glucose dependencies. ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel blockade, though at a different site from the SUR 1 receptor, with subsequent Ca 2 + entry, mediates the insulin releasing effect of the three ligands. However, additional MAO independent intracellular steps in stimulus- secretion coupling linked to PKA and PKC activation are only involved in the effect of BU 224. Therefore, both an I 2 related binding site at the channel level shared by the three ligands and a putative I 3 -intracellularly located binding site stimulated by BU 224 would be mediating insulin release by these compounds.

We hypothesized that the hypotensive and renal actions of moxonidine may be mediated by atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), a cardiac peptide involved in pressure and volume homeostasis through its vasodilatory, diuretic, and natriuretic actions. Renal parameters were measured on an hourly basis {{over a period of}} 4 hours in conscious rats that received bolus intravenous injections of moxonidine (1 to 150 mg/ 300 mL saline). During the first hour, moxonidine dose-dependently stimulated diuresis, natriuresis, kaliuresis, and urinary cGMP, the index of ANP activity. Moxonidine (50 mg) significantly (P, 0. 001) stimulated urinary volume (0. 3560. 04 versus 1. 0560. 09 mL/h per 100 g), sodium (14. 362. 5 versus 51. 866. 5 mmol/h per 100 g), potassium (10. 562. 3 versus 32. 363. 2 mmol/h per 100 g), and cGMP (325652 versus 7446120 pmol/h per 100 g).

Exposure for 18 h to 100 μM nateglinide abolished the acute insulinotropic effects of 200 μM nateglinide, tolbutamide or glibenclamide, but had no effect upon the insulinotropic effect of 200 μM <b>efaroxan.</b> While 18 h exposure to 100 μM nateglinide did not affect basal insulin release or insulin release {{in the presence of}} 16. 7 mM glucose, 25 μM forskolin or 10 nM PMA, significant inhibition of the insulinotropic effects of 20 mM leucine and 20 mM arginine were observed.

The maintained insulinotropic effects of this drug with increasing glucose concentrations support the antihyperglycaemic actions of nateglinide in Type II diabetes. Studies of the long-term effects of nateglinide indicate that nateglinide shares signalling pathways with sulphonylureas, but not the imidazoline <b>efaroxan.</b> This may be significant when considering a nateglinide treatment regimen, particularly in patients previously treated with sulphonylurea...|$|E

Relaxation of the preparation was measured as a function of concentration of 2 -(benzofuranyl) - 2 -imidazoline (2 -BFI), a specific imidazoline I 2 receptor ligand, cirazoline, a potent I 2 receptor ligand and � 1 -adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine, an agonist of � 1 -adrenoceptor, moxonidine, a ligand of I 1 receptor, <b>efaroxan,</b> a ligand of I 3 receptor and 5 -bromo- 6 -(imidazoline- 2 -yl-amino) quinoxaline (UK 14304), an agonist of � 2 -adrenoceptor. Next, the effects of a series of imidazolineand/or �-adrenoceptor-binding drugs (prazosin, yohimbine, RS 79948, RX 821002, idazoxan and <b>efaroxan)</b> on the relaxation of the Ach-constricted rat jejunum strips, induced by 2 -BFI, cirazoline or phenylephrine, were studied. The obtained results demonstrate the involvement of the postsynaptic imidazoline receptors in rat jejunum motility. These receptors are of I 2 subtype and are linked to �-adrenoceptors of the predominantly � 1 subtype. The � 1 receptors dominate functionally over the I 2 in the isolated rat jejnum. The proposed model might be useful in search for more specific new drugs.

40|$|Dexmedetomidine is {{a potent}} and highly {{selective}} α 2 -adrenoceptor agonist with sedative, analgesic, and sympatholytic properties, though it also exhibits some affinity for imidazoline binding sites. In addition to its sedative effects, dexmedetomidine exerts neuroprotective effects under ischemic conditions. Invasive incidents such as ischemia or hypoxia induce dysfunctions in energy production or depletion of ATP as well as accumulation and aggregation of abnormal proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to an ER-stress response. In the present study, we examined whether dexmedetomidine exerts inhibitory effects on apoptosis mediated by thapsigargin-induced ER-stress in SH-SY 5 Y cells, and proposed a possible underlying mechanism for its neuroprotective effects. We used thapsigargin (TG) to generate an ER-stress response in SH-SY 5 Y cells. SH-SY 5 Y cells were pretreated with Dex (1 – 1000 nM) or receptor antagonists (atipamezole, <b>efaroxan,</b> BU 99006, and 2 ’, 5 ’-dideoxyadenosine) for 1 hour before co-treatment with 1 mM TG for 20 hours. Co-incubation with dexmedetomidine suppressed thapsigargin-induced increases in cytosolic Ca 2 +, caspase- 4 and - 3 activity, eIF 2 α phosphorylation, and expression of ER-stress biomarkers. Dexmedetomidine treatment also decreased cAMP levels. In the presence of atipamezole or <b>efaroxan,</b> but not BU 99006, inhibition of eIF 2 α phosphorylation and CHOP expression significantly increased following treatment with dexmedetomidine in thapsigargin-treated cells. However, pretreatment with BU 99006 enhanced the increase in mitochondrial membrane potential associated with dexmedetomidine treatment. The {{results of the present}} study demonstrate that dexmedetomidine at clinically relevant concentrations suppresses ER-stress-induced apoptosis in SH-SY 5 Y cells. Some neuroprotective effects of dexmedetomidine may be mediated by α 2 -adrenoceptor and I 1 - and I 2 -receptors...|$|E

40|$|IntroductionAltered adiponectin {{signaling}} {{has been}} proposed as {{a key factor in}} the development of metabolic syndrome. We previously showed that one imidazoline I 1 receptor (I 1 R) ligand, LNP 509, can improve insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance partly through increased adiponectin plasma level. The objective {{of this study was to}} explore direct actions of I 1 R ligands on adipocytes. MethodsExperiments were carried out in primary adipocytes isolated from the epididymal white adipose tissue of aged male Wistar rats. Expression of I 1 R on adipocytes was verified with binding assays. I 1 R ligand effect was evaluated by treating adipocytes with increasing concentrations of LNP 509 ±I 1 R antagonist <b>efaroxan</b> (10 - 4 M). To identify the intracellular signaling pathways involved in the action of LNPs, wortmannin (PI 3 K-inhibitor), IBMX (phosphodiesterase blocker) and AS 1842856 (FOXO 1 inhibitor) were added 45 min prior LNP 509 exposure. After 3 h, adiponectin content was measured in the culture medium by ELISA assay. ResultsCompetition binding assays confirmed the expression of I 1 R in adipocyte membrane. Treatment by LNP 509 dose-dependently induced adiponectin secretion: from 18 ± 5 ng/ml at 10 - 9 M to 66 ± 15 ng/ml at 10 - 4 M; p≤ 0. 05 vs medium alone (25 ng/ml). The adiponectin secretion induced by the highest LNP 509 concentration was similar to the one elicited by 10 μM insulin (61 ng/ml); the secretion was totally prevented by a pretreatment with <b>efaroxan</b> (10 - 4 M). The LNP 509 -induced adipokine secretion was unchanged by wortmannin, but was reduced after phosphodiesterase and FOXO 1 blockade (- 80 % and - 44 % respectively, compared to LNP 509 alone). ConclusionLNP 509, through I 1 R, promotes adiponectin secretion by inhibiting cAMP and SIRT 1 /FOXO 1 pathways. These effects could lead to PPARγ activation in order to promote adiponectin synthesis. Future studies should confirm the proposed signaling pathways...|$|E
40|$|The {{agonists}} of imidazoline I- 1 receptors (I- 1 R) {{are widely}} used to lower blood pressure. It has been indicated that guanidinium derivatives show an ability to activate imidazoline receptors. Also, allantoin has a chemical stricture similar to guanidinium derivatives. Thus, it is of special interest to characterize the effect of allantoin on I- 1 R. In conscious male spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHRs), mean blood pressure (MBP) was recorded using the tail-cuff method. Furthermore, the hemodynamic analyses in catheterized rats were applied to measure the actions of allantoin in vivo. Allantoin decreased blood pressures in SHRs at 30 minutes, as the most effective time. Also, this antihypertensive action was shown in a dose-dependent manner from SHRs treated with allantoin. Moreover, in anesthetized rats, allantoin inhibited cardiac contractility and heart rate as showing in hemodynamic dP/dt max significantly. Also, the peripheral blood flow was markedly increased by allantoin. Both actions were diminished by <b>efaroxan</b> at the dose sufficient to block I- 1 R. Thus, we suggest that allantoin, as I- 1 R agonist, {{has the potential to}} develop as a new therapeutic agent for hypertension in the future...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} a rat brain extract {{containing}} clonidine-displacing substance (CDS), a putative endogenous imidazoline receptor ligand, on insulin release from rat and human isolated islets of Langerhans were investigated. CDS was able to potentiate the insulin secretory response of rat islets incubated at 6 [*]mM glucose, in a dose-dependent manner. The magnitude of this effect {{was similar to that}} in response to the well-characterized imidazoline secretagogue, <b>efaroxan.</b> CDS, like other imidazoline secretagogues, was also able to reverse the inhibitory action of diazoxide on glucose-induced insulin release, in both rat and human islets. These effects of CDS on secretion were reversed by the imidazoline secretagogue antagonists, RX 801080 and the newly defined KU 14 R, providing the first evidence that imidazoline-mediated actions of CDS can be blocked by specific imidazoline antagonists. The effects of CDS on insulin secretion were unaffected when the method of preparation involved centri-filtration through a 3, 000 [*]Da cut-off membrane or when the extract was treated with protease. These results confirm that the active principle is of low molecular weight and is not a peptide. Overall, the data suggest that CDS behaves as a potent endogenous insulin secretagogue acting at the islet imidazoline receptor...|$|E

Specific binding represented greater than 90 % of total binding.

40|$|A novel ATP-sensitive {{potassium}} channel (K(ATP)) channel agonist, BPDZ 154 (6, 7 -dichloro- 3 -isopropylamino- 4 H- 1, 2, 4 -benzothiadiazine 1, 1 -dioxide), was synthesized, {{and its effects}} on insulin-secreting cells were evaluated using electrophysiology, (86) Rb(+) and (45) Ca(2 +) efflux, and RIA determinations of insulin secretion. BPDZ 154, an analog of diazoxide, inhibited both glucose-induced insulin secretion from isolated perifused islets and the secretion of insulin induced by glucose and tolbutamide. These effects were mediated by the activation of ATP-sensitive {{potassium channel}}s because BPDZ 154 induced a concentration-dependent increase in channel activity that was inhibited by the sulfonylurea tolbutamide and the imidazoline <b>efaroxan.</b> In beta-cells isolated from patients with either nontypical hyperinsulinism (preserved K(ATP) channel function) or from the control areas of the pancreas of patients with focal hyperinsulinism, BPDZ 154 activated K(ATP) channels and was found to be more effective and less readily reversible than diazoxide. By contrast, {{it was not possible to}} activate K(ATP) channels by either diazoxide or BPDZ 154 in beta-cells from patients with hyperinsulinism as a consequence of defects in K(ATP) channel function. In beta-cells isolated from a patient with pancreatic insulinoma, K(ATP) channels were readily recorded and modulated by BPDZ 154. These data suggest that BPDZ 154 or BPDZ 154 -like compounds may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of certain forms of hyperinsulinism. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

40|$|The {{quality control}} of chiral drugs {{requires}} {{the determination of}} their enantiomeric purity. Nowadays, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy is gaining increasing importance in pharmaceutical analysis because of the commercially available CD detector in liquid chromatography. The separation of the two enantiomers of a basic drug (<b>efaroxan)</b> was achieved by high performance liquid chromatography using an amylose-derivated column with both UV and CD detections. A baseline-resolved separation (resolution: 5) was obtained after optimization of the mobile phase composition with hexane-ethanol-diethylamine (90 : 10 : 0. 05; v/v/v). The use of a commercial low-pass electronic noise filter of the CD signal has improved the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor twelve and allowed the quantitation of each enantiomer in the 1. 25 - 300 g ml- 1 concentration range.

40|$|Prolonged {{stimulation}} of insulin secretion by depolar-ization and Ca 2 influx regularly {{leads to a}} reversible state of decreased secretory responsiveness to nutrient and nonnutrient stimuli. This state is termed “desensi-tization. ” The onset of desensitization may occur within 1 h of exposure to depolarizing stimuli. Desensitization by exposure to sulfonylureas, imidazolines, or quinine produces a marked cross-desensitization against other ATP-sensitive K channel (KATP channel) -blocking secretagogues. However, desensitized -cells do not necessarily show changes in KATP channel activity or Ca 2 handling. Care {{has to be taken}} to distinguish desensitization-induced changes in signaling from ef-fects due to the persisting presence of secretagogues. The desensitization by depolarizing secretagogues is mostly accompanied by a reduced content of immunore-active insulin and a marked reduction of secretory granules in the -cells. In vitro recovery from a desen-sitization by the imidazoline <b>efaroxan</b> was nearly com-plete after 4 h. At this time point the depletion of the granule content was partially reversed. Apparently, re-covery from desensitization affects the whole lifespan of a granule from biogenesis to exocytosis. There is, however, no direct relation between the -cell granule content and the secretory responsiveness. Even though a prolonged exposure of isolated islets to depolarizing secretagogues is often associated with the occurrence of ultrastructural damage to -cells, we could not find a cogent link between depolarization and Ca 2 influx and apoptotic or necrotic -cell death.

40|$|We {{developed}} a novel, pure glucose-dependent, insulinotropic imidazoline compound, BL 11282, which directly affects the insulin exocytotic machinery {{and does not}} block the KATP channel activity. BL 11282 does not induce insulin secretion at basal glucose concentrations, whereas it stimulates insulin secretion at an elevated glucose level. Therefore this imidazoline should not provoke hypoglycemic episodes {{as it has been}} observed for the sulfonylureas. However, so far, the detailed biochemical and pharmacological mechanisms underlying the insulinotropic effects of BL 11282 are not fully established. The overall objective {{of this study was to}} investigate signaltransduction pathways involved in the pure glucose-dependent activity of BL 11282 on insulin release. Using SUR 1 (-/-) mice, we unambiguously confirmed the previous notion that the insulinotropic activity of BL 11282 is unrelated to its interaction with ATPdependent K+ channels. We have also shown that previously described targets for imidazoline compounds like alpha 2 -adrenoreceptors, imidazoline I 1 -receptors and monomeric G-protein Rhes are not involved in the mechanisms of the insulinotropic action of BL 11282. To clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of BL 11282 on insulin secretion, we have used an approach involving desensitization of beta-cells to the insulinotropic activity of BL 11282 by prolonged incubation with the compound. The data obtained show that overnight pretreatment of pancreatic islets with BL 11282 desensitizes the subsequent islet response to this imidazoline. Islets pretreated for the same time with <b>efaroxan,</b> another insulinotropic imidazoline, are unresponsive to subsequent addition of <b>efaroxan</b> but preserve their response to BL 11282. The effect of pretreatment with BL 11282 is accompanied by an increased insulinotropic response to subsequent high glucose concentration. Desensitization of islet response to BL 11282 does not eliminate subsequent islet response to GLP- 1, but significantly decreases the fold potentiation of insulin release by this peptide. The latter effect points to the importance of GLP- 1 stimulated signal-transduction pathways for the insulinotropic activity of BL 11282. Our results support the involvement of the cAMP-GEFII·Rim 2 pathway in BL 11282 stimulated insulin secretion. Indeed, expression of dominant negative cAMP-GEFII and Rim 2 mutant proteins in MIN 6 cells lead to a significant reduction in insulin secretion stimulated by the imidazoline. To further investigate this direct mechanism of BL 11282 on insulin release, we turned our attention to calcium-independent PLA 2 isoform iPLA 2 beta, which is predominantly expressed in pancreatic islets and plays an important role in insulin secretion in pancreatic islets. Our observations indicate a deficiency in iPLA 2 beta isoform expression in diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat islets compared to Wistar rat islets, this effect being in agreement with an impairment in the glucose-stimulated insulin response in GK rat islets. Pharmacological inhibition of iPLA 2 and cytochrome P- 450 enzymes completely abolished the insulinotropic effect of BL 11282. BL 11282 stimulated arachidonic acid release from the islets in the presence of high glucose concentration and this effect was fully blocked by iPLA 2 inhibitor, bromoenol lactone. The data suggest that potentiation of glucose-induced insulin release by BL 11282, independent of concomitant changes in cytoplasmic free Ca 2 + concentration, involves the release of arachidonic acid by iPLA 2 and its metabolism to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids through the cytochrome P- 450 pathway...|$|E
40|$|The {{pancreatic}} beta-cell expresses an imidazoline-binding {{site that}} {{is involved in}} the regulation of insulin secretion. This site is pharmacologically atypical in comparison with the I- 1 and I- 2 sites described in other tissues, and it has been classified as I- 3. The structural requirements for binding of ligands to the I- 3 site have not been fully defined, although a range of synthetic I- 3 ligands have been characterized in functional terms. Evidence has been presented that an endogenous I- 3 ligand may exist, because extracts of brain contain an active principle that stimulates insulin secretion {{in a manner consistent with}} the involvement of I- 3 sites. The active component has not been identified but has been equated with the long-sought clonidine displacing substance (CDS) that is proposed as the endogenous ligand for imidazoline-binding sites. Recent evidence has indicated that one active component of CDS may be a beta-carboline, but it is not known whether beta-carbolines can stimulate insulin secretion. Thus, we have studied the effects of beta-carbolines on insulin secretion and cytosolic Ca 2 + levels in rodent and human islet cells. The results reveal that harmane, pinoline, and norharmane cause a dose- and glucose-dependent increase in insulin secretion but show that this response differs in a number of ways from that elicited by the well-characterized I- 3 -agonist, <b>efaroxan.</b> Thus, beta-carbolines represent a new class of insulin secretagogues, although it remains unclear whether their action is mediated solely by I- 3 sites in the beta cell...|$|E
40|$|The hypotensive {{effect of}} imidazoline-like drugs, such as clonidine, was first {{attributed}} to the exclusive stimulation of central α 2 -adrenoceptors (α 2 ARs).

This work aims (i) to check whether imidazoline-like drugs with no α 2 -adrenergic agonist activity may alter blood pressure (BP) and (ii) to seek a possible interaction between such a drug and an α 2 ARs agonist α-methylnoradrenaline (α-MNA). We selected S 23515 and S 23757, two imidazoline-like drugs with negligible affinities and activities at α 2 ARs but with high affinities for non-adrenergic imidazoline binding sites (IBS). S 23515 decreased BP dose-dependently (− 27 ± 5 % maximal effect) when administered intracisternally (i. c.) to anaesthetized rabbits. The hypotension induced by S 23515 (100 [*]μg[*]kg− 1 i. c.) was prevented by S 23757 (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 i. c.) and <b>efaroxan</b> (10 [*]μg[*]kg− 1 i. c.), while these compounds, devoid of haemodynamic action by themselves, did not alter the hypotensive effect of α-MNA (3 and 30 [*]μg[*]kg− 1 i. c.).
