50|$|<b>Individual</b> <b>amnesty</b> is {{the most}} limited level of protection. This level protects {{individuals}} who are seeking medical attention for themselves {{as a result of}} an illegal action. <b>Individual</b> <b>amnesty</b> does not extend to organizations that person may be a part of or peers also present with the individual at that time.|$|E
50|$|Amnesty {{for victims}} offers more {{protection}} than <b>individual</b> <b>amnesty,</b> as it protects individuals requiring medical attention {{regardless of whether}} it was the victim or another party who sought help. Victim amnesty does not address the sanctions possible for violating parties besides the victim.|$|E
50|$|These policies, {{also known}} as Good Samaritan policies, protects {{individuals}} who call for another person seeking medical attention {{as a result of}} an illegal action. Liability protection in medical amnesty policies can often extend to those seeking help regardless if they are the one who is given medical assistance. This policy builds on <b>individual</b> <b>amnesty</b> but does not guarantee protection from legal prosecution for an organization the persons are a part of or attending. See also Good Samaritan law.|$|E

500|$|Mandela {{oversaw the}} {{formation}} of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate crimes committed under apartheid by both the government and the ANC, appointing Tutu as its chair. To prevent the creation of martyrs, the Commission granted <b>individual</b> <b>amnesties</b> in exchange for testimony of crimes committed during the apartheid era. Dedicated in February 1996, it held two years of hearings detailing rapes, torture, bombings, and assassinations, before issuing its final report in October 1998. Both de Klerk and Mbeki appealed to have parts of the report suppressed, though only de Klerk's appeal was successful. Mandela praised the Commission's work, stating that it [...] "had helped us move away from the past to concentrate on the present and the future".|$|R

50|$|Tildy {{served as}} the first President of the Republic of Hungary until July 31, 1948, when {{he was forced to}} resign after {{allegations}} emerged about his son-in-law being arrested for corruption and adultery. Tildy was held under house arrest in Budapest until 1 May 1956. He was appointed to the position of a state minister in the coalition government during the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. He was eventually arrested by Soviet forces after the revolution was crushed by Warsaw Pact intervention. On June 15, 1958, Tildy was sentenced by the Supreme Court to six years' imprisonment, in the trial of Imre Nagy and associates. However, he was released under an <b>individual</b> <b>amnesty</b> in April 1959 in view of his advanced years (in fact due to illness). He then lived in complete retirement until he died in Budapest on August 4, 1961.|$|E
40|$|Since Antiquity, the {{granting}} of amnesty to past atrocities has played {{a prominent role in}} political transitions. However, the moralized discourse of human rights that has emerged {{after the end of the}} Second World War has called for prosecutions in such cases. This study shows that granting individual amnesties to those responsible for past atrocities, as opposed to their prosecution, is a critical element in paving the way towards homonoia [...] -harmony or concord [...] -in a community that has been affected by civil strife. After having explored the origins of amnesty in Ancient Athens and its similarities with the amnesties granted by early modern European peace treaties and the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the author argues that <b>individual</b> <b>amnesty</b> constitutes the only way of uncovering the truth about past atrocities. This is turn facilitates the forgiving of perpetrators and thus the achievement of homonoia. Moreover, <b>individual</b> <b>amnesty,</b> as mainly a political act, can nevertheless encompass considerations of justice, when the notion is not restricted merely to its punitive aspect...|$|E

50|$|Allegations of {{war crimes}} in the 2006 Lebanon War refer to claims of various groups and <b>individuals,</b> {{including}} <b>Amnesty</b> International, Human Rights Watch, and United Nations officials, who accused both Hezbollah and Israel of violating international humanitarian law during the 2006 Lebanon War, and warned of possible war crimes. These allegations included intentional attacks on civilian populations or infrastructure, disproportionate or indiscriminate attacks, the use of human shields, {{and the use of}} prohibited weapons.|$|R
5000|$|Between September 2003 and April 2004, the RIAA, {{through its}} Clean Slate Program, offered <b>individual</b> file sharers <b>amnesty</b> for past infringements, [...] "on the {{condition}} that they refrain from future infringement," [...] and delete the infringing material. Individuals were no longer eligible for amnesty once they had been sued. The program is now discontinued.|$|R
50|$|Widespread notoriety {{has meant}} {{the game has}} had a {{colourful}} and, at times, troubled history. Its initial release was met with a barrage of criticism, particularly from the tabloid press. Other businesses refused {{to be associated with}} the game and it was also banned from a number of industry fairs around the world. The British police even confiscated it at one point. More recently, however, opinion has turned around and War on Terror is now praised by various highly respected institutions and <b>individuals,</b> among them <b>Amnesty</b> International and John Pilger.|$|R
5000|$|On 15 December 2003, the Chinese Ministry of Public Security {{issued a}} list of [...] "East Turkestan terrorists" [...] and [...] "terrorist {{organizations}}" [...] which named four organizations and several individuals: the East Turkestan Liberation Organization (ETLO), the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), the World Uyghur Youth Congress (WUYC) and the East Turkestan Information Centre (ETIC).At the same time, the official Chinese press initiated a campaign detailing [...] "terrorist" [...] incidents allegedly {{carried out by the}} <b>individuals</b> listed. <b>Amnesty</b> International regarded these allegations [...] "uncorroborated and no credible evidence was provided to substantiate these claims. Indeed, much of the [...] "evidence" [...] appeared to have been obtained from other individuals under interrogation. In view of the ongoing and widespread use of torture and ill-treatment by police in China, particularly to extract [...] "confessions" [...] from detained suspects, Amnesty International believes any [...] "evidence" [...] obtained in this way must be treated with deep suspicion." [...] In January, Hazret, who avoids public appearances, called into Radio Free Asia to respond that ETLO wishes to work by peaceful means, but spoke of the [...] "inevitability" [...] of a military wing targeting the Chinese government. He also stated that the principal goal of the ETLO was to pursue independence through peaceful means, and denied any participation in terrorist activities or connections to the East Turkestan Islamic Movement.Amnesty International has criticized the Chinese government response to ETLO, which it says include human rights violations, such as torture and ill-treatment by police.|$|R
5000|$|Approximately 7,000 <b>individuals</b> {{applied for}} <b>amnesty,</b> but only 10 percent {{received}} it. Those who violated {{human rights and}} followed the criteria did receive it. The criteria not only include individuals to fully admit their crimes, but to prove they were politically motivated. Those who supported the hybrid truth commission hoped it would heal the wounds of the past, give dignity to victims, and permit {{the emergence of a}} post-apartheid [...] "rainbow nation" [...] led by Nelson Mandela. To further heal the wounds, the commission recommended that there be a “wealth tax”, which would punish those who gained from apartheid, but South Africa never followed through. South Africa has not formally inserted any reparation programs. Also, with South Africa being the first to mandate a truth and reconciliation commission, it has become a model for other countries. Commissions have been widespread in the aftermath of conflict as components of peace agreements in Africa since the 1990. For example, Congo and Sierra Leone have used truth commissions.|$|R
