5|$|The game's sound team {{consisted}} of ten people: five handling general sound design, and five handling music composition. Hajime Wakai acted as the game's sound director and lead composer, {{with the other}} composers being Shiho Fujii, Mahito Yokota, and Takeshi Hama. Longtime series composer Koji Kondo had a supervisory role, only composing a single piece by himself: the music accompanying the prologue video describing the mythical origins of Demise and Hylia. He also helped in arranging the other composer's pieces, using an electric piano and a Mac computer. Fujii {{was responsible for the}} music focused on environments, dungeons, boss battles: among her work was the music for Skyloft. She used art and <b>environmental</b> <b>assets</b> so that her compositions would fit in with their environments. A first for the Zelda series, the music was performed using a live orchestra rather than synthesized instruments. It was the first time Nintendo EAD had used a live orchestra. Any previous orchestral elements in Twilight Princess, which amounted only to one track, were handled by their Tokyo division. Due to his experience, the department's musical lead Yokota was brought on to help orchestrate the score. Aonuma initially did not think of using an orchestra, and was still sure the score would remain synthesized even after Wakai asked him about it. An orchestra was finally chosen after Miyamoto insisted upon it, a decision which surprised the entire team.|$|E

Because the watershed is in one of the largest protected wilderness areas in the United States, the natural water filtration process remains intact.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a financial hedging model for global environment risks. Our approach {{is based on}} portfolio insurance under hedging constraints.

40|$|We {{present an}} optimal {{endogenous}} growth model with an <b>environmental</b> <b>asset</b> which delivers a direct social utility value. The {{efficiency of the}} production services provided by the <b>environmental</b> <b>asset</b> directly depend on past capital accumulation. Such an assumption corresponds to assuming that past capital accumulation embodies new technologies requiring lower and lower environmental pressure per unit of output. We show that a sustainable balanced growth, where output and capital both grow at a constant positive rate, and the <b>environmental</b> <b>asset</b> remains constant over time, exists, is unique and is saddle-point stable. We discuss {{the implications of the}} optimal balanced growth path for environmental policy and show that emission taxes can be used to support subsidies on capital required to make the competitive endogenous growth rate equal to the socially optimal growth rate...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} an economy where welfare of {{a continuum of}} (identical) agents depends on three goods: leisure, a free access renewable <b>environmental</b> <b>asset</b> and a produced good which can be consumed or saved to accumulate physical capital.

In this context, we show that indeterminacy and oscillating behavior may arise...|$|R
500|$|The Angel of Darkness was {{unveiled}} under its official name in March 2002, with a fuller demonstration appearing at E3 that year. Problems {{with the game}} were sensed at an early stage, as Heath-Smith forgot himself and began swearing at the game while trying to demonstrate the opening level at a buyer's conference. A release date was announced for November 2002, but the game got delayed into spring 2003. Eidos believed The Angel of Darkness would benefit from additional marketing support from , the sequel to the [...] Despite the delays, the company pushed Core Design to release the game {{in time for the}} marketing support. In order to meet the deadline, areas of the game containing key narrative elements had to be cut; one of the losses was the explanation of how the character survived the events of The Last Revelation. Among other concepts that needed to be cut were two further locations, character animations, sound bites, and unique gameplay elements involving Kurtis. Some completed <b>environmental</b> <b>assets</b> also ended up being cut by mistake. Some of those elements were also deliberately left out by the team, who wished to bring them into future games. The team at Core Design later said that they felt Eidos forced them to get the game out before it was ready. The game was also reportedly submitted eight times to Sony before its release. The game went gold on 18 June 2003, two days before its original release date, although there was some confusion as the game had reportedly gone gold on 2 June. The game was finally released in the summer of 2003, alongside The Cradle of Life.|$|E

Generational accounting is a method for measuring redistribution of lifetime tax burdens across generations from social insurance, including social security and social health insurance. It has been proposed as a better guide to the sustainability of a fiscal policy than budget deficits, which reflect only taxes minus spending in the current year. Environmental or green national accounting is the method of valuing <b>environmental</b> <b>assets,</b> which are usually not counted in measuring national wealth, {{in part due to}} the difficulty of valuing them. The method has been proposed as an alternative to an implied zero valuation of <b>environmental</b> <b>assets</b> and as a way of measuring the sustainability of welfare levels in the presence of environmental degradation.|$|E
