40|$|COASTAL ZONE REGULATION IN ITALY AND SPAIN: PROBLEMS, REFORMS, PERSPECTIVES Italian {{coastal zone}} {{regulation}} presents many problems, in particular concerning beach concessions. The main problems are: distribution of administrative responsibilities between {{different levels of}} government, selection procedures for the concession, quantification and <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> of concession <b>fees,</b> coastal planning (also {{from the point of}} view of the Integrated Coastal Zone Management), illegal construction. In this regard, a comparison with the Spanish coastal zone regulation is very interesting, such as in the case of the transferability inter vivos of the concessions, recently established by the reform of the Spanish Coastal Act. The Italian regulation has been also object of an EU infringement procedure, which has imposed a pro-competitive regulation. In a national context characterized by the existence of strong pressures and interests on the legislator, a larger use of selection procedures in beach concessions has been required and the abolition of privileges for concessionaires (such as the so-called “diritto di insistenza” or the automatic renewal of concessions) has been imposed...|$|R
50|$|In a hedge fund, the <b>management</b> <b>fee</b> is {{calculated}} {{as a percentage}} of the fund's net asset value (the total of the investors' capital accounts) at the time when the <b>fee</b> becomes payable. <b>Management</b> <b>fees</b> typically range from 1% to 4% per annum, with 2% being the standard figure. Therefore, if a fund has $1 billion of assets at year-end and charges a 2% <b>management</b> <b>fee,</b> the <b>management</b> <b>fee</b> will be $20 million. <b>Management</b> <b>fees</b> are usually expressed as an annual percentage but both calculated and paid monthly (or sometimes quarterly or weekly) at annualized rates.|$|R

40|$|The cost {{to investors}} of {{investing}} in mutual equity funds through <b>management</b> <b>fees,</b> could be substantial {{when compared to the}} return they generate. If the fees are fairly set, they should give investors a high excess return, termed alpha, when compared to a passive benchmark. <b>Management</b> <b>fees</b> have been shown to give negative excess return in the US market, and we regress the excess return of Swedish equity funds as estimated by CAPM on <b>management</b> <b>fees.</b> Our prediction is that higher <b>management</b> <b>fees</b> leads to lower alpha...|$|R
50|$|The <b>{{management}}</b> <b>fee</b> is paid by {{the fund}} to the management company or sponsor that organizes the fund, provides the portfolio management or investment advisory services and normally lends its brand to the fund. The fund manager may also provide other administrative services. The <b>management</b> <b>fee</b> often has breakpoints, which means that it declines as assets (in either the specific fund or in the fund family as a whole) increase. The fund's board reviews the <b>management</b> <b>fee</b> annually. Fund shareholders must vote on any proposed increase, but the fund manager or sponsor can agree to waive {{some or all of}} the <b>management</b> <b>fee</b> in order to lower the fund's expense ratio.|$|R
50|$|Malkiel discussed, and discarded, the {{hypothesis}} that the discount is due to the <b>management</b> <b>fees.</b> The argument of the paper is that since <b>management</b> <b>fees</b> are generally constant, this view would not explain changes {{in the size of the}} discount during the life-cycle of a fund. Furthermore, if the discount resulted from <b>management</b> <b>fees,</b> it should be related (Malkiel contended) to interest rates, yet the data do not support any such tie.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the dynamic price-setting (through changes in the <b>management</b> <b>fees)</b> in the Spanish mutual fund industry. The study is applied to a sample of Spanish mutual funds from 2002 to 2007. <b>Management</b> <b>fee</b> changes account only for a 4 % of the observations, but they are {{economically}} significant. A substantial 29 % of the total number of funds is involved on <b>management</b> <b>fee</b> changes along the sample period, with an average change larger than 0. 5 basis points. Results seem to reveal that small and poor-performer funds (and also management companies) have decreased asset-based <b>management</b> <b>fees</b> as a way to improve its degree of competition in the industry. However, no significant effects on this line are found in the paper. Small funds, with low excess returns, high quarterly returns and being owned by good performer management companies have decreased performance-based <b>management</b> <b>fees.</b> These performance-based <b>management</b> <b>fee</b> decreases, seem to have been a negative effect on the subsequent returns and on the net excess returns and a positive impact on the fund market share.

A principal conclusion is that reform in public <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> needs to be defined against the capacity of countries to sustain it at the national level. This requires a careful definition of priorities for action and the determination of appropriate pacing and sequencing of reform. In this decision, achievement of the imperatives of expenditure control and sustainability of deficits is typically more important than exploitation of the scope for efficiency gains promised by "cutting edge" public <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> systems.
