50|$|The unnamed {{man that}} would become <b>Hardwire</b> {{received}} his powers from Rex Mundi and became a hitman for the crime lord, The Operator. Asked by Mundi to kill Hardcase, the Operator offered <b>Hardwire</b> the job. He seriously wounds Hardcase with a surprise attack, but is unable to kill him due to the ultraheroine Choice's intervention. Later that night, a recovered Hardcase defeats <b>Hardwire</b> by dislocating his shoulders. <b>Hardwire</b> is {{turned over to the}} police.|$|R

25|$|The Famicom was {{released}} in Japan on July 15, 1983, for ¥14,800. The launch titles for the console were Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Junior, and Popeye. The console itself was intentionally designed {{to look like a}} toy, with a bright red-and-white color scheme and two <b>hardwired</b> gamepads that are stored visibly at the sides of the unit.|$|E
50|$|When Hardcase and Choice set out {{to break}} into Groom Lake facility, Headknocker was given the {{opportunity}} to repay Hardcase.

25|$|<b>Hardwired...</b> to Self-Destruct is {{the tenth}} studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, {{released}} as a double album on November 18, 2016 by their vanity label Blackened Recordings. It is their first studio album {{in eight years}} following Death Magnetic (2008), marking the longest gap between two studio albums in the band's career. It is also their first studio album not to feature songwriting credits from lead guitarist Kirk Hammett since he joined the band in 1983, and their first studio album released through Blackened. <b>Hardwired...</b> to Self-Destruct was produced by Greg Fidelman, who engineered and mixed Death Magnetic. The album was Metallica's sixth consecutive studio album to debut at {{number one on the}} US Billboard 200, selling 291,000 album-equivalent units in its first week, and topping the charts in 57 countries. Having this album number one marked the second time in history that any band of any genre, along with Dave Matthews Band, would have six consecutive albums debut at number one. The album has sold over three million copies worldwide, and critical reception of the album was mostly positive.|$|E

40|$|The role of {{synaptic}} plasticity in associative learning has been explored extensively computationally. Yet, the computational mechanism for <b>hardwiring</b> of the neural circuit {{has only been}} addressed recently using a systems approach of whole-animal behavior based on an evolutionary process for survival [1, 2]. In this paper, we will explore the computational criteria needed to establish the <b>hardwiring</b> of reflex. The traditional focus of {{synaptic plasticity}} is often placed on addressing {{the conditions in which}} the learning process occurs so as to alter the synaptic strength rather than the conditions in which the learning process should stop. This paper addresses the question of the conditions under which learning should stop and <b>hardwiring</b> begins.

25|$|While the NES in {{its heyday}} was never officially {{released}} in the Soviet Union, an unlicensed Chinese hardware clone named the Dendy was produced in Russia in the early 1990s. Aesthetically, it is an exact duplicate of the original Famicom, with the color scheme and labels altered. In addition, the <b>hardwired</b> controllers of the original console were omitted in favor of removable controllers which connected {{to the front of}} the unit using DE-9 serial connectors, identical to those used in the Atari 2600 and the Atari 8-bit family of computers.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} model Famicom featured two game controllers, both {{of which}} were <b>hardwired</b> {{to the back of the}} console. The second controller lacked the START and SELECT buttons, but featured a small microphone. Relatively few games made use of this feature. The earliest produced Famicom units initially had square A and B buttons. This was changed to the circular designs because of the square buttons being caught in the controller casing when pressed down and glitches within the hardware causing the system to freeze occasionally while playing a game.|$|E
25|$|The {{plugs and sockets}} used {{to power}} {{electric}} stoves from a single-phase line have to be rated for greater current values than ones for three-phase system because all the power has to be transferred through a single line. Electric stoves are often <b>hardwired</b> to the electrical supply system, connected to the mains with an appropriate high power industrial connector or with non-standard high power proprietary domestic connector (as some countries do not have wiring regulations for single-phase electric stoves). In Russia an electric stove can often be seen connected with a 25 to 32A connector.|$|E

25|$|Near {{the end of}} the NES's lifespan, {{upon the}} release of the AV Famicom and the top-loading NES 2, the design of the game {{controllers}} was modified slightly. Though the original button layout was retained, the redesigned device abandoned the brick shell in favor of a dog bone shape. In addition, the AV Famicom joined its international counterpart and dropped the <b>hardwired</b> controllers in favor of detachable controller ports. The controllers included with the Famicom AV had cables which were 90cm (3 feet) long, compared to the standard 180cm (6 feet) of NES controllers.|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{claims about}} <b>hardwired</b> sex {{differences}} interact with people’s minds {{as they are}} communicated {{to the public in}} popular books and articles. ‘Brain facts’ have become increasingly popular and persuasive on public attitudes due to the increased fascination with neuroscience. Suggestions made in public domains that sex differences in achievement in science, mathematics or philosophy can be explained by innate brain differences can have important psychological effects. Haslam and colleagues found that emphasis on the biological causes of sex differences in intelligence suggests inevitability and fixedness, creating essentialist beliefs about gender that deepen social divides.|$|E
25|$|Beyond academia, the {{endorsement}} of biological explanations of sex differences in intelligence {{has been associated with}} greater modern day sexism. In their research on the theorization of gender, Morton and colleagues found that people shown scientific claims that males and females are <b>hardwired</b> to be different, compared to those told that such ideas are under debate, expressed more agreement that society treats women fairly. Additionally, male participants became more supportive of sex discrimination at work after reading the scientific facts. Other research indicates that shifting the focus from biological to environmental contributors of behavior can decrease endorsement of sexist hierarchies.|$|E
