The Secretary of State shall, within ninety days after the enactment of this section, establish orderly and expeditious procedures, including provision for necessary administrative actions and inter-agency memorandum of understanding, which are mutually agreeable to the Secretaries of Energy, Defense, and Commerce, the Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the preparation of the executive branch judgment on export applications under this section. Such procedures shall include, at a minimum, explicit direction on the handling of such applications, express deadlines for the solicitation and collection of the views of the consulted agencies (with identified officials responsible for meeting such deadlines), an inter-agency coordinating authority to monitor the processing of such applications, predetermined procedures for the expeditious handling of intra-agency and inter-agency disagreements and appeals to higher authorities, frequent meetings of inter-agency administrative coordinators to review the status of all pending applications, and similar administrative mechanisms. To the extent practicable, an applicant should be advised of all the information required of the applicant for the entire process for every agency's needs {{at the beginning of the}} process. Potentially controversial applications should be identified as quickly as possible so that any required policy decisions or diplomatic consultations can be initiated in a timely manner. An immediate effort should be undertaken to establish quickly any necessary standards and criteria, including the nature of any required assurances or evidentiary showings, for the decisions required under this section. The processing of any <b>export</b> <b>application</b> proposed and filed as of the date of enactment of this section shall not be delayed pending the development and establishment of procedures to implement the requirements of this section. The executive branch judgment shall be completed in not more than sixty days from receipt of the application or request, unless the Secretary of State in his discretion specifically authorizes additional time for consideration of the application or request because it is in the national interest to allow such additional time. The Secretary shall notify the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on International Relations of the House of Representatives of any such authorization. In submitting any such judgment, the Secretary of State shall specifically address the extent to which the export criteria then in effect are met and the extent to which the cooperating party has adhered to the provisions of the applicable agreement for cooperation.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an approach and an associated system named Hypatia for accessing and processing data by coordinating services in dynamic environments. A dynamic environment consists of applications, servers and devices {{that can be}} static and nomad, and that produce or consume data on demand (e. g., online applications, Web-hosted DBMS) or continuously (messaging systems, mobile services). In such an environment, data are hidden behind services that <b>export</b> <b>application</b> programming interfaces (API) through heterogeneous networks and that provide functions for retrieving and processing data. In order to have an aggregated and integrated view of the dynamic environment at every moment (e. g., accessing Googles agenda service and feeding a Twitter service for continuously locating friends as we all stroll in a city), data consumers have to execute sets of service calls, i. e., subscribe to continuous data producers, aggregate results and feed other services and then obtain results and eventually start over again. No off-the-shelf DBMS provides such service oriented querying approach including continuous, one-shot, mobile and static query evaluation. Our work introduces the notion of hybrid query that declaratively expresses data consumers requirements and an associated query evaluator, Hypatia, that executes data oriented query service coordinations; {{taking advantage of the}} services available in the network (data providers and devices computing capacity) and yielding the query result...|$|E
40|$|A {{contribution}} is made toward assessing some socio-economic {{effects of the}} export woodchip industry in Tasmania. This is considered important since the industry was initially promoted as being desirable {{from the point of}} view of rural development and other social and economic benefits. This thesis examines woodchip industry effects at both the State and regional level and is introduced by reference to studies of the social and economic role of forest industries in Australia and New Zealand. Observation of the nature of the Tasmanian economy and trends in major forest industries shows that the export woodchip industry epitomizes the peripheral economic position of Tasmania and represents a continuation of the major thrust of change in Tasmanian forestry, involving concentration of control over Crown forests, increasing capital intensity of industry, and declining employment with rising volumes of wood used. Review of the operation of the two export woodchip companies in Tasmania shows that the industry has furthered control over Crown forests by one company, Associated Pulp and Paper Mills Ltd, and that the stated intentions of legislation covering concessions to Crown forests from which woodchips are produced are unlikely to be fulfilled. Employment associated with the woodchip industry is discussed and it is shown that approximately 1300 people are employed in cutting, handling, and processing of pulpwood for <b>export.</b> <b>Application</b> of an employment multiplier suggests that the industry supports approximately 3750 jobs throughout Tasmania. The state-wide appraisal of woodchipping also involves an assessment of public expenditure on. transport infrastructure for the industry and on Forestry Commission management of concession areas. It is estimated that the industry receives a minimum public subsidy of 10 million annually. Regional effects of the industry are investigated in a comparative case study of two municipalities, Spring Bay and Esperance. Greater impact in terms of population growth and increasing employment is apparent in the smaller Spring Bay municipality where preexisting industry was less developed and which lacked an appreciable background in forestry. The results of a questionnaire survey of community attitudes in both Municipalities are reported [...] Opinions and attitudes are examined by two approaches; general opinions are described while attitudes to particular aspects of municipal life and the woodchip or woodpulp industry are measured using Likert-type attitude scales. Both communities regarded the respective industries favourably, but in Spring Bay, the woodchip industry was found to be more widely supported than was the woodpulp industry in Esperance. Significant problems associated with each industry,mainly involved environmental and forest management concerns. Factors which most influenced attitudes in both municipalities are also identified and discussed in terms of differing historical development and industry effects. While the regional significance of the export woodchip industry is acknowledged, on a state-wide level the benefits are not as conspicuous. This thesis highlights the need for continuing assessment of the industry on both levels...|$|E

40|$|The Model View Definition (MVD) {{approach}} to interoperability of BIM models requires software vendors to write export functions that can map their internal representation {{to the whole}} scope of each of many domain-specific target MVDs.

40|$|In a {{real-time}} collaborative system, one user’s actions must be instantaneously propagated to all {{the other}} current participants. A session might start with some users, others might join in later, and still others might leave and join again. Unlike stateless collaborative applications such as videoconferencing and discussion groups, state-full collaborative applications must offer latecomer and crash recovery support. Such applications include shared electronic whiteboards, chat rooms, collaborative design, collaborative virtual worlds, and multiplayer games. There are two main research directions in this area: logging and playback of events, and <b>exporting</b> the <b>application</b> state to newcomers. Both have advantages and shortcomings. Event logging and playback imposes minimal requirements on applications and lets latecomers see how the existing participants reached the present state. However, it can require an excessive amount of storage, because sessions can last a long time. Bringing a latecomer up to date might also take a long time, for the same reason. The other technique, <b>exporting</b> the <b>application</b> state to each latecomer, has minimal storage requirements and takes relatively little time. However, the latecomer cannot see how the present situation developed. Also, the application must provide for exporting its data structures.
