5|$|The African {{species is}} a partial migrant, but its {{movements}} are complex, seasonal and poorly studied. It is mainly a wet-season breeder, and many birds {{move away from}} the equator as soon as the rains provide sufficient <b>grass</b> <b>cover</b> to allow them to breed elsewhere. Southward movement is mainly from November to April, the return north beginning when burning or drought reduces the <b>grass</b> <b>cover</b> again. This species is present throughout the year in some West African countries, and in equatorial regions, but even in those areas numbers vary seasonally due to local movements; internal north–south migration has been noted within countries including Nigeria, Senegal, The Gambia, Côte d'Ivoire and Cameroon. This crake has also wandered further afield. It is rare on Bioko Island (Equatorial Guinea), and there have been two records each for São Tomé and Tenerife, the Canary Islands birds being the first records for the Western Palaeartic.|$|E
5|$|This crake is {{a partial}} migrant, but {{although}} it is less skulking than many of its relatives, its movements are complex and poorly studied; the distribution map is therefore largely hypothetical. It is mainly a wet-season breeder, and many birds {{move away from the}} equator as soon as the rains provide sufficient <b>grass</b> <b>cover</b> to allow them to breed elsewhere. Southward movement is mainly from November to April, the return north beginning when burning or drought reduces the <b>grass</b> <b>cover</b> again. This species is present throughout the year in some West African countries, and in equatorial regions, but even in those areas numbers vary seasonally due to local movements; north-south migration has been noted within countries including Nigeria, Senegal, The Gambia, Ivory Coast and Cameroon. Migration takes place at night and involves small groups of up to eight birds; It may be one or two months after the rains begin before the grass is sufficiently high for breeding birds to arrive. Even in southern Africa, some birds may stay after breeding if enough usable habitat remains.|$|E
5|$|Four-horned antelopes tend {{to inhabit}} areas with {{significant}} <b>grass</b> <b>cover</b> or heavy undergrowth, and avoid human settlements. Earlier common throughout deciduous forests in India, the antelope now occurs in widely disjunct, small populations. Most of the populations are in India, and lower numbers {{can be found}} in adjoining Nepal. The four-horned antelope is threatened by the loss of its natural habitat due to agricultural expansion. Moreover, the unusual four-horned skull and the horns have been a popular target for trophy hunters. The four-horned antelope is classified as Vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN).|$|E

5|$|The African crake (Crex egregia) is {{a bird in}} {{the rail}} family that breeds in most of sub-Saharan Africa away from the arid south and southwest. It is {{seasonally}} common in most of its range other than the rainforests and areas that have low annual rainfall. This crake is a partial migrant, {{moving away from the}} equator as soon as the rains provide sufficient <b>grass</b> <b>cover</b> to allow it to breed elsewhere. There have been a few records of vagrant birds reaching Atlantic islands. This species nests {{in a wide variety of}} grassland types, and agricultural land with tall crops may also be used.|$|E

25|$|Pitches in New Zealand, {{like the}} ones at Eden Park, Auckland and Basin Reserve, Wellington can have a green tinge similar to their {{counterparts}} in England. These cricket grounds are amongst the most picturesque in the world. The ball swings a lot due to the proximity of most grounds to the sea, relative humidity and moisture under the surface. New Zealand pitches are often bouncy and quick in nature due to the usual <b>grass</b> <b>cover</b> left on them. The <b>grass</b> <b>cover</b> offers seam movement early on, but also maintains {{the integrity of the}} pitch which can often dampen the effect of spin bowling but allows pitches to flatten out {{over the course of a}} match. Batting can be trying early on and batsman often take time to adjust to the conditions. As they are often in open stadiums bowlers can frequently be assisted by winds that increase the speed the batsmen faces the ball at one end. At the other end, the wind acts as a wall and decreases the pace on the ball and as result adjusting to this is often the most trying part for a visiting team.|$|E
25|$|Holt {{attempted}} grazing, {{first with}} sheep {{which had to}} be destroyed when they became infected with footrot, and then with cattle. The land on his estate was not suited for intensive grazing, so after most of the trees were felled, herds of cattle then removed the stabilizing <b>grass</b> <b>cover</b> and exposed the sand dunes underneath. Large expanses of sand had been exposed along the coastline. The dune system that covers an area of , measuring 40 meters above and 90 meters below sea level, became unstable and began to move north at a rate of 8 meters a year. Land clearing and cattle grazing resulted in a degraded landscape, but created the distinctive Cronulla sand dunes of today.|$|E

25|$|As {{noted by}} Tinley (1969), typical {{habitats}} of Kirk's dik-dik consist of thicket mosaics characterized by well-developed shrub layers and scant short <b>grass</b> <b>cover.</b> Dik-diks live in pairs on territories of 2–86 acres, depending on cover and resources. If no unfavorable events occur {{a pair of}} Kirk's dik-dik may reside within the same territory for life. Males are the main defenders of territories, as females are unable to maintain territories themselves. (Kingdon 1982) According to MacDonald (1985), territorial conflicts over quality habitat are not frequent, however, when do they occur, males charge one another, stopping just short of physical contact, before repeating the process by running from a longer distance. Furthermore, the encounter ends when one male surrenders, which results in both males scratching at the ground, urinating, and defecating".|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, BLM {{said it would}} reduce the herd from its {{existing}} 195 adults to 120. The goal was to temporarily remove feral horses from the refuge to allow the range {{to recover from the}} historic overgrazing caused by livestock, not because BLM believed there were too many horses on the range. According to Jared Bybee, BLM wild horse and burro specialist, <b>grass</b> <b>cover</b> on the range was at just 18 percent of its historic average. Sixty percent of the remaining horses would be males, to reduce the rate of population growth. The agency said it would remove 30 horses a year from the herd and stable them at a yearly cost of $18,000 to $21,000 until the correct herd size and sex ratios had been reached. Horses to be removed from the herd included those which did not closely fit the conformity type; which were genetically well represented; which were 11 to 15 years of age, had sired or foaled, and were not band stallions; and were between five and 10 years of age or 16 to 20 years of age. Genetic diversity would be measured by visual observation of the herd's conformity to type (using a visual system developed by Dr. Sponenberg), and measures taken to improve genetic diversity if signs of inbreeding occurred. The Cloud Foundation and Front Range Equine Rescue, both feral horse advocacy groups, challenged the roundup in federal court. A federal district court judge delayed the roundup three days to consider their request, but on September 2, 2009, rejected the injunction and allowed the roundup to proceed.|$|E
