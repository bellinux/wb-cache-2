500|$|The shipwrecks continued, nonetheless, {{with one}} of the most {{profitable}} of all being the 1931 wreck of the 6,000-ton Danish freighter Pennsylvania on the neighbouring island of Swona. The vessel was plundered by the inhabitants of Stroma, Swona and South Ronaldsay. Much of her cargo of slot machines, spark plugs, clothing, tobacco, watches and car parts was looted and concealed in haystacks, oatfields, lochs and caves. David Stogdon, a lifeboatman, recalled seeing what the islanders did with their illicit salvage: [...] "Every house was stuffed with wreck ... clocks, telescopes, binnacles... <b>I</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> enormous dining-room tables in small cottages. And then of course from time to time they'd have cargo parts of lorries or something like that which could be put together to make a lorry and taken ashore on two or three fishing boats in calm weather. They'd land it quietly somewhere, drive it along and sell it." [...] Customs officers, policemen, coastguards and Receivers of Wreck were not generally welcome – the island had no police force – and the islanders let it be understood that unfortunate things could happen to the boats of unwanted visitors: [...] "Police boats could go missing, develop an unexpected leak or spontaneously combust." [...] The area still presents hazards to passing ships; in January 1993, the Danish coaster Bettina Danica ran aground off the southern end of Stroma. The wreck was broken apart by the action of the sea in 1997 and only her stern section is still visible.|$|E
2500|$|At a party held at Simmons' {{residence}} in Bel Air, Los Angeles {{to celebrate the}} success of The Robe, Burton met Elizabeth Taylor for the first time. Taylor, {{who at the time}} was married to actor Michael Wilding and was pregnant with their first child, recalled her first impression of Burton being [...] "rather full of himself. <b>I</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that he never stopped talking, and I had given him the cold fish eye." [...] Hamlet was a challenge that both terrified and attracted him, as it was a role many of his peers in the British theatre had undertaken, including Gielgud and Olivier. He shared his anxiety with de Havilland whilst coming to terms with her. Bogart too, didn't make it easy for him when he retorted: [...] "I never knew a man who played Hamlet who didn't die broke." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{seemingly}} octogenarian blues player {{played by}} McKinney in blackface. He {{first appeared in}} a sketch in which {{he talked about his}} failed relationship with [...] "Kathy with a K" [...] (McCulloch) from the Secretary sketches and soon grew into a recurring character. [...] His name and style of speech suggest that he may be a parody of the blues guitarist Mississippi Fred McDowell, and an early sketch reveals that Gary is actually a white college graduate who imitates a bluesman due to an affection for the musical style. Gary would always begin a long, blues-related story with the words [...] "Now, <b>I</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> a time..." [...] in a deep Mississippi accent before launching into a harmonica solo or blues song. His songs include [...] "The 'There is a Very Effective Heckler in My Audience' Blues" [...] (in a sketch where Dave Foley, in the audience, points out that Gary actually has very little to complain about as he makes over $10,000 a night) and [...] "Smokin' On the Night Train".|$|E
6000|$|Now thought I to myself, who {{is there}} in the world who could see a man catch hold of the handle of a pistol in the {{recesses}} of a dark place and under a blanket at night, except the owner of that voice which <b>I</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> hearing in a certain drawing-room in England? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hate to {{hurt your}} feelings," [...] I heard her say. [...] "I'm very sorry."... She {{looked up at}} me. Afterwards, when {{reflecting}} on the scene, <b>I</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that {{there were tears in}} her eyes. I was not in a condition to appreciate her splendid sincerity. I was overwhelmed and inarticulate. I left her there, on the bench, and went back to George's, announcing my intention of taking the five o'clock train....|$|R
6000|$|... "There was a {{good deal}} more on't," [...] said Sam, pausing, [...] "but <b>I</b> don't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> it; but it's real solemn and affectin'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, that settles it. Mrs. Oldmore, too; <b>I</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> the name. Excuse my curiosity, {{but often}} in calling upon one friend one finds another." ...|$|E
60|$|So in {{the first}} five minutes of our talk, as <b>I</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> it now, old Ewart struck the note that ran through all that morning's intercourse....|$|E
60|$|RAMSDEN. [who {{has been}} staring at Mendoza] <b>I</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> {{the face of}} your friend here. [Mendoza rises politely and {{advances}} with a smile between Ann and Ramsden].|$|E
60|$|I had no notion whether Therese {{could hear}} me. <b>I</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that she slept in any bed that {{happened}} to be vacant. For all I knew {{she might have been}} asleep in mine. As I had no matches on me I waited for a while in the dark. The house was perfectly still. Suddenly without the slightest preliminary sound light fell into the room and Therese stood in the open door with a candlestick in her hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll pay all right, sir," [...] Masters answered. [...] "Fact is, {{after our}} luncheon party I'm afraid I {{got a bit}} fuddled. <b>I</b> don't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> much." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Goodbye, Dad, goodbye [...] [...] [...] {{what was}} it the parish priest {{suggested}} <b>to</b> me ... <b>I</b> don't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> [...] [...] [...] Oh, what wonderful things I see ...".|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} {{stopping at}} a garage in Schoenstrom, I'm almost sure it was, for something. <b>I</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> {{it was a}} good place. Do you own it? Really?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that I {{and the two}} hidalgos bore Philippa to a {{couch in}} the patio, while I smiled and smiled and talked of {{the heat of the}} weather! ...|$|E
6000|$|Katie dined with us yesterday, looking wonderfully well, {{and singing}} [...] "Excelsior" [...] {{with a certain}} {{dramatic}} fire in her, whereof <b>I</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> having seen sparks afore now. Etc. etc. etc.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am quite}} well, sir, thank you. Sleep and the doctor, and the doctor's cook, have done wonders for me. I hear you came yesterday, sir, but <b>I</b> don't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> much about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I dunno how I feels," [...] Evan replied. [...] "I hardly {{knows where}} I am, or how I got here, though <b>I</b> do <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> {{something}} about this 'ere place too. Oh yes!" [...] he exclaimed suddenly, [...] "I was trying to fetch out poor little Flossy, and the ice would not break, and I got colder and colder, and then <b>I</b> don't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> any more except somehow that I was here with people standing round me, and I swallowed something hot {{and went off to}} sleep. Ah yes! you were the gentleman as said you would come in after me if I sang out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw a man," [...] said Tomlinson. [...] "I {{figured it}} wouldn't {{be wise to}} show myself until I was sure of him. Then when I crawled up to the shanty <b>I</b> didn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> anything. <b>I</b> only wanted to get in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of late I've {{thought of}} that story often. Some hidden recess of my memory has been opened, and <b>I</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> strange things. Was I the boy who looked in the ink?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it Jacob Meyer {{who makes}} that noise?" [...] asked Mr. Clifford faintly. [...] "And, Benita, {{where have you}} been so long, and--who is this gentleman with you? <b>I</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> his face." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean to say, I'm not the type. You have to {{have some}} terrific nib to give away prizes. <b>I</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember,</b> when I was at school, it was {{generally}} a prime minister or somebody." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, if {{you mean}} to say that you were one o' them burglars," [...] {{continued}} the constable, [...] "why, say it and I'll take you with pleasure. Come to think of it, <b>I</b> did <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> one o' their voices." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} your telling me so," [...] Jacob observed. [...] "I also {{remember your}} {{telling me that}} it had another two months to run, whereas it expires to-morrow. What <b>I</b> don't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember,</b> though, is your asking me for my share of the contributing money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} seeing some fellows {{in the lower}} hall--Major Mason, Bart White, {{and one or two}} others. But <b>I</b> can't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> seeing anybody upstairs--and yet, somehow or other, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> me <b>I</b> did pass somebody just before I ran into my room," [...] and now Ned looked perplexed.|$|R
60|$|The {{other two}} who {{completed}} that company are of no account, and indeed their names escape me, though <b>I</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> {{that one was}} named Pacini {{and that he was}} said to be a philosopher of considerable parts.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] ses Bob Pretty, in a {{thoughtful}} voice, to Smith—"I wonder whether you or Mr. Cutts kicked ’em {{in the pond}} while you was struggling with me. Come to think of it, <b>I</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> ’earing a splash." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, young sir," [...] and he {{held out}} his hand to Harry, [...] "I can promise you my aid and protection, to the utmost, in {{whatever}} matter you may be concerned. <b>I</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> the name of your companion, too." ...|$|E
60|$|I was {{surprised}} at Angela. Odd how you never realize that every girl is at heart a vicious specimen until something goes wrong with her love affair. This cousin and I had been meeting freely since the days when I wore sailor suits and she hadn't any front teeth, yet only now was I beginning to get on to her hidden depths. A simple, jolly, kindly young pimple she had always struck me as--the sort you could more or less rely on not to hurt a fly. But here she was now laughing heartlessly--at least, <b>I</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> hearing her laugh heartlessly--like something cold and callous out of a sophisticated talkie, and fairly spitting on {{her hands in her}} determination to bring Tuppy's grey hairs in sorrow to the grave.|$|R
50|$|I {{had never}} heard the name NYARLATHOTEP before, but <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> {{understand}} the allusion. Nyarlathotep {{was a kind of}} itinerant showman or lecturer who held forth in public halls and aroused widespread fear and discussion with his exhibitions. These exhibitions consisted of two parts — first, a horrible — possibly prophetic — cinema reel; and later some extraordinary experiments with scientific and electrical apparatus. As I received the letter, <b>I</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> recall that Nyarlathotep was already in Providence.... <b>I</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that persons had whispered to me in awe of his horrors, and warned me not to go near him. But Loveman's dream letter decided me.... As I left the house I saw throngs of men plodding through the night, all whispering affrightedly and bound in one direction. I fell in with them, afraid yet eager to see and hear the great, the obscure, the unutterable Nyarlathotep.|$|R
6000|$|... "Splendid," [...] he replied, [...] "excellently arranged. I {{never knew}} you were so well acquainted with {{the works of the}} old writers. Why, there is {{scarcely}} a classic of any note that you have not quoted from. But where--where," [...] he added, musing, [...] "did you get that last idea but two from? It's the only one <b>I</b> don't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember.</b> It isn't a bit of your own, is it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, no doubt, {{else you}} would be a saint, not a man, and even the saints had their faults, or so <b>I</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember,</b> and became saints by repentance and conquering them. Still, I am sure that you will help me if you can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't understand. It was {{something}} new to my experience here to find an able-bodied American citizen with an honest genuine grievance who had to have it drawn from him like a decayed tooth. But you have been here before. <b>I</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> your face." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know what's amiss with me," [...] {{continued}} Austin, staggering to his feet. [...] "I expect I {{came over}} queer when I was hosing her down. <b>I</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> flopping {{over by the}} step. But I'll swear I never left those lubricator taps on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{find myself}} {{constrained}} to ask you," [...] he said, in a studiously measured tone, [...] "by what means you became possessed of the pearls you are wearing? <b>I</b> do not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> them as your property." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, heavens!" [...] exclaimed the consul, hurriedly {{adjusting}} his spectacles. [...] "Are you a Yale man, too? Were {{you in that}} crowd? <b>I</b> don't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> any {{one with}} red--any one named Maloney. Such a lot of college men <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have misused their advantages. One of the best mathematicians {{of the class of}} '91 is selling lottery tickets in Belize. A Cornell man dropped off here last month. He was second steward on a guano boat. I'll write to the department if you like, Maloney. Or if there's any tobacco, or newspa--" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{did not run}} {{without a}} goal in view. My {{objective}} was the study. This, as I have explained, was on the first floor. Its window looked out on to a strip of lawn {{at the side of}} the house ending in a shrubbery. The drop would not be pleasant, but <b>I</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> a waterspout that ran up the wall close to the window, and, in any case, I was not in a position to be deterred by the prospect of a bruise or two. I had not failed to realize that my position was one of extreme peril. When Buck, concluding the tour of the house, found that the Little Nugget was not there--as I had reason to know that he would--there was no room for doubt that he would withdraw the protection which he had extended to me up to the present in my capacity of guide. On me the disappointed fury of the raiders would fall. No prudent consideration for their own safety would restrain them. If ever the future was revealed to man, I saw mine. My only chance was to get out into the grounds, where the darkness would make pursuit an impossibility.|$|R
