5|$|Sophisticated counterfeits {{have been}} found in several Asian {{countries}} such as Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, and are an important cause of avoidable death in those countries. The WHO said that studies indicate that up to 40% of artesunate-based malaria medications are counterfeit, especially in the Greater Mekong region and have established a rapid alert system to enable information about counterfeit drugs to be rapidly reported to the relevant authorities in participating countries. There is no reliable way for doctors or lay people to detect counterfeit drugs without <b>help</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> laboratory. Companies are attempting to combat the persistence of counterfeit drugs by using new technology to provide security from source to distribution.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevalent}} {{force of}} Alchemy in Weyard's ancient past enabled {{the development of}} great civilizations. However, this thriving period eventually {{gave way to a}} worldwide conflict that subsided only with the sealing away of Alchemy. The keys to unlocking Alchemy, the four Elemental Stars which hold the pure power of the four elements, are hidden within the mountain shrine, Mt. Aleph, which in turn is guarded by the town of Vale at the mountain's base. In the game's prologue, Saturos and Menardi, with <b>help</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> raiding party, storm Mt.

5|$|At the pre-E3 2005 press conference, Nintendo {{president}} Satoru Iwata {{announced that}} the next installment of Super Smash Bros. was soon to be in development for its next console and would be a launch title with Wi-Fi compatibility for online play. The announcement {{was a surprise to}} Sakurai, who left HAL Laboratory in 2003. He was not informed of Nintendo's intent to release another Smash Bros. game, despite the fact that Iwata told Sakurai shortly after his resignation from HAL that if a new Smash game was to be developed, he would want Sakurai to again serve as director. It was not until after the conference that Iwata requested that Sakurai hold a private meeting with him, where he was asked to be involved as Brawls director. Sakurai agreed to become director, and development of the game began in October 2005, when Nintendo opened a new office in Tokyo just for its production. <b>Help</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> variety of studios such as Monolith Soft and Paon was enlisted, with Game Arts as the main team in the preliminary development stages. In addition, several Smash Bros. staff members that resided {{in the area of the}} new office joined the project. Altogether, roughly 100 individuals worked on the project full-time, and were given access to all the original material and tools from the development of Melee, courtesy of HAL Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|In Lindblum, {{the party}} meets with Cid, who {{explains}} that he hired the group to kidnap Garnet to get her away from Brahne, who also worries him. Upon learning that Alexandria has invaded the city-state of Burmecia, the party splits in two. Zidane, Vivi, and new joinee Freya investigate Burmecia, while Dagger and Steiner journey back to Alexandria {{to try to stop}} Brahne from starting a war. Zidane's group finds that Burmecia has been conquered with <b>help</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> man named Kuja, and refugees have fled to the nearby city of Cleyra. They rush to Cleyra to defend it from the encroaching forces. Dagger, meanwhile, is ignored and captured by Brahne, who extracts powerful magical weapons called eidolons from her. Brahne proceeds to use one to destroy Cleyra. Zidane and company escaped the city on Brahne's airship and rescue Garnet, but while they do so Brahne attacks Lindblum with another eidolon.|$|E
5|$|The Second Crusade was {{announced}} by Pope Eugene III, {{and was the}} first of the crusades to be led by European kings, namely Louis VII of France and Conrad III of Germany, with <b>help</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> number of other European nobles. The armies of the two kings marched separately across Europe. After crossing Byzantine territory into Anatolia, both armies were separately defeated by the Seljuk Turks. The main Western Christian source, Odo of Deuil, and Syriac Christian sources claim that the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos secretly hindered the crusaders' progress particularly in Anatolia, where he is alleged to have deliberately ordered Turks to attack them. Louis and Conrad and the remnants of their armies reached Jerusalem and participated in 1148 in an ill-advised attack on Damascus. The crusade in the east was a failure for the crusaders and a great victory for the Muslims. It would ultimately have a key influence on the fall of Jerusalem and give rise to the Third Crusade at the end of the 12th century.|$|E

Luthern reveals that a girl named Goewin who runs a herb shop has {{recently}} disappeared. Diermot discovers that she had been arrested by the Skorl. With help from Ratpouch, Diermot breaks into the house of Taidgh, the magician, where he creates a potion which disguises him as Selena. He enters the mansion where Goewin is being held and orders the Skorl to free her. Not long after, a man named Mallin gives Diermot a book wrapped in cloth to take to a man named Morkus. In the process of delivering the book, Diermot sees a notice stating that whoever returns the book to its rightful owner will be rewarded.

5|$|Talion is then {{sought out}} by the warrior Lithariel, the {{daughter}} of Queen Marwen (Claudia Black), who claims {{to be able to}} assist Celebrimbor with his mission. Marwen is the ruler of NÃºrn, a kingdom of sea raiders located in the south of Mordor. She uses her powers to guide Talion and Celebrimbor to another of Celebrimbor's relics. Talion also gets <b>help</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Dwarf hunter named Torvin, teaching Talion the ways of the hunt to dominate Caragors and Graugs (beasts native to Mordor), eventually fighting a massive Graug from Torvin's past who killed Torvin's hunting partner, later revealed to be his brother. Later, Marwen advises them to use Celebrimbor's powers to take control of an army of orcs and other beasts, using them to lead an assault against Sauron. Talion eventually realizes that the wizard Saruman is possessing Marwen, and assists Lithariel in freeing her from his control. Talion, however, still carries out Saruman's plan, leading an army of mind-controlled orcs in an assault against the Black Hand's stronghold at Ered Glamhoth. However, rather than the Black Hand, Talion finds the Tower of Sauron waiting for him. The Tower mockingly taunts Talion that Celebrimbor chose him as a host and can free him at any time and offers the elf a place at Sauron's side. Refusing the offer, the two battle and Talion emerges victorious after viciously stabbing the Tower to death with his son's sword. Afterwards, Celebrimbor confesses that the Tower told the truth and promises to let Talion join his family in death if he wishes, once the Black Hand is slain.|$|E
