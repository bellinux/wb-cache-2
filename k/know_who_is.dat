5|$|In {{political}} {{circles in}} The Netherlands, the announcement caused widespread irritation about his plan. Christian Democrat senator Hans Hillen remarked that Wilders' words could endanger Dutch interests. Former NATO general secretary Jaap de Hoop Scheffer advised Wilders {{not to make}} a speech, arguing that the international public does not <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> in the Dutch cabinet and who is in parliament and thus Wilders' speech could be mistaken as an official statement of the Dutch government. Also Christian Democrat party leader and acting Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Maxime Verhagen issued a warning.|$|E
25|$|The 2008 Morelia grenade attacks {{took place}} on September 15, 2008, when two hand grenades were thrown onto a crowded plaza, killing ten people and {{injuring}} more than 100. Some see these efforts as intended to sap the morale of government agents assigned {{to crack down on}} the cartels; others see them as an effort to let citizens <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> winning the war. At least one dozen Mexican norteño musicians have been murdered. Most of the victims performed what are known as narcocorridos, popular folk songs that tell the stories of the Mexican drug trade—and celebrate its leaders as folk heroes.|$|E
25|$|President Young amongst {{other things}} {{said he knew}} the {{goodness}} of the people, and the Lord bears with our weakness; we must serve the Lord, and those who go with me will keep the Word of Wisdom, and if the High Priests, the Seventies, the Elders, and others will not serve the Lord, we will sever them from the Church. I will draw the line, and <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> for the Lord and who is not, and those who will not keep the Word of Wisdom, I will {{cut off from the}} Church; I throw out a challenge to all men and women.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} reasons for this discrepancy. First, some news sources include only pledged delegates in their total count, while others include superdelegates. Second, {{estimates}} of superdelegate votes are unreliable and are subject to change. Third, pledged delegates in many states are selected at county or state conventions late in the process; thus, the initial primary and caucus results provide only a projection of pledged delegates, highlighted by the discrepancies with the Iowa county convention results. Fourth, {{in the days after}} an election, results in individual precincts may be delayed, and news organizations may project the winners of those precincts based on statistical analysis or may wait for confirmed results. The Democratic nominating process is a complex system that has evolved over time, and in close races, it can be difficult under the current system to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> leading in the delegate count.|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} was praised in the U.S. by the litigants, their counsel, and politicians. Theodore Olson, {{counsel for the}} respondents, praised the ruling, saying it [...] "will bring long-overdue relief to ... victims of Iranian terrorism and their families, {{many of whom have}} waited decades for redress." [...] Praising the court's decision, lead plaintiff Deborah Peterson found solace that [...] "in the eyes of the law, we <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> responsible, and those who are responsible have been brought to the justice that we are capable of bringing them to here on earth." ...|$|E
500|$|Systemic {{consequences}} were felt, as Enron's creditors {{and other}} energy trading companies suffered {{the loss of}} several percentage points. Some analysts felt Enron's failure indicated the risks of the post-September 11 economy, and encouraged traders to lock in profits where they could. The question now became how to determine the total exposure of the markets and other traders to Enron's failure. Early calculations estimated $18.7 billion. One adviser stated, [...] "We don't really <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> out there exposed to Enron's credit. I'm telling my clients {{to prepare for the}} worst." ...|$|E

500|$|In the Reformed tradition, baptism's {{function}} as a rite of initiation into the church is secondary to its {{function as}} a sign of God's promise of grace. Reformed theologians distinguish between the visible church, which consists of those who publicly claim to have faith in Christ as well as their children; and the invisible church, which consists of those who actually have faith and have been regenerated. Baptism is believed to make one a member of the visible, rather than the invisible church. It is believed to be impossible to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> a member of the invisible church. As members of the visible church, baptized Christians are believed to have obligations to live in love and service to Christ and his people. The fulfillment of these obligations {{is referred to as the}} [...] "improvement" [...] of one's baptism.|$|E
500|$|Michael (Steve Carell), {{inspired}} by the film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, decides to put five [...] "golden tickets" [...] randomly into five different boxes of paper that will provide Dunder Mifflin clients with a ten percent discount for one year. Michael is excited about the promotional gimmick, which prompts him to dress and act like Wonka throughout the day. However, because Michael distributed all the tickets {{on the same day}} in the same small area of the warehouse, all five golden tickets go to their biggest client, the Blue Cross of Pennsylvania; because Michael did not specify [...] "limit one per customer", the company is owed a fifty percent discount. As a result, the Scranton branch is expected to lose a significant amount of revenue which could shut down the branch, making everyone in the office upset with Michael. When angry Chief Financial Officer David Wallace (Andy Buckley) demands to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> responsible, Michael claims Dwight (Rainn Wilson) thought of the idea. Michael tries to convince Dwight to take the fall, insisting that Michael needs the job more than Dwight and that it would allow Dwight to focus more energy on his beet farm.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} of The Lion King coincided {{with that of}} Pocahontas, {{which most of the}} animators of Walt Disney Feature Animation decided to work on instead, believing it would be the more prestigious and successful of the two. The story artists also did not have much faith in the project, with Chapman declaring she was reluctant to accept the job [...] "because the story wasn't very good", and writer Burny Mattinson saying to co-worker Joe Ranft [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> going to want to watch that one." [...] Most of the leading animators either were doing their first major work supervising a character, or had much interest in animating an animal. Thirteen of these supervising animators, both in California and in Florida, were responsible for establishing the personalities and setting the tone for the film's main characters. The animation leads for the main characters included Mark Henn on young Simba, Ruben A. Aquino on adult Simba, Andreas Deja on Scar, Aaron Blaise on young Nala, Anthony DeRosa on adult Nala, and Tony Fucile on Mufasa. Nearly 20 minutes of the film, including the [...] "I Just Can't Wait to Be King" [...] sequence, were animated at the Disney-MGM Studios facility. More than 600 artists, animators, and technicians contributed to The Lion King. Weeks before the film was to be released, the 1994 Northridge earthquake shut down the studio and required the animators to finish their work from home.|$|E

500|$|In her {{review for}} The New York Times, Eudora Welty noted Pilgrims narrator being [...] "the {{only person in}} [...] book, {{substantially}} {{the only one in}} her world .... Speaking of the universe very often, she is yet self-surrounded". [...] Dillard seemingly refers to the idea of an [...] "invisible narrator" [...] in the sixth chapter of Pilgrim at Tinker Creek; while referring to the [...] "infinite power" [...] of God, the narrator notes that [...] "invisibility is the all-time great 'cover'". [...] Nancy C. Parrish, author of the 1998 book Lee Smith, Annie Dillard, and the Hollins Group: A Genesis of Writers, notes that despite its having been written in the first person, Pilgrim is not necessarily autobiographical. [...] The narrator, [...] "Annie Dillard", therefore becomes a persona through which the author can experience and describe [...] "thoughts and events that the real Annie Dillard had only heard about or studied or imagined." [...] Critic Suzanne Clark also points to the [...] "peculiar evasiveness" [...] of Dillard-the-author, noting that [...] "when we read Annie Dillard, we don't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> writing. [...] There is a silence in the place where there might be an image of the social self—of personality, character, or ego". [...] While most critics assume that the narrator is female, mostly due to the autobiographical elements of the book and the assumption that the narrator is Dillard herself, Clark questions whether the narrator is male. [...] Stating that Dillard uses [...] "a variety of male voices, male styles" [...] throughout the book, Clark asks, [...] "When Dillard quit writing Pilgrim at Tinker Creek in the persona of a fifty year old man, did she then begin to write as a woman?" ...|$|E

2500|$|In his 2009 book, {{entitled}} Analytixz, Griff criticized his 1989 statement: [...] "to say the Jews {{are responsible}} for the majority of wickedness that went on around the globe I would have to know about the majority of wickedness that went on around the globe, which is impossible... I'm not the best knower. Then, not only knowing that, I would have to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> at the crux of all of the problems in the world and then blame Jewish people, which is not correct."

2500|$|In a {{plurality}} voting system, where {{the winner is}} the candidate with the most votes, {{it is important to}} <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> ahead. The terms [...] "statistical tie" [...] and [...] "statistical dead heat" [...] are sometimes used to describe reported percentages that differ by less than a margin of error, but these terms can be misleading. For one thing, the margin of error as generally calculated is applicable to an individual percentage and not the difference between percentages, so the difference between two percentage estimates may not be statistically significant even when they differ by more than the reported margin of error. The survey results also often provide strong information even when there is not a statistically significant difference.|$|E

That person is so close to you that you are able to share some things only with him. For example, you can call that friend, and from the very first maniacal laugh or some other joke you will <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> {{at the other end of}} that line.

[...] Uber responded with information about its insurance policy, including a $US5 million contingency liability insurance cover and [...] "each partner driver's own full insurance policies".
