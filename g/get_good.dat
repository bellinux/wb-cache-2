25|$|Like many later {{painters}} Hogarth wanted {{above all}} to achieve success at history {{painting in the}} Grand Manner, but his few attempts were not successful and are now little regarded. His portraits were mostly of middle-class sitters shown with an apparent realism that reflected both sympathy and flattery, and included some in the fashionable form of the conversation piece, recently introduced from France by Philippe Mercier, which was to remain a favourite in Britain, taken up by artists such as Francis Hayman, though usually abandoned once an artist could <b>get</b> <b>good</b> single figure commissions.|$|E

25|$|Filbert's {{plans for}} Nina have changed when she grew older. Instead of a {{professional}} music career, he wanted his daughter to earn college degree, and {{to join him in}} the United States to find work. She took up Accountancy at Miriam College, since she was good at numbers. Her father insisted that she would take up Law as a latter course. Because of too much love for singing, she disobeyed her father and joined different bands. He eventually gave up on trying to stop her, and just told her to maintain good grades. She did <b>get</b> <b>good</b> grades, and was even a consistent dean's lister.|$|E
25|$|The Cardinals {{had allowed}} 69 steals against them through September 8, while they had stolen only 32. Yadier Molina {{is not at}} fault {{as much as the}} {{pitchers}} letting the runners <b>get</b> <b>good</b> jumps, instead of holding them closer to first base. Since his debut in 2004, the team has never allowed more than 64 steals until this year. Molina's pop time—defined as the time elapsed from the moment the pitch hits the catcher's mitt to the moment the intended fielder receives the throw—is {{the same as it was}} last year (1.92 seconds), when he allowed 37 stolen bases and ranked third in the National League with a caught-stealing percentage of 41. That pop time ranks seventh best among all catchers in 2016.|$|E
25|$|The first National Day Parade {{started in}} the morning at 9:00a.m. that day. People came as early as 7:00a.m. in order to <b>get</b> <b>good</b> vantage points.

When the parade began, 6 military contingents (including the Singapore Infantry Regiment, SPDF and the then Republic of Singapore Police), a mobile column from the SIR, and various schools and civil contingents marched past City Hall and then into the city streets. Three military bands accompanied the parade inspection and later the march past with military music. The Singapore Fire Brigade also took part in this first parade with its firetrucks included in the mobile column. Rounding it all was a massed lion and dragon dance performance from drum and dragon troupes nationwide.|$|E

Naomi is trying her best to convince her possible new client. She is also faced with a problem when TA, Naomi's physics class partner, informs her that she has to pass his physics class, if she wants to pass the sophomore year. It turns out the TA is hurt, as Naomi has never invited him to any of the parties she has thrown in the past year. Later on, Naomi decides to help Liam make Vanessa’s party a success, so she can invite the TA to the party, and score a few brownie points. At the party, Naomi tells TA that she would rather work hard to <b>get</b> <b>good</b> marks on her project, than him favoring her in any way. In No Good Deed, Naomi decides to plan Mitchell Nash's daughters sweet sixteen birthday party, after a previous client told her she would not hire her without her having any professional experiences.|$|E
25|$|According to musicologist Gerald Abraham, the operas on {{the whole}} embody an {{enormous}} mass of music far too beautiful and interesting to be ignored. Moreover, he maintains, Tchaikovsky's search for operatic subjects, along with his views on their nature and treatment and his own work on librettos, throw considerable light on his creative personality. Nevertheless, according to musicologist Francis Maes, most of Tchaikovsky's operas failed for three reasons. First, the composer could not <b>get</b> <b>good</b> librettos, despite continued requests to some of Russia's leading playwrights and his brother Modest. Second, he was no Verdi, Puccini or Leoncavalo. While he could write music that was often beautiful and sometimes very moving, it was generally not as arresting dramatically as anything those three provided. Third, and perhaps most sadly, Tchaikovsky's enthusiasm for opera writing did not match his theatrical sense. Apparently either unaware of this deficiency or unable to curb his excitement long enough to take a cold, {{hard look at the}} true stage-worthiness of a libretto, he seemed destined to repeat his failures.|$|E
25|$|As well {{as having}} rights for fair treatment, the Equality Act 2010 {{requires}} {{that people are}} treated equally, {{unless there is a}} good justification, based on their gender, race, sexual orientation, beliefs and age. To combat social exclusion, employers must positively accommodate the needs of disabled people. Part-time staff, agency workers, and people on fixed-term contracts are treated generally equally compared to full-time or permanent staff. To tackle unemployment, all employees are entitled to reasonable notice before dismissal after a qualifying period of a month, after two years they can only be dismissed for a fair reason, and are entitled to a redundancy payment if their job was no longer economically necessary. If an enterprise is bought or outsourced, the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 require that employees' terms cannot be worsened without a good economic, technical or organisational reason. The purpose of these rights is to ensure people have dignified living standards, whether or not they have the relative bargaining power to <b>get</b> <b>good</b> terms and conditions in their contract.|$|E

He graduated from Palo Alto High School in 1996, where he acted in plays. This led to him attending CSSSA in 1998 for theatre. [...] In his high school years, Franco was arrested for underage drinking, graffiti, and for {{being a part of}} a group that stole designer fragrances from department stores and sold them to classmates. These arrests led to his briefly becoming a ward of the state. Facing the possibility of juvenile hall, Franco was given a second chance by the judge. [...] "It was teen angst.

500|$|It {{is known}} from his {{notebooks}} that Newton was grappling {{in the late}} 1660s {{with the idea that}} terrestrial gravity extends, in an inverse-square proportion, to the Moon; however it took him two decades to develop the full-fledged theory. The question was not whether gravity existed, but whether it extended so far from Earth that it could also be the force holding the Moon to its orbit. Newton showed that if the force decreased as the inverse square of the distance, one could indeed calculate the Moon's orbital period, and <b>get</b> <b>good</b> agreement. He guessed the same force was responsible for other orbital motions, and hence named it [...] "universal gravitation".|$|E
