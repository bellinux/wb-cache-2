Basic science preparation was learned through private tutors, self-study and lectures. Islamic hospitals were the first to keep written records of patients and their medical treatment. Students were responsible in keeping these patient records, which were later edited by doctors and referenced in future treatments.|$|E

For most of the employees, the firm confers on them that sense of belonging and identity –– the firm has become their “village”, their community.

2500|$|The {{traditional}} biblical interpretations {{explain that}} Sheol is a grim and desolated land below, {{occupied by the}} dead who continue their colorless existence irrespective of their earthly conduct. Contrary to this exposition however, the Hebrew Bible supports the descriptions of Sheol which {{suggest that it is}} something more than <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>place.</b> In terms of sheer numbers the amount of anthropomorphic descriptions is significant. [...] Sheol is either portrayed by means of human qualities ( [...] , Job 26:6; [...] , Canticles 8:6 [...] desire isaiah 5:14) or attributed with the elements of human anatomy: womb ( [...] , Jonah 2:3), hand ( [...] , Psalms 49:15; 89:48; Hosea 13:14) and mouth ( [...] , Psalms 141:7; Isaiah 5:14).

2500|$|Many {{different}} levels of salvation are explained, each depending upon the willpower of the individual accomplishing it. For {{those who do not}} remove their psychological imperfection (ego) – which is the cause of karma and the suffering of humanity – after approximately 108 rebirths they will have their ego removed forcefully through mechanical devolution within the infradimensions (Hell). Here it is said that [...] "Mother Nature" [...] mechanically pays out one’s accumulated karma through a great deal of suffering over thousands of years until one is returned to the state of an innocent elemental, or Essence. This {{is said to be a}} state of being that is total happiness, yet not cognizant happiness and therefore not complete happiness. It should be noted that Hell is not taught as a place of eternal damnation, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> to pay one’s karma, and in fact it is seen as a part of God's grace because if the ego is not removed forcefully, these souls would continue to suffer indefinitely. It is held that after Hell, the elemental is reinserted into the mechanics of evolution in order to once again attempt to gain conscious happiness: They are first inserted at the basic level of existence (minerals), and through millions of years, transmigrate through increasingly complex organisms until the state of intellectual animal is reached again.|$|E

She felt her old self, as if some depressing weight had been lifted, or a shadow had been swept away from between her and the sun. Her head was clear. The seeming iron band that had pressed it so hard was gone. She was cheerful. She even caught herself humming aloud as she divided the fish into messes for Mrs. Olsen, Maggie Donahue, and herself. She enjoyed her gossip with each of them, and, returning home, plunged joyfully into the task of putting the neglected house in order. She sang as she worked, and ever as she sang the magic words of the boy danced and sparkled among the notes: OAKLAND IS <b>JUST</b> <b>A</b> <b>PLACE</b> TO START FROM.|$|E

Certainly, as things were going, Oakland was not a place to stop in. The boy was right. It was a place to start from. But to go where? Here she was halted, and she was driven from the train of thought by a strong pull and a series of jerks on the line. She began to haul in, hand under hand, rapidly and deftly, the boy encouraging her, until hooks, sinker, and a big gasping rockcod tumbled {{into the bottom of the}} boat. The fish was free of the hook, and she baited afresh and dropped the line over. The boy marked his place and closed the book.|$|E
