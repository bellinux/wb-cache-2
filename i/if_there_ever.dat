In October, he became {{the chief of staff}} in the Ministry of Public Works in the second Titu Maiorescu executive, under Minister Alexandru Bădărău. He had manifested a relative interest in politics around 1908, after his father rallied with Take Ionescu and his Conservative-Democratic Party; at the time, he criticized Ion Luca's political choices, but nonetheless noted that it could serve as a means for his own advancement ("From now on I'll have political lode , something certain, <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>ever</b> was certainty on Earth.") Four years after this comment, soon after making his literary debut, he clashed with his father over having considered a cabinet appointment in Ionescu's executive.|$|E

500|$|The Field Spaniel was {{originally}} {{developed for the}} show ring by competitors who were attempting to develop an all-black Spaniel. Some of the breeding methods of those early developers were criticised; {{one of the first}} breeders of the Field Spaniel, Thomas Jacobs, said of the origin; [...] "Much has been written and said on the purity of the breed; deprecating the means I have adopted to produce them as calculated to alter a presumed type, and frequent missiles have at me and my dogs from behind the hedge.

GameSpy's Bill Hiles said that the game [...] "preceded the 'tactical squad-based, first-person shooter' action genre by a full two years", and that [...] "In 1996,...Terra Nova didn't feel like any other game out there". Hiles called Tribes 2 [...] "a spiritual descendent of Terra Nova <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>ever</b> was one". Project leader Dan Schmidt later said that he had [...] "a bit of a {{negative}} experience overall because the thing dragged on forever", but he noted that [...] "there are people who regard it highly so it can't have been that terrible".

The scene begins with the characters of Candy (Vanessa Hudgens), Brittany (Ashley Benson) and Cotty (Rachel Korine) standing in the backyard {{of the character of}} Alien (James Franco), who sits at a white grand piano. The girls are wearing My Little Pony ski masks, sparkly pink tiger bathing suits, sweatpants with [...] "DTF" [...] on the rear and shotguns in their hands.

500|$|At World's End {{was meant}} to return it tonally to a {{character}} piece. Sparrow, in particular, is tinged with madness after extended solitary confinement in Davy Jones's Locker, and now desires immortality. Sparrow struggles with {{what it takes to}} be a moral person, after his honest streak caused his doom in the second film. This is mainly shown by his increasingly erratic behaviour and Jack's hallucinations, which appeared to be simply his deranged mind in the beginning where dozens of [...] "Jack Sparrows" [...] appeared to crew the ship in his solitary exile, but later the hallucinations grew more important and there were mainly two [...] "Jacks" [...] constantly arguing about which path to follow: the immortality or the mortality. The last hallucination took place while Jack was imprisoned on the Dutchman, where his honest streak won (possibly due to not liking his sea creature-like [...] "future", which comedically dropped his brain and searched for it around the Brig). By the end of At World's End, Sparrow is sailing to the Fountain of Youth, an early concept for the second film. Rossio said in 2007 that a fourth film was possible, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer expressed interest in a spin-off. Gore Verbinski concurred that [...] "all of the stories set in motion by the first film have been resolved. <b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>ever</b> were another Pirates of the Caribbean film, I would start fresh and focus on the further adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow." ...|$|E
