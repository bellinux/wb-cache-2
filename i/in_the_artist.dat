5|$|<b>In</b> <b>The</b> <b>Artist</b> Among the Missing (1949), Manning {{illustrates}} the racial tensions that are created when imperialism and multiculturalism mix, and, as in her other war novels, evaluates the political bind {{in which the}} British seek to defeat racist Nazism while upholding British colonial exploitation. The School for Love (1951) is the tale of an orphaned boy's journey of disillusionment {{in a city that}} is home to Arabs, Jews and a repressive, colonial presence represented in the novel by the cold, self-righteous, and anti-Semitic character of Miss Bohun.|$|E
25|$|Great art is {{the outward}} {{expression}} of an inner life <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist,</b> and this inner life will result in his personal vision of the world. No amount of skillful invention can replace the essential element of imagination. One of the weaknesses of much abstract painting is the attempt to substitute the inventions of the human intellect for a private imaginative conception.|$|E
25|$|The {{audience}} {{of a typical}} concert will have some understanding of Carnatic music. It is also typical to see the audience tapping out the tala {{in sync with the}} artist's performance. As and when the artist exhibits creativity, the audience acknowledge it by clapping their hands. With experienced artists, towards the middle of the concert, requests start flowing <b>in.</b> <b>The</b> <b>artist</b> usually sings the requests, and it helps in exhibiting the artist's broad knowledge of the several thousand kritis that are in existence.|$|E

25|$|During {{his years}} in British Palestine, Marcel Janco became a noted {{participant}} {{in the development of}} local Jewish art. He was one of the four Romanian Jewish artists who marked the development of Zionist arts and crafts before 1950—the others were Jean David, Reuven Rubin, Jacob Eisenscher; David, who was Janco's friend in Bucharest, joined him in Tel Aviv after an adventurous trip and internment in Cyprus. In particular, Janco was an early influence on three Zionist artists who had arrived to Palestine from other regions: Avigdor Stematsky, Yehezkel Streichman and Joseph Zaritsky. He was soon recognized as a leading presence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> community, receiving Tel Aviv Municipality's Dizengoff Prize in 1945, and again in 1946.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{the talent}} of singing has become competitive. Currently, {{there are several}} {{television}} shows that showcase these talents. American Idol {{was one of the}} prominent of these shows. Debuted in 2002, {{it was one of the}} first singing competition shows.The first singing reality show was Sa Re Ga Ma Pa launched by Zee TV in the 1995..At the American Idol Contestants audition in front of a panel of judges to see if they can move on to the next round in Hollywood, from then, the competition begins. The field of contestants is narrowed down week by week until a winner is chosen. In order to move on to the next round, the contestants fate is determined by public vote. The Voice is another well-known singing competition program. Similar to American Idol, the contestants audition in front of a panel of judges, however, the judges chairs are faced towards the audience during the performance. If the coaches are interested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist,</b> they will press their button signifying they want to coach them. Once the auditions conclude, coaches have their team of artists and the competition begins. Coaches then mentor their artists and they compete to find the best singer. Other well-known singing competitions include The X Factor, America's Got Talent, Rising Star and The Sing-Off.|$|E
25|$|Abramovic {{sat in a}} {{rectangle}} drawn with tape in {{the floor of the}} second floor atrium of the MoMA; theater lights shone on her sitting in a chair and a chair opposite her. Visitors waiting in line were invited to sit individually across from the artist while she maintained eye contact with them. Visitors began crowding the atrium within days of the show opening, some gathering before the exhibit opened each morning to rush for a more preferable place in the line to sit with Abramovic. Most visitors sat with the artist for five minutes or less and the line attracted no attention from museum security except for {{the last day of the}} exhibition when a visitor vomited in line and another began to disrobe. Tensions among visitors in line could have arisen from an understanding that for every minute each person in line spent with Abramovic, there would be that many fewer minutes in the day for those further back in line to spend with the artist. Due to the strenuous nature of sitting for hours at a time, art-enthusiasts have speculated as to whether Abramovic wore an adult diaper to eliminate the need to move to urinate. Others have highlighted the movements she made in between sitters as a focus of analysis, as the only variations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> between sitters were when she would cry if a sitter cried and her moment of physical contact with Ulay, one of the earliest visitors to the exhibition. Abramovic sat across from 1,545 sitters, including Klaus Biesenbach, James Franco, Lou Reed and Bjork; sitters were asked not to touch or speak to the artist. By the end of the exhibit, hundreds of visitors were lining up outside the museum overnight to secure a spot in line the next morning. Abramovic concluded the performance by slipping from the chair where she was seated and rising to a cheering crowd more than ten people deep.|$|E

2500|$|Chagas showed two {{different}} series in 2014. His {{works at the}} 1:54 art fair included large-format portraits that used African masks as a trope to comment on African identity. His [...] "Oikonomo" [...] series of self-portraits with shopping bags over his head were intended to hide his identity behind symbols of globalized capitalism and secondhand consumerism in Luanda—secondhand goods permeate African consumer culture. Some of the bags include imagery such as a [...] "World of Hope" [...] slogan and {{a map of the}} Caribbean islands. This series, originally from 2011, was later shown at the Brooklyn Museum's 2016 [...] "Disguise: Masks and Global African Art" [...] exhibition. Hyperallergic highlighted the performativity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> wearing a Barack Obama bag over his head as kitschy, funny, and like another persona. Later in 2014, at Paris Photo, Chagas showed a portrait photograph series, [...] "Tino Passe", depicting models dressed in contemporary attire and wearing traditional, pre-colonial African masks. The clothes came from street markets and import retailers, while the masks came from a private collection. Hyperallergic described one such image, with its carved wood mask and plaid madras shirt a [...] "delightfully incongruous combination". The prints were made in editions of seven.|$|E
60|$|It is, if I {{can fully}} attain to it, the {{ultimate}} realisation {{of the artistic}} life. For the artistic life is simply self-development. Humility <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> is his frank acceptance of all experiences, just as love <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> is simply the sense of beauty that reveals to the world its body and its soul. In Marius the Epicurean Pater seeks to reconcile the artistic life with the life of religion, in the deep, sweet, and austere sense of the word. But Marius {{is little more than}} a spectator: an ideal spectator indeed, and one to whom it is given 'to contemplate the spectacle of life with appropriate emotions,' which Wordsworth defines as the poet's true aim; yet a spectator merely, and perhaps a little too much occupied with the comeliness of the benches of the sanctuary to notice that it is the sanctuary of sorrow that he is gazing at.|$|E

There was a delicacy, almost a beauty in all her form, {{and at the same}} time a certain attractive grossness of spirit, that made a little spark leap instantly alight in Gerald's eyes.|$|E

60|$|Thirdly, {{these ideas}} are contemptible, because no ideas of power are {{associated}} with them; to the ignorant, imitation, indeed, seems difficult, and its success praiseworthy, but even they can by no possibility see more <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> {{than they do in}} a juggler, who arrives at a strange end by means with which they are unacquainted. To the instructed, the juggler is by far the more respectable artist of the two, for they know sleight of hand to be an art of immensely more difficult acquirement, and to imply more ingenuity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> than a power of deceptive imitation in painting, which requires nothing more for its attainment than a true eye, a steady hand, and moderate industry--qualities which in no degree separate the imitative artist from a watch-maker, pin-maker, or any other neat-handed artificer. These remarks do not apply to the art of the Diorama, or the stage, where the pleasure is not dependent on the imitation, but is the same which we should receive from nature herself, only far inferior in degree. It is a noble pleasure; but we shall see in the course of our investigation, both that it is inferior to that which we receive when there is no deception at all, and why it is so.|$|E
60|$|Absolutely, {{an immense}} disadvantage,--a woodcut never {{can be so}} {{beautiful}} or good {{a thing as a}} painting, or line engraving. But in its own separate and useful way, an excellent thing, because, practiced rightly, it exercises <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist,</b> and summons in you, the habit of abstraction; that is to say, of deciding what are the essential points in the things you see, and seizing these; a habit entirely necessary to strong humanity; and so natural to all humanity, that it leads, in its indolent and undisciplined states, to all the vulgar amateur's liking of sketches better than pictures. The sketch seems to put the thing for him into a concentrated and exciting form.|$|E
60|$|And finally, {{it seems}} to me that even art is utterly {{dependent}} on philosophy: or if you prefer it, on a metaphysic. The metaphysic or philosophy may not be anywhere very accurately stated and may be quite unconscious, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist,</b> yet it is a metaphysic that governs men at the time, and is by all men more or less comprehended, and lived. Men live and see according to some gradually developing and gradually withering vision. This vision exists also as a dynamic idea or metaphysic--exists first as such. Then it is unfolded into life and art. Our vision, our belief, our metaphysic is wearing woefully thin, and the art is wearing absolutely threadbare. We have no future; neither for our hopes nor our aims nor our art. It has all gone gray and opaque.|$|E
