40|$|Abstract. Given <b>a</b> <b>text,</b> grammar-based {{compression}} is {{to construct}} a grammar that generates the text. There are many kinds of text compression techniques of this type.

One representative tactics for off-line compression is to substitute the longest repeated factors of <b>a</b> <b>text</b> with <b>a</b> production rule.

40|$|Cohesion is {{considered}} one of the terms that recently appear in linguistics. It units and elements of <b>a</b> <b>text</b> through using the cohesive links. It gives a great importance for <b>a</b> literary <b>text</b> on the level of a sentence, paragraph, a paragraph in relation to other paragraphs, or <b>a</b> whole <b>text.</b> <b>A</b> <b>text</b> cannot be <b>a</b> cohesive <b>text</b> without such contextual links. Thus, <b>a</b> <b>text</b> is regarded as a disconnected or detached text without these links which function as tools connecting parts of <b>a</b> <b>text</b> to each other making a great achievement in discourse. These links give <b>a</b> <b>text</b> <b>a</b> harmonic tone of infinitive bells that are connected to each other.

This makes cohesion an important and a necessary thing that <b>a</b> <b>text</b> cannot be structured without it. As such, it is said that without cohesion, there will not be <b>a</b> <b>text.</b> In the present study, two devices of the cohesive links will be discussed. They are repetition and demonstrative pronouns which have effective roles in connecting <b>a</b> <b>text</b> first and for their importance in the poet Salih Al-Kwaz,s text, second. They are so prominent and enticing. Al-Kwaz uses them knowingly and intentionally in discourse that makes researchers choose them for the present study. The study contains a theoretical background about cohesion and its importance in modern linguistic studies, and its role in understanding <b>a</b> <b>text</b> and its connection. The first chapter deals with repetition and its implications in Al-Kwaz,s text. The second chapter deals with the demonstrative pronouns, its concepts, and implications.

The different system amongst languages  in forming words, sentences or paragraph might  represent  peculiar form and meaning. As a part of element in determining logical meaning, conjunctive relation can be in the  form of conjunction, verb, noun, preposition and implicit. Those forms signal how unity of <b>a</b> <b>text</b> is constructed. In translation, the use of conjunctive relation forms frequently make problem for translators since it {{is closely related to}} logical meaning in <b>a</b> <b>text.</b>   In translating text, different meaning between two languages should be occasionally translated into different form and meaning of the two languages. To understand <b>a</b> <b>text</b> comprehensively, <b>a</b> reader must know the unity of <b>a</b> <b>text.</b> One of the aspects to determine unity of <b>a</b> <b>text</b> in translation is conjunctive relation.
