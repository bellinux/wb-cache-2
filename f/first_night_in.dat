5|$|In {{preparation}} for Gauguin's visit, Van Gogh bought two beds on {{advice from the}} station's postal supervisor Joseph Roulin, whose portrait he painted. On 17 September he spent his <b>first</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> the still sparsely furnished Yellow House. When Gauguin consented to work and live in Arles with him, Van Gogh started {{to work on the}} Décoration for the Yellow House, probably the most ambitious effort he ever undertook. He completed two chair paintings: Van Gogh's Chair and Gauguin's Chair.|$|E

5|$|Roekiah's last {{film with}} Rd Mochtar, Siti Akbari, was {{released}} in 1940. Possibly inspired by a poem {{of the same name}} by Lie Kim Hok, the film featured Roekiah in the title role, portraying a long-suffering wife who remains faithful to her husband despite his infidelity. The film was well-received, earning 1,000 gulden on its <b>first</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> Surabaya, but was ultimately unable to return profits similar to Terang Boelan or Fatima.|$|E
5|$|In season one, Jenny arrives to {{stay with}} her boyfriend Tim. On her very <b>first</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> Los Angeles, Jenny attends a party with her neighbors Tina and Bette where she meets Marina. Despite knowing of her {{relationship}} with Tim, Marina ambushes Jenny in the toilet and kisses her, and they start an affair, showing Jenny fighting her feelings and questioning her sexuality. Jenny begins to outright lie to Tim and everyone else about her infidelity. When Tim finds out about the affair, he forces Jenny to marry him, but they divorce soon after. She later goes back to Marina, goes on a date with Dana Fairbanks (Erin Daniels) and briefly dates a much older woman, Robin (Anne Ramsay).|$|E

The immense library contains the ramshackle spiral staircase from which the previous owner hanged herself; the vast conservatory is adorned with eerie statues. During their <b>first</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> the house, Eleanor and Theo are terrified by supernatural occurrences outside Theo's bedroom door. Deafening banging is heard against {{the door and the}} voice of a young girl is heard echoing with laughter. Despite the turbulence, Eleanor feels a tentative affinity to Hill House.|$|E

5|$|In contrast, for the North Vietnamese {{the battle}} was {{just one part of}} the May Offensive, {{although}} they later claimed to have killed 800 Australians during a single attack—a fact which may have indicated the importance they placed on it at the time. They had reacted quickly and proficiently to mount a battalion attack on the <b>first</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to push the Australians off their line of communications; however, while the attacks on Coral and Balmoral had been well co-ordinated, the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong had repeatedly surrendered the element of surprise with preparatory fire and poor light discipline alerting the defenders on each occasion. Meanwhile, rigid command-and-control arrangements and a lack of radio communications had forced the North Vietnamese to operate on fixed schedules, preventing them from taking the initiative or responding rapidly to changing situations. Such inflexibility had resulted in predictability, with the communist commanders ultimately committing their forces to a frontal assault on Coral on the first night, and mounting very similar attacks against Balmoral on the nights of 26 and 28 May, both of which ended in costly failures.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the experiment, Zimbardo started off with nine guards and nine prisoners.

25|$|Luger then befriended Barry Windham, {{his former}} Florida ally. They formed a tag team, dubbed The Twin Towers. The Twin Towers first teamed on March 27, 1988 at Clash of the Champions to defeat Tully Blanchard and Arn Anderson for the NWA World Tag Team Championship. Only {{a few weeks}} after the title win, Windham {{suddenly}} turned on Luger during a title defense (against Blanchard and Anderson) and joining Luger's former stable, The Four Horsemen. Days later, the Jim Crockett, Sr. Memorial Cup Tag Team Tournament was held with its <b>first</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> Greenville, South Carolina. A partner-less Luger was teamed with Sting (whose partner Ronnie Garvin had been kayfabe injured) and the impromptu team won the entire tournament, defeating Blanchard and Anderson in the finals.|$|E

25|$|By February 1778 Polk {{returned}} to North Carolina to recruit more soldiers for the Continental Army, but by June 26 he had resigned his commission, aggrieved at being {{passed over for}} promotion to brigadier general {{after the death of}} General Francis Nash. He lost his command of the 4th North Carolina Regiment when, in a reduction of forces, it was combined with the 2nd North Carolina Regiment. In mid–1780 Polk again accepted a commission with the Continental Army, this time serving as commissary general of purchases for both the state of North Carolina and the Continental Army in the southern theater. When Nathanael Greene assumed command of the Continental Army in the southern theater, he met with Polk for an extended time on the general's <b>first</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> the army's camp in order to become familiar with the region's resources.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Marie-José Malis toured, with a French-language version {{created with}} the help of Alain Badiou, {{explicitly}} asking whether there were any other possibility than the death of the Prince, and making discussion on the topic part of the experience of the play. The day before the staging in Arles, on May 14, 2009, she held a public discussion in the theatre, asking the public whether they had any suggestions as to how the play should end, as she herself was still undecided as to how to end the play. This fostering of discussion was itself an important element of the re-staging of the play. In the event, on that <b>first</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> Arles at least, the Prince and Natalia and a soldier friendly to their cause shoot {{their way out of the}} place in which the Prince is to be executed.|$|E
25|$|Sam Malloy (Aidan Mitchell) – Sam, the {{youngest}} Malloy child, is transgender and frequently dresses in feminine clothing. The idea for Sam's non-binary gender expression came about before Izzard—a gender non-conforming comedian—joined the show. Sam's gender expression is accepted and respected {{by their parents}} and siblings. On their <b>first</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> the Rich home, Sam draws a large mural on a bedroom wall depicting the family's recent adventures, including the car accident and Dahlia's release from prison. In addition to artistic skill, Sam is interested in French and very earnest about getting a good education. Like {{the rest of the}} family, Sam appears to be very clever and adept at trickery. In episode 3, Sam is the key player in an elaborate con of Dahlia's to get the Malloy children into Rosemere Academy. During the season 1 finale, Sam expresses reluctance and even denial in leaving Eden Falls.|$|E

25|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century, {{artists such as}} Hale were {{instrumental}} in reviving etching in America and Europe and restoring {{the significance of this}} technical medium. At the forefront of the Etching Revival of Hale's time was artist James Abbott McNeill Whistler, who set the standard for new generation of etchers. Clements first introduced Hale to etching while the pair was traveling in Europe. In terms of the etching process, Hale, like her contemporaries, used copper plates to produce clean, well-defined impressions. Hale experimented with a variety of etching techniques, including hard-ground, soft-ground, aquatint, and color inking. In the etching medium, Hale worked on a more intimate basis, using etchings to document her travels through the U.S., Europe, and the Middle East. Some of Hale’s most accomplished prints include The Willow Whistle, which was produced using hard-ground etching and displayed at the Paris Salon, and <b>First</b> <b>Night</b> <b>in</b> Venice, which used the soft-ground process.|$|E
