By introducing hydrogen during the fabrication of amorphous silicon, photoconductivity is significantly improved and doping is made possible.

The role of hydrogen in reducing defects was verified by Paul's group at Harvard who found a hydrogen concentration of about 10 atomic % through IR vibration, which for Si-H bonds has a frequency of about 2000 cm−1. Starting in the 1970s, a-Si:H was developed in solar cells by RCA by which steadily climbed in efficiency to about 13.6% in 2015.|$|E
