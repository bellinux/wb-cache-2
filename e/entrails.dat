5|$|Recreational {{and sports}} fishers {{can help to}} prevent the spread of the {{parasite}} by not transporting fish from one body of water to another, not disposing of fish bones or <b>entrails</b> in any body of water, and ensuring boots and shoes are clean before moving between different bodies of water. Federal, state, provincial, and local regulations on the use of bait should be followed.|$|E
5|$|In chapter 157 of Njáls saga, a {{man named}} Dörruð {{witnesses}} 12 people riding together to a stone hut on Good Friday in Caithness. The 12 go into the hut and Dörruð can no longer see them. Dörruð goes to the hut, and looks through a chink in the wall. He sees that there are women within, {{and that they have}} set up a particular loom; the heads of men are the weights, the <b>entrails</b> of men are the warp and weft, a sword is the shuttle, and the reels are composed of arrows. The women sing a song called Darraðarljóð, which Dörruð memorizes.|$|E
5|$|Sturm {{left early}} on, but Konietzko {{continued}} performing, {{at one point}} having twenty people in his troupe, which by then was engaged in antics such as fire eating and throwing <b>entrails</b> at audiences. Konietzko then returned to Hamburg, where he joined up with Peter Missing in his new band Missing Foundation. Drummer Nicklaus Schandelmaier, who had recently moved to Hamburg from Frankfurt, also joined the group, and took the stage name En Esch. Although the group did some live performances, Konietzko and Esch dropped out of Missing Foundation before any recordings were made {{and went back to}} work as KMFDM, collaborating with Hamburg-based studio owner Raymond Watts.|$|E
5|$|Mary's {{request to}} be buried in France was refused by Elizabeth. Her body was embalmed and left unburied in a secure lead coffin until her burial, in a Protestant service, at Peterborough Cathedral in late July 1587. Her <b>entrails,</b> removed as part of the {{embalming}} process, were buried secretly within Fotheringhay Castle. Her body was exhumed in 1612 when her son, King James VI and I, ordered that she be reinterred in Westminster Abbey, in a chapel opposite the tomb of Elizabeth I. In 1867, her tomb was opened in an attempt to ascertain the resting place of James I; he was ultimately found with Henry VII, but many of her other descendants, including Elizabeth of Bohemia, Prince Rupert of the Rhine and the children of Anne, Queen of Great Britain, were interred in her vault.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the Peace of Nisibis, Diocletian and Galerius returned to Syrian Antioch. At some time in 299, the emperors took part in a ceremony of sacrifice and divination in an attempt to predict the future. The haruspices were unable to read the <b>entrails</b> of the sacrificed animals and blamed Christians in the Imperial household. The emperors ordered all members of the court to perform a sacrifice to purify the palace. The emperors sent letters to the military command, demanding the entire army perform the required sacrifices or face discharge. Diocletian was conservative in matters of religion, a man faithful to the traditional Roman pantheon and understanding of demands for religious purification, but Eusebius, Lactantius and Constantine state that it was Galerius, not Diocletian, who was the prime supporter of the purge, and its greatest beneficiary. Galerius, even more devoted and passionate than Diocletian, saw political advantage in the politics of persecution. He was willing to break with a government policy of inaction on the issue.|$|E
5|$|Henry campaigned {{throughout}} the autumn, strengthening the southern frontier, and then travelled to Lyons-la-Forêt in November to enjoy some hunting, still apparently healthy. There Henry fell ill– {{according to the}} chronicler Henry of Huntingdon, he ate a number of lampreys against his physician's advice– and his condition worsened {{over the course of}} a week. Once the condition appeared terminal, Henry gave confession and summoned Archbishop Hugh of Amiens, who was joined by Robert of Gloucester and other members of the court. In accordance with custom, preparations were made to settle Henry's outstanding debts and to revoke outstanding sentences of forfeiture. The King died on 1 December 1135, and his corpse was taken to Rouen accompanied by the barons, where it was embalmed; his <b>entrails</b> were buried locally at Port-du-Salut Abbey, and the preserved body was taken on to England, where it was interred at Reading Abbey.|$|E
5|$|Legends {{of female}} vampire-like beings who can detach {{parts of their}} upper body occur in the Philippines, Malaysia, Cambodia and Indonesia. There are two main vampire-like creatures in the Philippines: the Tagalog Mandurugo ("blood-sucker") and the Visayan manananggal ("self-segmenter"). The mandurugo is a variety of the aswang that {{takes the form of}} an {{attractive}} girl by day, and develops wings and a long, hollow, thread-like tongue by night. They use an elongated proboscis-like tongue to suck fetuses off pregnant women. They also prefer to eat <b>entrails</b> (specifically the heart and the liver) and the phlegm of sick people. The manananggal is described as being an older, beautiful woman capable of severing its upper torso in order to fly into the night with huge bat-like wings and prey on unsuspecting, sleeping pregnant women in their homes. The tongue is used to suck up blood from a sleeping victim.|$|E
5|$|St. Paul, Minnesota: in a store, Clyde Bruckman (Peter Boyle), a life {{insurance}} salesman, purchases a {{paper and a}} lottery ticket and leaves. In the street, he almost bumps into an inconspicuous man (Stuart Charno), who heads to a gypsy palm reader named Madame Zelma (Karin Konoval). After seeking his fortune, the inconspicuous man attacks and kills her. A few days later, the eyes and <b>entrails</b> of a tea leaf reader, {{who was also a}} doll collector, have been found in her apartment, her body being missing. FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrive at the scene of that murder to help the local cops, who have recruited the help of a psychic, the eccentric Stupendous Yappi (Jaap Broeker). Although the psychic delivers extremely vague clues, the cops are thoroughly impressed; both Scully and Mulder, however, are not, especially after Yappi diagnoses that it is Mulder—not Scully—who is a skeptic.|$|E
5|$|Vampires have {{appeared}} in Japanese cinema since the late 1950s; the folklore behind it is western in origin. The Nukekubi is a being whose head and neck detach from its body to fly about seeking human prey at night. Legends of female vampire-like beings who can detach parts of their upper body also occur in the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. There are two main vampire-like creatures in the Philippines: the Tagalog Mandurugo ("blood-sucker") and the Visayan Manananggal ("self-segmenter").

5|$|While {{the local}} townspeople believe all Carno's wives {{died of natural}} causes or accidentally, Adrienne learns through a series of visions that he murdered them in {{grotesque}} ways. Hortencia (Christine Armond), who avoided Zoltan's abuse by secluding herself in her greenhouse, is stabbed with gardening tools and suffocated with mulch. Victoria (Holley Chant), an alcoholic, is killed when Zoltan impales her eye with a wine bottle during an argument. An overly talkative third wife, Leonora (Dana Moody), has her mouth gagged and her neck contorted in a torture device. Finally, the food-loving Regina (Wanda Smith) is force-fed animal <b>entrails</b> through a funnel until she chokes to death. Harriet performs a séance for Adrienne, revealing {{in the form of a}} green ectoplasm the spirit of Carno before he had been possessed. He reveals that the previously contained evil spirit has been released, and urges Adrienne to trap it once again.|$|E
5|$|The {{film is a}} {{depiction}} of various scenes, usually violent or bizarre, that somehow relate to hunting. Each scenario is presented {{one after the other}} with little regard for narrative continuity. The opening scene introduces a Patagonian hunter who hunts stags to survive. The opening credits play over as he chases after a stag, which he ultimately shoots, kills, and beheads. Afterwards, one of the numerous scenes of anti-hunting gatherings is shown, this one in Cape Cod. The attention quickly shifts to wildlife hunting, where a monkey is killed by a leopard, and then a squirrel monkey by an anaconda. The theme changes again to the social hunt of wild game in Australia and Africa. Aborigines hunt kangaroos and other large marsupials with spears and giant bats with boomerangs. Indigenous tribes of Africa hunt large game, including antelope, buffalo, and elephants, in the savanna. Religious ceremonies are also shown, where the African hunters proceed to suck fresh blood from the <b>entrails</b> of an antelope, and the Australian aborigines symbolically bury their prey in dust to placate the spirits of the animals. Lastly, two brothers are arrested after partaking in a form of ritual post-mortem cannibalism of three of their relatives to acquire the hunting skills of the dead.|$|E

25|$|The {{bursting}} whale splattered {{blood and}} <b>entrails</b> over surrounding shop fronts, bystanders, and cars.|$|E
25|$|The penanggalan {{is another}} type of female vampire {{attracted}} to the blood of newborn infants, which appears {{as the head of}} a woman from which her <b>entrails</b> trail, used to grasp her victim. There are several stories of her origins. One is that she was a woman who was sitting meditating in a large wooden vat used for making vinegar when she was so startled that her head jumped up from her body, pulling her <b>entrails</b> with it. Another has her as a normal woman during the day, whose head and <b>entrails</b> leave her body at night. If a baby is expected, branches from a type of thistle are placed around the doors or windows to protect the house, since her <b>entrails</b> will be caught by the thorns. The penanggalan is known in Thai as krasue and a similar Philippine ghost called the manananggal which preys on pregnant women with an elongated proboscis-like tongue.|$|E
25|$|In 1757, the Afghani ruler Ahmad Shah Durrani, {{also known}} as Ahmad Shah Abdali, {{attacked}} Amritsar and desecrated the Golden Temple. He had waste poured into the pool along with <b>entrails</b> of slaughtered cows, before departing for Afghanistan. The Sikhs restored it again.|$|E
25|$|In 1762, {{there were}} {{persistent}} {{conflicts with the}} Sikhs. The rebuilt Harminder Sahib was destroyed, and the pool was filled with cow <b>entrails,</b> again. This time the conflict {{was a lot more}} significant, as it resulted in the death of 25,000-30,000 Sikhs.|$|E
25|$|Even the Islamic Prophet Muhammad was {{subjected}} to such abuse; while he was praying near the Kaaba, Aqaba Bin Muiitt threw the <b>entrails</b> of a sacrificed camel over him. Abu Lahab's wife Umm Jamil would regularly dump filth outside his door and placed thorns in the path to his house.|$|E
25|$|Some bog bodies, such as Tollund Man from Denmark, {{have been}} found with the rope used to {{strangle}} them still around their necks. Some, such as the Yde Girl in the Netherlands and bog bodies in Ireland, had the hair {{on one side of}} their heads closely cropped, although this could be due to one side of their head being exposed to oxygen {{for a longer period of}} time than the other. Some of the bog bodies seem consistently to have been members of the upper class: their fingernails are manicured, and tests on hair protein routinely record good nutrition. Strabo records that the Celts practiced auguries on the <b>entrails</b> of human victims: on some bog bodies, such as the Weerdinge Men found in the northern Netherlands, the <b>entrails</b> have been partly drawn out through incisions.|$|E
25|$|Narrated by refugee: There are six temples in the Amsom, all of {{them have}} been {{destroyed}} and desecrated and cows slaughtered in the premises and the idols were garlanded with the <b>entrails</b> and the skulls hung in various places in the temples. Six Hindus have been murdered and about 15 houses burnt by the rebels. About sixty persons were forcibly converted.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the cuisine}} centres on Iceland's fishing industry. Traditional dishes include Hákarl (putrefied shark), gravlax (salmon marinated in salt and dill), hangikjöt (smoked lamb), hrútspungar (pickled ram's testicles), and slátur (sausages made from sheep <b>entrails).</b> A popular food is skyr made of cultured skim milk, {{in the summer}} time it may be served with {{bilberries}} as a dessert. Brennivin is an Icelandic liquor made from potatoes and caraway.|$|E
25|$|These men, {{whom you}} see {{slaughtered}} on the ground, were neither Pagans nor Mahometans, at whose death we should rejoice—they were Christians, lately your subjects and your countrymen, {{some of them}} your relations. This is not victory, which is gained over ourselves. In killing these, you drive the sword into your own <b>entrails.</b> How many men have you slaughtered? How many more have you to kill? We have become a proverb, even among the Pagans and Moors, for carrying on this war, and apostatizing, as they say, from the faith of our ancestors.|$|E
25|$|Some mutilations {{are said}} to occur in very brief periods. A 2002 NIDS report relates a 1997 case from Utah. Two ranchers tagged a {{specific}} calf, then continued tagging other animals in the same pasture. The ranchers were, at the most, about 300 yards from the calf. Less than an hour later, the first calf was discovered completely eviscerated—most muscle and all internal organs were missing. There was no blood, <b>entrails,</b> or apparent disturbance at the scene. Independent analysts both uncovered marks on the calf's remains consistent with {{two different types of}} tools: a large, machete-type blade, and smaller, more delicate scissors.|$|E
25|$|Tepcuaraq (tepcuar(aq) or tepcuaraq kumlaneq) is {{fish that}} has been frozen after being allowed to age slightly, eaten {{uncooked}} and frozen. Kumlaneq is aged spawned out salmon. Tepcuaraq kumlaneq is aged and frozen fish. The whole fish can be either cleaned of their <b>entrails</b> or left intact, then buried under ground in a pit lined with grass and left {{for about a week}} depending on the temperature. If the fish are caught in the late fall, they are stored in a wooden or cardboard box until they are aged, and then frozen. Tepcuaraq kumlaneq are eaten frozen with seal oil.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to Ovid, other Roman writers also mentioned lycanthropy. Virgil wrote {{of human beings}} transforming into wolves. Pliny the Elder relates two tales of lycanthropy. Quoting Euanthes, he mentions a man who hung his clothes on an ash tree and swam across an Arcadian lake, transforming him into a wolf. On the condition that he attack no human being for nine years, he {{would be free to}} swim back across the lake to resume human form. Pliny also quotes Agriopas regarding a tale {{of a man who was}} turned into a wolf after tasting the <b>entrails</b> of a human child, but was restored to human form 10 years later.|$|E
25|$|On 24 November 1326…Despenser was roped to four horses…and {{dragged through}} {{the city to the}} walls of his own castle, where {{enormous}} gallows had been specially constructed…Despenser was raised a full 50 feet…and was lowered onto the ladder. A man climbed along side him sliced off his penis and testicles, flinging them into the fire below…he then plunged a knife into Despenser's abdomen and cut out his <b>entrails</b> and heart…the corpse was lowered to the ground and the head cut off. It was later sent to London, and Despenser's arms, torso and legs were sent to be displayed above the gates of Newcastle, York, Dover and Bristol.|$|E
25|$|Even if {{the eve of}} the Passover fell on a Sabbath, the paschal lamb {{was killed}} in the manner {{described}} above, the blood was sprinkled on the altar, the <b>entrails</b> removed and cleansed, and the fat offered on the altar; for these four ceremonies {{in the case of the}} paschal lamb, and these alone, were exempt from the prohibition against working on the Sabbath. This regulation, that the Sabbath yielded the precedence to the Passover, was not definitely determined until the time of Hillel, who established it as a law and was in return elevated to the dignity of nasi by Judah ben Bathyra.(B.Pesachim 68a).|$|E
25|$|Dog food (qimugcin, qimugcitkaq, qimugcessuun) {{refers to}} {{food for the}} dogs. Alunga is {{homemade}} dog food (a boiled mixture of fish and meat products) and Alungun is dog-feeding trough. Salmon is the best food to feed (nerqe-) dogs. Chum, coho, and pink salmon were the species most frequently processed for dog food. In addition to dried salmon processed for dog food, whole uncut salmon and the heads, <b>entrails,</b> and backbones, not preserved or prepared for dog food, were also used as dog food. Chum salmon harvested during August for use as dog food were usually dried. Between late August and early October, coho salmon harvested for dog food were preserved by burying whole in earthen pits.|$|E
25|$|According to tradition, Attila had his diviners {{examine the}} <b>entrails</b> of a {{sacrifice}} {{the morning of}} the day of the battle. They foretold that disaster would befall the Huns, but one of the enemy leaders would be killed. Attila delayed until the ninth hour (about 2:30 PM) so the impending sunset would help his troops to flee the battlefield in case of defeat. Hughes takes his own interpretation of this, noting that the divination may be an emphasis of Attila's barbarity and therefore possibly a fabrication. He states that the choice to begin the battle at the ninth hour was due to the fact both sides spent the whole day carefully deploying their coalition armies.|$|E
25|$|Following {{this final}} stanza a prose section details that after Loki left the hall, he {{disguised}} {{himself as a}} salmon and hid in the waterfall of Franangrsfors, where the Æsir caught him. The narrative continues that Loki was bound with the <b>entrails</b> of his son Nari, and his son Narfi changed into a wolf. Skaði fastened a venomous snake over Loki's face, and from it poison dripped. Sigyn, Loki's wife, sat with him holding a basin beneath the dripping venom, yet when the basin became full, she carried the poison away; and during this time the poison dripped on to Loki, causing him to writhe with such violence {{that all of the}} earth shook from the force, resulting in what are now known as earthquakes.|$|E
25|$|Umlikaaq (or Umlikaq ~ Umlikqaq) or Ungllekaq (ungllik'ar in Nunivak Cup'ig) {{is fresh}} boiled fish. All {{parts of the}} fish except for the <b>entrails</b> are used to prepare umlikqaq. Fresh fish that have been dead {{for less than a}} day make the best umlikqaq because the meat is still firm. If a {{freshwater}} fish is caught with a hook, it is best to kill the fish by hitting its head soon after capture so the meat will stay firm for cooking. The main ingredients of umlikqaq are cut-up fish, water, and salt which are boiled for about 29 minutes. This is a preferred food for elders because it easy to make and is not strongly seasoned. First heads are good prepared as umlikqaq. Also, Ungelkaaq is fish steak cut transversely.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} of homo sapiens {{to the other}} animals is one of unremitting exploitation. We employ their work; we eat and wear them. We exploit them to serve our superstitions: whereas we used to sacrifice them to our gods and tear out their <b>entrails</b> in order to foresee the future, we now sacrifice them to science, and experiment on their entail in the hope—or on the mere off chance—that we might thereby see a little more clearly into the present... To us it seems incredible that the Greek philosophers should have scanned so deeply into right and wrong and yet never noticed the immorality of slavery. Perhaps 3000 years from now it will seem equally incredible {{that we do not}} notice the immorality of our own oppression of animals.|$|E
25|$|Assaliaq (assaliq; lit. «fried thing»; also, pancake; other fried food; fry bread) {{is fresh}} fried fish. All {{parts of the}} fish except the <b>entrails</b> are used to prepare this dish, {{although}} often the heads are removed as well. The fish is filleted, dipped in seasoned flour, or just seasoned with salt, and fried in oil. If households enjoy picking and sucking backbones or only a few fish are available, the backbone will be fried along with the filleted pieces. Heads are sometimes fried for the same reasons. Boiled rice is the favorite side dish with this meal. Middle aged and younger people enjoy this meal for the flavor. The verb assali- (to fry; to make pancakes or griddlecakes) is derived from Russian жа́рить (zhárit’) ‘to roast, fry, broil, grill’.|$|E
25|$|Identifying {{skeletal}} remains {{is a very}} sensitive research subject at the farm. With a new age and generation, {{there has been a}} paradigm shift in methods to identify the <b>entrails</b> of victims. With innovations and adaptation to change, computers are able to identify properties of bone matter that has been buried years beginning at the Forensic Anthropology Data Bank founded in 1986 at the University of Texas, which houses thousands of detailed measurements of skeletons. This data provides strong evidence that shows differences in ethnic background from ancient times to present today. Along with the data bank, technological innovations have given researchers a computer tool called FORDISC. This program is used to evaluate subtleties in a bone sample on a much smaller scale, which can confirm or challenge theories and/or conclusions drawn by investigators.|$|E
25|$|Polybius also blamed Demetrius' {{influence}} for Philip's tyrannical behavior. One incident involved Philip's apparent role in {{a massacre}} {{carried out by the}} people against their leaders that occurred at Messene in 215 BC. Arriving on the scene the day after the massacre and wanting to seize the acropolis, Philip asked his advisors whether the <b>entrails</b> of a sacrifice which had been made indicated that he should quit the citadel or hold it. Demetrius responded by saying: if you have the heart of an augur, quit it as quick as you can, but as a gallant and wise king, keep it, lest if you quit it now you may never have so good an opportunity again, for it is by thus holding the two horns that you can alone keep the ox under your control.|$|E
25|$|Followers of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad {{believe that}} this prophecy was {{fulfilled}} on Saturday 6 March 1897 which {{happened to be a}} day after the festival of Eid, when Pandit Lekh Ram was brutally stabbed with a dagger by a stranger who it is said turned the knife round and round in his stomach thus cutting his <b>entrails</b> thoroughly. Lekh Ram died the next day. It is said that although his family was at home, and there were some men downstairs, near the gate {{at the time of the}} murder, no one saw any person entering or leaving the house. His body was subsequently cremated in accordance with Hindu custom and the remains dispersed of in a river. There was a police investigation but it failed to apprehend the murderer.|$|E
