When MacLeod tells Tessa that she is stronger than Anne, and that <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>happened</b> to him she would be fine, Tessa retorts, [...] "You only think so because it suits you." [...] The murderer is Chief Police Officer Andrew Ballin (Tom Butler) who is beheaded by MacLeod after Ballin failed to kill Tessa.|$|E

50|$|The gambler's fallacy, {{also known}} as the Monte Carlo fallacy or the fallacy of the {{maturity}} of chances, is the mistaken belief that, <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>happens</b> more frequently than normal during some period, it will happen less frequently in the future, or that, <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>happens</b> less frequently than normal during some period, it will happen more frequently in the future (presumably as a means of balancing nature). In situations where what is being observed is truly random (i.e., independent trials of a random process), this belief, though appealing to the human mind, is false. This fallacy can arise in many practical situations, but is most strongly associated with gambling, where such mistakes are common among players.|$|R

[...] "I could tell you something {{you would like to}} know," [...] Cornelius mumbled crossly. Brown paid no attention. [...] "You did not kill him," [...] went on the other, [...] "and what do you get for it? You might have had money from the Rajah, besides the loot of all the Bugis houses, and now you get nothing." [...] "You had better clear out from here," [...] growled Brown, without even looking at him. But Cornelius let himself drop by his side and began to whisper very fast, touching his elbow from time to time. What he had to say made Brown sit up at first, with a curse. He had simply informed him of Dain Waris's armed party down the river. At first Brown saw himself completely sold and betrayed, but a moment's reflection convinced him that there could be no treachery intended. He said nothing, and after a while Cornelius remarked, in a tone of complete indifference, that there was another way out of the river which he knew very well. [...] "A good thing to know, too," [...] said Brown, pricking up his ears; and Cornelius began to talk of what went on in town and repeated all that had been said in council, gossiping in an even undertone at Brown's ear as you talk amongst sleeping men you do not wish to wake. [...] "He thinks he has made me harmless, does he?" [...] mumbled Brown very low. [...] "Yes. He is a fool. A little child. He came here and robbed me," [...] droned on Cornelius, [...] "and he made all the people believe him. But <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>happened</b> that they did not believe him any more, where would he be? And the Bugis Dain who is waiting for you down the river there, captain, is the very man who chased you up here when you first came." [...] Brown observed nonchalantly that it would be just as well to avoid him, and with the same detached, musing air Cornelius declared himself acquainted with a backwater broad enough to take Brown's boat past Waris's camp. [...] "You will have to be quiet," [...] he said as an afterthought, [...] "for in one place we pass close behind his camp. Very close. They are camped ashore with their boats hauled up." [...] "Oh, we know how to be as quiet as mice; never fear," [...] said Brown. Cornelius stipulated that in case he were to pilot Brown out, his canoe should be towed. [...] "I'll have to get back quick," [...] he explained.|$|E
