5|$|<b>First</b> <b>responder</b> – A {{person who}} arrives {{first at the}} scene of an incident, and whose job is to provide early {{critical}} care such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or using an automated external defibrillator (AED). First responders may be dispatched by the ambulance service, may be passers-by, or may be dispatched to the scene from other agencies, such as the police or fire departments.|$|E
5|$|Use of an {{automated}} external defibrillator on a patient in a metal underwire bra can cause burns, and the bra should be removed by the <b>first</b> <b>responder</b> before the AED is applied. In their 2007 season, the television program MythBusters tested the possibility of burns resulting from using a defibrillator on a patient who is using an underwire bra, and concluded that while it is possible, {{it is not likely}} unless the metal underwire is exposed and paddles of the defibrillator are very close to it.|$|E
5|$|Trained {{research}} teams {{were already on}} the ground on Java responding to the May earthquake and began a {{survey of more than}} one hundred Muslim farmers, plantation laborers, and fishermen (or those with fishing-related occupations) that were affected by the tsunami. Almost two thirds of the group reported that they lived in permanent structures made of wood, brick, or cement, while the remainder lived in semi-permanent facilities made from earth or stone. The government was cited as the <b>first</b> <b>responder</b> for water, relocation and medical assistance, and helping with the deceased. For rescue, shelter, clothing, and locating missing people, individuals were listed as the primary provider, but 100% of those surveyed replied that the government should be responsible for relief. Most of those requiring aid stated that they were given effective assistance within 48 hours and that they were satisfied with the help.|$|E

50|$|<b>First</b> <b>responders</b> must {{be trained}} {{to deal with a}} wide array of {{potential}} medical emergencies. Because of the high level of stress and uncertainty associated with the position, <b>first</b> <b>responders</b> must maintain physical and mental health. Even with such preparation, <b>first</b> <b>responders</b> face unique risks of being the first people to aid those with unknown contagions. For example, in 2003 <b>first</b> <b>responders</b> were among the earliest victims of the previously unknown SARS virus, when they cared for patients affected with the virus.|$|R
50|$|The World Trade Center <b>first</b> <b>responders</b> (e.g., {{police and}} fire fighters) and the city {{conflicted}} with {{each other over the}} issue of payments for health costs of survivors among the <b>first</b> <b>responders.</b> On October 17, 2006 federal judge Alvin K. Hellerstein rejected New York City's motion to dismiss lawsuits that requested health payments to the <b>first</b> <b>responders.</b>|$|R
25|$|The <b>first</b> <b>responder</b> {{training}} {{is considered a}} bare minimum for emergency service workers who may be sent out {{in response to an}} emergency call. It is almost always required for professional and volunteer firefighters. For example, all firefighters of the New York City Fire Department require a valid CFR-D (Certified <b>First</b> <b>Responder</b> - Defibrillation) certification. The <b>first</b> <b>responder</b> level of emergency medical {{training is}} also often required for police officers, rescue squad personnel, and search and rescue personnel. Many first responders have location specific training such as water rescue or mountain rescue and must take advanced courses to be certified (i.e. lifeguard).|$|E
25|$|Ito is a PADI IDC Staff Instructor, an Emergency <b>First</b> <b>Responder</b> Instructor Trainer, and a Divers Alert Network (DAN) Instructor Trainer.|$|E
25|$|Private {{ambulance}} services also participate (as <b>first</b> <b>responder)</b> to the Urgent Medical Aid Service {{but they are}} not a substitute for advanced medical care only rendered by doctors.|$|E
5000|$|Examples of <b>first</b> <b>responders</b> include [...] "co-responders" [...] (police or fire service), {{members of}} staff of a {{shopping}} mall or other public place, members of a first aid organisation, lifeguards, community <b>first</b> <b>responders,</b> {{and others who have}} been trained to act in this capacity. Employees of the statutory ambulance services may also act as <b>first</b> <b>responders</b> whilst off-duty.|$|R

25|$|Firefighters in the United States are {{frequently}} the first responders to hazmat incidents. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration standard 1910.120 defines four standards of training <b>first</b> <b>responder</b> awareness level, <b>first</b> <b>responder</b> operations level, hazardous materials technician, and Hazardous materials specialist. EMS-based paramedics are typically trained to the awareness level, whereas career and volunteer firefighters are often trained to the operations level or better. Other nations have trained only elite firefighters and rescuers to do hazmat so that funding and equipment {{could go to}} fewer stations. This gives departments elite hazmat personnel and high-grade equipment for an incident. Departments place these companies in stations {{where they can be}} very mobile.|$|E
50|$|The National <b>First</b> <b>Responders</b> Organization (NFRO) is an {{organization}} of <b>first</b> <b>responders</b> in the United States. Formed in 2006 and began accepting memberships in June 2009, it claims a rapidly growing membership.|$|R

25|$|Skillwise, a {{certified}} <b>first</b> <b>responder</b> in the US is often trained {{and allowed to}} do most of what an emergency medical technician is allowed to.

40|$|In {{the midst}} of the post- 2016 {{political}} crisis, our role as academics is that of <b>First</b> <b>Responders.</b> In physical crises, like a fire, <b>First</b> <b>Responders</b> play an important role. They intentionally put themselves in harm’s way to fulfill an overarching purpose of helping others, even at their own risk. They strategically prepare, train, and work for years to prepare for this role in {{the midst of}} crisis. As academics who care about equality, we are <b>First</b> <b>Responders...</b>|$|R
25|$|In some {{communities}} a fire apparatus, often a paramedic engine, {{will be used}} to carry <b>first</b> <b>responder</b> firefighters, paramedics or EMTs to medical emergencies because of their faster response times due to forward staging in the city.

40|$|Abstract—The {{interpretation}} {{and use of}} standard triage protocols differ widely among <b>first</b> <b>responders.</b> We believe that experience among <b>first</b> <b>responders</b> is {{a major cause of}} these differences. The intent of this study is twofold; to present a novel design for an experimental architecture to observe <b>first</b> <b>responders</b> perform triage, and to use the experimental architecture in a pilot study to explore the hypotheses that expert <b>first</b> <b>responders</b> deviate from standard triage protocols, and experience makes expert <b>first</b> <b>responders</b> deviate from standard triage protocols and leads to more accurate triage assessments because experts consider physiological variables not looked at in standard triage protocols and recognize subtle physiological trends indicative of injury. Results from the pilot study demonstrated that particular physiological information given to expert subjects consistently caused the expert subjects to assign a higher triage assessment category than the START protocol dictated. This key physiological information included drops in the oxygen saturation level, prolonged airway obstruction, and signs of a serious internal injury...|$|R

25|$|As {{there is}} for storm chaser conduct, there is concern about chaser responsibility.
