50|$|Casual relationships, being a mix {{between a}} {{friendship}} and a non-romantic sexual relationship, {{result in the}} partners facing many challenges in maintaining a working relationship. Based on the exchange theory, Hughes witnessed an individual dependency on either partner as the exchange of resources, knowledge, rewards, and costs of items, {{becomes more and more}} prominent. The partners may become dependent on advice the other partner gives, or the company they receive when being around one another. This may be a one-way street and one partner may not feel this way. Any partner that is not fully dependent upon the other typically controls the casual relationship. The <b>dependent</b> <b>partner</b> is more submissive to their dominant partner as they do not want the relationship to end. This allows the less <b>dependent</b> <b>partner</b> to be able to fix and maintain the relationship the way he/she wants it to be. They normally control when they meet up, when they have sex, and when they do things together.|$|E

40|$|In {{contemporary}} Western populations, {{some physical}} characteristics are sexually dimorphic, {{and it is}} known that these traits also affect human mate preferences. Height is one such characteristic, and evidence suggests that females prefer taller over shorter males, indeed, taller males have been found to have greater reproductive success. However, relative height is also important with 'Sexual Dimorphism in Stature' (SDS) calculated as male height/female height. Pawlowski (2003) showed that people adjust their preferences for SDS in relation to their own height in order to increase their potential pool of partners. The aim {{of the present study was}} to replicate Pawlowski's study on a larger sample of participants, and to investigate the universality of the reported preference adjustment within European societies. We present data of 1102 men and women from three countries (Germany, Austria, and the UK) that confirm Pawlowski's original data on a Polish sample. Moreover, the mechanism of an adjustment of SDS preferences in relation to own height was found in all three countries, suggesting that height <b>dependent</b> <b>partner</b> preference is a genuine feature in Western societies...|$|E

40|$|The {{checkpoint}} kinases ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ATM and Rad 3 related) transduce genomic stress {{signals to}} halt cell cycle progression and promote DNA repair. We report the identiÞcation of an ATR-interacting protein (ATRIP) that is phosphorylated by ATR, regulates ATR expression, {{and is an}} essential component of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway. ATR and ATRIP both localize to intranuclear foci after DNA damage or inhibition of replication. Deletion of ATR mediated by the Cre recombinase caused the loss of ATR and ATRIP expression, loss of DNA damage checkpoint responses, and cell death. Therefore, ATR is essential for the viability of human somatic cells. Small interfering RNA directed against ATRIP caused the loss of both ATRIP and ATR expression and the loss of checkpoint responses to DNA damage. Thus, ATRIP and ATR are mutually <b>dependent</b> <b>partners</b> in cell cycle checkpoint signaling pathways.

Determination, agreement and {{the will of the}} married couple for participation in this case study concerning alcohol use and its effects on their coexistence. Objectives and research questions: The main objective of this thesis was to investigate the coexistence of an alcohol-dependent husband with abstinent wife. The main research question was: How is the coexistence of <b>dependent</b> <b>partner</b> with abstinent wife? Additional research questions were: 1) Does, the coexistence look as harmonic {{in the eyes of the}} couple and does it fulfil the image of the ideal partnership? 2) What is the role of the respondents in the partnership - is there a sign of co-dependency? 3) Which are the relaps prevention techniques the wife use for maintaining the abstinence? 4) What circumstance or situations may motivate the husband to quit alcohol use?

40|$|Despite an {{apparently}} thorough ‘due diligence ’ process, many {{mergers and acquisitions}} (M&A) still fail to meet pre-merger objectives. One of the main contributing factors is insufficient emphasis on post-merger relationships, {{and the development of}} an emergent culture to support the new organizational form. Two examples of M&A are used here to illustrate a successful and a dysfunctional application of post-merger integration, seen from a complexity theory perspective. An ideal post-merger integration, according to complexity, would resemble the creation of a child. It has some characteristics inherited from both parents but it has its own unique personality and identity. Yet in most cases the more dominant partner tries to impose its own culture, ways of working and procedures. It expects the <b>dependent</b> <b>partner</b> to adapt to these conditions, instead of facilitating reciprocal learning and co-evolution between the partners. This article explores the differences in attitude of the two companies and identifies some of the key contributing factors to successful co-evolutionary integration from a complexity theory perspective. It does so by outlining the relevant characteristics to M&A of organizations as complex evolving systems. Finally, it proposes that co-evolutionary integration may be facilitated by using the logic of complexity and the co-creation of an enabling infrastructure...|$|E

According to the mainstream IPE scholarship, higher the economic dependence, more prone the <b>dependent</b> <b>partner</b> is to make political compromises {{for the benefit of}} the dominant. Though, this logic is not applicable to the case of the Georgia-Russia relations which is why economic nationalism - as the construction of set of discourses which define frame for the economic policy decisions - is brought into analysis to suggest better explanation of the connection between economic and political dependence. The 2003 - 2016 period is chosen as the time frame for the analysis where 2003 - 2007 and 2012 - 2016 years are analyzed with utmost scrutiny since they correspond to the periods when the governments of Georgia made contrasting policy actions towards relations with Russia: resisted to make compromises in the foreign policy when the economic dependence on Russia was high in 2006 - 2007 and turned to the concessions when the economic dependence was the lowest in the history of Russia-Georgia relations. The thesis elaborates a novel methodology combining the quantitative and qualitative techniques and finds that economic nationalism gives relevance to the economic dependence and triggers political concessions from the decision-makers...|$|E

Its objective was to establish whether or not a common set of reactions and/or symptoms is experienced by those who co-exist with a chemically <b>dependent</b> <b>partner.</b> This was accomplished by systematically analyzing the most frequently cited variables, hypothesized {{to be part of the}} construct of co-dependency via a new co-dependency validation instrument. To date, no such instrument exists. The procedure consisted of an initial content validation process whereby a panel of seven field experts evaluated 18 variables and 243 test items. The evaluation processes included ranking, weighing and rating measures. The results were analyzed and used to develop a 90 question questionnaire which was deemed as representative of the co-dependency domain. This instrument was then subjected to the reliability, construct and criterion-related validation study.

40|$|Since the 1980 s a {{new wave}} of {{globalization}} has caused dramatic increase in foreign investments in less developed countries (LDC), restructuring their international trade relations. In this context, social scientists have asked about the effects of international economic relationships on social and economic development in LDCs. Most of the previous research on this question focused on national levels of foreign direct investment (FDI), or the (national) level of concentration of FDI, or trade dependence. Researchers in the dependency theory tradition argued that poor countries with a highly concentrated FDI generate a pattern of dependency. High investment concentration by a single or a small number of investing countries limits the autonomy of state and business elites to act in the long term interest of domestic growth in the host country. Similarly, dependency theorists have found that dominance of foreign capital allowed the investing country to obtain and maintain a significant advantage over its <b>dependent</b> <b>partner.</b> Other subset of studies in that tradition focuses on the relationship between economic dependence and food security. One recent study argues that the effects of FDI on food security depend on how FDI is distributed among economic sectors (primary manufacturing, service). The existing research on this topic has not, however, given enough attention to the physical presence of multinational corporations (MNCs) as a distinct form of international economic relationship. If we turn our attention to the physical presence of MNC facilities, then we have these new questions concerning local-level effects of the presence of foreign capital in LDCs.

40|$|The {{study focused}} on the expenences of Xhosa-speaking couples in {{relationships}} characterized by alcohol dependency. The goal was to generate {{greater understanding of the}} descriptions of relationship issues faced by alcohol dependent respondents and their partners. Specifically, the {{study focused on}} exploring how the alcohol dependent respondents relate to their partners, their behaviour at home when drinking prior to their admission for rehabilitation, the experiences of their partners in living with alcohol <b>dependent</b> <b>partners</b> and how they coped with the situation. In order to meet this goal, literature and empirical studies were conducted. The literature study focuses on the alcohol dependent individual's behaviour, his emotions, relapse, the family's coping strategies, alcohol and marital problems {{and the role of the}} social worker as part of the rehabilitation team. During the empirical research phase, a non-probability purposive sampling procedure was adopted. Fifteen alcohol dependent clients who were admitted for treatment and rehabilitation at Thembelitsha Rehabilitation Centre (TRC) were selected. These clients were admitted to TRC during the period starting from January 1997 to June 1999 and were discharged to their homes during the research study. To collect data, interviews were conducted separately to a total of thirty respondents. Two interview schedules were used, one for the alcohol dependent respondents (Appendix A) and the other for their partners (Appendix B). This study revealed a remarkable consistency in the descriptions of relationship issues faced by alcohol dependent respondents and their partners. These are abusive behaviours by alcohol <b>dependent</b> respondents. The <b>partners</b> were reluctant and feared challenging the behaviour. The way in which partners responded to drinking and the reactions of alcohol dependent respondents are indicative of the difficult issues faced by the couples.

We aimed at characterizing insured with debt enforcement proceedings {{with respect to}} socio-demographic and health utilization aspects. MethodsCross-sectional analysis of 508. 000 insured with basic health insurance contracts in 2013, of whom 14, 000 (2. 8 %) with debt enforcement proceedings, from 11 Swiss cantons. Groups were characterized using logistic regression and latent class analysis. ResultsInsured with debt enforcement proceedings {{were more likely to}} be young, male and without <b>dependents</b> (<b>partner,</b> kids). Having no supplementary insurance and receiving partial premium subsidies was associated with an increased debt enforcement proceedings risk. Within the debt enforcement proceedings group, three subgroups were identified: 60 % were young and seemingly healthy, with a below-average fraction of premium subsidy recipients (18 %) and low out-of-pocket payments in prior year (median Swiss Francs 0). Two groups consisted of relatively ill elderly persons (22 %, 99 % of whom with chronic illnesses) or families (18 %), many of whom (29 % and 51 %) were recipients of premium subsidies. Median out-of-pocket payments in the prior year were high (Swiss Francs 625 and 688, respectively).

40|$|Marriage, Cohabitation and Collective Responsibility for Dependency: Recently, {{the privileged}} {{legal status of}} {{marriage}} has become the subject of political and academic controversy. Some feminist critics argue that marriage, the source of women's subordination, is outmoded as a family form and that its privileged status should abolished {{in favor of the}} caretaker-dependant dyad. Others argue that informal cohabitation unions should be subject to the same legal treatment as marriage. Representative of this approach is a recent A. L. I. proposal that creates a domestic partnership status for cohabiting couples. On {{the other side of the}} debate, most defenders of marriage tend to be religious and social conservatives who favor traditional marriage on moral grounds. In this essay, I offer a utilitarian defense of the special status of marriage (including same-sex marriage) as family form that promotes social welfare because it functions relatively well to satisfy individual dependency needs. Legal marriage allows couples to register their commitment and choose a formal status with a package of clearly defined and enforceable legal rights, privileges, and obligations. Even today, marriage represents a relatively stable family form, because of its formal status and because it is regulated by a set of social norms that reinforce commitment. I argue that even marriages that end in divorce serve more effectively than other family forms to provide financial security for dependent family members. Informal unions, in contrast, are less reliable, because the behavioral expectations and financial obligations between the parties are uncertain and legal enforcement is difficult. Government privileging of marriage and neutrality toward informal unions does not mean that financial understandings between parties in cohabitation relationships should be unenforceable. I argue that contract theory supports a default rule framework that presumes that property acquired during long term unions is shared and that support is available to <b>dependent</b> <b>partners.</b> Such default rules will mitigate the harsh inequity that results today when courts decide that parties' understandings are too ambiguous for contractual enforcement. This autonomy-based framework is superior to the approach of the A. L. I. Principles, under which an unchosen status is imposed on unmarried couples. ...|$|R

East Germany represents a special case among transitional economies because it literally was taken over by West Germany, setting in motion a rapid transformation of East German institutions and employment structures. The analysis shows that women in the West became less <b>dependent</b> on their <b>partner</b> between 1990 and 2002, largely because fewer women were housewives without earnings. In contrast, women in the East saw their economic contributions to the family economy fall between 1990 and 1996, making them more <b>dependent</b> on their <b>partner</b> and social transfers. Between 1996 and 2002, however, women in East Germany regained some of their economic power, to a great extent because their partners were finding it increasingly difficult to sustain employment.
