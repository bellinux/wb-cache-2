5000|$|A guestbook (also guest book, visitor log, visitors' book, visitors' album) is a {{paper or}} {{electronic}} means for {{a visitor to}} acknowledge {{a visit to a}} site, physical or web-based, and leave details such as their name, postal or <b>electronic</b> <b>address,</b> and any comments. Such paper-based ledgers or books are traditional in churches, at weddings, funerals, B&Bs, museums, schools, institutions and other private facilities open to the public. Some private homes keep visitors' books. Specialised forms of guestbooks include hotel registers, wherein guests are required to provide their contact information, and Books of Condolence, which are used at funeral homes and more generally after notable public deaths, such as the death of a monarch or president, or after a public disaster, such as an airplane crash.On the web, a guestbook is a logging system that allows visitors of a website to leave a public comment. [...] It is possible in some guestbooks for visitors to express their thoughts about the website or its subject. Generally, they do not require the poster to create a user account, as it is an informal method of dropping off a quick message. The purpose of a website guestbook is to display the kind of visitors the site gets, including the part of the world they reside in, and gain feedback from them. This allows the webmaster to assess and improve their site. A guestbook is generally a script, which is usually remotely hosted and written in a language such as Perl, PHP, Python or ASP. Many free guestbook hosts and scripts exist.|$|E
40|$|There is {{increasing}} interest in using electronic mail and other electronic health technologies (e-health technologies) in patient follow-ups. This study {{sheds light on}} patients' reception of provider-initiated e-health in their everyday environments. In a research project carried out in Norway (2005 - 2007), an <b>electronic</b> <b>address</b> for a hospital dermatology ward was offered to 50 patient families for improved access to expert advice from the patients' homes. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 12 families, this paper explores how the <b>electronic</b> <b>address</b> was integrated into everyday health practice. The research illuminates how the <b>electronic</b> <b>address</b> did not only represent changes related to treatment procedures and frequency or nature of expert contact; it was also important to other practices in the everyday lives of the families of patients with chronic illness. Once in place on the patients' computers, the <b>electronic</b> <b>address</b> was ascribed at least four different roles: it {{was used as the}} intended riverbed for a flow of information, but also as a safety alarm, as a shield to the medical gaze and as a token of competence in care and parenting. The multiplicity in use and reception of an <b>electronic</b> <b>address</b> in patient settings illustrates the need to include patients' everyday practices in current professional and political discussions of e-mail and other e-health technologies. Thus this paper argues {{that there is a need}} for research on electronic patient-provider communication that moves beyond frequency of use and questions on how technology will affect medical encounters. Social science equally needs to investigate how provider-initiated e-health technologies gets involved in patients' moral and social performance of health and illness in everyday life.

Statistical physicists are constantly developing new computational and theoretical tools to unravel the complex behavior of systems composed by many simple, interacting units.
