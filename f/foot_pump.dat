40|$|Mechanical {{prophylaxis}} with <b>foot</b> <b>pumps</b> {{provides an}} interesting alternative to chemical {{agents in the}} prevention of thromboembolic disease following major orthopaedic surgical procedures. Recent studies have suggested that the simultaneous use of graduated compression stockings (GCS) may hinder the pneumatic compression effect of <b>foot</b> <b>pumps.</b> The hypothesis of this prospective study was that the use of <b>foot</b> <b>pumps</b> without GCS does not affect the efficacy of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis and improves patient compliance. A total of 846 consecutive patients admitted at a single institution undergoing total hip (THR) or knee replacement (TKR) were included in the study. The A-V Impulse System foot-pump unit (Orthofix Vascular Novamedix, Andover, UK) was used in all patients. Of these 846 patients, 46 discontinued the use of <b>foot</b> <b>pumps,</b> leaving 400 patients who received <b>foot</b> <b>pumps</b> in combination with GCS and 400 patients with <b>foot</b> <b>pumps</b> alone. Eleven patients of the stocking group (2. 7 %) and nine patients of the no-stocking group (2. 3 %) developed postoperative symptomatic DVT (p[*]=[*] 0. 07). DVT was more frequent in TKR (10 / 364; 2. 7 %) than in THR (10 / 436; 2. 3 %). Non-fatal pulmonary embolism occurred in four of the 20 patients with symptomatic DVT, two patients each of the stocking and no-stocking groups. The foot-pump discontinuation rate of patients treated with stockings was 7 % versus 4 % of the patients treated without stockings (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). In conclusion, management of patients with <b>foot</b> <b>pumps</b> without GCS does not reduce the efficacy of DVT prophylaxis after THR and TKR and improves patient compliance...|$|R

50|$|A Gamow bag (pronounced Gam-Off) is an {{inflatable}} pressure bag {{large enough to}} accommodate a person inside. A patient can be placed inside the bag which is sealed and inflated with a <b>foot</b> <b>pump.</b> Within minutes, the effective altitude can be decreased by 1000 to as much as 3000 meters (3281 to 9743 feet) depending on the elevation. The bag is pressurized to 105-220 mm, pressure gradient is regulated by pop-off valves set to the target pressure. It is primarily used for treating severe cases of altitude sickness, high-altitude cerebral edema, and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Like office-based hyperbaric medicine, the Gamow bag uses increased partial pressure of oxygen for therapy of hypobaric injury, but it has the advantage of being portable for field use. Patients typically are treated in 1-hour increments and then are reevaluated.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This {{pilot study}} aimed to {{establish}} if an exercise programme utilizing the world’s first manual compression foot-pump, {{commonly known as}} “Venous Anti-Stasis Slippers”, {{could be used as}} an intervention to improve dialysis efficacy (Kt/V) and the quality of life (QOL) of patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD). The entire population of 34 self-care renal patients at the Flora Clinic renal unit were screened and 19 patients who met the inclusion criteria for the study were invited to participate in this 16 week pilot study. Baseline dialysis efficacy values were obtained from the analysis of routine blood tests and quality of life values were established {{with the use of the}} South African English version of the EQ- 5 D health questionnaire. This was followed by an eight week non-intervention period. Pre-intervention values were then established prior to the implementation of an eight week exercise programme using the manual compression <b>foot</b> <b>pumps.</b> A single group time series design was used and 12 of the initial 19 subjects completed the study by performing seated calf raising exercises, with manual compression <b>foot</b> <b>pumps</b> on their <b>feet,</b> for 20 minutes per hour during the first three hours of their routine dialysis sessions (2 - 3 times per week) over a period of eight weeks. Exercise diaries were kept to record exercise times, heart rates and exercise intensities. At the end of the eight week exercise programme, dialysis efficacy and quality of life values were re-measured. An intention to treat analysis of routine blood test results revealed statistically significant changes in dialysis efficacy (Kt/V) values between baseline (1. 70 ± 0. 48), pre-intervention (1. 39 ± 0. 43) and post intervention (1. 50 ± 0. 47) with a resultant 7. 91...|$|R

40|$|We {{conducted}} a randomized clinical trial {{to compare the}} effectiveness of the A-V Impulse System <b>foot</b> <b>pump</b> for reducing the incidence of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in patients under edoxaban thromboprophylaxis. Patients undergoing primary TKA at our institution between September 2013 and March 2015 were enrolled after obtaining informed consent. The patients were randomized to use the <b>foot</b> <b>pump</b> (n = 58) and not to use the <b>foot</b> <b>pump</b> (n = 62). Both groups were given prophylactic edoxaban. Primary outcomes were any DVT as detected by bilateral ultrasonography up to postoperative day 10 (POD 10) and pulmonary embolism (PE) up to POD 28. The safety outcomes were bleeding and death of any cause up to POD 28. Plasma D-dimer levels were measured before TKA and on POD 10 after TKA. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) -class anti-PF 4 /heparin antibodies were measured using an IgG-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The incidences of any DVT up to POD 28 were 31. 0 % and 17. 7 % in patients with or without the <b>foot</b> <b>pump,</b> respectively. The incidences of major bleeding up to POD 28 were 5. 1 % and 4. 8 % in patients with or without the <b>foot</b> <b>pump,</b> respectively. <b>Foot</b> <b>pump</b> use did not significantly reduce the incidence of DVTs in patients undergoing TKA under edoxaban thromboprophylaxis. Although seroconversion of anti-PF 4 /heparin antibodies was confirmed in one-fourth of patients, the seroconversion rates did not differ between patients with (20. 7 %) or without (25. 8 %) <b>foot</b> <b>pump</b> use. This study shows that the A-V Impulse system <b>foot</b> <b>pump</b> did not affect the incidence of DVT under edoxaban thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing TKA. Seroconversion of anti-PF 4 /heparin antibodies was detected in a significant number of patients who underwent TKA under antithrombotic prophylaxis using edoxaban. 長崎大学学位論文 学位記番号:博(医歯薬) 甲第 986 号 学位授与年月日:平成 29 年 9 月 20 日Author: Sakai, Tatsuya; Izumi, Masahiro; Kumagai, Kenji; Kidera, Kenichi; Yamaguchi, Takayuki; Asahara, Tomohiko; Kozuru, Hideko; Jiuchi, Yuka; Mawatari, Masaaki; Osaki, Makoto; Motokawa, Satoru; Migita, KiyoshiCitation: Medicine, 95 (1), e 2247; 201...|$|E

50|$|Pumps in this {{category}} range from simplex, with one cylinder, to in some cases quad (four) cylinders, or more. Many reciprocating-type pumps are duplex (two) or triplex (three) cylinder. They can be either single-acting with suction during one direction of piston motion and discharge on the other, or double-acting with suction and discharge in both directions. The pumps can be powered manually, by air or steam, or by a belt driven by an engine. This type of pump was used extensively in the 19th century—in {{the early days of}} steam propulsion—as boiler feed water pumps. Now reciprocating pumps typically pump highly viscous fluids like concrete and heavy oils, and serve in special applications that demand low flow rates against high resistance. Reciprocating hand pumps were widely used to pump water from wells. Common bicycle <b>pumps</b> and <b>foot</b> <b>pumps</b> for inflation use reciprocating action.|$|R
