50|$|The wing may be {{a single}} or <b>double</b> <b>skin</b> unit. A single skin wing uses the same {{material}} for structure and holding the air, while a <b>double</b> <b>skin</b> arrangement uses an airtight bladder in a structural casing of strong but porous textile. Single skin construction is simpler, and usually uses RF welding to make the seams. These bladders are usually lighter and dry out more quickly than <b>double</b> <b>skin</b> wings, but if the bladder is punctured, a new bladder is relatively easily fitted to a <b>double</b> <b>skin</b> wing, while repair of the single skin bladder may not be practicable, depending on material and construction details. Single skin wings are also easier to decontaminate, particularly if the outer surface is smooth.Single skin wings may use a bellows fold gusset to increase inflatable volume while retaining a relatively compact outline. This can reduce drag while swimming when the bladder is deflated.|$|R

40|$|<b>Double</b> <b>skin</b> facades {{are defined}} as two layers of facade {{separated}} by an air gap, that varies in its depth creating a solar chimney effect where warm air rises by buoyancy. As a facade technology, its thermal and daylight performance is still under scientific scrutiny. The bulk {{of research on the}} performance of this facade configuration is carried out in moderate climates. However, little is understood about the performance of <b>double</b> <b>skin</b> facade configurations in extreme hot arid climates. This investigation adopts an analytical approach using a dynamic simulation software (IESVE), to convert general intuitions on the performance of a <b>double</b> <b>skin</b> facade, in hot arid areas, into the grounds of understanding its performance based on research. It is an opportunity to study this facade configuration before the technology is transferred into construction in hot arid areas. In this paper, a comparative analysis of cooling loads on a single skin base case is compared against three possible changes to the physical properties of the external layer of the <b>double</b> <b>skin</b> facade. A dynamic thermal performance software APACHE-Sim is used (integrated environmental solutions IESVE, version 5. 1).

A Guernsey designed carbon fibre double and quad appeared in 2008. This design went into production in the UK in 2009, with a fleet being built for the 2009 world championships in Plymouth. Boat building in Jersey ceased in the '80's. All Channel Island boats are now built to FISA dimensions.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the high-performance coatings, a secondary layer of perforated aluminum louvers is hung from the glass to create a <b>double</b> <b>skinned</b> façade. The interstitial cavity created by these two layers creates a convective stack-effect, drawing cool air in through {{the underside of the}} building and hot air out {{at the top of the}} structure near the roof. The perforated louvers provide extensive primary sun protection in closed condition. They reduce up to 70% of solar heat gain at its peak load, yet still provide 15% of light transmittance through the perforations.Given the intensity of the tropical sunlight, field measurements have calculated that this 15% light transmittance in closed mode is sufficient natural lighting to perform routine office functions without the need for secondary artificial lighting in most (75%) of spaces.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{advantage}} and shortcoming of anisotropic material of thermal conductivity using as building envelope were analyzed in this paper. The thermal performance of anisotropic material of thermal conductivity was presented by ro-tating the original rectangular axes {{so as to}} determine the principal axes and make the cross-derivative terms disappear. The {{results indicated that the}} heat flux vector is commonly not perpendicular to the isothermal surface in anisotropic ma-terial. <b>Double</b> <b>skin</b> facade has been successfully applied in many building designs. The application of laminated composite with anisotropic thermal conductivity in <b>double</b> <b>skin</b> envelope was proposed to avoid its disadvantage. The interior enve-lope in <b>double</b> <b>skin</b> system may be made of laminated glaze or other laminated materials. Basing on the combination of anisotropic material and <b>double</b> <b>skin</b> envelope, the indoor cooling and heating load decrease in summer and winter respec-tively while the anisotropic material was used as interior building envelope. Especially in summer, the effect of energy saving is obvious since the partial magnitude of conductive heat in the interior envelope could be brought out from the cavity by natural ventilation through it...|$|R

50|$|Vegetable {{garden bed}} {{construction}} materials should be chosen carefully. Some concerns exist {{regarding the use}} of pressure-treated timber. Pine that was treated using chromated copper arsenate or CCA, a toxic chemical mix for preserving timber that may leach chemicals into the soil which in turn can be drawn up into the plants, is a concern for vegetable growers, where part or all of the plant is eaten. If using timber to raise the garden bed, ensure that it is an untreated hardwood to prevent the risk of chemicals leaching into the soil. A common approach is to use timber sleepers joined with steel rods to hold them together. Another approach is to use concrete blocks, although less aesthetically pleasing, they are inexpensive to source and easy to use. On the market are also prefab raised garden bed solutions which are made from long lasting polyethylene that is UV stabilized and food grade so it will not leach undesirable chemicals into the soil or deteriorate in the elements. A <b>double</b> <b>skinned</b> wall provides an air pocket of insulation that minimizes the temperature fluctuations and drying out of the soil in the garden bed. Sometimes raised bed gardens are covered with clear plastic to protect the crops from wind and strong rains. Pre-manufactured raised bed gardening boxes also exist.
