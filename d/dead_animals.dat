5|$|The {{azure-hooded jay}} is omnivorous, eating berries, seeds, and small, <b>dead</b> <b>animals.</b> This species {{has been known}} to steal and eat bait from traps set for small mammals. The bird tends to forage in the forest canopy.|$|E
5|$|Current {{research}} suggests that the primary method of infection in animals is through ingestion. It is thought that prions may be deposited in the environment through the remains of <b>dead</b> <b>animals</b> and via urine, saliva, and other body fluids. They may then linger in the soil by binding to clay and other minerals.|$|E
5|$|For Jains, lacto-vegetarianism (generally known {{simply as}} vegetarianism in India) is mandatory. Food which {{contains}} even small particles of the bodies of <b>dead</b> <b>animals</b> or eggs is absolutely unacceptable. Some Jain scholars and activists support veganism, as the production of dairy products is perceived to involve violence against cows.|$|E

5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture forages {{using its}} keen {{eyesight}} to locate carrion on the ground, but also uses {{its sense of}} smell, an ability which is uncommon in the avian world. It locates carrion by detecting the scent of ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in <b>dead</b> <b>animals.</b>|$|E
5|$|The jays {{travel in}} groups of two to ten {{individuals}} and may join mixed-species flocks. It is a secretive species and therefore difficult to observe in the wild. As an omnivore, this jay eats berries, seeds, and small, <b>dead</b> <b>animals.</b> Females lay three to four eggs, and the young fledge after twenty days. This species is listed as Least Concern, meaning it is not threatened with extinction.|$|E
5|$|The {{lesser yellow-headed vulture}} forages {{using its}} keen {{eyesight}} to locate carrion on the ground, but also uses its sense of smell, an ability which is uncommon in the avian world.

50|$|Scavenging {{is both a}} {{carnivorous}} and a herbivorous {{feeding behavior}} in which the scavenger feeds on <b>dead</b> <b>animal</b> and plant material present in its habitat. The eating of carrion from the same species {{is referred to as}} cannibalism. Scavengers {{play an important role in}} the ecosystem by consuming the <b>dead</b> <b>animal</b> and plant material. Decomposers and detritivores complete this process, by consuming the remains left by scavengers.|$|R

50|$|Necrophages, are olophages that obtain {{nutrients}} by consuming decomposing <b>dead</b> <b>animal</b> biomass. The term {{derives from}} Greek nekros, meaning 'dead', and phagein, meaning 'to eat'.|$|R
5|$|C. c. coronoides, the {{nominate}} or eastern subspecies, {{is found}} across most of eastern Australia. Its range is also {{highly correlated with}} the presence of sheep. This is thought to be because of the frequency of <b>dead</b> <b>animals,</b> which can be an important source of food. Ornithologist Ian Rowley held that the eastern subspecies was expanding eastwards before European colonisation, and that this suggested it was of younger origin than the western subspecies, which appears static. The advent of agriculture facilitated further spread.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens {{have been}} {{observed}} calling wolves {{to the site of}} <b>dead</b> <b>animals.</b> The wolves open the carcass, leaving the scraps more accessible to the birds. They watch where other common ravens bury their food and remember the locations of each other's food caches, so they can steal from them. This type of theft occurs so regularly that common ravens will fly extra distances from a food source to find better hiding places for food. They have also been observed pretending to make a cache without actually depositing the food, presumably to confuse onlookers.|$|E
5|$|Insect ecology is the {{scientific}} study of how insects, individually or as a community, interact with the surrounding environment or ecosystem. Insects play {{one of the most important}} roles in their ecosystems, which includes many roles, such as soil turning and aeration, dung burial, pest control, pollination and wildlife nutrition. An example is the beetles, which are scavengers that feed on <b>dead</b> <b>animals</b> and fallen trees and thereby recycle biological materials into forms found useful by other organisms. These insects, and others, are responsible for much of the process by which topsoil is created.|$|E

These are common properties of Solnhofen fossils, because the <b>dead</b> <b>animals</b> would fall onto hardened surfaces, which would form a natural plane for the future slabs to split along and would leave {{the bulk of the}} fossil on one side and little on the other.|$|E
5|$|Decaying {{organic matter}} {{is a primary}} diet for many species. This can range from dung, which is {{consumed}} by coprophagous species (such as certain scarab beetles in the Scarabaeidae), to <b>dead</b> <b>animals,</b> which are eaten by necrophagous species (such as the carrion beetles, Silphidae). Some beetles found in dung and carrion are in fact predatory. These include members of the Histeridae and Silphidae, preying on the larvae of coprophagous and necrophagous insects. Many beetles feed under bark, some feed on wood while others feed on fungi growing on wood or leaf-litter. Some beetles have special mycangia, structures for the transport of fungal spores.|$|E
5|$|In Italy, {{the number}} of {{breeding}} pairs declined from 30 in 1970 to 9 in the 1990s. Nearly all breeding failures were due to human activities. In Spain, which holds about 50% of the European population suggested causes of decline include poisoning by accumulation of lead, pesticides (especially due to large-scale use in the control of Schistocerca gregaria locust swarms), and electrocution. Windfarms may also pose a threat. Poorly designed power transmission lines in east Africa electrocute many wintering vultures. A shortage of carrion resulting from new rules for disposal of <b>dead</b> <b>animals</b> following the outbreak of Bovine Spongiform Encephalitis in parts of Europe during 2000 may have also {{had an effect on}} some populations. In Armenia direct persecution for trophy and for local illegal trade of animal as pet has been recorded.|$|E

5|$|Sebring Farms {{was reduced}} to piles of rubber, with four tall royal palm trees left standing. Only six people in the town survived. The hotel at Miami Locks (today known as Lake Harbor) was the sole {{structure}} to survive the storm. The bodies of many <b>dead</b> <b>animals</b> were resting on the canal banks. Ninety-nine people died in that town. In Chosen, only two people managed to escape a house that sheltered nineteen people. At Henry Martin's store, the building lost its roof during the storm, forcing the occupants {{to move into the}} restroom. A house that was full of people floated about half a mile (0.8km) from its original location. The occupants were unaware that the house was moving until it collided with a railroad embankment. Twenty three people died in Chosen.|$|E
5|$|Since 2008, the zoo {{has been}} {{lobbying}} for {{a permit to}} build an eagle sanctuary {{in order to be}} able to distribute the animals' feathers to tribal members for ceremonial purposes in accordance with federal law. Since the species are listed as endangered, any remains of <b>dead</b> <b>animals</b> are confiscated by the federal government and transported to a central repository in Colorado; members of Native American Indian nations then have to apply individually to receive parts, such as feathers, in a lengthy process with wait-times that can exceed several years. Since a tribally operated eagle sanctuary constitutes an exception to the process, it would be instrumental in strengthening Navajo cultural sovereignty; currently, only the Iowa and Zuni nations operate eagle sanctuaries for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|The diet {{of coconut}} crabs {{consists}} primarily of fleshy fruits (particularly Ochrosia ackeringae, Arenga listeri, Pandanus elatus, P. christmatensis); nuts (Aleurites moluccanus), drupes (Cocos nucifera) and seeds (Annona reticulata); and the pith of fallen trees. However, {{as they are}} omnivores, they will consume other organic materials such as tortoise hatchlings and <b>dead</b> <b>animals.</b> They have been observed to prey upon crabs like Gecarcoidea natalis and Discoplax hirtipes, as well as scavenge on the carcasses of other coconut crabs. During a tagging experiment, one coconut crab was observed killing and eating a Polynesian Rat (Rattus exulans). In 2016, a large coconut crab was observed climbing a tree in order to disable and consume a red-footed booby on the Chagos Archipelago.|$|E

5|$|The {{turkey vulture}} is a {{scavenger}} and feeds {{almost exclusively on}} carrion. It finds its food using its keen eyes and sense of smell, flying low enough to detect the gases produced by {{the beginnings of the}} process of decay in <b>dead</b> <b>animals.</b> In flight, it uses thermals to move through the air, flapping its wings infrequently. It roosts in large community groups. Lacking a syrinx—the vocal organ of birds—its only vocalizations are grunts or low hisses. It nests in caves, hollow trees, or thickets. Each year it generally raises two chicks, which it feeds by regurgitation. It has very few natural predators. In the United States, the vulture receives legal protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.|$|E
5|$|A {{detailed}} re-assessment of the taphonomy by palaeontologist Martin Sander of the University of Bonn, Germany, {{found that}} the mud-miring hypothesis first suggested by Fraas is true: animals above a certain body weight sank into the mud, which was further liquefied by their attempts to free themselves. Sander's scenario, similar to that proposed for the famous Rancho La Brea Tar Pits, {{is the only one}} explaining all taphonomic data. The degree of completeness of the carcasses was not influenced by transport, which is obvious from the lack of indications for transport before burial, but rather by how much the <b>dead</b> <b>animals</b> were scavenged. Juveniles of Plateosaurus and other taxa of herbivores were too light to sink into the mud or managed to extract themselves, and were thus not preserved. Similarly, scavenging theropods were not trapped due to their lower body weights, combined with proportionally larger feet. There is no indication of herding, or of catastrophic burial of such a herd, or catastrophic accumulation of animals that previously died isolated elsewhere.|$|E
