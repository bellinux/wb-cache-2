5|$|A similar {{cladogram}} {{was published}} in 2007, inverting the placement of Goura and Dicunculus and including the pheasant pigeon (Otidiphaps nobilis) and the thick-billed ground pigeon (Trugon terrestris) {{at the base of}} the clade. Based on behavioural and morphological evidence, Jolyon C. Parish proposed that the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire should be placed in the Gourinae subfamily along with the Groura pigeons and others, in agreement with the genetic evidence. In 2014, DNA of the only known specimen of the recently extinct spotted green pigeon (Caloenas maculata) was analysed, and it was <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> close relative of the Nicobar pigeon, and thus also the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire.|$|E
5|$|Gravitationally induced {{irregularities}} in Uranus's observed orbit led eventually {{to the discovery}} of Neptune in 1846, and presumed {{irregularities in}} Neptune's orbit subsequently led to a search which did not find the perturbing object (it was later <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> mathematical artefact caused by an overestimation of Neptune's mass) but did find Pluto in 1930. Initially believed to be roughly the mass of the Earth, observation gradually shrank Pluto's estimated mass until it was revealed to be a mere five hundredth as large; far too small to have influenced Neptune's orbit at all. In 1989, Voyager 2 determined the irregularities to be due to an overestimation of Neptune's mass.|$|E
5|$|In November 1888, he {{lost his}} post at the school for reasons that remain unclear. One month later his body was {{discovered}} drowned in the River Thames. His death, which was <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> suicide, roughly coincided {{with the end of}} the murders attributed to Jack the Ripper. Private suggestions in the 1890s that he could have committed the crimes became public knowledge in the 1960s, and led to the publication of books that proposed him as the murderer. The evidence against him was entirely circumstantial, however, and many writers from the 1970s onwards have rejected him as a likely suspect.|$|E

5|$|In {{identifying}} the remains {{as those of}} Palaeoscincus, Broom initially classified Paranthodon as an ankylosaurian, a statement backed {{by the research of}} Coombs in the 1970s. However, in 1929, Nopcsa identified the taxon as a stegosaurid, with which most modern studies agree. In 1981, the genus was reviewed with modern taxonomy, and <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> valid genus of stegosaurid. However, a more recent 2008 review of Stegosauria could only identify one distinguishing feature, and while that study still referred it to Stegosauridae based on similarity, no diagnostic features of the family could be identified in Paranthodon.|$|E

5|$|Other {{propulsion}} problems included excessive motor vibrations {{at certain}} speeds which damaged various components (which {{was attributed to}} the removal of a flywheel and to corrosion caused by the fuel problems), and excessive fuel consumption in Collins at high speed (found {{to be caused by}} manufacturing problems with the turbines and turbochargers). The propulsion system was also <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> secondary source of noise: poor design of the exhaust mufflers, weight-saving measures in the generator mountings, and an incorrect voltage supply to the battery compartment exhaust fans were noise-creating factors found and eliminated during studies by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} fly or glide has been {{suggested}} {{for at least five}} dromaeosaurid species. The first, Rahonavis ostromi (originally classified as avian bird, but <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> dromaeosaurid in later studies) may have been capable of powered flight, as indicated by its long forelimbs with evidence of quill knob attachments for long sturdy flight feathers. The forelimbs of Rahonavis were more powerfully built than Archaeopteryx, and show evidence that they bore strong ligament attachments necessary for flapping flight. Luis Chiappe concluded that, given these adaptations, Rahonavis could probably fly but would have been more clumsy in the air than modern birds.|$|E
