The {{objective of this}} study was to attempt to calibrate the parameters of wheat phenology coefficients, including cultivar and ecotype coefficients, and develop the winter wheat phenology coefficients of Beijing area. To achieve this goal, field surveys of 7 years in wheat growing seasons in Beijing were carried out during 2005 – 2012. The trail-and-error method and GLUE method were used to calibrate the phenology parameters with 4 growing seasons of 05 / 06, 06 / 07, 07 / 08 and 08 / 09. Three growing seasons, 09 / 10, 10 / 11, and 11 / 12 were used for validation, and the results showed good agreements between observed date and predicted <b>date.</b> The RMSE <b>of</b> <b>validation</b> data for TS, BT, HD, AN, and MA were 1. 63 d, 2. 45 d, 3. 16 d, 1. 83 d, 3. 56 d, respectively.

When users open a document, the structure of its file format is scanned {{to ensure that it}} conforms with specifications defined by XML schema; if a file fails the validation process it will, by default, be opened in Protected View, a new read-only, isolated sandbox environment to protect users from potentially malicious content. this design allows users to visually assess potentially unsafe documents that fail validation. Microsoft has stated that it is possible for documents to fail validation as a false positive. To improve Office File Validation, Office 2010 collects various information about files that have failed validation and also creates copies of these files for optional submission to Microsoft through Windows Error Reporting. Users are prompted approximately every two weeks from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> a failed <b>validation</b> attempt to submit copies of files or other information for analysis; prompts include a list of files that will be submitted to Microsoft and require explicit user consent prior to data submission.

Specifically, we validate a FEM of a rat tibia, including trabecular network geometry, using a material testing stage housed within a microCT scanner. We further apply novel landmark based morphometric approaches to more effectively compare modelled and experimental results. 542 landmark points on the cortical and trabecular bone surfaces of the model were selected and validated in 3 D against experimental data.

In this paper we describe the process <b>of</b> collecting <b>validation</b> data and the outcomes <b>of</b> the process. <b>Validation</b> data were obtained from two sources: employers' records and government benefit data from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). The former provided information on occupation and employment status, gross and net pay, membership of company pension schemes and industry sector. The latter provided histories of benefit receipt and tax credits, for example, child, disability, housing and unemployment benefits, pensions and income support. In the survey interview, respondents were asked for written permission both to obtain their DWP records and to contact their employer. They {{were also asked to}} provide information that would facilitate the process <b>of</b> obtaining the <b>validation</b> data: National Insurance number (NINO) and employer contact details. Subsequently, DWP records were extracted using a non-hierarchical matching strategy, based on different combinations of identifying variables obtained in the survey (NINO, sex, <b>date</b> <b>of</b> birth, name and postcode), and a survey of employers was carried out (mail, with telephone follow-up). The representativeness <b>of</b> the <b>validation</b> samples obtained depends on the co-operation of both survey respondents and providers <b>of</b> <b>validation</b> data, as well as errors in the matching process. We report permission rates, proportions providing matching items, match rates for the DWP data and response rates to the employer survey. We identify correlates of these measures of success at each stage <b>of</b> the <b>validation</b> process in terms of substantive characteristics of the survey respondents. Variation by subgroups is identified and implications for the representativeness <b>of</b> the <b>validation</b> sample are discussed. ...|$|R

Models are valuable tools to assess their effectiveness. Watershed managers need to choose appropriate and effective modelling methods for a given set of conditions. This paper considered state-of-the-art modelling strategies for the assessment of agricultural BMPs. Typical watershed models and specific models were analyzed in detail. Further improvements, including simplified tools, model integration, and incorporation of climate change and uncertainty analysis were also explored. This paper indicated that modelling methods are strictly scale dependent, both spatially and temporally. Despite current achievements, there is still room for future research, such as broadening the range of the pollutants considered, introducing more local BMPs, improving the representation of the functionality of BMPs, and gathering monitoring <b>date</b> for <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> modelled results. There is also a trend towards agricultural decision support systems (DSSs) for assessing agricultural BMPs, in which models of different scales are seamlessly integrated to bridge the scale and data gaps.

The process is developed {{in such a}} way that the required parameters are achieved and it ensures that the output of the process will consistently meet the required parameters during routine production, the process is validated. The process validation process parameters are derived from the specifications for the device, component or other entity to be produced by the process. A manufacturer can assure through careful design of the device, processes, process controls and packaging that all manufactured units will meet specifications and have uniform quality. However, in-process and finished product testing still play an important role in assuring that products meet specifications Validation is defined as a collection and evaluation of data, from the process design stage through commercial production, which establishes scientific evidence that a process is capable of consistently delivering quality product. The validation protocol includes inventory control and equipment inspection in the preliminary steps and in-process controls in the subsequent steps. Process controls are mandatory in good manufacturing practices (GMP). The goal of a quality system is to consistently produce products that are fit for their intended use.
