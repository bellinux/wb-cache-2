5|$|Preload {{refers to}} the filling {{pressure}} of the atria {{at the end of}} diastole, when they are at their fullest. A main factor <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it takes the ventricles to fill—if the ventricles contract faster, then there is less time to fill and the preload will be less. Preload can also be affected by a person's blood volume. The force of each contraction of the heart muscle is proportional to the preload, described as the Frank-Starling mechanism. This states that the force of contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of muscle fiber, meaning a ventricle will contract more forcefully, the more it is stretched.|$|E
25|$|Seven {{criteria}} {{measure the}} usability {{of different types}} of public transport and its overall appeal, although they overlap somewhat. The criteria are speed, comfort, safety, cost, proximity, timeliness and directness. Speed is calculated from total journey time including transfers. Proximity means how far passengers must walk or otherwise travel before they can begin the public transport leg of their journey and how close it leaves them to their desired destination. Timeliness <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> they must wait for the vehicle. Directness records how far a journey using public transport deviates from the shortest route.|$|E

2500|$|Although some {{solutions}} attribute {{a crucial}} role to the acceleration of the travelling twin {{at the time of}} the turnaround, others note that the effect also arises if one imagines separate outward-going and inward-coming travellers, who pass each other and synchronize their clocks at the point corresponding to [...] "turnaround" [...] of a single traveller. In this version, physical acceleration of the travelling clock plays no direct role; [...] "the issue <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> the world-lines are, not how bent". The length referred to here is the Lorentz-invariant length or [...] "proper time interval" [...] of a trajectory which corresponds to the elapsed time measured by a clock following that trajectory (see Section Difference in elapsed time as a result of differences in twins' spacetime paths below). In Minkowski spacetime, the travelling twin must feel a different history of accelerations from the earthbound twin, even if this just means accelerations of the same size separated by different amounts of time, however [...] "even this role for acceleration can be eliminated in formulations of the twin paradox in curved spacetime, where the twins can fall freely along space-time geodesics between meetings".|$|E
2500|$|Early in his reign, Antipas {{had married}} the {{daughter}} of King Aretas IV of Nabatea. However, {{on a visit to}} Rome he stayed with his half-brother Herod II and there fell in love with his wife, Herodias, (granddaughter of Herod the Great and Mariamne I), and the two agreed to marry, after Herod Antipas had divorced his wife. Aretas' daughter learned of the plan and asked permission to travel to the frontier fortress of Machaerus, whence Nabatean forces escorted her to her father. With his daughter now safe in his custody, Aretas now could declare war on Herod. It is generally agreed that the war, in which Herod was defeated, occurred in 36, a year before the death of the emperor Tiberius. A point of contention today <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> before this date Herod's marriage to Herodias took place. Some surmise that the marriage of Antipas and Herodias took place shortly before the war in about the year 34, after the death of Philip, but others have pointed to Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews Book 18, chapter 5, paragraph 4 comment that Herodias [...] "divorced herself from her husband while he was alive" [...] to argue that it took place before Herod II's death, in about the year 27, thus making it possible for Jesus to have been born in the reign of Herod the Great (as indicated by the Gospel of Matthew) and to have died in his early 30's (as indicated by the Gospel of Luke).|$|E

6000|$|... "Fetish" [...] is, perhaps, rather {{too strong}} a word, but I should not mind saying that informality was the tutelary genius of the place. American men are {{everywhere}} impatient of form. It burdens and bothers them, and they like to throw it off whenever they can. We {{may not be so}} very democratic at heart as we seem, but we are impatient of ceremonies that separate us when it is our business or our pleasure to get at one another; and it is part of our splendor to ignore the ceremonies, as we do the expenses. We have all the decent grades of riches and poverty in our colony, but our informality is not more the treasure of the humble than of the great. In the nature of things it cannot last, however, and the only question <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it will last. I think, myself, until some one imagines giving an eight-o'clock dinner; then all the informalities will go, and the whole train of evils which such a dinner connotes will rush in.|$|E
