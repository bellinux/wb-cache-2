5000|$|From Mr Tom PocockSir:Frank Bower was {{not always}} able to eject {{unwanted}} patrons from El Vino (Letters, 1 May). One morning in the late Fifties, a West Indian workman entered {{what he thought was}} a pub and asked the proprietor for a pint of bitter. Empurpled with rage, embroidered waistcoat at bursting point, Bower was hustling him into Fleet Street when interrupted by a crisp military command from the back of the bar: `That gentleman is a friend of mine. I have been expecting him. Kindly show him to my table.' Colonel Wintle - celebrated for inspecting the turn out of his German guards when a prisoner of war and for <b>debagging</b> a solicitor - had spoken.Rising to greet his guest, Wintle trained his monocle on Bower and ordered, `Pray bring us two small glasses of white wine.' When this had been drunk and a convivial conversation concluded, the Colonel and his new friend rose, shook hands and went their separate ways.Tom Pocock22 Lawrence Street, London SW3 ...|$|E
5000|$|Randolph {{reported}} from the German elections in July 1932; his son Winston later {{claimed that he}} was the first British journalist to warn about Hitler. Randolph also became embroiled in the controversy of the February 1933 King and Country debate at the Oxford Union Society. Three weeks after the Union had passed a pacifist motion, Randolph and his friend Lord Stanley proposed a resolution to delete the previous motion from the Union's records. After a poor speech from Stanley, the President Frank Hardie temporarily handed over the chair to the Librarian and opposed the motion on behalf of the Union, a very unusual move. The minutes record that he received [...] "a very remarkable ovation". Randolph was then met by a barrage of hisses and stink bombs. His speech, facing what the minutes describe as a [...] "very antipathetic and even angry house" [...] was [...] "unfortunate in his manner and phrasing" [...] and was met with [...] "delighted jeers". He then attempted to withdraw the motion. Hardie was willing to permit this, but an ex-President pointed out from the floor that a vote of the whole house was required to allow a motion to be withdrawn. The request to withdraw was defeated by acclamation and the motion was then defeated by 750 votes to 138 (a far better attendance than the original debate had attained). Randolph had persuaded a number of other former students, life members of the Union, to attend in the hope of carrying his motion. A bodyguard of Oxford Conservatives and police escorted Churchill back to his hotel after the debate. Sir Edward Heath recorded in his memoirs that after the debate some of the undergraduates had been intent on <b>debagging</b> him. Winston Churchill wrote praising his son's courage in addressing a large, hostile audience, adding that [...] "he was by no means cowed".|$|E
40|$|AbstractAppearance {{quality is}} the main element forming the fruit quality. Both bagging and {{reflective}} film application can improve appearance comprehensive quality. In {{order to determine the}} effects of bagging and reflective film on peach fruit coloration, this study explored the effects of applying reflective film before harvest on fruit appearance quality of peach (Prunus persica), and discussed the influencing mechanism on fruit coloration. Yellow outside and black inside double-layer bags were removed from fruit twelve days d before harvest. Peel color, pigment content, enzyme activity as well as the gene expression related to fruit coloration of a well-colored and late-ripening peach cultivar ‘Xiahui 8 ’ with different treatments (non-bagging with non-reflective film mulching, <b>debagging</b> with non-reflective film mulching, <b>debagging</b> with reflective film mulching) were researched. The results showed that both <b>debagging</b> with non-reflective film mulching and <b>debagging</b> with reflective film mulching could significantly improve red and green color difference value (a*), a*/b* (b* is yellow and blue color difference value), chroma (C), anthocyanin (Ant) content and reduce hue angle (h), while <b>debagging</b> with reflective film mulching had higher Ant content than <b>debagging</b> with non-reflective film mulching (P < 0. 05). The two treatments up-regulated the transcript level of anthocyanin biosynthetic related genes (UFGT, CHS) at the beginning of the experiment, however, the expression of DFR, LDOX and F 3 H were enhanced along with the testing process. A downward trend on peel phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) activity of non-bagging with non-reflective film mulching was observed during the experiment, however, the peel PAL activity of the other two treatments first increased and then decreased. What’s more, peel PAL activity of <b>debagging</b> with reflective film mulching was higher than <b>debagging</b> with non-reflective film mulching. These results suggested that Ant synthesis in the peel was the result of cooperation among several genes, and <b>debagging</b> with reflective film mulching had better effect on promoting Ant accumulation than <b>debagging</b> with non-reflective film mulching...|$|E
40|$|Bagged {{fruits of}} green apple {{cultivar}} ‘Granny Smith’ {{have been found}} to turn cardinal red after <b>debagging</b> during fruit-ripening in the Loess Plateau region of China. To understand such phenomenon at post-transcriptional level, we have investigated the roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in response to <b>debagging.</b> Three small RNA libraries were primarily constructed from peels of ‘Granny Smith’ apples subjected to bagging followed by sunlight re-exposure treatments (0 h, 6 h, 1 d) (<b>debagging),</b> and from peels of apples without any bagging treatments (0 h, 6 h, 1 d). 201 known miRNAs belonging to 43 miRNA families and 220 novel miRNAs were identified via high-throughput sequencing. Some miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed after <b>debagging,</b> which indicated that miRNAs affected anthocyanin accumulation through their target genes in mature apple. To further explore the effect of <b>debagging</b> on miRNAs regulating the expression of anthocyanin regulatory genes, four miRNAs and their target genes regulating anthocyanin accumulation, miR 156, miR 828, miR 858 and miR 5072, were compared between green cultivar ‘Granny Smith’ and red cultivar ‘Starkrimson’. Results showed that mdm-miR 828 and mdm-miR 858 regulated anthocyanin contents in both apple cultivars, while mdm-miR 156 only affected anthocyanin accumulation in ‘Granny Smith’, and miR 5072 affected anthocyanin accumulation in ‘Starkrimson’. Additional analysis of gene ontology for the differentially expressed miRNAs after <b>debagging</b> treatments and their predicted target genes showed that they were involved in photo-protective response after <b>debagging</b> from 0 h to 1 d; they might play important roles in fruit development and adaptation to high light stress...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of <b>debagging</b> time on color and flavor / taste compounds in the non-red apple cultivar 'Golden Delicious' and red cultivar 'Qinguan' at mid and late stages of fruit development. <b>Debagging</b> briefly improved the red color in both cultivars, the peel of 'Golden Delicious' presenting pale-pink hue. However, rapid anthocyanin accumulation occurred in apple peel at a specific time (after 179 days after flowering (DAF) in 'Qinguan') and was unaltered by <b>debagging</b> time in the red cultivar 'Qinguan'. Furthermore, untimely <b>debagging</b> had a detrimental effect {{on the content of}} anthocyanin. All sugars increased and organic acids decreased in apple pulp at mid to late stages of development. Bagging treatment reduced the content of most sugars and organic acids, as well as, the overall total. However, glucose and citric acid contents were higher in bagged fruit than non-bagged fruit; the maximum occurred in T 7 treatment that was no-debagging at DAF 159 / 196 ('Golden delicious' / 'Qinguan'), i. e., 24. 35 and 0. 07 mg g- 1 FW in 'Golden delicious', and 38. 86 and 0. 06 mg g- 1 FW in 'Qinguan', respectively. In a word, bagging treatment can alter the pattern of peel color development in apple fruit; however, it remains difficult to alter the timing of rapid anthocyanin accumulation as it is regulated solely by development. Moreover, bagging treatment reduced the total accumulation of sugars and organic acids, and even the over total in pulp, but increased the glucose and citric acid contents in apple pulp...|$|E
40|$|Litchi has diverse fruit color phenotypes, yet no {{research}} reflects the biochemical background of this diversity. In this study, we evaluated 12 litchi cultivars for chromatic parameters and pigments, and investigated {{the effects of}} abscisic acid, forchlorofenron (CPPU), bagging and <b>debagging</b> treatments on fruit coloration in cv. Feizixiao, an unevenly red cultivar. Six genes encoding chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI), flavanone 3 -hydroxylase (F 3 H), dihydroflavonol 4 -reductase (DFR), anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) and UDP-glucose: flavonoid 3 -O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT) were isolated from the pericarp of the fully red litchi cv. Nuomici, and their expression was analyzed in different cultivars and under the above mentioned treatments. Pericarp anthocyanin concentration varied from none to 734 mg m− 2 among the 12 litchi cultivars, which were divided into three coloration types, i. e. non-red (‘Kuixingqingpitian’, ‘Xingqiumili’, ‘Yamulong’and ‘Yongxing No. 2 ′), unevenly red (‘Feizixiao’ and ‘Sanyuehong’) and fully red (‘Meiguili’, ‘Baila’, Baitangying’ ’Guiwei’, ‘Nuomici’ and ‘Guinuo’). The fully red type cultivars had different levels of anthocyanin but with the same composition. The expression of the six genes, especially LcF 3 H, LcDFR, LcANS and LcUFGT, in the pericarp of non-red cultivars was much weaker as compared to those red cultivars. Their expression, LcDFR and LcUFGT in particular, {{was positively correlated with}} anthocyanin concentrations in the pericarp. These results suggest the late genes in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway were coordinately expressed during red coloration of litchi fruits. Low expression of these genes resulted in absence or extremely low anthocyanin accumulation in non-red cultivars. Zero-red pericarp from either immature or CPPU treated fruits appeared to be lacking in anthocyanins due to the absence of UFGT expression. Among these six genes, only the expression of UFGT was found significantly correlated with the pericarp anthocyanin concentration (r =  0. 84). These results suggest that UFGT played a predominant role in the anthocyanin accumulation in litchi as well as pericarp coloration of a given cultivar...|$|E
