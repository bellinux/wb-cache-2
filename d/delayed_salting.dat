The free amino acid content in control and SHP-supplemented sauce were 242 and 520 mM, respectively.

40|$|Dynamic {{impact to}} the water {{environment}} of deicing salt application at a major highway (motorway) interchange in the UK is quantitatively evaluated for two recent severe UK winters. The contaminant transport pathway studied allowed controls on dynamic highway runoff and storm-sewer discharge to a receiving stream and its subsequent leakage to an underlying sandstone aquifer, including possible contribution to long-term chloride increases in supply wells, to be evaluated. Logged stream electrical-conductivity (EC) to estimate chloride concentrations, stream flow, climate and motorway salt application data {{were used to assess}} salt fate. Stream loading was responsive to salt applications and climate variability influencing salt release. Chloride (via EC) was predicted to exceed the stream Environmental Quality Standard (250 mg/l) for 33 % and 18 % of the two winters. Maximum stream concentrations (3500 mg/l, 15 % sea water salinity) were ascribed to salt-induced melting and drainage of highway snowfall without dilution from, still frozen, catchment water. Salt persistance on the highway under dry-cold conditions was inferred from stream observations of <b>delayed</b> <b>salt</b> removal. Streambed and stream-loss data demonstrated chloride infiltration could occur to the underlying aquifer with mild and severe winter stream leakage estimated to account for 21 to 54 % respectively of the 70 t of increased chloride (over baseline) annually abstracted by supply wells. Deicing salt infiltration lateral to the highway alongside other urban/natural sources were inferred to contribute the shortfall. Challenges in quantifying chloride mass/fluxes (flow gauge accuracy at high flows, salt loading from other roads, weaker chloride-EC correlation at low concentrations), may be largely overcome by modest investment in enhanced data acquisition or minor approach modification. The increased understanding of deicing salt dynamic loading {{to the water}} environment obtained is relevant to improved groundwater resource management, highway salt application practice, surface-water - ecosystem management, and decision making on highway drainage to ground...|$|R

In response, church leaders ceased performing new plural marriages. In October 1889, Wilford Woodruff, President of the Church, learned that a plural marriage had been performed the previous spring in the Endowment House without his permission. After discussing the matter with the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, he ordered the building razed without <b>delay.</b> The <b>Salt</b> Lake Tribune, in its issue dated November 17, 1889, reported that the building was [...] "being demolished".

40|$|The {{salinity}} induced {{inhibition of}} seeds germination remains not clear at physiological levels. The aims {{of this study}} is to investigate the effect of salt on germination, embryo growth, superoxide anion radical (O 2 ·-) and the respiratory activity (TTC reduction) in Crithmum maritimum L. seeds. Thus the embryo growth, in situ localization of respiratory activity and superoxide anion radical (O 2 ·-) localization, were investigated. Chlorure 2, 3, 5 -triphényltétrazolium (TTC) reduction test and superoxide anion radical (O 2 ·-) localization with Nitroblue Tetrazolium Chloride (NBT) were performed in embryo isolated from seeds of the halophyte Crithmum maritimum L either sown in distilled water or in 200 mM NaCl. The key results show that germination was maximal (90 %) in distilled water, but was fully inhibited following seed exposure to NaCl. The completion of the embryo growth (ca. 2 mm length) leading to the radicle emergence took 6 d in H 2 O, but was markedly <b>delayed</b> by <b>salt.</b> NaCl reduced the elongation zone in the embryo axis, hence indicating that the cell division and/or cell elongation were disturbed by salinity.

We also formulated definitions for salt sensitivity and resistance with a short-term volume expansion and contraction protocol and additionally from data derived from studies of long-term reduced dietary salt intake. We examined the effects of augmented potassium and calcium intake and also those of sodium as the chloride or the bicarbonate salt Finally, we sought genetic markers that are associated with salt sensitivity. We found that salt sensitivity is a function of age and is more common in blacks than whites. These groups also have relatively <b>delayed</b> acute <b>salt</b> excretion compared with controls. We were unable to identify effects of gender. Haptoglobin phenotypes (HP 1 - 1) may facilitate identification of salt-sensitive individuals.

40|$|International audienceThe {{challenge}} {{of reducing the}} salt content while maintaining shelf life, stability and acceptability of the products is major for the food industry. In the present study, we implemented processing adjustments to reduce salt content while maintaining the machinability and the saltiness perception of sheeted dough: the homogeneous distribution of a layer of encapsulated salt grains on the dough during the laminating process. During sheeting, for an imposed deformation of 0. 67, the final strain remained unchanged around 0. 50 for salt reduction below 50 %, and then, increased significantly up to 0. 53 for a dough without salt. This increase is, in fine, positive regarding the rolling process since the decrease of salt content induces less shrinkage of dough downstream, which is the main feature to be controlled in the process. Moreover, the final strain was negatively correlated to the resistance to extension measured with a texture analyzer, therefore providing a method to evaluate the machinability of the dough. From these results, a salt reduction of 25 % was achieved by holding 50 % of the salt in the dough recipe to maintain the dough properties and saving 25 % as salt grains to create high-salted areas that would enhance the saltiness perception of the dough. The distributor mounted above the rollers of the mill proved {{to be able to}} distribute evenly salt grains at a calculated step of the rolling out process. An innovative method based on RX micro-tomography allowed to follow the salt dissolving and to demonstrate the capability of the coatings to <b>delay</b> the <b>salt</b> dissolving and consequently the diffusion of salt within the dough piece. Finally, a ranking test on the salted perception of different samples having either an even distribution of encapsulated salt grains, a single layer of salt grains or a homogeneous distribution of salt, demonstrated that increasing the saltiness perception in salt-reduced food product could be achieved by a technological approach...|$|R
40|$|International audienceJapanese {{knotweed}} s. l. {{are some}} of the most invasive plants in the world. Some genotypes are known to be tolerant to the saline concentrations found in salt mar- shes. Here we focus on tolerance to higher concentrations in order to assess whether the species are able to colonize and establish in highly stressful environments, or whether salt is an efficient management tool. In a first experiment, adult plants of Fallopia japonica, Fallopia 9 bohemica and Fallopia sachalinensis were grown under salt stress conditions by watering with saline concentrations of 6, 30, 120, or 300 g L- 1 for three weeks to assess the response of the plants to a spill of salt. At the two highest concentra- tions, their leaves withered and fell. There were no effects on the aboveground parts at the lowest concentrations. Belowground dry weight and number of buds were reduced from 30 and 120 g L- 1 of salt, respectively. In a second experiment, a single spraying of 120 g L- 1 of salt was applied to individuals of F. 9 bohemica and their stems were clipped to assess the response to a potential control method. 60 % of the plants regenerated. Regeneration was <b>delayed</b> by the <b>salt</b> treatment and shoot growth slowed down. This study establishes the tolerance of three Fallopia taxa to strong salt stress, with no obvious differences between taxa.

40|$|The {{surface of}} Mars is host to many regions {{displaying}} polygonal crack patterns {{that have been}} identified as potential desiccation cracks. These regions are mostly within Noachian-aged terrains and are closely associated with phyllosilicate occurrences and smectites in particular. We have built a laboratory setup that allows us to carry out desiccation experiments on Mars-analog materials in an effort to constrain the physical and chemical properties of sediments that display polygonal cracks. The setup is complemented by a pre-existing simulation chamber that enables the investigation of the spectral and photometric properties of analog materials in Mars-like conditions. The initial experiments that have been carried out show that (1) crack patterns are visible in smectite-bearing materials in varying concentrations down to similar to 10 % smectite by weight, (2) chlorides, and potentially other <b>salts,</b> <b>delay</b> the onset of cracking and may even block it from occurring entirely, and (3) the polygonal patterns, while being indicative of the presence of phyllosilicates, cannot be used to differentiate between various phyllosilicate-bearing deposits. However, their size-scale and morphology yields important information regarding their thickness and the hydrological conditions at the time of formation. Furthermore, the complementary spectral measurements for some of the analog samples shows that crack patterns may develop in materials with such low concentrations of smectites that would not be expected to be identified using remote-sensing instruments. This may explain the presence of polygonal patterns on Mars in sediments that lack spectral confirmation of phyllosilicates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} computational {{study of the}} influence of salt on the configurations, energies, and dynamics of supercoiled DNA. A potential function that includes both elastic and electrostatic energy components is employed. Specifically, the electrostatic term, with salt-dependent coefficients, is modeled after Stigter's pioneering work on the effective diameter of DNA as a function of salt concentration. Because an effective charge per unit length is used, the electrostatic formulation does not require explicit modeling of phosphates and can be used to study long DNAs at any desired resolution of charge. With explicit consideration of the electrostatic energy, an elastic bending constant corresponding to the nonelectrostatic part of the bending contribution to the persistence length is used. We show, for a series of salt concentrations ranging from 0. 005 to 1. 0 M sodium, how configurations and energies of supercoiled DNA (1000 and 3000 base pairs) change dramatically with the simulated salt environment. At high salt, the DNA adopts highly compact and bent interwound states, with the bending energy dominating over the other components, and the electrostatic energy playing a minor role in comparison to the bending and twisting terms. At low salt, the DNA supercoils are much more open and loosely interwound, and the electrostatic components are dominant. Over the range of three decades of salt examined, the electrostatic energy changes by a factor of 10. The buckling transition between the circle and figure- 8 is highly sensitive to salt concentration: this transition is <b>delayed</b> as <b>salt</b> concentration decreases, with a particularly sharp increase below 0. 1 M. For example, for a bending-to-twisting force constant ratio of A/C = 1. 5, the linking number difference (delta LK) corresponding to equal energies for the circle and figure- 8 increases from 2. 1 to 3. 25 as salt decreases from 1. 0 to 0. 005 M. We also present in detail a family of three-lobed supercoiled DNA configurations that are predicted by elasticity theory to be stable at low delta Lk. To our knowledge, such three-dimensional structures have not been previously presented in connection with DNA supercoiling. These branched forms have a higher bending energy than the corresponding interwound configurations at the same delta Lk but, especially at low salt, this bending energy difference is relatively small in comparison with the total energy, which is dominated by the electrostatic contributions. Significantly, the electrostatic energies of the three-lobed and (straight) interwound forms are comparable at each salt environment. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|R

40|$|In {{applications}} where {{resistance to}} localised corrosion is required, stainless steel alloys containing molybdenum are generally used {{thanks to their}} superior resistance to localised attack in aggressive environments. For ferritic stainless steels, vanadium additions {{have been found to}} also have a beneficial effect on the resistance to localised corrosion. In this study vanadium and molybdenum were compared directly as alloying elements in 18 % chromium ferritic stainless steel as far as their effect on increasing the resistance to localised corrosion is concerned. Pitting potentials in a neutral chloride solution were used as the criterion for qualifying resistance to localised corrosion and it was shown that vanadium gave similar or slightly higher pitting potentials at addition levels of up to 4 % (weight percent). It was subsequently found that the mechanism by which the molybdenum and the vanadium increase the resistance to localised corrosion, are not the same. The experimental data for the molybdenum containing alloys corresponded well with other work done in this field. The positive effect of molybdenum additions on the pitting resistance of these alloys could be explained through its effect in lowering the dissolution rate in the active dissolution region by enriching on the dissolving surface. The vanadium additions to these alloys were shown not to {{have an effect on the}} active dissolution kinetics. The effect of these two alloying elements on the initiation of metastable pits were examined, but no meaningful advantage for the vanadium containing alloys over the rest could be found. It is suggested that vanadium play a role in changing the dissolution kinetics of the salt film, which forms during the growth of a metastable pit. A <b>delayed</b> dissolution of <b>salt</b> film remnants would lead to a loss of the enriched pit solution, which would cause the metastable pit to repassivate.
