The detected sound waves {{are subjected to}} pattern recognition, and a manually tested sample is manually subjected to haptic testing by testing persons for classifying the manually tested sample to a softness class independent of the manually untested sample. The softness class of the manually untested sample is assigned after comparing the patterns of the manually tested sample. USE - Method for determining softness of <b>tissue</b> <b>paper</b> i. e. hygienic paper such as cosmetic towels. Can {{also be used for}} tissues, kitchen towels and toilet paper. ADVANTAGE - The softness class of the manually untested sample of the <b>tissue</b> <b>paper</b> is assigned after comparing the patterns of the manually tested sample of the <b>tissue</b> <b>paper,</b> thus determining the softness of the <b>tissue</b> <b>paper</b> in a simple and accurate manner...|$|R

500|$|Clearmountain {{was said}} to {{have been one of the}} first {{recording}} engineers to hang <b>tissue</b> <b>paper</b> over the tweeters of the NS-10 to tame the over-bright treble.

[...] Recording engineer Bob Hodas investigated the alleged sonic effects of <b>tissue</b> <b>paper.</b> He found inconsistent results with different paper, but said that <b>tissue</b> <b>paper</b> generally demonstrated an undesirable effect known as comb filtering, where the high frequencies are reflected back into the tweeter instead of being absorbed. [...] Hodas derided the tissue practice as [...] "aberrant behaviour", saying that engineers usually fear comb filtering and its associated cancellation effects. [...] He also suggested that more controllable and less random electronic filtering would be preferable. Newell et al. noted that had the speakers' grilles been used in studios, where they are routinely removed, they would have had the same effect on the treble output as the improvised <b>tissue</b> <b>paper</b> filter.|$|R

40|$|Porous and {{flexible}} actuating materials {{are important in}} the development of smart systems. We report here a facile method to prepare scalable, flexible actuating porous membranes based on a poly(ionic liquid) -modified <b>tissue</b> <b>paper.</b> The targeted membrane property profile was based on a synergy of a gradient porous structure of poly(ionic liquid) network and the flexibility of <b>tissue</b> <b>paper.</b> The gradient porous structure was built up through ammonia-triggered electrostatic complexation of a poly(ionic liquid) with poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) that were previously impregnated inside the <b>tissue</b> <b>paper.</b> As a result, these porous membranes undergo bending deformation in response to organic solvents in vapor or liquid phase and can recover their shape back in air, which was demonstrated to be able to serve as solvent sensors. Besides, they show enhanced mechanical properties due to the introduction of mechanically flexible <b>tissue</b> <b>paper</b> that allows the membranes to be designed as new responsive textiles and contractile actuators.
