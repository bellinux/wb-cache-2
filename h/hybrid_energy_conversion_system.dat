40|$|The {{growing concern}} over {{environmental}} degradation resulting from combustion {{of fossil fuels}} and fluctuating oil prices has raised awareness about alternative energy options and has encouraged many countries to provide new policies promoting renewable energy. Such variable renewable energy sources like wind and solar are environment friendly and have potential to be more widely used. Combining these renewable energy sources with back-up units to form a <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Conversion</b> <b>System</b> (HECS) can provide a more economic and reliable supply of electricity under different load demand conditions compared to single use of such systems. A major limitation {{of the wind and}} solar options is their inherent variability and dependence on weather conditions. Their power outputs are not dispatchable by system operators as conventional generation. However, {{it may be possible to}} avoid the emergency circumstances surrounding fluctuations in renewable energy production like sudden drops or surges by evaluating complementary characteristics of some renewables. Because, different alternative energy sources can complement each other to some extent, multi-source hybrid energy systems have greater potential to provide higher quality and more reliable power to customers than a system based on a single resource. This project proposes a comprehensive planning approach to tackling the issues of wind and solar integration into the power grid and develops a procedural tool that will facilitate hybrid generation. The scope of this dissertation addresses the development of optimal planning procedures for power generation from non-dispatchable wind, solar and other dispatchable facilities. Several tools have been developed with focus ranging from resource identification to optimal sizing determination and grid connection. Historical meteorological data for solar irradiance and wind speed and power transmission information have been analyzed to provide suitable hybrid locations and optimal sizing. Models for wind, solar and reserves for power system simulation studies have been developed.

40|$|Innovative solar-geothermal <b>hybrid</b> <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>systems</b> were {{developed}} for low enthalpy geothermal resources augmented with solar energy. The {{goal is to}} find cost-effective hybrid power cycles that {{take advantage of the}} potential synergies of solar thermal and geothermal resources. One aspect is to determine the hybrid configuration that yields the highest annualized electricity generation. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is estimated using equipment costing rules of thumb developed from Aspen HTFS and Aspen ICARUS software and from other sources. Detailed models for the hybrid solar-geothermal system {{were developed}} using Aspen Plus and Aspen Dynamics. Turbine flexibility relative to vapor flow rate, temperature and pressure variations was analyzed. In one scenario, a parametric steady-state study was carried out to examine the performance over the range of conditions resulting from diurnal and seasonal variations. The results of the diurnal and seasonal parametric studies were grossly weighted to approximate a typical year in Nevada, and these results led to an estimate of the annualized electricity generation. In another scenario, a dynamic model was selected from possible "greenfield" hybrid systems and used to examine the transient performance for a typical January day and a typical July day in Nevada. The dynamic model approximates the thermal inertial of the heat exchangers and the working fluids in the exchangers, solar collectors, piping and storage tanks. The dynamic model is driven with forcing functions for solar input and ambient temperature to approximate the typical winter and summer days. (cont.) In all cases, solar energy was found to come at a higher cost per kW capacity than geothermal when the cost of geothermal wells was not considered. However, including well costs had an effect of evening out the levelized cost of electricity. Model complexity increased as more solar heat was added to existing geothermal systems, which suggests that moving a higher exergy heat source down to a lower exergy heat source is difficult, especially given the transient nature of the solar resource. The models developed in this thesis demonstrate the design decisions and complex dynamic behavior inherent in this type of hybrid system. by Andrew David Greenhut. Thesis (S. M.)

30|$|Solar {{power is}} the most {{abundant}} and intensive source of renewable energy. The global installation of solar-related <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>systems</b> keeps increasing rapidly in recent years [1]. There are many ways of utilizing this energy, including photovoltaic, solar-biologics, and photoelectrochemical cells and the harvest of solar thermal energy. Among these, solar thermal systems are simple, efficient, and cost-effective. Solar thermal energy devices include Rankine cycle engines [2], solar dryers [3], solar thermoelectric generators [4], solar thermal reformers [5, 6], and solar water heaters [7]. Nanomaterials, furthermore, have many unique physical properties that make them very attractive and useful in the conversion and utilization of solar energy [8, 9]. Most of the research efforts up to date have been focused on photovoltaics and photocatalysis [10 – 16], {{and only a few}} nanomaterials have been applied in solar thermal <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>systems</b> [4, 17 – 19]. In addition, silicon nanowire has been reported as a promising functional nanomaterial in transistors [20], sensors [21], batteries [22, 23], thermoelectrics [24], photocatalysis [25], piezoelectrics [26], photoelectrochemical cells (PEC) [27], and photovoltaics [14, 28, 29] owing to its preferable optical, thermal, chemical, and mechanical properties in <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>systems</b> as well as the fact that silicon nanowire arrays are easy to synthesize [30 – 32]. Micro/nanoscale-textured silicon surface had been recognized as a potential material for solar thermal energy harvesting [33]. However, despite the well-known feature of the “black silicon” for silicon nanowires [34, 35], there is still a scarcity of reported experimental studies on silicon nanowires for solar thermal energy systems, especially on the spectral-dependent radiative properties and the corresponding solar to thermal <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> efficiency. In addition, although silicon nanowire array absorbs visible light more effectively, the trade-off effects of scattering properties at different wavelengths in the vis-near IR range of silicon nanowires have not been clearly investigated and reported. Solar irradiation in the IR range, however, poses a significant fraction of the solar thermal energy that can be utilized in practice. Therefore, in this study, we carried out experimental and theoretical analyses on the solar thermal radiation of the silicon nanowire array radiative properties. Also, to demonstrate its potential application for solar thermal systems where a selective solar spectrum would be required, we conducted solar drying experiments which involved the infrared heating of a moist porous material. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the enhancement of solar thermal energy harvest by silicon nanowire structures where the spectral optical properties including light absorption and scattering vary in the main wavelength range of solar irradiation. The intrinsic optical properties of the thin silicon plates (with or without silicon nanowires) used in these experiments block most ultraviolet and visible light while allowing a significant fraction of infrared to be transmitted, which is assumed to be absorbed directly by the moist porous material below. Based on our literature review, the investigation specifically on the trade-off spectral-dependent solar thermal behavior has not been clearly reported in scientific articles. Therefore, it is emphasized that the results of this study can be used to evaluate the overall solar <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> efficiency of silicon nanowire-based <b>hybrid</b> <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>systems</b> such as photovoltaic and solar thermal systems.|$|R

Vibration analysis also favored the selected switched reluctance generator topology for the economic and maintenance free rural electrification in standalone wind <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
40|$|Various {{advanced}} <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>systems</b> (ECS) {{are compared}} {{with each other}} and with current technology systems for their savings in fuel energy, costs, and emissions in individual plants and on a national level. About fifty industrial processes from the largest energy consuming sectors were used as a basis for matching a similar number of <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>systems</b> that are considered as candidates which can be made available by the 1985 to 2000 time period. The sectors considered included food, textiles, lumber, paper, chemicals, petroleum, glass, and primary metals. The <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>systems</b> included steam and gas turbines, diesels, thermionics, stirling, closed cycle and steam injected gas turbines, and fuel cells. Fuels considered were coal, both coal and petroleum based residual and distillate liquid fuels, and low Btu gas obtained through the on-site gasification of coal. Computer generated reports of the fuel consumption and savings, capital costs, economics and emissions of the cogeneration <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>systems</b> (ECS's) heat and power matched to the individual industrial processes are presented for coal fired process boilers. National fuel and emissions savings are also reported for each ECS assuming it alone is implemented...|$|R
