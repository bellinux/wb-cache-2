Experimental tests are executed following ASTM or UNI <b>EN</b> <b>rules,</b> in particular the shear test is executed using a rig constructed to the purpose, designed following the rule ASTM D 4255 - 83. Besides the tests were simulated by analytical methods, by means of Cadec software and numerically by FEM software as Altair Hyperworks and Ansys, to evidence the error range of the experimental test and to obtain the configuration that can give suitable results also for more complex designs. The successive phase of optimization is useful to obtain a reduction of the thickness, without compromising the resistance, for a consequent reduction of the production cost and energy saving of the boat during its use...|$|R

The bridge is located on the 2, 097 th km over the Majersky creek (Majerský potok). The load-bearing structure of the bridge deck is composed of a composite steel-concrete grate structure acting as a continuous beam over spans of 33 m + 3 x 40 m + 33 m. The steel part of the load-bearing structure is made of welded built-up beams with a constant height of web 1440 mm and, according to the static design requirements, various thickness and width of flanges. The connection of the steel-concrete bridge deck with the steel structure is ensured by means of shear connectors welded to the upper flange.

5000|$|In roulette, the <b>en</b> prison <b>rule</b> is an {{opportunity}} to recover ones stakes after a spin of zero, provided ones bet was even-odds (i.e. high-low, even-odd, red-black). [...] It is a variant of the la partage rule, in which a player loses only half his even-odds stake if the original spin is a zero, recouping the other half (partage being French for [...] "sharing"). In European casinos, where la partage is customary, the player may be given the option instead to place his original stake en prison ("in prison" [...] in French). The stake is left on the previous bet, and the croupier places a marker on it to show it is en prison. If the bet wins on the next spin, the players stake is returned; if it loses, it is forfeited. [...] Different casinos adopt different rules for the case where zero comes up a second time: it may be treated as won, lost, la partage or en prison.|$|R

Skoien, [...] - Steven Skoien, a Wisconsin man {{convicted of}} two {{misdemeanor}} domestic violence convictions, appealed his conviction {{based on the}} argument that the prohibition violated the individual rights to bear arms, as described in Heller.

Skoien was convicted and sentenced to two years in prison for the gun violation, and will thus likely be subject to a lifetime ban on gun ownership. Editorials favoring gun rights sharply criticized this ruling as going too far with the enactment of a lifetime gun ban, while editorials favoring gun regulations praised the ruling as [...] "a bucket of cold water thrown on the gun rights celebration".|$|R

40|$|Low-flatcar wagons are {{designed}} to load entire articulated lorries instead of loading only the containers {{in order to make}} the loading and unloading stages easier and faster. This design implies a particular layout of the bogie and suspension system, aiming at minimizing the height of the flatcar with respect to the rail level. This solution influences the dynamic behavior of the wagons, reducing the steering capability and causing high lateral forces on the driving wheels when low-radius curves or turnouts are negotiated. Aim of the work is the homologation of low-flatcar wagons on the Italian railways. Besides the classical homologation procedure prescribed by the <b>EN</b> 14363 <b>rule,</b> a particular focus will be devoted to the running safety when negotiating turnouts. Indeed, it will be demonstrated that, under certain conditions, this is a very critical running condition for these vehicles. First, a numerical analysis is performed to identify the most critical condition. Then, this condition is reproduced experimentally, measuring the wheel-rail contact forces in order to assess the running safety of these wagons...|$|R
40|$|Artículos <b>en</b> revistasPricing <b>rules</b> in {{wholesale}} {{electricity markets}} are usually classified around two major groups, namely linear (aka non-discriminatory) and non-linear (aka discriminatory). As well known, {{the major difference}} lies on the way non-convexities are considered in the computation of market prices. According to the classical marginal pricing theories, the resulting market prices are supposed {{to serve as the}} key signals around which capacity expansion revolves. Thus, the implementation of one or the other pricing rule can have a different effect on the investment incentives perceived by generation technologies, affecting the long-term efficiency of the whole market scheme. The objective {{of this paper is to}} assess to what extent long-term investment incentives can be affected by the pricing rule implemented. To do so, we propose a long-term capacity expansion model where investment decisions are taken based on the market remuneration. We use the model to determine the optimal mix in a real-size thermal system with high penetration of renewable energy sources (since its intermittency enhances the relevance of non-convexities), when alternatively considering the aforementioned pricing schemes. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

5000|$|In American roulette, {{there are}} two [...] "zeroes" [...] (0, 00) and 36 non-zero numbers (18 red and 18 black). This leads to a higher house edge {{compared}} to the European roulette. The chances of a player, who bets 1 unit on red, winning is 18/38 and his chances of losing 1 unit is 20/38. The player's expected value is EV = (18/38 x 1) + (20/38 x -1) = 18/38 - 20/38 = -2/38 = -5.26%. Therefore, the house edge is 5.26%. After 10 spins, betting 1 unit per spin, the average house profit will be 10 x 1 x 5.26% = 0.53 units. Of course, the casino may not win exactly 53 cents of a unit; this figure is the average casino profit from each player if it had millions of players each betting for 10 spins at 1 unit per spin. European and French roulette wheels have only one [...] "zero" [...] and therefore the house advantage (ignoring the <b>en</b> prison <b>rule)</b> is equal to 1/37 = 2.7%.|$|R
