50|$|In simple terms, Metcalfe had {{designed}} a rectangular wooden block, bored along its upper edge for eight rifle cartridges, {{that could be}} attached {{to the side of the}} Springfield rifle just ahead of the lock... This cartridge block was affixed to the weapon by means of a special lock mechanism inletted into the stock. Several of these blocks, filled with cartridges, were to be carried on a special waist belt using a clip carrier made of spring steel with a leather <b>fastening</b> <b>strap</b> for each block. The blocks were to be made and loaded with cartridges at the army's principal ammunition plant, Frankford Arsenal.|$|E
5000|$|Siffredi {{was forced}} to choose an {{alternative}} route to the one he considered the [...] "Holy Grail" [...] of snowboarding, as the coveted Hornbein Couloir {{did not have enough}} snow. Instead, he rode down the Norton Couloir for the historic ride back to Advanced Base Camp (ABC) {{at the foot of the}} North Col. Then began the descent down the Norton Couloir of the north face, but after only 200 meters a <b>fastening</b> <b>strap</b> on his snowboard broke due to the intense cold (- 35 Â°C). After repairing it with help from a sherpa, Siffredi continued the descent to 6,400 meters in two hours.|$|E
50|$|A leg rope or leash is a {{urethane}} cord {{attached to}} {{the deck of a}} surfboard, down near the tail. A leg rope plug enables the leg rope to be attached here using a leg rope string. The other end of the leg rope is secured tightly around the surfer's ankle with a velcro <b>fastening</b> <b>strap</b> covered in neoprene to provide comfort for the user. The purpose of using a leg rope is to keep the surfboard attached to a surfer's ankle at a safe distance. Should the surfer fall whilst riding a wave, the surfboard will not be swept away, thus allowing the surfer to quickly recover his surfboard and return to the take-off zone. The leg rope was invented in the 1970s amidst controversy that it was a dangerous accessory. Initially, a minority of people expressed concern that if a surfer fell whilst riding a wave and wearing a leg rope, the surfboard may bounce back and hit the surfer causing serious injury. Although this can happen, most surfers today choose to use a leg rope whilst surfing as it is believed that leg ropes prevent more accidents than they cause.|$|E
25|$|Variable-contour cuffs are contour cuffs {{that can}} be {{adjusted}} {{to the shape of}} the limb. They have pivoting <b>fastening</b> <b>straps</b> that allow the proximal and distal circumferences to be adjusted, allowing the cuff to conform to a variety of limb shapes, and thus be personalized to each patient. Variable-contour cuffs enhance comfort in patients with tapered limbs, decrease the risk of mechanical shearing, and can occlude blood flow at lower pressures due to the improved fit to the limb.|$|R

60|$|I <b>fastened</b> the <b>straps</b> round Dan's broad shoulders. His {{shirt was}} as wet {{as if he}} had fallen overboard. Maybe some of that wet was spray. His face was purple, his big arms bulging, and he whistled as he breathed.|$|R

50|$|The {{power unit}} {{can be broken}} down to a size of 32 X 24 X 18 inches (81.3 X 61.0 X 45.7 cm) for ground {{transportation}} in an automobile trunk. Reassembly requires only <b>fastening</b> nine Velcro <b>straps.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The boot {{is usually}} placed onto the horse with the straps facing towards the rear {{on the outside}} of the leg, unless the {{attachment}} design mandates a different placement. To ensure there is even pressure around the leg when putting the boot on, they are <b>fastened</b> middle <b>strap</b> first, then the others. Boots that are too tight can cause discomfort and pressure injuries, but those that are too loose may become dislodged or come off entirely.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Leave off {{breaking}} the swords,' cried the man, 'and {{look at this}} old sword and helmet and tunic that I wore in the wars of your grandfather. Perhaps you may find them of stouter steel.' And Manus bent the sword thrice across his knee {{but he could not}} break it. So he girded it to his side, and put on the old helmet. As he <b>fastened</b> the <b>strap</b> his eye fell on a cloth flapping outside the window.|$|R
50|$|Cricket pads first {{appeared}} in the mid 18th century in England. They were developed to protect {{the lower part of the}} legs from the hard leather ball that was used to bowl deliveries in the game. The development of pads led to a change in the Laws of Cricket with the addition of the dismissal for LBW. It was introduced in 1774 because batsmen had begun using their pads to deflect balls away from their wickets. Batting pads protect the shins, knees and the lower thigh. At the base, there is a slot for the foot. Traditional pads were made from canvas which had cotton stuffing inserted between stitched-in cane wood strips that ran vertically up to the knee roll. The material would then be painted white with water-soluble canvas paint. Leather buckles were used to bind the pad to the leg. These natural material pads were quite heavy. By contrast, modern day pads are now made from durable and ultra light synthetic materials such as PVC for the outer and polyesters for the lining. Most pads use three velcro <b>fastening</b> <b>straps</b> making them easily adjustable and removable.|$|R
50|$|Strapping, {{also known}} as {{bundling}} and banding, {{is the process of}} applying a strap to an item to combine, stabilize, hold, reinforce, or <b>fasten</b> it. The <b>strap</b> may also be referred to as strapping. Strapping is most commonly used in the packaging industry.|$|R
40|$|Assistive and rehabilitative powered exoskeletons for {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) and stroke {{subjects}} have recently reached the clinic. Proper tension and joint alignment are critical to ensuring safety. Challenges still exist in adjustment and fitting, with most current systems depending on personnel experience for appropriate individual fastening. Paraplegia and tetraplegia patients using these devices have impaired sensation and cannot signal if straps are uncomfortable or painful. Excessive pressure and blood-flow restriction can lead to skin ulcers, necrotic tissue and infections. Tension must be just enough to prevent slipping and maintain posture. Research in pressure dynamics is extensive for wheelchairs and mattresses, but {{little research has been}} done on exoskeleton straps. We present a system to monitor pressure exerted by physical human-machine interfaces and provide data about levels of skin/body pressure in <b>fastening</b> <b>straps.</b> The system consists of sensing arrays, signal processing hardware with wireless transmission, and an interactive GUI. For validation, a lower-body powered exoskeleton carrying the full weight of users was used. Experimental trials were conducted with one SCI and one able-bodied subject. The system can help prevent skin injuries related to excessive pressure in mobility-impaired patients using powered exoskeletons, supporting functionality, independence and better overall quality of life...|$|R
50|$|Another device used {{to immobilise}} {{offenders}} was a birching table, used in Scotland, with two {{holes in it}} through which the offender's arms were inserted but otherwise left free and untied.

50|$|<b>Fastening</b> the <b>straps</b> to the ski {{was always}} a challenge, often {{requiring}} slots to be cut into the ski. A key advance was introduced by Fritz R. Huitfeldt, who used a metal plate that was screwed onto {{the top of the}} ski with short vertical extensions that had holes to attach the straps to. The major advantage to this design is that the vertical extensions held the boot firmly centered on the ski, whereas the former all-strap systems generally had considerable flop. Variations on this design led to the shaping of the metal plate to progressively hold the toe more firmly.|$|R
5000|$|Created in 1934 by Nibel and chassis {{engineer}} Max Wagner. the 150H was a two-seat sports roadster. It featured {{transverse leaf spring}} front and coil-sprung swing axle rear suspension. A water-cooled [...] OHC four-cylinder engine, producing , was mounted in back, hence the [...] "H", from German heck (rear). The radiator was behind that, above the transaxle, with a squirrel-cage blower (reminiscent of the VW Type 1) feeding both radiator and carburetor.
