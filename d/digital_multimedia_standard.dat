The increasing pervasiveness of digital broadcasting will be seen in not only {{changing the face of}} traditional audio and video broadcasting, but also in an increase in breadth of scope for future applications that deliver a wide spectrum of data for diverse fields beyond entertainment. In this paper, the authors survey existing, as well as suggest novel applications of digital broadcast technologies that may emerge outside of the traditional area of audio and video broadcast applications and discuss the technology-enablers that may be required to realise such applications...|$|R
30|$|There {{are several}} {{standards}} currently used worldwide for digital terrestrial broadcasting [1]. The first introduced was the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC), now used in North America and South Korea. Digital Video Broadcasting - Terrestrial (DVB-T) is the European-based consortium standard, used apart from Europe in Australia, India, {{and some other}} Asian and African countries. The Japanese standard for digital terrestrial television is called Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting - Terrestrial (ISDB-T), adopted after ATSC and DVB-T {{taking into account the}} experience gained with the older standards and it is widely used in South America. Besides those three international standards for digital terrestrial broadcasting, there is also Chinese <b>Digital</b> Terrestrial <b>Multimedia</b> Broadcast <b>standard</b> for fixed and mobile users. Two significant standards for terrestrial mobile TV reception are Terrestrial - <b>Digital</b> <b>Multimedia</b> Broadcasting (T-DMB) and Digital Video Broadcasting - Handheld (DVB-H). The first one was developed in South Korea and its physical parameters are identical to the European Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) standard. T-DMB is being put into use in many countries around the world. On the other side, DVB-H is the preferred technology for terrestrial mobile broadcasting services in Europe.|$|R

We discuss how they are specified and propose techniques for their implementation within a distributed multimedia environment. ii 1 1 Introduction Multimedia services, in which stored media objects are retrieved on demand by end users, are rapidly emerging to be offered on digital communication networks. There are two distinguishing requirements of media playback: intra-media continuity and inter-media synchronization [6]. In the emerging international <b>multimedia</b> encoding <b>standard</b> MPEG (Motion Picture Experts Group), continuity and synchronization are handled at different layers of the multimedia stream.

40|$|The {{growth of}} the Internet and the {{explosion}} of digital communication technologies in the 1990 s {{have given rise to}} the importance of <b>digital</b> <b>multimedia</b> in the American economy. We define multimedia as the transmission of content through a combination of text, graphics, pictures, sound, animation, video, and hyperlinks, resulting in communication that is multisensory and potentially interactive. Multimedia has had an impact on Internet marketing, the music and motion picture industries, the education industry, and healthcare. It is therefore relevant to marketing and information systems and would seem to have a place in business curricula. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe the potential role for <b>digital</b> <b>multimedia</b> in a business curriculum. A review of multimedia offerings in higher education indicates that the concepts, technical aspects, and creation of <b>digital</b> <b>multimedia</b> are taught variously in computer science, the creative arts, communication, or psychology but are largely absent from the domain of business disciplines. We report on our experiences teaching a three-credit, 15 -week, junior/senior-level <b>Digital</b> <b>Multimedia</b> course under the Computer Information Systems heading. Topics associated with the course include conceptual understanding of <b>digital</b> <b>multimedia,</b> business and legal issues surrounding <b>digital</b> <b>multimedia,</b> and technical underpinnings and skills in the creation of multimedia. A key component of the course is a semester-long team project on a topic selected by each group of students. Challenges in teaching the course include cost of hardware, software, and facilities; containment of the scope of topics; differing expectations of students entering the course; and availability of support materials...|$|R

40|$|As {{the use of}} <b>digital</b> <b>multimedia</b> content such as {{images and}} video has increased, so has the means and the {{incentive}} to create digital forgeries. Presently, powerful editing software allows forgers to create perceptually convincing digital forgeries. Accordingly, {{there is a great}} need for techniques capable of authenticating <b>digital</b> <b>multimedia</b> content. In response to this, researchers have begun developing digital forensic techniques capable of identifying digital forgeries. These forensic techniques operate by detecting imperceptible traces left by editing operations in <b>digital</b> <b>multimedia</b> content. In this dissertation, we propose several new digital forensic techniques to detect evidence of editing in <b>digital</b> <b>multimedia</b> content. We begin by identifying the fingerprints left by pixel value mappings and show how these can be used to detect the use of contrast enhancement in images. We use these fingerprints to perform a number of additional forensic tasks such as identifying cut-and-paste forgeries, detecting the addition of noise to previously JPEG compressed images, and estimating the contrast enhancement mapping used to alter an image. Additionally, we consider the problem of multimedia security from the forger’...|$|R
