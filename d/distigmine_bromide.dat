50|$|Distigmine (as <b>distigmine</b> <b>bromide)</b> is a parasympathomimetic. Distigmine {{is similar}} to pyridostigmine and {{neostigmine}} but has a longer duration of action. It is available as tablets on prescription only. Distigmine has {{a greater risk of}} causing cholinergic crisis because of accumulation of the drug being more likely than with neostigmine or pyridostigmine and so distigmine is rarely used as a treatment for myasthenia gravis, unlike pyridostigmine and neostigmine.|$|E
40|$|Therapeutic {{effect of}} Robaveron was {{evaluated}} {{by means of}} the double blind method with <b>Distigmine</b> <b>Bromide</b> as a standard drug and a placebo. The drugs were administered in a double dummy fashion. The Robaveron group showed the best result compared with the <b>Distigmine</b> <b>Bromide</b> or placebo group in decrease of residual urine, improvement of practical residual urine rate, and the over-all voiding efficiency. Robaveron was also proved to be excellent in the over-all improvement, usefullness and safty. Through this study pathophysiology of neurogenic bladder dysfunction to which Robaveron is indicated was cleared...|$|E

Methods: We measured the post-void residual urinary volume in 19 patients with underactive bladders. All these patients had been under treatment with <b>distigmine</b> <b>bromide</b> and were prescribed acotiamide hydrochloride hydrate at a dose of 100 mg three times daily for 2 weeks. Results: Compared with the post-void residual urinary volume value at baseline (161. 4 ± 90. 0 mL) a statistically significant reduction was observed {{at the end of}} treatment (116. 3 ± 63. 1 mL) (P= 0. 006). The drug was generally well tolerated by the majority of patients. Conclusion: Maybe, acotiamide hydrochloride hydrate showed clinical efficacy in patients with underactive bladders and may, therefore, be used alternatively in patients who do not respond sufficiently to <b>distigmine</b> <b>bromide.</b> Keywords: acotiamide hydrochloride hydrate, <b>distigmine</b> <b>bromide,</b> underactive bladder, detrusor underactiv...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. In {{women who}} {{reported}} a weak urinary stream, {{the efficacy of}} treatment chosen according to the urodynamic findings on pressure-flow study was prospectively evaluated. Materials and Methods. Twelve female patients with maximum flow rates of 10 [*]mL/sec or lower were analyzed in the present study. At baseline, all underwent pressure-flow study to determine the degree of bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) and status of detrusor contractility on Schäfer's diagram. <b>Distigmine</b> <b>bromide,</b> 10 [*]mg/d, {{was given to the}} patients with detrusor underactivity (DUA) defined as weak/very weak contractility, whereas urethral dilatation was performed using a metal sound for those with BOO (linear passive urethral resistance relation 2 – 6). Treatment efficacy was evaluated using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), uroflowmetry, and measurement of postvoid residual urine volume. Some patients underwent pressure-flow study after treatment. Results. Urethral dilatation was performed for six patients with BOO, while <b>distigmine</b> <b>bromide</b> was given to the remaining six showing DUA without BOO. IPSS, QOL index, and the urinary flow rate were significantly improved in both groups after treatment. All four of the patients with BOO and one of the three with DUA but no BOO who underwent pressure-flow study after treatment showed decreased degrees of BOO and increased detrusor contractility, respectively. Conclusions. Both BOO and DUA cause a decreased urinary flow rate in women. In the short-term, urethral dilatation and <b>distigmine</b> <b>bromide</b> are efficacious for female patients with BOO and those with DUA, respectively...|$|E
30|$|Fifty-seven {{patients}} had a TOT only; therefore, the catheter was removed 2  h postoperatively after which two post void residual urine volumes were measured. Four {{patients had}} persistently high residual urine volumes (> 200  ml). Two were commenced on <b>distigmine</b> <b>bromide.</b> Two required recatheterization {{for a further}} 24  h. One had a proven UTI treated with antibiotics. The other had extremely high residual volumes > 1, 000  ml, so had the tape loosened prior to discharge with subsequent normal residual volumes. A total of three patients in this group had postoperative UTI (5.3 %).|$|E
30|$|Sixty-eight {{patients}} had concomitant surgical procedures. One was excluded from further analysis as the TOT was removed following a bladder injury. Seven patients were treated for a postoperative UTI (10.4 %). Thirteen {{patients had}} persistently high residual urine volumes (19.4 %); 12 {{of whom were}} commenced on <b>distigmine</b> <b>bromide,</b> nine were also recatheterized for 24  h (10.4 %), and two had the tape stretched prior to discharge. One patient had urinary retention which did not settle and necessitated intermittent self-catheterization (ISC) for 8  months after which time her symptoms resolved.|$|E
40|$|The {{present report}} is Werner's-syndrome {{associated}} with a neurogenic bladder. The patient visited our clinic with the chief complaint of retention of urine and urinary tract infections. The diagnosis of Werner's syndrome was made because the patient had such clinical features as bird-like or "masked" face, short stature, graying of the hair in youth, cataracts in youth, skin changes like scleroderma principally on limbs, early menopause. After trans-urethral-resection of bladder neck and administration of <b>distigmine</b> <b>bromide,</b> her bladder function was improved, she could urinate by herself and she was free from urinary tract infections...|$|E
40|$|A 43 -year-old {{woman with}} {{anterior}} spinal artery syndrome was admitted with complaints of tetraplegia and urinary retention. Her bladder had capacity of more than 500 ml and was inactive, with low voltage of external urethral sphincter. She was treated with <b>distigmine</b> <b>bromide</b> and intermittent catheterization. 50 days later, urodynamic study showed normal bladder and incomplete coordination of external sphincter. A 78 -year-old man had chief complaints of urinary retention and paraplegia. A catheter was left indwell for 6 months. Then he was treated with intermittent catheterization, but urgency incontinence was still observed. We discussed the therapy of neurogenic bladder due to the {{anterior spinal artery}} syndrome...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} three {{drugs that are}} {{generally}} used {{for the purpose of}} improvement of neurogenic bladder were investigated on the experimentally produced non-reflex spinal bladder in rabbits by means of lower motor neuron lesion. The experimental drugs were DB (<b>distigmine</b> <b>bromide),</b> TTFD (tetra-hydrofurfuryl disulfide) and PE (prostatic extract). Through the physiological and biochemical experiments, it was concluded that the beneficial effect of DB was mainly due to the neurotropic action, and the one of PE was thoroughly due to the myotropic action in consideration of the results on tissue respiration and ATP-ase activity of the bladder muscle. TTFD showed both myotropic and neurotropic action, suggesting its mechanism of action being just between DB and PE...|$|E
30|$|In summary, out of 124 patients, ten {{developed}} a postoperative UTI (8.1 %) and 17 (13.7 %) had transient voiding dysfunction which required intervention. Fifteen were commenced on <b>distigmine</b> <b>bromide</b> (12.1 %), nine were recatheterized (7.3 %), three had the tape loosened (2.4 %), while only one had urinary retention necessitating ISC (0.8 %). The incidence of voiding difficulty and UTI was higher {{in those patients}} who had concomitant vaginal surgery {{compared to those who}} did not (19.4 % vs 7 % and 10.4 % vs 5.3 %, respectively). The higher incidence of UTI may be due to increased catheterization time, whereas voiding difficulty may occur more commonly due to extensive dissection around the bladder with anterior repair and vaginal hysterectomy.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was directed to propose sensitive, accurate and reproducible methods of analysis that can be applied to determine <b>distigmine</b> <b>bromide</b> (DTB), cyclopentolate hydrochloride (CPHC), diaveridine hydrochloride (DVHC) and tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride (THHC) drugs in pure form and pharmaceutical preparations via charge-transfer complex formation with 7, 7, 8, 8 -tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) and tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) reagents. Spectrophotometric method involve the addition a known excess of TCNQ or TCNE reagents to DTB, CPHC, DVHC and THHC drugs in acetonitrile, followed by the measurement of the absorbance of the CT complexes at the selected wavelength. The reaction stoichiometry is found to be 1 : 1 [drug]: [TCNQ or TCNE]. The absorbance is found to increase linearly with concentration of the drugs under investigation which is corroborated by the correlation coefficients of 0. 9954 - 0. 9981. The system obeys Beer’s law for 6 - 400, 20 - 500...|$|E
30|$|All {{patients}} had a urinary catheter placed in theater prior to commencing the procedure. Post procedure cystoscopy was not routinely performed; only after complicated insertions or {{in cases of}} suspected bladder injury. Patients who had the TOT performed as a day case procedure with no concomitant surgical procedures had their catheters removed 2  h postoperatively. Those who had additional vaginal or pelvic floor surgery had their catheters removed after 24 – 48  h. After removal of the catheter, all {{patients had}} two post micturition bladder scans to check residual volumes. If both were less than 100  ml, the day case patients were discharged home. In cases where both volumes were more than 100  ml, then two further volumes were obtained and, if persistently high, the patient was commenced on <b>distigmine</b> <b>bromide</b> (Ubretid®, Rhône-Poulenc Rorer) 5  mg daily for 7  days. This is a long-acting anticholinesterase used in detrusor underactivity [9] which is also licensed short-term for postoperative urinary retention and has been used successfully in our experience. If residual volumes were greater than 300  ml, the patient had an indwelling urinary catheter replaced for a further 24  h. Length of hospital stay varied among those patients who had additional surgical procedures, depending on the surgery performed and their recovery.|$|E
