25|$|The Invasion of Dagestan was {{the trigger}} for the Second Chechen War. In August and September 1999, Shamil Basayev (in {{association}} with the Saudi-born Ibn al-Khattab, Commander of the Mujahedeen) led two armies of up to 2,000 Chechen, Dagestani, Arab and international mujahideen and Wahhabist militants from Chechnya into the neighboring Republic of Dagestan. This war saw the first (unconfirmed) use of aerial-delivered <b>fuel</b> <b>air</b> explosives (FAE) in mountainous areas, notably {{in the village of}} Tando. By mid-September 1999, the militants were routed from the villages they had captured and pushed back into Chechnya. At least several hundred militants were killed in the fighting; the Federal side reported 279 servicemen killed and approximately 900 wounded.|$|E
2500|$|Aircraft engines {{usually have}} dual magnetos to provide {{redundancy}} {{in the event}} of a failure, and to increase efficiency by thoroughly and quickly burning the <b>fuel</b> <b>air</b> mix from both sides towards the center. [...] The Wright brothers used a magneto invented in 1902 and built for them in 1903 by Dayton, Ohio inventor, Vincent Groby Apple. Some older automobiles had both a magneto system and a battery actuated system (see below) running simultaneously to ensure proper ignition under all conditions with the limited performance each system provided at the time. This gave the benefits of easy starting (from the battery system) with reliable sparking at speed (from the magneto).|$|E
2500|$|With over 50 firm orders, it {{completed}} its first flight on 5 May in 1h 36min from Bordeaux-Merignac, starting a 1,200h flight test programme over 15 month : it climbed to 10,000ft (3,000m) for hydraulic, <b>fuel,</b> <b>air</b> data and landing gear extraction/retraction systems tests, then climbed to 25,000ft for acceleration/deceleration tests and basic autopilot and autothrottle operations. The second Falcon 7X should join in June, {{and the third}} with a full interior in September for long-range, endurance tests and interior sound level validation : Dassault aims for a 52dB sound level in the cabin, 4dB lower than other Falcons.

2500|$|On April 12, the ARVN General Staff {{made the}} {{decision}} to bolster the defences at Xuan Loc with units drawn from the ARVN general reserve. Subsequently, the ARVN 1st Airborne Brigade arrived at the Bao Dinh rubber plantation, while two marine battalions defended the eastern corridor leading to Bien Hoa. In addition, Tan Phong and Dau Giay received reinforcements from the 33rd Ranger Battalion, 8/5th Infantry Division, 8th Artillery Battalion and three armoured brigades (315th, 318th and 322nd Armoured Brigades). As the reinforcements were making their way onto the battlefield, South Vietnamese fighter-bombers from Bien Hoa and Tan Son Nhat flew between 80 and 120 combat sorties per day to support the defenders at Xuan Loc. At 2pm on April 12, South Vietnamese C-130 Hercules dropped two CBU-55 [...] cluster bomb <b>Fuel</b> <b>Air</b> Explosive on North Vietnamese positions in the town of Xuan Vinh, close to Xuan Loc, killing about 200 civilians and North Vietnamese soldiers. However, the ARVN also suffered casualties from the blast.|$|E
2500|$|The Russian {{strategy}} in 1999 was {{to hold back}} tanks and armored personnel carriers and subject the entrenched Chechens to an intensive heavy artillery barrage and aerial bombardment before engaging them with relatively small groups of infantry, many with prior training in urban warfare. The Russian forces relied heavily on rocket artillery such as BM-21 Grad, BM-27 Uragan, BM-30 Smerch, ballistic missiles (SCUD, OTR-21 Tochka), cluster bombs and <b>fuel</b> <b>air</b> explosives. (The TOS-1, a multiple rocket launcher with thermobaric weapon warheads, played a particularly prominent role in the assault). These weapons wore down the Chechens, both physically and psychologically, and air strikes were also used to attack fighters hiding in basements; such attacks were designed for maximum psychological pressure. They would also demonstrate the hopelessness of further resistance against a foe that could strike with impunity and that was invulnerable to countermeasures. In November, the Kremlin appointed Beslan Gantamirov, former mayor of Grozny, {{as head of the}} pro-Moscow Chechen State Council. Gantamirov had just been pardoned by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and released from a 6-year prison sentence which he had been serving for embezzling federal funds which had been earmarked for the rebuilding of Chechnya in 1995 and 1996. He was chosen to lead a pro-Russian Chechen militia force in the upcoming battle. Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo however refused to supply the militia with heavy weapons, limiting their combat arsenal to [...] "obsolete AK-47s" [...] and accused Gantamirov of accepting anyone who would volunteer, including rebel fighters. The militia, often used to spearhead the federal forces, suffered heavy casualties, losing more than 700 men in the battle.|$|E
