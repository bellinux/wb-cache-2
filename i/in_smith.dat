5|$|In all, the New Court heard 77 cases {{during the}} Old Court – New Court controversy. In the April 1829 case of Hildreth's Heirs v. McIntire's Devisees, the reconstituted Court of Appeals {{declared}} {{all of these}} decisions void. In 1935, <b>in</b> <b>Smith</b> v.

5|$|Following Nixon, the Democratic Party's state {{convention}} {{instituted a}} rule that only whites could vote in its primary elections; the Court unanimously upheld this rule as constitutional in Grovey v. Townsend (1935), distinguishing the discrimination by a private organization {{from that of the}} state in the previous primary cases. However, in United States v. Classic (1941), the Court ruled that primary elections were {{an essential part of the}} electoral process, undermining the reasoning in Grovey. Based on Classic, the Court <b>in</b> <b>Smith</b> v. Allwright (1944), overruled Grovey, ruling that denying non-white voters a ballot in primary elections was a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment. In the last of the Texas primary cases, Terry v. Adams (1953), the Court ruled that black plaintiffs were entitled to damages from a group that organized whites-only pre-primary elections with the assistance of Democratic party officials.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, a {{small group}} of American Nazis, led by Frank Collin, applied to the town of Skokie, Illinois for {{permission}} to hold a demonstration in the town park. Skokie at the time had a majority population of Jews, totaling 40,000 of 70,000 citizens, some of whom were survivors of Nazi concentration camps. Skokie refused to grant permission, and an Illinois judge supported Skokie and prohibited the demonstration. Skokie immediately passed three ordinances aimed at preventing the group from meeting in Skokie. The ACLU assisted Collin and appealed to federal court. The appeal dragged on for a year, and the ACLU eventually prevailed <b>in</b> <b>Smith</b> v. Collin, 447 F.Supp. 676.The federal appeal case was Smith v. Collin 447 F.Supp. 676.

5|$|The action brought repercussions for Smith, whose {{failure to}} support Osborne was noted; {{although}} Smith {{claimed that he}} was simply maintaining the line of battle, it subsequently emerged that the captains had engaged in a personal dispute resulting <b>in</b> <b>Smith</b> deciding to refuse Osborne's orders. After his behaviour had featured in Osborne's initial dispatch, Smith challenged his account and Osborne demanded a court-martial held to investigate. This panel decided that Smith's behaviour was unacceptable and he was dismissed from the Navy, by which time he had lost Diomede, wrecked on a rock in Trincomalee Bay on 2 August 1795 during the invasion of Ceylon. Although Smith appealed his sentence and was restored to the captain's list in 1798 he was never again called to service and retired in 1806.|$|E
5|$|Helen {{went away}} for a period in June 1941, during which Parsons, {{encouraged}} {{to do so by}} the sexually permissive attitude of the O.T.O., began a sexual relationship with her 17-year-old sister, Sara. Upon Helen's return, Sara asserted that she was Parsons' new wife, and Parsons himself admitted that he found Sara more sexually attractive than Helen. Conflicted in her feelings, Helen sought comfort <b>in</b> <b>Smith</b> and began a relationship with him that lasted {{for the rest of his}} life; the four remained friends. The two couples, along with a number of other Thelemites (some of whom with their children), moved to 1003 South Orange Grove Avenue, an American Craftsman-style mansion. They all contributed to the rent of $100 a month and lived communally in what replaced Winona Boulevard as the new base of the Agape Lodge, maintaining an allotment and slaughtering their own livestock for meat as well as blood rituals. Parsons decorated his new room with a copy of the Stele of Revealing, a statue of Pan, and his collection of swords and daggers. He converted the garage and laundry room into a chemical laboratory and often held science fiction discussion meetings in the kitchen, and entertained the children with hunts for fairies in the 25-acre garden.|$|E

5|$|Smith also {{purchased}} and raced Thoroughbred horses {{under the name}} Pleasant Valley Stable. His racing colors during the early 1890s were royal-purple and canary yellow. Smith's brother, Bill, became his principal horse trainer during the 1890s and early 1900s. One of his most successful horses was a two-year-old bay colt named King Cadmus. Smith purchased King Cadmus as a yearling in 1890 for $4,000 at the stable dispersal sale of the late August Belmont. The colt was a son of Kingfisher and was a full brother to another popular racehorse named King Crab. The horse only won two races in his entire racing career, but Smith won $195,000 from Cadmus' two victories. The first win occurred on September 3, 1891 at Sheepshead Bay Race Track and resulted <b>in</b> <b>Smith</b> winning approximately $115,000, which was the largest payout from a horse race recorded in the US at that time. Cadmus' other win occurred at Morris Park Racetrack in 1892 with Smith netting another $80,000. King Cadmus was a fast runner {{but he had a}} vicious temperament, seriously injuring several of Smith's employees, in addition to weak legs and was sold as a three-year-old in 1892.|$|E
5|$|This {{extremely}} long-tracked EF4 tornado {{touched down}} near Raleigh, Mississippi, <b>in</b> <b>Smith</b> County at 5:42p.m. CDT (2242 UTC), and {{continued into the}} Uniontown, Alabama area before dissipating. The tornado initially downed trees, blew skirting from mobile homes, and tore shingles from roofs. The tornado intensified as it moved northeast across Smith County and produced up to EF2 and EF3 damage. One mobile home was picked up, bounced a couple times, and thrown into a tree line, where it was torn apart and debris was scattered up to a mile away, including the frame. The tornado mowed down a stand of pine trees and destroyed two frame houses, with major damage to the interior walls, and the exterior walls completely destroyed. Many power poles were snapped, a mobile home was annihilated, and a large shop building was completely destroyed as well. It then moved into Jasper County and snapped and debarked many pine trees. The first area of EF4 damage was observed near Louin as a frame home and several mobile homes were completely destroyed, with parts of the mobile homes being thrown long distances, {{and some of the}} frame home foundation being swept clean. The tornado caused significant damage to a poultry farm and cattle ranch before it weakened briefly. It then destroyed two mobile homes and caused extensive tree and power line damage. The tornado then produced a relatively narrow path of EF1-strength tree and power line damage for several miles, until re-intensifying near to EF3 strength near Rose Hill.|$|E
