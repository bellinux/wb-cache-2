25|$|The {{landmark}} {{judicial ruling}} of the Supreme Court in Roe v.

25|$|On July 1, 1991, President George H. W. Bush {{nominated}} Clarence Thomas for the Supreme Court of the United States {{to replace}} Thurgood Marshall, who had announced his retirement.

5000|$|Religious {{tensions}} arose {{once again}} in 1960 when the Democrats nominated John F. Kennedy, a Catholic who was elected.

25|$|Gregg has a {{moderate}} record on social issues. In June 2006, he joined {{six of his}} fellow Republicans in voting against the Federal Marriage Amendment. In April 2007, {{he was among the}} breakaway Republicans to support the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. However, his record on the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> is otherwise a solidly pro-life one. Gregg has voted for some gun control measures and against others. He voted against the Brady Bill, but in recent years has voted for trigger control locks on firearms and in favor of the ban on assault weapons.|$|E
25|$|However, many {{federal laws}} (i.e., those {{equalizing}} pay, employment, education, employment opportunities, and credit; ending pregnancy discrimination; and requiring NASA, the Military Academies, {{and other organizations}} to admit women), state laws (i.e., those ending spousal abuse and marital rape), Supreme Court rulings (i.e. ruling that the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applied to women), and state ERAs established women's equal status under the law, and social custom and consciousness began to change, accepting women's equality. The controversial <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion,</b> deemed by the Supreme Court as a fundamental right in Roe v. Wade (1973), is still a point of debate today.|$|E
25|$|Roe v. Wade, , is a {{landmark}} {{decision by the}} United States Supreme Court on the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion.</b> It was decided simultaneously with a companion case, Doe v. Bolton. The Court ruled 7–2 that a right to privacy under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment extended to a woman's decision to have an abortion, but that this right must be balanced against the state's interests in regulating abortions: protecting women's health and protecting the potentiality of human life. Arguing that these state interests became stronger {{over the course of}} a pregnancy, the Court resolved this balancing test by tying state regulation of abortion to the third trimester of pregnancy.|$|E

50|$|Francis told La Civiltà Cattolica {{that the}} church {{does not need to}} speak {{constantly}} <b>of</b> the <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion,</b> artificial contraception, and homosexuality. He thought that other issues, notably the duty to help those who are poor and marginalized, have been neglected. He added {{that the church}} had focused in trivial issues, and as such should not be so prone to condemn, and that priests should be more welcoming. He said the confessional should be used to motivate people to better themselves.|$|R
25|$|Historically, abortions {{have been}} done using herbal medicines, sharp tools, with force, or through other {{traditional}} methods. Abortion laws and cultural or religious views <b>of</b> <b>abortions</b> are different around the world. In some areas abortion is legal only in specific cases such as rape, problems with the fetus, poverty, risk to a woman's health, or incest. In many places there is much debate over the moral, ethical, and legal <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion.</b> Those who oppose abortion often maintain that an embryo or fetus is a human with a right to life and may compare abortion to murder. Those who favor the legality <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> often hold that a woman {{has a right to}} make decisions about her own body.|$|R
25|$|Stella Browne was {{a leading}} birth control campaigner, who {{increasingly}} began to venture into the more contentious <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> in the 1930s. Browne's beliefs were heavily influenced {{by the work of}} Havelock Ellis, Edward Carpenter and other sexologists. She came to strongly believe that working women should have the choice to become pregnant and to terminate their pregnancy while they worked in the horrible circumstances surrounding a pregnant woman who was still required to do hard labour during her pregnancy. In this case she argued that doctors should give free information about birth control to women that wanted to know about it. This would give women agency over their own circumstances and allow them to decide whether they wanted to be mothers or not.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, Hannan, as {{a retired}} archbishop, {{publicly}} opposed {{the election of}} Democrat Mary Landrieu, a Roman Catholic whose family had been Hannan's longtime friends, to the United States Senate. Although stopping short of endorsing (or even mentioning) Landrieu's Republican opponent, Woody Jenkins, the retired archbishop had become concerned, as he explained, by the endorsement of Landrieu by Emily's List, an organization devoted to pro-choice candidates on the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion.</b> Emily's List later ceased its support of Senator Landrieu prior to her 2002 re-election because of her congressional opposition to intact dilation and extraction (partial-birth abortion). Hannan's 1996 declaration has been cited as influential on later Catholic prelates involving themselves in politics by issuing warning statements about pro-abortion-rights Catholic politicians and in barring them from communion.|$|E
25|$|Campbell was the {{unsuccessful}} British Columbia Social Credit Party (Socred) {{candidate in}} Vancouver Centre {{for a seat}} in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia in 1983, receiving 12,740 votes (19.3% in a double member riding). Campbell ran unsuccessfully for the leadership of the BC Social Credit Party in the summer of 1986 (placing last with 14 votes from delegates), but was elected in October 1986 to the British Columbia Legislative Assembly as a Socred member for Vancouver-Point Grey, getting 19,716 votes (23.2%, also in a double member riding). Consigned to the backbenches, she became disenchanted with Premier Bill Vander Zalm's leadership and broke with him and Social Credit over the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion,</b> which Vander Zalm was opposed to. Campbell decided to leave provincial politics and enter federal politics.|$|E

5000|$|California: Incumbent U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer {{defeated}} California State Treasurer Matt Fong after {{a contentious}} race. Boxer, a staunch liberal {{who suffered from}} low approval ratings, was the most highly targeted Democratic incumbent senator in 1998. Republicans hoped that Fong would appeal to moderates, independents, and his fellow Asian-Americans. Fong pulled ahead of Boxer by early October, but a blitz of negative advertising by Boxer in the final weeks of the campaign that attacked Fong on the <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> and gun control helped boost the incumbent to a 53-43% win.|$|R
25|$|After the Republicans {{took control}} of the House in 1995, Traficant tended to vote more often with the Republicans than with his own party. On the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion,</b> Traficant voted with the {{position}} of the National Right to Life Committee 95% of the time in the 105th Congress, and 100% of the time in the 106th and 107th Congresses. However, he voted against all four articles of impeachment against Bill Clinton. After he voted for Republican Dennis Hastert for Speaker of the House in 2001, the Democrats stripped him of his seniority and refused to give him any committee assignments. Because the Republicans did not assign him to any committees either, Traficant became the first member of the House of Representatives in over a century—outside the top leadership—to lack a single committee assignment.|$|E
25|$|In Britain, the Abortion Law Reform Association {{continued}} its campaigning after the War, and this, combined with broad social changes brought the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> {{back into the}} political arena in the 1960s. President of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists John Peel chaired the committee advising the British Government on what became the 1967 Abortion Act. On the grounds of {{reducing the amount of}} disease and death associated with illegal abortion, the Abortion Act allowed for legal abortion on a number of grounds, including to prevent grave permanent injury to the woman's physical or mental health, to avoid injury to the physical or mental health of the woman or her existing child(ren) if the pregnancy was still under 28 weeks, or if the child was likely to be severely physically or mentally handicapped. The free provision of abortions was provided through the National Health Service.|$|E
25|$|The {{second season}} {{dealt with the}} practice's {{financial}} troubles. Naomi reveals to Addison {{that they are in}} danger of losing the practice due to unpaid debt causing Addison to tell Sam. This in turn causes a shift within the practice making Addison the new boss. Adding to the drama was the competition of a new practice, Pacific Wellcare. This new practice, located within the same building as Oceanside Wellness, was run by Charlotte causing turmoil for her and Cooper. Another happening within this season is the dynamic between Sam and Naomi who by the finale realize they can no longer be friends as well as the deepening romantic relationship of Cooper and Charlotte. Addison was romantically linked with Kevin Nelson (played by David Sutcliffe), a police officer, but later realized their relationship was going nowhere. Towards the end of the season, Addison falls in love with cardiovascular surgeon Noah Barnes, who as it turns out, is married and is expecting his first child. Matters become more complicated when Addison realizes that Noah's wife is one of her patients. Archer Montgomery (Grant Show), Addison's playboy brother, also made sporadic appearances causing trouble for her and Naomi. Archer was found to be with an aggressive brain tumor which was later diagnosed as parasites. Addison sought the professional help of her ex-husband, neurosurgeon Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey). After Derek successfully saved Archer, Addison discovered Archer was back to his old tricks cheating on Naomi. Violet stirred some of her own drama when she began dating Sheldon (Brian Benben), who works for Pacific Wellcare, and Pete. During {{the latter half of the}} season, Violet was found to be pregnant although she did not know who the father of her baby was. Furthermore, Violet found herself and her unborn baby at the mercy of a psychotic patient bent on taking Violet's baby by any means necessary in the closing moments of the season finale. Meanwhile, Dell struggled with his own issues caused by his former girlfriend's drug habits and the fight for custody of his daughter Betsey. Some of the medical cases that caused a stir and tension among the doctors at Private Practice was the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> (a first for the practice), the sex reassignment of a newborn, the sexual activity of a 12-year-old, the switching of embryos for two mothers-to-be and a young couple who later discovered they were siblings.|$|E
5000|$|The NCAN's {{position}} on the <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion,</b> homosexuality, and women clerics have put it {{at odds with the}} U.S. Roman Catholic Bishops.

Quinn calls herself [...] "a feminist and an activist and proud of it."

50|$|In 1983, Vandergriff co-sponsored {{a revival}} of the Equal Rights Amendment with full support from Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill. The bill {{contained}} nine amendments, most notably pertaining to <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> and women’s military service.The bill was ultimately shot down in the house because it did not receive two-thirds majority vote. In a last-ditch effort to push the bill through, O’Neil broke procedure and brought the bill to the floor by suspending House rules, which would thus not allow for any amendments to be included. Disappointed by the break in procedure, Vandergriff, along with 13 other co-sponsors from both political parties, reversed course and withdrew support from the bill.|$|R
