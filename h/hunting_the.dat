5|$|In 1823, Hugh Glass guides Andrew Henry’s trappers through unorganized territory. While {{he and his}} half-Pawnee son, Hawk, are <b>hunting,</b> <b>the</b> company's camp is {{attacked}} by an Arikara war party. Guided by Glass, the survivors travel on foot to Fort Kiowa, as traveling downriver will make them vulnerable. After docking, the crew stashes the pelts near the shore.|$|E

5|$|In {{recent years}} only villages in South Malaita Island have {{continued}} to hunt dolphin. In 2010, the villages of Fanalei, Walende, and Bitamae signed a MoU with the non-governmental organization, Earth Island Institute, to stop hunting dolphin. However, in early 2013 the agreement broke down and some men in Fanalei resumed <b>hunting.</b> <b>The</b> hunting of dolphin continued in early 2014.|$|E
5|$|Large's first {{operation}} with the SAS was in Malaya, <b>hunting</b> <b>the</b> Malayan Races Liberation Army (MRLA) guerrillas {{engaged in the}} Malayan Emergency uprising. By the time of Large's involvement there was little communist activity and, despite months of jungle patrols and encounters with leeches, scorpions, civet cats and tigers, he never had any contact with MRLA guerrillas.|$|E
5|$|Samus Aran is an ex-soldier of the Galactic Federation {{who became}} a galactic bounty hunter, usually fitted with a powered {{exoskeleton}} that is equipped with weapons such as directed-energy weapons and missiles. Throughout the series, she executes missions given to her by the Galactic Federation while <b>hunting</b> <b>the</b> antagonistic Space Pirates and their leader Ridley, along with the parasitic energy-draining organisms called Metroids.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Scav <b>Hunt</b> {{formerly}} held <b>the</b> Guinness World Record for largest scavenger <b>hunt.</b> To obtain <b>the</b> record, the Judges {{organized a}} miniature scavenger <b>hunt</b> during <b>the</b> 2011 <b>Hunt.</b> <b>The</b> smaller event {{was required to}} meet the Guinness World Record definition of a scavenger <b>hunt.</b> <b>The</b> Scav <b>Hunt</b> has since been officially surpassed {{for the title of}} the world's largest scavenger hunt by [...] "Passport to Provo," [...] an event organized by Provo and Google.|$|R

25|$|A famous {{example of}} this type of game was called the stag hunt; in the game two players may choose to hunt a stag or a rabbit, the former {{providing}} more meat (4 utility units) than the latter (1 utility unit). The caveat is that the stag must be cooperatively hunted, so if one player attempts to <b>hunt</b> <b>the</b> stag, while <b>the</b> other <b>hunts</b> <b>the</b> rabbit, he will fail in hunting (0 utility units), whereas if they both hunt it they will split the payload (2, 2). The game hence exhibits two equilibria at (stag, stag) and (rabbit, rabbit) and hence the players' optimal strategy depend on their expectation on what the other player may do. If one hunter trusts that <b>the</b> other will <b>hunt</b> <b>the</b> stag, they should <b>hunt</b> <b>the</b> stag; however if they suspect that <b>the</b> other will <b>hunt</b> <b>the</b> rabbit, they should <b>hunt</b> <b>the</b> rabbit. This game was used as an analogy for social cooperation, since much of the benefit that people gain in society depends upon people cooperating and implicitly trusting one another to act in a manner corresponding with cooperation.|$|R
5|$|The International Whaling Commission (IWC) {{issued a}} {{moratorium}} on commercial hunting of this whale, although Iceland and Costa Rica have resumed <b>hunting.</b> <b>The</b> species is also hunted by Greenlanders under the IWC's Aboriginal Subsistence Whaling provisions. Global population estimates range from less than 100,000 to roughly 119,000.|$|E
5|$|The note further elaborates {{that unlike}} {{the rest of}} the EU, where most guns are owned for <b>hunting,</b> <b>the</b> vast {{majority}} of Czech gun owners possess firearms suitable for protection of life, health and property, explicitly mentioning, inter alia, semi-automatic rifles (which are subject to the proposed EU Gun Ban, see above).|$|E
5|$|This {{nocturnal bird}} of prey hunts mainly rodents, usually by {{dropping}} from a perch to seize its prey, which it swallows whole; in more urban areas its diet includes {{a higher proportion of}} birds. Vision and hearing adaptations and silent flight aid its night <b>hunting.</b> <b>The</b> tawny owl is capable of catching smaller owls, but is itself vulnerable to the eagle owl or northern goshawk.|$|E
50|$|Ovid places him also at <b>the</b> <b>hunt</b> of <b>the</b> Calydonian Boar, {{although}} <b>the</b> <b>hunt</b> {{occurred after}} <b>the</b> Argonauts' return and Mopsus' supposed death.|$|R
50|$|Therefore {{one uses}} <b>the</b> spring <b>hunt,</b> <b>the</b> summer <b>hunt,</b> <b>the</b> autumn <b>hunt,</b> and <b>the</b> winter <b>hunt,</b> all in <b>the</b> {{intervals}} between agricultural labor, {{to practice the}} great services. Every three years {{there should be a}} review of the troops... The lord does not shoot any bird or beast whose flesh is not offered in the sacrificial pots or whose hide, teeth, bones, horns, fur, or feathers are not used on the sacrificial vessels.|$|R
5000|$|Fug 214 : This was an [...] "add-on" [...] unit to the SN2 {{which gave}} it a rear antenna. This was in {{response}} to Allied night fighters accompanying the bomber steams to <b>hunt</b> <b>the</b> German Night fighters while <b>the</b> <b>hunted</b> <b>the</b> bombers. The idea was to prevent allied fighters attacking the German fighters from behind.|$|R
5|$|A tabloid {{paper offers}} a $10,000 reward for the tiger causing {{the town to}} be {{inundated}} with hunters and reporters. The sheriff forbids anyone from going {{in the woods and}} <b>hunting</b> <b>the</b> tiger, but while out with Deputy Sharon Weinman (Sarah Constible), he sees Roy in the woods. They give chase, but instead find a dead tabloid reporter. The National Guard is called in to help. The sheriff later sees Roy in the woods again and warns him to stay out before taking him home and giving Rose the same warning. After he leaves, she mistakenly believes Roy told the sheriff lies about there being a tiger and chastises him.|$|E
5|$|Although Elizabeth Johnson {{was mistaken}} about the Pike village site, her mistake is {{held to be}} a {{fortunate}} one. The Webster County site had been subjected to decades of cultivation and relic <b>hunting.</b> <b>The</b> Republic County site was not entirely pristine, due to surface collecting and possibly to amateur excavation; but it was far better preserved. Today, the Kansas Historical Society operates a museum on the site, built in 1967 {{over one of the}} excavated earth lodges.|$|E
5|$|As well as plant based poisons, {{there are}} others that are made {{that are based on}} animals. For example, the larva or pupae of a beetle genus of the Northern Kalahari Desert is used to create a {{slow-acting}} poison that can be quite useful when <b>hunting.</b> <b>The</b> beetle itself is applied to the arrow head, by squeezing the contents of the beetle right onto the head. Plant sap is then mixed and serves as an adhesive. However, instead of the plant sap, a powder made from the dead, eviscerated larva can be used.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{participating}} in the CBS telecast of the pre-game show, Dan Marino also participated in the coin toss along with Norma <b>Hunt,</b> <b>the</b> widow of Lamar <b>Hunt,</b> <b>the</b> former owner of the Kansas City Chiefs {{and the man who}} gave the Super Bowl its name.|$|R
5000|$|The Master of Foxhounds (M.F.H.) or Joint Master of Foxhounds {{operates}} the sporting activities of <b>the</b> <b>hunt,</b> maintains <b>the</b> kennels, works with (and sometimes is) the huntsman, and spends the money raised by <b>the</b> <b>hunt</b> club. (Often <b>the</b> master or joint masters {{are the largest}} of financial contributors to <b>the</b> <b>hunt.)</b> <b>The</b> master will have the final say over all matters in the field.|$|R

5|$|Banded sea kraits {{primarily}} feed on {{varieties of}} eels, but also eat small fish. Males and females exhibit sexual dimorphism in hunting behavior, as adult females, which are significantly larger than males, prefer to hunt in deeper water for larger conger eels, while adult males hunt in shallower water for smaller moray eels. In addition, females hunt {{for only one}} prey item per foraging bout, while males often hunt for multiple items. After <b>hunting,</b> <b>the</b> banded sea kraits return to land in order to digest their prey.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the Clans' territories lies a {{mountain}} range, inhabited by the Tribe of Rushing Water. The Tribe {{is shown to}} be similar to the Clans, yet follows a different set of ancestors: the Tribe of Endless <b>Hunting.</b> <b>The</b> Tribe has a Healer, cave-guards, and prey-hunters, who each serve a different function in the Tribe. The Healer leads the Tribe, heals the ill and wounded, and communicates with the Tribe of Endless Hunting; the cave-guards defend the Tribe, and the prey-hunters hunt.The Tribe was formed by the Ancients when they left the lake to live in the mountains. In turn, cats from the Tribe moved to the forest of the original series and formed the Clans.|$|E
5|$|Biking and {{horseback riding}} are other {{recreational}} {{activities that are}} allowed on the road. The drive is popular in the fall months for leaf peeping to view fall foliage. Skyline Drive is closed from dusk to dawn from November to early January to ensure rangers can control illegal <b>hunting.</b> <b>The</b> drive can also close {{for a short time}} following snow or ice storms. Skyline Drive is designated a National Scenic Byway.|$|E

5|$|Cats {{have either}} a mutualistic or {{commensal}} relationship with humans. Two main theories are given about how cats were domesticated. In one, people deliberately tamed cats {{in a process}} of artificial selection as they were useful predators of vermin. This has been criticized as implausible, because the reward for such an effort may have been too little; cats generally do not carry out commands and although they do eat rodents, other species such as ferrets or terriers may be better at controlling these pests. The alternative idea is that cats were simply tolerated by people and gradually diverged from their wild relatives through natural selection, as they adapted to <b>hunting</b> <b>the</b> vermin found around humans in towns and villages.|$|E
5|$|Cocker Spaniels were {{originally}} bred as hunting {{dogs in the}} United Kingdom, with the term cocker deriving from their use to hunt the Eurasian woodcock. When the breed {{was brought to the}} United States, it was bred to a different standard, which enabled it to specialize in <b>hunting</b> <b>the</b> American woodcock. Further physical changes were bred into the cocker in the United States during {{the early part of the}} 20th century.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} part of the 18thcentury, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, kept red and white King Charles type spaniels for <b>hunting.</b> <b>The</b> duke {{recorded}} that they were able to keep up with a trotting horse. His estate was named Blenheim in honour of his victory at the Battle of Blenheim. Because of this influence, the red and white variety of the King Charles Spaniel and thus the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel became known as the Blenheim.|$|E
40|$|This bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} the {{compulsory}} connection of <b>the</b> rights to <b>hunt</b> with <b>the</b> ownership of <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> lands. <b>The</b> aim of this work is to divide and describe two kinds of hunting grounds according to the types of ownership of <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> lands. There is also an economic analysis of revenues and expenses regarding hunting rights in these hunting grounds. It further analyses the impact of diminishing of the minimum area of <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> grounds on <b>the</b> economy of <b>hunting.</b> It also tries {{to find out whether}} the diminishing would lead to hunting rights more interwoven with the ownership of <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> lands. <b>The</b> conducted research confirmed the existence of two types of hunting grounds that differ by the kind of ownership and also revenues and expenses regarding hunting rights in these hunting lands. It was further found out that the diminishing of the minimum area of <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> grounds would increase the bindingness of <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> rights with <b>the</b> ownership of <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> lands. <b>The</b> economic impact of the diminishing of the minimum area of <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> ground couldn't be unequivocally determined...|$|R

50|$|The game is {{inspired}} by Gregory Yob's seminal 1972 computer game <b>Hunt</b> <b>the</b> Wumpus. As in <b>Hunt</b> <b>the</b> Wumpus, the player's goal is to locate and defeat the title beast within its cave. However, Hunter, in Darkness emphasizes the setting, describing the cave in much greater detail than the earlier work.|$|R
