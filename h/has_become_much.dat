5|$|Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. is {{the first}} release by American metal band Slipknot. Released {{originally}} on October 31, 1996, it was limited to production of 1,000 copies. The band originally self-distributed some of these copies, but went on to release the remaining units through -ismist Recordings in 1997. Due to its limited release, the album <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> sought by fans since Slipknot's rise in fame.|$|E
5|$|Vampyr had {{a delayed}} release in Germany and opened to a {{generally}} negative reception from audiences and critics. Dreyer edited the film after its German premiere and it opened to more mixed opinions at its French debut. The film was long considered {{a low point}} in Dreyer's career, but modern critical reception to the film <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> more favorable with critics praising the film's disorienting visual effects and atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|Agriculture in Wales has in {{the past}} been {{a major part of the}} economy of Wales, a largely rural country that forms part of the United Kingdom. Wales is mountainous and has a mild, wet climate. This results in only a small {{proportion}} of the land area being suitable for arable cropping, but grass for the grazing of livestock is present in abundance. As a proportion of the national economy, the importance of agriculture <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> reduced; a high proportion of the population now live in the towns and cities in the south of the country and tourism has become an important form of income in the countryside and on the coast. Arable cropping is limited to the flatter parts and elsewhere dairying and livestock farming predominate.|$|E
5|$|Climate {{change and}} weather-related natural {{disasters}} also threaten lemur survival. For the last 1000 years, western and highland regions {{have been growing}} significantly drier, {{but in the past}} few decades, severe drought <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> more frequent. There are indications that deforestation and forest fragmentation are accelerating this gradual desiccation. The effects of drought are even felt in the rainforests. As annual rainfall decreases, the larger trees that make up the high canopy suffer increased mortality, failure to fruit, and decreased production of new leaves, which folivorous lemurs prefer. Cyclones can defoliate an area, knock down canopy trees, and create landslides and flooding. This can leave lemur populations without fruit or leaves until the following spring, requiring them to subsist on crisis foods, such as epiphytes.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{copyright}} on the songs. Hundreds of {{folk songs}} from the 19th century have known authors but have continued in oral tradition {{to the point where}} they are considered traditional for purposes of music publishing. This <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> less frequent since the 1940s. Today, almost every folk song that is recorded is credited with an arranger.|$|E

25|$|Hanukkah is not {{mentioned}} in the Bible and was never considered a major holiday in Judaism, but it <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> more visible and widely celebrated in modern times, mainly because it falls around the same time as Christmas and has national Jewish overtones that have been emphasized since the establishment of the State of Israel.|$|E
25|$|In the story, Piro has extreme {{difficulty}} understanding Megatokyos female characters, {{making him}} {{for the most part}} ignorant of the feelings that the character Nanasawa Kimiko has for him, though he <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> more aware of her attraction as the series progressed. Gallagher has commented that Piro is the focal point of emotional damage, while his friend, Largo, takes the physical damage in the comic.|$|E
25|$|Other {{significant}} trends {{during the}} 20th century were {{the spread of}} Anglo-Catholicism in Church of England parishes and the movement towards unification of the Anglican and Methodist Churches in the 1960s. As the bishops were sometimes High Church (e.g. W. H. Frere) and sometimes Low (e.g. Joseph Hunkin) administration of the diocese could vary from each episcopate to the next. The usage of Cornish as a liturgical language <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> more common.|$|E

25|$|In {{the last}} 150 years, Irish {{migration}} to Scotland increased dramatically. As time {{has gone on}} Scotland <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> more open to other religions and Catholics have seen the nationalisation of their schools and {{the restoration of the}} Church hierarchy. Even in the area of politics, there are changes. The Orange Order has also grown in numbers in recent times. This growth is, however, attributed by some to the rivalry between Rangers and Celtic football clubs as opposed to actual hatred of Catholics.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s the Treaty <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> more legally important. However, because of {{uncertainties}} about its meaning and translation, {{it still does}} not have a firm place in New Zealand law or jurisprudence. Another issue is whether the Crown in Right of New Zealand is bound. The separate New Zealand Crown was created when New Zealand adopted the Statute of Westminster in 1947, which granted legislative independence to New Zealand and created the Crown in Right of New Zealand. Martyn Finlay rejected this contention.|$|E
25|$|Because their {{patients}} are often seriously ill or require complex investigations, internists {{do much of}} their work in hospitals. Formerly, many internists were not subspecialized; such general physicians would see any complex nonsurgical problem; this style of practice <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> less common. In modern urban practice, most internists are subspecialists: that is, they generally limit their medical practice to problems of one organ system or to one particular area of medical knowledge. For example, gastroenterologists and nephrologists specialize respectively in diseases of the gut and the kidneys.|$|E

25|$|Written by two Americans with {{a strong}} country-western lyrical theme, the song was first {{released}} in Europe, where it <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> more popular than in the composers' native country, with a big-band/orchestral pop arrangement sung by Tony Christie. Christie's version was a major hit in Europe and a modest success in his native United Kingdom upon its release, then became even more popular in the mid-2000s when the song was reissued. As Christie's version failed {{to make a major}} impact in the U.S., Sedaka released his own recording of the song in 1977, which narrowly missed the top 40 but was an easy listening hit in the U.S. and Canada.|$|E
25|$|Photography and {{videography}} are the mainstays of recording, which <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> {{more convenient}} {{with the advent}} of reasonably priced digital still and HD video cameras. Cameras, including video cameras can be provided with special underwater housings that enable them to be used for underwater videography. Low visibility underwater and distortion of image due to refraction mean that perspective photographs can be difficult to obtain. However, it is possible to take a series of photographs at adjacent points and then combined into a single photomontage or photomosaic image of the whole site. 3D photogrammetry has also become a very popular way to image underwater cultural materials and shipwreck sites.|$|E
25|$|Economic growth <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> {{more modest}} {{since the late}} 1990s. A key factor to {{understand}} this new environment is the rise of China, offering the same conditions that made possible, 40 years ago, the Taiwan Miracle (a quiet political and social environment, cheap and educated workers, absence of independent trade unions). To keep growing, the Taiwanese economy must abandon its workforce intensive industries, which cannot compete with China, Vietnam or other sub-developed countries, and keep innovating and investing in information technology. Since the 1990s, Taiwanese companies have been permitted to invest in China, {{and a growing number}} of Taiwanese businessmen are demanding easier communications between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.|$|E

25|$|Americans {{initially}} {{believed that}} the proliferation of false parts mainly affected only smaller airlines; indeed, smaller airlines and repair stations were usually the businesses that were {{the most likely to}} be affected by fake parts. However, the FAA later found counterfeit parts in larger operations, including the discovery of counterfeit parts in aircraft of large, well-known airlines; even Air Force One, the aircraft used by the President of the United States, at one time contained fakes. As a result, illegal dealers and counterfeiters faced arrests, trials, and convictions. Schiavo stated that the among the most important actions taken by the United States government regarding the proliferation of counterfeit parts was the convictions of counterfeiters and illegal dealers. The FAA created a more rigorous documenting system to prevent the proliferation of fake aircraft parts and were eventually given the authority to press criminal charges on airlines who knowingly accept unapproved parts. In the 2000s, Schiavo said that aircraft parts are not counterfeited as often anymore because regulation of the spare parts industry <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> more strict than in the 1980s and the 1990s.|$|E
500|$|In {{the view}} of historians, such as Philip Williamson writing in 2007, the popular {{perception}} {{in the 21st century}} that the abdication was driven by politics rather than religious morality is false and arises because divorce <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> more common and socially acceptable. To contemporary sensibilities, the religious restrictions that prevented Edward from continuing as king while planning to marry Simpson [...] "seem, wrongly, to provide insufficient explanation" [...] for his abdication.|$|E
500|$|Jesus for President {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics in both secular and Christian media. [...] David Swanson wrote a three-part review of Jesus for President in Christianity Today, {{in which he}} argues that [...] "Claiborne and Haw make a compelling case that the church in America <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> too cozy with the state". Mark Tooley of the Institute on Religion and Democracy was heavily critical of the book, calling the book's pacifism both utopian and anti-American.|$|E
