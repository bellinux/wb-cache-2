5|$|Some tile {{types that}} retain the Holliday junction's native 60° angle have been demonstrated. One such array uses tiles {{containing}} four Holliday junctions in a parallelogram arrangement. This structure <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> allowing the junction angle {{to be directly}} visualized via atomic force microscopy. Tiles of three Holliday junctions in a triangular fashion {{have been used to}} make periodic three-dimensional arrays for use in X-ray crystallography of biomolecules. These structures are named for their similarity to structural units based on the principle of tensegrity, which utilizes members both in tension and compression.|$|E
5|$|The ESL {{is renowned}} for sonic {{transparency}} and very low distortion. Its midrange performance is usually described in superlative terms, common to other electrostatic designs. Its sound is tonally neutral, exceptionally spacious, and transient response very fast. A properly configured stereo pair would generate {{a very small}} 'sweet spot' where the sound stage snaps into focus. This led to criticisms of the speaker's directionality which in practice was rarely a problem and <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> reducing the effects of room resonances.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} to other contemporary space films, Gravity, facing far less competition, opened to a better-than-expected $55.8 million in 2013. In November 2014, Interstellar debuted to $47.5 million. Unlike Gravity and Interstellar, which <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> IMAX locations, boosting profits, The Martian was not initially playing in IMAX, since IMAX {{was committed to}} an exclusive run of Robert Zemeckis' The Walk. The Martian played in more than 350 premium large-format theaters including 2,550 3D locations. Also, the film was released several days after the announcement of NASA's discovery of water on Mars' planetary surface, which might have aided in boosting its opening. Ticket selling website Fandango reported that the film was outselling Gravity. Unlike Gravity, The Martian did not contain abundant 3D spectacle (even though it was filmed in 3D), and was longer than Gravity.|$|E

5|$|As 1989 wore on, Prost {{continually}} {{claimed his}} Honda V10s were not producing {{the same amount}} of power as those in Senna's car. It actually {{got to the point where}} Honda F1 boss Osamu Goto felt compelled to speak to the specialist British media on the matter. He claimed that Senna's foot-tapping style with the accelerator helped keep the RA109-E's revs up in the engine's mid-range where most of the power was, while Prost's smoother style dropped the engines into low revs where they had a pick-up problem. Apparently the talk was convincing until most of those present noticed Goto continually called them Ayrton and Prost respectively (per Japanese customs, addressing a person by their first name rather than the surname shows a much higher degree of familiarity and confidentiality). An example of Prost's claims came during the Mexican Grand Prix. Despite his car running less wing than Senna's which theoretically would give him greater top speed, Prost's McLaren was not able to pass Senna's on the long front straight even though he came of the final Peraltada Curve clearly faster than the Brazilian and also <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> a tow. In stark contrast, late in the race when Senna was lapping Prost (who was on fresh tyres), Senna was easily able to power past Prost on the straight.|$|E
5|$|In two instances, the equestrian {{portion of}} the Olympics has been held in a {{different}} location {{from the rest of}} the games. The first was during the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia when, due to Australian quarantine laws, the equestrian portion was held in Stockholm, Sweden. At the next IOC meeting, it was decided to hold a special Equestrian Olympic Games several months before the actual Olympics, complete with its own opening and closing ceremonies. This meant that Switzerland, which had officially boycotted the 1956 Games because of the Soviet Union's recent invasion of Hungary, still brought home a medal because of its participation in the equestrian portion several months earlier. The second instance was during the 2008 Summer Olympics, when the equestrian events were held in Hong Kong rather than Beijing. This decision was made when, in 2005, international veterinary groups refused to certify the main Olympic city as free of equine diseases. This would have resulted in horses leaving Beijing after the games and having to go through lengthy quarantine processes before being allowed to re-enter their home countries. Hong Kong also <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> having better facilities, including a top equine hospital and one of only a few equine drug-testing labs in the world.|$|E
5|$|The turnpike {{idea was}} an {{attractive}} one because initial construction {{was to be}} financed {{by the private sector}} via sales of revenue bonds, allowing state highway funds to be used for other important projects. The new toll road would also reduce traffic, and thus maintenance costs, on existing roads. There was also a concern that if Kansas lagged behind in turnpike construction, it might be bypassed by toll roads in other states, leaving it at an economic disadvantage. The toll concept also <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> ultimately putting the financial burden on the drivers who actually used the road, instead of using tax revenue that had been collected from residents statewide. There was a some opposition to the plan, from both government officials and citizens, due to concerns that the toll revenue might not cover the repayments to investors, bankrupting the turnpike authority and burdening the state government with the remaining debt. There were also worries about the possibility of the turnpike requiring maintenance before the bonds had been repaid. Some critics also felt that the high speeds typical of turnpike driving were unsafe. As right-of-way for the project was obtained, the turnpike drew opposition from farmers and ranchers, who objected to the turnpike bisecting their property, making it difficult to access disjointed parcels of land.|$|E

25|$|The Djinn was {{developed}} {{to function as a}} practical implementation of the earlier experimental Sud-Ouest Ariel rotorcraft. Atypically, the rotors were driven by compressed-air jets {{at the end of each}} blade, which <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> eliminating the need for an anti-torque tail rotor. On 2 January 1953, the proof-of-concept S.O.1220 performed its maiden flight; it was followed by the first of the S.O.1221 Djinn prototypes on 16 December 1953. During the subsequence test program, one of the prototypes was recorded as having achieved a world altitude record.|$|E
25|$|United Aircraft and Transport Corporation (UA) was {{a holding}} company created in 1928 that {{included}} Boeing Aircraft and United Air Lines, itself a holding {{company for a}} collection of small airlines that continued to operate under their own names. One of these airlines was Pacific Air Transport (PAT), which Boeing had acquired because of PAT's west coast mail contract in January 1928. UA sought a site for a new airport for PAT and found one in Burbank. UA <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> surveys that the Aeronautics Department of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce had conducted starting in 1926 to identify potential airport sites.|$|E
25|$|While the Kangal {{is often}} {{referred}} to as a sheep dog, it is not a herding dog, but rather a flock guardian that lives with the flock of sheep to actively fend off predators of all sizes. Typically used as protection against wolves, bears, and jackals in its native Turkey, the breed has been exported to African countries like Namibia and Kenya in more recent years due to its intimidating size and capabilities as an effective guardian, where it successfully protects local herds from lions, cheetahs, and similar indigenous big cats, which has <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> not only protecting livestock, but ensuring the continuity of endangered predators due to reduced cullings by local farmers.|$|E

25|$|Harvey stood {{down from}} Parliament at the 1918 general election, but tried to {{re-enter}} the House of Commons in 1922, having in 1921 been selected as Liberal candidate for Dewsbury in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Dewsbury had been Sir Walter Runciman's seat up until 1918, when, as {{an opponent of}} the Coalition government of David Lloyd George, Runciman had been opposed by a Coalition Conservative who <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> the government coupon. In a three-cornered contest Harvey nearly regained the seat for the Liberals in 1922, but lost to Labour candidate Ben Riley by 756 votes (3.3% of the total vote), the Conservative candidate Osbert Peake, later to be MP for Leeds North came third.|$|E
25|$|When {{originally}} {{built in}} the beginning of the 20th century, the Ottomans had the advantage of constructing the railway in what was then a relatively sparsely-populated area and as such <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> being able to lay the railway on the most topographically convenient route between Haifa and Beit She'an. The renewed railway's route however had to contend with the significant population that settled in the area since, a complex set of existing infrastructure built up over the years, strict environmental considerations, and the wish to preserve as much open space as possible along the route. Therefore, the new route was in places considerably more difficult to construct and in some spots is also less direct than the original alignment.|$|E
25|$|Evidence rapidly {{accumulated}} to {{show that}} natural selection was responsible. Using a method invented by L'Heretier and Teissier, Dobzhansky bred populations in population cages, which enabled feeding, breeding and sampling whilst preventing escape. This <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> eliminating migration as a possible explanation of the results. Stocks containing inversions at a known initial frequency can be maintained in controlled conditions. It {{was found that the}} various chromosome types do not fluctuate at random, as they would if selectively neutral, but adjust to certain frequencies at which they become stabilised. By the time Dobzhansky published the third edition of his book in 1951 he was persuaded that the chromosome morphs were being maintained in the population by the selective advantage of the heterozygotes, as with most polymorphisms.|$|E

25|$|The Spanish {{strategic}} {{intent to}} wrest from the Dutch their only military port {{in the western}} part of the North Sea, was offset by the conquest of Sluis and Cadzand by Maurice's army, which thereafter now was a new base of naval operations for the Dutch. With Sluis gone so too <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> a good haven for Spanish gallies a conveniently situated place for an invasion of the United Provinces which would have enabled the Spanish to disrupt Dutch trade. South of Sluis a line of fortifications was put in place – access to the Zwin was shut off, town walls were strengthened along with fortresses on both sides of the front. In that time, around Damme the 7-star-shaped fortifications were built and thus served as a defence bastion against Bruges.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 1850s, {{following}} the setting {{up of the}} Emigrant Depot in Toodyay, Drummond took the initiative to assist a number of married men with families who {{found it difficult to}} secure an employer. With the provision of a cottage, and acreage of virgin land for clearing and cultivating, the men were able to become self-sufficient and eventually purchase their own land. In the meantime Drummond <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> their labour and a source of grain for his mill. This enabled him to fulfil his contracts to the government's commissariat. He also offered this assistance to ticket-of-leave holders and by 1855 Drummond had eight families settled on his land. While some landowners were sceptical and refused to offer similar assistance, others saw the benefits and followed his example.|$|E
25|$|Newfoundland {{starts to}} release its own coinage. In 1865, the one-cent, five-cent, ten-cent, twenty-cent and two dollar coins were released. It was a decimal coinage that {{represented}} fractions of the Spanish dollar unit {{that was used}} in British Guiana. This <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> making one penny sterling exactly equal to two new Newfoundland cents. This was seen as a compromise between those who wanted Newfoundland to adopt the British system and those who wanted Newfoundland to adopt the American system. The Spanish dollar unit was slightly greater in value than the US dollar unit. This was because in 1792 when the US dollar was created, Alexander Hamilton at the treasury had weighed an average sample of worn out Spanish dollars, and the US dollar was defined based on that average weight.|$|E
