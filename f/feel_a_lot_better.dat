50|$|Marty Stuart's 2017 album Way Out West {{features}} a mash-up of I'll <b>Feel</b> <b>A</b> Whole <b>Lot</b> <b>Better</b> and some original Stuart lyrics.

5000|$|The song {{is built}} around a {{pounding}} riff that Clark later admitted was based on [...] "Needles and Pins" [...] by Jack Nitzsche and Sonny Bono. The song's refrain of [...] "I'll probably <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> whole <b>lot</b> <b>better</b> when you're gone" [...] betrays Clark's uncertainty about ending the relationship and whether such an act would be the answer to his problems or not. Mark Deming {{has pointed out that}} {{the use of the word}} [...] "probably" [...] in this refrain is key and lends the track a depth of subtext that was unusual for a pop song in the mid-1960s. Jim Dickson, The Byrds' manager, has noted that this level of subtext was not unusual in Clark's songs of the period. Said Dickson, [...] "There was always something to unravel in those songs, the non-explanation of the complex feeling. For instance, if you remember I'll <b>Feel</b> <b>a</b> Whole <b>Lot</b> <b>Better,</b> it doesn't say: [...] "I'll <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> whole <b>lot</b> better", but [...] "I'll probably <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> whole <b>lot</b> better." [...] For me, that makes the song. There's a statement followed by a hesitation." [...] Dickson would later work as a producer on Clark's 1984 album Firebyrd, which featured a re-recorded version of [...] "I'll <b>Feel</b> <b>a</b> Whole <b>Lot</b> Better".|$|R

This put him at an awkward angle going into the turn and resulted in him inadvertently [...] "punting" [...] Kenseth out of the groove and into the wall, bringing out the ninth caution. “Is there anything I can do or say right now to make it better?” Kenseth asked after the race. “The only thing I can do or say right now is make things worse, so really I’m just trying not to do that.” He added that feeling disappointment [...] "would put it lightly. It finished our season. Five minutes before that, it looked like {{we were going to}} have a chance to go race for a championship." [...] Busch took the blame for what happened afterwards saying [...] "I guess I wrecked a teammate. I feel horrible about it … Right now, it feels really (expletive), but tomorrow it might <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>better.</b> … The 20 should have been the Gibbs car to (advance)." [...] Logano after the race said he [...] "saw Kyle getting a run on him and I was like, 'Oh, boy! I knew Kyle was going to go three wide, and he has to. He's racing for a championship.

5000|$|Despite the simplicity, {{some models}} and their liveries {{could be quite}} clever, and Morestone/Budgie's forte {{seemed to be in}} {{selecting}} unique subjects not manufactured by other companies (Rixon 2005, p. 38). Distinct cars and smaller vehicles were wheeled air compressors, a tandem bicycle with two metal 'riders' and sidecar, a 1953 Packard Clipper convertible, a 1957 Plymouth Belvedere convertible, and a 1967 Oldsmobile 98 'town sedan' (Ragan 2000, pp. 46, 79-80). In trucks and construction, notable were the Morris [...] "Budgie Service" [...] breakdown lorry, the ERF low loader with electrical cable spools on the trailer, the strangely shaped ERF-articulated, mobile traffic [...] "Jumbo" [...] control unit, the Leyland tanker truck labeled with the phrase [...] "You'll <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>better</b> if you drink milk", or the R.E.A. Express Commer van with appropriate budgerigar illustrated on the van's sides (Ragan 2000, p. 71; Rixon 2005, p. 114, 143). One intriguing model was the Thornycroft Amazon salvage lorry with crane which raises and swivels - the model also features a separate auxiliary engine (Rixon 2005, p. 39). Another would be the early-1960s GMC delivery van with Hertz markings or the Bedford tipper truck with [...] "Ham River Grit" [...] written on the sides (Rixon 2005, p. 6).One assembly detail different on Morestone/Budgie models, compared to other manufacturers, is the painting of wheels after they have been attached to axles. The appearance of painted 'hubs' at times makes a buyer wonder if the model has been 'retouched' by a collector, but this is factory spec (Ragan 2000, p. 27; Rixon 2005, p. 39).|$|E

Everyone was just letting it all go on, only saying 'ooh, isn't it terrible?', but not engaging or trying to understand why these things were happening, or not even having an opinion about our role in all of it.

Jonathan Higgs on the album's lyrics, in an interview with The Line of Best Fit The album's themes revolve around the current affairs of 2015, such as the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and the British media's handling of the United Kingdom general election, as well as on the state of humanity. Lead writer Higgs spent a year writing the album, time he spent [...] "watching rolling news" [...] and enveloping himself in current events. Pritchard told the London Evening Standard that [...] "we're in an age where we're more conscious of and violence, you've got rolling news and you're constantly bombarded by information". Speaking to Chris Parkin of Red Bull, Higgs explained the songwriting process provided a kind of catharsis following the year's events: [...] "It wasn't until after we finished that I looked back and thought, bloody hell, I was feeling that very heavily and I didn't realise until it was out of me." ...|$|E

5000|$|Music critic Mark Deming {{has noted}} that lyrically, [...] "I'll <b>Feel</b> <b>a</b> Whole <b>Lot</b> Better" [...] takes a sardonic view of romance, with Clark {{undecided}} about whether to break off {{a relationship with a}} woman who hasn't been entirely honest with him. The song dates from The Byrds' pre-fame residency at Ciro's nightclub in Los Angeles, as Clark explained during an interview: [...] "There was a girlfriend I had known at the time, when we were playing at Ciro's.

The autistic {{spectrum}} disorder includes different stands. Three of them are Autism, Aspergers syndrome and Disintegrative disability. An article overview has been made with the purpose to examine parents experiences of having a child that develops autism or a diagnosis within the autistic spectrum. The articles have been analyzed with a qualitative subject analyze and the authors have structured the result after found themes in the articles. The result shows that an early diagnosis is very important and that the parents receive good and proper support. If they get good support they can handle the situation much better. Parents of these children adapt remarkably over time and they <b>feel</b> mentaly <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>better.</b> There is still a traditional deviation between mothers and fathers in these homes.

The song's title is purported to have come about due to Ryder's thick Mancunian accent he was unable to say the phrase [...] "It's There", which was the song's original title, so it was change simply to [...] "DARE". Roses Gabor takes over the role of [...] "Noodle" [...] from Miho Hatori, who provided the vocals for her on the first album.

D-Sides features a demo version of DARE entitled [...] "People". This version contains the same background beat while lacking the majority of the keyboards and effects in the final recording.

40|$|American cities can {{be looked}} at in many ways, but one thing {{everyone}} {{should be able to}} agree on is that they are in big trouble. They are dilapidated, congested, trash-strewn, unsafe, rebellionprone, poverty-stricken, polluted, frightened, demoralized and generally on the run. They give every indication of being beyond hope, and little leadership or new ideas are in evidence suggesting otherwise. Actually all cities throughout the industrial world are in trouble, but U. S. cities seem to be especially bad. In contrast, Toronto and Montreal, which Americans visit in great numbers, have a completely different tone. Not only do they look <b>better,</b> they <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> whole <b>lot</b> <b>better,</b> with <b>an</b> optimism and verve that is noticeably absent from Chicago, Cleveland, New York or Los Angeles. This is a striking paradox, that the richest and most powerful nation in the world is losing its ability to maintain healthy communities, that somehow material growth has created problems that are bigger than the people, not just in the environment but in social and psychological life as well. This article will be an attempt to take a cold look at this situation. The approach will be sociological, with an eye toward social relations and problems of organization.
