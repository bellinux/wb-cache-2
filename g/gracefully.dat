5|$|When Carey {{tries to}} open up a bit more, her sentiments are the {{equivalent}} of a Hallmark Precious Moments figurine. In a ballad 'Bye Bye', Carey isn't taking chances, designing the lyrics for mass appeal by dedicating them to anyone who ever lost somebody, be it 'your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady'. But Carey <b>gracefully</b> pulls off the universality of the lyrics, and the tune will likely be a massive hit.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 {{article in}} USA Today {{suggested}} that playing Magic might help improve {{the social and}} mental skills {{of some of the}} players. The article interviewed players' parents who believe that the game, similar to sports, teaches children how to more <b>gracefully</b> win and lose. Magic also contains a great amount of strategy and vocabulary that children may not be exposed to on a regular basis. Parents also claimed that playing Magic helped keep their children out of trouble, such as using illegal drugs or joining criminal gangs. On the other hand, the article also briefly mentions that Magic can be highly addictive, leading to parents worried about their children's Magic obsession. In addition, until 2007, some of the better players had opportunities to compete for a small number of scholarships.|$|E
5|$|Meyer added {{elements}} {{to reinforce the}} aging of the characters. Kirk's unhappiness about his birthday is compounded by McCoy's gift of reading glasses. The script stated that Kirk was 49, but Shatner was unsure about being specific about Kirk's age. Bennett remembers that Shatner was hesitant about portraying a middle-aged version of himself, and believed that with proper makeup he could continue playing a younger Kirk. Bennett convinced Shatner that he could age <b>gracefully</b> like Spencer Tracy; the producer did not know that Shatner had worked with Tracy on Judgment at Nuremberg (1961), and was fond of the actor. Meyer made sure to emphasize Kirk's parallel to Sherlock Holmes in that both characters waste away in the absence of their stimuli; new cases, in Holmes' case, and starship adventures in Kirk's.|$|E
5|$|At the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam, Nurmi {{competed in}} three events. He won the 10,000 m by staying right behind Ritola until sprinting past {{him on the}} home straight. Before the 5000 m final, Nurmi injured himself in his {{qualifying}} heat for the 3000 m steeplechase. He fell on his back at the water jump, spraining his hip and foot. Lucien Duquesne stopped to help him up, and Nurmi thanked the Frenchman by pacing him past the field and offered him the heat win, which Duquesne <b>gracefully</b> refused. In the 5000 m, Nurmi tried to repeat his move on Ritola but had to watch his teammate pull away instead. Nurmi, looking more exhausted than ever before, only barely managed to keep Wide behind and take silver. Nurmi had little time to rest or nurse his injuries as the 3000 m steeplechase started the next day. Struggling with the hurdles, Nurmi let Finland's steeplechase specialist Toivo Loukola escape into the distance. On the final lap, he sprinted clear of the others and finished nine seconds behind the world-record setting Loukola; Nurmi's time also bettered the previous record. Although Ritola did not finish, Ove Andersen completed a Finnish sweep of the medals.|$|E
5|$|Deserts {{present a}} very {{challenging}} environment for animals. Not {{only do they}} require food and water but {{they also need to}} keep their body temperature at a tolerable level. In many ways birds are the most able to do this of the higher animals. They can move to areas of greater food availability as the desert blooms after local rainfall and can fly to faraway waterholes. In hot deserts, gliding birds can remove themselves from the over-heated desert floor by using thermals to soar in the cooler air at great heights. In order to conserve energy, other desert birds run rather than fly. The cream-colored courser flits <b>gracefully</b> across the ground on its long legs, stopping periodically to snatch up insects. Like other desert birds it is well-camouflaged by its coloring and can merge into the landscape when stationary. The sandgrouse is an expert at this and nests on the open desert floor dozens of kilometers (miles) away from the waterhole it needs to visit daily. Some small diurnal birds are found in very restricted localities where their plumage matches the color of the underlying surface. The desert lark takes frequent dust baths which ensures that it matches its environment.|$|E
5|$|The Liberals did {{not take}} their loss of power <b>gracefully.</b> In May and June 1842, three uprisings broke out, in the provinces of São Paulo, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro. The rebels {{went so far as}} to arrest and hold hostage both Honório Hermeto's elderly father and uncle (who was also his father-in-law). As president, he {{commanded}} the provincial National Guard, and traveled through the province to organize a response. On 1 July, he advanced with troops towards Ouro Preto, where, after defeating the rebels, he freed his father and uncle. He joined forces there with Luís Alves de Lima e Silva (then-Baron and later Duke of Caxias), who commanded the National Guard of São Paulo and Minas Gerais and was also married to one of Honório Hermeto's distant cousins. The remaining rebels were easily defeated, and by late August, the uprisings had been quelled. Among the rebel leaders was the former regent, Feijó, who was arrested. He died shortly afterwards in 1843. As Honório Hermeto returned from Minas Gerais to Rio de Janeiro, he was welcomed with celebrations and demonstrations of joy by the authorities and populace of the districts he traversed.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{returned}} to England in 1147, {{when he was}} fourteen. Taking his immediate household and {{a small number of}} mercenaries, he left Normandy and landed in England, striking into Wiltshire. Despite initially causing considerable panic, the expedition had little success, and Henry found himself unable to pay his forces and therefore unable to return to Normandy. Neither his mother nor his uncle were prepared to support him, implying that they had not approved of the expedition in the first place. Surprisingly, Henry instead turned to King Stephen, who paid the outstanding wages and thereby allowed Henry to retire <b>gracefully.</b> Stephen's reasons for doing so are unclear. One potential explanation is his general courtesy to a member of his extended family; another is that he was starting to consider how to end the war peacefully, and saw this as a way of building a relationship with Henry. Henry intervened once again in 1149, commencing what is often termed the Henrician phase of the civil war. This time, Henry planned to form a northern alliance with King David I of Scotland, Henry's great-uncle, and Ranulf of Chester, a powerful regional leader who controlled most of the north-west of England. Under this alliance, Henry and Ranulf agreed to attack York, probably with help from the Scots. The planned attack disintegrated after Stephen marched rapidly north to York, and Henry {{returned to}} Normandy.|$|E

25|$|In general, an {{exception}} breaks the normal flow of execution and executes a pre-registered exception handler. The {{details of how}} this is done depends on {{whether it is a}} hardware or software exception and how the software exception is implemented. Some exceptions, especially hardware ones, may be handled so <b>gracefully</b> that execution can resume where it was interrupted.|$|E
25|$|The University Club (formerly {{called the}} Faculty Club) opened on March 16, 1982. The west coast design and cedar {{construction}} of the building lends itself <b>gracefully</b> to the natural picturesque setting in a wooded dale. The building, located on campus, is surrounded by high trees in a quiet, wooded area. Artistic landscaping with flowers and shrubs blooming year round {{are reflected in the}} adjacent pond.|$|E
25|$|Standing <b>gracefully</b> {{with its}} glass façade on the {{university}} campus, this building stands out from its adjacent traditional, brick, historical buildings. The building itself is pushed back from the street slightly, separated by a grassy area and paved sidewalk. Marking the boundaries of its site, a paved area (equivalent to the base area of the larger box) is also marked directly {{around the base of}} the building.|$|E
25|$|Other dances of {{the period}} {{included}} the Drum Dance (鞞舞), Bell Dance (鐸舞), Sabre Dance, and mixed couple dance (對舞). Fu Yi's (傅毅) Lyric Essay on Dance describes the Seven Tray Dance (七盤舞, also called Tray Drum Dance 盤鼓舞), a fusion of acrobatics and dance in which the dancer leaps <b>gracefully</b> between trays and drums on the trays, which gets faster as the dance progresses.|$|E
25|$|The {{final result}} was a chapel, {{complete}} with its unornamented yellow stock brick walls, a tall, eye-catching yet <b>gracefully</b> simple steeple, and simple botanically accurate rose windows, created a dramatic but tasteful and purposeful piece; one that epitomised its low gothic nondenominational function well, whilst establishing Abney Park as a local landmark visible from the thoroughfares of Church Street and the High Street, and from Woodberry Downs in the middle distance.|$|E
25|$|Holden {{continued}} for thirteen years to fit his engines with stovepipe chimneys, {{and also with}} Thomas Worsdell's capacious cab, with its <b>gracefully</b> curved side-sheets. Although for a time he continued with the Worsdell three-ring boiler barrel, with the dome on the middle ring, before long he designed a two-ring boiler with the dome on the front ring, immediately behind the chimney. He substituted Stephenson link-motion for the Joy valve gear preferred by Worsdell.|$|E
25|$|One day in 1952, Father Hurtado was {{stricken}} with intense pain {{and rushed to}} hospital. He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Day after day the media kept the country informed of Hurtado's state of health. Before his death {{he had become a}} national hero. True to the faith he had been professing all through his life, he accepted <b>gracefully</b> what was ineluctable. After a brief battle with the illness, he died in Santiago.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all other}} horns of antelopes, {{the core of}} a bongo's horn is hollow and the outer layer of the horn is made of keratin, the same {{material}} that makes up human fingernails, toenails. and hair. The bongo runs <b>gracefully</b> and at full speed through even the thickest tangles of lianas, laying its heavy spiralled horns on its back so the brush cannot impede its flight. Bongos are hunted for their horns by humans.|$|E
25|$|Some critics {{gave the}} album {{positive}} reviews, stating that Rihanna <b>gracefully</b> avoided the sophomore disappointment while others compared the album to her previous effort. A Girl like Me was released {{less than eight}} months after Rihanna's debut album. It peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200 and on the UK Albums Chart. The album was successful in other countries as well, entering the top ten in Ireland, New Zealand, Australia and Japan, while topping the charts in Canada.|$|E
25|$|The Body: Neapolitan jackets {{tend to be}} shorter in the back; in Neapolitan dialect, {{they say}} the jacket “zompa arrèto,” which roughly {{translates}} as “it jumps in the back”. This characteristic allows for the jacket to “slide” <b>gracefully</b> along the body. The vents on the sides are quite deep in Neapolitan jackets – up to 12 inches. The darts in the front {{go all the way}} down, to help the fabric follow the shape of the body and create elegant quarters.|$|E
25|$|Entering the 2009 Four Continents Championships in Vancouver, Canada as the {{defending}} champion, Asada placed 6th {{in the short}} program but won the free skating. Her first axel attempt was popped into a single, but she <b>gracefully</b> executed the second, garnering 8.80 points for the jump. She also completed a triple flip-double loop-double loop, a triple loop, and a triple flip-double loop. Asada placed third overall in the competition behind Joannie Rochette of Canada who won silver and Kim Yuna who won the gold.|$|E
25|$|In 669, a new Archbishop of Canterbury, Theodore of Tarsus, sent by Pope Vitalian {{arrived in}} England. He {{immediately}} {{set off on}} a tour of the country, tackling abuses of which he had been forewarned. He instructed Chad to step down and Wilfrid to take over. According to Bede, Theodore was so impressed by Chad's show of humility that he confirmed his ordination as bishop, while insisting he step down from his position. Chad retired <b>gracefully</b> and returned to his post as abbot of Lastingham, leaving Wilfrid as bishop of the Northumbrians at York.|$|E
25|$|Ralfs aided in {{the botanical}} {{portions}} of the Guide to Ilfracombe, 1838; the Guide to Penzance, by J. S. Courtney, 1845; the Week at the Land's End, by John Thomas Blight, 1861; the Official Guide to Penzance, 1876, and he supplied the list of desmids to Jenner's Flora of Tunbridge Wells. He sent many plants for description in the second edition of English Botany by Sir James Edward Smith. Berkeley gave the name of Ralfsia to a genus of seaweeds, and Wilson named a Jungermannia in his honour. Charles Darwin in his Insectivorous Plants <b>gracefully</b> referred to those supplied to him by Ralfs from the neighbourhood of Penzance.|$|E
25|$|Vishniac {{is notable}} for his {{photographs}} of insects mating, sea bass feasting and other living creatures in full animation. Skillfully and patiently, he would stalk insects or other such creatures {{for hours in}} the suburbs around New York City. Before beginning the hunt, he would lie {{for over an hour}} in the grass, rubbing himself with proximate flora to make himself smell less artificial. He would then <b>gracefully</b> swoop close to his prey and patiently frame the scene with an SLR equipped with an extension tube. He had even trained himself to hold his breath for up to two minutes, so that he could take his time and not disturb slowly exposing images.|$|E
25|$|The Helvellyn range runs broadly {{north to}} south for about 7miles, {{remaining}} above 2,000ft (600m) throughout its length. Helvellyn itself sits near the centre of this ridge and displays the characteristic form {{of many of these}} fells, namely smooth grassy slopes to the west and shattered rock to the east. Helvellyn sends out two eastward arêtes, razor-thin ridges between deep mountain corries. The southerly spur is Striding Edge, easily the most famous ridge in the district, and its northern partner is Swirral Edge. From the summit plateau of Helvellyn a rough slope drops to the start of Swirral Edge, and this narrow ridge curves <b>gracefully</b> down and then back up over half a mile, terminating at Catstye Cam.|$|E
25|$|The front {{facade of}} the {{residence}} consists of eye-catching peach and white brick masonry and stucco front porch with a main arched balcony crowned by a female face. A second, smaller, arched entrance is the main entryway into the porch and house. Early 1900s ironworks <b>gracefully</b> separate the front porch from the front street sidewalk. The front doors of the house are wooden louvered characteristic of the middle-to-late 19th century. A circular front wall wind hole with decorative molding accentuates the porch; another smaller circular opening decorates high above the archway into the porch. The interior consists of nine rooms, a long, sunny, lateral hallway with multiple wooden veneer shutters, and an external cobble-stone foyer leading to the back courtyard.|$|E
25|$|The siting or {{replacing}} of courts, gaols, {{police stations}} and other buildings {{around the state}} was also occurring at this time, following the establishment of 'responsible government' from Perth. He also supervised and designed new buildings or additions for the established towns Albany, the port; Fremantle, the centre of government; Perth {{and other parts of}} Western Australia. To meet the significantly increased population, post offices, schools, lighthouses and town halls were constructed in this period. Architectural reference was made to earlier colonial buildings, <b>gracefully</b> acknowledging the prior colonial architects, but existing ones were often removed to site the new plan. Large scale harbour, railway and other planning schemes were also realised during his time as 'government architect', and these also required new buildings and structures.|$|E
25|$|Portobello Road's {{distinctiveness}} {{does not}} rely only on its market. A range of communities inhabiting {{the street and}} the district contributes to a cosmopolitan and energetic atmosphere, as do the many restaurants and pubs. The architecture plays a part too, as the road meanders and curves <b>gracefully</b> along most of its length, unlike the more formally planned layout of most of the nearby area. Mid- to late-Victorian terrace houses and shops predominate, squeezed tightly into the available space, adding intimacy and a pleasing scale to the streetscape. The Friends of Portobello campaign seeks to preserve the street's unique dynamic, as the potential arrival of big-brand chain stores threatens the locals. Portobello Road is also home to the Grade II* Electric Cinema, one of Britain's oldest cinemas.|$|E
25|$|Repeated {{military}} defeats {{shook the}} public's {{faith in the}} French Directory. The Coup of 30 Prairial VII occurred on 18 June which pushed Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès and Paul Barras into leading roles and elevated Jean Baptiste Bernadotte to the post of Minister of War. There were two major forces in Italy, the 19,000-strong Army of the Alps under Jean Étienne Championnet and 40,713 men of the Army of Italy. The French government placed its hopes on Barthélemy Catherine Joubert to retrieve the situation as the new commander of the Army of Italy. Not only was Joubert a talented general, but he {{was believed to be}} lacking political ambitions and thus not a threat to the government. When Joubert arrived in the theater on 4 August, Moreau <b>gracefully</b> stepped aside and offered his assistance.|$|E
25|$|Less {{than one}} week later Glentoran {{appointed}} head coach Alan McDonald as manager. Roy Walker <b>gracefully</b> walked away but stated in the Belfast Telegraph {{that he would not}} rest until director of football Tom Dick stood down. Mr Dick then did so, but also criticised the club chairman Stafford Reynolds. Reynolds confirmed that he would step down if the right person could be found to take over. Alan McDonald, the new manager, has so far secured former Glentoran player Rory Hamill, Daryl Fordyce from Portsmouth, winger Jamie McGovern from West Bromwich Albion and Dungannon Swifts winger David Scullion and has re-signed Chris Morgan and Tim McCann. Darren Lockhart left the club at the time to join Crusaders on a one-year load deal along with defender Gary Smith. In January Glentoran managed to bring in Shane Mcabe from Dungannon and Darren Boyce from Coleraine.|$|E
25|$|The Marschallin, Sophie, and Octavian {{are left}} alone. The Marschallin {{recognizes that the}} day she so feared has come, as Octavian hesitates between the two women (Trio: Marie Theres'! / Hab' mir's gelobt). In the {{emotional}} climax of the opera, the Marschallin <b>gracefully</b> releases Octavian, encouraging him to follow his heart and love Sophie. She then withdraws elegantly to the next room to talk with Faninal. As soon as she is gone, Sophie and Octavian run to each other's arms. Faninal and the Marschallin return to find the lovers locked in an embrace. After a few bittersweet glances to her lost lover, the Marschallin departs with Faninal. Sophie and Octavian follow after another brief but ecstatic love duet (Ist ein Traum / Spür' nur dich), and the opera ends with little Mohammed running in to retrieve Sophie's dropped handkerchief, and racing out again after the departing nobility.|$|E
25|$|Looking at the {{relationship}} between the Leslie L. Dan Pharmacy Building and its greater urban context, it is evident that this building {{plays a key role in}} the overall composition of its immediate landscape. Its stately concrete columns along with the elegant, fritted curtain wall glass, creates a strong relation between the Ontario Hydro Building to the south and the MaRS Centre diagonally opposite. The materials used throughout these three buildings are very similar and they complement each other very well in the greater scheme of things. This building serves an important role at this junction, as its ties together other buildings found on and outside of the campus, forming a harmonious composition in its downtown urban context; while <b>gracefully</b> establishes its presence and importance on the school campus, standing as a tall elegant, state-of-the-art facility for the Pharmacy Faculty of the University of Toronto.|$|E
25|$|The Eagle Mk1 {{made its}} race debut at the 1966 Belgian Grand Prix, {{with a single}} car entered for Dan Gurney. The Eagle made an instant visual impact, with its <b>gracefully</b> crafted chassis clothed in dark blue paint, with a white-lipped {{radiator}} opening and a single white stripe running {{the length of the}} car's dorsal surface; an elegant interpretation of the USA national racing colours. Unfortunately for the team the car, despite its good looks, failed to finish. For the introduction of the new V12 engine at the 1966 Italian Grand Prix, Gurney took the wheel of the new car, and was joined by compatriot Phil Hill in the older Eagle-Climax. Once again it was an inauspicious start, with Hill failing to qualify, and Gurney retiring during the race. Gurney did score points during the season, at both the French and Mexican events, but on both occasions this was with the Climax-powered car.|$|E
