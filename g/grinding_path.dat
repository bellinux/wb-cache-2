In a typical arrangement, {{the material is}} fed onto a rotating table, onto which steel rollers press down. A high velocity of hot gas flow is maintained close to the dish so that fine particles are swept away {{as soon as they}} are produced. The gas flow carries the fines into an integral air separator, which returns larger particles to the <b>grinding</b> <b>path.</b> The fine material is swept out in the exhaust gas and is captured by a cyclone before being pumped to storage. The remaining dusty gas is usually returned to the main kiln dust control equipment for cleaning. Feed size can be up to 100 mm. Roller mills are efficient, using about half the energy of a ball mill, {{and there seems to be}} no limit to the size available. Roller mills with output in excess of 800 tonnes per hour have been installed. Unlike ball mills, feed to the mill must be regular and uninterrupted; otherwise damaging resonant vibration sets in.|$|E

However, it is really complicated to establish an exact mathematic equation to represent the conical flank surface of a twist drill. In order to simplify the problem and meet the practical engineering demand in the industry, this research focuses on developing an approximate mathematic model of the conical drill {{point geometry}}. Additionally, an integrated CAD/CAM software is developed. This software integrates the modelling function of flute, margin, point and split features and is able to calculate <b>grinding</b> <b>path</b> of each feature. With the help of this software, drill geometric parameters can be modified reasonably according to different requirements easier than ever. Finally, this research also mentions a CAD/CAM/CAE application to evaluate the cutting performance of a twist drill. The designed 3 D model can be imported in Thridwave to predict cutting force, torque and peak temperature during the drilling process. Based on these simulative factors, the cutting performance of a twist drill can be generally evaluated. Four evaluated designs were selected and ground by 5 -axis CNC grinding machine. The geometry of the ground drill shows a good agreement with the dimension of each design parameter, which validates the accuracy of the proposed modelling method and the corresponding <b>grinding</b> <b>path...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{flexible}} {{contact and}} machining with wide strip are two prominent advantages for the robotic belt grinding system, {{which can be}} widely used to improve the surface quality and machining efficiency while finishing the workpieces with sculptured surfaces. There lacks research on <b>grinding</b> <b>path</b> planning with the constraint of curvature. With complicated contact between the contact wheel and the workpiece, the grinding paths for robot {{can be obtained by}} the theory of contact kinematics. The grinding process must satisfy the universal demands of the belt grinding technologies, and {{the most important thing is}} to make the contact wheel conform to the local geometrical features on the contact area. For the local surfaces with small curvature, the curve length between the neighboring cutting locations becomes longer to ensure processing efficiency. Otherwise, for the local areas with large curvature, the curve length becomes shorter to ensure machining accuracy. A series of planes are created to intersect with the target surface to be ground, and the corresponding sectional profile curves are obtained. For each curve, the curve length between the neighboring cutting points is optimized by inserting a cutter location at the local area with large curvatures. A method of generating the grinding paths including curve length spacing optimization is set up. The validity is completely approved by the off-line simulation, and during the grinding experiments with the method, the quality of surface is improved. The path planning method provides a theoretical support for the smooth and accuracy path of robotic surface grinding...|$|E

More specifically, the efficiency in terms of the approach and retract time was improved up to 40 %, and an improvement of approximately 10. 6 % in the overall machining time can be achieved. Research limitations/implications: In fact, the used tool database in this study only includes some specific tools such as the square end mill. The step drill, taper tools, and special tools can also be taken into account in the database for future research.

For fillet end-mill, because of its complexity geometry in flank and fillet parts, a free-form geometry model is needed for further analysis and optimization. Many research works have been conducted on building geometric model based on <b>grinding</b> tool <b>path.</b> In this thesis, a parametric and easy controlled method is proposed for design and modeling of the fillet flank and the fillet rake surface. First, the end and side clearance surface need to be established according to geometric parameters and constraints; Secondly, the fillet cutting edge is designed to achieve the machining requirement of the corner radius geometry, which is critical for the modeling of the fillet flank and the fillet rake surface face; Then, the surface of the fillet flank is supported by splines which derived from the customized two-dimensional corner. And a rake angle based method is applied for modeling of the fillet rake surface. A detailed discussion on parametric variables of this method is provided for a more accurate surface. Together with flutes and gashes, the solid model of the fillet end-mill can be modeled using Boolean operations.

40|$|Conference Name: 5 th International Symposium on Advanced Optical Manufacturing and Testing Technologies - Advanced Optical Manufacturing Technologies. Conference Address: Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA. Time:APR 26 - 29, 2010. The {{ultrasonic}} vibration-assisted machining (UVAM) {{technology is}} increasingly attractive for the ultraprecision machining of brittle materials. But the machining mechanism for UVAM is still unknown, {{especially for the}} grinding process. In this paper, the kinematical characteristics of two-dimensional vertical ultrasonic vibration-assisted grinding (UVAG) technology are investigated. A consistent physical modeling of the grinding process with ultrasonic vibration assistance is established firstly, {{which is based on}} the interaction of individual grinding grains with the workpiece. Then the kinematical equation is deduced, and so does the velocity and acceleration of a single abrasive grit relative to the workpiece in UVAG. The kinematics of a single abrasive grit during 2 D UVAG is simulated for the perpendicular vibration mode. The results show that the relation motion of an abrasive grit is altered significantly with the assistance of ultrasonic vibration, and the <b>grinding</b> <b>path</b> is elongated, which will increase the material removal rate per abrasive grit. The most interesting result is that the relative velocity of an abrasive grit in UVAG is changed slightly when compared to that without ultrasonication. While the relative acceleration in UVAG is increasing tremendously, especially for high frequency ratio (a ratio between the vibration frequency to the rotation frequency) condition. This result means that the ultrasonic vibration assistance can introduce a huge acceleration impact on the material in the machining deformation zone by the grinding grit, and may change the material removal mechanism of grinding. Thus it can do a favor to the precision machining of brittle materials. The UVAG experiment of polysilicon shows that the surface roughness is improved and the normal and tangential grinding forces decrease with the increasing of applied voltage, while the axial grinding force increases. The results indicate that the assistance of ultrasonic vibration can result the change of the grinding mechanism of brittle material...|$|E

In {{the process}} of the ultra-precision <b>grinding,</b> the {{machining}} <b>path</b> of the aspherical is the result of motor coordination by several axes for the numerical control system. Since the motion of each axis have errors, there are big errors between the real positions and the theoretical positions, and the position error of the wheel infects the accuracy of the workpiece greatly. This paper analyses the position error property of the wheel and finds the machining approach path {{has nothing to do with}} the position error, just do with to the present machining point. In order to solve the problem, the method using the Neural Network optimized by the Genetic Algorithm to establish the position error model is introduced. A three-layer error back propagation (simplified as BP) Neural Network is used to establish the position error model, the position coordinates (x, z) of the program instruction is input layer, and the corroding measured error value (x ∆, ∆ z) is output layer.
