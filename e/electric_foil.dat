5000|$|The <b>electric</b> <b>foil</b> {{contains}} a socket underneath the guard that {{connects to the}} scoring apparatus via the body cord and a wire that runs down a channel cut {{into the top of}} the blade. <b>Electric</b> <b>foil</b> sockets are fixed so that the body cord plugs into the weapon at the fencer's wrist. There are two main varieties of socket in use today: the two-prong variety which has unequal diameter prongs and is held in place by a retaining clip, and the single-prong [...] "bayonette" [...] which twist-locks into place.|$|E
5000|$|The {{tip of the}} <b>electric</b> <b>foil</b> terminates in {{a button}} {{assembly}} that generally consists of a barrel, plunger, spring, and retaining screws. The circuit is a [...] "normally closed" [...] one, meaning that at rest {{there is always a}} complete power circuit; depressing the tip breaks this circuit, and the scoring apparatus illuminates an appropriate light. Color-coding is used: white or yellow indicates hits not on the valid target area, and either red or green indicate hits on the valid target area (red for one fencer, green for the other).|$|E
5000|$|... "Electric" [...] fencing has {{not been}} without its problems. One of the most talked about has been the {{registration}} of glancing hits in foil. Traditionally, a valid, [...] "palpable" [...] hit could only be scored, if the point were fixed on the target in such a manner, as {{would be likely to}} pierce the skin, had the weapon been sharp. However, the <b>electric</b> <b>foil</b> point (the push-button {{on the end of the}} blade) lacks directionality, so hits which arrive at a very high angle of incidence can still register. In the 1980s, this led to a growing popularity of hits delivered with a whip-like action (commonly known as [...] "the flick"), bending the blade around the opponent's parry. Many saw this as an unacceptable deviation from tradition. In fact, the disputes over the flick grew so bitter that a number of traditionalists advocated (and still continue to advocate) complete abandonment of electronic scoring as something detrimental to fencing as an art. In 2004-2005 the FIE brought in rule changes to address such concerns. The dwell time (the length of time the point has to remain depressed in order to register a hit) was increased from 1 millisecond to 15 milliseconds. This change has been rather controversial. While it has not eliminated the flick altogether, it has made it technically trickier thereby denting its popularity. However, there have been some serious problems with apparently [...] "palpable" [...] hits not registering. Moreover, the imperative to make clear [...] "square-on" [...] hits has led to a number of unforeseen results, which, it has been argued, have made foil less rather than more classical. The following have been reported: ...|$|E

The basic concept of magnet protection and technical solutions are briefly presented.

40|$|Piezoceramic patch sensors have to {{withstand}} the primary stresses and strains of a structure during operation. In the leading project Adaptronics a lifespan of 106 cycles at 0. 1 % strain was required for sensors applied on components of steel and carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP). In order to test {{the reliability of the}} patches themselves and of their adhesion on the substrate, special four-point bending tests were carried out under quasistatic loading and under cyclic loading at different strain levels. The specimens consisted in sheets of steel and CFRP as substrates on which the newly developed patches with embedded piezo <b>electric</b> <b>foils</b> and fibres were glued (Fig. 4). In the quasistatic bending tests the performance of each sensor was characterised by measuring the sensor signal (charge) as a function of strain before and after cycling. Damage of the specimens would result in a decreasing slope of the charge-strain-curve after cycling. However, all the specimens tested survived 107 cycles up to 0. 12 % strain without marked loss of performance...|$|R

These panels are based on the phase change materials (PCM) for normal inner environment temperature in buildings. The energy for the thermal energy storage is possible to get from built-in <b>electric</b> heating <b>foil</b> or from the tube heat exchanger, which is build in the thermal panels. This technology is able to use renewable energy sources, for example, solar thermal collectors and air-to-water heat pump as a source of heat for heating of the hot water tank.

40|$|We have {{measured}} the linear polarization of the Hβ transition at 486. 1 nm excited by {{passage of a}} 110 keV proton beam through perpendicular carbon foils. We have observed that the polarization depends upon the beam intensity and on the relative position of the foil and its holder. We have shown that these dependences {{are linked to the}} presence of a stray electric field at the immediate vicinity of the foil. The field is due to the potential distribution at the foil surface resulting from the electron radial flow in the high <b>foil</b> <b>electric</b> resistance (about 50 kΩ). It introduces a perturbation which in our case {{is more important than the}} temperature effect observed by Gay and Berry (Phys. Rev. A 19, 952 (1979)).

40|$|The {{present study}} {{focuses on the}} {{high-resolution}} determination of local heat flux distributions encountered in forced convection heat transfer studies. The specific method results in an uncertainty level less than 4 percent of the heat transfer coeffi-cient on surfaces with arbitrarily defined geometric boundaries. Heat transfer sur-faces constructed for use in steady-state chniques typically use rectangular thin <b>foil</b> <b>electric</b> heaters to generate a constant heat flux boundary condition. There are also past studies dealing with geometrically complex heating elements. Past studies have either omitted the nonuniform heat flux regions or applied correctional techniques that are approximate. The current study combines electric field theory and a finite element method to solve directly for a nonun~orm surface heat flux distribution due to the specific shape of the heater boundary. Heat generation per unit volume of the surface heater element in the Jbrm of local Joule heating is accurately calculated using a finite element technique. The technique is shown to be applicable to many complex convective heat transfer configurations. These configurations often have complex geometric boundaries such as turbine endwall platforms, surfaces disturbe...|$|R

40|$|In the Windtunnel for Straight Cascades (EGG) at DLR, Goettingen, {{thermodynamic}} investigations {{were performed}} applying an improved cooling scheme to establish film cooling at the endwall {{of a first}} stage stator. Based on the results from an earlier project the slot position {{in front of the}} cascade, as well as the number and the arrangement of the cooling holes within the passage were improved to reduce the necessary amount of coolant. The experiments were carried out at an exit Mach number of 1. 0 and at a downstream Reynolds number of 850, 000. An infrared camera was used to collect the thermal data of the homogeneous heated endwall, which was appended with <b>electric</b> operated heating <b>foils.</b> The temperature of the coolant flow was adjustable which was necessary {{for the use of the}} superposition method. Therefore, the values for heat transfer coefficients and film cooling effectiveness were obtained under similar boundary conditions. The experiments proved the progress in coolant management achieved when applying the new improved cooling configuration instead of the previous one. The slot coolant mass flow rate was more than halved without reducing the film cooling effectiveness.
