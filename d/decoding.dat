5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{has led to}} codon assignments of {{the genetic}} code that minimize the effects of mutations. A recent hypothesis suggests that the triplet code was derived from codes that used longer than triplet codons (such as quadruplet codons). Longer than triplet <b>decoding</b> would increase codon redundancy and would be more error resistant. This feature could allow accurate <b>decoding</b> absent complex translational machinery such as the ribosome, such as before cells began making ribosomes.|$|E
5|$|Because {{there are}} 26 letters (2×13) {{in the basic}} Latin alphabet, ROT13 is its own inverse; that is, to undo ROT13, the same {{algorithm}} is applied, so the same action {{can be used for}} encoding and <b>decoding.</b> The algorithm provides virtually no cryptographic security, and is often cited as a canonical example of weak encryption.|$|E

25|$|The <b>decoding</b> process reverses these steps, {{except the}} {{quantization}} {{because it is}} irreversible. In {{the remainder of this}} section, the encoding and <b>decoding</b> processes are described in more detail.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the <b>decoding</b> stage a child will often be devoting so much mental capacity to the process of <b>decoding</b> that they will have no comprehension of the meaning of the words being read. This is most likely if the text being read is at or above their skill level. It is nevertheless an important stage. Such <b>decoding</b> practice allows the child to improve their <b>decoding</b> skills with the ultimate goal of becoming automatic as it is for most skilled readers with most text they encounter. Like every skill, the more you do it the better you get. Though comprehension may be poor at this stage, it is nevertheless an important step towards comprehension. As the skill of <b>decoding</b> improves and the more automatic it becomes the more the child has mental capacity to devote to comprehension. Therefore, understanding of what is being read increases.|$|E
50|$|Fetching {{complete}} pre-decoded instructions {{eliminates the}} need to repeatedly <b>decode</b> variable length complex instructions into simpler fixed-length micro-operations, and simplifies the process of predicting, fetching, rotating and aligning fetched instructions. A uop cache effectively offloads the fetch and <b>decode</b> hardware, thus decreasing power consumption and improving the frontend supply of <b>decoded</b> micro-operations. The uop cache also increases performance by more consistently delivering <b>decoded</b> micro-operations to the backend and eliminating various bottlenecks in the CPU's fetch and <b>decode</b> logic.|$|R

50|$|A micro-operation cache (uop cache, μop cache or UC) is a {{specialized}} cache that stores micro-operations of <b>decoded</b> instructions, as received {{directly from the}} instruction decoders or from the instruction cache. When an instruction needs to be <b>decoded,</b> the uop cache is checked for its <b>decoded</b> form which is re-used if cached; {{if it is not}} available, the instruction is <b>decoded</b> and then cached.|$|R
5000|$|Note, however, {{addresses}} in [...] for , , etc., are {{two or more}} bytes, {{compared to}} one byte, typically, for the <b>decode</b> and dispatch interpreter described above. In general, instructions for a <b>decode</b> and dispatch interpreter may be any size. For example, a <b>decode</b> and dispatch interpreter to simulate an Intel Pentium <b>decodes</b> instructions that range from 1 to 16 bytes. However, bytecoded systems typically choose 1-byte codes for the most-common operations. Thus, the thread often has a higher space cost than bytecodes. In most uses, the reduction in <b>decode</b> cost outweighs the increase in space cost.|$|R
