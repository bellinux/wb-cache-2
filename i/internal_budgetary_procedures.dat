40|$|This paper reviews current {{discussions on}} {{reforming}} the European Union (EU) <b>budgetary</b> <b>procedure</b> and assesses the main reform proposals {{that have been}} suggested thus far. It argues that prospects for reforms are presently hampered by the complex interplay between supranational and intergovernmental decision modes and the requirement of any <b>budgetary</b> <b>procedure</b> {{to strike a balance}} between efficiency and legitimacy. The paper reviews the main criticisms of the present <b>budgetary</b> <b>procedure</b> and the related reform proposals, which are assessed on the basis of relevant theoretical literature as well as brief comparisons with the federal budget of the United States. The paper argues that the current EU <b>budgetary</b> <b>procedure</b> matches by-and-large the current equilibrium between all actors involved, given the present state of political integration in the EU. Significant modifications to the <b>budgetary</b> <b>procedure</b> would depart from that equilibrium. European Union, EU budget, budget process...|$|R
40|$|The Treaty of Lisbon {{reformed}} the <b>budgetary</b> <b>procedure</b> of the European Union (EU). This paper {{describes the}} key changes and presents a game-theoretical {{analysis of the}} annual <b>budgetary</b> <b>procedure.</b> Our {{focus is on the}} implications of these changes for the budgetary powers of the European Parliament (EP). Against the common belief that the budgetary powers of the EP were strengthened {{as a result of the}} Lisbon Treaty, our analysis paints a somewhat more sober assessment of its budgetary empowerment as a result of the reform. We find that the <b>budgetary</b> <b>procedure</b> operates much like the codecision procedure does in the legislative process. Compared to the <b>budgetary</b> <b>procedure</b> used prior to the Lisbon Treaty, it has become more difficult for the Parliament to pass amendments, if it wants to affect what used to be referred to as non-compulsory spending or decrease compulsory spending. The EP’s ability to pass amendments that increase compulsory spending is mostly unaffected. The configuration of preferences and bargaining powers in the Conciliation Committee determine whether on balance the EP is better off under the new procedure. nrpages: 31 status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{widespread}} {{calls for}} {{reforms of the}} EU <b>budgetary</b> <b>procedure,</b> the European Convention and, even more importantly, the Intergovernmental Conference seem to have generated only minor institutional adjustments. This paper aims to explore the lack of institutional change in the budgetary field. On {{the basis of a}} thorough analysis of the current <b>budgetary</b> <b>procedure</b> and a detailed assessment of the various reform proposals, the paper contends that an important reason for keeping the institutional status quo has been the lack of a suitable alternative. While this result is line with the existing institutional choice literature, the paper develops the theoretical argument further. It reveals that the current design of the EU <b>budgetary</b> <b>procedure</b> corresponds by-and-large to an equilibrium between all actors involved, given the present state of political integration in the European Union. Altering that equilibrium would require a significant shift in integration. The “embeddedness ” of the budgetary field in the overall state of European integration thus constrains the scope of reform significantly. Given that neither the European Convention nor IGC have dwelled on questions related to the general state of political integration, {{it is not surprising that}} the calls for far-reaching reforms of the EU <b>budgetary</b> <b>procedure</b> did not amount to the desired institutional change. 1 The opinions expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the European Central Bank.

40|$|In this {{working paper}} we analyse the {{relationship}} between budgetary institutions {{and the performance of}} public finances in ten of the twelve countries that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 (Cyprus and Malta excluded). We review the latest contributions in the literature on institutional aspects of fiscal policy, and highlight different economic and political factors that explain why fiscal policies in general and fiscal adjustments in particular vary between countries and along time. The paper inquires into the economic, political, and institutional determinants of these differences, paying special attention to the role played by <b>budgetary</b> <b>procedures.</b> Based on the quantitative analysis of the above mentioned institutional factors,we present an econometric model that enables us to explain such variations.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} role of fiscal and {{monetary}} institutions in macroeconomic stability and budgetary control in central, eastern and south-eastern European countries (CESEE) in comparison with other OECD countries. CESEE countries tend to grow faster and have more volatile output than non-CESEE OECD countries, which has implications for macroeconomic management: better fiscal and monetary institutions are needed to avoid pro-cyclical policies. The paper develops a Budgetary Discipline Index to assess whether good fiscal institutions underpin good fiscal outcomes. Even though most CESEE countries have low scores, the debt/GDP ratios declined before the crisis. This was largely the consequence of a very favourable relationship between the economic growth rate and the interest rate, but such a favourable relationship is not expected in the future. Econometric estimations confirm that better monetary institutions reduce macroeconomic volatility and that countries with better <b>budgetary</b> <b>procedures</b> have better fiscal outcomes. All these factors call for improved monetary institutions, stronger fiscal rules and better <b>budgetary</b> <b>procedures</b> in CESEE countries.

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the proposed}} {{reform of the}} annual <b>budgetary</b> <b>procedure</b> of the European Union (EU) during the 2002 - 04 Convention and Intergovernmental Conference (IGC). We offer two findings. First, the European Parliament already {{has the power to}} reduce agricultural and fisheries spending subject to support from a blocking minority in the Council. Hence, a reduction of the Union's spending on agriculture and other areas of compulsory expenditure is not dependent on a reform of the <b>budgetary</b> <b>procedure.</b> Second, the proposal from the Convention would have increased EP budgetary powers while the procedure adopted by the IGC strengthens the hand of the Council, removing Parliament's right to overrule it. In constitutional bargaining, we see that Parliament gains in a deliberative forum where unanimity is not required, while it loses in a closed IGC.

40|$|MCom (Management Accountancy), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 In 2009 Operation Clean Audit was {{launched}} {{with the objective}} that all municipalities must achieve a clean audit by the 2014 financial year. A clean audit is an audit opinion when the financial statements are unqualified; no adverse findings were identified on compliance with laws and regulations {{as well as on}} predetermined objectives. The overall aim of the programme is to clean up the governance of municipalities and to enhance service delivery. In both the public and the private sector internal control is crucial. It is seen as one of the key elements of good governance, it provides assurance of the rendering of reliable financial statements, of compliance with legislation and it also indicates how the organisation performs against its objectives. Budgetary control in local government can be used as an effective internal control method by legally limiting the authorised expenditure and to monitor the actual service delivery against the budgeted targets. If variances are identified in the budget or with regard to service delivery objectives, remedial action can be taken. If municipalities do not provide services to communities in a sustainable manner, it contravenes its constitutional mandate as stipulated in section 152 (1) (b) of the Constitution of South Africa. The qualitative research method, in the format of a case study of the Tlokwe City Council, a local municipality in the North West Province, was chosen for this research. In the 2010 financial year, the Auditor General reflected that the Tlokwe City Council experienced deficiencies in the key fundamentals of internal control: leadership, financial and performance management, and governance which could directly be linked to the basis of the qualification of the financial statements, findings on predetermined objectives and compliance with legislation. The material underspending of the capital budget was also found to be affecting service delivery negatively. The {{purpose of this study is}} to benchmark the <b>internal</b> <b>budgetary</b> control systems of municipalities in South Africa, which have already achieved clean audit reports for consecutive years, to improve the <b>internal</b> <b>budgetary</b> control system of the Tlokwe City Council. This research was formulated in such a way that — through the findings obtained in the literature study with regard to the legislative framework regulating the budget formulation, <b>internal</b> and <b>budgetary</b> control of the local government sphere in South Africa, analysis of the <b>internal</b> <b>budgetary</b> control deficiencies at the Tlokwe City Council and the benchmarking exercise with the Swartland and Steve Tshwete local municipalities — a strategy can be developed to provide for effective budgeting and to improve the internal control system of the Tlokwe City Council. Potential benefits that can arise from the implementation of the recommended strategy to improve the <b>internal</b> <b>budgetary</b> control system of the Tlokwe City Council are the attainment of a clean audit opinion by the Auditor General and subsequently the enhancement of service delivery to the community.

40|$|Codecision is {{the main}} EU {{legislative}} procedure and the 2007 Reform Treaty draft has adopted it to improve the budgetary process. However, at close examination, codecision and the current budgetary process show an identical structure. Both are designed as non-cooperative alternating offers bargaining games between institutions and both, although in different measure, have gone through periods of interinstitutional deadlocks and conflicts, which can be ascribed to the insufficiency of the non-cooperative bargaining setup {{with respect to the}} task of providing for joint decision making by the Parliament and the Council of Ministers: in particular, the opportunistic interpretation of the Treaty provisions by the Parliament in the 1980 s was one of the consequences of the strict bargaining design. The lacking elements for joint decision-making have been gradually inserted in the procedures by means of informal negotiation institutions, which are not only mechanisms for equilibrium selection but also corrective devices to strict non-cooperative procedures.
