The Feed Tank was designed to simulate actual conditions in which the <b>Dip</b> <b>Tubes</b> would measure the differential pressure. The Feed Tank was made of Stainless Steel with a Lexan window to view inside the tank during testing. The Feed Tank was built per Drawing SRT-ETF-DD- 96008, Revision A.

40|$|Abstract. The <b>dipping</b> <b>tube</b> {{hydropneumatic}} tank {{is one of}} {{the most}} efficient equipments to prevent water hammer in water distribution and long distance transmission pipe systems. Due to its low costs and easy to maintain features, <b>dipping</b> <b>tube</b> hydropneumatic tank has many irreplaceable advantages, however it is difficult to determine the correct size and gas volume for real world engineering applications. This paper presents a robust method to solve the problems from theory and application. Based on the Method of Characteristics (MOC) equations, this paper derives the equations for modeling <b>dipping</b> <b>tube</b> hydropneumatic tanks in water distribution systems to prevent water hammer. The equations include MOC, differential orifice head loss equation, gas law, air mass, air velocity and etc. The IBM’s scientific subroutine package (SSP) is applied to solve the equations by deriving to the form of X=f(X). The method has been integrated into HAMMER. This paper also presents an example to illustrate the methods of determining the tank size, and the comparison results with sealed hydropneumatic tank and surge tank equipment...|$|R

50|$|Propane is {{generally}} stored and transported in steel cylinders as a liquid with a vapor space above the liquid. The vapor {{pressure in the}} cylinder {{is a function of}} temperature. When gaseous propane is drawn at a high rate, the latent heat of vaporisation required to create the gas will cause the bottle to cool. (This is why water often condenses {{on the sides of the}} bottle and then freezes). In addition, the lightweight, high-octane compounds vaporize before the heavier, low-octane ones. Thus, the ignition properties change as the cylinder empties. For these reasons, the liquid is often withdrawn using a <b>dip</b> <b>tube.</b> Propane is used as fuel in furnaces for heat, in cooking, as an energy source for water heaters, laundry dryers, barbecues, portable stoves, and motor vehicles.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} in which the stirrer speed was varied during a methanol synthesis run with BASF S 3 - 86 catalyst showed that mass transfer limitations were present at 750 psig reactor pressure and at space velocities of 5000 and 10000 sl/kg(cat.) -hr [...] There was no effect of stirrer speed on reaction rate at 2500 psig reactor pressure and 16500 sl/kg(cat.) -hr. space velocity. However, this was probably due to a close approach to equilibrium {{rather than to the}} lack of a mass transfer effect. The most plausible explanation for the presence of a mass transfer influence is the position of the gas feed <b>dip</b> <b>tube</b> relative to the agitator impeller. A second set of stirrer speed experiments using the same catalyst showed that feeding into the reactor headspace produced much lower reaction rates, compared with gas feed through a <b>dip</b> <b>tube.</b> The headspace feed also showed a strong dependence on stirrer speed, consistent with the <b>dip</b> <b>tube</b> feed results.

Three stirred autoclave runs with a commercial, high-pressure methanol synthesis catalyst (zinc chromite) slurried in decahydronaphthalene ended son after the initial catalyst reduction due to failures of the liquid return pump in the overhead system.

30|$|Sep-Pak {{purification}} cartridges (Sep-Pak), e.g., silica, C 18, etc., {{are connected}} to designated Luer fittings on the cassette. A <b>dip</b> <b>tube</b> (e.g., made of Teflon® tubing with an outside diameter (OD) of 1 / 8 in.) {{is built into the}} cassette to act as the fluid path for the transfer of crude products. Tubing with an OD of 1 / 8 in. is necessary when transferring synthesis products that produce precipitates, but 1 / 16 in. tubing may be installed for smaller volume transfers. The transfer unit operation begins with the reaction vessel sealing against the transfer position on the cassette (Figures  4 and 5). The gas supplier provides inert gas to pressurize the reaction vessel. This moves the fluid through the <b>dip</b> <b>tube</b> and to the Sep-Pak. After the Sep-Pak, a dedicated stopcock valve in the cassette switches between a fluid path towards a waste collection vial installed on the cassette and a tube that can be plumbed to the input of the next cassette. Often, {{the first step is to}} trap the crude product onto the Sep-Pak and allow the residual solution to collect in the waste container. The stopcock position is switched, and elution of the desired product into the next reaction vessel is then performed by adding the elution solvent to the first reaction vessel and repeating the transfer unit operation to elute the product from the Sep-Pak.|$|E

In order to explain these observational features, we performed one-dimensional radiative hydrodynamic simulations of filament formation along a <b>dipped</b> magnetic flux <b>tube</b> {{in the framework}} of the chromospheric evaporation-coronal condensation model. The geometry of a <b>dipped</b> magnetic flux <b>tube</b> is characterized by three parameters, i. e., the depth (D), the half-width (w), and the altitude (h) of the magnetic dip. The parameter survey in the numerical simulations shows that allowing the filament thread to grow in 5 days, the maximum length (L_th) of the filament thread increases linearly with w, and decreases linearly with D and h. The dependence is fitted into a linear function L_th= 0. 84 w- 0. 88 D- 2. 78 h+ 17. 31 Mm.

40|$|We have {{developed}} the first self-consistent model for the observed large-amplitude oscillations along filament axes that explains the restoring force and damping mechanism. We have investigated the oscillations of multiple threads formed in long, <b>dipped</b> flux <b>tubes</b> through the thermal nonequilibrium process, {{and found that the}} oscillation properties predicted by our simulations agree with the observed behavior. We then constructed a model for the large-amplitude longitudinal oscillations that demonstrates that the restoring force is the projected gravity in the tube where the threads oscillate. Although the period is independent of the tube length and the constantly growing mass, the motions are strongly damped by the steady accretion of mass onto the threads by thermal nonequilibrium. The observations and our model suggest that a nearby impulsive event drives the existing prominence threads along their supporting tubes, away from the heating deposition site, without destroying them. The subsequent oscillations occur because the displaced threads reside in magnetic concavities with large radii of curvature. Our model yields a powerful seismological method for constraining the coronal magnetic field and radius of curvature of dips. Furthermore, these results indicate that the magnetic structure is most consistent with the sheared-arcade model for filament channels. Comment: ApJ in pres...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{recorded}} observation of capillary action was by Leonardo da Vinci. [...] A former student of Galileo, , {{was said to}} have investigated capillary action. [...] In 1660, capillary action was still a novelty to the Irish chemist Robert Boyle, when he reported that [...] "some inquisitive French Men" [...] had observed that when a capillary <b>tube</b> was <b>dipped</b> into water, the water would ascend to [...] "some height in the Pipe". Boyle then reported an experiment in which he <b>dipped</b> a capillary <b>tube</b> into red wine and then subjected the tube to a partial vacuum. He found that the vacuum had no observable influence on the height of the liquid in the capillary, so the behavior of liquids in capillary tubes was due to some phenomenon different from that which governed mercury barometers.|$|R
