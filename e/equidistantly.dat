5|$|Four pilosity {{patterns}} (patterns of hair-like setae) {{are known}} to occur within Tatuidris collections. Pilosity pattern A consists of a mix of both long flexuous and short appressed setae. This {{is the most common}} pilosity pattern and the one that most resembles the type specimens from El Salvador and the gyne from Otongachi, Ecuador. Pilosity pattern B is characterized by very short, fully appressed, and regular spaced setae arrayed homogeneously and <b>equidistantly</b> on the head, mesosoma, petiole, postpetiole and gaster. Pilosity pattern C is characterized by dense lanose-looking setae. Pilosity pattern D consists of short and uniform decumbent (strongly inclined but not fully appressed) setae scattered throughout the body.|$|E
25|$|In 1960, the River Ogmore burst {{its banks}} and flooded the town centre. Subsequent floods and extreme weather led the Welsh Water Authority to develop {{concrete}} flood defence walls {{along the banks}} of the River Ogmore in the town centre. The town centre has not been flooded since. During this time, Bridgend was chosen to become the headquarters for South Wales Police. This action was ideal as geographically, Bridgend stands <b>equidistantly</b> between Swansea to the west and Cardiff to the east.|$|E
25|$|Each granite {{pedestal}} is hollow, {{and open}} to the bare earth inside. The statues were originally anchored to their pedestals by a steel framework covered in bitumen. Each pedestal has 36 gilded bronze stars spaced <b>equidistantly</b> at the top, which represent the number of states in the United States {{at the time of the}} American Civil War. At the front of each pedestal is a classical wreath, designed and carved by Vincent Tonelli (who also co-carved the Trylon of Freedom in front of the E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse). Art curator Susan Menconi said in 1990 that The Arts of War and The Arts of Peace were the largest equestrian sculptures in the United States.|$|E

500|$|Plymouth {{makes up}} the entire western shore of Cape Cod Bay. It is bordered on land by Bourne to the southeast, Wareham to the southwest, Carver to the west, and Kingston to the north. It also shares a small border with Duxbury at the land {{entrance}} of Saquish Neck. Plymouth's border with Bourne makes {{up most of the}} line between Plymouth and Barnstable counties. The town is located roughly [...] southeast of Boston (it is almost exactly [...] from Plymouth Rock to the Massachusetts State House) and <b>equidistantly</b> east of Providence, Rhode Island.|$|E
500|$|According to one [...] {{taught to}} {{students}} during freshman orientation, the statue was originally {{to be positioned}} with Will Rogers facing due west, so it would appear he was riding into the sunset. However, that position would cause Soapsuds' posterior end to face due east, a dubious greeting to visitors entering by the main eastern campus entrance where the statue is placed. The horse's rear would also be facing downtown Lubbock, potentially insulting the Lubbock business community. The legend holds that this problem was solved by Tech's Civil Engineering department, who calculated that a 23° turn of Soapsuds' head to the north would line up Soapsuds' rear end directly toward College Station, Texas, home of the rival Texas A Aggies. Modern surveys and satellite imagery have determined the statue's posterior end actually points roughly <b>equidistantly</b> between College Station and Austin, home of another rival team, the Texas Longhorns.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} {{moved to}} the United Kingdom and shot in a converted airship hangar in Cardington, Bedfordshire, north of London. There, the hotel bar set which tilted 30 degrees was built. A hotel corridor was also constructed by Guy Hendrix Dyas, the production designer, Chris Corbould, the special effects supervisor, and Wally Pfister, the director of photography; it rotated a full 360degrees to create the effect of alternate directions of gravity for scenes set during the second level of dreaming, where dream-sector physics become chaotic. The idea {{was inspired by a}} technique used in Stanley Kubrick's [...] (1968). Nolan said, [...] "I was interested in taking those ideas, techniques, and philosophies and applying them to an action scenario". The filmmakers originally planned to make the hallway only 40ft (12m) long, but as the action sequence became more elaborate, the hallway's length grew to 100ft (30m). The corridor was suspended along eight large concentric rings that were spaced <b>equidistantly</b> outside its walls and powered by two massive electric motors. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who plays Arthur, spent several weeks learning to fight in a corridor that spun like [...] "a giant hamster wheel". Nolan said of the device, [...] "It was like some incredible torture device; we thrashed Joseph for weeks, but in the end we looked at the footage, and it looks unlike anything any of us has seen before. The rhythm of it is unique, and when you watch it, even if you know how it was done, it confuses your perceptions. It's unsettling in a wonderful way". Gordon-Levitt remembered, [...] "it was six-day weeks of just, like, coming home at night battered ... The light fixtures on the ceiling are coming around on the floor, and you have to choose the right time to cross through them, and if you don't, you're going to fall." [...] On July15,2009, filming took place at University College London for the sequences occurring inside a Paris college of architecture in the story, including the library, Flaxman Gallery and Gustav Tuck Theatre.|$|E
2500|$|Some Pegasus Stargates {{are placed}} in orbit around a planet (sometimes called [...] "Spacegates" [...] in the show) rather than on its surface, {{something}} {{that has never been}} seen in the Milky Way. Ships such as the Ancient puddle jumper and the Wraith dart are designed to fit through Stargates, and have built-in DHDs. Orbital Stargates are kept in place by the three station-keeping thrusters placed <b>equidistantly</b> around the circumference. As seen in the Atlantis season 5 episode [...] "Ghost in the Machine", they will correct for sudden impacts to the gate, such as being hit by a Puddle Jumper.|$|E
2500|$|The {{species is}} {{distinguished}} by a stout mesosoma {{that is about}} 30% {{as high as it}} is long. [...] The species is noted for having the largest size variation between individual workers, with the body lengths of the three type specimens raging between [...] [...] The size variation is an almost 40% difference between the smallest worker specimens and the largest. [...] The head is blocky, having rounded edges, an overall square shape, and a flattened area between and behind the two compound eyes. [...] There are rounded rectangular carinae surrounding each of the oval eyes, and the ocelli are placed <b>equidistantly</b> from each other on the flat area of the head. [...] There are scattered short setae on both gena and the clypeus. [...] The lower margin of the clypeus has 20 denticles and a row of eight to ten longer setae that point toward the mandibles. [...] The mesosoma is smooth with little sculpturing other than the protruding spiracles and the deep distinct metanotal groove. Gasteral segment 1 has a distinct forward pointed hook like projection on the underside, while gasteral segment 4 has a fringe of setae along the back edge. [...] Given the thick body of the species, the name robustus, from the Latin for [...] "strong", was chosen.|$|E
2500|$|A {{controversy}} surrounding Perpessicius' contributions as chronicler and theorist emerged during his lifetime, centered on perceptions {{that he was}} neither polemically engaged nor a proponent of hierarchies, but that he preferred to write <b>equidistantly.</b> Contrary to his contemporaries, Perpessicius believed {{the work of a}} critic to be not the imposition of a direction, but the [...] "registry office" [...] and panorama of naturally occurring trends, an idea notably present in the title of his article În tinda unei registraturi ("In the Parlor of a Registry Office"). The text spoke in favor of diversity and against [...] "sectarianism": [...] "I shall weed out [...] any sectarian prejudice and shall strive to comment on any work", because [...] "the critic would do better not to consider novelty a scarecrow." [...] Elsewhere, he cited Thibaudet for having inspired in him [...] "great comprehension" [...] and the ideal of [...] "plurality in tastes". In a 1962 interview with Luceafărul, Perpessicius stated: [...] "young writers [...] should have the habit of reading the critics, but should not obey their assessments blindly. Just as there are writers who request any verdict, no matter how severe, {{as long as it is}} sincere, there are those pompous critics, who have never doubted the justness of their verdicts. Our experience from both sides of the barricade has taught us that both are wrong. Albeit mediocre, the middle way is the golden way." ...|$|E

50|$|As can be {{seen from}} the {{definition}} of the divided differences new data points can be added to the data set to create a new interpolation polynomial without recalculating the old coefficients. And when a data point changes we usually do not have to recalculate all coefficients. Furthermore if the xi are distributed <b>equidistantly</b> the calculation of the divided differences becomes significantly easier. Therefore the divided-difference formulas are usually preferred over the Lagrange form for practical purposes.|$|E
