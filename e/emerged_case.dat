40|$|Sedimentation {{is one of}} the {{consequences}} of hydropower plant construction. Such structures not only have an influence on reservoir morphology, but also have great impact on both upstream and downstream river morphology. This study focuses on fluvial morphological changes in between two hydropower plants on the Drava River, Austria. The influence of both reservoir management methods (flushing) and human intervention (groynes) have been investigated. The first stage started with validating an unsteady Delft 3 D morphodynamic model of the meandering reach. This validation shows the importance of spatial grain size distribution in predicting bed load transport. Analysis of the flushing method includes investigation of the duration of gate-opening before and after peak flood. The results show that the duration of lowering the water level at the hydropower plant (by opening the gate) before starting the peak flood will not have a big influence on the river morphology upstream of the reservoir. However, the duration of maintaining the low water level after the peak flood has a large influence on both the river morphology in the upstream portion of the reservoir and on the sediment transport toward the reservoir In the second part of this study, hydraulic structural groynes were applied in the river reach. The objective was to design a groyne field that will minimize sediment transport to the reservoir. Both emerged and submerged groynes were investigated. In addition, the influences of both groyne head shape and the distribution of sediment grain size in the groyne zone were examined. This study shows that under an unsteady simulation, when the groynes are submerged by 1 m at normal flow, the sediment supply to the groyne zone decreases compared to the <b>emerged</b> <b>case.</b> However, if the groynes are submerged by 0. 5 m, the sediment supply to the groyne zone will be greater than the <b>emerged</b> <b>case</b> for an aspect ratio in between (0. 5 - 2). Finally, applying L-head groynes produces less erosion in the main stream and a higher sediment supply compared to straight groynes...|$|E
40|$|Groynes are dam-like {{structures}} in a river, which are constructed {{at an angle}} to the direction of the flow. Their purpose is to maintain the navigable depth during low water conditions and to divert the flow from critical zones during high water conditions. The spaces between the groynes, the groyne fields, are areas of shallow flow. Groynes have an impact of the hydrodynamic and morphologic conditions of the river. They cause specific turbulent {{structures in}} the groyne field. The morphological impact of groynes are bed level changes, such as scour holes near the groyne tips and deposition ridges in the groyne field. In flume experiments, which have been carried out at the Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics at the TU Delft, these flow conditions and bed level changes were studied for various test cases. In this thesis a numerical simulation of an <b>emerged</b> <b>case</b> of the laboratory experiment is performed. Here, the exchange processes between the main channel and the groyne field are of special interest. The simulation was done using the Delft 3 D-FLOW system. The add-on Horizontal Large Eddy Simulation (HLES) models the small-scale turbulences on a sub-grid scale. For the morphological computations the module Online-sediment was used, which calculates the sediment concentration, the sediment transport, and the bed level changes simultaneously with the flow. The model was calibrated against data from the experiment. The results of the hydrodynamic computations show the typical turbulent structures in emerged groyne fields, that have also been observed in previous experiments and described by several authors. However, a comparison with the experimental results could only be made at the locations, where the velocity was measured. With a sensitivity analysis, the influence of some input parameters on the computed flow field was studied. For this analysis some physical parameters were modified and the influence of the use of a high-pass filter for the velocity signals was investigated. The results of the morphological computation showed a qualitative accordance with the measured bed levels. Yet, the suspended sand settles too quickly at the entrance of the groyne field instead of entering it. Furthermore, the scour holes are less pronounced than in the experiment, while the erosion of the main channel is computed to be stronger than in the experiment. Another sensitivity analysis was carried out for the morphological computations. In conclusion, it can be stated, that Delft 3 D-FLOW computes the morphological pattern qualitatively well. When analysing the details, though, some major differences with the observations occur. Especially the sediment transport into the groyne field is not reproduced realistically at the moment.

The Guard-Stage-Milestone (GSM) model is a recent case management approach that substantially influences OMG’s <b>emerging</b> <b>Case</b> Man-agement Modeling Notation standard. We study the problem of outsourcing part of a GSM schema to another party, and develop a framework that supports split-ting and outsourcing of GSM schemas. One element of the framework focuses on restructuring the GSM schema to facilitate outsourcing while preserving the semantics of the original schema; the second focuses on locking protocols that define how the distributed parties should operate. Additionally, the framework allows parties to keep local parts of their GSM subschema private without affect-ing the outcomes of the global execution. The rules restructuring developed here enables a crisp separation of concerns, which allows reuse of existing GSM (and thus Case Management) engines for executing the subschemas. ...|$|R
