40|$|In {{this thesis}} a {{mathematical}} model is developed in order to describe {{the dynamics of the}} variable geometric volume swash plate axial piston pumps with the conical cylinder blocks and the integrated control unit. Using the validated model, an analytical study was conducted in order to investigate the effect of the port plate configuration on pump performance. Simulation of the change in the cylinder pressure and pump flow rate, in a systematic sequential procedure, led to an improved geometry for the suction and delivery silencing grooves on the valve plate. Cavitaion in the cylinder and pump noise were also reduced with the improved geometry. Force and vibration analysis of the pumping mechanism were carried out. This analysis presents some design recommendations regarding the moments acting on the swash plate, dynamic loads acting on the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>bearings</b> and the advantages and the limitations of using the conical arrangement of the pistons. Pump performance is simulated using a conventional PD controller with double negative feedback loop to control the swash plate swiveling angle, as currently used in practical applications. An introductory study of implementing other control schemes is conducted. A fuzzy controller is proposed to replace the PD controller in a double feedback control loop in order to improve the robustness of the control action. A single feedback control loop is proposed to replace the double control loop in order to suppress the steady state vibration of the swash plate. The control schemes were prototyped using specially developed real-time control techniques on a personal computer. The experimental setup is also used to verify the analytical findings of the pump performance with the newly proposed control schemes...|$|R

50|$|In 1999, a new twin {{converter}} transmission, the L 620 reU2, {{was developed}} for high-performance, main-line locomotives. The new L 620 reU2 was equipped with both a start-up converter, having a diameter of 525 mm, {{as well as a}} travel-phase converter, having a diameter of 434 mm. The design of the new L 620 re U2 was based on its successful predecessor, the L 520 rzU2 which had a power rating of 1,400 kW. This new transmission however was rated significantly higher at 2,700 kW and therefore virtually all of its components had to be enlarged as well as reinforced. In the standard version of the transmission, two gears were mounted on the secondary shaft rather than using the idler wheel found in the older L 520 rzU2. As a result, the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft's</b> output speed could be adjusted to suit the locomotive's power requirements. The <b>drive</b> <b>shaft's</b> main <b>bearing</b> was also enlarged to 550 mm. In general, this new high-performance transmission clearly illustrated the enormous capability of hydrodynamic couplings. With a weight-to-power ratio of only 2.06 kg/kW, the new L 620 reU2 set a record for locomotive transmissions. By comparison, the similar L 520 rzU2 transmission had a far higher weight-to-power ratio of 2.4 kg/kW. In addition, a newly designed hydrodynamic retarder, the KB 385, was available as an optional component. At Vossloh, the locomotive manufacturer based in Kiel, these transmissions were installed in both its G1700 and G2000 main-line locomotives. Finally, the latest development is the LS 640 reU2 transmission which will be used {{for the first time in}} the Voith Maxima locomotive having 3,600 kW. The LS 640 reU2 is a so-called split turbo-transmission which uses two <b>drive</b> <b>shafts</b> from the L 620 reU2 to power both bogies of a six axle diesel locomotive.|$|R

40|$|In direct {{mechanical}} drive system, coupling of various driven elements is required. Majority of drive elements like gear reducers, lead screws {{and host of}} other components are <b>driven</b> by <b>shaft</b> that is supported by multiple bearings. Due to rigidity of coupling, slight misalignments will be there between a driving and <b>driven</b> <b>shaft.</b> The function of power transmission coupling is transmitting torque from driving <b>shaft</b> to <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> along with shaft misalignment. Misalignment in shaft may results into unwanted strains on <b>shaft</b> <b>bearings</b> causing to wear out. Few conventional solutions are available for misalignment problems like Oldham’s coupling and universal joint which have several limitations. These limitations can be overcome with Thompson constant velocity (CV) coupling which offers features like minimizing side loads, higher misalignment capabilities, more operating speeds, improved efficiency of transmission and many more.

It was powered by the same TRX 2.5 nitro engine as the Nitro Rustler but had many new high tech features, some borrowed from the Revo, that set it apart. One of the new features was a sophisticated 2-speed automatic transmission, that improved acceleration and top speed over the single speed Nitro Rustler. A new suspension design was another new feature. It included new [...] "GTR" [...] shocks and springs, which were borrowed from the Revo, but used in a traditional configuration instead of the Revo's push-rod configuration. The suspension also included front and rear mounting points for optional sway bars, which were offered as Traxxas accessories in three different thicknesses.
