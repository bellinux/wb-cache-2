Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 54 - 62). Today, {{one of the}} biggest problem which the world have to get over is the global warming and the main reason of global warming is the greenhause gasses which are released due to usage of fossil fuels in transportation applications. Therefore, alternative energy sources are needed but it is not sufficient itself. Suitable energy storage systems are also necessary and these systems have to provide very high amount of energy density and eficiency in order to replace fossil fuels. In that case batteries are very promising technologies however, there is no manufactured battery type in the market which can provide required high energy and power density, so new and more effective technologies have to be investigated for this purpose. One of the best candidates of such technologies is the Li-O 2 battery which is based on the Li-O 2 <b>electrochemical</b> <b>couple.</b> Li-O 2 batteries can achieve approximately ten times higher energy density than that of current state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries by storing the discharge product Li 2 O 2 which occurs as a result of reaction between Li anode and active cathode material, O 2, on the porous cathode material. However, there are various challenges to overcome including high OERORR overpotentials, parasitic side reactions and poor cyclability in order to built commercial Li-O 2 batteries. Especially, unwanted side product formation on the cathode-electrolyte interface is the major challenge itself because these insulator side products accumulate on the cathode surface during cycling and prevent electrical and ionic transportation which cause drastic capacity fading. That is why various catalyst materials have been investigated in order to facilitate the reaction between Li-O 2 <b>electrochemical</b> <b>couple.</b> In this study, we investigated molybdenum oxide which is decorated on multiwalled carbon nanotube catalyst support as an efficient electrocatalyst for Li-O 2 batteries.

Integration in a large format cell requires optimized roll to roll electrode manufacturing and active material utilization. Electrodes are coated on a metal current collector foil in a composite structure comprised of active material, binders, and conductive additives which requires careful control of colloidal chemistry, adhesion, and solidification.

Fundamentals of lithium ion batteries The one common aspect of lithium ion batteries is that during charge lithium ions travel from the positive electrode or cathode through a solid or liquid electrolyte to the negative electrode or anode and during discharge in the opposite direction. At each respective electrode, the ion maintains its ionic form and intercalates into the crystal structure occupying interstitial sites in existing crystals on the anode side or re-occupying a vacant site in the cathode which formed when the lithium ion left that crystal. While transferring that ion, the host matrix gets reduced or oxidized which releases or captures an electron. If the ion would change its state of charge, it would be called a conversion battery such as air batteries.
