40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{architecture}} models for implementing Integrated Systems Health Management (ISHM) capabilities. For example, approaches based on the OSA-CBM and OSA-EAI models, or specific architectures developed in response to local needs. NASA s John C. Stennis Space Center (SSC) has developed one such version of an extensible architecture in support of rocket engine testing that integrates a palette of functions in order to achieve an ISHM capability. Among the functional capabilities that are supported by the framework are: prognostic models, anomaly detection, a data base of supporting health information, root cause analysis, intelligent elements, and integrated awareness. This paper focuses on the role that intelligent elements can play in ISHM architectures. We define an intelligent element as a smart element with sufficient computing capacity to support anomaly detection or other algorithms in support of ISHM functions. A smart element has the capabilities of supporting networked implementations of IEEE 1451. x smart sensor and actuator protocols. The ISHM group at SSC has been actively developing intelligent elements in conjunction with several partners at other Centers, universities, and companies as part of our ISHM approach for better supporting rocket engine testing. We have developed several implementations. Among the key features for these <b>intelligent</b> <b>sensors</b> is support for IEEE 1451. 1 and incorporation of a suite of algorithms for determination of sensor health. Regardless of the potential advantages that can be achieved using <b>intelligent</b> <b>sensors,</b> existing large-scale systems are still based on conventional sensors and data acquisition systems. In order to bring the benefits of <b>intelligent</b> <b>sensors</b> to these environments, we have also developed virtual implementations of <b>intelligent</b> <b>sensors...</b>|$|R

This paper describes a new autocalibrationmethodology for nonlinear <b>intelligent</b> <b>sensors</b> based on artificial neural networks, ANN. The methodology involves analysis of several network topologies and training algorithms. The proposed method was compared against the piecewise and polynomial linearizationmethods.

This paper also shows that the proposedmethod turned out to have a better overall accuracy than the other two methods. Besides,experimentation results and analysis of the complete study, the paper describes theimplementation of the ANN in a microcontroller unit, MCU. In order to illustrate themethod capability to build autocalibration and reconfigurable systems, a temperaturemeasurement system was designed and tested.
