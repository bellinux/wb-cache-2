5|$|It {{took five}} {{minutes for the}} pad workers to open all three hatch layers, and they could not drop the inner hatch to the cabin floor as intended, so they pushed <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to one side. Although the cabin lights {{remained}} lit, they were at first unable to find the astronauts through the dense smoke. As the smoke cleared, they found the bodies, but {{were not able to}} remove them. The fire had partly melted Grissom's and White's nylon space suits and the hoses connecting them to the life support system. Grissom had removed his restraints and was lying {{on the floor of the}} spacecraft. White's restraints were burned through, and he was found lying sideways just below the hatch. It was determined that he had tried to open the hatch per the emergency procedure, but was not able to do so against the internal pressure. Chaffee was found strapped into his right-hand seat, as procedure called for him to maintain communication until White opened the hatch. Because of the large strands of melted nylon fusing the astronauts to the cabin interior, removing the bodies took nearly 90 minutes.|$|E

25|$|In modern times, {{the most}} {{extensive}} restoration took place to the dome during {{the era of the}} Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II in 1915 (1333/1334AH). To facilitate crowd control, the building housing the Zamzam was moved away from its original location, to get <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of the Tawaf, when millions of pilgrims would circumambulate the Kaaba.

500|$|With Annie, it is different. The two of {{them have}} fun making a meal of boiled lobster together. He teases her about the unusual men in her past. He met her playing tennis doubles with friends. Following the game, awkward small talk led her to offer him first a ride up town and then {{a glass of wine}} on her balcony. There, what seemed a mild {{exchange}} of trivial personal data is revealed in [...] "mental subtitles" [...] as an escalating flirtation. Their first date follows Annie's singing audition for a night club ("It Had to be You"). He suggests they kiss first to get <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> After their lovemaking that night, Alvy is [...] "a wreck", while she relaxes with a joint.|$|E
500|$|In 1970, Jagger bought [...] "Stargroves", a {{manor house}} and estate in Hampshire. The Rolling Stones {{and several other}} bands {{recorded}} there using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. Led Zeppelin, used the mobile studio to record material for the albums Physical Graffiti and Houses of the Holy. Dire Straits, Lou Reed, Bob Marley, Horslips, Fleetwood Mac, Bad Company, Status Quo, Iron Maiden and Wishbone Ash all recorded within the mobile studio. The Who recorded [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again" [...] in Stargroves itself. The Rolling Stones mobile studio was also used to record the Deep Purple song, [...] "Smoke on the Water". The lyrics to the song, which they had not intended to release, mention the mobile studio and were intended as a joke about it almost being {{burned to the ground}} by a nearby fire. In order to rescue the mobile from the first started by a flare gun, the Stones crew had to smash a window and release the parking brake to roll <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> Deep Purple referred to it as the [...] "Rolling truck Stones thing" [...] in the song, stating previously in the song [...] "We all came out to Montreux ... to make records with a mobile."

2500|$|Later, {{the chapter}} of the book dealing with the Benghazi attack was leaked to Politico. [...] Observers {{suspected}} this was done to get news about <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> early so it would not dominate later coverage of the book as a whole. Shortly before the book's publication date, a passage that dealt with the now-repatriated soldier Bowe Bergdahl was made public as well. [...] The promotional book roll-out was staffed by veterans of political campaigns and political communications efforts, rather than the publicists who usually conduct such efforts.|$|E
2500|$|Enigk confessed in an {{interview}} in December 2008 that because the band had already broken up during the recording of LP2, he and Hoerner never sat down to complete the lyrics; [...] "We broke up and we just felt like we were done. We put no energy into the artwork or into anything. On a lot of songs, there aren’t lyrics! In a lot of cases, we never sat down to write them, because we just wanted to get <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> as fast as possible. So I just sang a lot of gibberish, which makes it really quirky. My favorite is the Japanese translations".|$|E
2500|$|Two more near-disasters on May 17 led to {{the naming}} of {{additional}} features. [...] William Clark was nearly bitten by a rattlesnake while exploring a creek on the northern side of the river. [...] This creek was named Rattlesnake Creek (although today it is called Timber Creek). [...] The party camped near a creek {{on the south side}} of the river that evening. [...] Clark saw a fortified Native American lodge a short distance up the creek, believing it to be an Atsina (Gros Ventre) site. Late that night, a cottonwood tree sheltering the camp caught fire from sparks rising from the expedition campfire. [...] The men were barely able to get out of their tent and pull <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> before the tree came crashing down on the site. [...] Lewis named this Burnt Lodge Creek (although today it is known as Seven Blackfoot Creek). [...] On May 20, the expedition passed the Musselshell River. On May 22, the party passed another creek, which they decided to name Sacajawea Creek. (Later renamed Crooked Creek, the U.S. government formally changed the name back to Sacagawea Creek in 1979.) The Corps of Discovery left the CMR NWF on May 24 or 25, after spending a week passing through and exploring the area.|$|E

[...] Jackson also disclosed previously unreported details about his financial history and past drug use, saying he wanted to [...] "reveal as many of my weaknesses and shortcomings as a curious press and my opposition might want to look into," [...] and by doing so, [...] "maybe save you and your colleagues some further research." [...] In regards to claims that he thinks birth defects are caused by parents' sins, Jackson said, [...] "I do not believe that birth defects are caused by parents' sin unless, of course, there's a direct scientific connection between the parents' behavior and the disabilities of the child," [...] such as a child who might develop birth defects if his or her mother was addicted to heroin. He also denied that he had said yoga leads to Satanism: [...] "I do not believe that yoga leads to Satanism. One of my ministers is a yoga instructor. What I said was that Christian meditation does not involve emptying oneself but filling oneself ... with the spirit of God. That is classic Biblical Christianity." ...|$|E

They would have to make <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maze with the envelope before the hourglass ran out (two minutes and 30 seconds) in order for the money to be counted. Hillal and Erin were both able to retrieve an envelope each in their runs through the maze, but neither made <b>it</b> <b>out</b> in time, so theirs did not count. However, Sam was able to retrieve his envelope and made <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maze with 30 seconds to spare.
