Given a closed subset X of an infinite compact abelian group G such that w(X) <w(G), {{and an open}} neighborhood U of 0 in T, we show that |{χ∈Gˆ:χ(X) ⊆U}|=|Gˆ|. (Here, w(G) denotes the weight of G.) A subgroup D of G determines G if the map r:Gˆ→Dˆ defined by r(χ) =χ↾D for χ∈Gˆ, is an isomorphism between Gˆ and Dˆ.

Classical methods (incubations) are highly time-consuming and impractical to match physical and chemical measurements in oceanography. Attempting to solve this, a variety of methods (egg production, RNA/DNA ratio, enzyme activities, etc.) have evolved over the last decades. These methods also show many uncertainties and hitherto only in- cubation methods have been widely accepted. Predictive equations relating physiological processes and body weight and temperature, are a rough alternative normally used to ascertain the role of these organ- isms in the ecosystem. However, using imaging systems and empirical relationships to determine body weight allow the application of physiological models to each individual, obtaining reliable estimations for taxonomic groups and size classes. In this study, the physiological rates assessed from predictive equations in combination with an image-based analysis system (ZooImage) were compared with enzy- matic methods.

40|$|Abortion is a loaded, controversial, and {{divisive}} sociocultural {{and political}} term, concept, and debate. Yet little empirical {{research has been}} conducted to examine what effects abortion rights legislation and court cases have had on the public and our society. After analyzing a broad overview {{of the history of the}} abortion rights debate in the US, I conduct bivariate and multivariate regression analyses from 1972 - 2004 using NES and personally-collected data to see how these laws and court opinions in various states at the individual level influence public opinion of abortion rights and of the government. In the end, I conclude that, of the possible iterated relationships therefrom, anti-choice policies have statistically significant impacts on both how people view abortion rights and their own state governments. In doing so, I challenge extant models that describe the interaction between public opinion and policy. I also further develop the idea of Policy Overreach, where policymakers go "too far"-at least, in the eyes of the public-in setting anti-choice policies, causing the public to retaliate in various ways.

40|$|The {{long-term}} interest in nuclear fusion using tokamaks has yielded many published reactor designs. This study performs the first meta-analysis of tokamak reactor designs {{in an attempt}} to unveil new understanding not available in the traditional bottom-up method of looking at each design individually. Forty tokamak designs intended to produce significant fusion power at gains above one were identified in the published literature. Thirty-three important parameters describing a tokamak design were compiled by examining the set. The parameters from each design were extracted and placed into a database and plotted against each other to identify trends and outliers. Major outliers include two low aspect ratio designs and two He- 3 reactor designs. Two classes are apparent in the database indicating two design philosophies: large major radius (~ 7 m), high power (~ 1. 8 GW), and low density (~ 1 * 1020 m- 3) designs utilizing superconducting magnets; and small major radius (~ 2. 5 m), low power (~ 0. 2 GW), and high density (~ 4 * 1020 m- 3 designs utilizing copper magnets. The former class has longer confinement times, higher plasma current, and lower magnetic field while the latter class tends to have lower gain, higher power per surface area, higher power per volume, and much smaller stored magnetic energies. Between the two sets, the non-dimensional plasma physics parameters are similar. These two basic design strategies have been in practice for the last 40 years. Since tokamak designs were first published, there has been little appreciable change in the mean and design envelope of the major parameters such as major radius, fusion power, magnetic field, and plasma current and of the plasma physics parameters such as beta, safety factor, temperature, density, and confinement time. The lack of significant change suggests that no major technological or physics breakthrough that could radically affect design philosophy has been discovered, and neither design philosophy has dominated. Trade-offs in triple product are apparent as all designs are at similar plasma temperature except He- 3 reactors, while confinement time and density vary inversely among designs. The major dependencies on plasma current and size in the experimental confinement time scaling are also apparent. The conservatism inherent in reactor designs can be inferred from plasma physics parameters such as the confinement enhancement factor, normalized beta, and safety factor. The database indicates designers push all plasma physics limits simultaneously instead of individually. by Manuel <b>S.</b> <b>Hernandez.</b> Thesis: <b>S.</b> B., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering, 2016.

Surprisingly, we find the dissociation probability for theta(0) = 90 degrees can be appreciable even though the transitions involved are purely parallel.

For that purpose, {{a number of}} supersonic microjets of O 2 :He mixtures free from O 2 condensation, with O 2 fractions spanning from 2. 5 % to 50 %, have been quantitatively characterized in terms of variations in densities n(z) and rotational populations PJ(z) along the jet direction (z) by means of recording the rotational and vibrational Raman spectra. Number densities n(z) were obtained by comparing {{the intensity of the}} 1555 cm- 1 Raman band in the jet with that from a static sample at a known number density, while rotational populations are extracted from the integrated intensities of the triplets associated with the Raman transitions N¿N+ 2, being N the rotational angular momentum [1]. These primary data are reduced to rotational Trot(z) and translational Tt(z) temperatures. Translational temperatures have been obtained from number densities and rotational temperatures by conservation of mass, momentum, and enthalpy along the jet [2]. These determinations are linked to calculations of state-to-state rate coefficients by means of the kinetic Master Equation which accounts for the time evolution of the rotational populations. The rate coefficients have been computed by solving the close-coupling equations for O 2 + He collisions and using an accurate ab initio potential energy surface [3]. A careful analysis of the Master Equation, which combines experimental and theoretical data, allows us to assess the accuracy of the rate coefficients and, in turn, of the potential energy surface.

40|$|The {{extension}} of the Spanish high-speed rail network into the Basque Country will connect the capital cities of the three Basque provinces, creating an opportunity to drive change at many levels of the transportation network and making the region more attractive to {{both internal and external}} business interests. Accordingly, accessibility improvements can drive economic growth, with particular benefit to traditionally "peripheral" regions {{from the point of view}} of air accessibility such as Donostia-San Sebastiin and Vitoria-Gasteiz. This thesis aims to identify how multimodal integration and decision timelines impact network characteristics that collectively make the region more accessible for business travel both originating in and destined for the Basque Country. The high-speed rail alone will improve accessibility to a few destinations, but a multimodal journey - provided there is a direct high-speed rail connection to Bilbao Airport - results in many sizeable activity centers becoming reachable within a critical timeframe important to business journeys. A system dynamics model captures the relationships between the various subsystems including the high-speed rail network, the urban transportation networks, and Bilbao Airport. The main contribution is to support decision-making that will prevent repeating historical mistakes in the area of intermodality. This approach helps to depict the synergistic nature of sequential decisions that can activate particular system feedback, resulting in compounded benefits. Due to the nonlinearity of complex systems driven by reinforcing and balancing feedback loops, prioritizing intermodality sooner than later will be much more impactful in the long term, leading to not only faster growth but stabilizing and higher levels of performance - creating a sustainably attractive landscape for business activity. by Kari Linn <b>Hernández.</b> Thesis (<b>S.</b> M. in Transportation) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, 2011.

40|$|Given {{the health}} and weight gain {{concerns}} plaguing the country, there is currently a great need for products that encourage athletic activity. A robotic pacing device that facilitates running along a track was developed to help fulfill this requirement. The need for this device, determined from interviews and a survey of experienced running athletes and coaches, {{was found to be}} substantial for a number of age groups and experience levels of runners. An experimental robot prototype was designed and manufactured to aid in pacing runners around a track. The robot was designed to accurately follow the lines of the track using IR sensors that detect reflectivity of the track's surface. The prototype was tested and optimized to determine a successful control logic that reduced error and the amount of overshoot the robot experiences as it adjusts to follow the lines at high speeds. Large overshoots lead to robot malfunction and breakdown in the logic as the robot reaches curves in the track. The optimized prototype currently has the capability of running full lengths around various shaped tracks that incorporate white lines dividing dark colored lanes at speeds of up to eight miles per hour. In this form, the robot might be useful for beginner runners, runners that are doing distance training, and physical education classes that have access to running tracks. Future versions of the robot pacing device will need to incorporate additional features in order to be useful for the full range of people that want to use this product, including a flexible user interface that allows users to program the robot to their needs, a more sophisticated robot control system that allows for accurate control based on the dynamics of the robot, and a more durable cover that is easily spotted by runners looking straight ahead. by Qinyuan (Chen) Liu and Albert <b>Hernandez.</b> Thesis (<b>S.</b> B.)

40|$|G 1 cyclins, in {{association}} with a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), are universal activators of the transcriptional G 1 -S machinery during entry into the cell cycle. Regulation of cyclin degradation is crucial for coordinating progression through the cell cycle, but the mechanisms that modulate cyclin stability to control cell cycle entry are still unknown. Here, we show {{that a lack of}} phosphate downregulates Cln 3 cyclin and leads to G 1 arrest in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The stability of Cln 3 protein is diminished in strains with low activity of Pho 85, a phosphate-sensing CDK. Cln 3 is an in vitro substrate of Pho 85, and both proteins interact in vivo. More interestingly, cells that carry a CLN 3 allele encoding aspartic acid substitutions at the sites of Pho 85 phosphorylation maintain high levels of Cln 3 independently of Pho 85 activity. Moreover, these cells do not properly arrest in G 1 in the absence of phosphate and they die prematurely. Finally, the activity of Pho 85 is essential for accumulating Cln 3 and for reentering the cell cycle after phosphate refeeding. Taken together, our data indicate that Cln 3 is a molecular target of the Pho 85 kinase that is required to modulate cell cycle entry in response to environmental changes in nutrient availability. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology. <b>S.</b> <b>Hernández</b> received a postgraduate Junior Faculty fellowship from the UIC and l'Obra Social la Caixa.

A 100 g batch composition containing ash, CaO and Na 2 O was melted and afterward, poured into water to produce a glass frit. The crystallization kinetic study by nonisothermal method was performed on powder samples (970 °C, and below this temperature there is a predominance of rankinite. The crystallization activation energies calculated by the Kissinger and Ligero methods are equivalent: 374 ± 10 and 378 ± 13 kJ/mol. The growth morphology parameters have equal values n=m= 1. 5 indicating that bulk nucleation is the dominant mechanism in this crystallization process, {{where there is a}} three-dimensional growth of crystals with polyhedron-like morphology controlled by diffusion from a constant number of nuclei. However, differential thermal analysis (DTA) curves on both monolithic and powder glass samples suggest that crystallization of the powder glass sample occurs through a surface mechanism. The divergence in both results suggests that the early stage of surface crystallization occurs through a three-dimensional growth of crystals, which will then transform to one-dimensional growth.

Palmer ### Abstract The {{detection}} of {{correlations between the}} expression levels or sub-cellular localization of different proteins with specific characteristics of human tumors, such as e. g. grade of malignancy, may give important hints of functional associations. Here we describe the method we use for relative quantification of immunofluorescence staining of tumor tissue sections, which allows us to compare between different samples based on objective data. With this strategy we have quantified, for instance, the amounts of nuclear FOXO 3 a and Beta-Catenin proteins in human colon carcinomas. ### Introduction Tissue immunohistochemistry is widely used in clinical pathology to characterize and classify tissue samples of patients. However, in many cases this procedure relies on subjective qualitative criteria. Here we describe the method we use in our laboratory for relative quantification of immunofluorescence staining of tumor tissue sections, which allow us compare between different samples based on objective data. As an example, we describe the following protocol for the measurement of nuclear protein contents (Protein X and Protein Y) in paraffin embedded tissue sections. ### Reagents - Standard reagents for immunofluorescent staining of histological sections ### Equipment - Standard equipment for immunohistochemistry. - Standard confocal microscope. - Image J Software: MBF “ImageJ for Microscopy” program (www. macbiophotonics. ca) ### Procedure 1. Perform a standard immunofluorescent staining of the samples of choice. Stain for a single protein or carry out double immunofluorescence combining suitable secondary antibodies (e. g. Protein X-red, Protein Y-green) and always stain nuclei with DAPI or Hoechst 33342. - Take standard confocal images (at least fife frames for each sample). - Perform immunofluorescence quantification using ImageJ software as detailed as follows: - Define Regions of Interest (ROI, see Fig. 1) using the Polygon or the Freehand selection tool, delimiting tumor tissue from stroma or adjacent regions. - Split the image into {{the two or three}} color channels (RGB Merge/split function) to obtain one image per channel. - First, to determine the average number of cells present in the previously defined ROI, use the Measure option in the program’s ROI Manager, to assess the integrated density value (IDV) for the blue channel (Hoechst 33342 or DAPI staining). - Using the Elliptical selection tool mark at least ten representative nuclei, covering the different sizes and intensities throughout the ROI. Then determine the IDV for all the selected nuclei and calculate the mean nucleus value. - Divide the blue channel IDV by the mean nucleus value. The resulting value corresponds to the average number of cells present in each respective ROI. - Next, to quantify individual Protein X (red) content per nucleus, open the Image calculator from the Process menu. - Create a merged image combining the red channel image with the blue channel image using the operator AND. The merged picture shows nuclear localized Protein X. - Measure the IDV of the respective ROI in this newly created merged image and divide it by the average number of cells calculated before. This represents the Protein X content per nucleus. - Analogously, repeat this procedure with the green channel image to obtain the Protein Y content per nucleus. - The same way, to get the Protein X and Y colocalization signal value, use the Image calculator and the AND operator with the previously merged images of red/blue and green/blue channels. Then repeat the division between IDV the particular ROI and the average number of cells. - Represent the obtained values in scattered plots representing the level of expression for each protein per cell nucleus analyzed, noted as relative units (r. u.) indicating mean and 95 % confidence interval. - Do suitable statistics, such as the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test that is used to compare three or more groups of unpaired values that did not follow any particular distribution. Thereby, Dunn’s multiple comparison post-test serves to identify the significance (P value) of differences in the sum of ranks between each pair of groups of values. ### Troubleshooting - It is essential for relative quantification to define a good control value to refer to. You may compare values between tumors of different stages or you may choose untreated tissue as a reference. - Make sure to obtain a technically homogenous staining. - In the case of analysis of tumor samples, differentiating tumor tissue from stroma or adjacent tissue is a key step during ROI selection to assure integer results. ### References - Rasband, W.

40|$|A new {{magnetic}} polarity stratigraphy {{is reported}} from 214 sampling sites representing 265 m of fluviatile red beds of the Buntsandstein facies succession from the Catalan Coastal Ranges (Riera de Sant Jaume, RSJ section). The Buntsandstein constitutes the lowermost {{of the six}} lithostratigraphic units in which the Triassic from the CCR is subdivided (also grouped into the typical three-fold subdivision of the Germanic Facies from the Tethys Realm: Buntsandstein, Muschelkalk and Keuper). Magnetostratigraphic data from four sections though the uppermost Buntsandstein facies located in the Molina de Aragón area in the Iberian Ranges (Rey, D., Turner, P., Ramos, A., 1996. Palaeomagnetism and Magnetostratigraphy of the Middle Triassic in the Iberian Ranges (Central Spain). In: Morris, A., Tarling, D. R. (Eds.), Palaeomagnetism and Tectonics of the Mediterranean Region, Geol. Soc. Sp. Pub. 105, 59 – 82) are also discussed {{in the light of}} a new biostratigraphic reappraisal of the palynoflora content presented herein. Characteristic magnetizations are carried mostly by hematite with minor contributions by magnetite for the Buntsandstein red beds. The magnetic polarity sequence at the RSJ section consists of 9 magnetozones (and one additional less reliable magnetozone) that are represented by more than two samples. A detailed study along a magnetic reversal indicates that the nature of the remanence in the studied red beds is partially controlled by a chemical magnetization process (delayed remanence acquisition), in addition to a detrital signature (the characteristic primary direction). Chronostratigraphic constraints are provided by conodont fauna from the overlying Muschelkalk facies that indicates a middle–late Pelsonian to late Illyrian age (middle–late Anisian) (Marquez-Aliaga, A., Valenzuela-Rios, J. I., Calvet, F., Budurov, K., 2000. Middle Triassic conodonts from northeastern Spain; biostratigraphic implications. Terra Nova 12, 77 – 83) and a few palynostratigraphic determinations in the Buntsandstein red beds. These biostratigraphic constraints and the magnetic polarity pattern allow an unambiguous correlation of the RSJ magnetostratigraphy to the conodont-ammonoid-calibrated magnetostratigraphy from the Tethys realm (Muttoni, G., Kent, D. V., Meco, S., Balini, M., Nicora, A., Rettori, R. Gaetani, M., Krystine, L., 1998. Towards a better definition of the Middle Triassic magnetostratigraphy and biostratigraphy of the Tethyan realm.

Middle Triassic paleomagnetic data from northern Bulgaria; constraints on Tethyan magnetostratigraphy and paleogeography. Palaeogeogr. Palaeoclimatol.

Tethyan magnetostratigraphy from Pizzo Mondello (Sicily) and correlation to the Late Triassic Newark astrochronological polarity time scale. Geol. Soc. Amer. Bull. 116, 1043 – 1058). The proposed correlation identifies {{for the first time in}} the Triassic from Iberia the Olenekian (Scythian) –Anisian stage boundary (245 Ma) within magnetozone N 3 in the Riera de Sant Jaume units. Likewise, the new palynostratigraphic reconsideration allows the identification of the Anisian–Ladian stage (Illyrian–Fassanian substage) boundary (taken the option at the base of the Curionii ammonoid Zone favored by Muttoni et al. (2004 a) [Muttoni, G., Nicora, A., Brack, P., Kent, D. V., 2004. Integrated Anisian–Ladinian boundary chronology. Palaeogeogr. Palaeoclimatol. Palaeoecol. 208, 85 – 102] for this boundary within the upper part of the Rillo Mudstone and Sandstones Formation (RMS Formation) and the Fassanian–Longobardian substage boundary (Ladinian) within the Torete Multicoloured Mudstone and Sandstone Formation (TMMS Formation). Our data are consistent with the notion that the lower Muschelkalk transgression progressed from east to west (i. e., the Buntsandstein/Muschelkalk boundary is younger in the Iberian Ranges with respect to the Catalan Coastal Ranges). The Early/Middle Triassic paleopole for the Catalan Coastal Ranges is located at 55. 18 N 172. 4 E (Dp= 1. 4, Dm= 2. 7). and the Middle/Late Triassic paleopole for the Iberian Ranges is 558 N 201 E (Dp= 1. 7, Dm= 3. 1). These paleopoles are compatible with the general trend of the Iberian apparent polar wander path which indicates a northward motion during the Triassic related to the general northward translation of Pangea...|$|R

[EN] Hardly could {{those around}} us admit {{that young people}} from our High Schools {{would be able to}} do top level {{scientific}} research. This book demonstrates that, in fact, it is possible. Inside, there are ten papers that summarize the work developed by ten scientific teams with professional researchers and secondary school students at the Estación Experimental del Zaidín (EEZ-CSIC). Once again, our students have had the opportunity of learning about the latest techniques in molecular biology like DNA and protein extraction, DNA amplification using PCR, electrophoresis, gene sequencing, and knowing the most advanced instruments to watch the inner structures of life, as optical and electron microscopes. This is a challenge in which young people can go ahead of their own teachers at their high schools. But PIIISA projects have other advantages as well. These pages include the Proceedings of the III PIIISA-EEZ Congress. Then, our students will have carried out one of the most important features of science: to expose their results to everybody. They are going to learn that science is something meaningless if it cannot be transmited to the society. And moreover, this volume will become their first published paper thanks to the EEZ. And for all of these reasons we, as their teachers, have to thank the EEZ researchers for the important work performed with our students. Because they have been able to accept the challenge of becoming teachers of teenagers, of teaching complex concepts and techniques. And the most important fact: they have succeeded. And in relation to our educative system we can discover new perspectives. At least, in its compulsory levels, it offers a basic formation that lets our students get on in our modern world. But we usually forget that in our hands we also have the scientists of the future, young people who, thanks to projects like PIIISA, are at the forefront and who are going to have a clear view of scientific research much greater that youngsters with the same age. We don’t know if they will study in the future a scientific degree related to the research they have carried out now, but they know that after these experiences, their vision of science will be different, the won’t see science with the same eyes as months ago when they came into the EEZ. But we should not stop here; PIIISA spirit must spread to the rest of the society. PIIISA must be a way that leads to a change in the perception of science in society, a way that definitely launches our country to Science. And this way begins just now, with our students, with researchers, with us, their teachers, with their partners in the classroom, and even though, their families. Without science there is no progress; without progress there is no future. PIIISA shows that all of these objectives are possible. These pages demonstrate it. [ES] Difícilmente aquellos que nos rodean llegarían a pensar que jóvenes de nuestros institutos pudieran ser capaces de llevar a cabo una investigación científica de alto nivel. Este libro demuestra, que de hecho, sí que es posible. Contiene diez artículos científicos que resumen el trabajo llevado a cabo por diez equipos constituidos por investigadores profesionales y por estudiantes de secundaria y bachillerato de institutos granadinos en la Estación Experimental del Zaidín (EEZ-CSIC). Una vez más, nuestros estudiantes han tenido la oportunidad de aprender las últimas técnicas en biología molecular, entre ellas, la extracción de ADN y proteínas, la amplificación de ADN mediante la reacción en cadena de la polimerasa, la secuenciación de genes, o de conocer aquellos otros instrumentos que permiten ver las estructuras más íntimas de la materia viva, como los microscopios ópticos y electrónicos. Es este un reto en el que los jóvenes llegar a ir incluso por delante de nosotros, sus profesores de los centros educativos. Pero PIIISA muestra además otras ventajas. Estas páginas son las Actas del III Congreso PIIISA-EEZ. En ese momento, nuestros estudiantes también habrán llevado a cabo otra de las funciones más importantes de la ciencia, la de exponer los resultados obtenidos. Ellos también aprenderán que la ciencia es algo sin sentido sino se transmite al resto de la sociedad. Y más aún, este volumen contendrá su primer artículo publicado, también gracias a la EEZ. Es por todo ello por lo que, como profesores de estos jóvenes, hemos de reconocer a los investigadores de la Estación Experimental del Zaidín el importante trabajo llevado a cabo con nuestros estudiantes, ya que han sido capaces de aceptar el desafío de convertirse en profesores de adolescentes, de transmitirles técnicas y conceptos complejos. Y lo más importante: han tenido éxito. Y también podemos ver nuevas perspectivas en relación a nuestro sistema educativo. Al menos, en su enseñanza obligatoria, ofrece una formación básica que permite a nuestros alumnado enfrentarse al mundo actual. Pero normalmente olvidamos que también tenemos en nuestras manos a los científicos del futuro, gente joven que, gracias a proyectos como PIIISA, están en la vanguardia y van a tener una visión mucho más clara que otros jóvenes de su edad. Desconocemos si en un futuro ellos estudiarán una carrera relacionada con la investigación que ahora han desarrollado, pero ellos son conscientes de que tras estas experiencias su visión de la ciencia será diferente; no verán la ciencia con los mismos ojos que hace unos meses cuando llegaron a la EEZ. Pero no debemos detenernos aquí. El espíritu PIIISA debe extenderse al resto de la sociedad. PIIISA debe ser un camino que conduzca a un cambio en la percepción de la ciencia en la sociedad, una vía que definitivamente lance a nuestro país hacia la Ciencia. Y este recorrido comienza justo ahora, con nuestros estudiantes, con los investigadores, con nosotros, sus profesores, con sus compañeros de clase y, por supuesto, con sus familias. Sin ciencia no hay progreso; sin progreso no hay futuro. Y PIIISA demuestra que todos estos objetivos son posibles. Estas páginas lo demuestran.
