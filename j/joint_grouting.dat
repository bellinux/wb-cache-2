In this work, an experimental program characterized the seismic behavior of hybrid concrete-masonry frames and showed they do not exhibit the typical strut mechanism observed in unreinforced masonry infill structures.

This study is purposed to identify the subsurface resistivity change of study area before and after grouting using resistivity data from resistivity sounding method. Evaluation towards grouting effect can be determined by comparing the resistivity value change before and after grouting. Grouting effect and its distribution in soil and rock is analysed using isoresistivity map before and after grouting. Methods {{used in this study}} are survey and descriptive method supported by literature references for determine geological and geotechnical characteristics of study area. Geoelectric measurement uses Schlumberger’s configuration array. Resistivity data before and after grouting is used to interpret subsurface section along the study area. Based on this data, the resistivity value change before and after grouting can be analysed. Isoresistivity map is needed to determine the grouting distribution at various definite depths. Type of soil is mould soil which is loose, not compacted, and has uneven density along this area.

40|$|The shear {{behaviour}} of <b>grouted</b> <b>joints</b> {{has been}} studied {{in the recent past}} using the conventional direct shear apparatus, where the normal load on the joint plane is kept constant during testing. The Constant Normal Stiffness (CNS) condition is adopted in this study of shear behaviour of bolted joints, as the CNS condition represents a better approximation of the deformation behaviour of <b>grouted</b> <b>joints</b> in underground excavations as compared to the conventional Constant Normal Load (CNL) condition. A series of tests were conducted to study the behaviour of these stabilised joints under constant normal stiffness condition at an initial normal stress ranging from 0. 13 MPa to 3. 25 MPa, using a large scale CNS testing machine at a controlled strain rate of 0. 5 mm/min. An analytical model has been developed to predict the shear resistance of bolted joints using the Fourier Series. The shear resistance of the bolted joint was defined {{as a function of the}} applied initial normal stress, the normal stiffness of the surrounding rock mass and the shear stiffness of the bolt. Fourier series was used to formulate the dilation behaviour during shearing, which in effect was utilized to predict the variation of normal stress during test process.

40|$|AbstractWith {{regard to}} tunnel design, the {{presence}} of water requires that consideration be given to leakage from and pore water pressure on the lining. A segmented tunnel is generally constructed as a watertight tunnel {{with a certain amount}} of allowable leakage. It has been reported that the leakage from watertight tunnels increases with time due to lining deterioration. The deterioration of <b>joints</b> and/or <b>grouts</b> in segmented linings changes the hydraulic boundary conditions, which results in long-term hydraulic and mechanical interaction, and consequently, an increase in leakage. In this paper, the coupled mechanical and hydraulic interaction between the segment lining and the surrounding ground is investigated using the numerical modeling method. It is identified that hydraulic deterioration causes significant changes in pore water pressure and structural behavior, and accelerates leakage. It is shown that design requirements for joint contact pressure are not sufficient for controlling long-term leakage, as they do not consider hydraulic deterioration. A strain requirement, controlling leakage, and a leakage evaluation method, considering hydraulic deterioration, are proposed in this paper...|$|R
40|$|A pre-grouted rock mass is {{subjected}} to stress re-distribution as the tunnel excavation progresses. The strength and deformation characteristics of <b>grouted</b> rock <b>joints</b> are therefore of interest in any effort to predict the rock mechanical behavior {{as well as the}} failure of sealing in a grouted rock mass. The objective of this thesis was to investigate the basic behavior of <b>grouted</b> rock <b>joints</b> and to study its rock mechanical interaction. Direct shear tests were performed on both grouted and ungrouted, identical high-strength rock joint replicas while injecting water in the joint plane. The tests were done under normal stresses between 2 and 4 MPa with cement grouts having water-cement ratios between 0. 7 and 0. 9. The obtained results were then fitted and used for numerical modeling of representative tunneling situations. The grouted cement affects the joint shear strength in two ways; a cohesive part is added and the friction is reduced. Grout sealing failure of a joint {{subjected to}} shear displacement occurs as a consequence of dilation. Test results indicated that the shear strength of <b>grouted</b> <b>joints</b> were reduced up to 25 % and seepage commenced when the range of elastic, relative shear displacement was exceeded. The results implied that for most applications, that the peak shear strength of <b>grouted</b> <b>joints</b> can be regarded {{as a function of the}} rock contact friction and grout bond strength, using a Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion. The grout sealing failure occurs concurrently with the shear failure. It was concluded from the numerical modeling that, shear displacement in a single, adversely located joint represents a possible seepage path. The most common adverse joint location was found to be parallel with the principal shear stress. It was also concluded that the secondary compressive stress field after tunnel excavation increased the joint shear strength and suppresses the dilation that causes grout sealing failure...|$|R

Masonry vaults, which represent artistic valuable elements, have been recognised {{as the most}} vulnerable elements of such buildings. Therefore, the knowledge of their seismic performances, as well as potential retrofit techniques, meets {{the need to protect}} cultural heritage buildings which are prone to natural hazards. Vault dynamic behaviour is generally studied according to simplified methods or, as an alternative, to complex Finite Element (FE) analyses. However, a deep knowledge of their dynamic behaviour is still lacking from an experimental point of view. In order to investigate the seismic behaviour of masonry vaults, shaking table tests have been performed of a full scale masonry barrel vault. After the tests, the vault has been retrofitted by means of mortar <b>joint</b> repointing, <b>grout</b> injections and Inorganic Matrix FRP Grid (IMG). Then shaking table tests have been performed on the retrofitted vault. By means of the experimental tests outcomes, reliable numerical models able to predict the dynamic behaviour of the masonry vault (before and after the retrofit) have been developed. This aspect is relevant for studying characteristics which cannot be investigated by means of the experimental test monitoring. In this thesis a comprehensive overview of the main results of the experimental tests is reported. The unreinforced vault exhibits a good seismic behaviour, showing very slight damage up to a horizontal acceleration of about 4. 8 m/s 2 (measured at the keystone location).

Howev-er, the study of long-wavelength propagation in a jointed rock mass is challenging in the laboratory, and limited data are available under controlled test conditions. Long-wavelength P-wave and S-wave propagation normal to joints, using an axially loaded jointed column device, reproduces a range of joint conditions. The effects of the normal stress, loading his-tory, joint spacing, matched surface topography i. e., joint roughness, joint cementation e. g., after <b>grouting,</b> <b>joint</b> opening, and plasticity of the joint filling on the P-wave and S-wave velocities and onS-wave attenuation are notable. The ratio VP /VS in jointed rock masses differs from that found in homogeneous continua. The concept of Poisson’s ratio as a function ofVP /VS is unwarranted, andVP /VS can be interpret-ed in terms of jointed characteristics. Analytic models that consider stress-dependent stiffness and frictional loss in joints as well as stress-independent properties of intact rocks can model experimental observations properly and extract joint properties from rock-mass test data.

In this study, tension and shear tests on composite substrate/grout specimens were performed. The composite specimens were consisted of two pieces of substrate connected with one <b>grout</b> <b>joint.</b> The substrate was either stone or brick, whereas hydraulic lime or tripartite (lime-pozzolan cement) or cement grouts were used. The experimental results have demonstrated that the developed tensile and shear bond strength of the studied hydraulic lime and tripartite grouts is comparable with those of cement-based grouts. Moreover, the value of the reached bond strength (tensile or shear) is governed mainly by the substrate characteristics and the binding properties of the grouts. It was also found that interfaces subjected to shear exhibited similar behaviour with interfaces within concrete; thus the beneficial effect of normal compressive stress on the interface was confirmed.

The soil is assumed to behave as an elasto-plastic medium whereas the shield is simulated by beam-joint discontinuous model in which curved beam elements and joint elements are used to model the segments and <b>joints,</b> respectively. As <b>grout</b> is usually injected to fill the gap between the lining and the soil, the property parameters of the grout are chosen {{in such a way that}} they can reflect the state of the grout at each stage. Furthermore, the contact condition between the soil and lining will change with the construction stage, and therefore, different stress-releasing coefficients are used to account for the changes. To assess the accuracy that can be attained by the method in solving practical problems, the shield tunnelling in the No. 7 Subway Line Project in Osaka, Japan, is used as a case history for our study. The numerical results are compared with those measured in the field. The results presented in the paper show that the proposed numerical procedure can be used to effectively estimate the deformation, stresses and moments experienced by the surrounding soils and the concrete lining segments.

This interface {{is made up of}} the backside of the ceramic tile, tile adhesive and the waterproof membrane. In every day used bathrooms water will accumulate in this particular environment. It is calculated that a tiled wall exposed to water in 15 minutes needs approximately six months to dry out since water is sucked, by capillary actions, through the <b>grout</b> <b>joints</b> between the ceramic tiles. The wall dries through diffusion forces and diffusion force is a weaker than capillary force and therefore the drying need longer time than the wetting of the wall with a water accumulation in the interface as a result. Samples were taken from areas where the wall and floor had been exposed to free water regularly, due to showering. Mould and/or bacterial growth was found on 69 % of the analysed specimens from the most water exposed places in the bathrooms. No such growth was found on the samples from the dryer areas. The results shows that although the environment behind the tiles may seem to disadvantaged for microbial growth, due to a limited amount of organic substances and due to pH values not favourable for microbial growth, such growth is possible when the moisture conditions are high. To our knowledge the microbial occurrence in this particular environment has not been investigated before...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of large structures mostly requires a complete three dimensional finite element discretization. Stability of such structures {{includes not only}} the stability of structure itself but also that of foundation as well as interconnection elements. The general instability of a structure may be affected by two aspects, firstly, an inappropriate preliminary classical design of the structure and inadequate control over the geometry {{and quality of the}} materials used for construction. Secondary, the foundation rock and abutments may contain a number of faults and joints which may be unfavorable to stability of the structure. Therefore it is necessary to consider appropriately the influence of interaction between the structure, foundation and abutments under static and dynamic loads. from construction point of view some of the structures such arch dams are divided into vertical blocks, which are separated by vertical <b>joints</b> which are <b>grouted</b> at the later stage. Since the behavior of such and many other structures whose have contraction joints under static and dynamic loads depends largely on those joints, therefore, the presence of structural codes that can recommend the appropriate specifications on modeling these joints, seems to be necessary. The present study contribution deals with the development of three dimensional finite element software including interfacial behavior of joints between different substructures and interaction behavior of structure and foundation to evaluate the safety of the structure subjected to static and dynamic loads. The developed software is verified upon different points of view and the results are in agreement with experiments...|$|R
40|$|Precast {{concrete}} {{structures are}} normally provided with tie connections {{that make it}} possible to transfer tensile forces across the joints. The tie connections are essential for the structural integrity and can contribute to the formation of alternative load-bearing systems in case of local damages of the structure. The aim of the present research was to develop a method for prediction of the load-displacement characteristics of tie connections in the plastic stage. Tie connections between concrete elements were studied experimentally. The load-displacement relationship and the strain distribution along the tie bar were evaluated from measurements. In most of the tests it was possible to obtain large plastic deformations and the ultimate displacement was determined by the rupture of the reinforcing steel. The anchorage capacity of tie bars anchored in <b>grouted</b> <b>joints</b> between hollow core elements was studied in separate test series. A numerical approach was developed for the analysis of tie connections in the plastic stage. The local bond-slip behaviour of the steel-to-concrete interface and the strain hardening of the steel were considered in the analysis. The bond-slip relationships that are recommended today could not be used in the calculations as the yield penetration along the embedded tie bar and, as a result, the displacement was considerably underestimated. Modified bond-slip relationships are proposed which take into account the yielding of the steel. It was found that the load-displacement relationship often had the same proportions as long as ductile types of tie bars were used even when the strength of steel and concrete varied substantially. The relative strain energy was defined and was found to be a valuable parameter describing the ductile behaviour of tie connections. An approach for the analysis of alternative load-bearing system is presented and exemplified. The approach is based on a condition of energy equilibrium. It is shown how the dynamic resistance of an alternative load-bearing system is affected by the ductility and the deformability of tie connections. The theoretical approach was confirmed by dynamic tests where a collapse situation was simulated...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this research work {{was to develop a}} low cost and efficient retrofitting technique for masonry buildings in Pakistan using indigenous materials, technologies and local skills. Three retrofitting techniques; ferrocement overlay, bed <b>joint</b> reinforcement and <b>grout</b> injection were investigated. Ferrocement overlay, also called reinforced coating, is a technique used for rehabilitation and retrofitting of unreinforced masonry buildings in which a steel welded wire mesh is connected to the surface of masonry wall and then plastered with a rich mortar. The efficacy of reinforced plaster is dependent on the bond between masonry and the plaster coating which is established through connectors, e. g. screws or bolts, and the bond between plaster and masonry. This study was carried out through a number of quasi-static reverse cyclic testing on isolated piers, perforated walls and single room building. Shake table test of half scale model before and after retrofitting was also carried out as part of the study. Damage patterns and the force-deformation parameters such as lateral stiffness, lateral strength, deformation capacity, energy dissipation capacity, etc. of specimens tested before and after retrofitting were studied and compared. It was concluded that the proposed cement-based grout might restore or even improve the pre-damaged state of unreinforced brick masonry buildings. Bed joint reinforcement in combination with grout injection might be utilized for local strengthening of cracked regions. Ferrocement overlay, on the other hand, was found very effective in enhancing the overall seismic performance of unreinforced masonry buildings. When applied to both sides of walls in single and double storey unreinforced masonry building, ferrocement overlay in combination with grout injection increased the lateral strength and stiffness by more than 100 % without significantly affecting the deformation and energy dissipating capacities. This technique was found to be more effective on shearcritical piers than rocking-critical piers. This technique is very simple in application because of utilization of locally available materials and with no special skill requirements. This technique is not only simple and efficient but also economical. The total cost of retrofitting (ferrocement overlay and grout injection) is less than 20 % of the cost of replacement of the building. Guidelines for the application of ferrocement overlay and grout injection and detailed procedure for the design of the unreinforced buildings retrofitted with ferrocement overlay are developed. A simple analytical model is proposed for the seismic performance evaluation of unreinforced masonry buildings retrofitted with ferrocement overlay. This model is based on results obtained from experimental work and existing formulations for unreinforced masonry buildings and reinforced concrete members and is calibrated with the test results performed as a part of this study. Performance modification factors for rocking-critical and shear-critical piers, corresponding to various damaged levels, are also proposed that are required for the performance evaluation of damaged buildings...|$|R
40|$|Objective of {{the thesis}} {{is the study}} of the {{influence}} of the connection characteristics on the seismic performance of precast concrete structures. To that end a six storey high building with moment resisting frame was analyzed and designed. The precast concrete building consists of 3 x 6 m span frames at 7. 8 m centre-to-centre in the transverse direction and 7 x 7. 8 m span frames in the longitudinal direction. A 350 mm floor spans in the longitudinal direction. The capacity design method is applied in all the solutions; the concrete structure is verified according to EC 8. The principle of weak beam strong column connection is applied. The bending moment in the column beam connections is calculated through the analysis model considering the stiffness of the connected members. The distribution of the seismic loading on the columns is influenced by the connected beams strength. Capacity design accounts for the connected members strength and its interaction influence during seismic loading. The required seismic design strength in the columns is verified against the action of the connected beams due to seismic loading in a direction and its reversal action. It {{is a function of the}} connected members bending moment strength with an overstrength factor and the seismic bending moment proportion to its bending moment resistance, which accounts for a seismic magnification factor. In the design with monolithic and HFC connections the strength reduction and the over strength factors are applied in the design of the shear in the beams and the columns and the flexural design of the columns, while in the design with DDC and the posttension assemblage, the capacity design principles are applied considering those factors within the design criterias. In the design of the connections the main aspects as yield locations, drift, ductility and degradation is considered with a specific solution for each type of connection. The emulated R/C connection is composed of cast in place elements on the column top. Hybrid-fibre concrete connection composed of precast elements connected on the column top and connected with interior precast concrete B 55 beams The two connection types provides continuity in the stiffness, stresses, and shear. The yielding is relocated from the column faces in the beams where the ductility is provided. The required high shear resistance at the column faces is designed with conventional diagonal shear. In the design with HFC additional reinforcement in the connection core is applied in order to get a stiff and strong connection while the reduction in the reinforcement at the yield locations is used to get use of its high ductility. The Ductile Dywidag connection and the hybrid posttension connection are attached to the columns with ductile bars passing inside the column core and with posttension tendons passing inside PVC through the column. By posttension assemblage mild reinforcing provides energy dissipation during a seismic event is placed at the top and bottom of the beam through the <b>joint</b> and is <b>grouted</b> in place. The design with monolithic connections is verified using the non-linear analysis program Ruaumoko using two records scaled to the design shear force of Ag = 0. 24 g. Both design results are verified for degradation, using Takeda degrading and plastic hinges at the column bases. The design results in available ductility in the beams greater than the ductility resulting from the non-linear analysis. The design with the modified stiffness resulted in improved moment curvature hysteresis behaviour in the column beam connection. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
