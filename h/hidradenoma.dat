40|$|Occurrence of {{basal cell}} {{epithelioma}} and syringocystadenoma papilliferum on sebaceous nevi is well known. But many other adnexal tumors, such as pilar or sweat gland tumours may also be associated with this dysembryoplasia. Out of 99 cases of verruco-sebaceous nevi we find 12 associated {{basal cell epithelioma}}s, 7 syringocystadenomas papilliferum and 6 benign adnexal tumors. Our report is about these 7 cases. All of these tumors appeared in adult-hood and were clinically suggesting the diagnostic of basal cell epithelioma. But, after histopathological examination was performed, they revealed to be 2 nodular <b>hidradenomas,</b> 1 chondroid syringoma, 1 trichilemmoma, 1 apocrine cystadenoma, 1 follicular poroma.

CRTC 1 -MAML 2 fusions were detected in 10 of the 21 neoplasms (47. 6 %). Fluorescence in situ hybridization for MAML 2 break apart was analyzable in 13 specimens and in all these specimens was positive, including 4 tumors with no demonstrable CRTC 1 -MAML 2 fusion.

40|$|The {{granular}} cell myoblastoma ({{granular cell}} tumor) {{is a rare}} lesion of mesodermal origin that occurs {{in many areas of}} the body, including the vulva in seven percent of cases. The exact origin of this tumor is still being investigated. However, nerve cell origin is generally accepted. Lesions of the vulva occur in any age group and must be biopsied to rule out carcinoma, <b>hidradenomas,</b> sebaceous cysts, and papillomas. The recurrence rate of incompletely excised lesions is 25 percent. The microscopic picture of the lesion may simulate carcinoma as a result of reactive hyperplasia of the overlying epidermis.

We examined the immunohistological {{expression of}} p 16 INK 4 a in benign and malignant sweat gland tumors. The ductal and acrosyringial portion of normal eccrine glands were positively stained with p 16 INK 4 a, while it was negative in the normal epidermis. Moderate to strong expression of p 16 INK 4 a was found in 16 of 17 eccrine poromas, 4 of 5 <b>hidradenomas,</b> 3 of 3 syringocystadenoma papilliferums, 2 of 2 mixed tumors, and 3 of 3 syringomas. The p 16 INK 4 a expression was observed focally or diffusely in 4 of 4 porocarcinomas, 4 of 4 apocrine carcinomas and 12 of 17 extramammary Pagetʼs diseases. We conclude that the p 16 INK 4 a expression is not a good marker for dictating malignant transformation of sweat gland tumors. p 16 ^ の免疫組織学的発現は, 表皮の悪性化の指標の一つとされている. 汗腺腫瘍での検討はほとんど行われていない. 我々は, 良性および悪性汗腺腫瘍におけるp 16 ^ の免疫組織学的発現を検討した. 良性汗腺腫瘍では, 17 例中 16 例のeccrine poroma, 5 例中 4 例のhidradenoma, 3 例中 3 例のsyringocystadenoma papilliferum, 2 例中 2 例のmixed tumor, 3 例中 3 例のsyringomaでp 16 ^ の発現を認めた. 悪性汗腺腫瘍では, 4 例中 4 例のporocarcinoma, 4 例中 4 例のapocrine carcinoma, 17 例中 12 例のextramammary Pagetʼs disease でp 16 INK 4 aの発現を認めた. p 16 ^ の免疫組織学的発現は, 良性および悪性汗腺腫瘍でともに高頻度に認められたことから, 良性および悪性汗腺腫瘍を鑑別するマーカーには成り得ないと結論付けた...|$|R
40|$|Cancer-associated {{fibroblasts}} (CAFs) play {{important roles}} in cancer progression through their complex interactions with cancer cells. The secreted bone morphogenetic protein antagonist, gremlin 1 (GREM 1) is expressed by the CAFs of basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), and promotes the growth of cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the expression of GREM 1 mRNAs in various benign and malignant skin tumors, including various BCC subtypes. Analysis by RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) revealed that fibroblasts in the scar tissue expressed GREM 1 and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), whereas resident fibroblasts in the dermis of the normal skin did not express GREM 1. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed significantly higher GREM 1 expression in skin cancers and pilomatricomas (PMCs) than in other benign skin tumors. Tissue microarrays analyzed by RNA ISH for GREM 1 expression also demonstrated that 23 % of BCCs, 42 % of squamous cell carcinomas, 20 % of melanomas, and 90 % of PMCs were positive for GREM 1 expression, whereas trichoepitheliomas, eccrine poromas, <b>hidradenomas,</b> and spiradenomas were negative for GREM 1 expression. Most BCCs that were GREM 1 expression positive were of desmoplastic or mixed subtypes, and GREM 1 expression was localized to activated myofibroblasts at the tumoral-stromal interface. Interestingly, most PMCs harbored GREM 1 -expressing fibroblasts, probably because of the inflammatory responses caused by foreign body reactions to keratin. Additionally, in BCCs, stromal GREM 1 expression had a strong correlation with CD 10 expression. In conclusion, GREM 1 is frequently expressed by myofibroblasts in scars or in the stroma of basal cell carcinomas, suggesting that GREM 1 expression can be a marker for activated myofibroblasts in the cancer stroma or in scar tissue...|$|R

40|$|Cancer is {{a genetic}} disease {{caused by the}} {{accumulation}} of genetic changes such as mutations and chromosomal rearrangements. An increasing number of genetic studies of both hematological and solid neoplasms have shown that recurrent chromosome translocations often result in fusion oncogenes. These are considered as early events in tumorigenesis and are often key regulators of cellular transformation. We have previously shown that the t(6; 9) (q 22 - 23;p 23 - 24) translocation is a recurrent gentic alteration in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) and that the recurrent t(11; 19) (q 21;p 13) translocation in mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) results in a CRTC 1 -MAML 2 gene fusion. Here, {{we have used a}} combination of genetic and molecular techniques, including FISH, RT-PCR, qPCR, transfection studies, and arrayCGH, to (i) gain further insights into the molecular pathogenesis of CRTC 1 -MAML 2 positive/negative MECs and <b>hidradenomas</b> and to study the clinical significance of this fusion, (ii) to identify the target genes of the t(6; 9) in ACC and to study the molecular consequences of this rearrangement, and (III) to characterize the genetic profile of ACC using high- resolution arrayCGH and to identify candidate target genes located within regions of copy number alterations (CNA). Detailed analyses of 29 MECs revealed CRTC 1 -MAML 2 fusions in 55 % of the tumors. The CRTC 1 -MAML 2 fusion protein was expressed in all three MEC-specific cell types and co-localized with CREB in nuclear granules. Analyses of potential targets of the fusion revealed differential expression of cAMP/CREB and Notch targets in fusion-positive and -negative MECs, respectively. Interestingly, fusion-positive patients had a significantly lower risk of local recurrence, metastases or tumor related death compared to fusion-negative patients (p 10 years compared to 1. 6 years for fusion-negative patients. Our findings suggest that MECs may be molecularly classified based on {{the presence or absence of}} the CRTC 1 -MAML 2 fusion and that the fusion is a useful marker in predicting the biological behavior of MECs. Analyses of 20 benign cutaneous <b>hidradenomas</b> showed that the CRTC 1 -MAML 2 fusion is recurrent in the clear cell variant of this tumor. The results indicate that the fusion is etiologically linked to benign and low- grade malignant tumors originating from diverse exocrine glands. Positional cloning of the t(6; 9) translocation in ACC of the breast and head and neck revealed a new mechanism of activation of the MYB oncogene involving gene fusion. The fusion gene consists of MYB exons 1 - 14 fused to the last coding exon(s) of the transcription factor gene NFIB. The fusion results in loss of the 3 ´- end of MYB, including several conserved binding sites for miRNAs that regulate MYB expression negatively. The data indicate that deletion of these target sites may disrupt repression of MYB leading to overexpression of MYB-NFIB transcripts and protein and to activation of critical MYB target genes. Our findings also indicate that the MYB-NFIB fusion is a hallmark of ACCs and that deregulation of MYB and its target genes are key oncogenic events of both diagnostic and therapeutic significance in ACC. High-resolution arrayCGH analysis of 40 MYB-NFIB fusion-positive and -negative ACCs, revealed novel CNAs and significant refinements of previously detected CNAs. The most frequent alterations were losses involving 12 q, 6 q, 9 p, 11 q, 14 q, 1 p, and 5 q and gains involving 1 q, 9 p and 22 q. Using an integrated copy number and global gene expression approach, we identifed several candidate target genes, including NBL 1, SFN, PLAGL 1, and NR 4 A 1, that were down-regulated in tumors with 1 p, 6 q or 12 q deletions compared to tumors without such CNAs. Further characterization of these regions and genes may lead to identification of new biomarkers of pathogenetic, prognostic, and therapeutic importance for ACC...|$|R
