5000|$|For the steering, the {{predominant}} system was a variable-ratio Bishop-design design (modified to provide 46 to 67 mm of rack travel per pinion revolution against the VS' 40 to 58 mm, and a 10.9 m kerb to kerb turning circle for the sedan). The Calais, instead, adopted a speed sensitive [...] "Variotronic" [...] mechanism, criticized for its overall feel. This {{and other new}} electronic systems (such as traction control standard on the Commodore Acclaim and the Calais, and all optional on all other models; to headlights that automatically extinguished themselves some time after parking and the Calais' key-based memory settings) were possible thanks to a multiplex communication bus. This setup was able to circulate 330 parameters per second to the car's major control modules, and {{reduce the number of}} hardwired circuits than if it had conventional wiring throughout (with the VT-series Calais featuring 73 fewer against the VS equivalent). Anti-theft devices included an improved <b>electronic</b> <b>immobiliser</b> (with an extra 16 million codes compared to the VS'), stronger steering lock and latest slip-type locks throughout.|$|E
40|$|Major crime drops were {{experienced}} in the United States and most other industrialised countries for a decade from the early to mid- 1990 s. Yet there is little agreement over explanation or lessons for policy. Here it is proposed that change in {{the quantity and quality}} of security was a key driver of the crime drop. From evidence relating to vehicle theft in two countries it is concluded that <b>electronic</b> <b>immobilisers</b> and central locking were particularly effective. It is suggested that reduced car theft may have induced drops in other crime including violence. From this platform a broader security hypothesis, linked to routine activity and opportunity theory, is outlined...|$|R
40|$|Foreword Despite {{significant}} {{reductions in}} recent years, acquisitive property crime remains {{the single largest}} crime category, with over 700, 000 offences recorded annually by police in Australia. There is potential to further reduce the scale of such offending and the subsequent costs to society by focusing attention {{on the design of}} frequently stolen consumer products in order to reduce their vulnerability to theft. While there is a variety of ways of engaging with manufacturers, government regulation may ultimately be required if other approaches prove unsuccessful. This paper examines the lessons that can be learned {{as a result of the}} regulation of motor manufacturers to install <b>electronic</b> <b>immobilisers</b> on all new cars from July 2001, which has contributed to significant reductions in vehicle crime over the past decade. Eight generic lessons for future regulation of crime prevention design in consumer products are outlined. These lessons should assist policymakers to identify how the costs incurred by the criminal justice system in dealing with acquisitive property crime could be shifted to manufacturers, who arguably contribute to the problem by the way they design and market their consumer products...|$|R
40|$|We provide {{evidence}} for a beneficial welfare impact of a policy targeted at strengthening victim precaution. Regulation made application of the <b>electronic</b> engine <b>immobiliser</b> mandatory for all new cars sold within the European Union. We exploit the regulation as source of exogenous variation in use of the anti-theft device. The device reduced car theft by an estimated 40 %, accounting for both the protective effect on cars with the device and the displacement effect on cars without the device. 34 cars need to be fitted with the device (at a per unit cost of 50 euros) to avert one theft...|$|R
