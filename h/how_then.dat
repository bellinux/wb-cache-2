5|$|Intentionality is the {{capacity}} of mental states to be directed towards (about) or be in relation with something in the external world. This property of mental states entails that they have contents and semantic referents and can therefore be assigned truth values. When one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem: natural processes are not true or false, they simply happen. It would not {{make any sense to}} say that a natural process is true or false. But mental ideas or judgments are true or false, so <b>how</b> <b>then</b> can mental states (ideas or judgments) be natural processes? The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such ideas are about facts. Thus, for example, the idea that Herodotus was a historian refers to Herodotus and {{to the fact that he}} was a historian. If the fact is true, then the idea is true; otherwise, it is false. But where does this relation come from? In the brain, there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to have anything to do with Herodotus.|$|E

Hakuin despaired over this story, as it showed that even a great monk could not be saved from a bloody death in this life. <b>How</b> <b>then</b> could he, just a simple monk, hope to be saved from the tortures of hell in the next life? He gave up his goal of {{becoming}} an enlightened monk, and not wanting to return home in shame, traveled around studying literature and poetry.|$|E
25|$|If the AMPK {{response}} to exercise is responsible {{in part for}} biochemical adaptations to training, <b>how</b> <b>then</b> can these adaptations to training be maintained if the AMPK {{response to}} exercise is being attenuated with training? It is hypothesized that these adaptive roles to training are maintained by AMPK activity and that the increases in AMPK activity in response to exercise in trained skeletal muscle {{have not yet been}} observed due to biochemical adaptations that the training itself stimulated in the muscle tissue to reduce the metabolic need for AMPK activation. In other words, due to previous adaptations to training, AMPK will not be activated, and further adaptation will not occur, until the intracellular ATP levels become depleted from an even higher intensity energy challenge than prior to those previous adaptations.|$|E

25|$|Falegan {{therefore}} remarked thus: ‘The {{supremacy of}} Oore {{as the most}} senior Ooba in Ekiti is contestable for several reasons... He {{was more of a}} mercenary (errand or junior) King at Kiriji war unlike principal kings who hardly leave their palaces ordinarily {{even in the face of}} war as attested to the Ewi... The Ewi controlled territories that are as large as 10 out of 16 Local Government Area of present-day Ekiti State while Oore controlled only a Local Government. Atolagbe noted that Oore was not a Prince of Oduduwa dynastic reign but a benefactor or friend. <b>How</b> <b>then</b> did he became a king, if he was neither a son or Oduduwa nor his lieutenant? The linkage of Oore to Obatala from other sources shows that Oore was either a prominent Ifa Chief or Obatala adherent who came to Ekitiland, if he was not an aboriginal king integrated into Yoruba culture under the dynastic reign of Oduduwa and his successors, children and grandchildren... He could not have been the most senior Yoruba king in Ekitiland, even if he's not an Ekiti aboriginal Oba or Ife aboriginal or an adherent of Obatala. Reference to Oore in Ifa tranche only deduced that he was an Ifa adherent too, whereas the same Ifa tranche adduced that Ado-Ekiti is the home (abode) of Ifa, which invariably made Oore an adherent while the Ewi who superintends over Ado would naturally remain the superior custodian of Ifa religion...The pelupelu where Oore was recognized by the British as the most senior Oba was an imposition at Oke-Imo in 1900 by Major Reeves Tucker. Otherwise, the history of Oore where he adduced to be a co-equal or friend of Oduduwa was never accepted in Ile-Ife tradition as a legend, but a fabrication of traditions.|$|E

Stone was referred to by the court as [...] "Mrs. Lucy Stone Blackwell" [...] and was asked if she wanted to defend herself; she preferred to address the assembly off the record after adjournment, saying [...] "...With my own teeth I would tear open my veins and let the earth drink my blood, rather than wear the chains of slavery. <b>How</b> <b>then</b> could I blame her for wishing her child to find freedom with God and the angels, where no chains are?" ...|$|E

500|$|Arsenal {{entered the}} Champions League group {{stage in the}} 2003–04 season and faced Dynamo Kiev, Internazionale and Lokomotiv Moscow. Without a win in their first three matches, Arsenal faced an early exit from the {{competition}} but managed a victory against Dynamo Kiev, after defender Ashley Cole scored via a header. At the San Siro, Arsenal beat Internazionale 1–5, in a performance described as [...] "one of the greatest results in [...] history". A win in their final group game against Lokomotiv Moscow was enough for Arsenal to top their group and play an unseeded team in the last 16. Arsenal eliminated Celta Vigo and faced fellow English club Chelsea at the quarter-final stage. Going into the first leg, Arsenal were favourites, having played their London rivals three times during the course the season, winning each occasion. Former Dutch international Johan Cruyff backed Arsenal to win the competition, saying [...] "If Arsenal win it playing football the way only they know <b>how</b> <b>then</b> Europe would be proud to have such champions". In spite of Robert Pirès scoring a vital away goal at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea beat Arsenal 1–2 at Highbury to progress into the semi-finals. A year later, Arsenal exited the Champions League after losing 2–3 to Bayern Munich on aggregate, in the last 16 stage.|$|E
500|$|In 1967 {{the critic}} and analyst David Cox {{considered}} {{the question of}} the supposed Englishness of Elgar's music. Cox noted that Elgar disliked folk-songs and never used them in his works, opting for an idiom that was essentially German, leavened by a lightness derived from French composers including Berlioz and Gounod. <b>How</b> <b>then,</b> asked Cox, could Elgar be [...] "the most English of composers"? Cox found the answer in Elgar's own personality, which [...] "could use the alien idioms {{in such a way as}} to make of them a vital form of expression that was his and his alone. And the personality that comes through in the music is English." [...] This point about Elgar's transmuting his influences had been touched on before. In 1930 The Times wrote, [...] "When Elgar's first symphony came out, someone attempted to prove that its main tune on which all depends was like the Grail theme in Parsifal. ... but the attempt fell flat because everyone else, including those who disliked the tune, had instantly recognized it as typically 'Elgarian', while the Grail theme is as typically Wagnerian." [...] As for Elgar's [...] "Englishness", his fellow-composers recognised it: Richard Strauss and Stravinsky made particular reference to it, and Sibelius called him, [...] "the personification of the true English character in music ... a noble personality and a born aristocrat".|$|E
