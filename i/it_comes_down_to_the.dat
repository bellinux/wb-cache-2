PC Gamer US described the game as [...] "welcome on my computer {{for a long time to}} come", in particular praising the non-linear campaign and the sheer scope of the game, awarding it 90%. IGN stated that [...] "... may not have a ton of really noticeable new things when <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> real-time strategy aspect of play, but it definitely had enough to draw me through my jaded curtain and get me playing and interested again". It too praised the campaign, giving the game an overall rating of 8.5 out of a possible 10.|$|E
2500|$|Bezos {{selected}} the name Amazon by {{looking through the}} dictionary; he settled on [...] "Amazon" [...] {{because it was a}} place that was [...] "exotic and different", just as he had envisioned for his Internet enterprise. The Amazon River, he noted, was the biggest river in the world, and he planned to make his store the biggest in the world. Bezos placed a premium on his head start in building a brand and told a reporter, [...] "There's nothing about our model that can't be copied over time. But you know, McDonald's got copied. And it still built a huge, multibillion-dollar company. A lot of <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brand name. Brand names are more important online than they are in the physical world." [...] Additionally, a name beginning with [...] "A" [...] was preferential due to the probability it would occur at the top of any list that was alphabetized.|$|E

Windsor and Abingdon are the only towns between London and Oxford that you can really see anything of from the stream.

5000|$|A mixed review {{comes from}} Allmusic with 3 stars out of 5 saying: [...] "Papa Roach's seventh studio album, The Connection, finds the California band finally {{striking}} {{a balance between}} its early roots as a nu-metal/rap-rock outfit and its more recent interest in '80s-style Sunset Strip hard rock. Featuring production from Sixx: A.M. frontman James Michael as well as Goldfinger's John Feldmann, The Connection includes some creatively slick sounds that flow from buzzy, processed distortion to pulsating, atmospheric electronic flourishes. In some ways, The Connection is perhaps the band's most contemporary-sounding album, though it still remains reverent to the nu-metal sound of the late '90s when <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> overall feel of each tune." ...|$|E
