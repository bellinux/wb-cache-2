40|$|Drama {{activity}} {{presents a}} great challenge for ado­lescents with physical disabilities, {{and at the same}} time it provides them with much <b>experience</b> <b>for</b> <b>life.</b> Adolescents are educated through theatrical activ­ity; they test numerous new roles, develop their attitude towards the art culture, and most of all they get the insight into different life situations, which have not been known to many of them so far. By experiencing different roles, an adolescent gets personal recognition, undergoes a process of personal changing and thus tests his or her per­sonal perceptions of life. As regards drama activity we follow the presump­tion saying that being different is also an advan­tage. The main purpose of the drama activity is gradu­ally realized through the programme: getting to know yourself and the theatre medium in general. Adolescents meet the multilayered communication and public appearance, which helps them in their personal life...|$|E
40|$|The {{mountains}} of data thrusting {{from the new}} landscape of modern high-throughput biology are irrevocably changing biomedical research and creating a near-insatiable demand for training in data management and manipulation and data mining and analysis. Among life scientists, from clinicians to environmental researchers, a common theme is the need not just to use, and gain familiarity with, bioinformatics tools and resources but also to understand their underlying fundamental theoretical and practical concepts. Providing bioinformatics training to empower life scientists to handle and analyse their data efficiently, and progress their research, is a challenge across the globe. Delivering good training goes beyond traditional lectures and resource-centric demos, using interactivity, problem-solving exercises and cooperative learning to substantially enhance training quality and learning outcomes. In this context, this article discusses various pragmatic criteria for identifying training needs and learning objectives, for selecting suitable trainees and trainers, for developing and maintaining training skills and evaluating training quality.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an integration of transpersonal structural theory. It is claimed that a “dichotomy debate” is currently taking place within transpersonal psychology, which involves what Wilber {{has called the}} “pre/trans fallacy” (1993) and the “ascender/descender debate” (1995). The pre/trans fallacy states that early, prepersonal <b>life</b> <b>experiences</b> are confused <b>for</b> transpersonal <b>experiences</b> of higher consciousness. Yet Grof (1985, 2000) and Washburn (1995) contend that early, prenatal, life experiences are legitimate sources of transpersonal experience, and {{can be thought of}} as the presence of deeper consciousness. Consequently, it is suggested that confusing prepersonal <b>life</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>for</b> prenatal <b>life</b> experiences—as well as preferring higher stages over deeper stages of transpersonal consciousness—commits the “trans/trans fallacy. ” Finally, it is claimed that Avatar Adi Da’s (1997, McDonnell, 1997) spiritual revelation provides the missing link whereby transpersonal structural theory can be integrated: the “conjoining” of the prenatal and prepersonal selves...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} {{was to examine the}} experience of extended periods of immigration detention from the perspective of previously detained asylum seekers and to identify the consequences of these <b>experiences</b> <b>for</b> <b>life</b> after release. The study sample comprised seventeen adult refugees (sixteen male and one female; average age 42 years), who had been held in immigration detention funded by the Australian government for on average three years and two months. They were interviewed on average three years and eight months following their release and had been granted permanent visa status or such status was imminent. The study employed a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to explore detention and post-detention experiences, and mental health some years after release. The qualitative component consisted of semi-structured interviews exploring psychological well-being, daily life, significant events, relationships, and ways of coping throughout these periods. This was supple- mented with standardised quantitative measures of current mental health and quality of life. All participants were struggling to rebuild their lives in the years following release from immigration detention, and for the majority the difficulties experienced were pervasive. Participants suffered an ongoing sense of insecurity and injustice, difficulties with relationships, profound changes to view of self and poor mental health. Depression and demoralisation, concentration and memory disturbances, and persistent anxiety were very commonly reported. Standardised measures found high rates of depression, anxiety, PTSD and low quality of life scores. The results strongly suggest that the psychological and interpersonal difficulties participants were suffering at the time of interview were the legacy of their adverse experiences while detained. The current study assists in identifying the characteristics of pro- longed immigration detention producing long-term psychological harm...|$|R

In the introduction I write {{about the issue of}} social pedagogy and about the work of social pedagogues, about their competences and their qualifications to work with pupils. I mention the postmodern society and young people. The product of modern style of life is the separation between people and nature. Similarly the children are less and less connected with outside environment, because they spend most of their free time inside. Then I present the mountain group. The mountain group is the school course and is part of the activities school offers and because of this fact I discuss also the modern school and ways to spend free time. School courses present important part of lifelong learning. The basic part discusses mountaineering and work with mountain group. I present the plan of work and all the activities we carried out in this school year. I took into account the aspects of empirical pedagogy and mountain goals and knowledge. Children and the youth in the group and through experiences in nature get new dimensions of place and time, they satisfied their need for moving, being successful. The need to beat the effort, the need to experience adventures, the need to play, the need to positive emotional experiences, the need to associate are also satisfied. They improve their self-confidence and improve their knowledge about mountains and nature. The children and youth that are satisfied with themselves and admire themselves have less difficulties in solving conflicts. They are also better prepared to avoid negative influence from outside and these are precious <b>experiences</b> <b>for</b> <b>life.</b> They are better prepared for future challenges. ...|$|R

40|$|The school {{counselor}} has usually assumed {{the responsibility for}} promoting career development within the school setting through individual and group guidance and counseling activities. Unfor-tunately, many counselors have had less time to perform these traditional role assignments because of the increased demands placed on them by administrators {{as well as their}} need to assist students confronted by a multitude of societal influences of rather recent origin (Peters and Hansen, 1977). For many young people, this has been translated into uninformed career decisions or no decisions at all. Conventional approaches to career develop-ment in many cases have either been inaccessible to students or have not provided the types of experiences that lead to career maturity. A problem of this magnitude emphasizes the need for identifying new solutions to an old problem. Many school districts throughout the country have used limited local resources to implement a variety of career education programs targeted for a range of individuals from kindergarten throughout adulthood. Only recently has Congress enacted Public Law 95 - 207, The Career Education Incentive Act, that provides seed money to state education agencies and local school districts to implement programs of career education. Sidney Marland’s (1971) early commentary on the possibilities that the concept of career education holds for promoting a broader range of <b>experiences</b> <b>for</b> <b>life</b> career planning has generated much interest nationwide. In efforts to define career education as a concept, five basic components have been identified by the U. S. Office of Education (Hoyt, Mackin and Mangum, 1972). Primary among these is the component of career development programs begin-ning as early as kindergarten and continuing throughout all of adult education.

If cure is not obtained, hope for the participant moves to a 'good death'. If the outcome is cure, however, the hope <b>for</b> <b>life</b> has been realised for both participant and observer. Hope, which is always for the future, may now diverge between participant and observer. Observers hope for a return to normality, and use a discourse of normality which emphasises such things as 'getting over it', 'moving on' and 'getting back to normal'. Survivors may not find the realisation of hope <b>for</b> <b>life</b> to be as comfortable as might be expected. After the euphoria of being declared free of disease, about 30 % of survivors develop post-cancer distress with death salience. They recognise, whether they want to or not, that they have confronted their own annihilation, and that they will at some stage have to do so again. We all know that we will die, but there is a greater vividness and proximity in that knowledge for someone who has been through mortal extreme experience. Death salience provokes a confrontation with meaning in a person's life. Thus survivors turn inward to their deep selves in order to establish an understanding of what their life projects might become. Observers, on the other hand, find death salience hard to live with, and may turn away from the distressed survivor. The hopes and discourses of survivors and those close to them may have different structures and different objects. These differences may help to explain the frequency with which stress and disruption affect close relationships after cancer and other life-threatening experiences.
