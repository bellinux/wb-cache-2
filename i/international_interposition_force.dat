5000|$|Further talks {{held under}} the aegis of ECOWAS in Abuja, Nigeria, {{resulted}} in the signing of a peace accord on 1 November. Under the accord's terms, the two sides reaffirmed the cease-fire of 25 August and resolved that the withdrawal of Senegalese and Guinean troops from Guinea Bissau be conducted simultaneously with the deployment of an ECOMOG (ECOWAS Cease-fire Monitoring Group) <b>interposition</b> <b>force,</b> which would guarantee security on the border with Senegal.|$|R
5000|$|In January 1999, Fadul {{announced}} that presidential and legislative elections {{would not take}} place in March as envisaged in the Abuja accord, and would be delayed {{until the end of}} the year. Also in January agreement was reached between the government, rebels and ECOWAS on the strength of the ECOMOG <b>interposition</b> <b>force,</b> which was to comprise some 710 troops. Agreement was also reached on a timetable for the withdrawal of Senegalese and Guinean troops from Guinea-Bissau.|$|R
5000|$|The MNF (multinational force) is {{to provide}} an <b>interposition</b> <b>force</b> at agreed {{locations}} and thereby provide the MNF presence requested by the Government of Lebanon to assist it and Lebanon's armed forces in the Beirut area. This presence will facilitate the restoration of Lebanese Government sovereignty and authority over the Beirut area and thereby further its {{efforts to assure the}} safety of persons in the area and to bring to an end the violence which has tragically recurred.|$|R
50|$|The four-nation MNF {{was created}} as an <b>interposition</b> <b>force</b> meant {{to oversee the}} {{peaceful}} withdrawal of the Palestine Liberation Organization. The participants included the U.S. Multinational Force (USMNF), which consisted of four different Marine Amphibious Units (MAUs); British 1st Dragoon Guards cavalry regiment; the 1st inter-arm Foreign and French Brigade, 4 Foreign Legion Regiments, 28 French Armed Forces regiments including French and Foreign paratroopers, units of the National Gendarmerie, Italian paratroopers from the Folgore Brigade, infantry units from the Bersaglieri regiments and Marines of the San Marco Regiment. Additionally, the MNF {{was in charge of}} training various units of the Lebanese Armed Forces.|$|R
5000|$|Frazer's {{tenure as}} Assistant Secretary of State was a {{controversial}} one: She was {{considered one of}} the most powerful and outspoken Assistant Secretaries in the Bush Administration. Yet, an August 2009 report by the State Department's Office of the Inspector General reviewed 50 years of Africa policy and criticized the Africa Bureau describing it as low resourced and being hobbled by low morale, and a lack of qualified personnel and a [...] "failed" [...] public diplomacy program. The report focused on 50 years of the bureau's history and not specifically Frazer's tenure. [...] Interestingly, the Inspector General's office criticized the Africa Bureau while Africa policy under the Bush Administration was widely heralded as one of the Administration's most successful foreign policy achievements. [...] John Bolton, the Bush Administration's Ambassador to the United Nations, accused Frazer of setting back his plans to end the U.N. Mission in Eritrea-Ethiopia that monitored and acted as an <b>interposition</b> <b>force</b> along the disputed border between Ethiopia and Eritrea by unilaterally deciding that the 2002 decision of the Ethiopian-Eritrean Boundary Commission should be cast aside to favor Ethiopia's position. Frazer disputed Bolton's claim since U.S. policy continued to recognize the EEBC decision.|$|R
500|$|The Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP) {{called an}} {{extraordinary}} meeting {{to take place}} in Lisbon on 14 April. The meeting was to be attended by the foreign ministers of the member countries: Angola's Georges Rebelo Chicoti, Brazil's Antonio Patriota, Guinea-Bissau's Mamadou Djalo Pires, Mozambique's Oldemiro Julio Marques Baloi and Portugal's Paulo Portas. [...] The CPLP also condemned the coup and exhorted the UN, African Union (AU) and ECOWAS to work towards restoring the [...] "constitutional order" [...] of Guinea-Bissau. They further called for a cessation of military actions that threatened the state or the [...] "legality" [...] of Guinea-Bissau. At the CPLP meet in Lisbon, Pires had said that the [...] "persecution is continuing." [...] The CPLP later issued a statement of condemnation and also called for a UN-authorised military intervention saying that it had [...] "take the initiative of...forming an <b>interposition</b> <b>force</b> in Guinea-Bissau, with a mandate defined by the United Nations Security Council" [...] that would seek to maintain [...] "constitutional order, protect civilians and the country's legitimate institutions." [...] It added that it supported the Angolan presence in the country and the initiate would be carried out according to consultations with ECOWAS, the AU and the EU. Rifts developed between ECOWAS and CPLP over the resolution mechanisms. The former, supported by Nigeria, Senegal, CÃ´te d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso, advocated a year-long transitional process; while the later, supported by Portugal and Angola, advocated an immediate resumption of the election.|$|R
40|$|In {{the typical}} {{scenario}} of traditional peacekeeping, the UN has acted as an <b>interposition</b> <b>force</b> {{between the parties}} to the conflict. Today however, the UN is no longer the sole component in a mission structure inasmuch as today s peace operations are increasingly multidimensional in both design and purpose. As a result, a common realization has come to be that the success of a mission depends on the actors involved pulling their resources together towards a commonly agreed end product. The concept of integrated missions is the UN response to these calls for simultaneously political, military, humanitarian and developmental efforts. However, although most stakeholders agree why mission integration is important, significant challenges remain when it comes to implementation. Against this backdrop, the Norwegian government has initiated a project to take stock of the current debate. This thesis investigates how the integrated mission concept has moved from an idea towards an institutionalized norm for UN peace operations. Hence the study fulfils a twofold objective. Regarding the empirical achievement, the thesis displays the role a state can play in relation to the ongoing process of UN reform. Concerning the theoretical aim, the study investigates the emergence of an international norm. By reviewing theoretical contributions, I extract what existing IR-theory can tell us about how norms evolve. Based on this, I advance a model on norm emergence which divides the norm life-cycle into three stages consisting of innovation, diffusion and institutionalization. The integrated mission concept is then applied to provide an empirical illustration of this model...|$|R
40|$|The United Nations, as an {{organisation}} {{created by}} equal sovereign states and built upon a single {{set of principles}} as the UN Charter, has the capacity and responsibility to deal with matters {{in the sphere of}} international peace and security. The Cold War put an obstacle {{in the way of the}} Organisation to use its delegated powers in conflict resolution within the few years of its establishment. As a result, and because of the necessity to deal with international conflicts, the institution of peace-keeping emerged with the aim of deploying forces not to end the aggression, breach of or threat to the peace, but for supervision of cease-fires or providing an <b>interposition</b> <b>force</b> between the belligerents, characterised by impartiality and a limited military capability. The demise of the Cold War offered the opportunity to the Organisation, especially to the Security Council, to use its powers to implement law and order among nations. In the post-Cold War era, the Security Council extended its interpretation of the notion of "threat to the peace" and restricted the principle of "domestic jurisdiction". The Council has authorised an individual state or a group of states to use force for humanitarian purposes and human rights concerns. To study the role of the United Nations in the field of international peace and security, and to investigate its developments, legality of actions, successes and failures, it is necessary to gain a clear understanding of what was originally intended by the founders of the Organisation. This thesis examines initially the provisions of the Charter on the role of the UN organs in maintaining and restoring international peace and security with reference to the discussions at the San Francisco Conference. Since the institution of peace-keeping was not envisaged in the Charter, an investigation is carried out on its constitutional and legal basis, referring to the advisory opinion of the international Court of Justice and Chapters VI and VII of the Charter...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceColon <b>interposition</b> is {{the method}} of choice to restore the {{digestive}} tract after esogastrectomy. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the length of the four available routes for colon transposition (posterior mediastinum route, transpleural route, substernal route and subcutaneous route) and to achieve a specific evaluation of the transpleural route. Our study was conducted with anatomical (dissection) and radiological (2 D CT scan reconstructions) protocols. For both, the posterior mediastinum route was always the shortest way and the subcutaneous route was always the longest. For the anatomical results, the transpleural route and the substernal route were similar in terms of length and for the radiological study, the transpleural route was shorter than the substernal route (P < 0. 001) and shorter than the subcutaneous route (P < 0. 001). We demonstrated that the transpleural route was acceptable for colon transposition in term of length, and could be an alternative when the substernal route is unavailable...|$|R
50|$|A {{report on}} {{peacekeeping}} and peace enforcement in the 1990s for the United States Army established this difference between peace enforcement and peacekeeping: Peacekeeping, a role the U.N. has played over the years, is relatively straightforward and, despite its difficulties, comparatively easy. Peacekeeping involves monitoring and enforcing a cease-fire {{agreed to by}} two or more former combatants. It proceeds in an atmosphere where peace exists and where the former combatants minimally prefer peace to continued war. Peace-enforcement, as it {{is used by the}} United States Joint Chiefs of Staff, entails the physical <b>interposition</b> of armed <b>forces</b> to separate ongoing combatants to create a cease-fire that does not exist. Boutros-Ghali, on the other hand, uses the term to refer to actions to keep a cease-fire from being violated or to reinstate a failed cease-fire. It is a subtle difference, but it does imply the existence of some will for peace. The American version more realistically portrays another, far more difficult matter. By definition, in a situation for which peace-enforcement is a potentially appropriate response, war and not peace describes the situation, and {{one or more of the}} combatants prefer it that way. This means that, unlike peacekeepers, peace enforcers are often not welcomed by one or either side(s). Rather, they are active fighters who must impose a cease-fire that is opposed by one or both combatants; in the process, the neutrality that distinguishes peacekeepers will most likely be lost.|$|R
