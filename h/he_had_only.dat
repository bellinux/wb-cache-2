5|$|George Schwab was a German {{shoemaker}} {{who died}} in 1924. German anarchist Carl Nold claimed he learned Schwab was the bomber through correspondence with other activists but no proof ever emerged. Historian Paul Avrich also suspected him but noted that while Schwab was in Chicago, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> arrived days before. This contradicted statements by others that the bomber was a well-known figure in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|In 1976 Giridhar {{topped the}} final Acharya {{examinations}} in Vyakarana, winning seven gold medals and the Chancellor's gold medal. In a rare achievement, although <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> enrolled for a master's degree in Vyakarana, he was declared Acharya of all subjects {{taught at the}} university on 30 April 1976.|$|E
5|$|Jesé {{struggled}} {{to settle in}} Paris, however, {{and by the end}} of the year <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> started in one of his nine league appearances for the club. His lack of form and infrequent game time, which totaled 358 minutes, prompted manager Unai Emery to suggest that he would be leaving the club during the January transfer window in order to rediscover his form.|$|E

5|$|After his acclamation, Maximian was {{dispatched}} {{to fight the}} rebel Bagaudae, insurgent peasants of Gaul. Diocletian returned to the East, progressing slowly. By 2 November, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> reached Civitas Iovia (Botivo, near Ptuj, Slovenia). In the Balkans during the autumn of 285, he encountered a tribe of Sarmatians who demanded assistance. The Sarmatians requested that Diocletian either help them recover their lost lands or grant them pasturage rights within the empire. Diocletian refused and fought a battle with them, {{but was unable to}} secure a complete victory. The nomadic pressures of the European Plain remained and could not be solved by a single war; soon the Sarmatians would have to be fought again.|$|E
5|$|After his release, Brouthers {{played for}} {{a minor league}} team in Rochester, New York, and on one {{occasion}} in , he hit a game-winning home run in an exhibition game versus the Buffalo Bisons, off future Hall of Fame pitcher Pud Galvin. He hit well enough in the minors to get another shot with the Trojans, which lasted just three games when <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> two hits in 12 at bats, and he was released again.|$|E
5|$|After {{his term}} as governor, Brown again {{returned}} to his legal practice in Louisville. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the House of Representatives in 1896, losing to Republican Walter Evans. He would later claim that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> run {{in order to improve}} Democratic voter turnout for William Jennings Bryan's 1896 presidential bid. Prior to the 1899 Democratic nominating convention, Brown was mentioned as a possible gubernatorial nominee, but he declined to become a candidate. When the convention began, he was mentioned as a candidate for convention chairman, but he also refused to serve in this capacity.|$|E

5|$|After the war, courts-martial were convened to {{investigate}} possible war crimes {{by members of}} the division. In the first case, dubbed the Biscari massacre, American troops from C Company, 180th Infantry Regiment, were alleged to have shot 74 Italian and two German prisoners in Acate in July 1943 following the capture of an airfield in the area. Lieutenant General George Patton, the Seventh Army commander, asked Major General Omar Bradley, commanding II Corps, to get the case dismissed to prevent bad press, but Bradley refused. A non-commissioned officer later confessed to the crimes and was found guilty, but an officer who claimed <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> been following orders was acquitted.|$|E
5|$|Among Cincinnati receivers, {{there was}} none of the {{uncertainty}} that afflicted the Bearcats' quarterbacks. Wide receiver Mardy Gilyard caught 74passes during the regular season, setting a Cincinnati record with 1,118receiving yards. He also had 10touchdowns during the season, leading all Cincinnati players. Gilyard also played as the Bearcats' primary kick returner. He returned 32kicks, accumulating a school-record 897yards and 2touchdowns. Fellow wide receiver Dominick Goodman outpaced Gilyard in receptions with 78, but <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> 977receiving yards and 7touchdowns. On the first play of Cincinnati's game against Hawaii, Dominick injured his shoulder {{and his ability to}} play in the Orange Bowl was in doubt.|$|E
5|$|Anderssen {{was very}} {{successful}} in European tournaments from 1851 to early 1878, taking first prize in {{over half of the}} events in which he played. His only recorded tournament failures were a one-game-per-round knock-out event in 1857 and sixth place at Paris 1878 when his health was failing and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> about a year to live. His match record was much weaker: out of the 12 that he played, he won only two, drew four and lost six.|$|E

5|$|Berkman {{stayed in}} jail for two months {{awaiting}} his trial. He had one hour per day of exercise with other prisoners. They could not understand his motive for the attack on Frick. Surely {{it must have been}} a personal dispute or a business quarrel. His explanations were met with condescending smiles. One fellow prisoner, a Homestead worker who was about to stand trial for throwing dynamite at the Pinkertons, told him the workers did not believe in violence. Berkman had no connection with Homestead, and the strike was none of his business. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> hurt the workers' cause with his action.|$|E
5|$|Cannon had {{a modest}} 1968 {{season in which}} he caught six {{touchdown}} passes—including one of 48 yards {{in the second quarter}} of the famous Heidi Game—but knew he would not be in Oakland much longer. Head coach John Madden had relegated him to running decoy routes by 1969 and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> two touchdowns. Nevertheless, he was invited as a replacement to play in his second All-Star game. Cannon was released by the Raiders during the 1970 preseason.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{needed a}} {{production}} studio for the film, but recognized the great {{cost of the}} movie, especially during the Great Depression. Cooper helped David Selznick {{get a job at}} RKO Pictures, which was struggling financially. Selznick became the vice president of RKO and asked Cooper to join him in September 1931, although <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> produced 3 films thus far in his career. Cooper began working as an executive assistant at age thirty-eight. He officially pitched the idea for King Kong in December 1931. Shortly after, he began to scope out actors and build full-scale sets, although the screenplay was not yet complete.|$|E

5|$|Harvey {{was not at}} {{his best}} in the five Tests. In the 11 innings {{leading up to the}} Tests, Harvey's lowest score was 14, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> failed to pass 30 twice. However, in the First Test at Trent Bridge, Harvey had a duck and two and falling twice to Bedser as Australia hung on for a draw in a rain-affected contest. After scoring 69 against Yorkshire, Harvey made 59 and 21 in the Second Test at Lord's, again falling to Bedser in both innings. Some {{tenacious}} batting in the second innings saw the hosts save the match with three wickets in hand.|$|E
5|$|His {{role with}} the team diminished over the {{following}} two seasons, as McGrattan appeared in only 45 games in 2006–07 and 38 in 2007–08. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> five points and 146 PIM combined between the two seasons. McGrattan made headlines midway through the 2007–08 campaign when he fought teammate and goaltender Ray Emery – himself a noted fighter – in practice. McGrattan's on-ice performance had suffered over time in Ottawa {{as a result of}} a worsening drinking problem he had developed beginning early in his career with Binghamton.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the gradual}} estrangement of Brian Jones and his {{decreasing}} musical contributions – <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> appeared on two tracks on the then in-progress Let It Bleed — made {{a return to}} touring problematic. They had shelved The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus after having been upstaged by The Who.

5|$|In {{qualifying}} Hamilton {{took his}} first pole position {{as part of a}} McLaren one-two. Heidfeld improved on his practice performance to take third position, in front of the Ferraris of Räikkönen and Massa.
