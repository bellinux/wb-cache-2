An experiment demonstrated that higher <b>identifiers</b> primed with an out-group showed faster responses to self-words than higher <b>identifiers</b> primed with the in-group. This findings suggest that the personal-self is also activated for higher <b>identifiers</b> primed with an out-group, and this self-activation may underlie their contrastive responding...|$|R

40|$|Three {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to investigate the power of group norms of individualism and collectivism to guide self-definition and group behavior for people with low {{and high levels of}} group identification. Study 1 demonstrates that in an individualist culture (North America), those who identify highly with their national identity are more individualist than low <b>identifiers.</b> In contrast, in a collectivist culture (Indonesia) high <b>identifiers</b> are less individualist than low <b>identifiers.</b> Study 2 manipulates group norms of individualism and collectivism, and shows a similar pattern on a self-stereotyping measure: High <b>identifiers</b> are more likely to incorporate salient group norms prescribing individualism or collectivism into their self-concept than low <b>identifiers.</b> Study 3 replicates this effect and shows that high <b>identifiers</b> conform more strongly to group norms, and self-stereotype themselves in line with the salient norm than low <b>identifiers</b> when their group is threatened. Hence, the findings suggest that when there is a group norm of individualism, high <b>identifiers</b> may show individualist behavior as a result of conformity to salient group norms...|$|R
