500|$|The {{common name}} jackdaw first {{appeared}} in the 16th century, and is thought to be a compound of the forename Jack, used in animal names to signify a small form (e.g. <b>jack</b> <b>snipe),</b> and the archaic native English word daw. Formerly, western jackdaws were simply called [...] "daws". The metallic chyak call may be the origin of the jack part of the common name, but this is not supported by the Oxford English Dictionary. Daw, first used for the bird in the 15th century, is held by the Oxford English Dictionary to be derived from the postulated Old English dawe, citing the cognates in Old High German tāha, Middle High German tāhe or tāchele, and modern German Dahle or Dohle, and dialectal Tach, Dähi, Däche and Dacha.|$|E

500|$|Esther {{fulfills}} Torchwood's technical {{need for}} a competent hacker, researcher and computer expert. However, she initially struggles as a field agent, nearly compromising the team's mission when she attempts to get help for her mentally ill sister Sarah (Candace Brown). Later whilst trying to escape during an undercover mission in an effective concentration camp, in which the gravely wounded are incinerated, Esther strangles Colin Maloney (Marc Vann) in unarmed combat, leaving her aghast and shaken. In the following episode, Esther works out that Gwen is being blackmailed into delivering Jack to an unknown conspirator; she has Gwen's parents liberated by Sergeant Andy Davidson (Tom Price), and alongside Rex, successfully <b>snipes</b> <b>Jack's</b> would-be captors. The Torchwood team subsequently end up in CIA custody. Though Esther is pardoned alongside Rex, Jack is shot {{as he tries to}} escape, leaving Esther with the responsibility of keeping him safe on the run. Two months later, in [...] "The Gathering", Esther has nursed Jack to health in Scotland where she drains his blood, believing it connected to the Miracle. The team learn that the Miracle originated at the near-antipodes of Shanghai and Buenos Aires; the team splits up, with Esther and Rex in the latter location. The series finale, [...] "The Blood Line", sees Esther fatally shot by a member of The Three Families— the villains behind Miracle Day— in an attempt to prevent Torchwood ending the Miracle, but Gwen persuades Jack and Rex that Esther has to die so that the Miracle can be ended. In the episode's epilogue, Esther is among the few post miracle deceased to be allowed a full funeral service.|$|R
50|$|<b>Jack</b> <b>snipe</b> can be secretive {{in their}} non-breeding areas and are {{difficult}} to observe, being well camouflaged in their habitat. Consequently, birdwatchers have developed a specialised technique for finding them. This involves walking through its marshy habitat until a bird is disturbed and flies up. <b>Jack</b> <b>snipe</b> will squat down and not flush from cover until an intruder is quite close. They then quietly fly a short distance before dropping back into vegetation.|$|E
50|$|Great Bernera hosts {{numerous}} seabird species, including gulls, waders {{and ducks}} such as goldeneye. More unusually, a <b>jack</b> <b>snipe</b> was observed {{on the island}} in 2007.|$|E

50|$|Winter {{bird species}} seen include wigeon, teal, common snipe, <b>jack</b> <b>snipe,</b> goosander, and goldeneye. Water rail are seen more {{regularly}} in the winter with numbers going up to four individuals in 2013.|$|E
50|$|A split {{supercilium}} divides {{above the}} lores. In some species, {{such as the}} <b>jack</b> <b>snipe,</b> the divided stripes reconnect again behind the eye. In others, such as the broad-billed sandpiper, the divided stripes remain separate.|$|E
50|$|The <b>jack</b> <b>snipe</b> (Lymnocryptes minimus) {{is a small}} stocky wader. It is the {{smallest}} snipe, and {{the only member of}} the genus Lymnocryptes. Features such as its sternum make it quite distinct from other snipes or woodcocks.|$|E
50|$|Notable {{amongst the}} {{breeding}} birds are gadwall, shovellers, and reed, sedge, grasshopper and Cetti's warblers. Marsh harriers are regular visitors and occasionally breed. Migrants include <b>Jack</b> <b>snipe</b> and green sandpiper, and winter visitors include hen harriers and bearded tits.|$|E
50|$|The head {{pattern of}} <b>jack</b> <b>snipe</b> differs from common snipe {{and other species}} in the genus Gallinago, in {{that there is no}} central crown-stripe; instead, there are two pale lateral crown-stripes, which are {{separated}} from the supercilium by an area of dark plumage.|$|E
50|$|Berrow Marsh, {{contained}} within the dunes between the village and the beach, {{is a mixture of}} reedbed and salt marsh. Birds found here include many wetland species such as reed and sedge warbler and in winter occasional <b>jack</b> <b>snipe</b> amongst large numbers of common snipe.|$|E

50|$|Jack snipes are migratory, {{spending}} the non-breeding period in Great Britain, Atlantic and Mediterranean coastal Europe, Africa, and India. The <b>jack</b> <b>snipe</b> {{is one of}} the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. Their breeding habitat is marshes, bogs, tundra and wet meadows with short vegetation in northern Europe and northern Russia.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1860s, Jean Pierre Gueydan, {{the founder of}} the European-American town, lived in Abbeville, Louisiana, about 30 miles east of present-day Gueydan. As had the Attapaka and earlier American Indian tribes, he often came to this area to hunt deer, ducks, geese, pheasant, cache-cache (<b>jack</b> <b>snipe),</b> papabottes, and other game. The area was a hunter's paradise.|$|E

5000|$|This genus {{contains}} {{the majority of}} the world's snipe species, the other two extant genera being Coenocorypha, with three species, and Lymnocryptes, the <b>jack</b> <b>snipe.</b> Morphologically, they are all similar, with a very long slender bill and cryptic plumage. Most have distinctive displays, usually given at dawn or dusk. They search for invertebrates in the mud with a [...] "sewing-machine" [...] action of their long bills.|$|E
50|$|The bay {{has been}} {{designated}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest and in 1994 it became a Local Nature Reserve because of its importance for wildlife. Many birds visit in winter and during migration including large numbers of wildfowl and waders such as wigeon which peak at over 3000 birds. Notable species include brent goose, <b>jack</b> <b>snipe,</b> spotted redshank and greenshank. terns roost {{at the mouth of}} the bay.|$|E
50|$|Several {{species of}} birds have been {{recorded}} and the common species include the striated heron and western reef heron. Other species that have been recorded include the little bittern, black bittern, red knot, <b>jack</b> <b>snipe</b> and pied avocet (on transient sandbanks). The sanctuary is also host to mudskippers, fiddler crabs and other mangrove habitat specialists. A species of crustacean Teleotanais indianis was described based on specimens obtained in the sanctuary.|$|E
50|$|The site is {{associated}} with a range of rare fauna, including woodlark and the silverstudded blue butterfly (Plebejus argus), both of which breed in the heathland area. The site is also home to the Devon carpet moth (Lampropteryx otregiata), which may be found only on this site within the whole of Berkshire; also the snipe and <b>jack</b> <b>snipe</b> visit the pools in winter, whilst siskins and redpolls have been recorded feeding in the alders.|$|E
50|$|Birds {{recorded}} {{at the site}} include: <b>jack</b> <b>snipe,</b> common snipe, grey heron, whooper swan, mute swan, teal, wigeon, goldeneye, tufted duck, mallard, coot, moorhen, buzzard, wren, coal tit, great tit, blue tit, long-tailed tit, treecreeper, great spotted woodpecker, song thrush, blackbird, robin, dunnock, chaffinch, jackdaw, carrion crow, sparrowhawk, water rail, redshank, pheasant, owls, grasshopper warbler and reed bunting. Other annimals are bats, deer, mice, otters, common frog, common toad, smooth and palmate newts and water vole.|$|E
50|$|The quarry is {{protected}} as a Site of Special Scientific Interest {{because it is}} important for Jurassic fossils, particularly crocodiles. Since quarrying ceased, the site has also become important for wildlife. Birds including turtle dove, little ringed plover, Cetti's warbler and peregrine falcon breed in the quarry. A lake has formed {{in the bottom of the}} quarry, attracting birds including green sandpiper, <b>jack</b> <b>snipe,</b> little grebe and common pochard to overwinter there. The site also attracts invertebrates including damselflies.|$|E
50|$|Carbrain {{contains}} ten {{residential areas}} (Carbrain 1, 2, 3 & 4, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14), four churches (Carbrain Baptist Church, Cumbernauld Free Church, Cumbernauld United Reformed Church and St. Joseph's), two pubs (The Twa Corbies and The <b>Jack</b> <b>Snipe),</b> several local shops located throughout the site, {{along with a}} number of community buildings like the Red Cross Centre. Carbrain is supposed to have the Town Centre as its focus, so there was thought to be no need for serious scale entertainment or grocery shops.|$|E
50|$|He was a Justice of the Peace, {{and later}} Deputy Lieutenant of Cornwall. He was elected a Member of the British Ornithologists' Union in 1904. A friend, Edward Rodd, in his annual {{report to the}} Royal Institution of Cornwall records the number of birds shot by Lt Smith-Dorrien-Smith during the Isles of Scilly {{shooting}} season. These were 545 common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), 415 Eurasian woodcock (Scolopax rusticola) and 42 <b>jack</b> <b>snipe</b> (Lymnocryptes minimus). Rodd also received an immature purple heron (Ardea purpurea) and a wood sandpiper (Tringa glareola) for his collection.|$|E
50|$|The site {{supports}} valley mire {{surrounded by}} wet heath, this changes to dry acid heath as you progress {{up the valley}} sides. The site supports plenty of rare species such the silver studded blue butterfly, the marsh gentian {{and a variety of}} orchids. Reptiles including adder, grass snake, slowworm and lizards are regularly seen in the summer. Other regular wildlife visitors include red deer, roe deer and muntjac, barn owls are regularly seen hunting over the site and other bird species of interest include crossbills, <b>jack</b> <b>snipe</b> and turtle dove.|$|E
5000|$|The sound made by Gallinago snipes {{has been}} {{variously}} described as [...] "drumming", [...] "bleating", [...] "throbbing", a [...] "rattle" [...] and an [...] "eerie fluting". The drumming of the <b>jack</b> <b>snipe</b> (Limnocryptes minimus) has been likened {{to the sound}} made by a cantering or galloping horse. Miskelly records Coenocorypha snipes giving a non-vocal “roar” homologous to the drumming displays of Gallinago snipes, a sound formerly ascribed to a mythological bird, the hakawai. When breeding in northern Japan, Latham's snipe (Gallinago hardwickii) are known as “thunder birds” for the drumming noise made {{in the course of}} their display flights.|$|E
50|$|Waders {{found on}} the beach include {{sanderling}} (Calidris alba), dunlin (Calidris alpina), ringed plover, and oystercatchers are {{found on the}} neighbouring beach park. Brent goose, little stint, and golden plover are sometimes seen. The strandline on the shore contains marine invertebrates, which is a food source for flocks of twite (Carduelis flavirostris), linnet (Carduelis cannabina), pied wagtail (Motacilla alba yarrellii), and, occasionally, snow bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis). Eurasian skylark (Alauda arvensis) and meadow pipit (Anthus pratensis) are likely sightings and ravens (Corvus corax) are sometimes seen. Common snipe and <b>jack</b> <b>snipe</b> were both recorded at the site in 2014. Rooks are common and great black-backed gulls are seen {{in addition to the}} black-headed and herring gulls.|$|E
