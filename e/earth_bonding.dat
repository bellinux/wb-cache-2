The Type C construction of FIBCs requires that these threads be bonded to earth. It {{is not easy to}} feel confident in achieving this over extended operating lifetimes. There is the view that the Type D construction, which does not require <b>earth</b> <b>bonding,</b> can be acceptable. Critical aspects in the design of unearthed Type D bags are whether an electrostatic discharge to a bag containing charged material can get rapid access to sufficient electrostatic energy to provide a source of ignition of any flammable materials nearby (gases or dusts). The charge to feed an electrostatic discharge could come from material within the bag, but more probably from the outer bag surface. Charge on the outer surface of the bag will probably prevent any significant electrostatic discharges from within the bag. The prime concern is hence with charge on the outer surface. If the bag surface is a good quality insulating material then an initial discharge to an earthed probe approaching the charged bag will spread outwards over the charged surface until the radial electric field {{at the edge of the}} discharge can no longer support further propagation.

The aim of this work was to reveal structural motifs present during the fabrication of thin films by plasma deposition techniques as such knowledge is important for the optimization of thin film growth. METHODS: The formation of clusters in plasma plume from different concentrations of erbium-doped Ga 5 Ge 20 Sb 10 S 65 glasses (0. 05, 0. 1, and 0. 5 wt. % of erbium) using laser (337 nm) desorption ionization (LDI) was studied by time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF MS) in both positive and negative ion mode. The stoichiometry of the Gam Gen Sbo Sp (+/-) clusters was determined via isotopic envelope analysis and computer modelling. RESULTS: Several Gam Gen Sbo Sp (+/-) singly charged clusters were found but, surprisingly, only four species (Sb 3 S 4 (+/-), GaSb 2 Sp (+/-) (p = 4, 5), Ga 3 Sb 2 S 7 (+/-)) were common to both ion modes. For the first time, species containing rare earths (GaSb 2 SEr(+) and GaS 6 Er 2 (+)) were identified in the plasma formed from rare earth-doped chalcogenide glasses, directly confirming the importance of gallium presence for rare <b>earth</b> <b>bonding</b> within the glassy matrix. CONCLUSIONS: The local structure of Ga-Ge-Sb-S glasses is at least partly different from the structure of species identified in plasma by mass spectrometry, as deduced from Raman scattering spectroscopy analysis; these glasses are mainly formed by [GeS 4 / 2]/[GaS 4 / 2] tetrahedra and [SbS 3 / 2] pyramids. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure measurements show that Er(3 +) ions in Ga-Ge-Sb-S glasses are surrounded by 7 sulphur atoms. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E

Various governments and agencies have developed stringent requirements for electrical products that are sold world-wide. In most markets it is mandatory for a product to conform to safety standards promulgated by safety and standard agencies such as UL, CE, VDE, CSA, BSI, CCC and so on. To conform to such standards, the product must pass safety tests such as the high voltage test (also called as Dielectric voltage-withstand test or high potential test), Insulation Resistance Test, Ground (<b>Earth)</b> <b>Bond</b> & Ground Continuity Test & Leakage Current Test (also called as Line Leakage Test, Earth Leakage Current Test, Enclosure Leakage Current Test or Patient Leakage Current Test).

The photometric ratio of the dark (earthshine) to the bright (moonshine) sides of the Moon is used to determine nightly anomalies in the terrestrial albedo, with the aim is of quantifying sustained monthly, annual and/or decadal changes. We find two modest decadal scale cycles in the albedo, but with no significant net change over the sixteen years of accumulated data.

Indeed this has drawn the attention of many environmental researchers who have been attempting through various mean to expunging mercury from these contaminated medium. Biological approach provided a satisfactory outcome in the clean-up of mercury contaminated soil and water due to its high potential for greater performance, environment friendliness and cost effectiveness. Mercuryresistant bacterial strain (P. putida ATCC 49128), was experimented on its potential to grow and reduce mercury to a permissible level under optimum conditions of nutrient, pH and other related physical factors in an incubator shake flask. It was observed that P. putida displayed a usual growth pattern when tried at low level mercury concentration of 1. 0 µM, 6. 0 µM and 19. 0 µM, by exponentially growing during the first 4 hours of inoculation, but drastically decreased by the end of 24 hours’ time. This was indicated by the mercury removal rate of 99. 0 %, 99. 83 % and 98. 58 % in the three mercury concentrations used. Also, under the same optimum condition of growth, mercury concentration of 1000 µM was reduced by 92. 0 % after the first initial 1 hour to 98. 0 % at the end of 28 hour study. Comparably, similar trend was also observed when P. putida was used as bioaugmented organism to treat mercury contaminated samples from two petroleum industry based wastewater. A reduction rate of 84 % was observed at the initial first 4 hours to about 90. 5 % after 96 hour experiment for plant P 1 wastewater. While results from wastewater plant P 2 indicated reduction rate of 97. 2 %, followed by 94. 09 % and lastly 56. 8 % respectively.
