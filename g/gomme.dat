5|$|The {{theory that}} the song refers to the burying, perhaps alive, of {{children}} in the foundations of the bridge was first advanced by Alice Bertha <b>Gomme</b> (later Lady <b>Gomme)</b> in The Traditional Games of England, Scotland and Ireland (1894–1898) and perpetuated by the usually sceptical Iona and Peter Opie. This was based around the idea that a bridge would collapse unless the body of a human sacrifice were buried in its foundations and that the watchman is actually a human sacrifice, who will then watch over the bridge. However, there is no archaeological evidence for any human remains in the foundations of London Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Alcibiades first rose to {{prominence}} {{when he began}} advocating aggressive Athenian action after {{the signing of the}} Peace of Nicias. That treaty, an uneasy truce between Sparta and Athens signed midway through the Peloponnesian War, came at the end of seven years of fighting during which neither side had gained a decisive advantage. Historians Arnold W. <b>Gomme</b> and Raphael Sealey believe, and Thucydides reports, that Alcibiades was offended that the Spartans had negotiated that treaty through Nicias and Laches, overlooking him on account of his youth.|$|E

5|$|The Royalists {{occupied}} the low-lying moor, behind a drainage ditch that Rupert noted {{as an effective}} obstacle to a cavalry charge. There is some dispute {{over the course of}} the ditch at the time of the battle. Some contemporary accounts support the contention by later historians that it was non-existent on the Royalists' right wing. On the other hand, a near-contemporary plan of the Royalist dispositions by Rupert's chief engineer, Bernard de <b>Gomme,</b> shows the ditch in its present-day alignment. It is generally accepted that the ditch was at least less of an obstacle on the Royalist right.|$|E
5|$|After Charles II was {{restored}} to the throne in 1660, he began a wide-ranging programme of work on the coastal defences. The Dutch fleet then attacked up the Thames in June 1667, but were deterred from going further for fear of the Tilbury and Gravesend fortifications. In reality, the forts were poorly prepared to resist a Dutch attack; at Tilbury {{there were only two}} guns ready for action. The Dutch struck the English fleet at Medway instead, giving enough time for the government to improve the defences along the Thames and mount 80 guns on the forts. In the wake of the conflict, the King instructed his Chief Engineer, a Dutchman called Sir Bernard de <b>Gomme,</b> to develop Tilbury Fort's defences further.|$|E
5|$|The castle was {{primarily}} {{used as a}} prison during the interregnum and {{the early days of}} the Restoration. Concerns about a potential Dutch attack grew, however, and in 1665 King Charles II commissioned his Dutch-born master engineer, Sir Bernard de <b>Gomme,</b> to carry out a major scheme to improve the defences of Portsmouth, including Southsea Castle. Funding and poor organisation meant that the work did not begin until the 1680s. It included constructed an earthwork glacis around the castle; a new castle gate; four projecting turrets; and a redesign of the central keep. A large, stone plaque above the gatehouse entrance, bearing Charles' coat of arms, is dated 1683.|$|E

50|$|The sheer {{manpower}} {{required by}} de <b>Gomme's</b> defences meant that after about 1730 the double moat system used around Portsmouth was abandoned with the outer moat being filled in.|$|R
5|$|De <b>Gomme</b> {{prepared}} several {{plans for}} the King in 1665; a further iteration of the designs was submitted in 1670 and given royal approval. Work began the same year but it took until 1685 to complete the project. The work {{was carried out by}} skilled contractors, who were supplemented by large teams of pressed men brought in from across the region; during 1671, up to 256 workers were employed on the site. Around 3,000 timber piles had to be brought from Norway for the project in 1671 to support the foundations in the marshy ground. The resources needed for the King's multiple defence projects became stretched, and one of the planned bastions at Tilbury, originally planned to face the river, was cancelled in 1681, in part to save money. The total cost of the project is unknown, but was significantly more than the original estimate of £47,000.|$|E
5|$|The castle was {{expanded}} in the 1680s by Sir Bernard de <b>Gomme</b> and, {{after a period}} of neglect in the 18th century, was redesigned again in 1814 during the Napoleonic Wars. After a brief period of use as a military prison in the 1840s, the fortification {{was expanded}} in the 1850s and 1860s with additional gun batteries on the east and west sides. The defences were upgraded throughout the century due to the fears of a French invasion and formed part of the plan for defending Portsmouth during the First World War. In the interwar years some of the fortifications were stood down, but the castle saw service again in the Second World War, when it was involved in Operation Grasp, the seizure of French naval vessels in Portsmouth harbour. In 1960, Southsea Castle, by now obsolete, was sold to Portsmouth City Council. It was restored to its pre-1850 appearance and opened as a tourist attraction, receiving over 90,000 visitors from 2011–12.|$|E
5|$|Tilbury Fort, {{also known}} {{historically}} as the Thermitage Bulwark and the West Tilbury Blockhouse, is an artillery fort {{on the north}} bank of the River Thames in England. The earliest version of the fort, comprising a small blockhouse with artillery covering the river, was constructed by King Henry VIII to protect London against attack from France {{as part of his}} Device programme. It was reinforced during the 1588 Spanish Armada invasion scare, after which it was reinforced with earthwork bastion, and Parliamentary forces used it to help secure the capital during the English Civil War of the 1640s. Following naval raids during the Anglo-Dutch Wars, the fort was enlarged by Sir Bernard de <b>Gomme</b> from 1670 onwards to form a star-shaped defensive work, with angular bastions, water-filled moats and two lines of guns facing onto the river.|$|E

30|$|A common {{assumption}} {{and perhaps}} quite problematic to crop insurance design is {{the reliance on}} a single weather station representing an area of 20 – 25  km radius (<b>Gommes</b> and Gobel 2013). Households and villages within this radius {{are expected to have}} homogenous topography and farming systems. However, this simplified assumption of homogeneity of farming systems in index development is problematic for countries with variable topography, soil conditions and more diverse agro-ecologies (<b>Gommes</b> and Gobel 2013). On the other hand, indices such as area yield index (Mahul et al. 2012) developed based on historical average yields for a given area and vegetation index (Turvey and Mclaurin 2012) developed using satellite images have important limitations. For example, average yields may not work when the production conditions are heterogeneous or satellite-based vegetation cover may not differentiate different stresses. However, recent advances in satellite technologies are believed to correct these imperfections (Barrett et al. 2012; Leblois and Quirion 2011) although its cost-effectiveness, correlation with the underlying production risk and ability to discriminate different crops will need to be tested.|$|R
30|$|MICP {{data can}} also be used with Hager’s (1998) method to {{estimate}} effective tortuosity values, which characterize the convoluted pathways of fluid flow through porous systems (e.g., Epstein 1989; Hu and Wang 2003; <b>Gommes</b> et al. 2009). Following <b>Gommes</b> et al. (2009) approach (Eq.  2) of relating geometrical tortuosity to the travel paths that molecules will need to follow through a porous medium, the L e/L ratios for the American and Chinese shales are on the order of 2 – 11 (Table  2). These relatively large values of tortuosity imply that fluid within the tight shale formations will need to make its way through some tortuous pathways in order to migrate from one location to another. For example, a tortuosity L e/L of 11 for Longmaxi Formation sample means that it will take 11  cm for fluid to travel a linear distance of 1  cm in that formation. This is consistent with the findings from other approaches presented in this paper, which indicate that the nanopores of the tight shale formations are poorly connected so that fluids require much time to find connected pathways to travel a limited distance.|$|R
50|$|Robbe-Grillet {{wrote his}} first novel A Regicide (Un Régicide) in 1949, but it was {{rejected}} by Gallimard, a major French publishing house, and only later published with minor corrections by his lifelong publisher Les Éditions de Minuit in 1978. His second novel, The Erasers (Les <b>Gommes),</b> superficially resembles a detective novel, but it contains within it a deeper structure based on the tale of Oedipus. The detective is seeking the assassin in a murder {{that has not yet}} occurred, only to discover that it is his destiny to become that assassin.|$|R

25|$|Wycombe {{was once}} renowned for chairmaking the town's {{football}} team is nicknamed the 'Chairboys') and furniture design remains {{an important element}} of the town's university curriculum, Buckinghamshire New University. Among the best known furniture companies were Ercol and E <b>Gomme.</b> The River Wye runs through the valley, where beech trees were cut down by the chair industry to forming the town centre (circa 1700), with housing along the slopes (some areas are still surrounded by woods). The town was also home to the worldwide postage stamp and banknote printer Harrison and Sons. More recent industries in the town include the production of paper, precision instruments, clothing and plastics. Many of these are situated in an industrial area of the Cressex district, southwest of the town centre. The two largest sites belong to the companies Swan (tobacco papers, filters and matches) and Verco (office furniture), who until 2004 sponsored the local football team, Wycombe Wanderers.|$|E
