5|$|Additional {{construction}} costs meant the final total was £736,000, up from an original estimate of £235,000. The need for heating {{brought with it}} the requirement for boiler houses, plus additional foundations which were needed for the buildings {{to the north of}} the railway. Lieutenant J.G.N. Clifts of the Royal Engineers created the design for the site and buildings, and the contractor involved was a U.S. Army civil engineering company, appearing on records as American Construction Company. A temporary railway siding was created to aid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> building supplies. By 13 December 1918, several sheds had been completed, as were the Officers' Mess, sleeping quarters and the Navy and Army Canteen Board.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} on 27 June 1954, a CIA Lockheed P-38M Lightning {{attacked}} Puerto San José and dropped napalm bombs on the British cargo ship, , which was on charter to the U.S. company W.R. Grace and Company Line, and was being loaded with Guatemalan cotton and coffee. This incident cost the CIA one million U.S. dollars in compensation. On 22 June, another rebel plane bombed the Honduran town of San Pedro de Copán; John Dulles claimed the attack had been by the Guatemalan air force, thus avoiding diplomatic consequences. The handful of bombers that the rebel forces had begun with were shot down by the Guatemalan army within a few days, causing Castillo Armas to demand more from the CIA. Eisenhower quickly agreed to provide these additional planes, bolstering the rebel force. William Pawley had a crucial role to play <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> these aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} evening Hare took the stand to give evidence.

Although he was asked about other murders, he was not obliged to answer the questions, as the charge related only to the death of Docherty. After Hare's questioning, his wife entered the witness box, carrying their baby daughter who was suffering from whooping cough. Margaret used the child's coughing fits as a way to give herself thinking time for some of the questions, and told the court that she had a very poor memory and could not remember many of the events.|$|E

5|$|All four {{ships were}} laid down on 16 June 1909, {{but this was}} just a {{ceremonial}} event as actual work did not begin until September–October. One major complication was that the design for the turrets and their magazines was not completed when construction began so their weights and dimensions had to be estimated. The machinery for these ships was built by either the Baltic Works or the Franco-Russian Works as the New Admiralty Shipyard lacked its own engine shop. Construction was initially very slow because the Duma did not allocate any money for these ships until May 1911. Initial funding was taken from other budget items or the emperor's discretionary fund and the shipyards had to use their own money to keep the work going. They were enormously expensive with their cost estimated at 29.4 million rubles each, including armament. By way of comparison the preceding class of pre-dreadnoughts had only cost 11 million rubles each. Once the Duma provided the funding the pace of work accelerated and the ships were launched later that year, although delays <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> engines and turrets hindered their completion. All of the ships completed abbreviated trials by the end of 1914 and reached the fleet in December 1914 – January 1915.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{of three}} Kolkata-class ships was {{sanctioned by the}} Government of India in May 2000, and steel for the lead ship was cut in March 2003. Construction began in September 2003 at Mazagon Docks, Mumbai, with an initial {{expectation}} that {{the first of the}} class would be handed over to the navy by 2010. However, since then the Kolkata class has suffered consecutive delays, slow construction procedures and technical problems which saw the first ship of the class enter service during mid 2014. The delays in the construction programme have been attributed to persistent design changes made by the Indian Navy to incorporate new weapons systems and sensors, failure by a Ukrainian shipyard to deliver the ship's propellers and shafts and the contract later being awarded to a Russian firm, and finally the delay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> the Barak 8 anti-air missiles, which are still {{in the final stages of}} completion with Israel Aerospace Industries and the Defence Research and Development Organisation.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda's {{legal system}} is {{largely based on}} German and Belgian civil law systems and {{customary}} law. The judiciary is independent of the executive branch, although the President and the Senate {{are involved in the}} appointment of Supreme Court judges. Human Rights Watch have praised the Rwandan government for progress made <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> justice including the abolition of the death penalty, but also allege interference in the judicial system by members of the government, such as the politically motivated appointment of judges, misuse of prosecutorial power, and pressure on judges to make particular decisions. The constitution provides for two types of courts: ordinary and specialised. Ordinary courts are the Supreme Court, the High Court, and regional courts, while specialised courts are military courts and a system of commercial courts created in 2011 to expedite commercial litigations. Between 2004 and 2012, a system of Gacaca courts was in operation. Gacaca, a Rwandan traditional court operated by villages and communities, was revived to expedite the trials of genocide suspects. The court succeeded in clearing the backlog of genocide cases, but was criticised by human rights groups as not meeting legal fair standard.|$|E

5|$|The Factory No. 174 {{produced}} {{its last}} T-26 tanks in February 1941. After that, the factory began retooling {{to produce the}} new and much more complex T-50 light tank. This work was slowed by delays <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> new equipment and series production of the T-50 did not begin on schedule (planned for 1 June 1941). As a result, factory management decided to resume {{the production of the}} T-26, using T-26 hulls, turrets, and other parts already in stock. About 47 T-26 tanks were assembled and 77 were repaired in July–August 1941 before the factory was relocated from Leningrad to Chelyabinsk in the end of August 1941, and then to Chkalov in September 1941. The Factory No. 174 produced engines and spare parts for the T-26, installed additional armour plates on some T-26s, replaced flame-throwers with 45mm tank guns in turrets of 130 KhT-133 flame-throwing tanks, repaired tanks in army units (846 T-26s since the beginning of 1941) and mounted about 75 turrets from the T-26 and the T-50 as bunkers for the defence of Leningrad.|$|E
