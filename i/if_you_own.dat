500|$|Final Fantasy III Original Soundtrack {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics, with Patrick Gann declaring that [...] "even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>own</b> the original Famicom version's soundtrack, {{there is plenty}} of reason to own this soundtrack alongside it," [...] while Richard of Square Enix Music Online found it to be a [...] "passable" [...] album, but [...] "mostly forgettable".|$|E
500|$|Soul Reavers {{dark and}} gothic {{atmosphere}} was generally well-received, and several publications praised the game's cut scenes. IGN's reviewer called it [...] "such an ambitious game - {{and one that}} achieves nearly everything it sets out to do - that few games come close to it", and praised the soundtrack for blending with the atmosphere unobtrusively. The Dreamcast port was cited as [...] "perhaps {{one of the best}} looking console games ever made". Next Generation Magazine echoed this, stating that, [...] "even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>own</b> the PlayStation version, you may want to rent this anyway", but expressed disappointment that no new features were added to the Dreamcast port. AllGame's reviewer called the cut scenes [...] "seamless", and their frequency neither too high nor too low. The game's storyline was praised by Game Informer as being [...] "grim and interesting". Soul Reavers voice acting was also highly praised; GameSpot ranked this aspect of the game in its list of top ten [...] "Best Voice Acting in Games". GameSpot also considered the atmosphere as rich as that of Blood Omen, yet less dramatically overstated, and considered the graphics [...] "among the best that have ever been on the PlayStation." ...|$|E
500|$|... 1UP.com graded it A-, {{praising the}} {{gameplay}} and [...] "predictably slick" [...] looks, but criticized the [...] "divisive industrial hard-rock nonsense.... that sullied DMC3 [...] returns here" [...] and the game's [...] "overly frugal approach to level design". GameTrailers rated it an 8.6/10, and praised the voice acting while criticizing the corny dialogue. IGN gave it an 8.7 saying, [...] "Whether it's on the PS3 or the 360, action fans {{are going to}} get one incredible experience with this game, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>own</b> either system, you'll have a great time." [...] However, the review also noted that, contrary to Kobayashi's claim, [...] "Dante simply doesn't have nearly as many weapons as he did in DMC3" [...] and found that [...] "the amount of backtracking and repetition makes the game feel somewhat half-heartedly finished in the design department." [...] GameSpy gave it 4 stars out of 5, stating that [...] "DMC4 succeeds on many levels because it fuses fan service with entertaining gameplay", finding that [...] "visually, DMC4 is a dynamo." [...] The review also praised Nero for [...] " [...] something fresh to the franchise" [...] and being [...] "as diverse as DMC3 SE's Vergil"; however, they also claim that [...] "it cheapens things a little to see that the team has opted to recycle assets in lieu of showing us more of this rich world" [...] and call out the [...] "annoying industrial-meets-butt-rock soundtrack". Hypers Dirk Watch commends the game for [...] "looking great, combos galore and being more fun than Devil May Cry 3". However, he criticized it for [...] "still playing like Devil May Cry 2 as well as choppy pacing and level design".|$|E

500|$|Early {{versions}} featured simplified graphics, and {{the different}} ports were met with mixed reception. John Harris of Gamasutra thought the arcade's popularity fueled the sales of the home versions, while Thomas Hanley of ScrewAttack commented that most versions were not as enjoyable without a track ball. Grannell echoed similar statements about the controls and added that many had poor visuals and collision detection. He listed the Amiga, Game Boy, and Sega Mega Drive ports as the better conversions, and the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, PC, and Game Boy Advance versions among the worst. Compute! writers called the Amiga version's graphics and gameplay [...] "arcade-quality". Computer Gaming World stated that the Amiga version was superior to the arcade original. Bruce Webster of BYTE wrote that the graphics of the Amiga version of Marble Madness in December 1986 [...] "are really amazing". While criticizing {{the lack of a}} pause function or a top scores list, he stated that it [...] "is definitely worth having <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>own</b> an Amiga". Bil Herd recalled that the Amiga version was so popular at Commodore International that employees stole the required memory expansion from colleagues' computers to run the game. He wrote [...] "Not an Amiga" [...] on his Commodore 128D so others would not open it looking for Amiga memory. Info gave the Amiga version four-plus stars out of five, describing it as [...] "a totally faithful adaptation". It gave the Commodore 64 version three-plus stars out of five, describing it as [...] "just a shadow of the arcade original and the excellent Amiga version" [...] and inferior to Spindizzy. The magazine liked the graphics but criticized [...] "marbles that handle like intoxicated turtles". Dragons three reviewers—Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser—praised the Apple II port, calling it a [...] "must have" [...] title for arcade fans.|$|E

The celebrated architect of New York’s Central Park, Frederick Law Olmsted, was commissioned as the ‘landscape architect’ of the estate, designing the Italianate gardens that survive today. Olmsted also designed other Vanderbilt estates, including Biltmore.

The Clove chapel, with its small steeple intact, stood on Dutchess Route 9 about 3.7 miles north of Route 55. Our Lady of Mercy at Clove was still functioning in 1945 according to the parish calendar for that year, but closed shortly after World War II.|$|R
