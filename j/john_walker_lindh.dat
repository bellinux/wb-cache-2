Shortly after the battle, an {{embedded}} journalist working for CNN, Robert Young Pelton, managed to identify the badly injured and hypothermic Lindh as an American. Lindh was then separated from other prisoners and his life was saved by an American special forces medic. Lindh was later repatriated to the United States to face charges of treason. In 2002, he was found guilty of aiding and supporting the enemy and sentenced to 20 years in prison without parole.|$|E

2500|$|<b>John</b> Phillip <b>Walker</b> <b>Lindh</b> (born February 9, 1981) is a U.S. {{citizen who}} was {{captured}} {{as an enemy}} combatant during the United States' invasion of Afghanistan in November 2001. He was captured and detained at Qala-i-Jangi fortress, used as a prison. He {{took part in the}} Battle of Qala-i-Jangi, a violent uprising of the Taliban prisoners, during which the CIA officer Johnny [...] "Mike" [...] Spann was killed, together with all but 86 of the estimated 300–500 prisoners. Brought to trial in United States federal court in February 2002, Lindh accepted a plea bargain; he pleaded guilty to two charges and was sentenced to 20 years in prison without parole.|$|R

25|$|At that point, the Coalition forces assumed all of {{the prisoners}} are dead. In reality, however, well over 100 {{surviving}} prisoners had retreated to the basement dungeon of a central building, where they hid and were discovered only when they killed the body collectors who attempted to enter it. The fighting resumed. Northern Alliance fighters fired and threw in explosives into the basement, and even poured oil in and lit it on fire, but nevertheless the resistance continued. On November 28, General Dostum arrived and personally tried to persuade the last prisoners to surrender, to no effect. The next day, Dostum ordered the dungeon flooded with frigid irrigation water. This tactic worked and the last half-dead holdouts finally surrendered on December 1. Of the estimated 300–500 prisoners brought to the fortress, only 86 emerged still alive (some of whom later died of their wounds) from the flooded dungeon (where more than 60 of them had died), including <b>John</b> <b>Walker</b> <b>Lindh.</b> Some survivors later claimed they {{did not participate in}} the battle. One also told The Observer reporter Luke Harding that some wanted to surrender earlier, but a group of seven Arabs took control and did not let them.|$|E

2500|$|The word Taliban is Pashto, [...] , meaning [...] "students", {{the plural}} of ṭālib. This is a loanword from Arabic [...] , [...] using the Persian plural ending -ān [...] In Arabic [...] means not [...] "students" [...] but [...] "two students", {{as it is}} a [...] "dual form", the Arabic plural being [...] —occasionally causing some {{confusion}} to Arabic speakers. Since becoming a loanword in English, Taliban, besides a plural noun referring to the group, has also been used as a singular noun referring to an individual. For example, <b>John</b> <b>Walker</b> <b>Lindh</b> has been referred to as [...] "an American Taliban", rather than [...] "an American Talib". In the English language newspapers of Pakistan, the word Talibans is often used when referring to more than one Taliban. The spelling Taliban has come to be predominant over Taleban in English.|$|E
2500|$|On November 25, two CIA officers, Johnny [...] "Mike" [...] Spann {{from the}} highly secretive Special Activities Division, and Dave [...] "Dawson" [...] Tyson, an Uzbek speaker and region expert, arrived at Qala-i-Jangi {{to carry out}} {{prisoner}} interrogations in the fort's courtyard. The CIA officers questioned selected prisoners, especially one Sulayman al-Faris who was an American citizen born as <b>John</b> <b>Walker</b> <b>Lindh</b> (at the time, they noticed only that Lindh was a European-looking prisoner and different from the others, so he was singled out for an interrogation). Approximately two hours after the interviews began, a number of prisoners, some of them with concealed grenades, suddenly stood up and attacked their captors, who were outnumbered about four to one. Attacking in a suicidal manner, revolting prisoners overran and killed Spann and several Afghan guards; they also appeared to be often much better trained than their Northern Alliance captors, many of whom got shocked and frightened by their enemies' display of skill and fanaticism. The prisoners managed {{to take over the}} southern half of the fortress, including the armory and ammunition depot, seizing a large store of small arms, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, mortars and ammunition.|$|E
