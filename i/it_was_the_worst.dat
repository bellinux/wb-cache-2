5|$|The 1812 Louisiana Hurricane {{was a major}} {{hurricane}} {{that struck}} New Orleans, Louisiana, during the War of 1812. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> storm of {{the early history of}} New Orleans and was very likely the hurricane which made the closest landfall known to affect the city.|$|E
5|$|During Operation Red Wings on 28 June 2005, four Navy SEALs, {{pinned down}} in a firefight, radioed for help. A Chinook helicopter, {{carrying}} 16 service members, responded but was shot down. All members of the rescue team and three of four SEALs on the ground died. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> loss of life in Afghanistan since the invasion in 2001. The Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell alone survived. Team leader Michael P. Murphy was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in the battle.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, {{in the wake}} of the scandal, Waugh was widely jeered by an Australian crowd when he walked out to bat on the first day of the Test. In what he {{described}} as the toughest day of his career, Waugh gave an unconvincing and hesitant performance. Waugh managed only seven runs in 36 minutes before being removed by Peter Such, caught and bowled. The cricket writer Peter Roebuck opined that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> home crowd reception for an Australian player that he could remember. Warne was injured at the time and did not play, so he did not have to face the hostile crowd.|$|E

5|$|Early {{use of the}} NS-10 among {{engineers}} include Bob Clearmountain, Rhett Davies, and Bill Scheniman in the US, and Nigel Jopson in the UK. Clearmountain, then {{a rising}} star in record production, is often credited for {{the popularity of the}} NS-10; Phil Ward, writing in Sound on Sound, suggested that Clearmountain was probably not the earliest, but was certainly the most influential early adopter. It became a legend that Clearmountain had chosen it because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> speaker he could find. He was one of a new breed of creative freelance recording engineers and producers who would travel from studio to studio equipped with their own gear that included microphones, and a pair of Yamaha NS-10, as a reference.|$|E
5|$|On December 29, 1876, {{a bridge}} over Ohio's Ashtabula River collapsed. The bridge {{had been built}} from metal cast at one of Stone's mills, and was {{carrying}} a train {{owned and operated by}} Stone's Lake Shore and Michigan Railway. Ninety-two people died; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> rail disaster in American history up to that point. Blame fell heavily on Stone, who departed for Europe to recuperate and left Hay in charge of his businesses. The summer of 1877 was marked by labor disputes; a strike over wage cuts on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad soon spread to the Lake Shore, much to Hay's outrage. He blamed foreign agitators for the dispute, and vented his anger over the strike in his only novel, The Bread-Winners (1883).|$|E
5|$|The 1885 season brought Navy's overall win–loss {{record to}} an even 3–3–1. It also brought the Academy's record against Johns Hopkins to 2–2 tie. The season {{marked the first time}} a team for the Naval Academy would play a multiple-game season. In 1886, their {{schedule}} was expanded from three games to five, and continued to grow through subsequent years. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> single-season record for the Academy until 1888, when they went 1–4. Navy would finish the 1880s with four winning seasons, and an overall record of 14–12–2. The school would outscore their opponents 292–231, and would finish the 19th century with an overall record of 54–19–3.|$|E

5|$|The {{season began}} with Subtropical Storm Ana on April 20, {{prior to the}} {{official}} start of the season; the bounds of the season are from June 1 to November 30, which conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. In early September, Hurricane Fabian struck Bermuda as a Category 3 hurricane, where <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> hurricane since 1926; on the island it caused four deaths and $300million in damage (2003USD, $ USD). Hurricane Juan caused considerable destruction to Nova Scotia, particularly Halifax, as a Category2 hurricane, the first hurricane of significant strength to hit the province since 1893. Additionally, Hurricanes Claudette and Erika struck Texas and Mexico, respectively, as minimal hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|Following this, the 15th Battalion {{moved to}} Mouquet Farm, where they {{supported}} {{an attack by}} the 14th Battalion and carried out defensive duties. They remained there until early September, when they were withdrawn back to Warloy and then to Reingheist, via Doulens. Before this occurred, on 30 August, the 15th experienced a change in command, as Cannan, who had been promoted to brigadier-general, was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Terence McSharry. The remainder {{of the year was}} spent in the Ypres salient, around St Eloi and Boorlartbeek, before winter fell on the Western Front. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> winter in Europe in 40 years, and the men suffered heavily from sickness and the cold as they rotated through the line, conducting defensive duties and labouring before moving to Gueudecourt, and then later Lagnicourt, in the new year.|$|E
5|$|On 14 October 1322, the English {{army was}} routed by the Scots, {{under the command}} of Robert the Bruce, at the Battle of Old Byland in Yorkshire. The English commander, John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond, was taken prisoner, while the king himself barely escaped capture. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> defeat the English had {{suffered}} in the wars since the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Harclay had received a summons to join the royal army, but {{had not been able to}} bring his troops south in time to come to the king's rescue. The event convinced him that the war against Scotland could not be won under the leadership of the present king. Instead he entered into direct negotiations with the Scots, without the king's sanction. On 3 January 1323, he signed a peace treaty with Robert the Bruce at Lochmaben.|$|E

5|$|Aldridge {{also started}} the seventh game on October 15. It had been raining {{for a week}} in Pittsburgh, and the sixth game had been rainy. The weather for the seventh was even worse, and the game was played in thick pea soup fog and drizzle, with a very wet {{pitching}} mound. It was hoped that Aldridge would continue his success {{in the first two}} games to the seventh, but it was not to be. Although noted for his consistency, in this game Aldridge was very wild; he had had only two days rest and he kept slipping on the slick pitcher's plate. Sam Rice was the first batter, and he hit a single. Then Bucky Harris came out, whose fly out was the only success Aldridge had during the game. Goose Goslin was walked after a wild pitch. Joe Harris was walked after a wild pitch advanced the baserunners. After a full count, Joe Judge was walked, scoring in one run. Then Ossie Bluege hit a single. Pirates manager Bill McKechnie had seen enough and relieved Aldridge. In total, Aldridge gave up three walks, two hits and two wild pitches, resulting in the Senators having a 4–0 lead in the first inning. The Pirates would rally to win the game and the World Series by a score of 9–7, the first time a team won the World Series after a 3–1 deficit. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> start of the seventh game for a pitcher in Series history.|$|E
5|$|During {{its debut}} week, Dragon Quest X topped Japanese gaming charts, selling 367,000 units. While this {{was seen as}} an {{impressive}} debut for an MMORPG in Japan, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> sales debut of a mainline Dragon Quest game in recent years. Despite sales being low when compared to other entries, it succeeded in tripling sales for its console to 41,000 after a significant decline. By the end of August 2012, Dragon Quest X had sold 557,000 units, with Square Enix taking a 26% share of total game sales for the month after Nintendo. By November, Square Enix had shipped 700,000 units. It was ranked as the 10th best-selling titles of 2012, with 609,783 units. In its first week on sale, the Wii U version of the game sold 33,302 units, coming in at #6 on Japanese charts. The 3DS version also sold well, selling through over 95% of its shipment with 52,375 units. At release, the game's first expansion sold 117,000 units on Wii, reaching #2 in the charts. The Wii U version reached #6 with sales of 71,000 units. The third expansion's Wii U version debuted at #2 with 99,000, coming ahead of Xenoblade Chronicles X.
