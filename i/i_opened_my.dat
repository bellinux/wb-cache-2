500|$|Not {{only did}} the horse survive near-death in 2008, so did Kathy Ritvo, who had a heart {{transplant}} in November 2008. She was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in 2001, limiting her horse training career. [...] By 2008 her condition deteriorated {{to the point where}} she was hospitalized for several months, and she was near death when an organ became available. [...] Less than six months after transplant surgery, she returned to training race horses. [...] In a 2011 interview, she compared her own rapid recovery to the spontaneous recovery of the horse as a foal, and stated, [...] "from the moment <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> eyes , I felt fantastic.

By the end of the film they realize the person lying on the floor is not dead and he is the reason they are locked in the room. Whannell initially did not give Wan the reaction he was looking for. He said, [...] "I'll never forget that day. I remember hanging up the phone and started just going over it in my head, and without any sort of long period of pondering, <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> diary that I had at the time and wrote the word 'Saw'." [...] Before instantaneously writing the word [...] "Saw" [...] in a blood-red, dripping font, the two had not come up with a title. [...] "It was one of those moments that made me aware that some things just really are meant to be. Some things are just waiting there to be discovered," [...] Whannell said.|$|E

500|$|Thunderball was {{the third}} James Bond score {{composed}} by John Barry, after From Russia with Love and Goldfinger. The original title song was entitled [...] "Mr. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang", taken from an Italian journalist who in 1962 dubbed agent 007 as Mr. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang. The title theme was written by Barry and Leslie Bricusse; the song was originally recorded by Shirley Bassey, and later rerecorded by Dionne Warwick, whose version was not released until the 1990s. The song {{was removed from the}} title credits after producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman were worried that a theme song to a James Bond film would not work well if the song did not have the title of the film in its lyrics. Barry then teamed up with lyricist Don Black and wrote [...] "Thunderball", which was sung by Tom Jones, who according to Bond production legend, fainted in the recording booth when singing the song's final note. Jones said of it, [...] "I closed my eyes and I held the note for so long when <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> eyes the room was spinning." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of MDNA, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph gave a mixed to {{positive}} review, praising its dance-friendly nature, but calling the lyrics banal.

Is it about her doomed relationship with Guy Ritchie? Who knows? Who cares?". Matthew Parpetua from Pitchfork Media criticized Solveig's [...] "unimaginative arrangements". Sian Rowe from NME found the track to be [...] "flat", this view was also shared by Alex Macpherson from Fact magazine. Robert Leedham from Drowned in Sound website called the song [...] "mediocre", describing it as [...] "synth-flavoured filler of the garden variety". Jon Pareles from The New York Times called it shallow, effective club fodder, describing it as containing [...] "blippy stereo-hopping synthesizers and generic title". This was shared by Emily Mackay of The Quietus, feeling that the song {{would have been better}} off for other artist and was below Madonna's level.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, {{starting}} {{horses in}} 53 races for the year, she also {{took over the}} training of then-two-year-old Mucho Macho Man when her husband Tim stopped training horses because he began working {{as part of the}} management at Gulfstream Park. [...] Working with owners Reeves Thoroughbred Racing, the horse ran in the 2011 Kentucky Derby. Ritvo was only the 14th woman to train a horse entered in the Kentucky Derby in the 137 years it had been run to that date, and the third-place finish of the horse was the best for a woman trainer {{in the history of the}} race. [...] She kept her perspective: [...] "I'm so proud to be in the Derby, but just to get up in the morning is amazing." [...] She next ran Mucho Macho Man in the other two legs of the Triple Crown, the 136th Preakness Stakes and the 143rd Belmont Stakes, where he finished sixth and seventh respectively. Only 13 women trainers had saddled a starter prior to the 2011 Preakness, and Ritvo was only the 10th woman trainer to start a horse in the Belmont. [...] Mucho Macho Man had overcome his own health problems in order to race, including having appeared to be lifeless at birth. Comparing her own experiences to the horse, Ritvo stated, [...] "From the moment <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> eyes, I felt fantastic. He's Mucho Macho Man and I'm Macho Woman." ...|$|E

On 1 May Darwin replied, agreeing with Wallace's 1855 paper [...] "On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species": [...] "I can see that we have thought much alike & to a certain extent have come to similar conclusions. ... This summer will make the 20th year (!) since <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> first-note-book, on the question how & in what way do species & varieties differ from each other.— I am now preparing my work for publication, but I find the subject so very large, that though I have written many chapters, I do not suppose I shall go to press for two years." [...] He agreed with Wallace that [...] "climatal conditions" [...] had little effect, and wrote [...] "It is really impossible to explain my views in the compass of a letter on the causes & means of variation in a state of nature; but I have slowly adopted a distinct & tangible idea.— Whether true or false others must judge".|$|E

2500|$|He also {{performed}} in the 2007 WOMAD (World of Music, Arts and Dance) festival concert, and in reviewing his performance BBC Radio referred to his voice as [...] "sensational". D'Or described an experience that he had singing at the festival as follows: [...] "I had a concert in the Canary Islands...in the WOMAD Festival in front of something like 20,000 people, and then I saw {{just in front of}} me, a group of Palestinian young people with a huge Palestinian flag. And at the beginning I was very tense because I didn't know what their intentions were. I closed my eyes and said 'Look, you speak always about the power of music and how music can get people close to each other', and I was like aiming to their heart, and I'm singing especially for them, and then when <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> eyes and I saw those people dancing with the Palestinian flag and singing with me together, and it was for me like an amazing sight, because this is something that I don't think ever happened before. I don't know why this world...is choosing...always...war and hate, because things are much easier to solve if you just want to solve them, that's what I feel. And maybe it's naïve, but this is my belief." ...|$|E
2500|$|Therefore, I beseeched the Lord {{to teach}} me His statutes. After my prayer as usual <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> Bible with closed eyes and {{put my finger on}} the right place. For the first time I opened Revelation 1:3"Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand." [...] I asked the Lord: [...] "O Lord! What about until then?" [...] And again I opened the Bible, that time on 1 Timothy 1:15"This is a {{faithful}} saying, and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief." [...] And for the third time I tempted the Lord, saying: [...] "O Lord! I am not an Abraham nor a Jew, I'm a sinner, but involve me to understand Your Will." [...] And then I opened the Book of SirahJoshua 24:29-30, where I read in the new American Translation: [...] "Said to myself, I will water my plants, my flower bed I will drench; and suddenly this rivulet of mine became a river, then this stream of mine, a sea. Thus do I send my teaching forth shining like a dawn, to become known afar off. Thus do I pour out instruction like prophecy and bestow it on generations to come." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though {{he began}} his mission around 1900, he {{continued}} to have other business interests as well. [...] One of those interests was gold mining. [...] In 1897, the Los Angeles Times published an article on Yoakum's claim that he had discovered a new method of [...] "X-Ray Prospecting" [...] for gold. [...] Yoakum {{reported that he had}} laid [...] a bit of gold-bearing quartz on the x-ray plate while taking an x-ray of a patient with a tumor. [...] The x-ray showed the location of the gold deposits in the quartz, and Yoakum proposed using x-rays in mine tunnels to [...] "ascertain decisively if gold is present, and if so, exactly where it lies and in what quantities." [...] Following this report, Yoakum became active in gold and copper mining. [...] In 1902, he ran a newspaper advertisement (pictured at left) offering stock at 25 cents a share in his new mining company. Yoakum later claimed that it was while traveling in Mexico, the location of his mining interests, that he spoke {{for the first time in}} [...] "tongues." [...] He reported: [...] "I was in the heart of Mexico in a church, speaking through an interpreter to the Mexicans and Indians, when suddenly a distinct rush of some might wind came upon me, and when <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> mouth it was not English, but a beautiful smooth Castilian language, and for 20 or 30 minutes I held that large audience." ...|$|E
