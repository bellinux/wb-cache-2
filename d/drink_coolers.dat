For instance, Citizens Bank Park has Philadelphia-style food stands, including several which serve cheesesteaks, hoagies, and other regional specialties. Busch Stadium includes standard ballpark fare like bratwurst, nachos and peanuts, but also has St. Louis-area favorites such as pork steak sandwiches and toasted ravioli; uniquely Busch Stadium also allows outside food and drink (including soft-sided <b>drink</b> <b>coolers).</b>|$|E

40|$|Many {{argue that}} alcoholic-beverage {{producers}} target young people – including underage persons – with their advertising. Industry needs to recruit {{the next generation}} of heavy drinkers to maintain and expand profits. Evidence shows that young adults who begin to drink at an early age have higher chances of becoming dependent on alcohol. Since the alcoholicbeverage industry relies heavily for sales from those heavy drinkers, it has little incentive to prevent the early onset of underage alcohol consumption. Heavy drinkers support the industry: • The top 20 % of alcohol consumers account for about 87 - 89 % of all of the alcohol consumed in the U. S. 1 Beer consumption accounts for 81 % of the alcohol consumed in hazardous amounts (defined as five or more drinks per day) in the U. S. 2 Youthful market: • Young adults aged 18 - 29 account for 45 % of total alcohol consumption. 3 • In 2001, 50. 3 % of students in grades 9 - 12 consumed beer, 48. 1 % drank liquor, and 48. 8 % <b>drank</b> wine <b>coolers.</b> 4 • Youth between the ages of 12 and 20 consume almost 20 % {{of the total number of}} drinks consumed per month. 5 • 18 - 25 year-olds binge drink at the highest rates (38. 7 %), peaking at age 21 (48. 2 %). Heavy drinking also peaks at age 21 (17. 8 %). ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the impact of gender on alcohol use among African-American college students. The two study hypotheses were: (1) {{there is no difference}} between the rates of alcohol use for African-American males and African-American females; and (2) there is no difference in alcohol use among African-American college students according to social variables, i. e., personal and situational variables. The Clark Atlanta University survey of Alcohol Use (1992) was used to assess the drinking patterns of a select group of African-American college students. The participants in this study consisted of 128 African-American college students (males and females) who attended schools in the Atlanta University Center. Results indicated that, contrary to the expected predictions, the rate of alcohol use tended to be higher for African-American females than for African-American males, however, this difference was not significant. Furthermore, influences of social variables i. e., place, type of consumption, reasons for drinking and group composition, appeared to be significant when looking at the gender differences. It was concluded that type of consumption tended to be significant, e. g., African-American college females, who reported that they used alcohol, indicated that they prefer to <b>drink</b> wine <b>coolers</b> when they consume alcohol. The African-American college males indicated that they prefer to drink beer when they consume alcohol. The second most significant difference, between African-American college males and females, was their responses to alcohol consumption based upon group composition. It was revealed that African- American females, who reported consuming alcohol, preferred to drink with friends and same sex. However, when African -American college males responded to this question, they reported that they prefer to drink in the presence of large mixed groups more often...|$|R
