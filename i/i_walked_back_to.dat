60|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Branksome much {{disturbed}} by this interview, and extremely puzzled {{as to what}} course I should pursue.|$|E
60|$|Feeling {{that this}} woman had the better of it, with her calm, polished, highbred sarcasms, <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the 'pike, full of hopes of a sweet revenge.|$|E
60|$|I {{became aware}} of some one moving about in the passage, and went {{and shut the door}} of the room, then <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the {{hearthrug}} and turned.|$|E
60|$|In {{another moment}} <b>I</b> had <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the raft {{and lifted her}} as tenderly and reverently {{as if she had}} been my sister--indeed more so--in my arms.|$|R
60|$|Jerry was {{satisfied}} {{to act as}} sentinel, and <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> leisurely <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the shore, believing that much time must elapse before we would get the desired opportunity.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{must have}} done so in this case, for <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> nearly <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Blacktown, and should have found the package if it had fallen from my pocket." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{fellow was}} overdoing it a little, I thought; then, when I {{had seen him}} safely locked up for the night, <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the kitchen slowly and very thoughtfully.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my house. It {{was very}} silent, and as I passed {{up the stairs}} the {{servants}} shrunk back with averted faces, {{as if they were}} afraid to look at me.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the parade}} trying to reason my next step out, and muttering to myself, {{because there was}} {{something}} in that luminous wonderfulness that touched one's brain, and made one feel a little light-headed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} do it," [...] Bell replied. [...] "If I were taken over to Guestwick, I should be so uneasy that <b>I</b> should <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Allington the first moment that I could escape from the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's true {{enough for}} some of them; but {{what would you have}} me do? <b>I</b> couldn't <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Mohill by his horse's side;--and I tell you if they attack him at all, it will not be at the house there, but on his way home." ...|$|R
60|$|Thanking him, I groped my way {{downstairs and}} let myself {{out by a}} side door Monahan had shown me into an alleyway, thus {{avoiding}} the saloon. As <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> slowly <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the office, seeking {{the shade of the}} awnings, the figure in the darkened room took on a sinister aspect that troubled me....|$|R
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{our hotel}} with my nephew I passed my {{hand into his}} arm and put to him, by no {{roundabout}} approach, {{the question of whether}} he were in serious peril of love.|$|E
60|$|We {{found the}} boat {{hard and fast}} in the mud. Sam rowed me ashore. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> camp, and he stayed all night, and all the next day, waiting for the tide to float the boat.|$|E
6000|$|So Lady Delahaye {{drove away}} down the white dusty road, and <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the study from whence her coming had brought me. As I sat down to my {{interrupted}} work I smiled. How little she understood! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you have}} not made up your mind to take my advice by the time <b>I</b> have <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> that door," [...] she said, [...] "I will {{put it out of}} your power to set me at defiance. I am used to be obeyed, and I will be obeyed. You force me to use hard words. I warn you before it is too late. Go!" ...|$|R
60|$|Still {{no sign of}} the boy. Every {{few minutes}} <b>I</b> would <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the boat and linger beside it till I could no longer stand the mute reproach of the baskets huddled in a little pile on the stones, poor, {{houseless}} immigrants that they were. And from time to time I made a touching spectacle of myself, by pulling out my watch and peering, by what feeble light I could find, anxiously at its face to make out the hour.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{held out}} her ’and, and while the skipper was shaking it <b>I</b> began <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the wharf. <b>I</b> ’adn’t gorn far afore I heard ’im coming up behind me, and next moment ’e was walking {{alongside}} and saying things {{to try and make}} me lose my temper.|$|R
60|$|In {{the evening}} of that beatific day <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Edinburgh by some aërial and rose-clouded path not {{indicated}} on the maps. It led somehow to my lodgings, and my feet touched earth when the door was opened to me by Bethiah McRankine.|$|E
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Madame Bouvet's I {{made up my}} {{mind that}} there was but the one thing to do, to go at once to Monsieur de Saint-Gre's plantation. Finding Madame still waiting in the gallery, I asked her to direct me thither.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I met him on {{the road}} with Lady Hester Perrault, and I told them. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Spinney Lawn with them. But," [...] as I began to thank her, and her voice went lower still, [...] "but--oh, Ursula, Lady Hester knew it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I fancy that it {{has been}} open all night," [...] I declared, [...] "for {{to the best of my}} belief no one has passed through it save yourself. May <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> with you <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the house, Lady Angela? There is {{something}} which I should very much like to ask you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's no use {{thinking}} of princes," [...] she pursued {{as if she}} hadn't heard me. [...] "They're most of them more in want of money even than we. Therefore 'greatness' {{is out of the}} question--we really recognised that at an early stage. Your nephew's exactly the sort of young man we've always built upon--if he wasn't, so impossibly, your nephew. From head to foot he was made on purpose. Dear Linda was her mother's own daughter when she recognised him on the spot! One's enough of a prince to-day when one's the right American: such a wonderful price is set on one's not being the wrong! It does as well as anything and it's a great simplification. If you don't believe me go to London and see." [...] She had come with me out to the road. I had said <b>I</b> would <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Stresa and we stood there in the sweet dark warmth. As I took her hand, bidding her good-night, I couldn't but exhale a compassion. [...] "Poor Linda, poor Linda!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{the first}} round," [...] he pictured. [...] "Gong's sounded, an' we've shook hands. Of course, seein' as it's a long fight an' we've never {{seen each other}} in action, we ain't in no rush. We're just feelin' each other out an' fiddlin' around. Seventeen seconds like that. Not a blow struck. Nothin'. An' then it's all off with the big Swede. It takes some time to tell it, but it {{happened}} in a jiffy, in fess In {{a tenth of a}} second. I wasn't expectin' it myself. We're awful close together. His left glove ain't a foot from my jaw, an' my left glove ain't a foot from his. He feints with his right, an' I know it's a feint, an' just hunch up my left shoulder a bit an' feint with my right. That draws his guard over just about an inch, an' I see my openin'. My left ain't got a foot to travel. I don't draw it back none. I start it from where it is, corkscrewin' around his right guard an' pivotin' at the waist to put the weight of my shoulder into the punch. An' it connects!--Square on the point of the chin, sideways. He drops deado. <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my corner, an', honest to God, Saxon, I can't help gigglin' a little, it was that easy. The referee stands over 'm an' counts 'm out. He never quivers. The audience don't {{know what to make of}} it an' sits paralyzed. His seconds carry 'm to his corner an' set 'm on the stool. But they gotta hold 'm up. Five minutes afterward he opens his eyes--but he ain't seein' nothing. They're glassy. Five minutes more, an' he stands up. They got to help hold 'm, his legs givin' under 'm like they was sausages. An' the seconds has to help 'm through the ropes, an' they go down the aisle to his dressin' room a-helpin' 'm. An' the crowd beginning to yell fake an' want its money back. Twenty-seven seconds--one punch--n' a spankin' pair of horses for the best wife Billy Roberts ever had in his long experience." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the hotel, {{wondering}} how I could {{learn something about}} the Contessa Salvi-Scarabelli. In the doorway I found the innkeeper, and near him stood a young man whom I immediately perceived to be a compatriot, and with whom, apparently, {{he had been in}} conversation.|$|E
60|$|This story I {{would not}} have told, but that my whole life turned upon these accursed boots. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> school as proud as a peacock, and easily succeeded in {{satisfying}} the boys as to {{the manner in which}} I came by my new ornaments.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the office}} slowly, for I was in deep thought. For two years my uncle {{had been my}} guardian, {{and during that time}} my life had been little better than a continual hardship. The letter brought up the memory of the past, and I {{realized}} now more than ever how happy the days gone by had been. What had brought about the change? ...|$|E
50|$|At {{the very}} top of this room were all the ancient coins and paper money which was not so old. You could get into the main gallery from this room, but <b>I</b> {{preferred}} <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the passage and enter through two glass doors into a small room before going into the gallery because all the armour was here. Shields and swords were put up on the walls and chain gauntlets. When the film Rob Roy was on at the Allan Park Picture house, papa was given permission to supply the shields and swords for display at the entrance in the picture house. He was given free tickets for the film which we all enjoyed and also added to the history in the museum for us.|$|R
60|$|One {{morning in}} the late summer, while walking in the fields at my home in South America, I noticed a few purple martins, large, {{beautiful}} swallows common in that region, engaged, at a considerable height, in the aerial exercises in which they pass {{so much of their}} time each day. By and by, one of the birds separated itself from the others, and, circling slowly downward, finally alighted on the ground not far from me. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> on: but the action of the bird had struck me as unusual and strange, and before going far, <b>I</b> turned and <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the spot where it continued sitting on the ground, quite motionless. It made no movement when I approached to within four yards of it; and after I had stood still at that distance for a minute or so, attentively regarding it, I saw it put out one wing and turn over on its side. I at once took it up in my hand, and found that it was already quite dead. It was a large example of its species, and its size, together with a something of dimness in the glossy purple colour of the upper plumage, seemed to show that it was an old bird. But it was uninjured, and when I dissected it no trace of disease was discernible. I concluded that it was an old bird that had died solely from natural failure of the life-energy.|$|R
6000|$|The {{house had}} been closed and the {{establishment}} of servants had been dismissed {{for more than a year}} past. A passion for horse-racing, developed late in life, had ruined the rich retired tradesman who had purchased the estate at the time of our family troubles. He had gone abroad with his wife to live on the little income that had been saved from the wreck of his fortune; and he had left the house and lands in such a state of neglect that no new purchaser had thus far been found to take them. My old friend, [...] "now past his work," [...] had been put in charge of the place. As for Dermody's cottage, it was empty, like the house. I was at perfect liberty to look over it if I liked. There was the key of the door on the bunch with the others; and here was the old man, with his old hat on his head, ready to accompany me wherever I pleased to go. I declined to trouble him to accompany me or to make up a bed in the lonely house. The night was fine, the moon was rising. I had supped; I had rested. When I had seen what I wanted to see, <b>I</b> could easily <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the market-town and sleep at the inn. Taking the key in my hand, I set forth alone on the way through the grounds which led to Dermody's cottage.|$|R
60|$|It {{might have}} been the {{dropping}} of water from the cottage roofs while I passed through the village, or the groundless alarm of my own suspicious fancy, but I thought I was being followed as <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the inn. Two or three times I turned round abruptly. If twenty men had been at my heels, it was too dark to see them. I went on to the inn.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had heard}} a sort of croaking going on for some time, only I wouldn't take any notice; but then I {{got out of the}} boat and went up to him, with some water. His eyes were red--red and black and half out of his head. He drank all the water I gave him, but he hadn't much to say for himself. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the governor.|$|E
60|$|First I laughed, and then, {{seeing that}} {{she was about to}} throw herself for {{protection}} like a mountain of flesh upon me, I turned and ran after the snake--for I had observed that it belonged to a harmless species, one of the innocuous Coronella genus--and I was anxious to annoy the woman. I captured it in a moment; then, with the poor frightened creature struggling in my hand and winding itself about my wrist, <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her.|$|E
60|$|I {{began to}} {{question}} him, but he now appeared less inclined to talk and more frightened than ever, and each time I attempted to speak he imposed silence, with a quick gesture of alarm, while he continued to stare about him with dilated eyes. All at once he sprang to his feet as if overcome with terror and started running at full speed. His fear infected me, and, springing up, I followed as fast as I could, but he was far ahead of me, running for dear life; and before I had gone forty yards my feet were caught in a creeper trailing along the surface, and I measured my length on the ground. The sudden, violent shock almost took away my senses for a moment, but when I jumped up and stared round to see no unspeakable monster--Curupita or other--rushing on to slay and devour me there and then, I began to feel ashamed of my cowardice; {{and in the end}} <b>I</b> turned and <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the spot <b>I</b> had just quitted and sat down once more. I even tried to hum a tune, just to prove to myself that I had completely recovered from the panic caught from the miserable Indian; but it is never possible in such cases <b>to</b> get <b>back</b> one's serenity immediately, and a vague suspicion continued to trouble me for a time. After sitting there for half an hour or so, listening to distant bird-sounds, I began to recover my old confidence, and even to feel inclined to penetrate further into the wood. All at once, making me almost jump, so sudden it was, so much nearer and louder than I had ever heard it before, the mysterious melody began. Unmistakably it was uttered by the same being heard on former occasions; but today it was different in character. The utterance was far more rapid, with fewer silent intervals, and it had none of the usual tenderness in it, nor ever once sunk to that low, whisper-like talking which had seemed to me as if the spirit of the wind had breathed its low sighs in syllables and speech. Now it was not only loud, rapid, and continuous, but, while still musical, there was an incisiveness in it, a sharp ring as of resentment, which made it strike painfully on the sense.|$|R

60|$|I {{remember}} how, {{after our}} third bout of talking, <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> {{through the streets}} of Utopian London to rejoin the botanist at our hotel.|$|R
