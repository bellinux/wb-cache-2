5|$|A {{number of}} {{endocrine}} diseases involve dysfunctions of the adrenal gland. Overproduction of cortisol leads to Cushing's syndrome, whereas <b>insufficient</b> <b>production</b> {{is associated with}} Addison's disease. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a genetic disease produced by dysregulation of endocrine control mechanisms. A variety of tumors can arise from adrenal tissue and are commonly found in medical imaging when searching for other diseases.|$|E
5|$|By 17 August 1942, {{production}} {{had climbed}} rapidly after Blohm & Voss BV 138 production was scaled down and licence work had shut down at WFG. Production now reached some 150 Ju 87 D airframes per month, but spare parts were failing {{to reach the}} same production levels. Undercarriage parts were particularly in short supply. Milch ordered production to 350 Ju 87s per month in September 1942. This was not achievable due to the <b>insufficient</b> <b>production</b> capacity in the Reich.|$|E

25|$|Decreased {{platelet}} numbers {{may be due}} {{to various}} causes, including <b>insufficient</b> <b>production</b> (e.g., in myelodysplastic syndrome or other bone marrow disorders), destruction by the immune system (immune thrombocytopenic purpura/ITP), and consumption due to various causes (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/TTP, hemolytic-uremic syndrome/HUS, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria/PNH, disseminated intravascular coagulation/DIC, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia/HIT). Most consumptive conditions lead to platelet activation, and some are associated with thrombosis.|$|E
25|$|Deficiency in the enzymes of the {{porphyrin}} pathway {{leads to}} <b>insufficient</b> <b>production</b> of heme. Heme function plays {{a central role}} in cellular metabolism. This is not the main problem in the porphyrias; most heme synthesis enzymes—even dysfunctional enzymes—have enough residual activity to assist in heme biosynthesis. The principal problem in these deficiencies is the accumulation of porphyrins, the heme precursors, which are toxic to tissue in high concentrations. The chemical properties of these intermediates determine the location of accumulation, whether they induce photosensitivity, and whether the intermediate is excreted (in the urine or feces).|$|E
25|$|Anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) Anti-diuretic hormone regulates urine {{production}} by increasing water reabsorption in the kidney. Both <b>insufficient</b> <b>production</b> of ADH, or insufficient response to ADH, {{leads to an}} overproduction of urine, often beyond the capacity of a child's bladder. The body normally increases ADH levels at night, signalling the kidneys to produce less urine. The diurnal change may not be seen until about age 10. In some bed wetting children this increase in ADH production does not occur, while other children may produce an increased amount of ADH but their response is insufficient.|$|E
30|$|During neurocritical care, the {{cerebral}} interstitial levels of glutamate and glycerol {{are used as}} indicators of <b>insufficient</b> energy <b>production</b> and cellular degradation. However, if the microdialysis catheter is positioned in cerebral venous blood, these interpretations are not valid for reasons given above.|$|R
50|$|Growth hormone-{{releasing}} hormone (GHRH) {{is another}} releasing factor secreted by the hypothalamus. GHRH stimulates the pituitary gland to secrete growth hormone (GH), which has various effects on body growth and sexual development. <b>Insufficient</b> GH <b>production</b> may cause poor somatic growth, precocious puberty or gonadotropin deficiency, failure to initiate or complete puberty, {{and is often}} associated with rapid weight gain, low T4, and low levels of sex hormones.|$|R

Dresch never resumed production, however, a prototype Baltimore model was eventually shown at an exhibition in 1948 and the company continued producing spare parts into the 1950s. Unfortunately, pre-orders were <b>insufficient</b> and <b>production</b> was halted.|$|R
25|$|Addison's {{disease is}} (as of 20 August 2007) the illness most {{commonly}} {{reported to the}} Poodle Health Registry. The number of reported cases is nearly {{twice as high as}} the next most common problem (GDV). Addison's disease is characterized by <b>insufficient</b> <b>production</b> of glucocorticoid and/or mineralocortoid in the adrenal cortex (near the kidneys). Addison's is often undiagnosed because early symptoms are vague and easily mistaken for other conditions. Standard Poodles with unexplained lethargy, frequent gastric disturbances, or an inability to tolerate stress should be tested for it. Addison's can cause fatal sodium/potassium imbalances, but if caught early and treated with lifelong medication, most dogs can live a relatively normal life.|$|E

40|$|AbstractExocrine {{pancreatic}} insufficiency (EPI) is {{a common}} problem after surgery of the pancreas and stomach. It is usually caused by inadequate pancreatic enzyme activity resulting from <b>insufficient</b> enzyme <b>production,</b> <b>insufficient</b> enzyme activation or disturbed enzyme deactivation. A variety of direct and indirect pancreatic function tests such as the secretin–cerulein test, the faecal elastase test and the 13 C-mixed triglyceride breath test are used to assess exocrine pancreatic function. Few studies have addressed pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) following pancreatic surgery. These studies suggest beneficial effects of enzyme replacement after pancreatic resections. A {{number of studies have}} been performed to assess post-gastrectomy maldigestion and PERT. The treatment options remain controversial, although the published evidence is in favour of PERT leading to an overall improvement of symptoms. In conclusion, EPI following pancreatic surgery and total or partial gastrectomy remains a common clinical challenge. As a result of the lack of solid evidence, more clinical trials, particularly randomized, controlled clinical trials, are urgently needed...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. South African higher {{education}} is plagued by student articulation gap, which is often attributed to <b>insufficient</b> knowledge <b>production</b> processes and surface approaches to learning. Unfortunately, supervisor-student model of supervision, one of the direct, personal interventions to address this challenge, is plagued by multiple flaws. The traditional supervisor-student model of knowledge generation may not be adequate in externalizing research processes to students. Yet, a social learning model potentially extends the traditional model by providing a social environment where students collectively generate knowledge through peer-based interactions. Mindful of supervision dilemmas namely, this study explores technology-enhanced social learning environments as complements to traditional supervision models...|$|R
