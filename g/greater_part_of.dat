Meanwhile, the Roman emperor Caracalla (r.211–217AD) deposed the kings of Osroene and Armenia to make them Roman provinces once more. He marched into Mesopotamia under the pretext of marrying one of Artabanus' daughters, but—because the {{marriage}} was not allowed—made war on Parthia and conquered Arbil east of the Tigris river.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1096 and 1536, Norwich Cathedral has a Norman form, {{retaining}} the <b>greater</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> its original stone structure, {{which was then}} vaulted between 1416 and 1472 in a spectacular manner with hundreds of ornately carved, painted, and gilded bosses. It also has the finest Norman tower in England, surmounted by a 15th-century spire, and a large cloister with many more bosses.|$|E
5|$|Continued ingress {{of water}} from the roof and from unroofed {{exterior}} walkways above the ceiling level had caused seepage which carried down salts from the building mortar and deposited them on the ceiling through evaporation. In places this caused the surface of the frescoes to bubble and lift. Although discolouration was a serious problem, bubbling was not, because the thinness and transparency of the paint which Michelangelo employed on the <b>greater</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the ceiling permitted the salts to pass through rather than accumulating beneath the surface.|$|E

5|$|Fearing {{that the}} Greeks might attack the bridges across the Hellespont and trap his army in Europe, Xerxes {{resolved}} to do this, taking the <b>greater</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the army with him. Mardonius handpicked the troops {{who were to}} remain with him in Greece, taking the elite infantry units and cavalry, to complete the conquest of Greece. All of the Persian forces abandoned Attica, however, with Mardonius over-wintering in Boeotia and Thessaly; the Athenians were thus {{able to return to}} their burnt city for the winter.|$|E
5|$|Severus Alexander {{held him}} in high esteem {{and made him}} his consul again. His Roman History spans nearly a millennium, from the arrival of Aeneas in Italy until the year 229. As a {{contemporary}} of Elagabalus, Cassius Dio's account of his reign is generally considered more reliable than the Augustan History, although {{by his own admission}} Dio spent the <b>greater</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the relevant period outside of Rome and had to rely on second-hand information.|$|E
5|$|Sources often {{considered}} more credible than the Augustan History include the contemporary historians Cassius Dio and Herodian. Cassius Dio lived {{from the second}} half of the 2nd century until sometime after 229. Born into a patrician family, he spent the <b>greater</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> his life in public service. He was a senator under emperor Commodus and governor of Smyrna after the death of Septimius Severus. Afterwards he served as suffect consul around 205, and as proconsul in Africa and Pannonia.|$|E

5|$|Domitian's {{tendency}} towards micromanagement {{was nowhere}} {{more evident than}} in his financial policy. The question of whether Domitian left the Roman Empire in debt or with a surplus {{at the time of his}} death has been fiercely debated. The evidence points to a balanced economy for the <b>greater</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Domitian's reign. Upon his accession he revalued the Roman currency dramatically. He increased the silver purity of the denarius from 90% to 98% — the actual silver weight increasing from 2.87grams to 3.26grams. A financial crisis in 85 forced a devaluation of the silver purity and weight to 93.5% and 3.04grams respectively.|$|E
5|$|Even with Lancaster defeated, {{the battle}} against the rebels was not over. Edmund was charged with {{overtaking}} Wallingford Castle from Maurice de Berkeley in January 1323, a task which he fulfilled with great success. For his loyalty, Edmund was rewarded with substantial holdings in Wales, primarily land forfeited by Roger Mortimer. The <b>greater</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the spoils of war, however, went to the Despensers, who both benefited greatly from the forfeiture of the rebels. By 1326, the Despensers, father and son respectively, enjoyed incomes of £3,800 and £7,000, while Edmund's annual income was at only 2,355 marks (£1,570).|$|E
5|$|In 1935, the United States Department of the Interior {{created the}} Southwestern Range and Sheep Breeding Laboratory {{to address the}} {{problems}} Rambouillet stock had caused for the Navajo economy. Located at Fort Wingate, New Mexico, the program's aim was to develop a new sheep bloodline that simulated the wool characteristics of the 19th-century Navajo-Churro stock and would also supply adequate meat. The Fort Wingate researchers collected old Navajo-Churro stock from remote parts of the reservation and hired a weaver to test their experimental wool. Offspring of these experiments were distributed among the Navajo people. World War II interrupted the <b>greater</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> this effort when military work resumed at Fort Wingate.|$|E

5|$|In recent years, {{the city}} has {{experienced}} steady population growth, and has been faced {{with the issue of}} accommodating more residents. In 2006, after growing by 4,000citizens per year for the previous 16 years, regional planners expected the population of Seattle to grow by 200,000people by2040. However, former mayor Greg Nickels supported plans that would increase the population by 60%, or 350,000people, by 2040 and worked on ways to accommodate this growth while keeping Seattle's single-family housing zoning laws. The Seattle City Council later voted to relax height limits on buildings in the <b>greater</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Downtown, partly with the aim to increase residential density in the city center. As a sign of increasing inner-city growth, the downtown population crested to over 60,000 in 2009, up 77% since 1990.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{provide the}} <b>greater</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> food for humans, {{and for their}} {{domestic}} animals. They have {{played a key role}} in the history of world civilizations. Agriculture includes agronomy for arable crops, horticulture for vegetables and fruit, and forestry for timber. About 7,000 species of plant have been used for food, though most of today's food is derived from only 30 species. The major staples include cereals such as rice and wheat, starchy roots and tubers such as cassava and potato, and legumes such as peas and beans. Vegetable oils such as olive oil provide lipids, while fruit and vegetables contribute vitamins and minerals to the diet.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} a {{historical}} record that spans the <b>greater</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the Classic period and has been reconstructed in detail by archaeologists and epigraphers.

This unexpected defeat resulted in a 17-year hiatus at the city, during which time Copán may have been subject to Quiriguá in a reversal of fortunes.|$|E
