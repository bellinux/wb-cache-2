30|$|With {{regard to}} the {{physical}} properties of developed denim fabrics, the apparent specific gravity of the Hanji denim fabrics produced was {{lower than that of}} the existing denim fabrics, so garments when worn could feel light. The dimensional change in washing and drying: the rope-dyed yarn denim fabrics showed better dimensional stability than the fabrics with cheese-dyed yarns. The colorfastness to washing showed a higher chance of commercialization in all manufactured and existing commercial denim fabrics. The colorfastness to light, the developed denim fabrics using synthetic dyestuff as the warp yarn seemed to have no problem in merchandising while the stability against daylight of natural dyestuff was slightly lower. The <b>elongation</b> <b>recovery</b> rate of Hanji denim fabrics showed that most developed Hanji denim fabrics had a similar <b>elongation</b> <b>recovery</b> rate to the existing denim fabrics that had medium stretchability (S 1). The drying velocity of Hanji denim fabrics showed a tendency to increase with increasing fabric weight while the absorption velocity of Hanji denim fabrics showed significant differences: Hanji denim fabric was much faster to dry than those of existing denim fabrics.|$|E

40|$|In {{the medical}} and health care {{environment}} ‘intelligent ’ clothing must endure all the same treatments and procedures as standard hospital textile; that is laundry, disinfection and sterilization. The decontamination level depends on the end-use of the product. The smart garment system for long term body monitoring must be like any other technical underwear; fit well, be comfortable, elastic, vapor permeable, and have easy-care properties capable of enduring multiple cycles of laundry washing. Thus the use of man-made fibers, instead of traditionally used natural fibers, in a body monitoring garment would be more reasonable. The research focuses on disinfected and sterilized textile electrodes which are applicable for long term body monitoring. As high elasticity, comfort and good vapor permeability are needed, the research concentrates on the electrical and mechanical properties of knitted sensors after sterilization, disinfection and water-repellent treatment. The most important mechanical features of elastic textile electrodes are <b>elongation</b> <b>recovery</b> and dimensional stability. Before sterilization the textile must be cleaned properly from body fluids like blood and sweat. Improving the easy-clean properties would consequently be desirable. B...|$|E

For these purposes, manufactured rubber fiber was made as either an extruded round fiber or rectangular fibers cut into strips from extruded film. Because of its low dye acceptance, feel and appearance, the rubber fiber was either covered by yarn of another fiber or directly woven with other yarns into the fabric. Rubber yarns were used in foundation garments.|$|R

This analysis indicates that the stress-induced phase transition is a martensitic transformation.

The interactive effects of irrigation and seed burial depth on seedling emergence were also investigated. Seeds could germinate to high percentage in light and dark at 5 - 40 °C. Germination percentage increased slightly at low salinity (≤ 0. 2 mol l- 1 NaCl), then decreased with an increase in salinity from 0. 4 to 0. 8 mol l- 1; no seeds germinated at salinities ≥ 1. 0 mol l- 1.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Thermoplastic elastomers {{have been found to}} have unsual properties, a consequence of composition and structure. The molecular composition comprises hard thermoplastic blocks which aggregate into domains, and flexible elastomer blocks in a linear or inter-penetrating structure. The mechanical properties such as stress relaxation, tensile strength, <b>elongation,</b> <b>recovery</b> and hardness of some thermopastic elatomers have been studied in some detail. The stress relaxation studies have been made possible with the development of the stress relaxation measuring equipment at the Institute of Polymer Technology. Highly accurate and reproducible results were obtained from the "ideal curve" measurements taken with the equipment, which permits continuous measurements of residual force and instantaneous modulus. It was noted that stress relaxation, while not only dependent on thermoplastic type and/or formulation (as expected) but also depended on the measuring technique (e. g. the strain rate, continuous loading, interrupted loading etc.) which have significant effects on subsequent stress relaxation. Temperature and environment also affect the results. The effect of thermal treatment, lubrication of surfaces and interrupted loading were investigated. An attempt was made to relate the modulus enhancement factor "MEF" to Hysteresis. An attempt was also made to relate the change in "MEF" to the continuous structural re-organization in the material and finally to stress relaxation. The commercial significance of stress relaxation and "MEF" in the performance of seals and gaskets is also explored. Some of the material supplied by industry for this project was prepared by "dynamic vulcanization". Attempt has been made using peroxide cross-linking agent to prepare EPDM/PP blends by this technique to explore structure-property relationship. As expected, the cured samples out-performed the uncured samples.

This study presents an scientific database from evaluating physical properties of 1 × 1 rib stitch using A/W. In this study, 1 × 1 rib stitch using A/W were made at various knitting tensions (dial no. 2 - 6) and the number (4 - 6) of ply yarn. The physical properties of 1 × 1 rib stitch using A/W were measured and ana-lyzed. The density was in the range 5. 5 - 6. 4 wales/cm and 4. 0 - 5. 6 courses/cm, respectively. The density increased when less plying yarns and more knitting tension were added during knitting. The thickness was {{in the range of}} 1. 592 - 2. 362 mm and the tensile strength was in the range 32. 75 - 53. 63 Kgf/mm. The burst strength was in the range 107. 8 - 139. 2 N/cm 2.

Very often these spacer fabrics are molded into a desirable shape in order to fit with consumers' body contour. Thermal-mechanical properties of the spacer fabric are greatly affecting the molding properties and shape conformity of the molded spacer product. In this study, five different spacer fabrics were molded to a desirable bra cup shape with 6 cm cup depth (equivalent to a size 38 B's bra). The optimal molding conditions including molding temperature and molding time for each spacer fabric were found. It was shown that not all spacer fabrics can be molded to a desired cup shape.

40|$|Structural fire {{engineering}} {{has long}} {{relied on a}} prescriptive approach based on isolated member behavior under continuously heating standard fire. By definition, this approach does not allow comprehending the effects of interaction between members of a complete structure nor the effects of real fire exposure. Yet, such effects can have a significant influence on the response of real buildings to fire. Notably, when a structure has survived a fully developed fire, the cooling phase that inevitably follows generates effects that may endanger the structure stability. This has been attested by real structural collapses and poses a specific threat to firefighters. However, the behavior of structures under natural fire and the causes of failure during cooling are still not well understood. This research investigates the response of steel-framed structures to natural fires with the aim to analyze the possible collapse mechanisms during cooling. Numerical simulations by nonlinear finite element method are conducted for different fire scenarios and structural designs. The simulations model the thermo-mechanical behavior of the frames accounting for the interaction between members during the entire fire duration until burnout. Different collapse mechanisms during cooling are highlighted and discussed, including connection failure and progressive collapse under localized fire. In the latter case, collapse of members not directly affected by the fire occurs during the cooling phase. These mechanisms result from a complex combination of several factors, such as the <b>recovery</b> of thermal <b>elongation,</b> the <b>recovery</b> of stiffness, and the prior development of permanent strains in the heated members. The results show that steel-framed structures are subject to collapse during the cooling phase of natural fires. Therefore, natural fires with heating-cooling sequences represent a loading case {{that should be considered}} in structural fire analyses and could lead to specific design provisions to prevent the occurrence of collapse during cooling.

Improved methods have been developed for the production of thread and for measuring its mechanical properties. The best specimens of thread produced from cultures of strain FJ 7 grown in TB medium at 20 degrees C varied in diameter by a factor of 1. 09 over a 30 -mm thread length. The stress-strain behavior of cell walls was determined over the range of relative humidities between 11 and 98 %. Measurements of over 125 specimens indicated that cell wall behaved like other viscoelastic polymers, both natural and man-made, exhibiting relaxation under constant <b>elongation</b> and <b>recovery</b> upon load removal. This kinetic behavior and also the cell wall strength depended greatly on humidity. The recovery from extension observed after loading even up to a substantial fraction of the breaking load indicated that the properties measured were those of cell wall material rather than of behavior of the thread assemblage. Control experiments showed that neither drying of thread nor the length of time it remained dry before testing influenced the mechanical properties of the cell walls. Specimens drawn from TB medium and then washed in water and redrawn were found to be stiffer and stronger than controls not washed. However, tensile properties were not changed by exposure of cells to lysozyme before thread production. This suggests that glycan backbones are not arranged {{along the length of the}} cell cylinder. The strength of the cell wall in vivo was estimated by extrapolation to 100 % relative humidity to be about 3 N/mm 2. Walls of this strength would be able to bear a turgor pressure of 6 atm (ca. 607. 8 kPa), but if the increase in strength of water-washed threads was appropriate, the figure could be 24 atm (ca. 2, 431. 2 kPa) ...|$|R

The microstructure evolution during both deformation by ECAP and subsequent annealing was investigated and correlated with the mechanical properties. The successive grain refinement during ECAP was promoted by two parallel mechanisms, namely dislocation driven grain fragmentation and twin fragmentation, and accounted for the ultra-high strength. In addition, due to the relatively low volume fraction of deformation twins after ECAP at 300 °C, further contribution of deformation twinning during room temperature deformation allowed additional work-hardening capacity and <b>elongation.</b> During subsequent <b>recovery</b> annealing the ultra-fine grains and deformation twins were thermally stable, which supported retainment of the high yield strength along with regained uniform elongation.

In the work presented here, I will show that complementary molecular and imaging techniques, in combination with utilization of the Drosophila Hsp 70 gene, provides an attractive and suitable model for identification of bona fide transcription elongation factors in vivo. Through ChIP assays of the first wave of Pol II after heat shock in S 2 cells I show that KD of Spt 6 reduces the rate of Pol II <b>elongation.</b> Also, fluorescence <b>recovery</b> after photobleaching assays of GFP-Pol II in salivary gland cells show that this Spt 6 -dependent effect on elongation rate persists during steady-state-induced transcription, reducing the elongation rate from approximately 1100 to 500 bp/min. This drop in the rate of transcription elongation results in accumulation of less Hsp 70 mRNA after heat shock induction. I also demonstrate that Spt 6 plays a critical role in recruitment of the Paf 1 complex and Spt 5 to the heat shock loci. RNAi knock-down of Spt 6 also decreases the global levels of Ser 2 -P CTD. Furthermore, RNAi depletion of Spt 6 reveals its broad requirement during different stages of development. In summary, this work shows that in combination with complementary molecular and imaging techniques, the Drosophila Hsp 70 gene provides an attractive model system for analyzing the role of suspected transcription factors in transcription elongation. In a separate project, I also report that a previously uncharacterized SET domain-containing Drosophila nuclear protein, CG 40351 (dSet 1), and not the other putative histone H 3 K 4 methyltransferases, is predominantly responsible for trimethylation of bulk histone H 3 K 4 and histones at the 5 '-end of tested transcriptionally-active genes. Polytene staining and live cell imaging results also show widespread association of dSet 1 with transcriptionally-active loci, including activated Hsp 70 gene.

Effect of plant age, seed weight, and nutrient concentration on root weight, length, {{and number of}} apices. New Zealand Journal of Botany, 8 (3), 344 - 356 The effects of defoliation, shading and dark on the growth and morphology of roots of Lolium perenne L. plants have been examined using glass fronted containers and a technique developed for measuring root lengths and numbers of apices. A single defoliation caused a rapid drop in root elongation followed by a more gradual recovery with the most severe defoliation treatment having the greatest effect. Repeated defoliation caused a prolonged depression of root <b>elongation</b> but some <b>recovery</b> occurred. The most severe treatment resulted in considerable root death. With shading, root elongation fell over the first 8 - 10 days and then recovered to near the control level. Both defoliation and shading caused {{an increase in the}} length per unit weight of the root systems. Root elongation of plants placed in the dark fell rapidly to near zero, the effect being comparable with that of defoliating plants to 2. 5 cm or less. Defoliation of plants placed in the dark caused a more rapid fall in elongation. Supplying glucose or sucrose to the roots of plants defoliated to the extent that root elongation would otherwise have ceased maintained elongation at up to two-thirds of the level of undefoliated plants. Sucrose was marginally more effective than glucose with little difference between concentrations 1 - 6 %. Benzyladenine and indole-acetic-acid marginally increased elongation in the presence of sucrose. Dark-treated plants responded in a similar manner to defoliated plants to sucrose. The level of soluble carbohydrates in the roots of plants defoliated or placed in the dark was seen to be low after root elongation ceased and recovered as root elongation recovered. However the level at the time most roots ceased elongating was higher than in other experiments where root elongation was near optimum. That under these conditions the addition of sucrose or glucose maintains elongation at up to two-thirds of the control level suggests that translocation of soluble carbohydrates to the root apex may be the limiting factor. This possibility is supported by the difference in levels of soluble carbohydrates {{in various parts of the}} plant following defoliation at two different times of the day. The technique used to measure soluble carbohydrates was not sensitive enough to permit analysis of the root tips and thus check the hypothesis. Apart from the requirement for soluble carbohydrates and the apparent associated translocation factor there is evidently some other factor (s) limiting root elongation of defoliated and dark-treated plants. The nature of this factor was not determined...|$|R
40|$|During the {{development}} of the nervous system, neurons extend their axons over a long distance to their targets with the assistance of guidance cues and guidance receptors. Although we have detailed knowledge about the variety of these guidance molecules, little is known about how the distributions of the guidance molecules are controlled in space and time. Immunohistochemical studies have revealed that the spatial distribution of axon guidance receptors is often regulated at sub-cellular levels, or rather at sub-axonal levels. For example, in the Drosophila ventral nerve cords, a repulsive guidance receptor Roundabout and its family members (Robo 2 and Robo 3) are specifically expressed in the longitudinal axon tracts, which indicates that Robo receptors are localized to the distal segment of the axons but excluded from the proximal segment of the same axons. This restricted expression of Robo within axons is largely conserved from fruit flies to mammals. Moreover, recent findings that receptors can influence the distribution of guidance cues underscore the importance of the regulated expression of guidance receptors. 　A fundamental question about such sub-axonal localization of molecules is whether the localization is dependent on extrinsic signals such as cell-cell contacts, or is due to intrinsic properties of neurons. Although it has long been known that neurons possess an intrinsic ability to acquire axonal and somatodendritic domains, the possibility that neurons have an intrinsic ability to generate sub-axonal domains remains to be explored. Another question is how the localization of transmembrane molecules in certain region of the axonal membrane is established and maintained. Molecules should first be asymmetrically delivered to the axonal membrane, and then the asymmetric distribution of the molecules should be retained {{despite the fact that the}} axonal membrane is continuous and fluid. 　To distinguish between the contributions of extrinsic factors and intrinsic properties on {{the development}} of the sub-axonal localization of molecules, I used a low-density primary culture system of Drosophila neurons where neurons extend their axons without cell-cell contacts. I reasoned that if neurons have an intrinsic property to create sub-axonal localization of molecules, localization of Robo receptors could be seen in the cultured neurons. When cultured neurons were immunostained for Robo proteins, cultured neurons exhibited uniform distribution of Robo along their axons, suggesting that Robo may require extrinsic cues for its localization. In contrast, Robo 2 and Robo 3 were localized to the distal segment of the axons even in cultured neurons. This result indicates that neurons possess an intrinsic property to generate the localization of Robo 2 and Robo 3. 　I next asked how the localization of Robo 3 in the distal axon segment is established during the course of axonal elongation. One possibility is that molecules are delivered only to the growing tip of the axon, and the localization pattern along the axon is determined by the temporal pattern of the ON and OFF of the delivery. To examine the course of localization, I performed time-lapse recordings of growing neurons that express Robo 3 -EGFP fusion proteins. When axons just started to extend, Robo 3 -EGFP was detected only in cell bodies. At around 8 hrs from the onset of axonal elongation, strong GFP signals appeared at the distal segment of the axons. Localization of Robo 3 -EGFP at the distal axon segment occurred after axonal elongation but not together with axonal elongation. In addition, when the fluorescent signal of Robo 3 -EGFP in the distal axon segment was eliminated by intense 488 nm laser illumination, Robo 3 -EGFP signal reappeared to the distal axon segment without further axonal <b>elongation</b> (13 % <b>recovery</b> in 40 minutes). Thus, it is likely that the localization of molecules and axonal elongation are uncoupled processes. 　Next, I examined how the localization of transmembrane molecules such as Robo receptors in the axonal membrane is maintained. One possibility is that molecules are immobilized along the axon by being anchored to the membrane cytoskeleton and therefore the localization patterns can be retained. To test this possibility, I assessed the dynamics of molecules that are localized to the distal segment of the axon using a fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) method. In FRAP experiments, a discrete region of the cell is photobleached, and then the recovery of fluorescence over time is measured, which gives information about the mobility of molecules. When FRAP analysis of Robo 3 -EGFP was performed in the distal axon segment, fluorescent signals recovered to the photobleached area in an exponential manner, suggesting that Robo 3 -EGFP is diffusible along the axon. Thus, anchoring model seems to be insufficient to explain the persisted localization of Robo 3 in the axon. 　Given that Robo 3 -EGFP is mobile in the axonal membrane, how is Robo 3 -EGFP kept from uniformly distributing along the axon? One possibility is that there exists a diffusion barrier between the distal and proximal segments of the axon, and that the barrier prevents Robo 3 -EGFP from entering into the proximal segment. I reasoned that if there exists a diffusion barrier at the boundary between the distal and proximal segments (Robo 3 -EGFP localization defines the distal segment), then the mobility of Robo-EGFP across the boundary could also be restricted by the diffusion barrier. In this case, FRAP experiments should result in that fluorescent signals recovering more slowly from the side close to the boundary compared to the side away from the boundary. Conversely, if there is no diffusion barrier at the boundary, fluorescent signals should recover equally from both ends of the photobleached area. When the proximal part of the axon from the boundary was photobleached, less Robo-EGFP signal recovered from the side close to the boundary compared to the side close to the cell body. Thus, it is likely that the mobility of molecules across the boundary of segments is restricted by a diffusion barrier mechanism. 　Finally, I tested whether this diffusion barrier acts specifically to Robo family of receptors or acts generally to transmembrane proteins. The mobility of CD 8 -GFP, a transmembrane molecule that has no similarity to Robo receptors, was tested by FRAP experiments. The mobility of CD 8 -GFP across the boundary was also restricted. This result suggests that the boundary between the proximal and distal compartments acts as a general diffusion barrier to transmembrane proteins. 　Using a primary cell culture system of Drosophila, here I have demonstrated that neurons have an intrinsic property to create the sub-axonal localization of Robo 2 and Robo 3. FRAP experiments revealed that the mobility of transmembrane proteins was restricted at the boundary between the segments. I propose that neurons possess an intrinsic property to compartmentalize their axons by a diffusion barrier mechanism, and that the compartment boundary regulates the localization of Robo 2 and Robo 3. The result that Robo was uniformly distributed along the axons in cultured neurons suggests that neurons might use extrinsic factor(s) to generate the localization of Robo. It would be also interesting to examine whether the localization of Robo 2 and Robo 3 could be further adjusted by extrinsic factors. Robo receptors would provide insights into how intrinsic properties of neurons and extrinsic factors participate in regulating the distribution of guidance receptors...|$|R
