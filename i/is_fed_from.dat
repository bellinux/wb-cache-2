25|$|The P7 <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> <b>from</b> a single-stack box {{magazine}} with {{a capacity of}} 8 rounds, which is held inside the firearm's frame with a release located at the heel of the grip. After the last round has been fired, the slide will remain open thanks to a slide catch that can be released by pulling the slide further back or pressing the squeeze cocker.|$|E
25|$|The {{precision}} rifle is a semi-automatic-only rifle with {{a similar}} operating system to other Galil variants, but optimised for accuracy. The rifle <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> <b>from</b> a 25-round box magazine. It uses a heavy-profile match barrel that is heavier than that used on other variants. It is fitted with a multi-functional muzzle device, which acts as both a flash suppressor and a muzzle brake. It can be replaced with a sound suppressor, which {{requires the use of}} subsonic ammunition for maximum effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|The {{input signal}} is coupled through {{capacitor}} C1 {{to the base}} of transistor Q1. The capacitor allows the AC signal to pass, but blocks the DC bias voltage established by resistors R1 and R2 so that any preceding circuit is not affected by it. Q1 and Q2 form a differential amplifier (an amplifier that multiplies the difference between two inputs by some constant), in an arrangement known as a long-tailed pair. This arrangement is used to conveniently allow the use of negative feedback, which <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> <b>from</b> the output to Q2 via R7 and R8.|$|E

25|$|The Galil <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> <b>from</b> a curved, steel box {{magazine}} with a 35-round capacity (SAR and AR versions), a 50-round capacity (ARM model) or a special color-coded 12-round magazine blocked for use exclusively with ballistite (blank) cartridges, used to launch rifle grenades. The magazine is inserted front end {{first in a}} similar manner to the AK family. An optional magazine adaptor enables the use of M16 type STANAG magazines. Some who have used the Galil ARM with the 50-round magazine have noted {{that it is difficult to}} engage targets at elevated heights while firing on the ground in the prone position due to the magazine's extended length.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} fixed armament for the AH-1G, AH-1P (formerly {{referred to}} as AH-1S Production), AH-1Q, and initial AH-1S models, this turret unit {{is similar to the}} XM64 mentioned later in this section, but was capable of mounting two M134 Miniguns, two M129 40mm grenade launchers, or one of each weapon. Miniguns fitted are capable of pre-set firing rates of either 2,000 or 4,000 RPM, while the turret itself has 114 degrees of motion left or right, 17.5 degrees of elevation and 50 degrees of depression (alternate sources describe 110 degrees in azimuth, 20 degrees of elevation and 50 degrees of depression for the M28E1 model specifically). Each Minigun is linked to 4,000 rounds of ammunition while each grenade launcher <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> <b>from</b> a 300-round magazine.|$|E
500|$|An inverted-F antenna {{is a type}} of antenna used in {{wireless}} communication. [...] It {{consists of}} a monopole antenna running parallel to a ground plane and grounded at one end. [...] The antenna <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> <b>from</b> an intermediate point a distance from the grounded end. [...] The design has two advantages over a simple monopole: the antenna is shorter and more compact, and the impedance matching can be controlled by the designer without the need for extraneous matching components.|$|E

500|$|LIFE was {{essentially}} {{a combination of the}} Mercury concepts and new physical arrangements to greatly reduce the volume of the NIF while making it much easier to build and maintain. Whereas an NIF beamline for one of its 192 lasers is over [...] long, LIFE was based on a design about [...] long that contained everything from the power supplies to frequency conversion optics. Each module was completely independent, unlike NIF which <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> <b>from</b> a central signal from the Master Oscillator, allowing the units to be individually removed and replaced while the system as a whole continued operation.|$|E
500|$|Tripp's {{second edition}} in 1987 {{discussed}} the first edition's reception. [...] He wrote that no sentence in it stirred such a [...] "hateful reaction" [...] as Tripp's comment that, [...] "When {{two men are}} excited and unrestrained in their sexual interaction, the fire that <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> <b>from</b> both sides often does whip up levels of eroticism that are very rarely reached elsewhere." [...] Tripp accused his critic Hendin of using that sentence to wrongly portray him as maintaining that homosexuality is an inherently superior form of sexual expression. The sociologist Jonathan Dollimore described Tripp's account of psychoanalytic theories of homosexuality as an over-simplification bordering on parody.|$|E
500|$|Once M-20 reaches Midland on Jerome Street, {{it crosses}} the Tittabawassee River {{north of the}} Tridge, a three-legged bridge over the {{confluence}} of the Tittabawassee and Chippewa rivers. There it joins Business US10 (Bus. US10) on a pair of one-way streets: Indian Street (westbound) and Buttles Street (eastbound). The two streets pass by Dow Diamond, home to the Great Lakes Loons, the city's minor league baseball team. Bus. US10/M-20 then passes some Dow Chemical Company buildings and curves into a freeway stub connecting with the US10 freeway {{on the east side of}} town. This short section of business loop freeway has two interchanges before terminating at one final interchange. [...] At this junction, both Bus. US10 and M-20 have a common eastern terminus. [...] Traffic headed eastbound on the business loop defaults onto eastbound US10, and traffic destined for the business loop <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> <b>from</b> the westbound direction of the freeway only.|$|E

50|$|The Sturmgewehr 52 (STG-52) was {{a battle}} rifle {{manufactured}} by the government-owned W+F Bern of Switzerland. It was chambered in the 7.5mm Kurzpatrone cartridge {{and later the}} 7.5mm Swiss service round as the Sturmgewehr 54, which <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> <b>from</b> the right-hand side. The Sturmgewehr 52 was heavily patterned after the German FG 42 as it <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> <b>from</b> the side from a 30- or 40-round magazine and was also fitted with a muzzle attachment capable of launching rifle grenades.|$|R
500|$|Early puberty {{and early}} {{masturbation}} are seen by Tripp as {{important factors in}} the development of male homosexuality, albeit not direct causes. He maintains that homosexual men tend to start masturbating earlier than heterosexual men, continue to masturbate more extensively {{for the rest of their}} lives, and also tend to have a larger than average penis size. Tripp sees early sexual experiences with persons of the same sex as having only a limited role {{in the development of}} male homosexuality. While he observes that homosexual men vary in their sexual attitudes, Tripp writes that, [...] "when two men are excited and unrestrained in their sexual interaction, the fire that <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> <b>from</b> both sides often does whip up levels of eroticism that are rarely reached elsewhere." [...] Tripp considers promiscuity [...] "relatively prevalent" [...] among homosexual men as a group, though he noted that not all homosexual men are promiscuous. Tripp maintains that heterosexual men would be as promiscuous as homosexual men if they had the same level of opportunity. He criticizes psychotherapeutic attempts to convert homosexuals to heterosexuality, writing that Kinsey and his associates found no evidence of their effectiveness. Tripp writes that a [...] "New York psychiatrist who for a number of years has headed a large psychoanalytic research program on homosexuality" [...] admitted to Pomeroy that he knew of only one patient he had helped to become heterosexual but was on such poor terms with him that he did not feel free to contact him so that he could verify his claim to have changed his sexual orientation.|$|E

2500|$|The Ten Ar River <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> <b>from</b> most of {{the valley}} by the Kumbar stream, the Manalaar River ("sand river"), the Kalyanivalasu Odai and other smaller tributaries from the higher forests and sholas to the east. At the {{northwest}} end of the valley, the Ten Ar is joined by the Varavandi Odai stream flowing from a smaller adjacent valley {{to the east and}} soon joins the Amaravati River [...] down stream to the west. The Amaravati River then flows north to the Amaravathi Reservoir and Dam and then to the Cauvery River.|$|E
2500|$|The Pucará was {{designed}} for operations from short, rough airstrips. The retractable tricycle landing gear, with a single nosewheel and twin mainwheels retracting into the engine nacelles, is fitted with low pressure tyres to suit operations on rough ground, while the undercarriage legs are tall to give good clearance for underslung weapons loads. Three JATO rockets can be fitted under the fuselage to allow extra short takeoffs. Fuel <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> <b>from</b> two fuselage tanks of combined capacity of [...] and two self-sealing tanks of [...] in the wings. The undercarriage, flaps and brakes are operated hydraulically, with no pneumatic systems.|$|E

2500|$|Most of the {{population}} occupies roughly one-quarter of the city's land. Pittsfield lies at {{the confluence of the}} east and west branches of the Housatonic River, which flows south from the city towards its mouth at Long Island Sound, some [...] distant. The eastern branch leads down from the hills, while the western branch <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> <b>from</b> Onota Lake and Pontoosuc Lake (which lies partly in Lanesborough). Like much of western Berkshire County, the city lies between the Berkshire Hills to the east and the Taconic Range to the west. Sections of the Housatonic Valley Wildlife Management Area dot the banks of the river.|$|E
2500|$|The MAR, or the Micro Galil, is a reduced-size {{version of}} the Galil SAR (706mm stock {{extended}} / 465mm folded), weighing 2.98kg (6.57 pounds) empty. Compared to the original carbine, the MAR has a shortened barrel (210mm), receiver, piston, gas tube and foregrip. The firearm <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> <b>from</b> a 35-round steel magazine which can be clipped together to increase reload speed. The MAR has the same rate of fire (630-750 rounds/min) as other 5.56mm Galil models. An optional magazine adapter inserted inside the magazine well allows the use of standard 20- and 30-round M16 magazines. The lever safety and fire selector (located {{on both sides of}} the receiver) has four settings: [...] "S"—weapon is safe, [...] "A"—automatic fire, [...] "B"—3-round burst, [...] "R"—semi-automatic mode. The barrel has a multifunction muzzle device. The MAR is equipped with a folding tubular aluminum stock and a flip aperture sight with two settings: 0–300m and beyond 300 m. The MAR can also be equipped with a night vision device (attached through an adapter mounted to the left side of the receiver), a daytime optical sight (mounted via a receiver cover adapter), low-light sights with tritium illuminated dots, a vertical forward grip with integrated laser pointer, silencer and a nylon sling. Upon request, the weapon can be supplied with a bolt catch, plastic magazines weighing 0.164kg or an enlarged trigger guard for use with gloves.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rotary engine}} places severe thermal {{stresses}} on its cases, as {{two sides of}} rotor are constantly exposed to high ignition and exhaust temperatures, while the third side inducts cool fuel/air mixture. To cope with this, and probably capitalizing on their previous experience with water cooling, Suzuki opted for a liquid-cooled engine using two separate systems. Oil is used to lubricate and cool the internals of the rotor and water-cooled the external jacketing. Oil <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> <b>from</b> an engine sump by a trochoid pump at around [...] The oil is then circulated through an oil cooler mounted across the frame and below the radiator. A pressure regulator also acts as a bypass {{in case of a}} blockage in the cooler. A centrifugal pump sends coolant around the external rotor jacketing but via an intricate path in an attempt to even out the massive thermal stresses. Liquid enters at the point of highest temperatures (ignition), passing from the right side to the left, and then makes a 180° turn, returning to the right side and passing near the exhaust port. Most of the coolant is then routed to the very large radiator that sits across the frame in front of the bike. Some of the coolant that was not directed to the radiator is now sent around the inlet port and the left side housing. Its passage is once again reversed before flowing to the radiator. [...] The water cooling is thermostatically controlled, and a shrouded fan {{on the right side of}} the radiator takes care of excessive temperatures, switching on at [...] and cutting when the temperature falls below [...]|$|E
