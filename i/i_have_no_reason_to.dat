500|$|With reports speculating that Costa {{wanting to}} leave Chelsea, Costa affirmed on 2 June 2015 after Chelsea's post-season tour {{that he had}} no desire to leave London, saying, [...] "It's always a bit more {{difficult}} in the first season for adaptation, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> leave this place, I love it, the fans love me, and I want to stay. It’s really good to come in the first season [...] and win two things [...] Next year I’ll be ready to come back and, hopefully, win a couple more trophies." ...|$|E
500|$|MacMillan {{himself had}} been {{involved}} in the National Council for Canadian-Soviet Friendship in the 1940s, though he had since quit that organization. In 1950, with an eye to taking the orchestra on international tours, he had written a letter to the American consul in Toronto admitting his former affiliation. He received his visa in November 1951 without any difficulties. After the six musicians were denied entry and before the orchestra had left for the United States, MacMillan solicited help for them from the Canadian ambassador in Washington, but his plea was unsuccessful. In January 1952 he wrote to US immigration officials trying to clear Staryk's name, lauding him as [...] "an exceptionally talented violinist and valuable member of the orchestra. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> doubt that he has no Communist affiliations other than that he played from ages twelve to fourteen with a Ukrainian orchestra that is under some suspicion". [...] His entreaties on behalf of Staryk did not help to exonerate the musician.|$|E
500|$|In April 2010, Pascu sparked {{criticism}} in the media when he agreed to perform at a Timişoara rally of Gregorian Bivolaru's Yoga movement (MISA). Bivolaru's legal troubles and allegations regarding MISA's sexual policies were the center of public debates; when contacted by reporters, Pascu stressed {{that it was a}} regular gig and stated, [...] "Those people have never harmed me and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> be avoiding their company." [...] Pascu's activities for that year included other live concerts, including one held during the Bookfest event of June. In November, he was a guest at the Mircea Baniciu tribute concert, entertaining the public with musical impressions of folk singers Nicu Alifantis and Victor Socaciu, and performing Pasărea Colibri classics. Pascu also purchased his own drinking establishment and live music venue, a Bucharest tavern he named Gyuri's Pub, which hosted performances by the Moldovan folk singer Radu Captari. A collaborator of Pascu on solo music projects during spring 2010, Captari sang and played the guitar while riding a horse.|$|E

2500|$|Darwish {{is widely}} {{perceived}} as a Palestinian symbol and a spokesman for Arab opposition to Israel. He rejected accusations of antisemitism: [...] "The accusation is that I hate Jews. It's not comfortable that they show me as a devil and an enemy of Israel. I am not a lover of Israel, of course. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> be. But I don't hate Jews." [...] Darwish wrote in Arabic, and also spoke English, French, and Hebrew.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the face}} of laws restricting public {{assembly}} and freedom of the media, restricting campaigning by the MDC for the 2005 Zimbabwe parliamentary elections, President Mbeki was quoted as saying: <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> think that anything will happen … that anybody in Zimbabwe will act {{in a way that}} will militate against the elections being free and fair.

Mr. Warren told Mr. Wayne about the {{transition}} of the show from radio to TV, and Mr. Wayne readily agreed that James Arness would be a terrific choice for the part of Matt Dillon. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> doubt the story, because Jimmy absolutely knew everybody." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the release}} of The Real Thing, Faith No More {{developed}} somewhat of a rivalry with fellow Californian funk rock group Red Hot Chili Peppers, whom they had previously played with on The Uplift Mofo Party Tour. Singer Anthony Kiedis accused Mike Patton of stealing his [...] "style" [...] in the [...] "Epic" [...] music video. He told Kerrang! magazine [...] "My drummer says he’s gonna kidnap , shave his hair off and cut off one of his feet, just so he’ll be forced to find a style of his own". In a separate interview, he clarified his comment, remarking [...] "I love The Real Thing, and I liked his vocals on that record. I mean, when I heard the record I noticed subtle similarities, but when I saw that video it was like, 'Wait a second here, what the fuck?.'" [...] Roddy Bottum responded by saying [...] "To me, our band sounds nothing like Red Hot Chili Peppers. If you're talking about long hair, rapping with his shirt off, then yeah, I can see similarities. But beyond that, I can't see any. I haven't talked to them since this whole thing started. We're really good friends with that band and i'd like to think they're doing it... like as a favour". Mike Patton finally addressed the allegations from Kiedis in 1990, commenting that [...] "It just kind of {{came out of the}} blue. It doesn't bother me a bit. I got a real big kick out of it to tell you the truth. I mean, if he's gonna talk about me in interviews, that's fine - it's free press! Either he's feeling inadequate or old or I don't know, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> talk shit about him." [...] Later in 2001, Patton also theorized that [...] "I think Anthony, deep down, feels like I'm a better dancer than he is. I think I shake my booty just a little bit fresher than he does. And if he would stop doing drugs I think he could outdance me. Maybe one day we'll have a breakoff, just breakdance." ...|$|E
