5|$|Many {{critics have}} {{challenged}} the second premise of this argument, {{by offering a}} biological and sociological account {{of the development of}} human morality which suggests that it is neither objective nor absolute. This account, supported by biologist E. O. Wilson and philosopher Michael Ruse, proposes that the human experience of morality is a by-product of natural selection, a theory philosopher Mark D. Linville calls evolutionary naturalism. According to the theory, the human experience of moral obligations was the result of evolutionary pressures, which attached a sense of morality to human psychology because it was useful for moral development; this entails that moral values do not exist independently of the human mind. Morality might be better understood as an evolutionary imperative in order to propagate genes and ultimately reproduce. No human society today advocates immorality, such as theft or murder, because it would undoubtedly lead to the end of that particular society and any chance for future survival of offspring. Scottish empiricist David Hume made a similar argument, that belief in objective moral truths is unwarranted and to <b>discuss</b> <b>them</b> is meaningless.|$|E

25|$|The cavalry {{division}} of Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) George Armstrong Custer seized a supply train and 25 guns, effectively blocking Lee's path because Appomattox Station {{is to the}} west of Appomattox Court House. This unique action pitted artillery without infantry support against cavalry. Custer captured and burned three trains loaded with provisions for Lee's army. Grant sent a letter to Lee offering generous surrender terms, as urged by President Abraham Lincoln, and proposing a meeting to <b>discuss</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{are areas}} {{of his life}} and daily routine that Keats does not describe. He {{mentions}} little about his childhood or his financial straits and is seemingly embarrassed to <b>discuss</b> <b>them.</b> There is a total absence of any reference to his parents. In his last year, as his health deteriorated, his concerns often gave way to despair and morbid obsessions. The publications of letters to Fanny Brawne in 1870 focused on this period and emphasised this tragic aspect, giving rise to widespread criticism at the time.|$|E

25|$|Nissim ben Jacob's Hakdamah Le'mafteach Hatalmud {{argued that}} it was {{unnecessary}} for Judah the Prince to <b>discuss</b> <b>them</b> as many of these laws were so well known. Margolies suggests that as the Mishnah was redacted after the Bar Kokhba revolt, Judah could not have included discussion of Hanukkah, which commemorates the Jewish revolt against the Seleucid Empire (the Romans would not have tolerated this overt nationalism). Similarly, there were then several decrees in place aimed at suppressing outward signs of national identity, including decrees against wearing tefillin and tzitzit; as conversion to Judaism was against Roman law, Judah would not have discussed this.|$|E
25|$|On February 5, 2008, the WGA {{leadership}} {{scheduled a}} meeting for active members on Saturday, February 9, 2008 {{to discuss and}} gain feedback on a proposed contract. TV executives had described the deadline as February 15 for new material to be produced for the 2007–08 television season. On February 9, 2008, WGA President Patric Verrone emailed the membership announcing that the WGA leadership and AMPTP had reached a tentative deal. The tentative contract proposals were provided to the membership, and a meeting to <b>discuss</b> <b>them</b> as well as future process was scheduled the same day on both coasts.|$|E
25|$|Other {{important}} criteria {{throughout history}} are that great powers should have enough influence {{to be included}} in discussions of political and diplomatic questions of the day, and have influence on the final outcome and resolution. Historically, when major political questions were addressed, several great powers met to <b>discuss</b> <b>them.</b> Before the era of groups like the United Nations, participants of such meetings were not officially named, but were decided based on their great power status. These were conferences which settled important questions based on major historical events. This might mean deciding the political resolution of various geographical and nationalist claims following a major conflict, or other contexts.|$|E

25|$|Singing is an {{integrated}} and coordinated act {{and it is}} difficult to discuss any of the individual technical areas and processes without relating them to the others. For example, phonation only comes into perspective when it is connected with respiration; the articulators affect resonance; the resonators affect the vocal folds; the vocal folds affect breath control; and so forth. Vocal problems are often a result of a breakdown in one part of this coordinated process which causes voice teachers to frequently focus in, intensively, on one area of the process with their student until that issue is resolved. However, some areas of the art of singing are so much the result of coordinated functions that it is hard to <b>discuss</b> <b>them</b> under a traditional heading like phonation, resonation, articulation, or respiration.|$|E
500|$|After leaving Trinity College he {{travelled}} to London, {{where he}} {{became a member of}} Clifford's Inn in 1571. This was to learn the basics of the law – the Inns of Chancery, including Clifford's Inn, provided initial legal education before transfer to the Inns of Court, where one could be called to the Bar and practise as a barrister. Students were educated through arguments and debates– they would be given precedents and writs each day, <b>discuss</b> <b>them</b> at the dinner table and then argue a moot court based on those precedents and their discussions. Coke also studied various writs [...] "till they turned honey sweet on his tongue", and after completing this stage of his legal education transferred to the Inner Temple on 24 April 1572.|$|E
500|$|The Jets were enraged by {{the outcome}} of the game, for reasons {{unrelated}} to the television problems, of which they were initially unaware. Feeling that Hudson's disqualification was unjustified (his replacement, D'Amato, was beaten for the winning touchdown), assistant coach Walt Michaels chased after the officials, and he and team doctor James Nicholas banged on the door of their dressing room, complaining bitterly. Ewbank mentioned the officiating in his postgame press conference. When told of Michaels' actions, the head coach ordered, [...] "Get him out of there, it can only cost him money." [...] Oakland coach Rauch told reporters, [...] "There were so many turning points which kept putting both teams back in the game, it's impossible to <b>discuss</b> <b>them</b> all." ...|$|E

500|$|He {{acknowledged}} {{that he had been}} driving MacMillan around the evening of July5, 1933, when he was followed by Caldwell and MacLean, but gave a dramatically different account of his reasons for doing so. [...] According to him, there had been talk of MacMillan joining his family at their rental cottage at Sylvan Lake that weekend provided that she could get the necessary time off work, and that evening he called her {{to see whether or not}} she had been able to. [...] During the ensuing phone conversation, MacMillan told him that she had other problems bothering her, and asked if Brownlee would take her for a drive to <b>discuss</b> <b>them.</b> [...] He agreed to do so, and it was during this drive that he noticed that he was being followed.|$|E
500|$|In her {{review for}} TrekNation, Michelle Erica Green praised the episode, {{saying it was}} an {{improvement}} on [...] "Borderland" [...] and that Spiner was even better. But she found {{the murder of the}} doctor shocking and felt that it had gone too far. She said that themes raised in [...] "Cold Station 12" [...] mirrored those which could have appeared on The Original Series but that this episode didn't take the time to <b>discuss</b> <b>them.</b> She hoped that the final episode of the trilogy would cover that ground. The mini-arc featuring the episodes [...] "Borderland", [...] "Cold Station 12" [...] and [...] "The Augments" [...] were subsequently ranked the sixth best story of Enterprise by Den of Geek writer James Hunt. Viewing of [...] "Cold Station 12" [...] was included alongside the Doctor Who episode [...] "The Beast Below" [...] in the course [...] "Captain Picard Meets Dr. Who" [...] at the University of Dubuque to demonstrate the idea of sacrificing one person to save many.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{was also}} known as a staunch Tory; he {{admitted}} to sympathies for the Jacobite cause during his younger years but, by the reign of George III, he came to accept the Hanoverian Succession. It was Boswell who gave people the impression that Johnson was an [...] "arch-conservative", and it was Boswell, more than anyone else, who determined how Johnson would be seen by people years later. However, Boswell was not around for two of Johnson's most politically active periods: during Walpole's control over British Parliament and during the Seven Years' War. Although Boswell was present with Johnson during the 1770s and describes four major pamphlets written by Johnson, he neglects to <b>discuss</b> <b>them</b> because he is more interested in their travels to Scotland. This is {{compounded by the fact that}} Boswell held an opinion contradictory to two of these pamphlets, The False Alarm and Taxation No Tyranny, and so attacks Johnson's views in his biography.|$|E

500|$|Both Margaret Salinger and Maynard {{characterized}} the author as a devoted film buff. According to Margaret, his favorite movies include Gigi (1958), The Lady Vanishes (1938), The 39 Steps (1935; Phoebe's favorite movie in The Catcher in the Rye), and the comedies of W.C. Fields, Laurel and Hardy, and the Marx Bros.. Predating VCRs, Salinger had an extensive collection of classic movies from the 1940s in 16mm prints. Maynard wrote that [...] "he loves movies, not films", and Salinger argued that her father's [...] "worldview is, essentially, {{a product of}} the movies of his day. To my father, all Spanish speakers are Puerto Rican washerwomen, or the toothless, grinning-gypsy types in a Marx Brothers movie". Lillian Ross, a staff writer for The New Yorker and longtime friend of Salinger's, wrote following his death, [...] "Salinger loved movies, and he was more fun than anyone to <b>discuss</b> <b>them</b> with. He enjoyed watching actors work, and he enjoyed knowing them. (He loved Anne Bancroft, hated Audrey Hepburn, and said that he had seen Grand Illusion ten times.)" ...|$|E
