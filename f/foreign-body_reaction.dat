50|$|The goal of implantable microelectrodes is to {{interface}} with the body’s nervous system for recording and sending bioelectrical signals to study disease, improve prostheses, and monitor clinical parameters.

Michigan probes have been used in large-scale recordings and network analysis of neuronal assemblies, and the Utah electrode array has been used as a brain-computer interface for the paralyzed. Extracellular microelectrodes have been patterned onto an inflatable helix-shaped plastic in cochlear implants to improve deeper insertion and better electrode-tissue contact for transduction of high-fidelity sounds.

This specific biomaterial is used for the construction of nerve guides, which can be used in the reconstruction of short nerve gaps.

Because the results of earlier studies aimed at modulating the <b>foreign-body</b> <b>reaction</b> in AO rats by local or systemic treatment with anti-IFN-gamma were not completely unambiguous, we extended our in investigations to IFN-gamma-receptor knock-out (KO) mice. Several parameters (i. e., macrophages, giant cells, T-cells, B-cells, granulocytes, expression of MHC class II, stroma formation, and degradation and calcification of the biomaterial) were compared between wild-type (WT) and KO mice. Remarkably, the <b>foreign-body</b> <b>reaction</b> was very similar in WT and KO mice. in both, giant cells were formed, but in contrast to previous results in AO rats, phagocytosis of HDSC bundles occurred hardly at all up to 9 weeks, and MHC class II expression was minimal.

Granulocytes, mainly eosinophils, were present at all explantation time points. Because of the similar results in WT and KO mice, we question whether IFN-gamma plays a role at all in the <b>foreign-body</b> <b>reaction</b> in mice. (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|E

40|$|Subcutaneous {{implantation}} of biodegradable hexamethylenediisocyanate crosslinked dermal sheep collagen (HDSC) elicited little <b>foreign-body</b> <b>reaction</b> in mice {{in contrast}} to rats. If the factor(s) resulting in this minor <b>foreign-body</b> <b>reaction</b> are better understood, this knowledge {{can be used to}} modulate unwanted foreign-body reactions. Therefore, we investigated whether the phagocytic potential of murine macrophages and giant cells could be enhanced. Disks of HDSC were predegraded with collagenase or impregnated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) before implantation in 129 SVEV mice. Explantation was performed on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 and the disks were evaluated at the (immuno) light and transmission electron-microscopic levels. More giant cells were present in the predegraded disks. Cells were associated with the HDSC bundles, and the onset of phagocytosis started on day 28, {{in contrast to}} the controls and the disks impregnated with the cytokines. Expression of MHC class II was minimal in all groups. The matrix metalloproteinases MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 were expressed in all groups although on day 28 MMP- 9 expression was higher in the predegraded disks. Thus, predegradation only slightly enhanced the onset of the <b>foreign-body</b> <b>reaction</b> to HDSC in mice, and impregnation with cytokines not at all. This suggests that lack of proteolytic enzymes or TNF-alpha or IFN-gamma is not the cause of the impaired onset of the <b>foreign-body</b> <b>reaction.</b> (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|E

To compare the vascularization of the capsules surrounding the foam implants. To investigate if the capsule of polyurethane foam implanted has {{greater amount of}} collagen than that of silicone foam. METHODS: Sixty-four young male Wistar rats were allocated into two groups: polyurethane foam and silicone foam. Subcutaneous discs were implanted into the dorsum of the animals in both groups. The capsules were assessed 28 days, two months, three months and six months postoperatively. Microscopic analysis with H&E stain was performed to evaluate the acute and chronic inflammatory process, <b>foreign-body</b> <b>reaction</b> and neovascularization. The analysis with picrosirius red was performed using the ImageProPlus software, to measure the number of vessels and collagen types I and III. RESULTS: There were no statistical {{differences between the two}} groups regarding the acute and chronic inflammatory processes. All rats from the polyurethane group, in all times, exhibited moderate or intense <b>foreign-body</b> <b>reaction,</b> with statistic significant difference (p= 0. 046) when compared with the silicone group, in which the reaction was either mild or nonexistent at two months. Vascular proliferation was significantly different between the groups at 28 days (p= 0. 0002), with the polyurethane group displaying greater neovascularization with H&E stain. Similar results were obtained with picrosirius red, which revealed in the polyurethane group a much greater number of vessels than in the silicone group (p= 0. 001). The collagen area was larger in the polyurethane group, significantly at 28 days (p= 0. 001) and at two months (p= 0. 030). CONCLUSIONS: Polyurethane foam elicited more intense <b>foreign-body</b> <b>reaction</b> when compared with silicone foam.

30|$|Plantar fascia (PF) {{disorders}} commonly cause heel {{pain and}} disability {{in the general}} population. Imaging is often required to confirm diagnosis. This review article aims to provide simple and systematic guidelines for imaging assessment of PF disease, focussing on key findings detectable on plain radiography, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Sonographic characteristics of plantar fasciitis include PF thickening, loss of fibrillar structure, perifascial collections, calcifications and hyperaemia on Doppler imaging. Thickening and signal changes in the PF as well as oedema of adjacent soft tissues and bone marrow can be assessed on MRI. Radiographic findings of plantar fasciitis include PF thickening, cortical irregularities and abnormalities in the fat pad located deep below the PF. Plantar fibromatosis appears as well-demarcated, nodular thickenings that are iso-hypoechoic on ultrasound and show low-signal intensity on MRI. PF tears present with partial or complete fibre interruption on both ultrasound and MRI. Imaging description of further PF disorders, including xanthoma, diabetic fascial disease, <b>foreign-body</b> <b>reactions</b> and plantar infections, is detailed in the main text.

40|$|Biodegradable {{materials}} perhaps hold much of {{the future}} potential for many biomedical applications due to their advantages when compared to non degradable materials, {{both in terms of}} their foreign body reaction and in their gradual elimination and therefore replacement. The stimulus or source of a tissue reaction is always present with non degradable biomaterials and might be the queue for chronic inflammation often culminating with failure. Natural-origin biodegradable materials have emerged, due to their similarities with biological systems, as having additional advantages over synthetic materials. In fact, natural-origin polymeric materials are generally more susceptible to enzymatic degradation and many of the enzymes responsible for that process are present in the human body. The degradation products are often comprised of molecules that can be incorporated in normal metabolic processes. In addition, it would be expected that any other molecules/fragments resulting from the degradation of natural origin implants, because of their nature, could be easily eliminated from the surrounding tissues, thus minimizing inflammation. However, several other aspects should be analyzed and taken into account when considering <b>foreign-body</b> <b>reactions</b> to biomaterials.
