To analyze how we improve forest roads landscape and the economic benefits of <b>forest</b> road <b>maintenance,</b> Tuan-fon <b>forest</b> road (Daton village of Yilan county) and Aua-wan-da connecting route (Jen-ai village of Nan-tou county) Result of the {{research is}} as follows: 1. There should be a basic database of Taiwan's forest road and proper goal / plan of design of forest road's density; so that we can make the forestry management more the modern, Furthermore, the evaluation standard of the abandoned, forest roads should be built up to assure the safety of national forest lands. 2. When concerning the constructive method of the forest roads' safety protection, we should adopt more ecology-friendly methods of construction, like using native specles of trees as material for construction to lessen the construction expenditure and reduce the excessive cement production installed in the mountain area; also, it could reduce CO 2 released in the air which brings about the greenhouse effect. 3. Improving the scenery of forest road connecting to national forest area and creating a higher quality of traveling environment for the national forest area should be processed continuously in order to attract more tourists and promote national competence of tourism. 4. <b>Forest</b> road's <b>maintenance,</b> analyzed according to the concrete financial income of national forest area, results in a beneficial rate of B/C < 1 and B-C< 0, so the <b>forest</b> road's <b>maintenance</b> can't meet the economic expectation.

Ministry of Environment has started the certification since 2008. The purposes of this paper were to reveal the influence of forest management and regional development by J-VER, and to discuss the problem about the operation of J-VER. Interviewing was performed to municipalities of Kyushu which obtained J-VER by forest management. The investigation revealed the following observations. About the objectives of obtaining J-VER, the objective of all the participating municipalities and prefectures was basically <b>forest</b> <b>maintenance.</b> However, two prefectures also had another objective to become the J-VER certification model, while the two municipalities’ objective was to contribute to rural development in addition to <b>forest</b> <b>maintenance.</b> About difference of the sales, Oguni and Morotsuka, which had obtained J-VER in advance, seemed to have an advantage as a pioneer. However, their sales were sluggish in general. Therefore, it is important to add another value to J-VER, take image strategy of J-VER, and perform the prefecture-led and integrated regional promotions of J-VER, to increase the sales. About difference of using the sales, Fukuoka used it for forest management, while Oguni used it to promote the forestry and share activities with urban residents. Furthermore, in Morotsuka the revenue accounted for 10 % of annual income in forest, so the J-VER interest will be important for forest management especially in a disadvantaged area if they can sell more...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} novel {{algorithm}} for robot motion planning in dynamic environments. Our approach extends Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) in several ways. We assume {{the need to}} simultaneously plan and maintain paths for multiple tasks {{with respect to the}} current state of a moving robot in a dynamic environment. Our algorithm dynamically maintains a forest of trees by splitting, growing and merging them on the fly to adapt to moving obstacles and robot motion. In order to minimize tree maintenance, we only validate the task paths, rather than the entire forest. The root of the inhabited tree moves with the robot. Dynamic re-planning is integrated with tree and <b>forest</b> <b>maintenance.</b> Coupling the robot motion with the planner enables us to support multiple tasks, for example providing an “escape ” path while moving to a goal. The robot is free to move along whichever task path it chooses. We highlight the work by showing fast results in simulated environments with moving obstacles. I...|$|E

40|$|Question: Are long-unburnt {{patches of}} {{eucalypt}} forest important for maintainingfloristic diversity?Location: Eucalyptus forests of southeastern New SouthWales, Australia. Methods: Data from 976 sites representing {{a range of}} fire history from threemajor vegetation formations ¿ shrubby dry sclerophyll forest (SF), grassy dry SFand wet SF ¿ were analysed. Generalized linear models were used to examinechanges in species richness with increasing time since wildfire and analysis ofsimilarities to examine changes in community composition. Chi-squared testswere conducted to examine the distribution of individual species across fourtime since fire categories. Results: Plant species relationships to fire varied between the three formations. Shrubby dry SF supported lower plant species richness with increasing timesince wildfire and this was associated with shifts in community composition. Grassy dry SF showed significant shifts in community composition and speciesrichness in relation to time, with a peak in plant species richness 20 ¿ 30 yr postfire (either prescribed fire or wildfire). Wet SF increased in species richnessuntil 10 ¿ 20 yr post wildfire then displayed a general declining trend. Speciesrichness in each vegetation type {{was not related to}} the fire frequencies and fireintervals observed in this study. Conclusions: Long-unburnt (30 ¿ 50 yr post wildfire) forests appeared to play aminor role in the maintenance of plant species diversity in dry forest systems,although this was more significant in wet <b>forests.</b> <b>Maintenance</b> of a range of fireages within each vegetation formation will assist in maintaining floristicdiversity within regions...|$|R

In this case we use a fuzzy-logic-based system to weight and find the critical circuits on which <b>forest</b> <b>maintenance</b> should be performed. Second, we construct an objective function based on tree-to-network distances and growth patterns of trees (classified per species) in order to simulate forest maintenance; this is achieved using a genetic algorithm to determine optimum pruning cycles for a given power supply system.

40|$|Abstract Indicators {{are applied}} faster and at lower costs than {{conventional}} surveys, providing quick and efficient responses that can facilitate protected areas management. Our {{aim was to}} select indicators from vegetation to monitor protected areas. For this purpose, we analyzed understory and quantified lianas and tree ferns in protected and non-protected areas, {{in order to find}} indicator species. Our study areas are located in Vale do Ribeira, southeastern São Paulo state, Brazil. One of the areas is under two protection categories (IUCN's categories II and V), and the other is a privately owned farm. Lianas with large diameters (> 13 cm) and tree ferns with great heights (> 19 m) were considered indicators of undisturbed areas (protected areas) because their growth is directly related to forest successional stage. Indicator species within the protected area were shade tolerant species, such as Bathysa australis (A. St. -Hil.) K. Schum., whereas outside the protected area were pioneer species, such as Pera glabrata (Schott) Poepp. ex Baill. e Nectandra oppositifolia Ness.

We conducted two main analyses: resource and economic assessment. For resource assessment, we investigate whether wood supply from FMP residue is sufficient to sustainably satisfy new demand created by a local initiative in Nishiwaga, and in how much forest area can FMPs be performed to satisfy the demand. These questions are analyzed by linear programming. Regarding economic assessment, we investigate whether replacement of fossil fuel by wood energy brings economic benefit to a user and local economy using input–output analysis. Our overall findings demonstrated that the use of wood energy under underutilized situations can lead to an increase of implementations of FMPs and of domestic wood resource supplies from a short-term perspective that comes from residues of the FMPs. We also found that wood energy consumption introduces co-benefits in terms of reduced heating costs for users and a larger economic impact on the local economy than fossil fuel...|$|E
