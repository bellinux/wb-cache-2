50|$|To {{make it easy}} to {{distribute}} middleware, T-Kernel has separate specification for subsystem and device driver which will be suitable for different types of middleware APIs. A real-time OS appropriate for individual application can be created by combining the middleware called T-Kernel Extension with the T-Kernel. T-Monitor initializes hardware and handles the <b>interrupt</b> <b>set</b> up at the start. T-Monitor lessens hardware-dependency of T-Kernel, and improves the application portability. T-Kernel consists of the following three components from the viewpoint of functionality.|$|R

50|$|There are comedy {{schools that}} work with new comics to {{workshop}} material. Comics work to overcome stage fright and better their writing skills by helping their classmates improve their sets. Some schools, like Manhattan Comedy School, offer improvisation classes for comics {{so that they are}} more comfortable with straying from written material. Improv also helps comics think more quickly when dealing with hecklers. Hecklers are people who <b>interrupt</b> <b>sets,</b> usually with negative comments or gibes. Improv is also key when doing crowd work, which is when comics interact directly with the audience.|$|R

5000|$|On the Nintendo Entertainment System, an NMI is {{generated}} during each vertical blanking interval. Because these NMIs (often {{referred to as}} [...] "vblank interrupts") occur at frequent, regular intervals, code that manipulates game graphics and audio is often executed inside of the NMI handler routine. Clearing the 7th bit of the PPU's $2000 register disables vblank <b>interrupts,</b> and <b>setting</b> it enables them.|$|R
50|$|Heckling is the {{shouting}} of an uninvited comment, usually disparaging, at a performance or event, that <b>interrupts</b> <b>set</b> pieces or performances. While slam poetry has, from its beginnings, been about audience participation, PuroSlam has taken that concept {{and pushed it}} to its limits. Unlike typical open mic poetry readings, where audience members are encouraged to sit quietly {{until the end of}} the poem, at which point they are encouraged to clap politely (see golf clap), PuroSlam implores its audience to respond immediately. If they like what they hear, the audience claps, cheers, hoots, and hollers in immediate appreciation of the performance on stage. similarly, if they do not like what they hear, the audience boos, hisses, makes noise, talks, heckles, or outright ignores the poet while they do other things. It is the policy of PuroSlam that if the poet cannot earn the audience's attention through her words and performance, then it is the audience's right to respond as they see fit.|$|R

When Joe was hauled off by Joni's manager, the audience began to boo until Mitchell made an emotional appeal to them for some respect for the performers. Contrary to popular belief, Joe was not the man who was ranting about a [...] "psychedelic concentration camp". That was another incident that took place the previous day. After the crowd quieted down, Mitchell closed her set with [...] "Big Yellow Taxi".|$|R
40|$|Background: The SET (Su(var) 3 - 9, Enhancer-of-zeste, Trithorax) domain is an {{evolutionarily}} {{conserved sequence}} of approximately 130 - 150 amino acids, and constitutes the catalytic site of lysine methyltransferases (KMTs). KMTs perform many crucial biological functions via histone methylation of chromatin. Histone methylation marks are interpreted differently {{depending on the}} histone type (i. e. H 3 or H 4), the lysine position (e. g. H 3 K 4, H 3 K 9, H 3 K 27, H 3 K 36 or H 4 K 20) {{and the number of}} added methyl groups (i. e. me 1, me 2 or me 3). For example, H 3 K 4 me 3 and H 3 K 36 me 3 are associated with transcriptional activation, but H 3 K 9 me 2 and H 3 K 27 me 3 are associated with gene silencing. The substrate specificity and activity of KMTs are determined by sequences within the SET domain and other regions of the protein. Results: Here we identified 49 SET-domain proteins from the recently sequenced Brassica rapa genome. We performed sequence similarity and protein domain organization analysis of these proteins, along with the SETdomain proteins from the dicot Arabidopsis thaliana, the monocots Oryza sativa and Brachypodium distachyon, and the green alga Ostreococcus tauri. We showed that plant SET-domain proteins can be grouped into 6 distinct classes, namely KMT 1, KMT 2, KMT 3, KMT 6, KMT 7 and S-ET. Apart from the S-ET class, which has an <b>interrupted</b> <b>SET</b> domain and may be involved in methylation of nonhistone proteins, the other classes have characteristics o...|$|R
50|$|The {{story begins}} in a {{pastoral}} <b>setting</b> <b>interrupted</b> by a telegraph pole. Soon after, a railway is put through the field, which further ruptures the tranquility of the bucolic countryside and foreshadows {{the ending of}} the tale. Eventually the family's economic situation forces the father to sell the cow, which is taken away on the train for slaughter and gives the work its name.|$|R
50|$|The Brygos Painter {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{productive}} painters of his generation; more than 200 vases have been attributed to him. Apart from kylikes, he also painted other vase shapes, such as skyphoi, kantharoi, rhyta, a kalathos-like vessel with a pouring spout and a number of lekythoi. By far the majority of his works were kylikes of the types B and C. The latter were often executed without maeander base lines; the former frequently stood on conical bases. The maeanders around his tondo paintings are rarely continuous, most are <b>interrupted</b> by <b>sets</b> or rows of crosses. Apart from his red-figure work, the Brygos Painter is known to have produced some white-ground vases.|$|R
50|$|Life in the priory is {{characterized}} by prayer, reading and manual work, the three basic elements of Trappist life. The rhythm {{of the day is}} <b>interrupted</b> at <b>set</b> hours for celebrating the Liturgy of the Hours. These seven prayer services which take place throughout the day are accessible to everyone, both guests and visitors. On each day there is considerable time foreseen for mental reading, Lectio Divina. As in all other communities, the nuns work for their daily bread. Throughout the years some small businesses have been developed, such as brewer's yeast, hand-woven ornaments, candles, herb salve, massage oil and greeting cards. There is also a small guesthouse where women who seek silence and prayer can stay a few days. The priory cannot be visited casually, however.|$|R

The instruction list includes skip on flag; clear the flag, clear the clock, and stop the clock; and preset the counter with {{the contents of the}} accumulator and start the clock. The clock counts at a rate determined by an external oscillator and causes an <b>interrupt</b> and <b>sets</b> a flag when a 12 -bit overflow occurs. An overflow can occur after 1 to 4096 counts. The clock can be built for a total parts cost of less than $ 100 including power supply and I/O connector. Slight modification can be made to permit its use on larger machines (16 bit, 24 bit, etc.) and logic level shifting can be made to make it compatible with any computer...|$|R
5|$|Due to {{similarities}} between the perpetrators, the murders were compared by Czech media and experts to a mass murder that took place two years before in Frenštát pod Radhoštěm, another Moravian town lying 90km northwards. In the attack, a 57-year-old man, Antonín Blažek, attempted {{to blow up a}} block of flats after having been ordered to vacate his flat that had been foreclosed by creditors. He first blocked both exits from the building, and then removed and opened the main gas supply into the building's corridor. <b>Interrupted,</b> Blažek <b>set</b> the gas on fire before the gas could spread throughout the whole building. The explosion and subsequent fire, however, were large enough to demolish part of the building, killing Blažek and five other people immediately and wounding eleven others, one of whom died on 17 February 2015.|$|R

5000|$|In 1935 three Ornamental Sets A, B and C were {{introduced}} that contained decorative parts {{to supplement the}} existing sets, including pillars, arches and mottled green roofs. In 1936 a [...] "Set 6" [...] was introduced, a much larger set than [...] "Set 5" [...] that included all the new ornamental parts. All the bricks in this set, initially, were 'Oak', a mottled brown colour made {{by the addition of}} sawdust to the resin, and sets like this were, and indeed remain, much cherished. In 1937 the familiar, long-lived colour scheme of red and white bricks with green windows was implemented for the standard sets. In late 1937, or early 1938, [...] "Set 6" [...] was also changed to the new standard colours and a conversion set, [...] "set 5A", was introduced. However, until wartime austerity <b>interrupted,</b> any <b>set</b> could still be ordered in 'Oak'.|$|R
2500|$|It is {{possible}} to change the mode of operation for the FIRQ interrupt.

50|$|As can be seen, at {{the bottom}} level is the microkernel, which is about 4,000 lines of code (mostly in C, plus {{a small amount of}} {{assembly}} language). It handles interrupts, scheduling, and message passing. It also supports an application programming interface (API) of about 30 kernel calls that authorized servers and drivers can make. User programs cannot make these calls. Instead, they can issue POSIX system calls which send messages to the servers. The kernel calls perform functions such as <b>setting</b> <b>interrupts</b> and copying data between address spaces.|$|R

50|$|Often, the {{graphics}} chips used in home computers and video game consoles had limited capabilities. Raster interrupts {{were incorporated into}} these video chips allowing skilled programmers to transcend these limitations. A software-serviced <b>interrupt</b> would be <b>set</b> to trigger when a given screen line was refreshed, and the interrupt routine could then reload the chip's registers. In doing so, {{the graphics}} chip state could be changed at a specific screen position allowing sprites to be repositioned, additional colors inserted, or graphics modes to be changed giving the graphics hardware the appearance of greater capability than it was inherently endowed.|$|R
5000|$|The Nintendo Entertainment System's PPU {{graphics}} chip {{does not}} support true raster interrupts - an <b>interrupt</b> can be <b>set</b> to trigger during the vertical blank interval, but not at any arbitrary scan line - instead required polling of a [...] "hit flag" [...] that indicated when the first sprite was being drawn. Although early games like Super Mario Bros., Castlevania, and The Legend of Zelda managed to produce effective split-screen scrolling with this method, it is CPU-intensive. Some later cartridges incorporated MMC circuitry (most prominently Nintendo's MMC3 chip) that kept track of the PPU's address and data lines and generated raster interrupts.|$|R
