It is estimated above at 20,000 square miles, and has been described in enthusiastic terms, by the Bishop of Oregon--De Smet--in his [...] "Oregon Missions." [...] The territory of the Kootonais Indians would seem, from his glowing description, to be divided in favourable proportion between forests and prairies. Of timber, he names birch, pine of different species, cedar, and cypress. He remarked specimens of coal, and [...] "great quantities of lead," [...] apparently mixed with silver. The source of the Columbia seemed to impress him as [...] "a very important point." [...] He observes that [...] "the climate is delightful"--that the extremes of heat and cold are seldom known, the snow disappearing as it falls. He reiterates the opinion [...] "that the advantages nature seemed to have bestowed on the Columbia, will render its geographical position very important at some future day, and that the hand of civilised man would transform it into a terrestrial paradise." ...|$|E

5000|$|In most {{inhabited}} areas, common timbers can be {{made into}} high-quality self bows. The pieces must be long enough (approximately {{the height of the}} archer), and the grain must be sufficiently straight. Denser timbers normally store energy better and {{can be made}} into narrower bows with less effort - high-quality yew allows for particularly narrow self bows, such as the traditional European version of the longbow. The Eastern Woodlands tribes of North America used hickory, tribes in parts of the Midwestern United States osage orange, Native Americans of the west coast used short, wide, recurved bows made of American Pacific yew, Brazilian rainforest tribes used palm wood, and many others. In Europe and North America, common woods such as maple, ash, elm, and oak make excellent <b>flat</b> <b>bows,</b> and are far easier to obtain than good-quality yew.|$|R
60|$|He, {{and every}} thing {{connected}} with him {{were very different}} from our New York pilot. In the first place, the pilot boat that brought him was a plethoric looking sloop-rigged boat, with <b>flat</b> <b>bows,</b> that went wheezing through the water; quite {{in contrast to the}} little gull of a schooner, that bade us adieu off Sandy Hook. Aboard of her were ten or twelve other pilots, fellows with shaggy brows, and muffled in shaggy coats, who sat grouped together on deck like a fire-side of bears, wintering in Aroostook. They must have had fine sociable times, though, together; cruising about the Irish Sea in quest of Liverpool-bound vessels; smoking cigars, drinking brandy-and-water, and spinning yarns; till at last, one by one, they are all scattered on board of different ships, and meet again by the side of a blazing sea-coal fire in some Liverpool taproom, and prepare for another yachting.|$|R

50|$|The McKenzie River dory, or drift boat, is an {{adaptation}} of the open-water dory converted for use in rivers. A variant of the boat's hull is called a modified McKenzie dory or Rogue River dory. The McKenzie designs are characterized by a wide, flat bottom, flared sides, a narrow, <b>flat</b> <b>bow,</b> and a pointed stern. The sole identifying characteristic of the McKenzie River dory is a continuous rocker (the arc from bow to stern {{along the bottom of}} the boat).

50|$|As war was {{the most}} prestigious {{activity}} in Viking Age Scandinavia, beautifully finished weapons were an important way for a warrior to display his wealth and status. A wealthy Viking would likely have a complete ensemble of a spear, a wooden shield, and either a battle axe or a sword. The very richest might have a helmet; other armour {{is thought to have}} been limited to the nobility and their professional warriors. The average farmer was likely limited to a spear, shield, and perhaps a common axe or a large knife or seax. Some would also bring their hunting bows (mostly long bow or <b>flat</b> <b>bow)</b> to use in the opening stages of battle.|$|E

The common design of two circles and a chevron near {{the rear of}} the bow is often {{interpreted}} as a wolf’s head. The Thracian Anchor type has a wide crescent at the head giving the fibula an anchor shape. The Thracian Anchor type is also called the Illyrian and is found in Pannonia (Hungary), Dacia (Romania) and Serbia.|$|R
5000|$|The kite {{was invented}} in China, {{possibly}} {{as far back as}} the 5th century BC by Mozi (also Mo Di) and Lu Ban (also Gongshu Ban). These leaf kites were constructed by stretching silk over a split bamboo framework. The earliest known Chinese kites were <b>flat</b> (not <b>bowed)</b> and often rectangular. Later, tailless kites incorporated a stabilizing bowline. Designs often emulated flying insects, birds, and other beasts, both real and mythical. Some were fitted with strings and whistles to make musical sounds while flying.|$|R
40|$|Recognition of {{deformities}} and {{corrective exercise}} is {{a branch of}} physical education which intends to emend and treat various muscular weaknesses and deformities using proper and accurate corrective exercise and sports scientific principles. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of regular corrective exercise on skeletal deformities such as scoliosis, shoulders dropping, <b>flat</b> foot and <b>bow</b> leg in secondary school male students of Khorramabad city as the statistical population. Materials and Methods: 160 girls in khorramabad city, aged 12 - 14 years, participated in this study. The subjects were examined twice before and after 24 sessions of corrective exercise. Deformities were measured by grid plane, plumb line and other relevant tests. The gathered data were analyzed by descriptive statistical methods including: frequency, percentage and graphs. Results: In 12 years old sbjects the degree of shoulders dropping, <b>flat</b> foot and <b>bow</b> leg in post- test were lower than pre-test and differences were significant (F= 7. 96, P< 0. 001 & F= 100. 1, P< 0. 001 & F= 27. 63, P 0. 001). The differences between pre and post measurments of shoulders dropping, <b>flat</b> foot and <b>bow</b> leg in 13 years old cases were significant (F= 100. 1, P< 0. 001 & F= 27. 63, P< 0. 001 F= 7. 96, P 0. 001). Finally in 14 years old subjects for shoulders dropping, <b>flat</b> foot and <b>bow</b> leg, differences between pre and post- test were significant (F= 7. 96, P< 0. 001 & F= 100. 1, P< 0. 001 & F= 27. 63, P 0. 001).

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{a novel approach}} to measuring anterior chamber angle dimensions and configurations. Methods: Sixty-nine images were selected randomly from the ultrasound biomicroscopic image database to develop the algorithm. Thirty images were selected for further analyses. The value of each pixel of the 8 -bit grayscale ultrasound biomicroscopic images was quantized into 0 (black) or 1 (white), and the edge points outlining the angle were detected and fitted with straight lines. The dimensions and profiles of anterior chamber angles were then measured. Results: The algorithm failed to identify the edge points correctly in 8 (11. 6 %) of 69 images because of strong background noise. Three basic types of angle configuration were identified based on the derived angle profiles: constant, increasing, and decreasing, which corresponded to <b>flat,</b> <b>bowed</b> forward, and bowed backward iris contours, respectively. The angle measurements demonstrated high correlation with trabecular-iris angle and angle opening distance 500 (calculated as {{the distance from the}} corneal endothelium to the anterior iris surface perpendicular to a line drawn at 500 μm from the scleral spur). The strongest association was found between the averaged angle derived from the angle profile and the angle opening distance 500 (r= 0. 91). Conclusion: The proposed algorithm has high correlations with angle opening distance and trabecular-iris angle with the added advantages of being fully automated, reproducible, and able to capture the characteristic angle configurations. However, good-quality ultrasound biomicroscopic images with high signal-to-noise ratio are required to identify the edge points correctly. © 2006 American Medical Association.
