5|$|Yeasts {{have been}} used since ancient times to leaven bread and to ferment beer and wine. More recently, mould fungi have been {{exploited}} to create {{a wide range of}} industrial products, including enzymes and drugs. Medicines based on fungi include antibiotics, immunosuppressants, statins and many anti-cancer drugs. The yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an important model organism in cell biology. The fruiting bodies of some larger fungi are collected as edible mushrooms, including delicacies like the chanterelle, cep, and truffle, while a few species are cultivated. Mould fungi provide the meaty (umami) flavour of <b>fermented</b> <b>soybean</b> products such as tempeh, miso and soy sauce, and contribute flavour and colour to blue cheeses including Roquefort and Stilton. Moulds also yield vegetarian meat substitutes like Quorn. Some fungi, especially the fly agaric and psilocybin mushrooms are used for the psychoactive drugs that they contain; these in particular are the focus of academic study in the field of ethnomycology.|$|E

25|$|Manipuri cuisine is {{represented}} by the cuisine of the Meitei people who form the majority population in the central plain. Meitei food are simple, tasty, organic and healthy. Rice with local seasonal vegetables and fish form the main diet. Most of the dishes are cooked like vegetable stew, flavored with either fermented fish called ngari, or dried and smoked fish. The most popular manipuri dish is the iromba; it's a preparation of boiled and mashed vegetables, often including potatoes or beans, mixed with chilli and roasted fermented fish. Another popular dish is the savory cake called Paknam, made of a base of lentil flour stuffed with various ingredients such as banana inflorescence, mushrooms, fish, vegetables etc., and baked covered in turmeric leaves. Along with spicy dishes, a mild side dish of steamed or boiled sweet vegetables are often served in the daily meals. The manipuri salad dish called singju, made of finely julienned cabbage, green papaya, and other vegetables, and garnished with local herbs, toasted sesame powder and lentil flour is extremely popular locally, and often found sold in small street side vendors. Singju is often served with bora which are fritters of various kinds, and also kanghou, or oil fried spicy veggies. Cooked and <b>fermented</b> <b>soybean</b> is a popular condiment in all manipuri kitchens.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{relationship}} between the consumption of dietary fiber or fermented foods and depressive symptoms was investigated. The degree of depressive symptoms was measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression（ CES-D） scale, and consumption of foods was measured by a self-administered diet history questionnaire. Participants scoring less than 16 were considered as the low CES-D score group, and those scoring 16 or higher were considered as the high CES-D score group. The total intake of dietary fiber from potatoes, pulses, fungi, vegetables, and fruits was not significantly different between the low and high CES-D score groups, but was significantly different for the frequency of the consumption of yogurt or <b>fermented</b> <b>soybeans.</b> Additionally, no participant who had eaten <b>fermented</b> <b>soybeans</b> daily was in the high CES-D score group. In conclusion, the frequency of the consumption of yogurt or <b>fermented</b> <b>soybeans</b> may be negatively associated with depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the habit of eating <b>fermented</b> <b>soybeans</b> daily may be associated with scoring less than 16 on the CES-D scale in Japanese adults...|$|R

50|$|Menaquinone-7 is {{synthesized}} by bacteria during fermentation and {{is found}} in <b>fermented</b> <b>soybeans</b> (nattō), and in most fermented cheeses. In nattō, none of the vitamin K is from menaquinone-4, and in cheese only 2-7% is. The richest source of natural K2 is the traditional Japanese dish natto made of <b>fermented</b> <b>soybeans</b> and Bacillus subtilis, which provides an unusually rich source of K2 as long-chain MK-7: its consumption in Northern Japan {{has been linked to}} significant improvement in vitamin K status and bone health in many studies. The intense smell and strong taste, however, make this soya food a less attractive source of K2 for Westerners' tastes. Supplement food companies sell nattō extract, standardized for K2 content, in capsules. It is not known whether B. subtilis will produce K2 with other legumes (chickpeas, beans, lentils).|$|R
