5|$|The Norwegian Parliament gave 400,000 kroner {{in support}} in 1873, and doubled it the {{following}} year. By then, the Swedish authorities {{had decided that}} all railways should be built in standard gauge, and the Norwegian Parliament chose to change their configuration to the same gauge in 1874, increasing estimated costs from 4.7 to 8.9 million kroner. This was a similar arrangement to what would <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> two international lines in Eastern Norway, where the Kongsvinger and Østfold Lines were also built with standard gauge. Despite intense lobbying from representatives from Innherred, the Verdal alternative was finally discarded when parliament gave 3 million kroner to the Meråker Line.|$|E
5|$|Daniels and Schur {{wrote the}} script for the pilot episode in mid-2008. The {{original}} script portrayed Leslie and Mark as slightly less likable than they appeared in the final draft. For example, in the premiere episode, Mark asks Ron to greenlight the park because he is inspired by Leslie's optimism and wants to help her. In the original script, Mark intervened because he was attracted to Ann and wanted an excuse to keep seeing her. The characters were made more likable in response to feedback the episode received from focus groups and press tour screenings. The first-season episodes were written and developed relatively quickly after each other, and Schur said the staff was treating the entire six-episode season {{as if it was}} one television pilot. When the season concluded, the writers had not decided what would <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> developing romantic plotlines between Leslie and Mark, or Mark and Ann.|$|E
25|$|On September 29, 2016, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan disputed Treaty of Lausanne. He said “We {{gave away}} the islands (in the Aegean) through the Treaty of Lausanne,”, “The islands, which if we care to shout (from the western Asia Minor coast) we’ll {{be heard on}} the other side (the islands), we gave away with Lausanne. What will now <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{continental}} shelf? What will <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> airspace and land? We’re still fighting for all of these". This caused displeasure in Athens. A Greek Foreign Ministry source remarked that “everyone should respect the Treaty of Lausanne,” noting that it is “a reality in the civilized world which no one, including Ankara, can ignore.”, added that the Turkish leader’s comments were likely geared for domestic consumption.|$|E

Non-Zionists believed that Jews should integrate into the countries in which they lived, rather than moving to the Land of Israel. The original founders of Reform Judaism in Germany rejected traditional prayers {{for the restoration of}} Jerusalem. The view among Reform Jews that Judaism was strictly a religion, and that Jews should be loyal citizens of their host nations, led to a non-Zionist, and sometimes anti-Zionist, stance.|$|E

500|$|... "Talking film is {{as little}} needed as a singing book." [...] Such was the blunt {{proclamation}} of critic Viktor Shklovsky, {{one of the}} leaders of the Russian formalist movement, in 1927. While some regarded sound as irreconcilable with film art, others saw it as opening a new field of creative opportunity. The following year, a group of Soviet filmmakers, including Sergei Eisenstein, proclaimed that the use of image and sound in juxtaposition, the so-called contrapuntal method, would raise the cinema to [...] "...unprecedented power and cultural height. Such a method for constructing the sound-film will not confine it to a national market, as must <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> photographing of plays, but will give a greater possibility than ever before for the circulation throughout the world of a filmically expressed idea." [...] So far as one segment of the audience was concerned, however, the introduction of sound brought a virtual end to such circulation: Elizabeth C. Hamilton writes, [...] "Silent films offered people who were deaf a rare opportunity to participate in a public discourse, cinema, on equal terms with hearing people. The emergence of sound film effectively separated deaf from hearing audience members once again." ...|$|E

500|$|If {{isolation}} is high, directional couplers {{are good for}} combining signals to feed a single line to a receiver for two-tone receiver tests. [...] In figure 20, one signal enters port P3 and one enters port P2, while both exit port P1. [...] The signal from port P3 to port P1 will experience [...] of loss, and the signal from port P2 to port P1 will have [...] loss. [...] The internal load on the isolated port will dissipate the signal losses from port P3 and port P2. [...] If the isolators in figure 20 are neglected, the isolation measurement (port P2 to port P3) determines the amount of power from the signal generator F2 that will be injected into the signal generator F1. [...] As the injection level increases, it may cause modulation of signal generator F1, or even injection phase locking. [...] Because of the symmetry of the directional coupler, the reverse injection will <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same possible modulation problems of signal generator F2 by F1. [...] Therefore, the isolators are used in figure 20 to effectively increase the isolation (or directivity) of the directional coupler. [...] Consequently, the injection loss will be {{the isolation of the}} directional coupler plus the reverse isolation of the isolator.|$|E
500|$|The second Kanon anime {{series was}} {{reviewed}} at Anime News Network where Theron Martin commented how {{the series is}} a [...] "formulaic moe haremfest", and how the moe aspects of the series may make viewers [...] "feel like they're drowning in a vat of gooey cuteness". The series is described as being similar to the anime television adaptation of Air, saying [...] "Like Air, the first four episodes can be simply summarized as 'male lead arrives in town and kills time interacting with cute girls.' Unlike Air, however, these interactions can occasionally be very funny." [...] Martin also compares Kanon to the anime adaptation of Shuffle! which is described as [...] "bombing" [...] where Kanon [...] "works". The reviewer chalks this up to the characters [...] "endear themselves to the viewer...far better than what Shuffle!s do." [...] Martin cites the transition between humor and serious content as {{a defining feature of}} the series. However, Martin comments how one of the series' flaws is how it [...] "overplays the mundane cutesiness and moe cards at times" [...] causing little to <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> plot. Yuichi is described as being [...] "too erratic to be fully credible" [...] or easily believable. Despite the series' drawbacks, Martin still describes the series as [...] "one of the best moe-centric series to date" [...] and lauds Kyoto Animation's production values making Kanon [...] "one of the prettiest-looking anime series of the past year". Martin adds another series comparison, citing Kanon as the [...] "polar opposite of Gurren Lagann", which deals primarily in its action-oriented content.|$|E
500|$|From the {{beginning}} of production, Atlus staff saw Shin Megami Tensei {{as a chance to}} develop a game with the company's brand on it. The main staff included director Yōsuke Niino, producer Hideyuki Yokoyama, programmer and future Megami Tensei director Kouji Okada, writers Ryutaro Ito and Kazunari Suzuki, and composer Tsukasa Masuko. Kazuma Kaneko worked on multiple aspects of the game, including character and sprite design, the world's concept and visual design, and the creation of visual assets. Atlus saw the game as a remake of the previous game in the Megami Tensei series, [...] As such, the staff knew what would <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> story, so development went smoothly. An early factor in the game was the inclusion of a Law Hero and a Chaos Hero, and a protagonist who would initially be neutral and whose actions would affect their alignment. Kaneko defined this blending of different alignments as [...] "a sort of hodgepodge" [...] when compared to future games in the series. When designing it, the team slowly decided that they wanted to break the then-current gaming status quo using its aesthetic and content. That feeling, along with granting it a sense of reality through use of dark imagery, would later define the series. The main theme of Shin Megami Tensei was a person waking up to inevitable destruction and being able to do nothing but rely on their own abilities. The scenario {{took a long time to}} finalize, being revised a number of times by multiple staff members. During earlier drafts, it was planned that the finale of the story would take place in Israel after an extensive journey across Japan.|$|E

2500|$|First, Hume ponders the {{discovery}} of causal relations, which {{form the basis for}} what he refers to as [...] "matters of fact". He argues that causal relations are found not by reason, but by induction. This is because for any cause, multiple effects are conceivable, and the actual effect cannot be determined by reasoning about the cause; instead, one must observe occurrences of the causal relation to discover that it holds. For example, when one thinks of [...] "a billiard ball moving in a straight line toward another", one can conceive that the first ball bounces back with the second ball remaining at rest, the first ball stops and the second ball moves, or the first ball jumps over the second, etc. There is no reason to conclude any of these possibilities over the others. Only through previous observation can it be predicted, inductively, what will actually <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> balls. In general, it is not necessary that causal relation in the future resemble causal relations in the past, as it is always conceivable otherwise; for Hume, this is because the negation of the claim does not lead to a contradiction.|$|E
