5|$|When Mansfield {{returned}} to Hollywood in mid-1960, 20th Century-Fox cast her in <b>It</b> <b>Happened</b> <b>in</b> Athens (1962). She received first billing above the title, but only {{appeared in a}} supporting role. <b>It</b> <b>Happened</b> <b>in</b> Athens starred Trax Colton, a handsome newcomer and an unknown whom Fox was trying to mold into a heartthrob. This Olympic Games-based film was shot in Greece in fall 1960, but was unreleased until June 1962. It was a box office failure, and Mansfield's 20th Century-Fox contract was dropped.|$|E

25|$|This system placed {{twice as}} much {{emphasis}} on polls than computer rankings (since there were two polls and an average of six computer rankings) and made it highly unlikely that the top team in both polls would be denied {{a place in the}} title game, as <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> the 2003–04 season.|$|E
25|$|Though {{theoretically}} {{capital punishment}} {{is still not}} abolished in Morocco, there has been only one execution since 1983, and <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> 1993. 198 people were sentenced to death between 1956 and 1993, although there was an 11-year lull in executions between January 1982 and August 1993.

25|$|The {{theory of}} new Liberalism {{did not seem}} much more piquant or fertile than the respectable old. As <b>it</b> <b>happened,</b> <b>in</b> the fulness of time our {{distinguished}} apostles of Efficiency came into supreme power, with {{a share in the}} finest field for efficient diplomacy and an armed struggle, that could have been imagined. Unhappily they broke down, or thought they had (1915), and could discover no better way out of their scrape than to seek deliverance (not without a trace of arbitrary proscription) from the opposing party that counted Liberalism, old or new, for dangerous and deluding moonshine.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the decline}} of the European eastern block during the late 1980s, {{performance}} art had actively been rejected by most communist governments. With the exception of Poland and Yugoslavia, performance art was more or less banned in countries where any independent public event was feared. In the GDR, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Latvia <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> apartments, at seemingly spontaneous gatherings in artist studios, in church-controlled settings, or covered as another activity, like a photo-shooting. Isolated of the western conceptual context, in different settings it could be like a playful protest or like a bitter comment, using subversive metaphors to express dissent with the political situation.|$|E

In addition to composing about 55 full scores for stage works, Herbert produced a considerable body of musical numbers for variety {{shows such as}} the Ziegfeld Follies and the sophisticated private entertainments for the Lambs theatrical club.|$|E

25|$|Injuries to the genital {{areas can}} be swelling, lacerations, and bruising. Common genital {{injuries}} are anal injury, labial abrasions, hymenal bruising, tears of the posterior fourchette and fossa. Genital injuries are {{more prevalent in}} post-menopausal women and prepubescent girls. Internal injuries to the cervix and vagina can be visualized using colposcopy. Using colposcopy has increased the detection of internal trauma from six percent to fifty-three percent. Genital injuries to {{children who have been}} raped or sexually assaulted differ in that the abuse may be on-going or <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> the past after the injuries heal. Scarring is one sign of the sexual abuse of children.|$|E
25|$|Provisions toward Muslim-Christian {{relations}} {{have traditionally been}} assessed by taking in view later policies. According to one prominent interpretation, this {{would mean that the}} Principalities were regarded by the Ottomans as belonging to the Dâr al ahd' ("Abode of the Covenant"), a status granted to them in exchange for material gains. Therefore, the Ottoman Empire did not maintain troops or garrisons or build military facilities. Instead, as <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> several instances, Ottoman Sultans allowed their Tatar subjects to raid Moldavia or Wallachia as a means to punish the dissent of local Princes. Literary historian Ioana Feodorov notes that the relations between the two smaller states and the Ottoman suzerain were based on a set of principles and rules to which the Ottoman Empire adhered, and indicates that, early in the 17th century, this system drew admiration from the Arabic-speaking Christian traveler Paul of Aleppo.|$|E
25|$|In July 1982, the Super Corollas and {{the visiting}} {{national}} team of South Korea {{were involved in}} a bench-clearing free for all that saw several players being thrown out of the game and getting suspended. <b>It</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> Game 2 in the battle for third place between South Korea and Toyota. The Sokors won Game 1 and Toyota needed to beat the visitors to force Game 3. In an ensuing play, leading Rookie of the Year candidate Antero Saldana kicked South Korean forward Li Min Hyun in the body. As a consequence, Saldana was disqualified from the ROY race. The award went to another Saldana (no relation to Antero), San Miguel point guard Marte Saldana. San Miguel won the title, beating Crispa in Game 3. This was the only conference in 1982 where they failed to win, thereby losing their hopes of a similar grand slam victory won by Crispa in 1976 and followed up in 1983.|$|E
