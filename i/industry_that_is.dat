A total of 671,475 Gremlins were sold in the United States and Canada, making it the most popular single generation body style/chassis produced by AMC (other models, such as the Rambler and even Hornet, have higher production numbers, but consisted of more than one chassis design and body style in the case of the Rambler, multiple body styles for the Hornet).|$|E
25|$|The {{primary action}} of buffer stocks, {{creating}} price stability, is often {{combined with other}} mechanisms to meet other goals such as the promotion of domestic <b>industry.</b> <b>That</b> <b>is</b> achieved by setting a minimum price for a certain product above the equilibrium price, {{the point at which}} the supply and demand curves cross, which guarantees a minimum price to producers, encouraging them to produce more and thus creating a surplus ready to be used as a buffer stock. The price stability itself may also tempt firms into the market, further boosting supply.|$|E
25|$|The {{moratorium}} in 1992 {{marked the}} largest industrial closure in Canadian history. In Newfoundland alone, over 22,000 fishers and plant workers from over 400 coastal communities became unemployed. In response to dire warnings {{of social and}} economic consequences, the federal government intervened, initially providing income assistance through the Northern Cod Adjustment and Recovery Program, and later through the Atlantic Groundfish Strategy, which included money specifically for the retraining of those workers displaced by the closing of the fishery. Newfoundland has since experienced a dramatic environmental, industrial, economic, and social restructuring, including considerable outmigration, but also increased economic diversification, an increased emphasis on education, and the emergence of a thriving invertebrates fishing industry (as the predatory groundfish population declined, snow crab and northern shrimp proliferated, providing the basis for a new <b>industry</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> roughly equivalent in economic value as the cod fishery it replaced). Newfoundland's experience with the cod fishery is certainly an interesting one: the dramatic collapse of a natural resource that sustained and defined a people for over 500 years offers lessons to communities everywhere that have within their jurisdiction the maintenance of an ecosystem and its resources and illustrates clearly the importance of taking seriously the health and vitality of the Earth's natural systems.|$|E

[...] Jason Anderson of CBC News compares the etymology of neo soul to that of [...] "new wave" [...] and comments: [...] "As imperfect as the term may be, neo-soul is still an effective tag to describe the mix of chic modernity and time-honoured tradition that distinguished the genre's best examples.

40|$|Abstract in Undetermined The {{question}} of how new regional growth paths emerge has been raised by many leading economic geographers. From an evolutionary perspective, there are strong reasons to believe <b>that</b> regions <b>are</b> most likely to branch into <b>industries</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> technologically related to the preexisting industries in the regions. Using a new indicator of technological relatedness between manufacturing industries, we analyzed the economic evolution of 70 Swedish regions from 1969 to 2002 with detailed plant-level data. Our analyses show that the long-term evolution of the economic landscape in Sweden is subject to strong path dependencies. <b>Industries</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> technologically related to the preexisting industries in a region had a higher probability of entering that region than did <b>industries</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> technologically unrelated to the region's preexisting industries. These industries had a higher probability of exiting that region. Moreover, the industrial profiles of Swedish regions showed {{a high degree of}} technological cohesion. Despite substantial structural change, this cohesion was persistent over time. Our methodology also proved useful when we focused on the economic evolution of one particular region. Our analysis indicates that the Linkoping region increased its industrial cohesion over 30 years because of the entry of <b>industries</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> closely related to its regional portfolio and the exit of <b>industries</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> technologically peripheral. In summary, we found systematic evidence that {{the rise and fall of}} industries is strongly conditioned by industrial relatedness at the regional level...|$|R
500|$|The <b>industry</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> today {{described}} as private equity was conceived {{by a number}} of corporate financiers, most notably Jerome Kohlberg, Jr. and later his protégé, Henry Kravis. [...] Working for Bear Stearns at the time, Kohlberg and Kravis along with Kravis' cousin George Roberts began a series of what they {{described as}} [...] "bootstrap" [...] investments. [...] They targeted family-owned businesses, many of which had been founded in the years following World War II and by the 1960s and 1970s were facing succession issues. [...] Many of these companies lacked a viable or attractive exit for their founders as they were too small to be taken public and the founders were reluctant to sell out to competitors, making a sale to a financial buyer potentially attractive. [...] Their acquisition of Orkin Exterminating Company in 1964 is among the first significant leveraged buyout transactions. In the following years, the three Bear Stearns bankers would complete a series of buyouts including Stern Metals (1965), Incom (a division of Rockwood International, 1971), Cobblers Industries (1971) and Boren Clay (1973) as well as Thompson Wire, Eagle Motors and Barrows through their investment in Stern Metals. [...] Although they had a number of highly successful investments, the $27 million investment in Cobblers ended in bankruptcy.|$|E
500|$|Exceptions like Cimarron and Rio Rita aside, RKO's {{product was}} largely {{regarded}} as mediocre, so in October 1931, 29-year-old David O. Selznick visited Sarnoff in New York and {{convinced him to}} replace LeBaron as production chief. [...] As the new studio chief Selznick implemented rigorous cost-control measures, championed the unit production system, which gave the producers of individual movies much greater independence than they had under the prevailing central producer system. [...] "Under the factory system of production you rob the director of his individualism", said Selznick, [...] "and this being a creative <b>industry</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> harmful {{to the quality of}} the product made" [...] (even though Selznick earned a sour reputation for meddling in director output). Instituting unit production, he predicted, would also result in cost savings of 30–40 percent. To make films under the new system, Selznick recruited prize behind-the-camera personnel, such as director George Cukor and producer/director Merian C. Cooper, and gave producer Pandro S. Berman, aged twenty-six, increasingly important projects. Selznick discovered and signed a young actress who would become a star created by RKO, Katharine Hepburn. [...] Also enlisted was established star John Barrymore for a few memorable performances, when also used by Paramount used as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1920) or Warner Bros. used as Beau Brummel (1924). From September 1932 on, print advertising for the company's features displayed the revised name [...] "RKO Radio Pictures"; the Pathé name was used only for newsreels and documentaries. That same year, the New York City–based corporate headquarters moved into the new RKO Building, an Art Deco skyscraper rising high above RCA [...] controlled Radio City Music Hall that was one of the first Rockefeller Center structures to open.|$|E

Prior to the GE acquisition, NBC operated its radio division partly out of tradition, and partly to meet its then-FCC-mandated requirement to distribute programming for the public good (the broadcast airwaves are owned by the public; as that broadcast spectrum is limited and only so many broadcast stations existed, this served as the basis for government regulation requiring broadcasters to provide certain content that meets the needs of the public). Syndicators such as Westwood One were not subject to such rules as they did not own any stations.
