On 31 August 2015, the United Nations confirmed the temple was destroyed; the temple's exterior walls and entrance arch remain.|$|E

5|$|The task of {{incorporating}} eastern Honduras into the Spanish Empire {{fell to the}} evangelising efforts of Spanish missionary orders. The earliest Franciscan missionaries, {{at the beginning of}} the 17th century, attempted to convert the natives in their own settlements. It soon became obvious that this was impractical, given the paucity of available missionaries, and the wide dispersal of Indian villages and towns. The friars changed their tactics, and <b>gathered</b> <b>the</b> natives in mission towns, known as reducciones.|$|E
5|$|With two {{competing}} archbishops, both claiming the see and the Electorate, the contenders {{and their supporters}} <b>gathered</b> <b>the</b> troops. In numbers, Ernst had the advantage. The Pope hired 5,000 mercenaries from the Farnese family to support the new Elector. Ernst's brother, the Duke of Bavaria, provided an army and Ernst arranged for his brother Ferdinand's army to take possession of the so-called Oberstift, the southern territory of the Electorate; his troops plundered many of its villages and towns.|$|E
5|$|As Crash gathers the {{remaining}} crystals, he is attacked by several mutated animals dispatched by Brio, including the demented kangaroo Ripper Roo, the scimitar-wielding Komodo Brothers Moe and Joe, and the musclebound Tiny Tiger. During Crash's progression, Coco occasionally hacks into his holograph projector and warns Crash of her uncertainty of Cortex's true intentions. It is not until Crash has <b>gathered</b> <b>the</b> crystals that Coco {{is able to}} reveal Cortex's ultimate plan: with the energy harnessed from the planetary alignment, Cortex will power the gigantic Cortex Vortex built onto his space station and brainwash everyone on Earth into serving his army. Crash manages to defeat Cortex before the crystals can be used, but leaves the Cortex Vortex drifting aimlessly into space. Crash redeems himself by collecting the world's gems for Brio, who reveals that the gems can harness planetary energy as well and invites him to the completion of his laser device; Crash activates the laser and destroys the Cortex Vortex, breaking the space station apart.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} years of the decade, Nea Salamina was strong in home games but weak away. Noteworthy is the conquest of the amateur {{championship}} from farm team the period 1960–61, The games of the farm team <b>gathered</b> <b>the</b> same interest with the main team among fans, who enthusiastically celebrated winning the title. During this period the nucleus for a successful team was created, including Kyriakos Koureas (who later played for Olympiakos Piraeus). In December 1963, the league disbanded; at that time, Nea Salamina was in a tight three-way race with Omonia and APOEL. With the creation of Cypriot National Guard, many Nea Salamina's players joined the army; players would often come straight from camps throughout Cyprus to play league games with no training.|$|E
5|$|During the {{preliminary}} round at the World Championships, Sacramone {{qualified for the}} event finals on floor and vault {{and contributed to the}} top-qualifying position of the American team. She also posted a score on beam that would have been high enough to qualify her to the beam final. However, due to an International Federation of Gymnastics rule allowing only two athletes per country to participate in each event final, Sacramone was unable to compete for a beam medal, because teammates Liukin and Shawn Johnson qualified ahead of her. In the team final, she competed on vault, beam and floor, earning scores of 15.750, 15.600 and 15.325, respectively. When the American team faltered after a difficult beam rotation, in which two gymnasts made major errors, Sacramone <b>gathered</b> <b>the</b> team for a pep talk to refocus them for floor. The American team earned 184.400 points overall, which was good enough to secure the gold medal ahead of China and Romania.|$|E
5|$|Edward now {{seized the}} initiative, and moved northwards. Lancaster convened one final meeting at Doncaster in November, and also entered into an {{alliance}} with Robert I of Scotland to strengthen his hand against the King. In January 1322 Edward crossed the River Severn, and secured the surrender {{of several of the}} marcher lords while Lancaster remained passive. As the royal army crossed the River Trent after the Battle of Burton Bridge, Lancaster was forced to flee north. On 16 March Lancaster and his army had reached Boroughbridge by the River Ure where they were joined by the Earl's Secretary Sir Robert de Holland and the force he had raised in Lancashire. There they were cut off by the forces of Sir Andrew Harclay, a veteran from the Scottish wars, who had <b>gathered</b> <b>the</b> levies from the counties of Cumberland and Westmorland.|$|E

5|$|Four {{years after}} the Brood War, the Dominion is once again the {{dominant}} Terran power in the Koprulu sector. News reports reveal that {{in the four years}} {{since the end of the}} Brood Wars, the standing Dominion military forces have been reduced and defense budget has instead been diverted to hunting down rebel forces that operate against the Dominion. For reasons unknown, Kerrigan <b>gathered</b> <b>the</b> swarm at Char and then vanished from sight. With the Zerg gone, the Protoss have once again taken a passive role in the galaxy. Jim Raynor has formed a revolutionary group named Raynor's Raiders in order to overthrow Dominion Emperor Arcturus Mengsk. On Mar Sara, Raynor meets with an old comrade, Tychus Findlay. Together, they liberate the local population from Dominion control and also discover a component of a mysterious Xel'Naga artifact. As the Zerg begin to overrun Mar Sara, Raynor arranges an evacuation to his battlecruiser, the Hyperion, captained by Matt Horner, Raynor's second-in-command.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{performances}} can {{be classified}} as either formal ones or informal. During formal performances adherents follow a traditional set of rules that would govern playing and it usually involved people from outside the home. Informal performances are quite the opposite. The strict rules that normally govern play are often ignored and the performers are usually between people well acquainted with one another, usually close family members. These performances usually were times when amateurs practiced on the instruments, young boys and girls <b>gathered</b> <b>the</b> instruments, substituting the kulintang with the saronay and inubab. Ensembles didn’t necessary have to have five instruments like formal performances: they could be composed of only four instruments (three gandingan gongs, a kulintang, an agung, and a dabakan), three instruments (a kulintang, a dabakan, and either an agung or three gandingan gongs) or simply just one instrument (kulintang solo).|$|E

Guest <b>gathered</b> <b>the</b> right hand elements of 7 Platoon, hooking around Hodgkinson and counter-attacking the remaining Indonesians, killing the previously wounded soldier and one other. Yet another wounded Indonesian was observed to crawl away while the tenth proceeded to run off unharmed back in the direction from which the patrol had come. Within twenty minutes the contact was over and the Australians proceeded to collect the discarded Indonesian weapons and equipment, including a Browning Automatic Rifle, three MI rifles and 200 rounds of ammunition. Dressed in US steel helmets, green shirts and blue and khaki shorts, the Indonesian soldiers were subsequently identified as members of 440 Battalion.|$|E

5|$|In August 1805, the French Grande Armée {{invaded the}} German states {{in hopes of}} {{knocking}} Austria {{out of the war}} before Russian forces could intervene. On 25 September, after great secrecy and feverish marching, 200,000 French troops began to cross the Rhine on a front of 160 miles (260km). Mack had <b>gathered</b> <b>the</b> greater part of the Austrian army at the fortress of Ulm in Bavaria. Napoleon hoped to swing his forces northward and perform a wheeling movement that would find the French at the Austrian rear. The Ulm Maneuver was well executed, and on 20 October Mack and 23,000 Austrian troops surrendered at Ulm, bringing the total number of Austrian prisoners in the campaign to 60,000. The French captured Vienna in November and went on to inflict a decisive defeat on a Russo-Austrian army at Austerlitz in early December. Austerlitz led to the expulsion of Russian troops from Central Europe and the humiliation of Austria, which signed the Treaty of Pressburg on 26 December.|$|E
5|$|In December, Edward led {{his army}} across the River Severn and {{advanced}} into the Welsh Marches, where the opposition forces had <b>gathered.</b> <b>The</b> coalition of Marcher Lords crumbled and the Mortimers {{surrendered to the}} King, but Damory, Audley and the Earl of Hereford marched north in January to join Lancaster, who had laid siege the King's castle at Tickhill. Bolstered by fresh reinforcements from the Marcher Lords, Edward pursued them, meeting Lancaster's army on 10 March at Burton-on-Trent. Lancaster, outnumbered, retreated without a fight, fleeing north. Andrew Harclay cornered Lancaster at the Battle of Boroughbridge, and captured the Earl. Edward and Hugh the Younger met Lancaster at Pontefract, where, after a summary trial, the earl {{was found guilty of}} treason and beheaded.|$|E
5|$|Such {{a retreat}} {{was not an}} option in the face of another of Aberhart's troubles. One of Social Credit's 1935 {{promises}} had been the introduction of recall for MLAs, which they had implemented with their first legislative act. As Aberhart's popularity fell, the residents of his own Okotoks-High River riding, where he had been elected in a by-election shortly after the general election (in which he had not run), availed themselves of the legislation. On April9 their petition was endorsed by the riding's Social Credit constituency association, and by fall it had <b>gathered</b> <b>the</b> signatures of the required two thirds of the electorate. In response, the Social Crediters repealed the Recall Act retroactive to its date of origin; Aberhart claimed that oil companies active in his riding had intimidated their workers into signing the petition, and that some of the signatories had moved to the area specifically to sign.|$|E
