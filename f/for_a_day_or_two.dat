5|$|After {{the active}} {{portion of a}} seizure (the ictal state) there is {{typically}} a period of recovery during which there is confusion, {{referred to as the}} postictal period before a normal level of consciousness returns. It usually lasts 3 to 15 minutes but may last for hours. Other common symptoms include feeling tired, headache, difficulty speaking, and abnormal behavior. Psychosis after a seizure is relatively common, occurring in 6–10% of people. Often people do not remember what happened during this time. Localized weakness, known as Todd's paralysis, may also occur after a focal seizure. When it occurs it typically lasts for seconds to minutes but may rarely last <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b>|$|E
5|$|Often, all the mayflies in a {{population}} mature at once (a hatch), and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> in the spring or autumn, mayflies are everywhere, dancing around each other in large groups, or resting on every available surface. In many species the emergence is synchronised with dawn or dusk, and light intensity {{seems to be an}} important cue for emergence, but other factors may also be involved. Baetis intercalaris, for example, usually emerges just after sunset in July and August, but in one year, a large hatch was observed at midday in June. The soft-bodied subimagos are very attractive to predators. Synchronous emergence is probably an adaptive strategy that reduces the individual's risk of being eaten. The lifespan of an adult mayfly is very short, varying with the species. The primary function of the adult is reproduction; adults do not feed, and have only vestigial (unusable) mouthparts, while their digestive systems are filled with air. Dolania americana has the shortest lifespan of any mayfly: the adult females of the species live for less than five minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{cyclogenesis}} of Tropical Storm Emily was complicated, extending {{over several}} days from late July into early August. An easterly tropical wave—an equatorward trough of low pressure—exited the west African coast {{in the fourth}} week of July, at which point it became largely embedded within the monsoon trough. Located {{to the south of}} a ride of high pressure, the wave moved west-northwestward across the open Atlantic; it retained a broad circulation with little to no precipitation <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> Over time, clusters of convection increased around the broad system, and it developed two distinct centers of circulation on July30. During the morning of July 31, the large low markedly gained in organization, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted it was close to becoming a tropical depression. Later that day, however, the main circulation became increasingly elongated; its westernmost component soon detached to form a separate tropical wave. This new disturbance featured widely scattered convection and rainbands, which briefly affected the Lesser Antilles. The next day, a new area of deep convection with a dominant center formed as the circulation became better defined. It passed through the Leeward Islands with some improvement in its structure, and the surface winds rose to near tropical storm force. A reconnaissance flight into the system revealed the circulation center had become well defined near the deep convection. The system was upgraded to tropical storm status and given the name Emily at 0000UTC on August2, when it was located to the south of Dominica. During the initial stages of its existence, the storm accelerated toward the west-northwest in response to the strong high pressure to its north.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} many {{hypotheses}} that have attempted to explain why lemurs exhibit female social dominance while other primates with similar social structures do not, but no consensus has been reached after decades of research. The dominant view in the literature states that female dominance is an advantageous trait given {{the high costs of}} reproduction and the scarcity of resources available. Indeed, female dominance {{has been shown to be}} linked to increased maternal investment. However, when reproductive costs and extreme seasonality of resources were compared across primates, other primates demonstrated male dominance under conditions that were similar to or more challenging than those faced by lemurs. In 2008, a new hypothesis revised this model using simple game theory. It was argued that when two individuals were equally matched in fighting capacity, the one with the most need would win the conflict since it would have the most to lose. Consequently, the female, with higher resource needs for pregnancy, lactation, and maternal care, was more likely to win in resource conflicts with equally sized males. This, however, assumed monomorphism between sexes. The following year, a new hypothesis was proposed to explain monomorphism, stating that because most female lemurs are only sexually receptive <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> each year, males can utilize a more passive form of mate guarding: copulatory plugs, which block the female reproductive tract, preventing other males from successfully mating with her, and thus reducing the need for aggression and the evolutionary drive for sexual dimorphism.|$|E

500|$|Starfish are {{widespread}} in the oceans, but [...] are only occasionally used as food. There may be good reason for this: the bodies of numerous species are dominated by bony ossicles, and the body wall of many species contains saponins, which have an unpleasant taste, and others contain tetrodotoxins which are poisonous. Some species that prey on bivalve molluscs can transmit paralytic shellfish poisoning. Georg Eberhard Rumpf found few starfish being used for food in the Indonesian archipelago, other than as bait in fish traps, but {{on the island of}} [...] "Huamobel" [...] the people cut them up, squeeze out the [...] "black blood" [...] and cook them with sour tamarind leaves; after resting the pieces <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> they remove the outer skin and cook them in coconut milk.

500|$|On September 5, 1904, {{the bridge}} finally got its {{transfer}} to the bridge corporation, and a new toll-taker was hired for the new bridge. After this, life went back to normal in both communities. In October 1928, after the charter and opening [...] of the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, the bridge company was asked to sell the bridge to the commission for $60,000 (1928 USD), and on June 14, 1929, the commission abolished tolls along the bridge, making it free to cross at either end. With the bridge now {{under the control of}} the toll bridge commission, extensive repairs began on the 25-year-old structure. This construction included new beams for the bridge, new flooring, and an extensive repair to one bridge pier. Although the construction had only taken four months to complete, it still caused havoc in commuting across the structure. In 1940, the Pennsylvania approach to the bridge was designated as Pennsylvania Route 709, a designation that would last six years, being decommissioned in 1946. [...] The structure would face its most recent strength test in 1955, after the massive flooding from Hurricane Diane wreaked havoc in the area.

2500|$|Most {{types of}} {{reactors}} {{are sensitive to}} a process variously known as xenon poisoning, or the iodine pit. The common fission product Xenon-135 produced in the fission process acts as a neutron poison that absorbs neutrons and therefore tends to shut the reactor down. Xenon-135 accumulation can be controlled by keeping power levels high enough to destroy it by neutron absorption {{as fast as it}} is produced. Fission also produces iodine-135, which in turn decays (with a half-life of 6.57 hours) to new xenon-135. When the reactor is shut down, iodine-135 continues to decay to xenon-135, making restarting the reactor more difficult <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> as the xenon-135 decays into cesium-135, which is not nearly as poisonous as xenon-135, with a half-life of 9.2 hours. This temporary state is the [...] "iodine pit." [...] If the reactor has sufficient extra reactivity capacity, it can be restarted. As the extra xenon-135 is transmuted to xenon-136, which is much less a neutron poison, within a few hours the reactor experiences a [...] "xenon burnoff (power) transient". Control rods must be further inserted to replace the neutron absorption of the lost xenon-135. Failure to properly follow such a procedure was a key step in the Chernobyl disaster.|$|E
