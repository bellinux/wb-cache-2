5|$|TRIM is a SATA {{command that}} enables the {{operating}} system to tell an SSD which blocks of previously saved data are no longer needed {{as a result of}} file deletions or volume formatting. When an LBA is replaced by the OS, as with an overwrite of a file, the SSD knows that the original LBA can be marked as stale or invalid and it will not save those blocks during garbage collection. If the user or operating system erases a file (not just remove parts of it), the file will typically be marked for deletion, but the actual contents on the disk are never actually erased. Because of this, the SSD does not know that it can erase the LBAs previously occupied by the file, so the SSD will keep including such LBAs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>garbage</b> collection.|$|E
5|$|Luke, Obi-Wan, and the droids {{travel to}} Mos Eisley {{to find a}} pilot {{to take them to}} Alderaan. At a local cantina they hire {{smuggler}} Han Solo (Peter) and his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca (Brian), who agree to take them with their ship, the Millennium Falcon. The group is soon spotted by stormtroopers and they flee into space, evading the pursuing Star Destroyers before jumping into hyperspace. Leia is imprisoned on the Death Star, where commanding officer Grand Moff Tarkin (Adam West) has Alderaan destroyed. The Millennium Falcon exits hyperspace and is captured by the Death Star's tractor beam and brought into its hangar bay. Disguising themselves as stormtroopers, Han and Luke along with Chewbacca set off to rescue the captive Princess while Obi-Wan goes to shut off the tractor beam and R2 and C3PO stay behind. Han, Luke and Chewie rescue Leia, and the four dive into a garbage chute to escape stormtroopers and find a couch <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>garbage</b> masher below. As they flee the Death Star, Obi-Wan turns off the tractor beam before being confronted by Darth Vader in a lightsaber duel. Vader strikes Obi-Wan down as the others board the Falcon, taking the couch with them.|$|E

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{assess the}} use, {{handling}} {{and disposal of}} insulin injection equipment by diabetic patients in Pakistan. MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study at diabetic clinics in five tertiary centers in Pakistan. All diabetic patients (type 1 /type 2) who were on insulin for more than 1 month, were included. An Urdu (local language) -translated questionnaire was used to collect information on insulin administration equipment, the site and frequency of needle use, insulin syringe/pen/lancet disposal, sharing of needles and knowledge about diseases that are spread by sharing contaminated needles. ResultsOf 375 patients, 58 % were female. The mean (SD) duration of diabetes was 12. 3 (7. 3) years, and the duration of insulin use was 4. 4 (4. 3) years. The majority of the patients used syringes (88. 3 %) for insulin administration. Additionally, {{the majority of the}} patients disposed of used devices (syringes, 92 %; pens, 75 %; and lancets, 91 %) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> household <b>garbage</b> collection bin. About half of the patients (n= 185) reported being educated by their physicians about the disposal of sharps. Those who were educated by a physician (adjusted odds ratio (adjOR) : 0. 36; 95 %CI: 0. 16 – 0. 81) or could read/write English (adjOR: 0. 32; 95 %CI: 0. 11 – 0. 92) were less likely to dispose of syringes and needles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> household <b>garbage.</b> ConclusionThe common disposal of sharps <b>in</b> <b>the</b> household <b>garbage</b> has implications for disease transmission.
