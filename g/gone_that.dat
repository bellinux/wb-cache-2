After exploitation of the Kootenay basin by fur trappers, the beaver population was nearly exterminated as well.|$|E
25|$|Statistically, 2014 was Johnson's worst {{season to}} date. He started the season on an up-and-down note, but went winless {{through the first}} 11 races of the 2014 season (his best finish was 2nd at Martinsville). Skepticism began to arise, as he had never gone more than 12 races into a season without a win, and hadn't <b>gone</b> <b>that</b> long since {{the first few years}} of his Cup career. However, Johnson won the Coca-Cola 600, his first win in the race since 2005. Afterward, he went on to win at Dover the {{following}} week, making it the 13th time he had back-to-back wins.|$|E

The young couple are new to the big city and, based on Paul's con, invite him {{to live with them}} until he gets everything sorted out with his wealthy father—who Paul tells them is Flan Kittredge. The trio become good friends, with Paul spinning a tale of being estranged from his racist father; the girlfriend tells Rick not to lend Paul any money. One night Paul takes Rick out on the town, and seduces him {{in order to get the}} money. Later that night, Rick tells Elizabeth that Paul is <b>gone,</b> <b>that</b> he has all their money, and that he and Paul had sex.

25|$|It {{was during}} one of her singing {{promotions}} for Where Love Has <b>Gone</b> <b>that</b> Vega was discovered by Bong Carreon, who then offered {{her to be a}} recording artist for the then newly formed Emerald Recording Company owned by Carreon and his then wife, the famous Filipina singer Imelda Papin. Her debut single Somewhere In My Past, composed by Mon Del Rosario, was a major hit which became a certified gold record in only its first few weeks of release and would prove to be her most enduring hit and the one song she would be most identified with. The single’s success prompted Bong Carreon and Imelda Papin to launch Vega as a full-time solo artist by coming up with the latter’s 1985 debut album First Love, which included Somewhere In My Past and produced her further hit songs like Someone Special, The Memory Will Remain, and the title track itself.|$|E
500|$|The Moving Picture World {{synopsis}} states, [...] "State Senator Jack Dare, one of {{the reform}} members of the legislature, starts to the state capitol to attend an important session of that body. That he took the midnight train from his home city is clearly proven, for his aged mother was a passenger on it, and besides the conductor and porter are certain that he retired for the night. In the morning, however, his berth is empty, although some of his garments are found there. The case puzzles the railroad officials and the police, and Violet Gray is {{given a chance to}} distinguish herself. She learns from the conductor and porter, who had happened to spend the night awake at opposite ends of the car, that the senator did not go by them. Consequently this leaves only the window as his means of egress, and she knows that he must have <b>gone</b> <b>that</b> way. Violet discovers that Dare is a hearty supporter of a bill that a powerful lobby is trying to defeat. The fight is so close that his is the deciding vote. Dare cannot be bribed, so his opponents spirited him away in a novel fashion. But the girl finds where he is hidden and brings him back, although he is much injured. He reaches his seat in time to cast the needed vote, and to astound and defeat the lobby." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cézanne, {{progressively}} {{leading up}} to 1906, moved away from classic pictorial arrangements, single view perspectives, and outlines that enclosed color. His attempt was {{to arrive at a}} [...] "lived perspective" [...] by capturing all the complexities that could be observed with the eye and captured by the senses, where both [...] "sight" [...] and [...] "touch" [...] became one. Cèzanne believed his paintings could capture a moment in time, that once passed it was <b>gone,</b> <b>that</b> art and nature are the same. Cèzanne claimed: [...] "Art is a personal apperception, which I embody in sensations and which I ask the understanding to organize into a painting." [...] The true meaning of painting grew closer as the distance from tradition increased. Just as the Cubists he would inspire, Cèzanne had little interest in the rational naturalistic painting and classical geometrical perspective inherited from the Renaissance. [...] "Nor was he satisfied," [...] writes Merleau-Ponty, [...] "with the attempts of the Impressionists to dissolve this objective order into its original elements of light and atmosphere".|$|E
2500|$|In 1852, {{when his}} first major novels of Russian society were still to come, Turgenev wrote an {{obituary}} for Nikolai Gogol, intended for publication in the Saint Petersburg Gazette. The key passage reads: [...] "Gogol is dead!... What Russian heart is not shaken by those three words?... He is <b>gone,</b> <b>that</b> man whom {{we now have the}} right (the bitter right, given to us by death) to call great." [...] The censor of Saint Petersburg did not approve of this and banned publication, but the Moscow censor allowed it to be published in a newspaper in that city. The censor was dismissed; but Turgenev was held responsible for the incident, imprisoned for a month, and then exiled to his country estate for nearly two years. [...] It was during this time that Turgenev wrote his short story Mumu ("Муму") in 1854. [...] The story tells a tale of a deaf and dumb peasant who is forced to drown the only thing in the world which brings him happiness, his dog Mumu. [...] Like his A Sportsman's Sketches (Записки охотника), this work takes aim at the cruelties of a serf society. This work was later applauded by John Galsworthy who claimed, [...] "no more stirring protest against tyrannical cruelty was ever penned in terms of art." ...|$|E

I think there is so much richness in Toadie and Sonya going on that journey together which lends itself to humour, sadness, more drama. Cross fingers they will go down that path." [...] Morey also hoped Sonya could be happy in the future. Morey told the official UK Neighbours website in July 2011 that Sonya and Toadie would start to have some excitement and fun again following all the drama, but they would have to deal with a few issues first. When the subject of marriage comes up, Sonya and Toadie realise that they have different views about it. Morey explained, [...] "At this point Sonya wants to get married for the wrong reasons, and Toadie doesn't want to get married for the wrong reasons. They haven't both independently reached a healthy perspective on it. She wants to do it for security to protect Callum, and he doesn’t want to do it... He feels it will jinx , because his other marriages have <b>gone</b> <b>that</b> way." [...] Morey added that Sonya and Toadie have reached a point in their relationship where they have to make some big decisions, which could change the direction they move in.|$|E

2500|$|The {{difficulties}} with drink and drugs were shared with brother Nicky Booth, himself a former British and Commonwealth champion, {{who had spent}} time in prison for burglary and theft. Nicky had won both titles in 2000 after beating Tommy Waite at the Everton Park Sports Centre in Liverpool and having had only 12 previous professional fights. A bantamweight, Nicky Booth made four defences of his Commonwealth title before losing to Steve Molitor in 2002 and four defences of his British title, never losing it in the ring. Booth had also competed for the IBO and WBU bantamweight titles with his last fight on 20 September 2003 being a loss to Nathan Sting for the latter belt. Nicky Booth's addiction to drugs had led him, whilst British champion, to his arrest. Booth admitted carrying out a burglary and two thefts in November and December 2003 {{and was sentenced to}} two years in prison. Jason Booth reflecting in 2010 on the time when both brothers were having difficulties said [...] "It was bad for both of us...I managed {{to get back in the}} gym; the boxing saved me, it's that simple. Nicky is still trying." [...] Nicky began training with Jason in 2008 in an attempt to make a comeback and in the hope that the British Boxing Board of Control would issue him a license. Speaking at the time Nicky Booth said that his last appearance in the ring, the defeat to Nathan Sting, still hurt him saying [...] "I didn't want to fight him, I shouldn't have been in the ring that night...I wanted to pull out, but they said they would have to cancel the show if I did. I had no choice." [...] Booth said of the fight that he had only trained for three days and was coming off alcohol and drugs adding [...] "After round three I had nothing left. My legs had gone; everything had <b>gone.</b> <b>That</b> wasn't me fighting in there." [...] The comeback never happened and Jason, speaking prior to his fight with Jamie Arthur in 2011, told Sky Sports boxing magazine program 'Ringside' said that he wished Nicky would have been able to make a return to the ring saying that [...] "he tried and he's still trying now" [...] but that [...] "some demons are harder to shake off than others." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sackville-West and Trefusis eloped {{several times}} from 1918 on, mostly to France. While there Sackville-West {{dressed as a}} man when they went out together. The affair ended badly. The mothers of both women, Lady Sackville and Mrs. Keppel, joined forces to {{sabotage}} the relationship and force both women back to their husbands. Both women were deeply interested in Spain, especially the Spanish Romany, with Trefusis writing to Sackville-West that they should go to Spain to show [...] "you my pupil, I as your cicerone...I will show eyes of black velvet...the sevillana, the fandango, undulating bodies, throbbing castanets". In another letter, Trefusis wrote of her wish to live forever in Spain with Sackville-West, [...] "a world of sun and love, and singing, and dancing". Trefusis sought to appeal to Sackville-West's fascination with the Romany people by telling {{her that she was}} turning into a [...] "Gypsy", writing: [...] "They said, this evening after you <b>gone,</b> <b>that</b> you were like a dazzling Gypsy. A Gypsy potentate, a sovereign-what you will, but still a Gypsy". Trefusis and Sackville-West both used Romany phrases to express intensely held feelings such as man camelo tuti ("I can't live without you"), nonero jeli ("our love"), and sartute loude gayeres ("escape with you"). Both families were concerned that the women were creating scandal. In a letter to Nicolson dated 1 June 1919 explaining why she would not leave Trefusis, Sackville-West wrote: [...] "I never ought to marry you or anybody else; I ought just to have lived with you {{for as long as you}} wanted me...I ought never to have married until I was thirty. I really think that is the best solution for people like me. Women ought to have the freedom the same as men when they are young. It's a rotten and ridiculous system at present, it's simply cheating one of one's youth. It was all right for the Victorians. But this generation is disregarding, and next will have disregarded, the chrysalis." [...] At another point, Sackville-West wrote to Nicolson [...] "if wasn't for you, I would go off with V." [...] Trefusis continued to pursue Sackville-West to great lengths until Sackville-West's affairs with other women finally took their toll. In November 1919, while staying at Monte Carlo, Sackville-West wrote in her diary that she was [...] "down on" [...] herself with [...] "serious thoughts" [...] of suicide as she believed that Nicolson [...] "would be happier without" [...] her in the world. [...] The two women apparently made a bond to remain faithful to one another, meaning that although both were married, neither could engage in sexual relations with her own husband. Sackville-West, who already had two children by Nicholson, was prompted to end the affair when she heard allegations that Trefusis had been involved sexually with her own husband, indicating that she had broken their bond. When she decided to end the affair with Trefusis, Sackville-West again contemplated suicide, writing in her diary that she [...] "hated myself to the extent of thinking I better vanish" [...] from the world forever. Despite the rift, the two women were devoted to one another, and deeply in love. They continued to have occasional liaisons for a number of years afterwards, but never rekindled the affair.|$|E
