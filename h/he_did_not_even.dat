5|$|In January 1957, Diefenbaker {{took his}} place as Leader of the Official Opposition. In February, St. Laurent {{informed}} him that Parliament would be dissolved in April for an election on June 10. The Liberals submitted a budget in March; Diefenbaker attacked it for overly high taxes, failure to assist pensioners, {{and a lack of}} aid for the poorer provinces. Parliament was dissolved on April 12. St. Laurent was so confident of victory that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> bother to make recommendations to the Governor General to fill the 16 vacancies in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|In the novel, {{the protagonist}} {{and a female}} {{accomplice}} rent a home like the one Cox and Hauck rented in Atlanta. The character then opens accounts at several banks in the area {{so that he can}} use them for money laundering purposes, which Cox did. Then, Cox, like the character in the manuscript, forged a document, claiming that the mortgage on the home—which <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> own—was paid off. The character in the manuscript then contacted lenders, and told them he owned the property outright. Cox is in prison for this same crime.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Eccleston was {{the only}} one of the four lead actors who was already an {{established}} television face, having previously co-starred in the ITV crime drama series Cracker. Eccleston first heard about the project while working with Danny Boyle on the film Shallow Grave in the autumn of 1993. Initially, Eccleston had been considered by the production team as a candidate to play Geordie, but he was more interested in playing Nicky, who he saw as a more emotionally complex character. Eccleston was particularly concerned about being able to successfully perform with the Newcastle Geordie accent. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> attempt the accent at his audition, concentrating instead on characterisation. He drew inspiration for his performance as the older Nicky from Peter Flannery himself, basing aspects of his characterisation on Flannery's personality. He even wore some of the writer's own colourful shirts.|$|E

5|$|Rush {{was unique}} in early Australian {{sculling}} {{in that he}} provided opportunities for others to compete and excel, by organising regattas and other rowing events, though financially he gained little. He raised and raced horses, organised athletic carnivals, and was a generous supporter of charities, churches, and schools. His background {{as the son of}} Irish tenant farmers, a class traditionally debarred by law from owning land and hence accumulating wealth, gave Rush little understanding of the management of money. Rush and his wife had fourteen children, and the Rush family lived in grand, if not extravagant style; most Rush enterprises were financed by mortgages or promissory notes. When the Banks Crash of 1893 came, Rush was not only deeply in debt, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> own the house he lived in.|$|E
5|$|Jussi {{found himself}} in the unusual {{position}} of attempting to defend a client who refused to defend himself. With no evidence at his disposal to support Feletti's testimony, he was forced to rely almost entirely on his own oratory. Jussi put forward some aspects of the sequence of events that he said suggested that orders had indeed come from Rome—for example, that Feletti had sent Edgardo straight off to the capital without seeing him—and asserted that the Holy Office and the Pope were far better placed to adjudge the validity of the baptism than a secular court. He quoted at length from Angelo Padovani's account of his meeting with Anna Morisi in July 1858, then cast doubt on the grocer Lepori's claim that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> know how to baptise a child—Jussi produced a police report in which Lepori was described as a close friend of a Jesuit priest. Jussi proposed that Lepori and Bussolari might both be lying to protect themselves, and that Morisi's sexual impropriety did not necessarily mean her story was false. He concluded that since Feletti had been inquisitor at the time, he had merely done what that office required him to do, and no crime had been committed.|$|E
25|$|In {{a startling}} debut, Tauseef took 7 for 126, dismissing Kim Hughes twice and Greg Chappell once, sharing 18 wickets with Iqbal Qasim (the other two falling to Imran Khan).

5000|$|When the {{attraction}} towards external objects ceases, then there yet remains the internal craving {{which is called}} Trishna (thirst). The Jivanmukta is beyond Trishna. He is, <b>not</b> becoming. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> long for salvation. He is content.|$|R

25|$|Ironically, Milošević {{lost his}} grip on power by losing in {{elections}} he scheduled prematurely (that is, {{before the end of}} his mandate) and that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> need to win in order to retain power, which was centered in the parliaments that his party and its associates controlled.|$|E
25|$|When Haridasa Thakura {{was a young}} {{devotee of}} the Lord, he was allured by the {{incarnation}} of Maya-devi, but Haridasa easily passed the test because of his unalloyed devotion to Lord Krsna. He also believed to have stayed and chanted in a cave with a notorious snake, however, seemed unaffected by all of this. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> seem {{to be aware of}} the snake's presence.|$|E
25|$|The Carthaginian army {{returned}} to Panormus, and after leaving enough forces {{to defend the}} Carthaginian domain, Himilco sailed eastwards to Messene with 600 warships and transports. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> stop at Thermae to punish the city for rebellion but continued to Lipira, where he coaxed thirty talents of silver as tribute. All the Sicels except the Asserini had deserted the cause of Dionysius by this time, and Himilco made treaties with Thermae and Cephaledion to safeguard his supply route. From Lipara the Punic fleet sailed east and the Carthaginian army was disembarked at Cape Pelorum, 12 miles north of Messene.|$|E

'I don't {{know that}} it is worse than a belief which is no belief,' said the priest with energy;--'than a creed which sits so easily on a man that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> know what it contains, and never asks himself as he repeats it, whether it be to him {{credible}} or incredible.' ...|$|R
25|$|On 11 January 2006 Kušljić {{filed an}} appeal before the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina {{claiming}} that his fair trial rights were violated {{when it was}} not made {{possible for him to}} participate in the procedure before the Ministry of Civil Affairs and Communications of B and Ministry of Foreign Affairs of B, when it was decided that B would not request his extradition regarding the criminal procedure against him for genocide, although in his view B had jurisdiction, since <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> know the procedure was underway. The Court dismissed his appeal for being ratione materiae incompatible with the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E
25|$|Pratt's {{first-class}} career then tailed {{off in the}} 1963 and 1964 seasons: in 1963, he was {{a regular}} in the team {{until the end of}} June, but then reappeared in only the last two games; and in 1964, he made only eight first-class appearances. In both seasons, he played in Leicestershire's single matches in the Gillette Cup one-day competition. He scored 25 and took the first three wickets, albeit expensively, in the first-ever English List A match in 1963; Leicestershire were so comprehensively thumped in 1964 that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> get on to bowl. At the end of the 1964 season, he left the Leicestershire staff.|$|E
25|$|On 20 September 2017, {{the civil}} judge Andrés Fraga {{determined}} {{that in the}} company Fleg Trading Ltd, of the Bahamas, Mauricio Macri only accepted the position of director {{for which he was}} appointed to the sole and only effect of designating a replacement and resigning, and that in Kagemusha <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> accept tacitly the position of director for which he was appointed by Francisco Macri. The ruling adds that neither of the two companies he was a shareholder, that he did not receive any dividends or profits, did not participate in the business decisions or in any business, nor was he the owner or co-owner of any current bank account of the companies.|$|E
60|$|To {{return to}} the {{surrender}} of Faenza on April 26, 1501, we see Cesare on the morrow of that event, striking camp with such amazing suddenness that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> pause {{to provide for the}} government of the conquered tyranny, but appoints a vicar four days later to attend to it.|$|R
50|$|With his Resistance group {{destroyed}} {{and his father}} deported, Julien decides to go to southern France, perhaps to escape to fight elsewhere. He begs Charlotte to go with him. Charlotte refuses, saying that she still has duties to fulfill in France. Julien says that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> know Charlotte's real name. Charlotte simply smiles.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, Remedy {{revealed}} {{that it was}} developing a new intellectual property, Alan Wake, a game about a writer {{of the same name}} whose wife disappears during the couple's vacation in the Pacific Northwest. While searching for his wife, Alan realizes the events are coming to life from a thriller <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> remember writing.|$|R
25|$|Capone became {{increasingly}} security-minded and desirous of {{getting away from}} Chicago. As a precaution, he and his entourage would often show up suddenly at one of Chicago's train depots and buy up an entire Pullman sleeper car on a night train to Cleveland, Omaha, Kansas City, Little Rock, or Hot Springs, where they would spend a week in luxury hotel suites under assumed names. In 1928, Capone paid $40,000 to beer magnate August Busch for a 14-room retreat at 93 Palm Avenue on Palm Island, Florida in Biscayne Bay between Miami and Miami Beach. He never registered any property under his name. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> have a bank account, but always used Western Union for cash delivery, not more than $1,000.|$|E
25|$|In 1927, Bowles {{played only}} 11 games, and his batting fell away markedly: from 507 runs (his best) at 15.36 the {{previous}} year, his total {{was reduced to}} 175 runs at 10.29, with only three scores above 20. In 1928 he was once more a regular in the side, playing 24 games and sending down more than 300 overs, but was a major disappointment with the ball: his form in other departments of the game returned to some extent and he scored 473 runs and claimed 17 catches, but his bowling average ballooned to more than 80 as he took only 14 wickets all season. Indeed, after he had taken 3-85 against Northamptonshire, his last four first-class matches produced not a single wicket; in the last, against Hampshire, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> bowl.|$|E
25|$|Fr Paul Florensky {{was one of}} the Orthodox church's {{greatest}} 20th century theologians. At {{the same}} time he was also a professor of electrical engineering at the Moscow Pedagogical Institute, one of the top counsellors in the Soviet Central Office for the Electrification of the USSR, a musicologist and an art historian. In these fields he held official posts, gave lectures and published widely, while continuing to serve as a priest and <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> remove his cassock or pectoral cross while lecturing at the university. This situation caused him to be arrested many times beginning in 1925. He was loyal to Sergii. His last arrest occurred in 1933 and he was sent to a concentration camp in the far north. He was given a laboratory at the camp and assigned to do research for the Soviet armed forces during the war. He died there in 1943.|$|E
50|$|Rosimonda, {{though still}} in love with Faramondo, hides her {{feelings}} and tries to make Faramondo leave without her, and this so depresses Faramondo that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> bother to resist when Gustavo's soldiers take him. Rosimonda's intervention prevents his death, but sees him imprisoned; at least Adolfo is freed upon Rosimonda's and Clotilde's repeated pleading.|$|R
50|$|Parry's primary goal, however, {{is not in}} {{crafting}} a tightly-organized fiction, {{in the way a}} science-fiction writer might do; <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> {{attempt to}} provide a plausible explanation for the survival of Atlantis. Neither <b>does</b> <b>he</b> try to explain how his modern American protagonist can speak and read the same language as the Atlanteans. Parry's focus is on the polemical and satirical goals of his book.|$|R
50|$|Almost {{immediately}} the story changes track and introduces Sakthi’s girlfriend Rupa (Sunaina). The lovers soon part ways citing compatibility issues where Rupa complains that Shakthi {{is not the}} loving boyfriend she wanted. Sakthi's character is as such that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> remember <b>even</b> a single detail in their love life that Rupa deems important. Rupa tells Sakthi that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> {{seem to have the}} time for a girlfriend, and that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> care to <b>do</b> so. Rupa further aggravates the situation by asking Sakthi to close his eyes and tell her the colour of the dress she was wearing right then, but Sakthi finds that he could not. Grieved, Rupa leaves Sakthi, saying this was his character and that he would not change.|$|R
25|$|The events {{behind their}} betrothal began after John William was almost killed by cannon fire and roundshot on two {{different}} occasions. His mother, Henriette Amalia, perhaps realizing how vulnerable her son was, quickly began looking for a suitable bride to ensure an heir. In the end, the choice came down to two German princesses. She apparently informed him that he should think of the choice as between two chairs, {{and that he should}} choose the most comfortable of the two. John duly traveled to Hesse-Kassel and became engaged to the 20-year-old Marie Louise within a week. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> bother meeting the other candidate. The main factor in this decision was probably that Marie Louise's father was a trusted general under the well-respected Duke of Marlborough. In addition, marriage to a daughter of the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel would also have served to strengthen John William's place among the other ruling houses.|$|E
25|$|Zimbabwe had a {{good morning}} session on the third day, by their standards, as Laxman was run out for 140 and Yuvraj Singh and Dinesh Karthik were {{dismissed}} in successive overs. Captain Ganguly, however, held together well with the lower order, and he notched up the half-century along with his 5000th Test run before lunch, and India battled out the morning session with no further loss. And in the afternoon session, India's spinners took some beating. Dabengwa and Ewing bowled all but one over of the 37-over long session, despite Irfan Pathan defying the bowlers for 52 and Ganguly nurdling his way to 97 before tea, as Taibu seemed content with Ewing tying down the runs. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> do that very efficiently – by tea, his bowling analysis read 38–5–111–0, but he got a breakthrough three overs into the evening as the Indian captain smashed the ball straight to Dabengwa for 101. By the time, however, the Indian score had soared past 500, and in a frantic 40-ball feast at the end Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan and Anil Kumble combined to add 52 {{for the last two}} wickets.|$|E
25|$|Senna won {{the start}} and built up a small lead over Prost. Senna {{suffered}} an electrical problem when leading the race and his engine started to misfire. He signalled Prost through to a lead he would not lose on lap 34. Williams ended up being the only team to finish with both cars as the dirty track and unforgiving concrete walls ended six races, with the heat and dust cutting out many more. One driver, Alessandro Nannini, suffered from a severely sore neck after a crash in the morning warm-up and retired from fourth place on lap 10. Mansell and Berger suffered with the Ferrari V12s cutting out from identical alternator failures and both eventually retired. Patrese's second gave him third place in the championship, while Prost took the lead. Ecstatic Phoenix native Eddie Cheever celebrated his and his team's first podium of the season at his own home grand prix. The Brabhams, on the other hand, continued their lacklustre return, both drivers retiring with worn-out brakes. Dallara's Alex Caffi {{was the victim of}} a bizarre crash. Holding down 5th place, he was put into the wall on lap 52 by his own team mate Andrea de Cesaris when he was trying to lap him. The notorious de Cesaris later claimed <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> know Caffi was there trying to lap him.|$|E
