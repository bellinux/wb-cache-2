2500|$|The {{distribution}} of power density in the reactor is measured by ionization chambers located {{inside and outside the}} core. The physical power density distribution control system (PPDDCS) has sensors inside the core; the reactor control and protection system (RCPS) uses sensors in the core and in the lateral biological shield tank. The <b>external</b> <b>sensors</b> in the tank are located around the reactor middle plane, therefore do not indicate axial power distribution nor information about the power in {{the central part of the}} core. [...] There are over 100 radial and 12 axial power distribution monitors, employing self-powered detectors. Reactivity meters and removable startup chambers are used for monitoring of reactor startup. Total reactor power is recorded as the sum of the currents of the lateral ionization chambers. The moisture and temperature of the gas circulating in the channels is monitored by the pressure tube integrity monitoring system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{behavior}} selection mechanism and interactive learning method for a synthetic character. Synthetic character can decide its behavior by itself {{based on its}} own internal states (motivation, homeostasis, and emotion), and <b>external</b> <b>sensor</b> information. A behavior is selected by both probabilistic and deterministic methods. The probabilistic method uses the internal states and <b>external</b> <b>sensor</b> information, and the deterministic method which imitates animal’s instinct, uses only <b>external</b> <b>sensor</b> information. Both methods are complementary to each other. A user can teach the synthetic character a desired behavior by an interactive training method. To select a desired behavior among many behaviors, behaviors are grouped into analogous behavior sets. The learning algorithm includes the emotional parameters by which the training efficiency is affected. The performance of the synthetic character, Rity, developed with the proposed mechanism at RIT Lab., KAIST is demonstrated in a 3 D virtual world. I...|$|R

The robot is equipped with an <b>external</b> <b>sensor</b> (like laser range finder). Concerning the systematic error an augmented Kalman Filter is introduced. This filter estimates a vector state containing the robot configuration and the parameters characterizing the systematic component of the odometry error. It uses encoder readings as inputs and the readings from the <b>external</b> <b>sensor</b> as observations. The estimation of the non-systematic component is carried out through another Kalman Filter where the observations are obtained by two subsequent robot configurations provided by the previous augmented Kalman Filter.

40|$|The {{real time}} {{positioning}} system {{is necessary and}} essential for autonomous agricultural vehicles. In general, the <b>external</b> <b>sensor</b> used for positioning system equipped with vehicle has no practical use because of being unable to obtain the correct location information of a vehicle due to output error of a sensor. In this study, accuracy of the supersonic waves sensor which is used as the <b>external</b> <b>sensor,</b> was estimated, and further, the learning system of neural network (NN) was applied to decrease of output error of the sensor. As a result, error and fluctuation of sensor output became large according to revolutionary velocity of the sensor unit under the condition of measuring with sensor only. On the other hand, in case of revising a sensor output based on actual vehicles 2 ̆ 7 location by the NN learning system, sensor output was almost in agreement with actual location without the influence of revolutionary velocity of the sensor unit. Consequently, the learning system of NN is available for improving the accuracy of <b>external</b> <b>sensor</b> as a positioning system of the autonomous vehicles. 圃場機械を自律走行させるためには,車両位置のリアルタイムの認識が必要不可欠となる. 一般に位置認識に用いる外界センサはセンサの出力誤差により正確な位置情報が得られないため,現時点で使用するには実用的でない. そこで,本研究では外界センサの一つである超音波センサの出力誤差の確認を行い,ニューラルネットワーク(NN) の学習システムで出力誤差を軽減させることを試みた. その結果,センサのみでの位置情報ではセンサの回転速度の増加に伴い,誤差や変動が大きくなる傾向を示した. 一方, NNにより実際の位置情報を学習させ,センサ出力の補正を行った結果,回転速度の影響によらず正確な安定した位置情報が得られることが検証された. 以上より,自律走行車両に用いる外界センサの精度向上には, NNによる学習システムが有効であり,今後の実機への搭載・実用化に向けて寄与しうるものと考えられる...|$|R
