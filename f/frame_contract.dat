40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{introduces a}} framework enabling the dynamic verification of expressive specifications. Inspired by formal verification methods, this framework supports assertion, <b>framing,</b> and separation <b>contracts.</b> Assertion contracts specify what code should do, whereas <b>framing</b> <b>contracts</b> specify what code must not do. Separation contracts, inspired by separation logic, combine an explicit assertion contract with an implicit <b>framing</b> <b>contract.</b> In addition to supporting these expressive contracts, this framework also enables assertions to call existing code with side effects while ensuring that successful assertions do {{not affect the}} rest of the program. Contracts are guaranteed safe while remaining easy to write. This dissertation introduces a single interface, the delimited checkpoint, that supports all of the contracts listed above. Similar to previous work on equipping a programming language with first class stores, checkpoints represent a state in time. Computations can be run with memory restored to a checkpoint state. Checkpoints augment existing work with a novel family of difference operations that compare two checkpoints, revealing how the intervening computation interacted with memory. Additionally, checkpoints are delimited...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that loss <b>framed</b> <b>contracts</b> are an effective instrument for principals to maximize the effort of their agents. Framing effects arise from defining thresholds that vary the salience of losses and gains while preserving payoff equivalence of the underlying contract. While under Prospect Theory a loss frame should lead to more effort we show that contract thresholds also exert a suggestive effect on performance that can trump the impact of loss aversion. Loss framing therefore carries a risk. As agents focus their effort choice on the expressed thresholds, poorly selected thresholds reduce effort and the principal might prefer offeringacontractthatdoes not impose a threshold at all. On the other hand, imposing demanding thresholds may push effort beyond levels predicted by Prospect Theory...|$|R

In order to obtain the standard Gabor frame we construct a family of time localized wavelets <b>frames</b> that <b>contract</b> to that Gabor frame.

40|$|This paper {{consists}} of the Table of Contents and Introductory chapter of a new book, <b>Framing</b> <b>Contract</b> Law: An Economic Perspective. The central theme {{of the book is}} that an economic framework [...] incorporating such concepts as information asymmetry, moral hazard, and adaptation to changed circumstances [...] is appropriate for contract interpretation, analyzing contract disputes, and developing contract doctrine. The value of the approach is demonstrated through the close analysis of major contract cases. In many of the cases, had the court (and the litigators) understood the economic context, the analysis and results would have been very different. Topics and some representative cases include consideration (Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff Gordon), interpretation (Bloor v. Falstaff and Columbia Nitrogen v. Royster), remedies (Campbell v.

40|$|Web {{services}} have a potential to enhance B 2 B e-commerce {{over the internet}} by allowing companies and organisations to publish their business processes on service directories where potential trading partners can find them. This can give rise to new business paradigms based on ad-hoc trading relations as companies, particularly small to medium scale, can cheaply and flexibly enter into fruitful contracts, e. g., through subcontracting from big companies. More business process support by the web service infrastructure is however needed before such a paradigm change can materialise. The current infrastructure does not provide sufficient support for searching and matching business processes. We believe that such a service is needed and will enable companies and organisations to establish ad-hoc business relations without relying on manually negotiated <b>frame</b> <b>contracts</b> like RosettaNet PIPs.

5000|$|In an {{alternative}} reading, Karla F. C. Holloway's Legal Fictions (Duke University Press, 2014) suggests a different composition for the tradition and argues its contemporary vitality. Her thesis is that legally cognizable racial identities are sustained through constitutional or legislative act, and these nurture the [...] "legal fiction" [...] of African-American identity. Legal Fictions {{argues that the}} social imagination of race is expressly constituted in law and is expressively represented through the imaginative composition of literary fictions. As long as US law specifies a black body as [...] "discrete and insular," [...] it confers a cognizable legal status onto that body. US fictions use that legal identity to construct narratives — from neo-slave narratives to contemporary novels such as Walter Mosley's The Man in My Basement - that take constitutional fictions of race and their <b>frames</b> (<b>contracts,</b> property, and evidence) to compose the narratives that cohere the tradition.|$|R

50|$|The 13th century {{witnessed}} {{an increase}} in demand for religious panel painting, particularly altarpieces, although {{the reason for this}} is obscure, early 14th-century Tuscan painters and woodworkers created altarpieces which were more elaborate, multipanelled pieces with complex <b>framing.</b> <b>Contracts</b> of the time note that clients often had a woodwork shape in mind when commissioning an artist, and discussed the religious figures to be depicted with the artists. The content of the narrative scenes in predella panels however are rarely mentioned in the contracts and may have been left to the artists concerned. Florentine churches commissioned many Sienese artists to create altar pieces, such as Ugolino di Nerio, who was asked to paint a large scale work for the altar for the Basilica di Santa Croce, which may have been the earliest polyptych on a Florentine altar. The guilds, cognizant of the stimulus that external craftmanship brought, made it easy for artists from other areas to work in Florence. Sculptors had their own guild which held minor status, and by 1316 painters were members of the influential Arte dei Medici e Speziali. The guilds themselves became significant patrons of art and from the early 14th century various major guilds oversaw the upkeep and improvement of individual religious buildings; all the guilds were involved in the restoration of Orsanmichele.|$|R

40|$|I {{augment the}} study of {{repeated}} interfirm exchanges with social cognition to expand the understanding of trust development and learning, and how these combined forces shape subsequent contracts. Although scholars have extensively examined the independent effects of trust and learning on contracts in repeated exchanges, their co-evolution and combined impact have received much less attention. I argue this omission largely occurs because social cognition is not typically considered in these literatures, even though both trust development and learning are socio-cognitive processes influenced by each other, as well as heuristics (<b>contract</b> <b>frames)</b> and cognitive biases (intergroup attribution bias). When these processes are examined in a positive exchange, the <b>contract</b> <b>frame</b> (prevention or promotion) influences initial reputation-based trust or prior development of knowledge-based trust (competence or integrity), which biases what is learned. This biased learning further impacts knowledge-based trust development, and together these factors shape adjustments to subsequent contracts. In a negative exchange, the <b>contract</b> <b>frame,</b> prior reputation-based trust, and partner explanation (internal versus external) impacts what is learned from partner violations (competence or integrity). This biased learning influences knowledge-based trust development, and together they shape how subsequent contracts are adjusted. I also propose that biased learning influences when contracts act as complements or substitutes for different types of trust, addressing existing debates and critiques in these literatures. Finally, I discuss {{the dark side of}} integrity trust and trust repair under promotion contracts in repeated exchanges...|$|R

40|$|Contracts are {{the most}} {{informative}} records we have {{about the nature of}} commissioning prestigious works of art in the Renaissance. The Business of Art provides a framework for interpreting these important documents by surveying a body of contracts and related records concerning altarpieces and frescoes painted in Italy from the early fourteenth to the early sixteenth centuries. One of the distinctions of this important book lies in its quantifying of contractual information: it focuses attention away from individual commissions and emphasises the patterns and procedures that characterised the activity of commissioning and its development over time. Michelle O'Malley structures her inquiry around a trio of fundamental questions concerning the language that <b>framed</b> <b>contract</b> terms, the ramifications of contract stipulations for production and finance, and the means used to transmit information, particularly visual information, between a painter and his client. At the heart of the book is an analysis of the implications of the monetary decisions made by contracting parties. Set against a consideration of the background of the economic life of the period, the study widens the focus on commissions undertaken in Central Italy - which {{has been the subject of}} most of the research on contracts - to include in the analysis commissions from Venice and the Veneto, Lombardy, and Rome and the Papal States. It considers some of the most well-known works of the Renaissance, as well as little-studied and lost altarpieces and frescoes. In taking a fresh approach to the study of contracts and commissioning, The Business of Art demonstrates the fundamental quality of negotiation, involving the equal input of both parties, to the gestation of a new work of art. It underlines the contributions made by both parties, working together, to deciding such issues as the approach to the production of a work, the costs involved in its creation, and the details of its subject matter...|$|R
