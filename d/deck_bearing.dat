40|$|The {{performance}} of multi-span steel-concrete composite (SCC) bridges in recent seismic events {{has shown that}} these structures {{are very sensitive to}} earthquake loading. Extensive damage may occur not only in the substructures (piers), which are expected to yield, but also in the other components (e. g., <b>deck,</b> <b>bearings,</b> and abutments) involved in transferring the seismic loads. Current seismic codes allow the design of regular bridges by means of linear analysis based on response spectrum modified through a reduction factor reflecting their structural ductility capacity. In bridges with superstructure transverse motion restrained at the abutments, the sequential yielding of the piers can lead to a substantial change in the stiffness distribution. As a result, force distributions and displacement demand can significantly differ from the predictions provided by linear analysis. Bridges experiencing this drastic change in stiffness distribution are commonly referred to as “dual load path bridges”. The objectives of this study are to assess the influence of piers-deck stiffness ratio and of soil-structure interaction effects on the post-elastic seismic behavior of continuous SCC bridges and to evaluate the suitability of simplified linear elastic analysis in estimating the actual structural behavior of SCC bridges with regular geometry. Parametric analysis results are presented and discussed for a common bridge typology. The dependence of the response on the parameters is studied by nonlinear multirecord incremental dynamic analysis (IDA). The results are finally compared with those obtained by using linear multi-record IDA. Main focus is on curvature demand of the piers, bending moments along the deck and reaction forces at the piers and the abutments. The results presented in this study suggest that simplified linear elastic analysis based on inelastic response spectra can produce very inaccurate estimates of the actual structural behavior of SCC bridges with dual load path. 3 INTRO...|$|R

Nonlinear seismic responses of the bearings subjected to actual ground motions are examined in various directions.

40|$|International audienceInfrastructure {{systems such}} as road {{networks}} appear to be particularly exposed to multi-hazard events because of (i) their spatial extent, which may span various areas prone to different hazard types, and (ii) their interconnected nature, which facilitates the propagation of local losses across the whole system. Multi-risk assessment should consider interactions at both the hazard level (i. e. triggered events or independent events with a joint occurrence) and the vulnerability level (i. e. fragility models accounting for cumulated damage), thus requiring a harmonization effort on the various intensity measures, damage models or damage scales considered. Therefore this paper presents a method for the multi-risk assessment of infrastructure systems, which concentrates on the harmonization of losses from different hazard types. The global system is first decomposed into its physical elements (e. g. bridges), which are in turn broken down into structural components (e. g. piers, <b>decks,</b> <b>bearing,</b> etc.). Each component type has a different exposure and susceptibility to different hazard types, such as earthquakes, ground failures and floods. Therefore {{it is necessary to}} identify all the hazard-specific failure modes for each combination of hazard and component. The occurrence of each of these component failure modes can then be quantified through the derivation of hazard-specific component fragility curves, provided that the adequate modelling tools are available. In parallel, functionality losses, which are crucial metrics for the performance assessment of infrastructure systems, are estimated for each component failure mode through an expert-based survey. System failure modes can then be defined from combinations of component damage states to lead to consistent levels functionality losses (e. g. repair time, proportion of lane closure, etc.). Therefore, the consequences of various types of hazard-specific loading mechanisms can be harmonized in terms of functionality. The component fragility curves are assembled through Bayesian networks in order to update the joint probability of occurrence of the system failure modes: this results in fragility models that account for multiple hazard-specific intensity measures (i. e. vector-valued) and cumulated damage (i. e. use of component fragility curves for pre-damaged elements). Therefore such fragility functions have the potential to treat various multi-hazard configurations, such as independent or cascading events, while being directly associated to functionality losses. Based on fragility functions and the duration of repair operations given global damage states of bridges and tunnels, an ABM infrastructure natural hazard response simulation model is developed to simulate the interactions among the different infrastructures that constitute the road network system: roads, tunnels and bridges under a certain hazard scenario. Furthermore, the overall road network recovery time can also be estimated. Finally, the functionality losses that are potentially induced by multiple hazard events are aggregated and sampled (i. e. probabilistic scenarios), so that traffic modelling software may assess how the traffic flow changes as a consequence of road capacity reductions on the network. NEXTA, an open-source traffic equilibrium modelling software, is used to calculate additional journey time for travellers, based on a number of damage scenarios...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is the assessment and retrofit of an existing road bridge that is located in Cyprus over the river Kouris. In particular the study concerns in a road bridge with seven spans of 10. 5 m + 5 * 12. 6 m + 10. 5 m, a cross section width of 7. 10 m and a 5 m piers height that was constructed in the early 50 ’s. The structural system of the bridge comprises of cast in situ reinforced concrete T-beams and slab deck that is simply supported on masonry piers. According to the new urban plan to design the bridge should now accommodate two lanes per direction, a pedestrian walkway and a cycling lane with total cross section width of new deck 15. 60 m. The deck of the bridge widened using for aesthetic reasons the same cross section type and the new T-Beams and slab deck connected monolithically to the existing one. The existing part of the deck was strengthened with reinforced concrete jacketing due to inadequacy in shear resistance. Major challenge of the project posed the existing masonry pier layout that was insufficient to carry the new design seismic forces.

40|$|Time-history {{analysis}} {{is the most}} reliable method {{for the assessment of}} the behaviour of bridges subjected to seismic loads. It has been widely used in recent years on the evaluation of the seismic vulnerability of bridges. The selection of seismic motions {{is one of the most}} important issues for the time-history analysis. This thesis discusses four different methods for obtaining spectrum-compatible acceleration time histories (i. e., accelerograms) of seismic motions. Based on these methods, four sets of accelerograms compatible with the design spectrum for Montreal were selected for this study. These included (i) scaled real accelerograms, (ii) modified real accelerograms, (iii) simulated accelerograms, and (iv) artificial accelerograms. The selected sets were used as excitation motions in the nonlinear analysis of two existing bridges in Montreal. The bridges included a three-span continuous concrete slab bridge and a three-span continuous slab-girder type bridge. These two bridges are considered to be representative of typical highway bridges in Quebec. A number of response parameters, such as, the <b>deck</b> displacement, <b>bearing</b> displacement, column curvature ductility, and base shear were used for the evaluation of the effects of the selected sets on the response of the bridges. Based on the results from the analysis, simulated accelerograms are recommended for use in the time-history analysis of the bridges. Furthermore, a study was conducted on the investigation of the minimum number of accelerograms required for both linear and nonlinear time-history analyses. Two different scaling methods, i. e., partial area under the spectrum and the spectral acceleration at the fundamental period of the bridge, were used to obtain the bridge responses. It was found that 5 accelerograms are sufficient for the linear time-history analysis and 10 accelerograms are required for the nonlinear time-history analysis based on the results from the two bridges considered in this study...|$|R
40|$|Earthquakes {{are one of}} {{the main}} natural hazards that have caused devastations to bridges around the world. Given the {{observations}} from past earthquakes, substantial analytical and experimental research work related to bridges has been undertaken in Canada and other countries. The analytical research is focussed primarily on the prediction of the seismic performance of existing bridges. It includes bridge-specific investigations which are mainly conducted using deterministic approach, and investigations of bridge portfolios which are based on probabilistic approach. In both cases, nonlinear time-history analyses are extensively used. To conduct analysis on a given bridge, analytical (i. e., computational) model of the bridge is required. It is known that the seismic response predictions depend greatly on the accuracy of the input of the modeling parameters (or components) considered in the bridge model. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the effects of the uncertainties of a number of modeling parameters on the seismic response of typical highway bridges. The parameters considered include the superstructure mass, concrete compressive strength, yield strength of the reinforcing steel, yield displacement of the bearing, post-yield stiffness of the bearing, plastic hinge length, and damping. For the purpose of examination, two typical reinforced concrete highway bridges located in Montreal were selected. Three-dimensional (3 -D) nonlinear model the bridge was developed using SAP 2000. The effects of the uncertainty of each parameter mentioned above were investigated by conducting time-history analyses on the bridge model. In total, 15 records from the earthquakes around the world were used in the time-history analysis. The response of the <b>deck</b> displacement, <b>bearing</b> displacement, column displacement, column curvature ductility, and moment at the base of the column was considered to assess the effect of the uncertainty of the modeling parameter on the seismic response of the bridge.

40|$|Bridge {{management}} systems (BMS) have provided State and Metropolitan Planning Organizations with a systematic approach to bridge programming. While BMS are continually improving, those available fail {{to address the}} issue of element interaction. The fact that the deterioration of one bridge element may accelerate that of another is not acknowledged. Fault tree analysis, which is a graphical depiction of the various failure paths that lead to an undesirable outcome, offers a systematic method of organizing the element interactions that contribute to bridge deterioration. In addition to visually uncoupling the interaction of the bridge system components, the tree sets forth logical interrelationships that may be applied qualitatively to explain the system deterioration process and quantitatively to arrive at various probabilities of bridge deterioration. The integration of fault tree analysis into current BMS provides the missing link between component condition and structural system performance for structures cataloged in the bridge {{management systems}}. The fault tree analysis presented in this paper gives an approximate 95 % probability that an individual bridge comprised of elements in “poor ” condition will require rehabilitation if no maintenance action is taken.

40|$|The {{bridge bearing}} {{is one of}} the {{component}} members which provide resting supports between piers and <b>decks.</b> The bridge <b>bearing</b> is intended to control longitudinal movement caused by traffic flow and thermal expansion, thereby reducing stress concentration. In high seismicity area, the bridge bearing has been utilized as the base isolation system to mitigate acceleration transferred from the ground. Although the existing bridge bearing installed between superstructure and substructure provides extra flexibility {{to the base of the}} entire structure, considerable permanent deformation occurs due to lack of recentering capacity after earthquake. It is required to spend extra cost for repairing impaired parts. The bridge bearings integrated with superelastic shape memory alloy (SMA) devices used for upgrading the recentering effect into the friction damper are proposed in this study. The refined finite element (FE) analyses are introduced to reproduce the response of such new structures under cyclic loading condition. The bridge bearing systems that maintain uniform recentering capability are designed with various friction coefficients so as to examine energy dissipation and residual deformation through FE analyses. After observing FE analysis results, optimal design for the recentering bridge bearing system will be proposed to take advantage of energy dissipation and self-centering capacity...|$|R

The superstructure consists of three continuous segments with deck joints at piers # 3 and # 8. The structure was built in 1967, and underwent major strengthening and rehabilitation of the <b>deck,</b> girders, and <b>bearings</b> in 1985. Piers consist of a cast-in-place pier cap approximately 18 m long supported on two cast-in-place columns approximately 7 to 8 m tall supported on concrete pile caps over timber raft-pile foundations. Leaking omega-style strip seal deck joints at Pier # 3 and Pier # 8 have exposed the piers and girder ends to chloride contaminated run-off from the deck.

40|$|Earthquake ground motion can induce {{out-of-phase}} vibrations between adjacent structures due {{to differences}} in dynamic characteristics, which can result in impact or pounding of the structures if the at-rest separation is insufficient to accommodate the relative displacements. In bridges, seismic pounding between adjacent decks or between deck and abutment can result in localized <b>deck</b> damage, <b>bearing</b> failure, damage to shear keys and abutments, and even contribute to the collapse of bridge spans. This study investigates pounding in bridges from an analytical perspective. A simplified nonlinear model of a multiple-frame bridge is developed in MATLAB incorporating the effects of inelastic frame action, nonlinear hinge behavior and abutments. The equations of motion of the bridge response to longitudinal ground excitation are assembled and solved using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. Pounding is simulated using contact force-based models such as the linear spring, Kelvin and Hertz models, as well as the momentum-based stereomechanical method. In addition, a Hertz contact model with nonlinear damping (Hertzdamp model) is also introduced to model impact. The primary factors controlling the pounding response are identified as the frame period ratio, ground motion effective period ratio, restrainer stiffness ratio and frame ductility ratio. Pounding is most critical for highly out-of-phase frames. Impact models without energy dissipation overestimate the stiff system displacements by 15 %- 25 % for highly out-of-phase, elastic systems experiencing moderate to strong ground excitation. The Hertzdamp model is found to be the most effective in representing impact. Traditional column hysteresis models such as the elasto-plastic and bilinear models underestimate the stiff system amplification and overestimate the flexible system amplification due to impact, when compared with stiffness and strength degrading models. Strength degradation and pounding are critical on the stiff system response to near field ground motions, for highly out-of-phase systems. Current design procedures are adequate in capturing the nonlinear hinge response when the bridge columns are elastic, but require revisions such as the introduction of time dependent reduction factors, and a frame design period to work for inelastic situations. Finally, a bilinear truss element with a gap is proposed for implementing energy dissipating impact models in commercial structural software. Ph. D.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the context}} of {{infrastructure}} risk assessment, the application of fragility curves to elements such as bridges should mostly serve the purpose of quantifying the performance losses at the system level (e. g. disruption of traffic, additional travel times), since these losses usually outweigh the direct {{costs associated with the}} physical damage of infrastructure. To this end, a methodology is proposed for the derivation of probabilistic functionality curves for bridge systems: these curves directly provide the probability of exceedance of various loss metrics given the level of seismic intensity. The main steps of the proposed approach are the following:- Identification of the failure modes for the various components of the bridge system (e. g. piers, <b>bearings,</b> <b>deck,</b> abutments, etc.). - Derivation of specific component fragility curves for each component damage state. - Estimation of the functionality losses that are associated with each component failure mode, through an expert-based survey. - Construction of a Bayesian Network that describes the failure of the system, from the seismic intensity to the component damage states and the subsequent functionality losses. - Use of the Bayesian Network to generate the joint probability of occurrence of various levels of functionality losses given the seismic intensity. This approach is then applied to a generic multi-span simply-supported reinforced concrete bridge, for which component fragility curves are analytically derived through non-linear time-history analyses. The considered loss metrics are the repair duration, the proportion of closed lanes and the speed limit reduction, so that these parameters can be directly fed into traffic modelling tools for the computation of induced delays and the optimization of restoration strategies...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAn {{infrastructure}} is conventionally {{represented as a}} system of systems, where individual components are heavily interdependent. In this context, {{the assessment of the}} robustness or the resilience of an infrastructure requires to quantify a set of appropriate system performance indicators. The latter are usually accessed through the prediction of the functionality level of the components, and not only their physical damage states. Therefore the present study details a procedure for the derivation of probabilistic functionality loss curves, applied to the seismic fragility assessment of roadway bridges. The proposed approach may be decomposed into the following steps:-Identification of the bridge's structural components and corresponding damage mechanisms (e. g. yielding of pier columns, deformation of <b>bearings,</b> <b>deck</b> unseating, etc.);-Association of each component damage mode with a probabilistic distribution of functionality loss and repair duration, through an expert elicitation process;-Construction of a Bayesian Network (BN) in order to update the probabilistic distributions of losses at the bridge level, which result from the combinations of damage events at the component level [1]. The resulting curves directly express the probability of reaching or exceeding some predefined functionality levels given the seismic intensity at the bridge location. The use of BNs allows for the joint probability of functionality loss and repair duration to be accessed, which constitute crucial information for the design of restoration strategies. The derived functionality curves are then applied to a simplified road network, where thousands of probabilistic earthquake scenarios are generated in order to derive the distribution of the resilience index [2], with the inter-city travel time as the main performance indicator. Finally, various assumptions about restoration resources are also tested (e. g. possibility or not to perform repair operations at the same time), in order to check their effect on the restoration strategy...|$|R

40|$|Fibre Reinforced Polymer bridge decks, {{thanks to}} their {{beneficial}} properties and various advantages over traditional materials, have great potential as a material used in bridge engineering. They exercise high specific strength and stiffness-to-weight-ratio, a property particularly interesting {{from the point of}} view of designers, as it provides the possibility to consider new design concepts and what´s more significant, enables dead load savings, which is particularly important while retrofitting existing structures by replacing old bridge decks. Over the last 30 years, many authors have studied and conducted research for FRP composite bridge deck which are gaining greater acceptance as the materials of choices for civil and infrastructure applications. Nevertheless, many aspects still need to be addressed before a widespread introduction of this new technology is possible. The purpose of this research is to provide an overview and investigate the performance of FRP decking system used to upgrade old movable bridges when composite action is provided between the deck adhesively bonded with the main girders. This thesis will firstly introduce the literature research investigating the structural analysis of FRP decking systems. Afterwards, the efficiency of using FRP decks for upgrading old movable bridges is investigated through three-dimensional finite element models based on the use of commercial software Abaqus. Three different FRP decks, Ecosafe from Lightweight Structures BV, ASSET from Fiberline and Duraspan from Martin Marietta Composites are used to investigate the upgrading and deck replacement of the old movable bridge, Wilhelminabrug located in Zaandam, The Netherlands. Due to the deterioration of the steel superstructure, a preliminary investigation for each deck is computed using three different configuration of steel superstructure, alternating the main girder span and the availability of cross beams, during the static analysis in order to find the most suitable solution. The composite behaviour of the bridge and lateral load distribution are further examined for each of three decks using the strain distribution. Moreover, the fatigue life assessment is analyzed using the cumulative damage method for the FRP deck and the simplified ?-method for the steel superstructure. Lastly, the effect of temperature differences in vertical deflection is considered and a small parametric study is considered. Based on the results of this research, it can be concluded that FRP decking systems offer remarkable potential when low self-weight is a crucial demand of the project. The investigation suggests that the deflection (SLS) governs the design as opposed to strength (ULS), although with the right superstructure configuration the requirements can be met. Composite action and lateral load distribution are additional advantages that adhesively bonded FRP <b>decks</b> offer in <b>bearing</b> the external loadings.
