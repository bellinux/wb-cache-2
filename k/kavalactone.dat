40|$|Kava is a plant {{traditionally}} {{used for}} making beverages in Pacific Basin countries {{and has been}} used for the treatment of nervous disorders in the United States. The pharmacological activity of kava is achieved through <b>kavalactones</b> in kava extract, which include kawain, 7, 8 -dihydrokawain, yangonin, 5, 6 -dehydrokawain, methysticin, and 7, 8 -dihydromethysticin.

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{bioavailability}} of kavalactones in vitro {{and the possible}} differences in their bioavailability because of variations in either chemical structure or the method of extraction used. Research design and methods: Caco- 2 cell monolayers {{were used to determine}} the potential bioavailability of kavalactones. Kavalactones were added to the apical layer and basolateral samples were taken over 150 min to examine the concentration diffusing across the cell monolayer. <b>Kavalactone</b> concentrations in these samples were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography. Results: Kavalactones were found to be potentially bioavailable as they all readily crossed the Caco- 2 monolayers with apparent permeabilities (P-app) increasing from 42 x 10 (- 6) cm/s and most exhibiting more than 70 % crossing within 90 min. Not all differences in their bioavailability can be related to <b>kavalactone</b> structural differences as it appears that bioavailability may also be affected by co-extracted compounds. For example, the P-app for kawain from ethanol extracts was higher than the values obtained for the same compound from water extracts or for the <b>kavalactone</b> alone. Conclusions: While the extraction method used (ethanol or water) influences the total (but not the relative) concentrations of kavalactones, it does not markedly affect their bioavailability. Hence, any differences between an ethanolic or an aqueous extract in terms of the propensity of kava to cause liver damage is not because of differing <b>kavalactone</b> bioavailabilities...|$|E
40|$|Kava is a plant root extract that {{is widely}} {{consumed}} by Pacific Islanders. Kava contains {{a class of}} lactone compounds called kavalactones. The sedative and anxiolytic effects of kava are likely attributed to the efficacies of kavalactones on the nervous system. Although some studies have implicated the potencies of certain <b>kavalactone</b> species on γ-aminobutyric acid transmission, evidence supporting the action of kavalactones on the eukaryotic neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and acetylcholine (ACh) transmission is scant. Here, we used behavioral assays to demonstrate the effects of kavalactones at the Caenorhabditis elegans NMJ. Our results suggest that kavalactones disrupt the inhibitory-excitatory balance at the NMJ. Such perturbation of NMJ activity is likely due to excess or prolonged ACh transmission. In addition, we found that kavain, a major constituent of kava, induced worm paralysis but not convulsions. Hence, the modulatory action of kavain could be distinct from the other <b>kavalactone</b> species...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed at {{evaluating}} {{the potential of}} diethyl ether extracts UV/visible (UV/vis) absorbance for assessing the suitability of commercial lots of kava (Piper methysticum). The UV/vis absorption spectra of diethyl ether root extracts of 15 cultivars clustered them into three groups in parallel to their known genetic relatedness and their chemical composition determined by GC–MS and LC–MS analyses. Absorption peaks at 250 nm and 290 nm respectively corresponded to kavain, the most health-promoting <b>kavalactone,</b> and dihydromethysticin a non-desirable <b>kavalactone.</b> The absorbance peak at 340 – 350 nm reflected the yellow coloration of the extract, which was mainly due to the undesirable flavokavins, desmethoxyyangonin and yangonin. Ratios of absorbance values at 250 nm and 290 nm significantly differentiated all three groups of cultivars, namely 'noble' which provide health benefits from 'two-day' and 'wichmannii' that are health damaging.

Despite the long-standing therapeutic interest in kava, the molecular target(s) of the pharmacologically active constituents, kavalactones have not been established. γ-Aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAARs) {{are assumed to be}} the in vivo molecular target of kavalactones based on data from binding assays, but evidence in support of a direct interaction between kavalactones and GABAARs is scarce and equivocal. In this study, we characterised the functional properties of the major anxiolytic <b>kavalactone,</b> kavain at human recombinant α 1 β 2, β 2 γ 2 L, αxβ 2 γ 2 L (x = 1, 2, 3 and 5), α 1 βxγ 2 L (x = 1, 2 and 3) and α 4 β 2 δ GABAARs expressed in Xenopus oocytes using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. We found that kavain positively modulated all receptors regardless of the subunit composition, but the degree of enhancement was greater at α 4 β 2 δ than at α 1 β 2 γ 2 L GABAARs. The modulatory effect of kavain was unaffected by flumazenil, indicating that kavain did not enhance GABAARs via the classical benzodiazepine binding site.

40|$|Introduction: There is {{increasing}} {{evidence for the}} involvement of chronic inflammation and oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nuclear factor erythroid 2 -related factor 2 (Nrf 2) is an anti-inflammatory transcription factor that regulates the oxidative stress defense. Our previous experiments demonstrated that kavalactones protect neuronal cells against Amyloid β (Aβ) -induced oxidative stress in vitro by Nrf 2 pathway activation. Here, we tested an in vivo <b>kavalactone</b> treatment in a mouse model of AD. Methods: The <b>kavalactone</b> methysticin was administered {{once a week for}} a period of 6 months to 6 month old transgenic APP/Psen 1 mice by oral gavage. Nrf 2 pathway activation was measured by methysticin treatment of ARE-luciferase mice, by qPCR of Nrf 2 -target genes and immunohistochemical detection of Nrf 2. Aβ burden was analyzed by CongoRed staining, immunofluorescent detection and ELISA. Neuroinflammation was assessed by immunohistochemical stainings for microglia and astrocytes. Pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus was determined by Luminex multi-plex assays. The hippocampal oxidative damage was detected by oxyblot technique and immunohistochemical staining against DT 3 and 4 -HNE. The cognitive ability of mice was evaluated using Morris water maze. Results: Methysticin treatment activated the Nrf 2 pathway in the hippocampus and cortex of mice. The Aβ deposition in brains of methysticin-treated APP/Psen 1 mice was not altered compared to untreated mice. However, methysticin treatment significantly reduced microgliosis, astrogliosis and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL- 17 A. In addition, the oxidative damage of hippocampi from APP/Psen 1 mice was reduced by methysticin treatment. Most importantly, methysticin treatment significantly attenuated the long-term memory decline of APP/Psen 1 mice. Conclusion: In summary, these findings show that methysticin administration activates the Nrf 2 pathway and reduces neuroinflammation, hippocampal oxidative damage and memory loss in a mouse model of AD. Therefore, kavalactones might be suitable candidates to serve as lead compounds {{for the development of a}} new class of neuroprotective drugs...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Anxiolytic kava {{products}} {{have been associated}} with rare but severe hepatotoxicity in humans. This adverse potential has never been captured in animal models, and the responsible compound(s) remains to be determined. The lack of such knowledge greatly hinders the preparation of a safer kava product and limits its beneficial applications. In this study we evaluated the toxicity of kava as a single entity or in combination with acetaminophen (APAP) in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Kava alone revealed no adverse effects for long-term usage even at a dose of 500 mg/kg bodyweight. On the contrary a three-day kava pretreatment potentiated APAP-induced hepatotoxicity, resulted in an increase in serum ALT and AST, and increased severity of liver lesions. Chalcone-based flavokawains A (FKA) and B (FKB) in kava recapitulated its hepatotoxic synergism with APAP while dihydromethysticin (DHM, a representative <b>kavalactone</b> and a potential lung cancer chemopreventive agent) had no such effect.
