Gaga explained {{in an interview with}} the Daily Star that the lyrics carry a bit of an undertone of confusion about love and sex. According to the BBC, the [...] "Mum-mum-mum-mah" [...] hook used in the song is copied from Boney M's 1977 hit [...] "Ma Baker". [...] "Just Dance" [...] talks about being intoxicated in a party, with lyrics like [...] "What's <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor? / I love this record, baby but I can't see straight anymore".

500|$|The album {{includes}} one acoustic song, [...] "Hero of War", {{which is}} about an Iraq War Veteran looking back on his war experiences. It is described by Rolling Stone as an [...] "ambivalent aggro-folk track". McIlrath said of the song, [...] "I {{wanted to take the}} perspective [...] of 'What is the war going to be looked back on as?'" [...] In another interview McIlrath stated, [...] "It was a way to document what's going on, like other artists documented for their generation and for generations to come." [...] He went on to say, [...] "There are not many songs...talking about what's going on during eight years of occupation in Iraq. That, combined with meeting active soldiers and retired soldiers at our shows and hearing those stories about what is <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground amid all the bullshit, showed me the differences from what is really happening to {{what is happening in the}} news media. I just thought that this needed to go into a song." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{doctor is}} an {{ophthalmologist}} stricken blind after treating {{a patient with}} what will {{come to be called}} [...] "the white sickness". He is among the first to be quarantined along with his wife. Due to his medical expertise he has a certain authority among those quarantined. Much of this really comes from his wife not having gone blind; she is able to see what is <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ward and relay this to her husband. When the group from his ward finally escapes they end up travelling to and staying in the doctor and his wife's apartment. Several of the other main characters had been visiting the doctor's office when the epidemic begins to spread.|$|E
2500|$|Greg Vaughan, who had {{recently}} been let go from his role as Diego Guittierez on The Young and the Restless, was cast shortly thereafter and first appeared on February 20, 2003. Vaughan later described his screen test to Soap Opera Digest: [...] "I {{was a little bit}} intimidated. I knew about the character, the foundation of the story. I knew it was a difficult task that I was about to take on." [...] In July 2009, Vaughan denied rumors that he was being let go or put on recurring status. That September, ABC announced that Vaughan had decided to leave to explore other opportunities, and that Jackson would be reprising the role. However, Vaughan announced via Twitter that it was the network that decided to let him go. Jackson stated upon returning: [...] "It was a tough situation. I was not under any sort of headspace that someone was losing their job; it was that the role was opening up. (...) It was more of a confusing thing for me coming back and not knowing exactly what was <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other end of things." [...] Vaughan last aired on October 20, 2009, while Jackson first aired on October 27, 2009.|$|E

He began writing The Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon in 1987, and by 1988 was deep into the manuscript. [...] The writing process was a very difficult one for Spanbauer. [...] He had so little money that he lived like [...] "a subway rat, pale and frail, trying hard to believe in" [...] the novel he was writing. He later said, [...] "A lot of the stuff I came up with was pretty fearsome, facing some personal devils head-on. I couldn't distinguish between the world and the book. At one point, I was so stressed out, I passed out in Penn Station." [...] As he told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer after the book's publication, [...] "It's all a matter of trust. You're {{right in the middle of}} this story. [...] You don't know the end of it. It's this preposterous tale about these preposterous people, and you don't know what's going to happen next, and you're tired of eating chicken livers and fettuccine, and you're alone in this little square concrete apartment, there's no air or earth, and pretty soon it was hard for me to distinguish what was going on in my head and what was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outside."

Realising the {{futility}} of turning back to Wilson without help, they decided to rejoin Forbes anyway, and to that end traversed the swollen river with considerable difficulty. They then rode to where <b>the</b> battle <b>on</b> <b>the</b> southern side was still <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> <b>On</b> reaching <b>the</b> main column shaken and out of breath, Burnham leapt from his horse and ran to Forbes: [...] "I think I may {{say that we are}} the sole survivors of that party," [...] he quietly confided, before loading his rifle and joining the skirmish.|$|R
500|$|While {{attending}} {{university in}} 1996, Edwards made a short monster movie set in suburbia. He initially wanted to expand <b>on</b> that idea, {{but after the}} release of War of the Worlds, he believed it was [...] "not going to be special anymore". Considering that the film would have to be low-budget, Edwards decided to embrace the found footage style of The Blair Witch Project, and mix that element with his original concept.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the process of the formation of socio-cultural competence in foreign language teaching, and the possibility of using the discipline “Foreign Language” in achieving this goal. The importance of students’ socio-cultural competence formation is caused by modern Russian society inconsistencies: <b>on</b> <b>the</b> one hand globalisation processes are <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other inter-ethnic relations are getting worse, and conflicts are getting more violent. The characteristics of the components of socio-cultural competence are outlined in the paper and the stages of this competence formation (motivational, informative, activity) in teaching a foreign language in high school with the use of effective methods and technologies are described...|$|R

Also he looked particularly imposing {{in contrast to the}} youths and maidens and domesticated clergymen. There was a gravity, almost a solemnity, about his bronzed countenance and deliberate ordered conversation, which did not, however, favourably impress the aforesaid youths and maidens, if a judgment might be formed from such samples of conversational criticism as Mr. Quest heard <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> further side of his arbutus.|$|E
