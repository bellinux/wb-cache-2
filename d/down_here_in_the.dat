6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Dick agreed; [...] "thunderstorms {{here are}} frightful. Houses are often struck; but, lying <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open, {{there is not}} much fear." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah-huh! Sure--sure!" [...] {{interrupted}} Anderson, hastily. [...] "Now {{listen to}} me. Things ain't so {{bad as they}} look.... For instance, we're goin' to fool the I.W.W. <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> valley." ...|$|E

6000|$|Bittridge {{began to}} laugh. [...] "Then let's sit <b>down</b> <b>here,</b> or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ladies' parlor. It won't take me {{two minutes to}} make {{everything}} right. If you don't believe I'm in earnest I know you don't think I am, but I can assure you--Will you let me speak with you about Miss Ellen?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Put 'em <b>down</b> <b>here,</b> and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning drive these sheep away. That noise {{disturbs}} the dago, and I don't like it myself; {{they sound}} lonesome and helpless. That dog took 'em {{away for a}} while, but brought 'em back again; poor devil, he don't {{know what to think}} of it all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Where's the {{blooming}} ship? Can {{you tell}} me? blast my eyes! Under water--or what? It's coming <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> tons. Are <b>the</b> condemned cowls gone to Hades? Hey? Don't you know anything--you jolly sailor-man you [...] . ?" ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{this point}} {{one of the}} guides spoke up, saying: [...] "If the women would be more {{comfortable}} in a cabin, there's one <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brush by the lake. I found it this morning when I was wranglin' the horses." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want you}} to come back to town with me and put up with my people a bit. The mater is very keen about it; in fact, she says that she shall come <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> autumn if you don't come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{is said to}} be a right smart young lady," [...] said Mrs Keswick, [...] "well educated, and has {{travelled}} in Europe.

5000|$|The Song op. 15 No. 5 <b>Here</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{valley is}} a song <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lied tradition. Consequently, nature is not objectively portrayed {{as it is in}} Night music but nature mirrors the {{emotions}} of the subject. Nonetheless, it contains a night music characteristic: arpeggiated clusters of three adjacent notes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> medium and lower registers on the piano, played forte. The text is not particularly strong, but greater forces than artistic value (let alone reason) formed the inspiration: Bartók was madly <b>in</b> love with <b>the</b> poetess.INTERMEZZO <b>The</b> genesis of <b>Here</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Valley ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's no more lonesome {{than sitting}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark {{waiting for the}} tubs to come along, Harry, and it's far safer. There is not the {{slightest}} risk of an explosion now, for there are only our safety-lamps <b>down</b> <b>here,</b> while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> day the men will open their lamps to light their pipes; make what regulations the master may, the men will break them to get a smoke." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mary turned away, {{her face}} hard and harsh. [...] "Do what you want. We {{might just as}} well all go up and get killed at once, instead of dying slowly <b>down</b> <b>here,</b> like vermin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ground." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope you'll excuse me," [...] he said, rather awkwardly. [...] "You see, I've been <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{chaparral}} a year. I hadn't heard. Give me your checks, please, and I'll {{have your}} traps {{loaded into the}} wagon. José will follow with them. We travel ahead in the buckboard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it's terrible. Every summer I {{get scared}} to death and hide somewhere in the dark. Storms up on the sage are bad, but nothing to what they are <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> canyons. And in this little valley--why, echoes can rap back and forth so quick they'll split our ears." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No one knows. He {{was here}} before the ocean came, and he stayed here because he learned to like the water better than the land as a habitation. Perhaps King Anko is ten {{thousand}} years old, perhaps twenty thousand. We often lose track of the centuries <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sea." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Stay, my son; you {{are young}} and rash, and {{do not know the}} city. Lie <b>down</b> <b>here</b> and sleep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> anteroom. Three hours hence the sun rises, and we go forth against the enemies of the Lord.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You hadn't {{long been}} {{back from that}} Western experience. Well, your father has one decided consolation; you have {{fulfilled}} his hope that you would settle <b>down</b> <b>here</b> and practise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> State. And I hear that you are fast forging to the front. You are counsel for the Gaylord Company, I believe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Personally," [...] I said, [...] "I should {{prefer a}} country lad. I have come <b>down</b> <b>here</b> to be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country. With Hopkins around, I don't somehow {{feel it is}} the country. I might imagine it a garden city: that is as near as Hopkins {{would allow me to}} get. I should like myself {{something}} more suggestive of rural simplicity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Man," [...] said he, [...] "when {{you have}} reached the uttermost depths of degradation, little {{incidents}} which would vex a higher life, are to you of no consequence. Last night, my soul was among the gods; but I make no doubt that my bestial body was writhing <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garbage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{built from}} {{the designs of}} a man dead four years--who isn't here to correct us. We've made Icarus with our own hands, <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> labs.

6000|$|... "Mate," [...] he said, [...] "could you {{let us have}} a few {{buckets of}} water <b>down</b> <b>here?</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first place we are parched with thirst, {{and in the second}} we may as well try to get off some of the blood which, from a good many of us, has been let out pretty freely." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{things is}} well enough in their way,' {{observed}} Mr. Sikes: a little soothed as {{he glanced over}} the table; 'but {{what have you got}} to say for yourself, why you should leave me <b>here,</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mouth, health, blunt, and everything else; and take no more notice of me, all this mortal time, than if I was that <b>'ere</b> dog.--Drive him <b>down,</b> Charley!' ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I'm {{thankful that}} I can't say {{from my own}} {{experience}} what the feelings of a gentleman may be,' said Mark, 'but I should have thought, sir, as a gentleman would feel a deal more uncomfortable <b>down</b> <b>here</b> than up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fresh air, especially when the ladies and gentlemen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> after-cabin know just as much about him as he does about them, {{and are likely to}} trouble their heads about him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same proportion.

6000|$|Hawarden, May 24.—The house looks {{cleanliness}} itself, and [...] altogether being <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fresh air, {{and seeing}} nature all [...] round me so busy with her work so beneficent and beautiful, makes [...] me very sick of London and its wrathful politics, and wish that we [...] were all here, or hereabouts once more.|$|E
60|$|And {{because of}} this {{conviction}} I have determined to write down {{the story of the}} interesting periods of my life and of my death.

6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Edgar, with a {{confidential}} air; [...] "it's mine {{that has given}} out. I'd better explain that being stuffed with what somebody calls formulae gets monotonous, and it's a diet they're rather fond of at Oxford. <b>Down</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country they're almost as bad; and pretending to admire things I don't believe in positively hurts. That's why I sometimes protest, with, as a rule, disastrous results." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{the final}} game of the season, Lions’ radio play-by-play {{announcer}} Dan Miller summed up <b>the</b> whole year <b>in</b> a few sentences: Clock ticks <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> Green Bay. <b>The</b> Lions find themselves in a very familiar position. For 16 weeks, starting in Atlanta back in September, they took the field thinking this was gonna be their day. Sixteen times they were wrong, and now there are no Sundays left. By record, they are <b>the</b> worst team <b>in</b> league history. Zero and sixteen, those are the numbers that will forever be associated with the Detroit Lions.|$|R
5000|$|After campaigning with Morty and Helen {{getting the}} latest release of The Boca Breeze, Kramer reads {{the front page}} stating [...] "Candidate Cosmo Kramer Caught Barefoot at Clubhouse." [...] Upon hearing of this, Morty states that what Kramer did is against the rules. Kramer states that he couldn't find his shoes at the time. Jerry quotes [...] "These people work and wait their whole lives to move <b>down</b> <b>here,</b> sit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heat, pretend it's not hot, and enforce these rules." [...] Morty then states {{that this is a}} huge scandal and that they need damage control. Kramer {{suggests}} buying each of the 20 members of the condo board one of those Wizard [...] "tip calculators." [...] As Morty goes to take a nap, Jerry tells Kramer he can't get the deal he told his father that he'd received since there was no sale on them. Kramer says not to worry, Bob Sacamano's father lives in Florida and can help them out.|$|R
6000|$|... "And you are {{as white}} as a rag, too," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "and can hardly stand! Here is my shawl, sit <b>down</b> upon it <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corner, and I will beat your eggs. See, I have brought a fork, too; I {{should have been a}} good person to take care of Jacobites or Covenanters in old days! You shall have more to eat this evening; Ronald is to bring it you from town. We have money enough, {{although}} no food that we can call our own. Ah, if Ronald and I kept house you should not be lying in this shed! He admires you so much." ...|$|R
