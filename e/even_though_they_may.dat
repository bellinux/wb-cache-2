40|$|Abstract. Folk {{music is}} closely related to the musical culture of a {{specific}} nation or region. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> folk songs have been passed down mainly by oral tradition, most musicologists study the relation between folk songs on the basis of symbolic music descriptions, which are obtained by transcribing recorded tunes into a score-like representation. Due to the complexity of audio recordings, once having the transcriptions, the original recorded tunes are often no longer used in the actual folk song research <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> still <b>may</b> contain valuable information. In this paper, we present various techniques for making audio recordings more easily accessible for music researchers. In particular, we show how one can use synchronization techniques to automatically segment and annotate the recorded songs. The processed audio recordings can then be made accessible along with a symbolic transcript by means of suitable visualization, searching, and navigation interfaces to assist folk song researchers to conduct large scale investigations comprising the audio material...|$|R

25|$|While at {{the time}} {{computer}} implementation was not an issue, this method suffers from the difficulty sketched above to convert from Lehmer code to permutation efficiently. This can be remedied by using a different bijective correspondence: after using d'i to select an element among i remaining elements of the sequence (for decreasing values of i), rather than removing the element and compacting the sequence by shifting down further elements one place, one swaps the element with the final remaining element. Thus the elements remaining for selection form a consecutive range at each point in time, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> not occur {{in the same order}} {{as they did in the}} original sequence. The mapping from sequence of integers to permutations is somewhat complicated, but it can be seen to produce each permutation in exactly one way, by an immediate induction. When the selected element happens to be the final remaining element, the swap operation can be omitted. This does not occur sufficiently often to warrant testing for the condition, but the final element must be included among the candidates of the selection, to guarantee that all permutations can be generated.|$|E

The same can be said about Transcarpathia, although there the UOC(MP)'s main rival is the Greek Catholic Church and thus its share of total church buildings is only 40%. The capital Kiev is where the greatest Orthodox rivalry takes place, with the UOC(MP) holding about half of the Orthodox communities there. The only place where the UOC(MP) is a true minority, in both quantity, percentage and support are the former Galician provinces of Western Ukraine. There the total share of parishes does not exceed more than five percent. The UOC(MP) does not have any parishes abroad, as its followers identify themselves under the same umbrella as those of the Russian Orthodox Church.|$|E

30|$|Since Min {{females are}} {{generally}} less proficient than Min males in Taiwan (Huang and Fon 2007), {{it is tempting}} to overlay the effects of gender and proficiency and align males with high-level talkers and females with mid-level talkers. Although there indeed seemed to be some supporting evidence for such an alignment, {{as in the case of}} [R] and [L], patterns of other variants indicated that a simple alignment could not have been the whole story. For example, although high-level talkers were more likely to preserve [G] and avoid [D], there was no clear-cut gender effect for the two variants. Instead, an intertwined gender- and dialect-dependent pattern was found. Similarly, although males were more likely to preserve [Z] than females, the expected proficiency effect was only observed among Mix males, and not among other speaker groups. This suggests that the two factors of gender and proficiency should at least be partially independent of each other, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> sometimes <b>they</b> <b>may</b> indeed align. This could also be clearly observed in the consistency effect. Although high-level females were on a par with high-level males in terms of intra-syllabic consistency, their inter-syllabic consistency was much lower and patterned more with mid-level females, who showed both low intra- and inter-syllabic consistency. In other words, speaker gender and talker proficiency not only affect one’s variant choices, but also affect one’s consistency with regard to these choices.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} model of {{political}} budget cycles in which incumbents influence voters by targeting government spending to specific groups of voters {{at the expense of}} other voters or other expenditures. Each voter faces a signal extraction problem: being targeted with expenditure before the election may reflect opportunistic manipulation, but may also reflect a sincere preference of the incumbent for the types of spending that voter prefers. We show the existence of a political equilibrium in which rational voters support an incumbent who targets them with spending before the election <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> know it <b>may</b> be electorally motivated. In equilibrium voters in the more "swing" regions are targeted at the expense of types of spending not favored by these voters. This will be true even if they know they live in swing regions. However, the responsiveness of these voters to electoral manipulation depends on whether they face some degree of uncertainty about the electoral importance of the group they are in. Use of targeted spending also implies voters can be influenced without election-year deficits, consistent with recent findings for established democracies. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Headquarters {{managers}} of a medium-sized manufacturing company initiated a culture change {{in five of}} their dispersed wholesale units. The aim was for more external service quality. This paper aims to report {{the results of a}} test of three hypotheses, shedding light on the behavior of the involved agents. The hypotheses are rooted in the change management literature. Design/methodology/approach – The present study rests both on quantitative (survey) and qualitative (interviews) field data collected in two discrete phases over 3. 5 years and obtained from the operational employees. The authors use their quantitative survey data to examine agentic explanations for the failed change; their qualitative data corroborated the findings. Findings – No culture change or service improvement was detected. Despite the fact that local change agents were not the initiators or owners of the intended change, employee satisfaction with the local change agents (situated in the service units) was found to explain variance in the culture and climate scores. The results underscore, furthermore, the critical importance of training employees, or lack thereof, in instituting the required new behavior. Originality/value – Most change-management research collects data from the managers' point of view. There are relatively few studies like this one that have been conducted from the perspective of those employees working in frontline service units. Meeting the challenge to improve external and internal service through culture change is crucial in many firms, for their survival and growth; accomplishing such organisational change (in which both culture and climate are positively affected) does indeed require experienced change-management skills. Results of this study recommend the honing of the change-management skill “coaching” for experienced managers, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> themselves <b>may</b> not feel such a need. ...|$|R

Businessman) across countries confirming the Stereotype Content Model. H 2 : the match between initial male gender role attitudes and advertisement type would increase advertisement effectiveness only in countries with relatively low egalitarian norms (i. e., Poland and South Africa). A cross-national study was conducted through the use of student samples following a 3 (country: United Kingdom, Poland, and South Africa) x 2 (advertisement type) x (gender attitude) mixed design (N = 373). A three-way Multivariate Analysis of Variance showed support for H 1 and partial support for H 2 (i. e., the second hypothesis held on purchase intent and for South Africa). The study provides evidence for the cross-national applicability of the Stereotype Content Model to advertising and the limited predictive value of gender attitudes for purchase intent depending on country. Thus, contrary to mainstream advertising practices, breaking male gender stereotypes does appear to pay cross-nationally. Theoretical and practical implications alongside the potential for change in practices are discussed...|$|R
