The unit's first commanding officer was patriot leader and pastor Peter Muhlenberg, {{who became a}} militia colonel in 1775 {{at the request of}} Washington. In his last sermon from the pulpit, Muhlenberg read from Ecclesiastes 3:1, [...] "There is a time for all things, a time to preach and a time to pray; {{but there is also a}} time to fight, and that time has now come." [...] He removed his clerical robes to show that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> uniform as a militia colonel. He quickly enlisted 300 men from his congregation in the unit that became the 8th Virginia. Muhlenberg was appointed colonel on 1 March 1776. The 8th Virginia organized at Suffolk County Court House between 9 February and 4 April 1776. The unit's 10 companies came from Augusta, Berkeley, Culpeper, Dunmore, Fincastle, Frederick, and Hampshire Counties, plus the District of West Augusta. On 25 May 1776 the regiment officially became part of the Continental Army. Aside from Colonel Muhlenberg, the unit's field officers were Lieutenant Colonel Abraham Bowman and Major Peter Helphenstine.|$|E

6000|$|It was {{wonderful}} what a change {{the next few}} days made in dear old Bobbie. Have you ever seen that picture, [...] "The Soul's Awakening"? It represents a flapper of sorts gazing in a startled sort of way into the middle distance with a look in her eyes that seems to say, [...] "Surely that is George's step I hear on the mat! Can this be love?" [...] Well, Bobbie had a soul's awakening too. I don't suppose he had ever troubled to think in his life before--not really think. But now <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> brain to the bone. It was painful in a way, of course, to see a fellow human being so thoroughly in the soup, but I felt strongly that it was all for the best. I could see as plainly as possible that all these brainstorms were improving Bobbie out of knowledge. When it was all over he might possibly become a rotter again of a sort, but it would only be a pale reflection of the rotter he had been. It bore out the idea I had always had that what he needed was a real good jolt.|$|E
