5|$|The game's 15 {{missions}} {{take place}} in large levels that can be confronted in multiple ways. Guards may be knocked out with a blackjack or killed with a bow or sword, and their fallen bodies may be picked up and hidden. In addition to human enemies, the game features security automatons and surveillance cameras. While completing objectives such as frameups and blackmail, the player steals valuables {{that may be used}} to purchase thieving gear between missions. The player's main tools are specialized arrows, including water arrows to douse lights, moss arrows to <b>dampen</b> <b>the</b> player character's footsteps and rope arrows to reach higher ground.|$|E
5|$|The assault at Zeebrugge a {{few miles}} away from Ostend was more {{successful}} and the blocking of the major channel did cause some consternation amongst the German forces in Bruges. The larger raiders could no longer leave the port, but smaller ships, including most submarines, were still able to traverse via Ostend. In addition, within hours a narrow channel had also been carved through Zeebrugge too, although British intelligence did not realise this for several weeks. The defeat at Ostend did not entirely <b>dampen</b> <b>the</b> exuberant British media and public reaction to Zeebrugge, but in the Admiralty and particularly in the Allied Naval and Marine Forces the failure to completely neutralise Bruges rankled.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the tale}} of Maya Sita told in the Ramayana adaptations is absent from the original, the concept of Maya Sita first appears in the epic itself. In the battle between Rama and Ravana, Indrajit – the son of Ravana – creates an {{illusion}}ary Sita (Maya Sita) and kills {{her in front of}} Rama's monkey general Hanuman, as a war tactic to <b>dampen</b> <b>the</b> spirits of Rama's army. The fooled Hanuman reports it to Rama, who is also dejected by the news. However, they soon realise that it must be an illusion of Indrajit. Another surrogate Sita appears in a later interpolation of the epic. At the end of the Ramayana, a golden image of Sita is subsisted for the real Sita to be on side of Rama in sacrifices, after Sita's abandonment by Rama when her chastity is questioned by his subjects.|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the role that foreign aid can play in <b>dampening</b> <b>the</b> effect of climate change. This paper investigates the role of aid in {{mitigating}} the adverse effect of climatic shocks on food security in developing countries. Because foreign aid is an important source of revenue for developing countries, it can enable them to face climatic shocks by mobilizing or stabilizing resources for the financing of agriculture production or food imports. Our results show that foreign aid <b>dampens</b> <b>the</b> effect of climatic shocks on food security. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>dampening</b> effect is higher for countries that are vulnerable to food price shocks...|$|R

2500|$|In hand-to-hand <b>dampening,</b> <b>the</b> vibist plays a {{note with}} one mallet, while {{simultaneously}} pressing another mallet onto a previously ringing bar.

25|$|It is {{possible}} to identify the type of inhibitory effect a presynaptic neuron will have on a postsynaptic neuron, based on the proteins the presynaptic neuron expresses. Parvalbumin-expressing neurons typically <b>dampen</b> <b>the</b> output signal of the postsynaptic neuron in the visual cortex, whereas somatostatin-expressing neurons typically block dendritic inputs to the postsynaptic neuron.|$|E
25|$|After {{the engine}} and {{aircraft}} were in production there were several incidents where {{one or two of}} the high pressure turbine blades failed, forcing the aircraft to make emergency landings. An investigation revealed that the turbine section was suffering from a vibration resonance problem, leading to the turbine blade failures. The blades were strengthened and modified to <b>dampen</b> <b>the</b> vibrations. The engine, and the aircraft, returned to service in 1990.|$|E
25|$|Many {{formulae}} {{include an}} S-curve, where the price formula is different {{above and below}} a certain oil price, to <b>dampen</b> <b>the</b> impact of high oil prices on the buyer, and low oil prices on the seller. Most of the LNG trade is governed by long term contracts. When the spot LNG price are cheaper than long term oil price indexed contracts, the most profitable LNG end use is to power mobile engines for replacing costly gasoline and diesel consumption.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of {{heightened}} exposure and popularity of the philosophical schools (haereseis) of Greco-Roman society and education, Synods and Councils were forced to engage such schools that sought to co-opt the language and pretext of the Christian faith {{in order to gain}} power and popularity for their own political and cultural expansion. As a result, ecumenical councils were held to attempt to rebuild solidarity by using the strength of distant orthodox witnesses to <b>dampen</b> <b>the</b> intense local effects of particular philosophical schools within a given area.|$|E
25|$|It took {{well over}} a year to {{complete}} the painting. The first version of the portrait of Madame Gautreau, with the famously plunging neckline, white-powdered skin, and arrogantly cocked head, featured an intentionally suggestive off-the-shoulder dress strap, on her right side only, which made the overall effect more daring and sensual. Sargent repainted the strap to its expected over-the-shoulder position to try to <b>dampen</b> <b>the</b> furor, but the damage had been done. French commissions dried up and he told his friend Edmund Gosse in 1885 that he contemplated giving up painting for music or business.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, the {{experience}} of the intellectual classes following the Hundred Flowers Campaign silenced those aware of the folly of such a plan. According to his private doctor, Li Zhisui, Mao and his entourage visited traditional steel works in Manchuria in January 1959 where he found out that high quality steel could only be produced in large-scale factories using reliable fuel such as coal. However, he decided not to order a halt to the backyard steel furnaces so as not to <b>dampen</b> <b>the</b> revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. The program was only quietly abandoned much later in that year.|$|E
50|$|As of 1920, Zabid {{was one of}} {{two places}} in Arabia growing indigo. Zabid also grows and {{produces}} cotton. The British cite tribal disputes as <b>dampening</b> <b>the</b> economy in Zabid during the early 20th century.|$|R
50|$|World War I <b>dampened</b> <b>the</b> {{growth in}} yachting, but the 1920s once again brought a heyday of {{activity}} and advancement. The production manufacturing capacity and technology created {{during the war}} years catapulted the developments in yachting. However the crash of the international economy {{at the close of the}} decade as quickly <b>dampened</b> <b>the</b> demand for large exotic yachts. In order to survive designers and producers had to diversify their efforts and offerings. Once again small commercial craft became the test-beds for technology and the bread-and-butter for the builders in the 1930s. One of the great design teams from this period, Sparkman & Stephens is still influential today.|$|R
50|$|Further {{evidence}} that 5-HT <b>dampens</b> <b>the</b> reinforcing actions of dopaminergic medications {{comes from the}} co-administration of psychostimulants with SSRIs, and the phen/fen combination was also shown to have limited abuse potential relative to administration of phentermine only.|$|R
25|$|After a {{traumatic}} experience, {{a person may}} re-experience the trauma mentally and physically, hence trauma reminders, also called triggers, can be uncomfortable and even painful. It can damage people’s sense of safety, self, self-efficacy, {{as well as the}} ability to regulate emotions and navigate relationships. They may turn to psychoactive substances including alcohol to try to escape or <b>dampen</b> <b>the</b> feelings. These triggers cause flashbacks, which are dissociative experiences where the person feels as though the events is reoccurring. They can range from distracting to complete dissociation or loss of awareness of the current context. Re-experiencing symptoms are a sign that the body and mind are actively struggling to cope with the traumatic experience.|$|E
25|$|The 19th century saw an {{unprecedented}} era of prosperity for the Mosel wine industry {{under the rule}} of Prussia starting with the historic vintage of 1819. For the rest of the 1820s, there was a succession of outstanding weather and sterling wines produced. To promote the region's wine, the Prussian government lowered the tariffs for the import of Mosel wines to other regions of the Prussian kingdom. The development of the Zollverein customs union even further benefited the Mosel by reducing the customs on their wines traveling to other regions of the German Confederation. A string of bad weather vintages in the late 1830s and early 1840s would <b>dampen</b> <b>the</b> extent of prosperity that the Mosel would see.|$|E
25|$|To {{come up with}} a fast {{boat for}} IMS racing (or PHRF) Rob Ball aimed for maximum {{all-around}} speed relative to sailing length by providing a large rig, low center of gravity, narrow waterline beam, and weight concentrated amidships (to minimize pitching). Gentle handling characteristics result in a boat that is easy to sail, and make a boat sail faster in practice, so a big, stall-resistant keel and rudder were an important part of this design. The keel is large and deep, with an elliptical profile and narrow chord length where it joins the hull. There is a partial skeg -ahead of the big rudder to help <b>dampen</b> <b>the</b> quarter wave, improve tracking, and to fair in a more substantial rudder shaft.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} measure {{of the extent to which}} a {{financial}} sector is connected to the real economy. The Measure of Connectedness is the share of credit market instruments represented by claims whose direct counterpart belongs to the non-financial sectors. The aggregate U. S. Measure of Connectedness declines by about 27 % in the period 1952 - 2009. We suggest that this increase in disconnectedness between the financial sector and the real economy may have <b>dampened</b> <b>the</b> sensitivity of the real economy to monetary shocks. We present a stylized model that illustrates how interbank trading can reduce the sensitivity of lending to the entrepreneur’s net worth, thereby <b>dampening</b> <b>the</b> credit channel transmission of monetary policy. Finally, we interact our measure with both a SVAR and a FAVAR for the U. S. economy, and establish that the impulse responses to monetary policy shocks are <b>dampened</b> as <b>the</b> level of connection declines...|$|R
