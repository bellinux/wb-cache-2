5000|$|There {{are a few}} ways to {{help reduce}} the effects of acne. Use a gentle <b>exfoliating</b> <b>product,</b> such as a scrub that {{contains}} sea salt or jojoba beads instead of one that uses sharp seeds, granules, or husks. Some anti-acne creams contain drying agents such as benzoyl peroxide ( [...] in concentrations of 2.5 - 10% [...] ), which can help ease acne in certain cases — particularly among teenagers. However, many adults can't tolerate the intense drying effects and might experience cracked skin and red blemishes the longer they use the product. Users often choose to discontinue using the product if skin is experiencing extreme side effects imposed by the product.|$|E

50|$|One other {{technique}} involves exfoliating {{the skin}} {{before and after}} shaving, using various <b>exfoliating</b> <b>products,</b> included but not limited to, brushes, mitts, and luffas. This process removes dead skin cells, reducing the potential for ingrown hairs and allowing the razor to glide across the skin smoothly decreasing {{the risk of the}} razor snagging or grabbing causing razor burn.|$|R
30|$|Zhi et al. [49] {{presented}} exfoliation of bulk h-BN in dimethylformamide by sonication for 10  h {{with subsequent}} centrifugation to remove residual large-sized BN particles. Approximately 0.5 to 1  mg of h-BN nanosheets could be routinely obtained from 1  g of the bulk h-BN powder; this {{corresponds to a}} yield of exfoliation of approximately 1 %. The liquid exfoliation of layered materials [50, 51] provided similar yields. All the aforementioned cited exfoliation methods improve yields by countless repetition of exfoliation with the necessary intermediate operations (centrifugation) that isolate <b>exfoliated</b> <b>products</b> from the initial suspension. The resulting product is a diluted dispersion of the nanosheets in a suitable solvent.|$|R
40|$|Graphene was {{produced}} by electrochemical exfoliation of a used battery electrode. Aqueous solutions of cationic (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide), anionic (sodium dodecyl sulphate), and nonionic (poly vinyl pyrrolidone) surfactants, along with NaCl and combinations of these surfactants with NaCl, were used as the electrolyte. The following observations were made: (I) up to several micrometer sized graphene sheets were produced, (II) the addition of NaCl into the electrolytes significantly enhanced the yield of the exfoliated graphene, (III) the type of surfactant affected the defect density of the <b>exfoliated</b> <b>product,</b> and (IV) electrochemical impedance spectroscopy provided insight into {{the reason for the}} changes in the defect density ratio between the graphene samples...|$|R
40|$|Herein {{we propose}} a {{production}} scheme for conductive films composed of thin graphite sheets with high crystallinity and polymeric resin. The crystalline graphite sheets were successfully produced from natural graphite powder by solution-phase synthesis of {{graphite intercalation compounds}} (GICs), following a wet planetary-ball milling under mild conditions. The shear forces in the milling pot lead to a peeling of graphite flakes. Taking into consideration the interlayer bonding force, the delamination should be preferentially done from the expanded GICs interlayer rather than intrinsic graphite one. Some composite films derived from the phenolic resin and flaky graphite sheets displayed much higher electrical conductivities compared to the film from the feed graphite particles. We also demonstrate the stage structure of synthetic GICs affected the film conductivity. The composite films made from <b>exfoliated</b> <b>products</b> of ground (around stage IV) GICs exhibited high electrical conductivity {{with a small amount}} of he graphite sheets...|$|R
40|$|Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4) nanosheets were exfoliated from bulk g-C 3 N 4 and {{utilized}} {{to improve the}} sensing performance of a pure graphene sensor for the first time. The role of hydrochloric acid treatment on the exfoliation result was carefully examined. The <b>exfoliated</b> <b>products</b> were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The exfoliated g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets exhibited a uniform thickness of about 3 – 5 nm and a lateral size of about 1 – 2 µm. A g-C 3 N 4 /graphene nanocomposite was prepared via a self-assembly process and was demonstrated to be a promising sensing material for detecting nitrogen dioxide gas at room temperature. The nanocomposite sensor exhibited better recovery as well as two-times the response compared to pure graphene sensor. The detailed sensing mechanism was then proposed...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} with the main objective of assessing the suitability of Tanzanian vermiculites as soil improvers for crop production through characterization. The research involved five samples from Tanzania and one from South Africa, which was included for comparison purposes. The results show that not all samples are vermiculites, some are hydrobiotites. Analysis shows {{that none of them}} contain hazardous accessory minerals. The samples have high cation exchange capacities (CEC) and, thus, they are suitable as soil improvers with ability to retain plant nutrients form leaching. Some have elevated concentrations of Cr and Ni, but the metals are insignificantly plant-available and do not inhibit the uptake of essential plant nutrients. Heating vermiculites above 600 °C should be avoided as it reduces the CEC by more than 90 %, and makes some of the <b>exfoliated</b> <b>products</b> strongly alkaline and, thus, unfavourable for crop production. The Tanzanian vermiculites can retain plant-available water, but their ability is less than vermiculite from South Africa. The P in the vermiculites is extractable and extractability increases on heating to 200 - 400 °C. Application of vermiculites to the soil significantly enhanced the retention and fertilization of P. Nitrogen and K were less retained. Maize vegetative growth, dry matter yield, and nutrient uptake were significantly enhanced by amending the soil with vermiculites. Pre-heated vermiculite at 600 °C performed better than unheated vermiculite and inhibited the fixation of the applied K and N. Thus, the Tanzanian vermiculites are suitable for use as soil improvers for crop production. However, more field trials are recommended on other types of soils and crops other than sand and maize used in this research. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Asphalt is {{manufactured}} from {{crude oil}} and traditionally {{regarded as a}} colloidal system made up of asphaltenes micelles covered by a stabilizing phase of polar resins, which however, forms the interface with a continuous oily maltenic medium [1 - 3]. In spite of this traditional application, today only about 10 % of asphalt is used as roofing material, for thermal and acoustic insulation, humidity and corrosion protection components of paints and varnishes, etc., while the remaining 90 % is used for paving. Asphalt binder constitutes only a small but crucial part of any paving mix [4]. Physical properties and temperature susceptibility characteristics of the asphalt binder influence pavement performance at low and high field operating temperatures [5]. Recently, warm mix asphalt (WMA) has become popular where this technology allows reduction in fuel consumption and emissions in plants by addition of warm asphalt additive (WAA) [6 - 8]. During the ‘‘in life” service of asphalt binders, there are many types of failures, e. g. rutting, fatigue cracking and thermal cracking, which can reduce the quality and performance of pavements. Polymer modified asphalt (PMA) are blends of asphalt and one or more polymers, usually added in percentages ranging from 3 % to 7 % by weight, and were developed to overcome, or at least reduces, such problems. A various number of polymers {{have been used to}} produce PMA, but only a few are satisfactory from both the performance and the cost points of view [9]. Nowadays, researchers had put their interests on nanoclay which is a polymer that commonly used because it’s environmentally friendly and readily available. The proper selection of modified clay is essential to ensure effective penetration of the polymer into the interlayer spacing of the clay and so resulting in the desired <b>exfoliated</b> <b>product</b> [1, 5, 10 - 11]. Literature review has shown few studies investigating the effects of nanoclay upon binder incorporating WAA. Prior to investigating the properties of nanoclay modified binders containing WAA, the modified binders with the additives need to be studied in detail. The main objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the method of preparation and storage stability properties of nanoclay modified binders containing WAA...|$|R
30|$|The morphologies and {{structures}} of the <b>exfoliated</b> and fluorinated <b>products</b> were characterized by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi S- 4800, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an X-ray energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS), a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL, JEM- 2010 F, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), an atomic force microscope (AFM, NanoScope IV Veeco Instruments Inc., Plainview, NY, USA), and a D/max- 2550 PC powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku Co., Tokyo, Japan). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were conducted on an Axis Ultra DLD X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Kratos Co., Manchester, UK). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy investigations were performed on an IR Rrestige- 21 FTIR spectrometer (Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan).|$|R
40|$|Sodium {{fluoride}} (NaF) {{was used}} as an activation agent to successfully intercalate ferric chloride (FeCl 3) into hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). This reaction caused the hBN mass to increase by approx. 100 percent, the lattice parameter c to decrease from 6. 6585 to between 6. 6565 and 6. 6569, the x-ray diffraction (XRD) (002) peak to widen from 0. 01 deg to 0. 05 deg of the full width half maximum value, the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum's broad band (1277 /cm peak) to change shape, and new FTIR bands to emerge at 3700 to 2700 and 1600 /cm. This indicates hBN's structural and chemical properties are significantly changed. The intercalated product was hygroscopic and interacted with moisture in the air to cause further structural and chemical changes (from XRD and FTIR). During a 24 -h hold at room temperature in air with 100 percent relative humidity, the mass increased another 141 percent. The intercalated product, hydrated or not, can be heated to 750 C in air to cause exfoliation. Exfoliation becomes significant after two intercalation-air heating cycles, when 20 -nm nanosheets are commonly found. Structural and chemical changes indicated by XRD and FTIR data were nearly reversed after the product was placed in hydrochloric acid (HCl), resulting in purified, <b>exfoliated,</b> thin hBN <b>products...</b>|$|R
