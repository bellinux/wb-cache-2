25|$|Naegele's rule is a {{standard}} way of calculating the due date for a pregnancy when assuming a gestational age of 280 days at childbirth. The rule estimates the expected <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> (EDD) by adding a year, subtracting three months, and adding seven days to the origin of gestational age. Alternatively there are mobile apps, which essentially always give consistent estimations compared {{to each other and}} correct for leap year, while pregnancy wheels made of paper can differ from each other by 7 days and generally do not correct for leap year.|$|E

2500|$|On 26 September 1997, NSB {{announced}} that they would order 36 new trains from Ansaldo, with an option for an additional 40 units. Each train would cost 50million Norwegian krone (NOK), and NSB had 28 months to use their option. NSB's CEO, Osmund Ueland, stated that Ansaldo had been chosen because they had the best technical offer and had by far the lowest price. The new trains would have 35% lower maintenance costs and use 33% less electricity than the Class 69. The new trains would also have a higher maximum speed, have wider doors and make less noise. The electronics would be delivered by Ansaldo, the superstructure by Breda and the bogies by Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works (SLM). The estimated <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> for the trains was from 1 July 2000 to 1 July 2001. The exterior and interior design was made by Pininfarina, with assistance from NSB's own designers. The latter were used to tailor the design to the Norwegian public's preferences, which among other things involved use of wood in the interior. [...] At the time, Ansaldo also had an order for the Oslo Tramway's SL95.|$|E

Data were collected at a tertiary referral hospital from pregnant women at gestational ages 13 – 40 weeks referred for obstetric ultrasound {{as a part of}} routine antenatal care. A total of 1599 fetal sonographic biometric measurements were collected after screening for the inclusion criteria. For each measurement, separate regression models were derived to estimate the mean, standard deviation and reference percentiles at each week of gestational age for this cohort.
