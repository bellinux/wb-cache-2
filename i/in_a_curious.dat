5|$|Charlotte's Way, {{formerly}} known as Hill House, {{is located in a}} prominent setting close to Saint Paul's Church of Ireland church. This house was once the home of Charlotte Brontë's husband, Mr. Nicholls, who returned to Banagher after Charlotte's death. Nicholls remarried and lived at Hill House until his death in 1906. The house was sold to a Major Bell in 1919. He died in 1944 and his wife inherited the property. Florence Bell died in 1959. This connection to Brontë, one of the most renowned writers of the 19th century, is revealed in its present name, giving the house cultural interest. It is a detached three-bay two-storey house, built in 1753, with a gabled central bay to the façade with modern porch and single-bay two-storey wing to the south and two-bay two-storey wing to the north. It is now used as a bed and breakfast and visitors can enjoy its restored appearance and sense the history of a place connected <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>curious</b> way with the Brontë family.|$|E

25|$|Francis {{returned}} to South Africa and later {{appeared in a}} single match for Eastern Province against the MCC team of 1927–28. He captained the Eastern Province team and made 11 and 14 himself <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>curious</b> match in which the MCC side was all out for 49 in its first innings, and then, set 186 to win in a low-scoring game, hit off the runs without losing a wicket. This was Francis's last first-class match {{and the only one}} he played in his native South Africa.|$|E

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1898, as a young 14-year-old, Riefkohl was {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>curious</b> encounter with an American spy {{on the eve of}} the Spanish–American War. As recounted by the spy, Edwin Emerson, Jr. in Century magazine in September 1898, Emerson, who was pretending to be a German journalist, had been given Riefkohl's father's name by the German consul in St. Thomas. Upon his arrival in the town of Maunabo he met young Rudolph and asked the lad in German if he had a map of Puerto Rico (Emerson had lost his). Riefkohl answered that he did, but it was decidedly too big for Emerson's use. Riefkohl returned home, not knowing that Emerson was a spy, and quickly drew another map with a depiction of the major ports and harbors of Puerto Rico. It is believed that Emerson gave Riefkohl's map to another spy, Lieutenant Henry Howard Whitney, who posed as a British crew member in the furnace-room of the merchant ship, and that Whitney gave the map to General Nelson A. Miles, thereby influencing the general's decision as to the disembarkation points for the invasion of Puerto Rico. A Photostat copy of Riefkohl's map was published in the Century article. After the war Riefkohl moved to the United States and concluded his secondary education in Concord, Massachusetts, serving as a cadet in the Sixth Regiment of the Massachusetts Volunteers, the same regiment that saw service in the southern areas of Puerto Rico in 1898 during the Puerto Rico Campaign. In 1910, Riefkohl earned a degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT).|$|E
25|$|Sobers was at {{his best}} in England in 1966, scoring 722 runs and taking 20 wickets in the five Tests. Three times he topped 150, and the 163* at Lord's turned a certain defeat into a near victory. West Indies won 3–1. England toured the West Indies in 1967–68 for a series that became noted for England's {{deliberate}} slow play. West Indies were forced to follow on in the first Test but saved it without difficulty. The second Test was played on an underprepared wicket at Kingston. England won an important toss and scored 376. The bounce of the wicket having become very uneven, West Indies collapsed to 143 and followed on. On the fourth day in the second innings, a disputed decision led to a crowd riot, and the match had to be stopped for some time. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>curious</b> decision, the West Indian Cricket Board (WICB) agreed to add a 75-minute sixth day {{to compensate for the}} lost time. Sobers played an outstanding innings of 113 not out, which allowed West Indies to set England a target of 159 in 155 minutes. England just about saved the game, losing eight wickets for 68. In the fourth Test West Indies gained a first innings lead of 122 at Port-of-Spain, but with the second innings score at 92 for 2, Sobers, frustrated by England's slow over rates and wanting to give himself a chance, albeit a small one, to win, surprisingly declared the innings, a decision for which he was widely criticised at the time. England were set a target of 215 in 165 minutes and they achieved it with 3 minutes to spare. West Indies made one last effort to win the final Test, but England drew it with only wicket left in their second innings. West Indies lost the series 0–1, the first defeat since 1960–61.|$|E

[...] Marty continued to tour with Shenandoah {{until the end of}} the year, when the remaining members disbanded and he sold the naming rights. In 2000, he released a second solo album and charted his only solo country chart hit, the number 63 [...] "Cracker Jack Diamond."

500|$|The {{open-ended}} {{nature of}} the lyrics has led to many interpretations. Journalist Michael Campbell believed the lyrics send [...] "a message of hope" [...] and wish for a [...] "world that is not divided by class, wealth, race, or any other arbitrary criterion". With regard to the place Bono was referring to in the song, he said, [...] "I'm not sure, really, about that. I used {{to think it was}} Belfast..." [...] Journalist Niall Stokes believes the title was influenced by Bono's and his wife Ali's visit to Ethiopia as volunteer aid-workers. Bono has expressed mixed opinions about the open-ended lyrics: [...] "I can look at it now and recognize that [...] {{has one of the most}} banal couplets in the history of pop music. But it also contains some of the biggest ideas. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>curious</b> way, that seems to work. If you get any way heavy about these things, you don't communicate. But if you're flip or throwaway about it, then you do. That's one of the paradoxes I've come to terms with." ...|$|E
500|$|Neuromancer {{was written}} on a [...] "clockwork typewriter," [...] the very one you may recall glimpsing in Julie Deane's office in Chiba City. This machine, a Hermes 2000 manual portable, dates {{from somewhere in the}} 1930's. It's a very tough and elegant piece of work, from the factory of E. PAILLARD & Cie S.A. YVERDON (SUISSE). Cased, it weighs {{slightly}} less than the Macintosh SE/30 I now write on, and is finished <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>curious</b> green- and-black [...] "crackle" [...] paint-job, perhaps meant to suggest the covers of an accountant's ledger. Its keys are green as well, of celluloid, and the letters and symbols on them are canary yellow. (I once happened to brush the shift-key with the tip of a lit cigarette, dramatically confirming the extreme flammability of this early plastic.) In its day, the Hermes 2000 {{was one of the best}} portable writing-machines in the world, and one of the most expensive. This one belonged to my wife's step-grandfather, who had been a journalist of sorts and had used it to compose laudatory essays on the poetry of Robert Burns. I used it first to write undergraduate Eng. lit. papers, then my early attempts at short stories, then Neuromancer, all without so much as ever having touched an actual computer.|$|E

500|$|Clarke's {{style has}} {{frequently}} {{been described as}} a pastiche, particularly of nineteenth-century British writers such as Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, and George Meredith. Specifically, the novel's minor characters, including sycophants, rakes, and the Duke of Wellington, evoke Dickens' caricatures. Laura Miller, in her review for Salon, suggests that the novel is [...] "about a certain literary voice, the eminently civilized voice of early 19th century social comedy", exemplified by the works of Austen. The novel even uses obsolete spellings—chuse for choose and shewed for showed, for example—to convey this voice as well as the free indirect speech made famous by Austen. Clarke herself notes that Austen's influence is particularly strong in the [...] "domestic scenes, set in living rooms and drawing rooms where people mostly chat about magic" [...] where Dickens's is prominent [...] "any time there's more action or description". While many reviewers compare Clarke's style to that of Austen, Gregory Feeley argues in his review for The Weekly Standard that [...] "the points of resemblance are mostly superficial". He writes that [...] "Austen gets down to business briskly, while Clarke engages <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>curious</b> narrative strategy of continual deferral and delay." [...] For example, Clarke mentions Jonathan Strange on the first page of the novel, but only in a footnote. He reappears in other footnotes throughout the opening but does not appear as a character in the text proper until a quarter of the way through the novel.|$|E

Earlier, in preparing the shark, the crew had discovered that the shark's stomach held true papers for that brig Nancy that Sparrow had captured on 28 August 1799 and that Nancys captain had thrown overboard {{to hide the fact}} that she was American, not English.|$|E

The Cobalt Violet mozzetta, crimson in Velázquez's painting, may reflect Bacon's use of printed reproductions of the painting. Bacon {{said that although}} he admired [...] "the magnificent colour" [...] of the Velázquez, Velázquez [...] "wanted {{to make it as}} much like a Titian as possible but, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>curious</b> way he cooled Titian", that is, made Titian more accessible to contemporary audiences.|$|E

Three {{of the four}} noble hostages that had remained in Asilah (separately from Ferdinand in Fez) – João Gomes de Avelar, Pedro de Ataíde and Aires da Cunha – died of the plague at this time. (<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>curious</b> note, when the Moroccans asked Ferdinand how Christians dealt with the plague, Ferdinand replied that [...] "they removed themselves from places where people were dying of it", a reply which was reportedly received with derisive laughter.) [...] By September 1441, the disappointing news arrived of the breakdown of Granada's offer, and Ferdinand was once again clapped in leg irons.|$|E
2500|$|Buick {{had been}} the first GM {{division}} to bring a personal luxury car to market with its full-size 1963 Riviera, but was otherwise slow to react to the developing lower-priced mid-size personal luxury market, which Pontiac created with the 1969 Grand Prix and Chevrolet with the Monte Carlo the following year, 1970. At the same time, Oldsmobile added a formal notchback coupé to its intermediate line, the Cutlass Supreme, in 1970 and that model soon became Olds' best selling intermediate. Buick did not get its own personal luxury coupe until the GM intermediates were redesigned in 1973, the so-called [...] "Colonnade" [...] cars that eliminated hardtop models completely. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>curious</b> name swap, the Skylark name was dropped from Buick's intermediate line and instead the Century nameplate, last used in the 1950s, was revived for them.|$|E
2500|$|Shodhan was a {{left hand}} batsman and {{occasional}} medium pace bowler. He {{was the second}} Indian batsman, after Lala Amarnath, to score a hundred on Test debut. He was selected against Pakistan on {{the weight of the}} 89* that he scored for West Zone against the Pakistanis earlier in the tour. Named as 12th man for the 1952 Calcutta test, he took the field after Vijay Hazare was unable to play. At Calcutta <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>curious</b> Indian innings where every batsman reached double figures, Shodhan scored 110 at batting at No.8 [...] In an interview Shodhan later reminiscenced about his hundred: [...] "I was an attacking player myself. I relished the attacking field set by Pakistan. Even when the ninth wicket was lost, I managed to hit two consecutive boundaries to reach 100". He added 40 runs for the last wicket with Ghulam Ahmed.|$|E

2500|$|The Western Australian Cricket Association {{was officially}} {{established}} on 25 November 1885 under the Presidency of JCH James. In 1893, the WACA ground was officially opened, occupying {{a site of}} old swamp land {{to the east of}} the city. The association has a 999-year lease over the land (which expires in 2888). The long term of the lease means that, effectively, the association has freehold title (save that it cannot divest itself of any part of the land without the state government's consent). [...] Originally, the title covered 29 acres (117,000m²), and took in what is now Gloucester Park. However, {{the latter part of the}} land was divested to the Trotting Association in the early 1920s. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>curious</b> twist, between 1977 and 1979, (then-rebel) World Series Cricket matches were played at Gloucester Park because the Kerry Packer-led organisation was not granted access to the WACA.|$|E
2500|$|Vedel quit La Carolina at 5:00a.m. July 18 {{and rushed}} the bone-weary French right wing {{south-west}} toward Bailén, unwittingly {{bearing down on}} Reding's rear. Both armies were now north of the Guadalquivir and staggered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>curious</b> position: Dupont between Castaños and Reding; Reding between Dupont and Vedel. At Guarromán, scarcely two leagues from Bailén, Vedel rested his footsore troops for a few hours—"he could not refuse this", says General Foy, [...] "after three days and three nights of incessant marching"—while patrols raced west to Linares to secure his rear. Aware neither that Dupont was preparing to move in his direction, nor that Vedel was now in fact drawing in behind him, Reding, posting a few battalions to hold Bailén from whatever French formations might remain in the east, set off with his two divisions westwards July 18, intending to surround Andújar from the rear and smash Dupont against Castaños.|$|E
2500|$|Rognvald {{thereafter}} {{returned to}} Norway, giving the northern isles {{to his brother}} Sigurd Eysteinsson. Sigurd had been the forecastleman on Harald's ship and after sailing back east the king [...] "gave Sigurd the title of earl". However, [...] the Heimskringla states specifically that Sigurd was the first Earl of Orkney. According to the Orkneyinga Saga, after Sigurd became earl he died <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>curious</b> fashion, following a battle with Máel Brigte of Moray. Sigurd's son Gurthorm ruled for a single winter after this and died childless. Rognvald's son Hallad then inherited the title. However, unable to constrain Danish raids on Orkney, he gave up the earldom and returned to Norway, which [...] "everyone thought was a huge joke." [...] Still, there is a tradition among the folk at Strath Halladale, Sutherland, which is named for Hallad, that he returned and was slain in battle {{at the beginning of}} the tenth century and was buried near the battle site in a circular trench ten or twelve feet wide. His sword, it is said, was placed beside him in the grave, and a stone was erected in the middle of the circle, part of which was still visible {{at the beginning of the}} eighteenth century. The site was near a little town called Dal Halladha, Halladha’s field.|$|E
