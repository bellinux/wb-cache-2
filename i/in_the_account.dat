The hidden costs of the self-management of business <b>accounting</b> services observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> department of <b>the</b> company have been assessed and {{the causes of the}}ir generating sources were identified and analyzed. The debate of these hidden costs involved the treating of notions that exist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> language, but are still not sufficiently explored by <b>the</b> specialists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. We also presented and analyzed the causes of the hidden costs of self-management <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> activity, as well as a reporting document for failures, arising from the case study.

Philip, escaping to his ships in the river, made his way over the mountains and back to Macedonia, having burned his fleet and left behind many thousands of his men that had died or been taken prisoner, along with all of his armies' possessions. Laevinus and his fleet wintered at Oricum.|$|E
5|$|It {{was in this}} palace that Alboin {{was killed}} on June 28, 572. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>account</b> given by Paul the Deacon, the most {{detailed}} narrative on Alboin's death, history and saga intermingle almost inextricably. Much earlier and shorter is the story told by Marius of Aventicum in his Chronica, written about a decade after Alboin's murder. According to his version the king {{was killed in a}} conspiracy by a man close to him, called Hilmegis (Paul's Helmechis), with the connivance of the queen. Helmichis then married the widow, but the two were forced to escape to Byzantine Ravenna, taking with them the royal treasure and part of the army, which hints at the cooperation of Byzantium. Roger Collins describes Marius as an especially reliable source because of his early date and his having lived close to Lombard Italy.|$|E

These balls were inscribed with a description of a gift, either food, clothing, slaves, pack animals, horse, cattle, or gold or silver vessels. Anybody who caught one could hand over the ball to an official who would provide the named gift in return. This was not unusual: Suetonius mentions that Nero did the same, giving 1,000 birds daily, as well as food parcels, and vouchers for various extravagant gifts.|$|E

5|$|On {{the day of}} Germanicus' death {{his sister}} Livilla gave birth to twins by Drusus. The oldest was named Germanicus and died young. In 37, Germanicus' only {{remaining}} son Caligula became emperor and renamed September Germanicus {{in honor of his}} father. Many Romans, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>account</b> of Tacitus, considered Germanicus to be their equivalent to King Alexander the Great, and believed that he would have easily surpassed the achievements of Alexander had he become emperor. In book eight of his Natural History, Pliny connects Germanicus, Augustus, and Alexander as fellow equestrians: when Alexander's horse Bucephalus died he named a city Bucephalia in his honor. Less monumental, Augustus' horse received a funeral mound, which Germanicus wrote a poem about.|$|E
5|$|Once in Ravenna, Helmichis and Rosamund rapidly became estranged. According to Paul, Longinus persuaded Rosamund {{to get rid}} of {{her husband}} so that he could marry her. To {{accomplish}} this, she made him drink a cup full of poison; before dying, however, Helmichis understood what his wife had done and forced her to drink the cup too, so they both died. According to Wolfram, there may be some historical truth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>account</b> of Longinus' proposal to Rosamund, as it was possible to achieve Lombard kingship by marrying the queen, but the story of the two lovers' end is not historical but legendary. The mutual murder as told by Agnellus is given a different interpretation by Joaquin Martinez Pizarro: he sees Helmichis' last action as a symbol of how the natural hierarchy of sexes is at last restored, after the queen's actions had unnaturally modified the proper equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|Spanish Hill is a hill {{located in}} the borough of South Waverly, Pennsylvania. The hill is {{controversial}} among historians and archaeologists; opinions regarding the origin of structures found on the site vary from embankments created by early farmers, to {{the remnants of a}} Native American village and battlements, due to the site's similarity to the description found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>account</b> of Étienne Brûlé of a settlement called Carantouan. The area in the hill's vicinity was previously occupied by Susquehannock Native Americans. It was a common site for both amateur and professional archaeology, as well as relic hunting. The source of the name remains unknown, but various theories have been proposed as to its origin.|$|E

5|$|The {{repulsion}} of the Arab {{assault on}} Nicaea {{was an important}} success for the Byzantines. Emperor Leo III the Isaurian (r. 717–741) regarded the city's survival {{as a sign of}} divine favour towards his newly instituted iconoclastic policies, and was encouraged to drive them further. This is probably related to an incident mentioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>account</b> of Theophanes, where a certain Constantine, who served as a groom (strator) to Artabasdos, threw a stone on an icon of the Virgin Mary and then trampled on it. The soldier was killed the next day by a catapult, a fact which Theophanes reports as evidence of divine vengeance. However, this passage shows strong signs of tampering by the fervently anti-iconoclast Theophanes, from what was probably originally a pro-iconoclast story.|$|E
