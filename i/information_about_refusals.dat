40|$|Abstract Background The Cohort Multiple Randomised Controlled Trial (cmRCT) is a newly {{proposed}} pragmatic trial design; recently several cmRCT {{have been}} initiated. This study tests the unresolved {{question of whether}} differential refusal in the intervention arm leads to bias or loss of statistical power and {{how to deal with}} this. Methods We conduct simulations evaluating a hypothetical cluster cmRCT in patients at risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). To deal with refusal, we compare the analysis methods intention to treat (ITT), per protocol (PP) and two instrumental variable (IV) methods: two stage predictor substitution (2 SPS) and two stage residual inclusion (2 SRI) with respect to their bias and power. We vary the correlation between treatment refusal probability and the probability of experiencing the outcome to create different scenarios. Results We found ITT to be biased in all scenarios, PP the most biased when correlation is strong and 2 SRI the least biased on average. Trials suffer a drop in power unless the refusal rate is factored into the power calculation. Conclusions The ITT effect in routine practice is likely to lie somewhere between the ITT and IV estimates from the trial which differ significantly depending on refusal rates. More research is needed on how refusal rates of experimental interventions correlate with refusal rates in routine practice to help answer the question of which analysis more relevant. We also recommend updating the required sample size during the trial as more <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the <b>refusal</b> rate is gained...|$|R

The Times repeated <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the brothers' hoarding and also repeated neighborhood rumors that the brothers lived in some sort of [...] "Orientalist splendor" [...] and were sitting on vast piles of cash, afraid to deposit it in a bank. Neither rumor was true; the brothers were certainly not insolvent, although eventually they would have been, since neither of them had worked for decades.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} general types of RMA, {{designated}} by scope. In the widest sense, the patient may even {{refuse to be}} evaluated by EMS. Generally, however, the patient will submit to an evaluation (consisting of vitals and an assessment) before asking or being asked <b>about</b> <b>refusal</b> by the EMS agency. Or a patient may refuse only specific actions, such as C-spine precautions.|$|R

40|$|We present two {{standards}} {{developed by}} the Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC) for reporting bacterial and archaeal genome sequences.

The standards are the Minimum <b>Information</b> <b>about</b> a Single Amplified Genome (MISAG) and the Minimum <b>Information</b> <b>about</b> a Metagenome-Assembled Genome (MIMAG), including, but not limited to, assembly quality, and estimates of genome completeness and contamination. These standards {{can be used in}} combination with other GSC checklists, including the Minimum <b>Information</b> <b>about</b> a Genome Sequence (MIGS), Minimum <b>Information</b> <b>about</b> a Metagenomic Sequence (MIMS), and Minimum <b>Information</b> <b>about</b> a Marker Gene Sequence (MIMARKS). Community-wide adoption of MISAG and MIMAG will facilitate more robust comparative genomic analyses of bacterial and archaeal diversity...|$|R

To distinguish one element from another, or our elements from someone else’s, we provide a potent description method, where 10 subsections are designed to describe the detailed properties for each element. ...|$|R
