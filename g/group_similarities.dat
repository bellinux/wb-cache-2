40|$|Abstract – This study {{tries to}} {{characterize}} national transportation modes to assess balancing and sustainability. Using a pioneer measure {{for sustainable development}} (SD), {{and based on the}} conformity of the growths of all sectors with transportation modes, the countries are comparatively studied. The proposed measure, elasticity, for each pair of variables indicates {{the extent to which the}} two variables have been changing consistently. Indeed the elasticity values are measures of “harmonic development ” reflecting sustainability. The study database consisted of key aspects of transportation sustainability in the form of national variables including transportation, economic, social and environmental categories in the period 1980 - 1995. Having developed the elasticity of the social, environmental and economic variables with respect to those of modal transportation, composite modal sustainability indices were suggested. The composite indices were then integrated into a unique SD index utilizing the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), and Concordance Analysis (CA) techniques. For comparative appraisal, country ranking and grouping based on DEA scores, as well as CA results were developed. The sustainability appraisal showed interesting patterns within and between <b>group</b> <b>similarities</b> and differences. The study confirmed the significance of modal transportation balancing and sustainability challenges of the 21 st century. The research focus is on its methodology.

40|$|The role of {{teaching}} experience has been acknowledged {{in the development of}} pedagogical expertise, however, past research has failed to specify the relationship between experience and expertise. The ill-defined nature of the teaching task has led researchers to inadequately define pedagogical expertise directly in terms of years {{of teaching}} experience. Moreover, the literature on pedagogical expertise is primarily based on data from school teachers, who typically are not subject matter experts in the topics they teach. This study attempted to establish the differences and similarities between experienced and inexperienced university professors in the planning and delivery of teaching {{and the extent to which}} these activities and processes resembled expert characteristics. Indices of teaching effectiveness were derived from both theoretical and empirical sources and applied to the practices of 11 university professors, ranging in experience from 1 to 30 years. After the conduction of a lecture, subjects were interviewed and asked to elaborate on planning decisions made prior to teaching and to trace the events of the class.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{cerebral}} resting {{state in}} schizophrenia is altered, {{as has been}} demonstrated separately by electroencephalography (EEG) and {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) resting state networks (RSNs). Previous simultaneous EEG/fMRI findings in healthy controls suggest that a consistent spatiotemporal coupling between neural oscillations (EEG frequency correlates) and RSN activity is necessary to organize cognitive processes optimally. We hypothesized that this coupling is disorganized in schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders, in particular regarding higher cognitive RSNs such as the default-mode (DMN) and left-working-memory network (LWMN). METHODS: Resting state was investigated in eleven patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (n =  11) and matched healthy controls (n =  11) using simultaneous EEG/fMRI. The temporal association of each RSN to topographic spectral changes in the EEG was assessed by creating Covariance Maps. Group differences within, and <b>group</b> <b>similarities</b> across frequencies were estimated for the Covariance Maps. RESULTS: The coupling of EEG frequency bands to the DMN and the LWMN respectively, displayed significant similarities that were shifted towards lower EEG frequencies in patients compared to healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: By combining EEG and fMRI, each measuring different properties of the same pathophysiology, an aberrant relationship between EEG frequencies and altered RSNs was observed in patients. RSNs of patients were related to lower EEG frequencies, indicating functional alterations of the spatiotemporal coupling. SIGNIFICANCE: The finding of a deviant and shifted coupling between RSNs and related EEG frequencies in patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder is significant, as it might indicate how failures in the processing of internal and external stimuli, as commonly seen during this symptomatology (i. e. thought disorders, hallucinations), arise...|$|E

Results Here we describe a publicly available tool, able to identify common structural motifs shared by different non homologous proteins in an unsupervised mode. The motifs can be as short as three residues and need not to be contiguous or even present in the same order in the sequence.

40|$|Abstract Background The type 1 (microbial) rhodopsins are {{a diverse}} group of photochemically {{reactive}} proteins that display a broad yet patchy distribution among the three domains of life. Recent work indicates that this pattern is likely the result of lateral gene transfer (LGT) of rhodopsin genes between major lineages, and even across domain boundaries. Within the lineage in which the microbial rhodopsins were initially discovered, the haloarchaea, a similar patchy distribution is observed. In this initial study, we assess the roles of LGT and gene loss in the evolution of haloarchaeal rhodopsin ion pump genes, using phylogenetics and comparative genomics approaches. Results Mapping presence/absence of rhodopsins onto the phylogeny of the RNA polymerase B' subunit (RpoB') of the haloarchaea supports previous notions that rhodopsins are patchily distributed. The phylogeny for the bacteriorhodopsin (BR) protein revealed two discrepancies in comparison to the RpoB' marker, while the halorhodopsin (HR) tree showed incongruence to both markers. Comparative analyses of bacteriorhodopsin-linked regions of five haloarchaeal genomes supported relationships observed in the BR tree, and also identified two open reading frames (ORFs) that were more frequently linked to the bacteriorhodopsin gene than those genes previously shown to be important to the function and expression of BR. Conclusion The evidence presented here reveals a complex evolutionary history for the haloarchaeal rhodopsins, with both LGT and gene loss contributing to the patchy distribution of rhodopsins within this <b>group.</b> <b>Similarities</b> between the BR and RpoB' phylogenies provide supportive evidence for the presence of bacteriorhodopsin in the last common ancestor of haloarchaea. Furthermore, two loci that we have designated bacterio-opsin associated chaperone (bac) and bacterio-opsin associated protein (bap) are inferred to have important roles in BR biogenesis based on frequent linkage and co-transfer with bacteriorhodopsin genes. </p...|$|E

To cope with missing or misleading features in images, researchers have introduced various ways to model the prior of shapes and use the prior to constrain active contours. However, the shape prior is usually learnt from a large set of annotated data, which is not always accessible in practice. Moreover, it is often doubted that the existing shapes in the training set will be sufficient to model the new instance in the testing image. In this paper, we propose to use the <b>group</b> <b>similarity</b> of object shapes in multiple images as a prior to aid segmentation, which {{can be interpreted as}} an unsupervised approach of shape prior modeling.
