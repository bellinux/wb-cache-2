25|$|Maitreya is {{typically}} pictured seated, with either both <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> or crossed at the ankles, on a throne, {{waiting for his}} time. He is dressed in the clothes of either a bhikṣu or Indian royalty. As a bodhisattva, he would usually be standing and dressed in jewels. Usually he wears a small stupa in his headdress that represents the stupa with relics of Gautama Buddha to help him identify it when his turn comes to lay claim to his succession and can be holding a dharmachakra resting on a lotus. A khata is always tied around his waist as a girdle.|$|E
25|$|Tamzara is an Armenian, Assyrian, Azerbaijani and Greek folk dance {{native to}} Anatolia. There are many {{versions}} of Tamzara, with slightly different music and steps, {{coming from the}} various regions and old villages in Anatolia.

Like most Anatolian folk dances, Tamzara is done with a large group of people with interlocked pinkies.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigation}} {{determined that}} the crew thought that the aircraft was higher than it actually was and that it flew into trees during its approach and crashed. Investigators found that the captain's altimeter (the left-hand altimeter) was adjusted to show a different altitude to the copilot's altimeter. The left altimeter's barometric sub-scale had been set to a pressure that {{would have resulted in}} it reading zero <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> at Sheremetyevo. However the sub-scale on the copilot's altimeter was set to a pressure that would have resulted in it reading the airport's height above mean sea level when on the ground at Sheremetyevo. This was against the airline's operating procedures, but the investigation could not determine the reason for the discrepancy.|$|E

500|$|Much of Ianto's {{character}} development is centred on the character's relationship with Captain Jack. On the character's evolution from minor character to romantic interest, Gareth David-Lloyd has commented that [...] "To have a storyline where you're {{involved with the}} leading character for any actor is awesome." [...] On the character's development, David-Lloyd has said that through Jack's relationship, [...] "he's found his meaning and ... he's happier." [...] Asked {{what it is that}} Ianto receives from Jack, David-Lloyd responds [...] "Support, meaning. I think he lost meaning. He was tortured and Jack gave him that meaning back. And reliability that he'll always be there, I think." [...] John Barrowman and Gareth David-Lloyd have also opined that Jack's relationship with Ianto has however brought out Jack's empathy, and helped to ground him, with John Barrowman reported as saying that Ianto [...] "brings out the 'human' in him, it brings out more of the empathy because he's actually fallen for someone and he really cares about somebody. So, it's really great and I think that's what makes him warm to other people. It makes him more approachable." [...] In the same interview, Gareth David-Lloyd said of the relationship and his character that [...] "I think Ianto's always made him care and that is really the heart of the show. Ianto's always bearing his emotional side and vulnerable side and keeping his <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> I think of all the characters, he's the one who tries to keep everyone else's <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> He brings everyone back to reality, often with a dry, witty remark or taking a dig at somebody just to sort of bring people back down." ...|$|E

At the same time, he reflected on the positive effects of his career in the ring, saying [...] "Boxing kept my <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and gave me a focus.

500|$|Although {{a soccer}} kick is a foul when {{delivered}} to the head in the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts which prevail in North America, the technique was commonly employed in Pride Fighting Championships in Japan. Fighters Wanderlei Silva and Mauricio Rua were notable practitioners of the soccer kick in MMA. Under the Unified Rules, some MMA fighters attempted to use tactics with the [...] "kicking {{the head of a}} grounded opponent" [...] rule, which defined a fighter as grounded if they had any part of their body apart from their <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> This meant that fighters, such as Jon Jones, would often try to provoke illegal soccer kicks by putting their hand on the ground or as a way to avoid strikes such as the soccer kick after a failed takedown. However, in 2013, referees were encouraged to interpret the rules that if a fighter is deliberately intending to provoke an illegal soccer kick and one was used, then the referee could decide that it was a legal move.|$|E

500|$|All of {{the songs}} on A Lesson in Romantics were written while touring after Warped Tour. The songs are about: [...] "being in a {{relationship}} while you're on the road, and the different hardships that come with that." [...] Unlike the band's EP, the album was [...] "more put together" [...] and [...] "more organized", according to Garcia. Sanders thought it stood up [...] "pretty well" [...] to the EP, noting that it was [...] "just as catchy [...] ", but [...] "more powerful." [...] "Jamie All Over" [...] was originally recorded by Kid Named Chicago, Lancaster's previous band. Sanders claimed the song was [...] "kind of a tough one to choose" [...] because the band {{had a lot of}} new material to choose from, but felt [...] "pretty happy" [...] with its inclusion. [...] "When I Get Home, You're So Dead" [...] {{was one of the first}} songs the band wrote. According to Garcia, the final track was called [...] "You Be the Anchor That Keeps My <b>Feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ground,</b> I'll Be the Wings That Keep Your Heart in the Clouds" [...] because the band was [...] "trying to be poetic".|$|E

500|$|... "Close My Eyes" [...] is a downtempo piano led song, {{which runs}} for a {{duration}} of four minutes and 19 seconds.

Her past {{is presented in the}} lyrics [...] "I was a wayward child, with {{the weight of the world}} that I held deep inside" [...] and [...] "Life was a winding road, and I learned many things little ones shouldn't know." [...] As described by David Browne for Entertainment Weekly, Carey [...] "paints herself" [...] in the lyrics as [...] "A wayward child, with the weight of the world". He also noted that the singer seems concerned that she had to grow up quicker than was perhaps necessary, in order to live her life in a controlled environment, [...] "Maybe I grew up a little too soon." [...] During the chorus, Carey lightens the mood of the song by singing about having courage to face times of adversity, [...] "But I closed my eyes, steadied my <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> raised my head to the sky.

500|$|Steiger {{was one of}} Hollywood's most {{respected}} character actors; Hutchinson described him as [...] "one of Hollywood's most charismatic and dynamic stars". Yet for Hutchinson, Steiger remained [...] "out of sympathy with Hollywood" [...] during his career, believing that accomplished actors often struggle to find challenging films as they got older. Steiger was an [...] "effusive talent" [...] according to Lucia Bozzola of The New York Times, and was particularly noted for his intense portrayal of offbeat, often volatile and crazed characters. After On the Waterfront (1954), Steiger became somewhat typecast for playing tough characters and villains, and grew increasingly frustrated playing the [...] "Mafia heavy or a near-psychopath" [...] during the 1970s, roles which he could play menacingly, but provided little opportunity for him to showcase his talent. Gossip columnist Louella Parsons hailed him as [...] "the Screen's No.1 Bad Man", while the newspaper London Evening News referred to him as [...] "the man you would love to hate {{if you had the}} coverage". A 1960 publication by Dean Jennings of The Saturday Evening Post referred to Steiger as an [...] "angry, hot-tempered newcomer of prodigious acting talents, [...] works best only at emotional white heat", and remarked that he found it [...] "stimulating to carry theatrical fantasy into his private life". Pauline Kael found his performances so powerful that she believed he [...] "often seems to take over a picture even when he isn't in the lead". The journal Films and Filming, surveying his career in 1971, noted that his talent [...] "developed steadily through films good and bad", and that the secret of his success was that he stayed grounded, citing a 1956 interview where he said [...] "I pity the player who can't keep his <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> It's too easy to trade on success and forget that no performer can stand still." ...|$|E
