25|$|Steffens was so {{troubled by}} the vituperation <b>heaped</b> <b>on</b> the McNamara {{brothers}} that he began a campaign to ease economic and class differences in the United States. By mid-1912, a number of prominent individuals — including social workers Jane Addams and Lillian Wald, industrialist Henry Morgenthau, Sr., journalist Paul Kellogg, jurist Louis Brandeis, economist Irving Fisher, and pacifist minister John Haynes Holmes—had asked President Taft to appoint a commission on industrial relations to ease economic tensions in the country. Taft requested that Congress approve a commission, and it did so on August 23, 1912. The reports of the Commission on Industrial Relations, led by Frank P. Walsh, helped establish the eight-hour day and the World War I-era War Labor Board, and profoundly influenced most New Deal labor legislation.|$|E
25|$|Gauri was {{received}} coldly by her father. Gauri, being an uninvited guest, {{was not given}} any respect. Furthermore, Dakshin began to insult Shiva. Gauri was unable to bear her father's insults toward her husband, had a heated argument about the virtues (and alleged lack thereof) of Shiva. Every passing moment made it clearer to Gauri that her father was entirely incapable of appreciating the many excellent qualities of her husband - the supreme divinity of the universe. The realization then came to Gauri that this abuse was being <b>heaped</b> <b>on</b> Shiva only because he had wed her; she {{was the cause of}} this dishonour to her husband. She was consumed by rage against her father and loathing for his mentality. Calling up a prayer that she may, in a future birth, be born the daughter of a father whom she could respect, Gauri invoked her yogic powers and immolated herself.|$|E

It was reported however that babies were not shot, but simply thrown into a pit and buried alive. By July 28, 1941, old and sick people had also been taken out of the ghetto in a separate incident. They were also murdered. The earthen cover <b>heaped</b> <b>on</b> the graves was quite thin, and two boys only slightly wounded and {{on the top of the}} heaped bodies dug themselves out and escaped.

He praised the show for going in directions atypical for sitcoms, like having the Ann and Chris break-up off-screen, and said [...] "Ann's character defies all the expectations <b>heaped</b> <b>on</b> her from two previous seasons". Steve Kandell of New York magazine said [...] "Indianapolis" [...] was {{not as strong as}} other third season episodes, but that it [...] "proves to be as emblematic of the show’s soft, gooey heart as any the series has done". In particular, Kandell praised how Ben is growing to love Pawnee, and how April and Andy donated their tips {{at the end of the}} episode. Hollywood.com writer Eric Sundermann said the writers took [...] "some risks outside of the characters' comfort zone" [...] in [...] "Indianapolis" [...] and that they worked, especially with Ann's character, who he felt opened up more than in past episodes. He also said Andy and April work well together because the characters seem so genuine with each other. Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic declared [...] "Indianapolis" [...] a great episode.

500|$|Given the {{off-season}} wrist surgery, Chappuis was questionable for the 1947 season. As the season got underway, Chappuis said the wrist was [...] "not as loose" [...] {{as it was}} in 1946, but he felt it was [...] "loose enough." [...] In the end, Chappuis broke his own Big Nine total offense record by gaining 1,405yards as compared with 1,284yards in 1946. He completed 48 out of 84passes for 976yards, including 11touchdown passes. He also scored 5touchdowns and gained 544yards rushing. In the season opener against Michigan State, Chappuis scored three touchdowns in a 55–0 victory, as Michigan outgained the Spartans 504yards rushing to 56. Michigan finished the 1947 season with a 21–0 victory over Ohio State. In his last game at Michigan Stadium, Chappuis set a Michigan single-game record for total offense that would last 20 years. Altogether, Chappuis accounted for 307yards, rushing for 90yards and completing 12 of 27 passes for 217yards. This stood as a school single-game total offense record for over 20years. At the end of the 1947 season, Chappuis was named a unanimous first-team All-American. He also finished second to Johnny Lujack in the 1947 Heisman Trophy voting, with Lujack receiving 742 first and second place votes to 555 for Chappuis. Despite the glowing adjectives <b>heaped</b> <b>on</b> him, reporters noted that [...] "Chappuis can still wear his regular size seven headgear." [...] Chappuis gave credit to his line saying, [...] "Anyone passing behind the protection that line gave me could have done as well." [...] In another sign of his modesty on a team with only two two-way players Chappuis said [...] "You have to smell where to go on pass defense—and my sniffer's not too good."

2500|$|Scriabin {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{innovative}} and most controversial of early modern composers. The Great Soviet Encyclopedia said of Scriabin that [...] "no composer has had more scorn <b>heaped</b> <b>on</b> him or greater love bestowed." [...] Leo Tolstoy described Scriabin's music as [...] "a sincere expression of genius." [...] Scriabin had a major impact on the music world over time, and influenced composers such as Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Prokofiev, and Nikolai Roslavets. However Scriabin's importance in the Russian and then Soviet musical scene, and internationally, drastically declined after his passing. According to his biographer Bowers, [...] "No one was more famous during their lifetime, and few were more quickly ignored after death." [...] Nevertheless, his musical aesthetics have been reevaluated, and his ten published sonatas for piano, which arguably provided the most consistent contribution to the genre since the time of Beethoven's set, have been increasingly championed.|$|E

Some reviewers who liked the album were critical of its musicianship, such as the Chicago Tribunes Greg Kot, as well as Jon Pareles of The New York Times, who wrote that [...] "onstage Mr. Dylan's touring band regularly supercharges his songs. But on Modern Times the musicians play as if they’re just feeling their way into the tunes." ...|$|E

[...] In his writing he was generally contemptuous of Spanish composers, and lavish in his praise of Italians (which may partially account for the abuse <b>heaped</b> <b>on</b> him by Spanish critics). [...] He discusses the previous theoretical treatises of Zarlino, Vicentino, Juan Bermudo and others; he describes in detail how a composer can achieve expressive intensity when writing masses, motets, madrigals, frottolas, canzonettas, canticles, hymns, psalms, lamentations, ricercares, tientos, strambotti, {{and other forms of}} the time. [...] The compositional ideal which he maintained was the style of Palestrina, though curiously he maintained that the [...] "rules" [...] of counterpoint were made to be broken, and should be abandoned as soon as a composer had learned his craft: [...] paradoxically, even in the 21st century, no style of composition is taught in a more rigorous, rule-based way than the polyphonic idiom of Palestrina.|$|E

The Banū Matrūh were left in power in Tripoli, and in Sfax Roger appointed Umar ibn al-Husayn al-Furrīānī, whose father was brought to Sicily as a hostage for his son's good behaviour.

Although American democracy promotion efforts in the MENA region take a more balanced top-down/bottom-up strategy than those of the European Union and engage in more politically sensitive areas such as state institution building, some question the assumption that pushing for liberalizing reforms is a worthwhile endeavor given that regimes can easily de-liberalize and reforms are often cosmetic and do not alter the real balance of effective governing power. [...] Furthermore, promoting DG in the MENA region operating on the assumption that proper counsel and expert advice can guide a government to reform ignores the possibility that regimes are not necessarily [...] "neutral apparatus representing public interests" [...] and may be resistant to relinquishing power.|$|E
