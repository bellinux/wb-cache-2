5|$|Borislow's most {{successful}} <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> Toccet, who won four graded stakes, including the Champagne and Hollywood Futurity in 2002. Toccet's {{name is a}} misspelled tribute to former National Hockey League (NHL) player Rick Tocchet. The <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> named runner-up to Vindication for the American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt in 2002, {{a part of the}} Eclipse Award. Once a favorite to enter the 2003 Kentucky Derby, Toccet was derailed by ankle injuries early in the year. He won one listed stakes after his juvenile season out of 15 starts and now stands at Castleton Lyons.|$|E
5|$|Although a large {{horse is}} not {{required}} to carry an armoured knight, it is held by some historians that a large <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> desirable to increase the power of a lance strike. However, practical experiments by re-enactors have suggested that the rider's weight and strength is of more relevance than the size of the mount, and that little of the horse's weight is translated to the lance.|$|E
5|$|Many {{different}} types and sizes of horse {{were used in}} war, depending on the form of warfare. The type used varied with whether the <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> being ridden or driven, and whether they were being used for reconnaissance, cavalry charges, raiding, communication, or supply. Throughout history, mules and donkeys as well as horses {{played a crucial role}} in providing support to armies in the field.|$|E
5000|$|This {{is clearly}} true for N = 1 (i.e. one <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> a group {{where all the}} <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> the same colour). Thus, by induction, N <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> the same colour for any {{positive}} integer N. i.e. all <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> the same colour.|$|R
5|$|Communication {{between human}} and <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> {{paramount}} in any equestrian activity; to aid this process <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> usually ridden with a saddle {{on their backs}} to assist the rider with balance and positioning, and a bridle or related headgear to assist the rider in maintaining control. Sometimes <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> ridden without a saddle, and occasionally, <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> trained to perform without a bridle or other headgear. Many <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> also driven, which requires a harness, bridle, and some type of vehicle.|$|R

5|$|Many rituals {{were used}} to {{identify}} a vampire. One method of finding a vampire's grave involved leading a virgin boy through a graveyard or church grounds on a virgin stallion—the horse would supposedly balk at the grave in question. Generally a black <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> required, though in Albania it should be white. Holes appearing in the earth over a grave were taken {{as a sign of}} vampirism.|$|E
5|$|To {{defy the}} prophecies, Oleg sent the horse away. Many {{years later he}} asked where his <b>horse</b> <b>was,</b> and was told it had died. He asked to see the remains and {{was taken to the}} place where the bones lay. When he touched the horse's skull with his boot a snake slithered from the skull and bit him. Oleg died, thus {{fulfilling}} the prophecy.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} isotope data of La Brea dire wolf fossils dated 10,000YBP {{provides}} {{evidence that the}} <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> an important prey species at the time, and that sloth, mastodon, bison, and camel were less common in the dire wolf diet. This indicates that the dire wolf was not a prey specialist, and {{at the close of}} the late Pleistocene before its extinction it was hunting or scavenging the most available herbivores.|$|E

5000|$|The {{process of}} {{training}} a guide <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> rigorous and takes about eight months for each horse. [...] Initially, the <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> trained in basic lead work, {{in which the}} <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> taught to move at the speed that the handler commands and to navigate common obstacles. Next, the <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> trained in voice command recognition, and taught to respond to 23 voice commands. The <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> then taught to maneuver around both stationary and moving obstacles. After this, the <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> trained to signal to the handler {{when there is a}} step or ramp. Finally, the <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> housebroken, generally an easy process because of horses’ natural aversion to depositing fecal waste indoors. Intelligent disobedience is a crucial part of the training of the guide horse, as the <b>horse</b> must <b>be</b> able to disregard any commands that would be unsafe to the horse and the handler.|$|R
5000|$|The {{number of}} horses reached a peak in 1789 when 270 <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> stabled at Christiansborg. In {{the course of}} the 20th century, the <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> {{gradually}} replaced by cars and today about 20 <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> stabled in the Royal Stables.|$|R
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} from various {{sites on the}} Iberian peninsula suggest the domestication {{of plants and animals}} between 6,000 and 4,500 BC. Céide Fields in Ireland, consisting of extensive tracts of land enclosed by stone walls, date to 3,500 BC and are the oldest known field systems in the world. The <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> domesticated in the Pontic steppe around 4,000 BC. In Siberia, Cannabis was in use in China in Neolithic times and may have been domesticated there; it was in use both as a fibre for ropemaking and as a medicine in Ancient Egypt by about 2,350 BC.|$|E
5|$|Bond visits Ascot Racecourse {{to observe}} the company's owner, Max Zorin. Zorin's horse wins a race but proves hard to control. Sir Godfrey Tibbett, a racehorse trainer and MI6 agent, {{believes}} that Zorin's <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> drugged, although tests proved negative. Through Tibbett, Bond meets with French private detective Achille Aubergine who informs Bond that Zorin is holding a horse sale later in the month. During their dinner at the Eiffel Tower, Aubergine is assassinated by Zorin's bodyguard May Day, who subsequently escapes after being chased by Bond.|$|E
5|$|By mid-morning, Ney {{had moved}} toward the front with Gazan's brigade {{and he could see}} the enemy {{advancing}} toward him; still expecting Soult's reinforcements on his flanks, he anticipated an easy victory, like the one three days earlier in which Masséna's force had pounded Hotze's column at Frauenfeld. He did not realise, at least not yet, that Hotze had 8,000men with which to secure the crossroads north of Winterthur. Ney brought more of his men to the front, and moved against the Austrian left. In an Austrian volley, he and his horse went down; the <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> killed and Ney received a knee injury. He had his wound bandaged, called for another horse, and reentered the fight.|$|E

25|$|Immediately {{after the}} war ended, the division's <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> taken to the Imperial Remount Depot at Moascar in Egypt.

5|$|Domestication of {{the horse}} most likely took place in central Asia prior to 3500 BC. Two major sources of {{information}} are used to determine where and when the <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> first domesticated and how the domesticated horse spread around the world. The first source is based on palaeological and archaeological discoveries; the second source is a comparison of DNA obtained from modern horses to that from bones and teeth of ancient horse remains.|$|E
5|$|Horses were {{probably}} ridden in prehistory {{before they were}} driven. However, evidence is scant, mostly simple images of human figures on horse-like animals drawn on rock or clay. The earliest tools used to control horses were bridles of various sorts, which were invented nearly {{as soon as the}} <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> domesticated. Evidence of bit wear appears on the teeth of horses excavated at the archaeology sites of the Botai culture in northern Kazakhstan, dated 35003000 BC.|$|E
5|$|In some legends, Marko's wonder <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> a {{gift from}} a vila. A Serbian story says {{that he was looking}} for a horse who could bear him. To test a steed, he would grab him by the tail and sling him over his shoulder. Seeing a diseased piebald foal owned by some carters, Marko grabbed him by the tail but could not move him. He bought (and cured) the foal, naming him Šarac. He became an {{enormously}} powerful horse and Marko's inseparable companion. Macedonian legend has it that Marko, following a vilas advice, captured a sick horse on a mountain and cured him. Crusted patches on the horse's skin grew white hairs, and he became a piebald.|$|E

5|$|In {{the regions}} of Saint-Lo and Cotentin, the Norman Cob was {{widespread}} in agricultural uses until 1950, and the population continued to increase {{in the first half}} of the 20th century, even through the occupation during World War II. Even the Percheron, which was internationally recognized as the Norman draft <b>horse,</b> <b>was</b> not as popular in the homeland of the Norman Cob breed. In 1945, Norman Cob stallions accounted for 40% of the conscripted horses, and in 1950 a studbook was created for the breed.|$|E

5|$|Large, heavy horses, {{weighing}} from , {{the ancestors}} of today's draught horses, were used, particularly in Europe, from the Middle Ages onward. They pulled heavy loads like supply wagons and were disposed to remain calm in battle. Some historians believe they may have carried the heaviest-armoured knights of the European Late Middle Ages, though others dispute this claim, indicating that the destrier, or knight's battle <b>horse,</b> <b>was</b> a medium-weight animal. It is also disputed whether the destrier class included draught animals or not. Breeds at the smaller end of the heavyweight category may have included {{the ancestors of}} the Percheron, agile for their size and physically able to manoeuvre in battle.|$|E

50|$|In early years, <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> {{incredibly}} important to {{farmers in the}} Montmartre area, as they were the primary work animals on a farm. As farms became larger, more land was broken for raising crops. <b>Horses</b> <b>were</b> instrumental in {{the breaking of the}} land, as well as the subsequent farming activities. Steel plows were used by farmers, and required the strength of horses to pull them as they turned up the soil for planting. As plows became larger and more complex, more <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> required. <b>Horses</b> <b>were</b> also required to pull seeding and harvest equipment.|$|R
5|$|On both fronts, the <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> {{also used}} as a pack animal. Because railway lines could not {{withstand}} artillery bombardments, horses carried ammunition and supplies between the railheads and the rear trenches, though the horses generally were not used in the actual trench zone. This role of horses was critical, and thus horse fodder was the single largest commodity shipped to the front by some countries. Following the war, many cavalry regiments were converted to mechanised, armoured divisions, with light tanks developed to perform many of the cavalry's original roles.|$|E
5|$|One {{isolated}} Covenanter brigade {{that stood}} its ground {{was at the}} right of their front line and consisted of the regiments of the Earl of Crawford-Lindsay and Viscount Maitland. Lucas launched three cavalry charges against them. In the third charge, Lucas's <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> killed, and he was taken prisoner. Behind them, Lumsden reformed the reserve of the allied centre, pushing four regiments (those of the Earl of Cassilis, William Douglas of Kilhead, Lord Coupar and the Earl of Dunfermline) and part of the Clydesdale Regiment forward into the breach in the allied front line. Behind them in turn, the Earl of Manchester's regiment repulsed and scattered Blakiston's brigade.|$|E
