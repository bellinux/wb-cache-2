50|$|Tetramethylurea is {{miscible}} with {{a variety}} of organic compounds, including acids such as acetic acid or bases such as pyridine and an excellent solvent for organic substances such as ε-caprolactam or benzoic acid and dissolves even some inorganic salts such as silver nitrate or sodium iodide.

50|$|Many {{modifications}} {{have been}} reported that influence the reactivity of this reagent. The compound adopts a complex cluster structure (the adjacent picture is a simplified cartoon), and additives that modify the cluster affect the reactivity of the reagent.

50|$|Some {{examples}} of functionality reduced by SmI2 are provided below.The reactivity of SmI2 is significantly {{affected by the}} choice of solvent. The use of <b>hexamethylphosphoramide</b> (HMPA) as a co-solvent in samarium iodide reductions allows the reaction {{to be carried out}} under much milder conditions than in its absence. It has recently been investigated and determined that tripyrrolidinophosphoric acid triamide (TPPA) can be used in lieu of HMPA as an activator for SmI2 reductions, producing faster reactions and similar yields while avoiding the use of a known carcinogen. In general, polar solvents increase the strength of samarium iodide as a reducing agent.|$|E
50|$|The {{structures}} of organolithium compounds {{are affected by}} the presence of Lewis bases such as e.g., tetrahydrofuran (THF), diethyl ether (Et2O), tetramethylethylene diamine (TMEDA) or <b>hexamethylphosphoramide</b> (HMPA). Methyllithium is a special case, in which solvation with ether, or polar additive HMPA does not deaggregate the tetrameric structure in the solid state. On the other hand, THF deaggregates hexameric butyl lithium: the tetramer is the major species, and ΔG for interconversion between tetramer and dimer is around 11 kcal/mol. TMEDA can also chelate to the lithium cations in n-butyllithium and form solvated dimers such as LiBu-n)2. Phenyllithium has been shown to exist as a distorted tetramer in the crystallized ether solvate, and as a mixture of dimer and tetramer in ether solution.|$|E
50|$|Isomerization of {{epoxides}} to allylic alcohols under strongly {{basic conditions}} proceeds by a β-elimination process. A {{model has been}} advanced that invokes an initial complex between the lithium amide base and epoxide. Concerted C-O bond cleavage and deprotonation proceeds via a syn transition state to give an allylic alkoxide, which is protonated upon workup. Deprotonation typically occurs at the most kinetically accessible site, and trans double bonds form with high stereoselectivity. Significant non-bonding interactions exist in the transition state for cis double bond formation.(2)Other processes may take place competitively under basic conditions, particularly when β-elimination is slow or not possible. These pathways likely begin with lithiation of a carbon in the epoxide ring, followed by α-elimination to afford a carbene intermediate. 1,2-hydrogen migration leads to ketones, while intramolecular C-H insertion affords cyclic alcohols {{with the formation of}} a new carbon-carbon bond.(3)In many cases when <b>hexamethylphosphoramide</b> (HMPA) is used as an additive with lithium amide bases, selectivity for the formation of allylic alcohols increases. These reactions are believed to proceed through E2 elimination.|$|E
50|$|Twaron is a p-phenylene terephthalamide (PpPTA), the {{simplest}} {{form of the}} AABB para polyaramide. PpPTA {{is a product of}} p-phenylene diamine (PPD) and terephthaloyl dichloride (TDC). To dissolve the aromatic polymer Twaron used a co-solvent of N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) and an ionic component (calcium chloride CaCl2) to occupy the hydrogen bonds of the amide groups. The invention of this specific process was done in 1974 at AKZO Research Laboratory in Arnhem by a team consisting of Leo Vollbracht, Teun Veerman (assistant of Leo Vollbracht) and Wim Engelhard (trainee, who actually discovered NMP as the appropriate solvent to keep the growing polymer as long as possible in solution; he also discovered that high speed mixing of PPD and TDC was necessary to obtain a sufficiently long polymer chains). The patent of the newly discovered process route led to a patent war between AKZO (Fibre X) and DuPont (Fibre B) as Dupont initially used the carcinogenic HMPT (<b>hexamethylphosphoramide).</b> Despite heavy research DuPont now also applies the AKZO patent for their Kevlar process and use the less hazardous NMP.|$|E
5000|$|Reductive desulfonylation {{reactions}} lead to {{the replacement}} of a carbon-sulfur bond in the sulfonyl group with a carbon-hydrogen bond. Because the sulfonyl group is by definition attached to two carbons, however, reduction to two sets of products is possible. Mechanistic studies of reductions employing metal amalgams as the reducing agent suggest that upon electron transfer to the sulfone, fragmentation to a sulfinate anion and the more stable organic radical occurs. Immediate reduction of the radical and protonation then occur to afford the sulfur-free product derived from the more stable radical. Thus, S-alkyl bonds are cleaved in preference to S-aryl or S-alkenyl bonds.Samarium(II) iodide {{may be used to}} reductively cleave α-keto sulfones; in the presence of <b>hexamethylphosphoramide</b> (HMPA), SmI2 is able to effect reductive elimination of α-functionalized sulfones (see equation (...) below).Tin hydrides reduce α-keto and allylic sulfones. The mechanisms of these processes involve the addition of a tin-centered radical to the substrate followed by elimination of a sulfinyl radical, which abstracts a hydrogen from a molecule of tin hydride to propagate the radical chain. Protonation of the organotin intermediates thus formed (by sulfinic acid generated in situ) leads to reduced products. Addition of a stoichiometric amount of proton source allows the use of tin hydride in catalytic amounts. Although desulfonylations of allylic sulfones are site selective (providing only products of allylic transposition), they are not stereoselective and afford mixtures of double bond isomers. The mechanism of desulfonylation of α-keto sulfones is similar.Transition-metal-mediated reductive desulfonylations rely on the generation of an intermediate π-allyl complex, which undergoes nucleophilic attack by hydride or another nucleophile to afford reduced products. Nucleophilic attack generally occurs at the less substituted position of the π-allyl moiety, although site selectivity depends strongly on the substrate and reaction conditions. Palladium(0) complexes are the most commonly used precatalysts.|$|E

In the present work, detection of <b>Hexamethylphosphoramide</b> by using a polyaniline coated polyurethane membrane was carried out and device is constructed to show its practical application using resistivity assessment technique.

A modified synthetic method used to coat polyaniline onto a polyurethane membrane found to be effective to prepare a uniform and electrically conductive coating and promising for sensing a carcinogen like <b>Hexamethylphosphoramide.</b> Sensing performance may be attributed to the large resistance change in polyaniline because of the deprotonation when exposed to the <b>Hexamethylphosphoramide</b> environment.
