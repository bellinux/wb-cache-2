25|$|According to Derkx, freethought {{serves to}} get one closer to the truth. To {{be able to think}} freely, freedom of expression, free inquiry, freedom of association, freedom of {{assembly}} and tolerance are essential. All relevant possibilites about <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> is and works or should work, may be considered, discussed, investigated and argued out, despite potential aversion one may have regarding certain ideas. In the end, true knowledge is not achieved by any individual alone, but by a free exchange of thoughts with others. All ideas may be proposed and also criticised, no single opinion may be excluded.|$|E
25|$|The novel Darwin's Dreams by Sean Hoade was {{published}} in 2008 and republished in a new edition in 2016. The novel begins with {{the first meeting of}} Darwin and FitzRoy and ends with Darwin receiving notice of FitzRoy's suicide. The plot is interlaced with fictional ″dreams″ that imagine <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> would be if the ideas of evolutionary thinkers over the millennia had been literally true. The dreams also show how Darwin′s subconscious dealt with major themes in his life such as the death of his beloved daughter Annie and his lifelong friendship and rivalry with FitzRoy.|$|E
25|$|Richardson et al. {{provide the}} example of {{behavioral}} therapy and psychodynamic therapy. If a therapist wanted to understand <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> affects his clients, he might integrate behavioral therapy into his practice. But, once he wanted to understand the inner dynamics of the psyche, {{he would have to}} integrate psychodynamic therapy in with behavioral therapy. The problem is that psychodynamic therapy says human suffering is caused by the conflicts and turmoil within the inner psyche while behavioral therapy says that human suffering is caused by external stimuli, reinforcement, and other forms of conditioning. These two theories are in direct contradiction to each other.|$|E

25|$|Edward Fredkin and Konrad Zuse {{pioneered the}} idea of a computable universe, the former by writing a line in his book on <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> might be like a {{cellular}} automaton, and later further developed by Fredkin using a toy model called Salt. It has been claimed that NKS tries to take these ideas as its own but Wolfram's model of the universe if a rewriting network and not a cellular automaton as Wolfram himself has suggested a cellular automaton cannot account for relativistic features such as no absolute time frame. Jürgen Schmidhuber has also charged that his work on Turing machine-computable physics was stolen without attribution, namely his idea on enumerating possible Turing-computable universes.|$|E
25|$|Yamada {{eventually}} becomes {{affiliated with}} Ryu, and updates the latter on <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> has {{reacted to the}} events in Neo-Tokyo; they later learn that an American naval fleet lingers nearby. Tetsuo becomes heavily dependent on government-issued pills to quell his headaches. Seeking answers, he visits Lady Miyako at her temple and is given a comprehensive history of the government project that unleashed Akira. Miyako advises Tetsuo to quit the pills {{in order to become}} more powerful; Tetsuo begins an agonizing withdrawal. Meanwhile, Tetsuo's aide, the Captain, stages an unsuccessful Empire assault on Miyako's temple. After the Colonel uses SOL to attack the Empire's army, a mysterious event opens a rift in the sky dumping massive debris from Akira's second explosion... as well as Kaneda.|$|E
25|$|Dilthey {{took some}} of his {{inspiration}} from the works of Friedrich Schleiermacher on hermeneutics, which he helped revive. Both figures are linked to German Romanticism. Schleiermacher was strongly influenced by German Romanticism which led him to place more emphasis on human emotion and the imagination. Dilthey, in his turn, {{as the author of}} a vast monograph on Schleiermacher, responds to the questions raised by Droysen and Ranke about the philosophical legitimation of the human sciences. He argues that 'scientific explanation of nature' (erklären) must be completed with a theory of <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> is given to human beings through symbolically mediated practices. To provide such a theory is the aim of the philosophy of the humanities—a field of study to which Dilthey dedicated his entire academic career.|$|E

25|$|Pascal Boyer {{is one of}} {{the leading}} figures in the {{cognitive}} psychology of religion, a new field of inquiry that is less than fifteen years old, which accounts for the psychological processes that underlie religious thought and practice. In his book Religion Explained, Boyer shows that there is no simple explanation for religious consciousness. Boyer is mainly concerned with explaining the various psychological processes involved in the acquisition and transmission of ideas concerning the gods. Boyer builds on the ideas of cognitive anthropologists Dan Sperber and Scott Atran, who first argued that religious cognition represents a by-product of various evolutionary adaptations, including folk psychology, and purposeful violations of innate expectations about <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> is constructed (for example, bodiless beings with thoughts and emotions) that make religious cognitions striking and memorable.|$|E
25|$|The {{first episode}} of Chef! was {{developed}} over two years, and so Peter Tilbury and I were really put through loads of hoops about character motivation. Why is this character such an arsehole? Is this {{the right kind}} of character for Lenny Henry to be playing? All that kind of stuff. Once we got through that and they greenlit the series, Peter then had something like eight or nine weeks to write the rest of it. The remaining five episodes were much easier to write because we'd had every argument about who, what, where, and <b>how.</b> <b>The</b> <b>world</b> had been mapped out. Actually, the very first episode of Chef! was the hardest one to watch for me because we'd worked so hard on it and you could see all the things that had been rewritten in the first episode.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} way, Stewart centers {{the first half}} of Earth Abides on the forces of natural and {{artificial}} selection. In freeing the landscape from humans, half of the book is devoted to looking at <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> would change in their absence. Stewart chose to make his main human character an ecologist, and sends him on a cross-country tour, to see what the world is like without people. As animals and plants no longer have humans taking care of them or controlling them, they are free to breed uncontrolled and to prey upon one another. The main character sees that some have been under humans so long that they are helpless in the face of change, while others are still able to adapt and survive. Stewart shows that humans have routinely influenced the lives of almost every plant and animal around them.|$|E

25|$|Vidura's {{pilgrimage to}} various holy places {{provides}} {{the backdrop for}} the stories and spiritual teachings in Book 3. Near the Yamuna River Vidura meets Uddhava, who gives him {{the news of the}} Kurukshetra War and about Krishna's death in chapter 1 of Book 3 (this is described in greater detail in chapters 30 and 31 of Book 11 as well). Vidura then meets the sage Maitreya, and learns <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> came into being, the divisions of time, and other subjects of cosmology. The story of the birth of Hiranyakasipu and Hiranyaksa is told, including the latter's death at the hands of Varaha, the boar avatar of Vishnu. An important story is the tale of Devahuti and her son Kapila, thus folding in one version of the teachings of the Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy. Kapila's Samkhya teachings help lead her to final liberation.|$|E
25|$|Kant then asks {{why we have}} {{to follow}} the {{principle}} of morality. He is forced to “admit that no interest impels me to do so”. He says that we clearly do “regard ourselves as free in acting and so to hold ourselves yet subject to certain laws” but wonders how this is possible. He then explains just how it is possible, by appealing to the two perspectives that we can consider ourselves under. According to Kant, human beings cannot know the ultimate structure of reality. Whilst humans experience the world as having three spatial dimensions and as being extended in time, we cannot say anything about how reality ultimately is, from a god's-eye perspective. From this god's-eye perspective the world may be nothing like the way it appears to human beings. We cannot get out of our heads and leave our human perspective on the world to know what it is like independently of our own viewpoint; we can only know about <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> appears to us, not about <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> is in itself. Kant calls the world as it appears to us {{from our point of view}} the world of sense or of appearances. The world from a god's-eye perspective is the world of things in themselves or the “world of understanding”. It is the distinction between these two perspectives that Kant appeals to in explaining how freedom is possible. Insofar as we take ourselves to be exercising our free will, Kant argues, we have to consider ourselves from the perspective of the world of understanding. It is only in the world of understanding that it makes sense to talk of free wills. In the world of appearances, everything is determined by physical laws, and there is no room for a free will to change the course of events. If you consider yourself as part of the world of appearances, then you cannot think of yourself as having a will that brings things about.|$|E
