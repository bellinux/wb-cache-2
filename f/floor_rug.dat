5000|$|In December 1925, Ray {{was forced}} to file for {{bankruptcy}} after being sued {{by more than a}} dozen creditors for monies owed and back taxes. His production company also declared bankruptcy. Actress Jane Novak later recalled that Ray's wife Clara Grant (whom he married in November 1915) contributed to Ray's egomania and spendthrift ways. The couple lived in a lavish Beverly Hills home equipped with gold doorknobs, several lacquered pianos, black marble bathtubs with gold fixtures and a full sized tree made of semi-precious stones that sat in their bathroom. They employed a full staff of servants and owned a fleet of luxury cars.

50|$|Rug hooking {{as we know}} {{it today}} may have {{developed}} in North America, specifically along the Eastern Seaboard in New England in the United States, the Canadian Maritimes, and Newfoundland and Labrador. In its earliest years, rug hooking was a craft of poverty. The vogue for floor coverings in the United States came about after 1830 when factories produced machine-made carpets for the rich. Poor women began looking through their scrap bags for materials to employ in creating their own home-made floor coverings. Women employed whatever materials they had available. Girls from wealthy families were sent to school to learn embroidery and quilting; fashioning <b>floor</b> <b>rugs</b> and mats was never part of the curriculum. Another sign that hooking was the pastime of the poor is the fact that popular ladies magazines in the 19th century never wrote about rug hooking. It was considered a country craft in the days when the word country, used in this context, was derogatory. Today rug hooking or mat making as it is sometimes referred to has been labeled in Canada as a fine art.|$|R

40|$|The {{making of}} rep weave floor {{coverings}} {{was an important}} source of income in Avinurme, a northern Estonian settlement, from the 1950 s to the 1970 s. Weaving began for commercial reasons after collective farms were established in 1949, when alternative sources of income were sought, given that such farms only paid meagre wages. At the time, any sort of entrepreneurship was prohibited and punishable as “speculation” and thussales activities were banned, so the sellers sought to leave village council inspectors with the impression that the weaving was being done for their own family. A unique cultural phenomenon thus developed, which was shaped (and eventually fell into decline) for the following period-specific reasons: cotton yarn could be obtained from the Kreenholm textile mill in Narva. This was suited to the rep weaving technique; <b>floor</b> <b>rugs</b> were not available in shops; all households had looms; and rep weave rugs were considered to be more classy than rag rugs. In spite of the illegality of the activity, commercial weaving persisted for decades. Due to the wide territorial range of the sales, the Avinurme rugs had an impact on home furnishing culture almost all over Estonia. The special feature of the Avinurme practice was the use of a thinner and finer pattern warp (the so-called no. 10 thread) in conjunction with a thicker and coarser background warp; the dark weft is visible through the thin warp and is conducive to the formation of the pattern. Other features peculiar to the Avinurme rep woven rugs include composition featuring a double cross of rhombuses, which are not to be found in any printed source. In addition, the region in question had a rich array of patterns of combinations of squares and rectangles. Brown often featured as the warp colour in combination with beige or orange tones; the background warp was frequently made up of brightly coloured lengthwise-striped patterns along the patterned edges. The tradition of weaving these types of rugs and blankets started to decline in the late 1970 s when industrially-produced floor coverings became available in retail stores, leading to changes in interior furnishing fashions. Purchasing power had also improved over the decades, and hand-woven traditional floor coverings were seen as old-fashioned in this context...|$|R
