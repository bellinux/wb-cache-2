5|$|The {{film was}} assumed to have been lost for many years until a paper copy was {{identified}} in 1968 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Library</b> <b>of</b> Congress Paper Print archive by Michael Pointer, a historian of Sherlock Holmes films. Because motion pictures were not covered by copyright laws until 1912, paper prints were submitted by studios wishing to register their works. These were made using light-sensitive paper of the same width and length as the film itself, and developed as though a still photograph. Both the Edison Company and the Biograph Company submitted entire motion pictures as paper prints, {{and it is in}} this form that most of them survive. The film has subsequently been transferred to 16 mm film <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Library</b> <b>of</b> Congress collection.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on January 31, 1911 and was met with generally favorable reviews.

5|$|The one reel drama, {{approximately}} 1000 feet long, {{was released}} on May 27, 1910.

5|$|After the war, Christie {{attempted}} to get command {{of operations for}} Atlantic submarines, but that job went to James Fife instead. However, Christie was given command of naval forces in the Philippines. He retired from the Navy on 1 August 1949, with tombstone promotion {{to the rank of}} vice admiral. He sold life insurance and dabbled in other ventures for some time. In his final years, he lived on the west coast of the United States and in Hawaii. Christie died in Honolulu, Hawaii on 19 December 1987 at the age of 94. His wife, LaRene, joined him at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific following her death on 31 May 2002. His papers are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Library</b> <b>of</b> Congress.|$|E
5|$|An {{authoritative}} {{version of}} Marco Polo's book does not and cannot exist, {{for the early}} manuscripts differ significantly. The published editions of his book either rely on single manuscripts, blend multiple versions together, or add notes to clarify, for example in the English translation by Henry Yule. The 1938 English translation by A.C. Moule and Paul Pelliot {{is based on a}} Latin manuscript found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>library</b> <b>of</b> the Cathedral of Toledo in 1932, and is 50% longer than other versions. Approximately 150 manuscript copies in various languages are known to exist, and before availability of the printing press discrepancies were inevitably introduced during copying and translation. The popular translation published by Penguin Books in 1958 by R.E. Latham works several texts together to make a readable whole.|$|E

5|$|Everybody Saves Father and The Only Girl in Camp were {{released}} {{together on a}} single reel, approximately 1,000 feet in length, on January 10, 1911. The total length of Everybody Saves Father is approximately 450 feet long and the Only Girl in Camp is 480 feet long. Though both films were on a split reel, sometimes the films were advertised independently or listed Everybody Saves Father only. Theaters showing the one or possibly both films are known in North Carolina Indiana, Texas, Kansas, Arizona, Pennsylvania, and California. A surviving nitrate print of The Only Girl in Camp was sold on eBay in 2009. The film was purchased and deposited <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Library</b> <b>of</b> Congress for preservation.|$|E
5|$|Kansas Saloon Smashers {{became a}} success upon its March release, and {{inspired}} other films about Nation {{to be produced}} by Lubin Manufacturing Company and Biograph Company.
