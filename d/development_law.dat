The <b>development</b> <b>laws</b> of high-temperature annular buoyant jets were analyzed and compared with previous studies, including radial velocity distribution, axial velocity and temperature decay, reattachment position, cross-section diameter, volumetric flow rate, and velocity field characteristics with different pressures at the exhaust hood inlet. The results showed that when the ratio of outer diameter to inner diameter of the annulus was smaller than 5 / 2, the flow-field characteristics had significant difference compared to circular buoyant jets with the same outer diameter. For similar diameter ratios, reattachment in this paper occurred further downstream in contrast to previous study. Besides, the <b>development</b> <b>laws</b> of volumetric flow rate and cross-section diameter were given with different initial parameters. In addition, through analyzing air distribution characteristics under the coupling effect of high-temperature annular buoyant jets and ventilation system, it could be found that the position where maximum axial velocity occurred was changing gradually when the pressure at the exhaust hood inlet changed from 0 [*]Pa to − 5 [*]Pa...|$|R

25|$|Social work is an {{academic}} discipline and profession that concerns itself with individuals, families, groups and communities {{in an effort}} to enhance social functioning and overall well-being. Social functioning refers {{to the way in which}} people perform their social roles, and the structural institutions that are provided to sustain them. Social work applies social sciences, such as sociology, psychology, political science, public health, community <b>development,</b> <b>law,</b> and economics, to engage with client systems, conduct assessments, and develop interventions to solve social and personal problems; and create social change. Social work practice is often divided into micro-work, which involves working directly with individuals or small groups; and macro-work, which involves working communities, and within social policy, to create change on a larger scale.|$|E
25|$|The Teehankee Center is a student-based {{research}} and policy organization of the Ateneo Law School, supported by the Chief Justice Claudio Teehankee foundation. It {{is devoted to the}} study of the rule of law, a legal philosophy that seeks to address the question of how to build a society and country governed by stable and reasoned laws and policies, and where the needs of economic development and individual freedoms are balanced. The Center arranges fora for scholars, members of academe, and political and business leaders. Its lectures and fora focus on rule of law issues involving ethics and the legal profession, economic development and constitutional principles, judicial history, and legal theory. It also holds the collection of legal and private papers of Chief Justice Teehankee. The Center seeks to build on the collection through the contribution of leading lawyers and academicians as ably assisted by various research volunteers in fields such as the Rule of Law and Legal Theory, Constitutional Law, E-commerce, International Law, <b>Development</b> <b>Law,</b> and other legal issues.|$|E
25|$|Pupils, {{students}} {{and children in}} kindergartens were incorporated into the accident insurance scheme, which benefited 11 million children. Free medical checkups were introduced that same year, while the Farmers' Sickness Insurance Law (1972) introduced compulsory sickness insurance for independent farmers, family workers in agriculture, and pensioners under the farmers' pension scheme, medical benefits for all covered groups, and cash benefits for family workers under compulsory coverage for pension insurance. Participation in employer's health insurance was extended to four million employees. A <b>Development</b> <b>Law</b> of December 1970 {{made it possible for}} all employees voluntarily to become members of the statutory sickness insurance. The level of income for compulsory sickness insurance was indexed to 75% of the respective assessment level for pension insurance, while voluntarily insured employees were granted a claim to an allowance towards their sickness insurance from their employer. This law also introduced a new type of sickness insurance benefit, namely facilities for the early diagnosis of disease. Apart from the discretionary service of disease prevention which had existed since 1923, insured persons now had a right in certain circumstances to medical examinations aimed at the early diagnosis of disease. According to one study, this marked a change in the concept of sickness insurance: it now aimed at securing good health.|$|E
