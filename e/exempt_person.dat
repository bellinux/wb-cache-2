40|$|To request Commission {{approval}} of {{the publication of a}} proposed rule in the Federal Register for public comment. This proposed rule includes miscellaneous amendments to Parts 30, 31, 32, and 150, regarding the use of byproduct material under exemptions from licensing and under general licenses, and regarding the requirements for those who distribute products and materials for use under exemptions from licensing. SUMMARY: The proposed rule would amend the regulations governing the use of byproduct material to revise requirements for reporting transfers to <b>persons</b> <b>exempt</b> from licensing, simplify the licensing of smoke detector distribution, remove obsolete provisions, and clarify certain regulatory provisions. These actions are intended to better ensure the protection of public health and safety, make the licensing of distribution to <b>exempt</b> <b>persons</b> more effective and efficient, and reduce unnecessary regulatory burden to certain general licensees. These changes would affect users of certain generally licensed devices, persons holding certain byproduct materials under exemption, and licensees who distribute byproduct material to <b>exempt</b> <b>persons.</b> CONTACTS...|$|R
5000|$|FinCEN was {{established}} by order of the Secretary of the Treasury (Treasury Order Numbered 105-08) on April 25, 1990. In May 1994, its mission was broadened to include regulatory responsibilities, and in October 1994 the Treasury Department's precursor of FinCEN, the Office of Financial Enforcement was merged with FinCEN. On September 26, 2002, after Title III of the PATRIOT Act was passed, Treasury Order 180-01 made it an official bureau in the Department of the Treasury. In September 2012, FinCEN's information technology called FinCEN Portal and Query System migrated with 11 years of data into FinCEN Query, a search engine similar to Google. It is a [...] "one stop shop" [...] accessible via the FinCEN Portal allowing broad searches across more fields than before and returning more results.

First, Trump Golf Ltd claimed that the Scottish Minister’s consent under the Electricity Act 1989 section 36 to build a wind farm was ultra vires. Trump Ltd argued Sch 9, para 3 gave rise to a necessary implication that only holders of licences to generate electricity, or <b>exempt</b> <b>persons,</b> could get section 36 consent. This meant the Scottish Ministers were not persons able to give consent, under sections 5 or 6 of the Electricity Act 1989.

But while all seemed to favour Morton, under-currents combined to procure his fall. The Presbyterian clergy were alienated by his leaning to Episcopacy, and all parties in the divided Church disliked his seizure of its estates. Andrew Melville, who had taken over as leader of the Kirk from John Knox, was firmly against any departure from the Presbyterian model, and refused to be won by a place in Morton's household. Morton rigorously pursued the collection of a third of the income from every Church benefice, a revenue that had been allocated to finance the King's household. Morton had discretion to <b>exempt</b> <b>persons</b> and institutions from paying these thirds, and the historian George Hewitt found no striking evidence of bias in Morton's exemptions.|$|R

6000|$|These are {{witnesses}} of {{the combat}} between Henry II. and Thomas à Becket. The Church, as bearing {{the message of}} peace, claimed to be exempt from the sword of the State. Her sacred buildings protected the criminal, the inhabitants of her lands were spared in war, and offences committed either by an ecclesiastic or against one, were not liable to be punished by the temporal power. This protection was extended not only over actually ordained clergymen, but all who held any office in connection with ecclesiastical affairs--all students, nay, all who were clerks enough to read and write. Thus the wild borderers, when made prisoners, escaped the halter by pretending to read a verse of the Miserere, which they had learnt by heart in case of such an emergency, and called their neck-verse; and [...] "without benefit of clergy" [...] was added to new laws, to prevent education from <b>exempting</b> <b>persons</b> from their power.|$|R
