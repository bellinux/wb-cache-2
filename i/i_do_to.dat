25|$|I cannot {{forget that}} ever since I {{was a child}} Fitzwilliam has been, in all situations, my warmest and most affectionate friend, and {{the person in the}} world of whom decidedly I have the best opinion, and so in most respects I have still, but as a {{politician}} I cannot reconcile his conduct with what I (who have known him for more than five-and-thirty years) have always thought to be his character. I think they have all behaved very ill to me, and for most of them, who certainly owe much more to me than <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> them, I feel nothing but contempt, and do not trouble myself about them; but Fitzwilliam is an exception indeed.|$|E

500|$|During {{their time}} in Jacksonville, the McCains' {{marriage}} began to falter. [...] McCain had extramarital affairs; he was seen with other women in social settings and developed a reputation among his colleagues for womanizing. [...] Some of McCain's activity with other women occurred when he was off-duty after routine flights to Marine Corps Air Station Yuma and Naval Air Facility El Centro. [...] McCain later said, [...] "My marriage's collapse was attributable to my own selfishness and immaturity more {{than it was to}} Vietnam, and I cannot escape blame by pointing a finger at the war. The blame was entirely mine."

2500|$|Sheffey enjoyed {{singing and}} {{shouting}} and would often draw pictures {{of birds and}} fish or write snatches of hymns {{on the walls of}} his hosts’ homes or on rock outcroppings, sometimes in artistic lettering.

[...] If it had not been for a rattlesnake they would never have called upon You. [...] Send a rattlesnake to bite Bill, and one to bite John, and send a great big one to bite the old man.” ...|$|E
