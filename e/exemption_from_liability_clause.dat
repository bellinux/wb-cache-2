40|$|This paper {{provides}} an economic {{justification for the}} <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>liability</b> for omissions and for the exceptions to this exemption. It interprets the differential treatment of acts and omissions in tort law {{as a proxy for}} a more fundamental distinction between harms caused by multiple injurers each of whom can single-handedly prevent the harm (either by acting or failing to act) and harms caused by a single injurer (either by acting or failing to act). Since the overall cost to which a group of injurers is exposed is constant, attributing liability to many injurers reduces the part each has to pay and consequently reduces one's incentives to take precautions. The broad <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>liability</b> for omissions is a way of carving a simple, practical rule to distinguish between the typical cases in which an agent can be easily selected and provided with sufficient incentives (typically, cases of acts) and cases {{in which there is a}} serious problem of dilution of liability (typically, cases of omissions). The exceptions to the rule exempting from responsibility for omissions are also explained in terms of efficiency. The imposition of liability for omissions depends on the ability to identify a salient agent, i. e., to single out one or few legally responsible agents and differentiate their role from that of others. Tort law designs three types of "salience rules. " It either creates salience directly (by attributing liability to a single agent), or it can exploit salience created "naturally", or it can induce injurers to create salience voluntarily. ...|$|R

Beginning with the Hague Rules, the various conventions set out to codify and develop the English common law principles by providing a basic set of standards to be met by the carrier; but in practice the level of protection was actually reduced because of new provisions allowing the carrier to (i) limit his liability, and (ii) rely on {{a wide array of}} <b>exemptions</b> <b>from</b> <b>liability</b> (such as [...] "Act of God", [...] "Perils of the Sea" [...] and [...] "negligence in navigation or management of the ship").|$|R

Fibrespinners only required, and could only be granted, <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>liability</b> for any loss or damage caused by unintentional unlawful conduct: that is, for any loss or damage caused by its breach of contract or by negligence on its part or the part of its employees.

50|$|Thus, marine cargo is {{generally}} covered twice by insurance standards. The shipper or cargo-owner {{will be covered}} by a marine insurer likely with 'all risks' cover. The carrier or shipowner will {{be covered by the}} P&I club but will typically limit their liability to goods owners to {{a small fraction of the}} retail value of goods. If the cargo is lost or damaged, the cargo-owner needs to first make a claim against the shipowner. However, the shipowner may avoid liability if it did not cause the loss or if the Hague-Visby Rules grant <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>liability.</b> In that case, the cargo-owner will claim against its own insurance company. If the cargo-owner fails to claim first against the shipowner, but claims instead against its own insurance company, the insurer, having reimbursed its client, will through subrogation pursue the claim in its own right against the shipowner.|$|R

40|$|Can private {{military}} and security personnel {{be tried for}} war crimes {{in the same way}} as 'classical' military personnel acting in armed conflicts? Might they enjoy <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>liability</b> because of their unclear formal status under international humanitarian law? Private {{military and}} security personnel often act in hostile environments and frequently operate alongside state troops. While private military and security companies (PMSCs) usually claim their compliance with international humanitarian law standards, it cannot be excluded that their employees become involved in criminal conduct under the laws of war. Reported violations range from murder of civilians to inhuman treatment and use of warfare methods prohibited under international humanitarian law. To date, however, no private contractor has been sentenced for committing war crimes. This chapter seeks to understand to what extent such 'immunity' might depend on legal conditions, both substantive and procedural, rather than on extra-legal factors.

5000|$|What {{is usually}} meant by {{assumption}} of risk is more precisely termed primary or [...] "express" [...] {{assumption of risk}}. It occurs when the plaintiff has either expressly or implicitly relieved the defendant of the duty to mitigate or relieve the risk causing the injury from which the cause of action arises. It operates as a complete bar to liability {{on the theory that}} upon assumption of the risk, {{there is no longer a}} duty of care running from the defendant to the plaintiff; without a duty owed by the defendant, there can be no negligence on his part. [...] However, primary assumption of risk is not a blanket <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>liability</b> for the operators of a dangerous activity. The specific risk causing the injury must have been known to, and appreciated by, the plaintiff in order for primary assumption of risk to apply. Also, assumption of risk does not absolve a defendant of liability for reckless conduct.|$|R
40|$|It {{is a safe}} {{assumption}} {{that every one of}} the twenty-eight EU Member States has some form of secondary liability principles within its general tort law. Traditionally, tort law principles require an element of deliberate contribution to, and therefore positive knowledge of, another person’s action. They are therefore of limited value for situations like Internet infringement, because the contributor is typically unaware of persons committing concrete acts of infringement. When the contributor merely provides the technical infrastructure that is used by an anonymous crowd for legitimate as well as illegitimate purposes, the “deliberate contribution” or “positive knowledge” element is difficult to prove. The general principles of tort law are not harmonized within Europe. However, regarding Internet services that may be misused for unlawful acts (including, but not limited to, intellectual property infringement), the E-Commerce Directive has created a legal framework for <b>exemptions</b> <b>from</b> <b>liability</b> (the safe harbor). In that regard, the E-Commerce Directive is the European equivalent of the U. S.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we intend to}} {{continue}} {{the analysis of the}} river international contract of carriage of goods on the Danube, in general, and, in particular, to analyze the causes for exoneration <b>from</b> the <b>liability</b> of the Danubian carrier. Objectives: The main objective is to argue how, in the event of damage caused during transport, the carrier is presumed to be at fault, as an effect of triggering the presumption of liability, it may rebut the presumption of juris tantum by contrary evidence, proving that the real cause of the prejudice is not imputable. Prior Work: In the context where also the Romanian and European doctrine analyzes these causes, this paper aims at examining in detail and comparatively their impact, analyzing the legal texts, and also their impact during the trial. Approach: We will consider the exemption circumstances, based on the interpretation of international regulation of the contract of carriage of goods by inland waterways, which we will report in detail. Results: By comparing the two international conventions, we will demonstrate that these causes of removal of liability have a predetermined scope, {{in the sense that they}} affect both contractual relations and in tort liability of the carrier. Values: In the article it was used as a research method the analysis of these incidents laws, with direct interpretation of causes for <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>liability</b> of the Danubian carrier...|$|R

If the <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>liability</b> accorded by the clause were to be construed as being confined to cases in which only the acts and omissions {{of those who were}} identified as the [...] "controlling or directing minds" [...] of the bank were involved, the potential field of operation of the exemption would be so slight as not to have been worth the bank's while to insist on it. This would have left FNB entirely unprotected against <b>liability</b> stemming <b>from</b> the potential negligence or dishonesty of many thousands of employees. The bank, as an artificial, non-human entity, was obviously incapable of being negligent itself in fact. The negligence of the human beings acting as the bank's controlling minds was attributed to the bank; it could also be held vicariously liable for the negligence of ordinary employees acting in the course and within the scope of their employment. When the bank said that it was not liable [...] "whether the loss or damage was due to the bank's negligence or not," [...] it included loss or damage due to the negligence of its employees. Furthermore, the clause provided quite plainly that, even if the loss or damage was due to the bank's own negligence, attributed to it {{as a result of the}} negligence of its controlling minds or its employees, it was still immune <b>from</b> <b>liability.</b>|$|R
40|$|Whatever {{may have}} been the {{position}} historically, any assumption that the bill of lading will normally arrive before the goods themselves, enabling delivery to be made against its production, can no longer be made today. In some trades, it is almost routine for shipowners to deliver without waiting for the bill of lading to catch up. This is a matter of convenience, indeed of commercial necessity. Carriers are not intending to commit any wrong, or deprive anybody of their rightful property. This article looks at the legal protection available to shipowners in this situation, by an exemption or limitation clause in the bill of lading contract. Though sea carriage remains today governed almost universally by the Hague or Hague-Visby regimes, this article also considers the position under the Hamburg Rules, and the recently approved Rotterdam Rules. It also considers clauses written directly into bills of lading by the parties. It is very rare for bills of lading explicitly to exempt or limit liability for delivery without production of an original bill. Normally the shipowner relies on wide but unspecific wording. The courts have been very reluctant to interpret such clauses as applying to delivery without production where <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>liability</b> is claimed. However, limits of liability are treated more kindly, and {{it seems likely that the}} wording of the main international conventions suffices...|$|R

This Note will address a circuit court split on whether a landlord can {{be held liable for}} discrimination under the FHA for withdrawing from the Section 8 voucher program. Section 8 is a government program that provides low-income citizens with vouchers to pay a portion of their rent. Many voucher recipients are minorities or persons with disabilities. The U. S.
