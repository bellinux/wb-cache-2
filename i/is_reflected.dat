5|$|Herschel wedges, {{also called}} Solar Diagonals, are {{effective}} and inexpensive for small telescopes. The sunlight that is {{destined for the}} eyepiece <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> from an unsilvered surface {{of a piece of}} glass. Only a very small fraction of the incident light <b>is</b> <b>reflected.</b> The rest passes through the glass and leaves the instrument. If the glass breaks because of the heat, no light at all <b>is</b> <b>reflected,</b> making the device fail-safe. Simple filters made of darkened glass allow the full intensity of sunlight to pass through if they break, endangering the observer's eyesight. Unfiltered binoculars can deliver hundreds of times as much energy as using the naked eye, possibly causing immediate damage. It is claimed that even brief glances at the midday Sun through an unfiltered telescope can cause permanent damage.|$|E
5|$|Selective mirrors {{to create}} {{interference}} effects are formed of micron-sized bowl-shaped pits lined with {{multiple layers of}} chitin in the wing scales of Papilio palinurus, the emerald swallowtail butterfly. These act as highly selective mirrors for two wavelengths of light. Yellow light <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> directly from the centres of the pits; blue light <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> twice by {{the sides of the}} pits. The combination appears green, but can be seen as an array of yellow spots surrounded by blue circles under a microscope.|$|E
5|$|The {{rarefaction}} <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> off {{the sloping}} end {{wall of the}} clarinet mouthpiece. The opening between the reed and the mouthpiece makes very little difference to {{the reflection of the}} rarefaction wave. This is because the opening is very small compared {{to the size of the}} tube, so almost the entire wave <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> back down the tube even if the reed is completely open at the time the wave hits (image 3).|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} goal of Python's developers {{is making it}} fun to use. This <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> in {{the origin of the}} name, which comes from Monty Python, and in an occasionally playful approach to tutorials and reference materials, such as using examples that refer to spam and eggs instead of the standard foo and bar.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, such {{endorsements}} {{can be said}} {{to undermine}} the principle that a candidate for President should not be beholden to any political formation, which <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> in the requirement for a candidate not {{to be a member of}} any political party.|$|E
5|$|In 1955 Omaha's Union Stockyards overtook Chicago's stockyards as the United States' meat packing center. This legacy <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> in {{the cuisine}} of Omaha, with renowned steakhouses such as Gorat's and the {{recently}} closed Mister C's, {{as well as}} the retail chain Omaha Steaks.|$|E
60|$|Reflexibility of Rays, {{is their}} Disposition to <b>be</b> <b>reflected</b> or turned {{back into the}} same Medium from any other Medium upon whose Surface they fall. And Rays {{are more or less}} reflexible, which are turned back more or less easily. As if Light pass out of a Glass into Air, and by being {{inclined}} more and more to the common Surface of the Glass and Air, begins at length to <b>be</b> totally <b>reflected</b> by that Surface; those sorts of Rays which at like Incidences <b>are</b> <b>reflected</b> most copiously, or by inclining the Rays begin soonest to <b>be</b> totally <b>reflected,</b> <b>are</b> most reflexible.|$|R

5|$|Indium(III) oxide and indium {{tin oxide}} (ITO) are used as a {{transparent}} conductive coating on glass substrates in electroluminescent panels. Indium tin oxide {{is used as a}} light filter in low-pressure sodium-vapor lamps. The infrared radiation <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> back into the lamp, which increases the temperature within the tube and improves the performance of the lamp.|$|E
5|$|Rhee Taekwon-Do {{occupies}} {{a prominent place}} in Australian taekwondo history. This <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> in three key claims: (1) Chong Chul Rhee is the Father of Australian Taekwondo, (2) Rhee Taekwon-Do is the first taekwondo school in Australia, and (3) Rhee Taekwon-Do is the biggest taekwondo school in Australia. The school has widely publicised these claims {{since at least the}} 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Several of {{the islands}} contain pre-historic remains created by {{cultures}} whose names are unknown. They have also {{been affected by the}} successive influences of Celtic, Norse and English-speaking peoples during the historic period and this <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> in their names. The islands also came under attack from Vikings during the early Historic period.|$|E

5|$|The Late Byzantine Period, from 1204 to 1453, has an {{unsettled}} {{chronology of}} buildings, {{especially during the}} Latin Occupation. The fragmentation of the empire, beginning in 1204, <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> in a fragmentation of church design and regional innovations.|$|E
5|$|The {{culture of}} the islands has been {{affected}} by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse and English speaking peoples and this <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> in names given to the islands. Most of the Hebrides have names with Scots Gaelic derivations, whilst those of the Northern Isles tend to be derived from the Viking names. A few have Brythonic, Scots and even perhaps pre-Celtic roots.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasing}} {{popularity of}} hot rodding cars (modifying them to increase performance) <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> {{in part by}} the creation of special-interest magazines catering to this culture. Hot Rod is the oldest such magazine, with first editor Wally Parks, and founded by Robert E. Petersen in 1948, with original publication by his Petersen Publishing Company. Hot Rod has licensed affiliation with Universal Technical Institute.|$|E

5|$|This is Suzuki's forty-third book and, he says, his last. Critics {{have called}} the book candid, sincere, and charming, with {{insightful}} commentary if occasionally flat stories. Suzuki's scientific background <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> in the writing's rational and analytic style.|$|E
5|$|A partial {{recreation}} of the Kowloon Walled City {{exists in}} the Kawasaki Warehouse, an amusement arcade that opened in 2009 in the Japanese suburb of Kawasaki, Kanagawa. The designer's desire to accurately replicate {{the atmosphere of the}} Walled City <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> in the arcade's narrow corridors, electrical wires, pipes, postboxes, sign boards, neon lights, frayed posters, and various other small touches that provide an air of authenticity.|$|E

5|$|Adkins grew up {{in poverty}} {{in the midst of}} the Depression, and his spirited, unusual {{lifestyle}} <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> in his music. His songs, which he began recording and distributing locally in the mid-1950s, explored an affinity for sexual intercourse, and decapitation, and were obscure outside of West Virginia until the 1980s. The newfound popularity secured him a cult following, spawned the Norton Records label, and helped usher in the genre known as psychobilly.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} decline with {{abandoned}} buildings and high elderly populations, {{the demographics of}} Old Louisville began to change noticeably in the 1990s. New residents were not just college students using the area as housing, but also young professionals who {{wanted to live in}} Old Louisville. The Courier-Journal's Velocity weekly has reported the area as a hip, emerging center of culture in Louisville. This change <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> in numerous coffeehouses, restaurants and bars opening in Old Louisville in the 1990s and early 2000s targeting at the younger crowd.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Zagreb and Varaždin, the A4 {{motorway}} runs near {{a number}} of Croatian cities, and connects {{to the rest of}} the Croatian motorway network east of Zagreb. The motorway route was completed in 2008. The motorway's national significance <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> in the positive economic impact on the cities and towns it connects, as well as its importance to tourism in Croatia. The genuine importance of the motorway as a transit route will be demonstrated upon completion of proposed expansion of Port of Rijeka and Rijeka transport node, since the A4 represents an integral part of the RijekaZagrebBudapest transport route.|$|E
