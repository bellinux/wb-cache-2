40|$|In {{this thesis}} church space is {{examined}} {{as a product}} of the material and conceptual interactions between architecture, painting, symbolism and the faithful. In order to study the conditions and factors that shape church space, I undertake a case study that examines the space of the Chora, a Byzantine monastery situated in Istanbul, Turkey, {{as a product of}} the intersection between art, symbolism, and the faithful. The parekklesion of the Chora (1316 - 1321) is explored within the context of its architectural and iconographic design, its symbolic function, and in relation to the way that the faithful experienced their presence within it. In addressing issues related to the experience of church space by the faithful, I problematise a reading of space as γίγνεσθαι – a realm of becoming – and engage with questions that address the involvement of the body – material and conceptual – in the process of producing space and meaning. The concept of church space as an interactional realm of becoming is understood as closely linked to a perception of church as a space in between that unites the human and the divine in a ‘heaven on earth’ and facilitates communication between them. In addressing the complexity of experiencing church space, this study challenges views of space as an <b>empty</b> <b>medium</b> and attempts to establish links between church space as an intermediate domain of becoming and the philosophical concept of chora...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} viscerosomatic {{interaction}} between bladder afferents and somatic nociception we evaluated {{the effect of}} bladder filling on the nociceptive withdrawal reflex (NWR) in 21 healthy subjects. Methods: NWR was evoked in the lower and upper limbs by stimulating the sural and index finger digital nerves, respectively, while simultaneously recording EMG activity in the biceps femoris and biceps brachialis. NWR pain-related perception was quantified on a 10 -point pain scale. Bladder filling was evaluated with suprapubic bladder sonography. Subjects were examined during <b>empty</b> bladder, <b>medium</b> and high level of bladder filling sessions. Results: NWR magnitude in both upper and lower limbs and perceived pain for the upper limb were significantly decreased at higher levels of bladder filling compared to empty bladder sessions. Conclusions: Reduced NWR magnitude in both upper and lower limbs during bladder filling strongly indicates that bladder control and nociception share common modulatory descending pathways. Bladder afferents may activate these pathways to suppress the micturition reflex, but they may also inhibit spinal reflexes to maintain continence during pain stimuli. Significance: The effect of bladder filling on the NWR may represent a useful tool to investigate interactions between the neural pathways controlling the bladder and pain. © 2014 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that radiative transfer effects may explain the unusually high equivalent widths (EWs) of the Lya line, observed occasionally from starburst galaxies, especially at high redshifts. If the dust is locked up inside high-density clouds dispersed in an <b>empty</b> intercloud <b>medium,</b> the Lya photons could scatter off of the surfaces of the clouds, effectively having their journey confined to the dustless medium. The continuum radiation, on the other hand, does not scatter, and would thus be subject to absorption inside the clouds. This scenario is routinely invoked when Lya EWs higher than what is expected theoretically are observed, although the ideal conditions under which the results are derived usually are not considered. Here we systematically examine the relevant physical parameters in this idealized framework, testing whether any astrophysically realistic scenarios may lead to such an effect. It is found that although clumpiness indeed facilitates the escape of Lya, {{it is highly unlikely that}} any real interstellar media should result in a preferential escape of Lya over continuum radiation. Other possible causes are discussed, and it is concluded that the observed high EWs are more likely to be caused by cooling radiation from cold accretion and/or anisotropic escape of the Lya radiation.

40|$|We study {{dynamics}} of filling of an initially <b>empty</b> finite <b>medium</b> by diffusing particles A and B, which arise {{on the surface}} upon dissociation of AB molecules, impinging on it with a fixed flux density I, and desorb from it by the reaction A + B→ AB→ 0. We show that once the bulk diffusivities differ (p=D_A/D_B< 1), there exists a critical flux density I_c(p), above which the relaxation dynamics to the steady state is qualitatively changed: on time dependencies of c_As/c_e (c_e being the steady state concentration at t→∞) a maximum appears, the amplitude of which grows both with I and with D_B/D_A ratio. In the diffusion-controlled limit I ≫ I_c at p ≪ 1 the reaction "selects" the universal laws for the particles number growth N_A= N_B∝ t^ 1 / 4 {{and the evolution of}} the surface concentrations c_As∝ t^- 1 / 4,c_Bs∝ t^ 1 / 4, which are approached by one of the two characteristic regimes with the corresponding hierarchy of the intermediate power-law asymptotics. In the first of these c_As goes through a comparatively sharp max(c_As/c_e) ∝ I^ 1 / 6, the amplitude of which is p-independent, in the second one c_As goes through a -like max(c_As/c_e) ∝ p^- 1 / 4, the amplitude of which is I-independent. We demonstrate that on the main filling stage the evolution of the N(t) / N_e, c_As(t) /c_e, and c_Bs(t) /c_e trajectories with changing p or J between the limiting regimes is unambiguously defined by the value of the scaling parameter K=p^ 3 / 2 J (J being the reduced flux density) and is described by the set of scaling laws, which we study in detail analytically and numerically.

40|$|Background & AimsMesenchymal {{stem cell}} (MSC) {{transplantation}} {{was shown to}} be effective {{for the treatment of}} liver fibrosis, but the mechanisms of action are not yet fully understood. We transplanted encapsulated human MSCs in two mouse models of liver fibrosis to determine the mechanisms behind the protective effect. MethodsHuman bone marrow-derived MSCs were microencapsulated in novel alginate-polyethylene glycol microspheres. In vitro, we analyzed the effect of MSC-conditioned medium on the activation of hepatic stellate cells and the viability, proliferation, cytokine secretion, and differentiation capacity of encapsulated MSCs. The level of fibrosis induced by bile duct ligation (BDL) or carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) was assessed after intraperitoneal transplantation of encapsulated MSCs, encapsulated human fibroblasts, and <b>empty</b> microspheres. ResultsMSC-conditioned <b>medium</b> inhibited hepatic stellate cell activation and release of MSC secreted anti-apoptotic (IL- 6, IGFBP- 2) and anti-inflammatory (IL- 1 Ra) cytokines. Viability, proliferation, and cytokine secretion of microencapsulated MSCs were similar to those of non-encapsulated MSCs. Within the microspheres, MSCs maintained their capacity to differentiate into adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteocytes. 23 % (5 / 22) of the MSC clones were able to produce anti-inflammatory IL- 1 Ra in vitro. Microencapsulated MSCs significantly delayed the development of BDL- and CCl 4 -induced liver fibrosis. Fibroblasts had an intermediate effect against CCl 4 -induced fibrosis. Mice transplanted with encapsulated MSCs showed lower mRNA levels of collagen type I, whereas levels of matrix metalloproteinase 9 were significantly higher. Human IL- 1 Ra was detected in the serum of 36 % (4 / 11) of the mice transplanted with microencapsulated MSCs.

40|$|Intraperitoneal {{transplantation}} of alginate-microencapsulated human hepatocytes is {{an attractive}} option {{for the management of}} acute liver failure (ALF) providing short-term support to allow native liver regeneration. The main aim {{of this study was to}} establish an optimised protocol for production of alginate-encapsulated human hepatocytes and evaluate their suitability for clinical use. Human hepatocyte microbeads (HMBs) were prepared using sterile GMP grade materials. We determined physical stability, cell viability, and hepatocyte metabolic function of HMBs using different polymerisation times and cell densities. The immune activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after co-culture with HMBs was studied. Rats with ALF induced by galactosamine were transplanted intraperitoneally with rat hepatocyte microbeads (RMBs) produced using a similar optimised protocol. Survival rate and biochemical profiles were determined. Retrieved microbeads were evaluated for morphology and functionality. The optimised HMBs were of uniform size (583. 5 ± 3. 3 µm) and mechanically stable using 15 min polymerisation time compared to 10 min and 20 min (p< 0. 001). 3 D confocal microscopy images demonstrated that hepatocytes with similar cell viability were evenly distributed within HMBs. Cell density of 3. 5 × 10 (6) cells/ml provided the highest viability. HMBs incubated in human ascitic fluid showed better cell viability and function than controls. There was no significant activation of PBMCs co-cultured with empty or hepatocyte microbeads, compared to PBMCs alone. Intraperitoneal transplantation of RMBs was safe and significantly improved the severity of liver damage compared to control groups (<b>empty</b> microbeads and <b>medium</b> alone; p< 0. 01). Retrieved RMBs were intact and free of immune cell adherence and contained viable hepatocytes with preserved function. An optimised protocol to produce GMP grade alginate-encapsulated human hepatocytes has been established. Transplantation of microbeads provided effective metabolic function in ALF. These high quality HMBs should be suitable for use in clinical transplantation...|$|R
40|$|Previously [Inesi & de Meis (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 5929 - 5936] it {{was shown}} that {{dimethyl}} sulphoxide (Me 2 SO) increases the amount of Ca 2 + accumulated by sarcoplasmic-reticulum vesicles. This effect was related to {{a decrease in the}} enzyme affinity for ADP from less than 20 microM to 1 mM. In the present work the apparent affinity of the ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme for ADP was determined by measuring the rate of ATP synthesis in vesicles previously loaded with Ca 2 +, at different pH values and in the presence and absence of Me 2 SO (20 %, v/v) and KCl. In all conditions tested, addition of Me 2 SO never promoted an increase of the apparent Km for ADP to a value higher than 25 microM. ADP inhibits the phosphorylation of the enzyme by Pi. Two components, with Ki values of 80 microM and 8 mM, were detected when vesicles previously loaded with Ca 2 + were used. The high-affinity component (Ki 80 microM) was abolished after addition of Me 2 SO to the <b>medium.</b> <b>Empty</b> vesicles, on the other hand, exhibited only the low-affinity component (Ki 8 mM). During ATP synthesis in a totally aqueous medium, there was a decrease in the phosphoenzyme formed by Pi, after addition of 80 - 100 microM-ADP to the medium. In the presence of Me 2 SO this decrease was smaller. The sum of the fractions of phosphoenzyme formed by ATP and by Pi during Ca 2 + uptake was higher in the presence of Me 2 SO than in a totally aqueous medium. Me 2 SO decreased the passive efflux of Ca 2 + measured in the presence of 0. 1 mM-Pi and 0. 1 mM-MgCl 2. In a totally aqueous medium the same decrease was observed when Pi and MgCl 2 concentrations were raised to 4 mM. These data suggest that ADP binds to two different enzyme conformations. The binding to one of these conformations (*E) inhibits the phosphorylation of the enzyme by Pi, increases the efflux of Ca 2 + and decreases the amount of Ca 2 + accumulated by the vesicles...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Since Sutherland {{developed}} the multicellular tumor spheroid (MTS) model {{to mimic the}} 3 D-structure of small size solid tumors (R. Sutherland et al., 1970), MTS {{have been found to}} be useful in several aspects of tumor biology, including studies in the field of radiation biology and photodynamic therapy (PDT). Cellular organization of MTS allows to imitate in vivo small size tumors much better than 2 D in vitro models (G. Hamilton, 1998). MTS were demonstrated to represent quite realistically the 3 D growth and organization of solid tumors, and consequently to simulate well the cell-cell interactions and microenvironmental conditions found in tumor tissue. This similarities to a tumor xenograft let us apply MTS as a more rapid and valid in vitro model for anticancer drug screening compared to a monolayer culture. MTS could be formed from monolayer tumor cells grown by various in vitro classical methods, such as liquid-overlay, spinner flask and gyratory rotation systems. At the same time all classical methods are time consuming and can not provide the production of MTS with narrow spheroid size distribution within a range of 300 – 900 µm. More over, some tumor cells cannot form spheroids in suspension. The method proposed by Markvicheva et al. (Markvicheva et al., 2003) for microencapsulated MTS production provides several advantages over all classical techniques, such as generation of significant spheroid quantities, production of MTS of desired sizes, generation of MTS based on tumor and non-tumor cells which normally can't form aggregates in suspension culture. The objective of this research was to estimate the response of a novel in vitro model based on encapsulated MTS to PDT. Chlorine e 6 was chosen as a model photosensitizer. Materials and Methods Chemicals: Sodium alginate (medium viscosity), EDTA and CaCl 2 were from Sigma. All solutions for cell immobilization were prepared using 0. 9 % NaCl. Oligochitosan (MM 3500 Da, DD 98 %) was kindly provided by Prof. A. Bartkowiak (Poland). Chlorine e 6 (Ce 6) was supplied by Porphyrin Products (Logan, UT, USA). Ce 6 stock solution (2 mM) was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at - 20 oC. Before being added into the cell cultures, Ce 6 was further diluted in the culture medium. All solutions for cell immobilization were prepared using 0. 9 % NaCl. Cells and cell cultivation media: In our study MCF- 7 human adenocarcinoma cell line was used. The cells were cultured as a monolayer in DMEM medium supplemented with 10 mg/l human insulin, 10 % fetal calf serum (FCS) BioClot at 370 C in a 5 % CO 2 humidified atmosphere and were reseeded into fresh medium every 2 - 3 days. Bioencapsulation of tumor cells in microcapsules: Cell precipitate (107 cells), obtained by trypsinization of monolayer culture was mixed with 2 ml of a sterilized sodium alginate solution, and the mixture was extruded using an electrostatic bead generator into 0. 5 % CaCl 2 by peristaltic pump. The obtained hydrogel microbeads were incubated with 0. 2 % oligochitosan solution for 10 min, in order to form alginate-oligochitosan membrane on microbeads surface. Then microbeads were washed 3 times with physiological saline. In order to get hollow microcapsules, the microbeads were incubated in 50 mM EDTA solution for 10 min and they were again washed and transferred into cultivation <b>medium.</b> <b>Empty</b> microcapsules were prepared as mentioned above. Cultivation of bioencapsulated cells to generate MTS: The resulted alginate-oligochitosan microcapsules with MCF- 7 cells were cultivated in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 % FBS in 150 cm 2 (Corning Inc.) flasks at 370 C in 5 % CO 2 for 2 - 4 weeks until MTS were formed. Ce 6 non-specific adsorption on microcapsule surface: Microcapsules were incubated in Ce 6 solution in the darkness at various final Ce 6 concentrations for 24 h. Then supernatants and microcapsules were washed in the physiological solution, and were analysed using a computer-controlled luminescence spectrofluorimetre (Perkin-Elmer LS 50 B). The excitation wavelength was 410 nm, and spectra were collected at emission wavelength ranged between 600 – 800 nm. Ce 6 solution in the same conditions but without microcapsules was used as a control. Ce 6 cytotoxicity: Encapsulated MTS (100 µl) were incubated with Ce 6 (0 - 34 nM) in 24 -well plates for 24 h. Each well contained 0. 5 ml of RPMI medium supplemented with 2 % FBS. Cell viability was measured using MTT-assay. MCF- 7 cells growing in monolayer were used as control. The cytotoxicity was expressed in the form of the viability using the following formula: Viability (%) = (Viable cells concentration in experiment / Viable cells concentration in control) x 100. Every experiment was repeated three times. Ce 6 photoxicity: Encapsulated MTS (100 µl) were incubated with Ce 6 (8. 4 nM) in 24 -well plates for 24 h. Then MTS were washed with PBS 3 times, and 0. 5 ml of RPMI was added in each well. The cells were irradiated by 650 nm diode laser (Coherent, France). Light energy densities were 0. 5 – 70 J cm- 2 at power density 30 mW cm- 2. The cell viability was measured using MTT-assay in 24 h after irradiation. To study the structure of MTS before and after irradiation at various Ce 6 concentrations, a set of MTS samples was selected. The samples were fixed in a 2 % (w/v) formaldehyde solution and embedded to the paraffin to prepare thin sectioned on slides. Results and Discussion Cell encapsulation was carried out using a special device, namely an electrostatic bead generator. The best calcium-alginate microbeads with a narrow bead size distribution (within the range of 300 – 600 µm, a mean size 340 ± 40 µm) were prepared using the voltage of 7. 8 kV (Tabl. 1). At the same time alginate-oligochitosan microcapsules mean diameter was much bigger (608 ± 50 µm) that that one of microbeads (Fig. 1). In order to understand the Ce 6 non-specific adsorption on microcapsule surface, microcapsules were incubated with Ce 6 solution for 24 h. The non-specific Ce 6 sorption by empty microcapsules was 30 nmol per 1 ml of microcapsule slurry. Therefore the Ce 6 sorption on the microcapsule surface could be ignored, and there was no necessity to remove the microcapsule membrane at photodynamic treatment of encapsulated MTS. To get MTS model, tumor cells (MCF- 7) were microencapsulated and cultivated in 150 ml T-flasks in a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere at 37 oC for 2 – 4 weeks. The cell proliferation has been easily observed by light microscope (Leitz, Germany). The cells grew in aggregates which have been increasing in their sizes with the cultivation time. The cell concentration in obtained encapsulated MTS was 5 x 106 cells/ml slurry. The cytotoxicity of Ce 6 was estimated as an inhibition rate in cell viability. The cytotoxicity increased with increasing photosensitizer concentration in both encapsulated MTS and monolayer culture, but the viability of encapsulated MTS was higher than that one in monolayer culture (Fig. 2). Results obtained for MCF- 7 monolayer were in agreement with data previously reported (JL. Merlin et al., 2003). Maximal non-toxic concentrations were 8. 4 µM and 1. 7 µM for encapsulated spheroids and for monolayer culture, respectively. These results revealed that the difference between monolayer culture and MTS was rather remarkable even for these previous experiments. These two concentrations were chosen for the next experiments. Parameter Value Voltage (Electrostatic bead generator) 7. 8 kV Flow rate(peristaltic pump) 0. 5 ml/min Tube diameter(peristaltic pump) 1. 3 mm Needle diameter 0. 3 mm Sodium alginate solution concentration 1. 3 % (w/v) Table 1 : Optimized conditions for microcapsule preparation technique using an electrostatic bead generator. Figure 1 : Microcapsule size distribution in RPMI medium (a mean diameter is 608 ± 50 µm; a membrane thickness is 70 ± 5 µm). Figure 2 : Cell viability in monolayer model (▲) and MTS model (▄) after incubation with Ce 6 for 24 h. Figure 3 : Cell viability in monolayer model (▲) and MTS model (▄) 24 h after PDT at light energy densities 1 - 70 J cm- 2 As can be seen in Fig. 3, phototoxicity increased with light energy density enhance both for spheroids and monolayer culture. However, the cell viability of the encapsulated MTS was higher than that one of monolayer culture, in spite of the fifth-fold Ce 6 concentration taken for MTS. For instance, a percentage of viable cells in MTS was tree times bigger compared to monolayer culture at light energy density 10 J cm- 2. Conclusions Biocompatible polyelectrolyte microcapsules were used to generate MCF- 7 cell based encapsulated MTS. Our results demonstrated that the proposed MTS model was much more resistant to the photodynamic treatment than monolayer model. We concluded that the encapsulated MTS model could mimic small size solid tumors more precisely, than commonly used classical monolayer model.
