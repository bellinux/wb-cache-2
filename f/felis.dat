5|$|The {{domestic}} cat {{was first}} classified as <b>Felis</b> catus by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th {{edition of his}} Systema Naturae published in 1758. Because of modern phylogenetics, domestic cats are usually regarded as another subspecies of the wildcat, F. silvestris. This has resulted in mixed usage of the terms, as the domestic cat can be called by its subspecies name, <b>Felis</b> silvestris catus. Wildcats have also {{been referred to as}} various subspecies of F. catus, but in 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature fixed the name for wildcats as F. silvestris. The most common name in use for the domestic cat remains F. catus. Sometimes, the domestic cat has been called <b>Felis</b> domesticus as proposed by German naturalist J.C.P. Erxleben in 1777, but these are not valid taxonomic names and have been used only rarely in scientific literature. A population of Transcaucasian black feral cats was once classified as <b>Felis</b> daemon (Satunin 1904) but now this population {{is considered to be a}} part of domestic cat.|$|E
5|$|The felids are {{a rapidly}} {{evolving}} family of mammals that {{share a common}} ancestor only 10–15million years ago and include lions, tigers, cougars and many others. Within this family, domestic cats (<b>Felis</b> catus) {{are part of the}} genus <b>Felis,</b> which is a group of small cats containing about seven species (depending upon classification scheme). Members of the genus are found worldwide and include the jungle cat (<b>Felis</b> chaus) of southeast Asia, European wildcat (F. silvestris silvestris), African wildcat (F. s. lybica), the Chinese mountain cat (F. bieti), and the Arabian sand cat (F. margarita), among others.|$|E

40|$|The early {{distinction}} between prerenal azotemia, {{characterized by an}} avid proximal tubular sodium reabsorption, and ATN, in which proximal tubule function is depressed, remains an important but difficult clinical task. Indices of acute renal failure based on urinary sodium excretion may be helpful but have several limitations, among which {{is the use of}} diuretics. The effectiveness of the fractional excretion of uric acid (FEUA) and that of endogenous lithium (<b>FELi)</b> in the diagnosis of acute renal failure has been evaluated in an unselected group of 46 patients, 28 with prerenal azotemia and 18 with ATN. In the entire group, <b>FELi</b> concurred with the clinical diagnosis in 78 % of the patients, whereas the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) and FEUA were in agreement in only 63 and 50 %, respectively. <b>FELi</b> was more sensitive to identify hemodynamic renal failure, because 93 % of prerenal failure patients had a low <b>FELi,</b> contrasting with a low FEUA in only 68 % and a low FENa in 75 %. The major reason for the discrepancy between FENa and <b>FELi</b> was the administration of diuretics. In both acute renal failure groups, FENa was higher in the subgroups receiving diuretics. In contrast, diuretic therapy had no effect on <b>FELi</b> in either group. These results suggest that <b>FELi</b> is more accurate than either FENa or FEUA for distinguishing prerenal azotemia from ATN. The superiority of <b>FELi</b> appears especially relevant in patients treated with the usual diuretics...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to analyze whether {{the mechanism of}} decreased fractional lithium excretion (<b>FELi)</b> induced in humans by the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor indomethacin and the vasopressin analog desamino- 8 -D-arginine vasopressin (d-DAVP) is amiloride inhibitable. Eight sodium-restricted (10 mmol/day) healthy volunteers underwent clearance studies to evaluate the effects of indomethacin (50 mg tid for 6 days), amiloride (10 mg twice before the clearance study) and d-DAVP (4 micrograms, i. v.), and combinations of these drugs. Despite the sodium restriction, amiloride {{had no effect on}} <b>FELi,</b> although the dosage was sufficient to cause a 6 -fold increase in sodium excretion, and potassium retention. Compared to a base-line value of 27. 9 +/- 2. 1 %, <b>FELi</b> fell to 20. 7 +/- 2. 1 % after indomethacin (P <. 01) and to 22. 4 +/- 1. 5 % after d-DAVP (P <. 01). When d-DAVP was administered during indomethacin, the <b>FELi</b> fell to 18. 0 +/- 1. 4 %. Compared to indomethacin alone, this represented no significant further change. Amiloride did not prevent the fall in <b>FELi</b> caused by indomethacin or d-DAVP or both. These data indicate that in humans, 1) sodium restriction does not cause amiloride-sensitive lithium reabsorption, and 2) the lithium reabsorption caused by d-DAVP and indomethacin is not amiloride sensitiv...|$|R

40|$|Increased {{reabsorption}} {{of sodium}} (Na) in the proximal {{segments of the}} nephron is present in hypertensive patients. Studies performed in men reported an association between proximal Na reabsorption and features of the metabolic syndrome. This study explores the relationship between metabolic variables and proximal Na reabsorption in healthy women. This study is population-based and cross-sectional examining 661 healthy women aged 40 - 75 y. After 15 minutes rest, blood pressure was measured 3 times, blood was drawn and urine was collected. Fractional excretion of endogenous lithium (<b>FELi)</b> {{was used as an}} indirect marker of proximal sodium reabsorption, lithium being only reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. All women receiving blood pressure, blood glucose or lipid lowering therapy were excluded. Correlations: <b>FELi</b> was positively correlated with the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa, r= 0. 3, p< 0. 001). <b>FELi</b> was negatively associated with total cholesterol (r=- 0. 14, P< 0. 0001), LDL-cholesterol (r=- 0. 16, P< 0. 0001), BMI (r=- 0. 08, P< 0. 05) and weight (r=- 0. 09, P< 0. 05). Menopausal status or a family history of hypertension did not affect the associations. Simple linear regression analysis: age, waist circumference, waist/hip ratio, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, Hdl cholesterol, triglycerides, serum uric acid or a family history of hypertension were not significant predictors of <b>FELi.</b> BMI was a significant predictor but the strongest relationships were found between <b>FELi</b> and total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and FENa. Multivariate linear regression model: When significant predictors of <b>FELi</b> were examined in a multivariate linear regression model also controlling for age, weight, systolic blood pressure and FENa, total cholesterol (p= 0. 003) or LDL-cholesterol (p= 0. 001) significantly and independently predicted <b>FELi.</b> In conclusion, these data suggest that metabolic parameters, in particular total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol {{and to a lesser extent}} weight and BMI, are associated with increased proximal Na reabsorption in a healthy untreated women population. Considering the possible link between increased reabsorption of sodium and the development of hypertension, a major cardiovascular risk factor, this association may provide an additional hypothesis for the increased cardiovascular risk of subjects with the metabolic syndrom...|$|R
5|$|The {{jungle cat}} (<b>Felis</b> chaus), {{also called the}} reed cat or swamp cat, is a {{medium-sized}} cat native to the Middle East, South and Southeast Asia and southern China. It {{is a member of}} the genus <b>Felis</b> and was first described by Johann Anton Güldenstädt in 1776. Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber gave the jungle cat its present binomial name and is therefore generally considered as binomial authority. Ten subspecies are recognised at present.|$|E
5|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} of the serval {{have remained in}} dispute; in 1997, palaeontologists M.C. McKenna and S.K. Bell classified Leptailurus as a subgenus of <b>Felis,</b> while others like O.R.P. Bininda-Edmonds (of the Technical University of Munich) have grouped it with <b>Felis,</b> Lynx and Caracal. Studies in the 2000s and the 2010s show that the serval, along with the caracal and the African golden cat, forms {{one of the eight}} lineages of Felidae. According to a 2006 genetic study, the Caracal lineage came into existence 8.5mya, and the ancestor of this lineage arrived in Africa 8.5–5.6mya.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the contribution of renal sodium handling by the proximal tubule as an independent determinant of blood pressure responsiveness to salt in hypertension. We measured blood pressure (BP), renal hemodynamics, and segmental renal sodium handling (with lithium used as a marker of proximal sodium reabsorption) in 38 hypertensive patients and 27 normotensive subjects (15 young and 12 age-matched) on a high and low sodium diet. In control subjects, changing the diet from a low to a high sodium content resulted in no change in BP and increases in glomerular filtration rate (P< 0. 05), renal plasma flow (P< 0. 05), and fractional excretion of lithium (<b>FE(Li),</b> P< 0. 01). In hypertensive patients, comparable variations of sodium intake induced an increase in BP with no change in renal hemodynamics and proximal sodium reabsorption. When analyzed by tertiles of their BP response to salt, salt-insensitive hypertensive patients of the first tertile disclosed a pattern of adaptation of proximal sodium reabsorption comparable to that of control subjects, whereas the most salt-sensitive patients of the third tertile had an inverse pattern with a high <b>FE(Li)</b> on low salt and a lower <b>FE(Li)</b> on high salt, suggesting an inappropriate modulation of proximal sodium reabsorption. The BP response to salt correlated positively with age (r= 0. 34, P= 0. 036) and negatively with the changes in <b>FE(Li)</b> (r=- 0. 37, P= 0. 029). In a multivariate analysis, the changes in <b>FE(Li)</b> were significantly and independently associated with the salt-induced changes in BP. These results suggest that proximal sodium reabsorption is an independent determinant of the BP response to salt in hypertension...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{reduction}} of hexavalent chromium species in aqueous olutions by interaction with <b>Fe(lI)</b> -bearing solid surfaces was studied using a 0. 96 • l 0 3 M Cr(VI) solution and iron-rich clays with different <b>Fe(lI)</b> /Fe(III) ratios, layer charge, and exchange properties, i. e., chlorite, corrensite, and montmorillonite. Experimental studies demonstrated that <b>Fe(lI)</b> -bearing phyllosilicates reduce aqueous Cr(VI) ions at acidic pH. Chlorite and corrensite, {{owing to the}} high Fe(II) /Fe(III) ratio, are electrochemically reactive, as rapid Cr(VI) reduction indicated. In contrast, montmorillonite showed minimum to nil reactivity towards Cr(VI). Furthermore, corrensite, which is high in both Fe(II) ~'e(III) ratio and exchange capacity, adsorbs {{the greatest amount of}} chromium. X-ray absorption spectroscopy at A 1, Mg, Fe, and Cr K-edges was used to investigate the adsorbed chromium species. The montmorillonite sample, unaffected by treatment with Cr(VI) solution, displays no change at any investigated edge. Edge shape and energy also do not change for the Mg and A 1 spectra in corrensite, and changes are minor in chlorite. By contrast, the Fe K-edge changes both in chlorite and corrensite, and indicates an increase of Fe(III) in treated samples at the expense of pre-existing Fe(II).

40|$|International audienceThe {{population}} {{decay of}} light-induced small polarons in iron-doped lithium niobate is simulated by a Monte-Carlo method {{on the basis}} of Holstein's theory. The model considers random walks of both bound polarons (NbLi 4 +) and free polarons (NbNb 4 +) ending to deep traps (<b>FeLi</b> 3 +). The thermokinetic interplay between polaron species is introduced by trapping and de-trapping rates at niobium antisites (NbLi). The decay of the NbLi 4 + population proceeds by three possible channels: direct trapping at <b>FeLi</b> 3 + sites, hopping on niobium antisites and hopping on Nb regular sites after conversion to the free state. Up to three regimes, each one reflecting the predominance of one of these processes, appear with different activation energies in the Arrhenius plots of the decay time. The influence of <b>FeLi</b> and NbLi concentrations on the transition temperatures is evidenced. For both polaron species, the length of the final hop (trapping length) is found much larger than the usual hopping length and decreases at rising temperature. This trap size effect is a natural consequence of Holstein's theory and may explain some unclear features of polaron-related light-induced phenomena, such as the temperature-dependent stretching exponent of light-induced absorption decays and the anomalous increase of the photoconductivity at high doping levels...|$|R
40|$|Renal tubular sodium {{handling}} {{was investigated}} prospectively in 48 normotensive subjects, 53 untreated hypertensive patients, and 13 patients with white coat hypertension using endogenous trace lithium {{as a marker}} of proximal sodium reabsorption. A 12 -hour daytime ambulatory blood pressure recording was performed in all patients to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension. Patients {{were included in the}} white coat hypertension group if their office blood pressure was above 160 / 90 mm Hg but the mean value of their 12 -hour ambulatory recording was lower than 140 / 90 mm Hg. All participants were studied on their normal diet and ate salt freely. Fractional excretions of sodium (FENa), lithium (<b>FELi),</b> and potassium (FEK) were measured simultaneously before blood pressure recording. FENa was significantly higher in hypertensive patients (0. 84 +/- 0. 05 %, P <. 05) than in normotensive control subjects (0. 60 +/- 0. 06 %), and <b>FELi</b> was comparable in the two groups (15. 4 +/- 0. 65 % in hypertensive patients and 17. 0 +/- 0. 9 % in control subjects). However, the relation between FENa and <b>FELi</b> was significantly different in normotensive subjects and hypertensive patients (P <. 001), so that for a given increase in FENa a smaller increase in <b>FELi</b> was observed in hypertensive patients. In addition, the ratios of urinary lithium to sodium and urinary potassium to sodium were significantly reduced in hypertensive patients, suggesting an increased proximal reabsorption of sodium. Similar alterations in renal tubular sodium handling were observed in patients with white coat hypertension. These results suggest that an increased sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule may contribute to the maintenance of hypertension and that white coat hypertension might represent a prehypertensive state...|$|R
