40|$|Tarski {{initiated}} a logic-based approach to formal geometry that studies first-order structures with a ternary betweenness relation (beta) and a quaternary equidistance relation (equiv). Tarski established, inter alia, that the first-order (FO) theory of (R^ 2,beta,equiv) is decidable. Aiello and van Benthem (2002) conjectured that the FO-theory <b>of</b> <b>expansions</b> <b>of</b> (R^ 2,beta) with unary predicates is decidable. We refute this conjecture {{by showing that}} for all n > 1, the FO-theory <b>of</b> monadic <b>expansions</b> <b>of</b> (R^n,beta) is Pi^ 1 _ 1 -hard and therefore not even arithmetical. We also define a natural and comprehensive class C of geometric structures (T,beta), where T is a subset of R^n, and show that for each structure (T,beta) in C, the FO-theory of the class <b>of</b> monadic <b>expansions</b> <b>of</b> (T,beta) is undecidable. We then consider classes <b>of</b> <b>expansions</b> <b>of</b> structures (T,beta) with restricted unary predicates, for example finite predicates, and establish a variety of related undecidability results. In addition to decidability questions, we briefly study the expressivity of universal MSO and weak universal MSO over <b>expansions</b> <b>of</b> (R^n,beta). While the logics are incomparable in general, over <b>expansions</b> <b>of</b> (R^n,beta), formulae of weak universal MSO translate into equivalent formulae of universal MSO.
