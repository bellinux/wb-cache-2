500|$|French filmmaker Robert Bresson {{admired the}} film. [...] "It {{filled me with}} wonder because of its cinematographic writing... <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> seen it twice {{in a row and}} again the next day, I would have done." [...] Elsewhere Bresson said he also loved the film's ski chase.|$|E
500|$|West {{was also}} {{regarded}} for his extreme mental toughness and his exemplary work ethic. The NBA described West as [...] "obsessive perfectionism, unabashed confidence, and an uncompromising will to win… {{a level of}} intensity so high it could melt lead". Lakers broadcaster Chick Hearn once said: [...] "He took a loss harder than any player I've ever known. He would sit by himself and stare into space. A loss just ripped his guts out." [...] Even before his sole championship in 1972, the Lakers held a [...] "Jerry West Night", and eleven-time NBA champion and perennial rival Bill Russell appeared and said: [...] "Jerry, you are, {{in every sense of}} the word, truly a champion… <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> one wish granted, it would be that you would always be happy." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} scene {{featuring}} Sandor [...] "the Hound" [...] Clegane, comedian Steve Love was cast {{as one of the}} Brotherhood members killed by the Hound. Love previously had become known for his impressions of various Game of Thrones characters, uploading the video to YouTube, which ultimately resulted in his appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Following the appearance, Love stated that he had received an email from Benioff offering him a part in the show, saying [...] "I broached the subject by sending them an email back saying 'Listen I don't know what your plans are for me but it would really mean a lot to me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> one of those trademark Game of Thrones gruesome death scenes, and they wrote back saying 'Actually Steve, that was exactly what we had in mind for you.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Despite {{achieving}} distinction {{at a young}} age, Clinkscales soon {{fell out}} of the public view. He spent one year in Springfield Gardens High School in Queens and did not play basketball for the team due to poor grades. When considering his failure to develop his potential at an early stage, he reflected: [...] "All [...] would have come true <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> stayed in New York and played high school basketball." [...] In the following year, he transferred to Shores Christian Academy in Ocala, Florida. The decision to switch schools was made because he wanted to improve his academic performance, and one of his friends knew the new school's basketball coach, Allan Adams. At Ocala, Clinkscales lived with Stephen and Nancy Davidson, who both worked at the academy. Stephen was a pastor and the administrator of the school, and Nancy was an office staff member.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of his debut, the Philadelphia club {{retained}} several talented pitchers, including Eddie Plank, Chief Bender, and Jack Coombs. Coveleski admitted that he [...] " [...] know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> beat them out for a spot in the rotation." [...] After the 1914 season, the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League wanted Coveleski, and traded five players to Spokane to acquire him. While Connie Mack had an agreement with Spokane that Coveleski would be promoted after playing there for a time, the Athletics fell under new ownership in 1913 and lost control of him due to the Athletics' rights expiring. Coveleski spent his time in Portland learning to throw the spitball; originally using chewing tobacco, he later used alum. In his lone season with Portland, he won and lost 17 games, and had a 2.67 ERA. After the season ended, the Cleveland Indians purchased Coveleski from Portland, and he joined the major league squad in 1916.|$|E
500|$|In December 2011, Jenkins {{exited the}} project, citing [...] "creative differences". She stated, [...] "I {{have had a}} great time working at Marvel. We parted on very good terms, and I look forward to working with them again." [...] Jenkins felt she could not have made a good film [...] "out of Thor 2 because I wasn’t the right director... I could have made a great Thor <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> done the story that I was wanting to do. But I don’t think I was the right person to make a great Thor out of the story they wanted to do." [...] Jenkins had {{intended}} to create a film based on the premise of Romeo and Juliet, where Jane was stuck on Earth with Thor forbidden to come save her. After Thor eventually does travel to Earth, he and Jane would have discovered that Malekith was [...] "hiding the dark energy inside of Earth because he knows that Odin doesn't care about Earth, and so he's using Odin's disinterest in Earth to trick him." ...|$|E

It sounded so far away and lovely. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>'ave</b> met the man that played that organ, I'd have kissed him. D'you {{think he did it}} on purpose? ...|$|R
500|$|... "This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like" [...] was {{released}} digitally through the United States iTunes Store on March 29, 2011. Following {{the release of}} Porcelain Black's second single, [...] "Naughty Naughty," [...] Dutch DJ, remixer and house music producer R3hab produced a remix of [...] "This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like," [...] making it available for free download through SoundCloud on January 24, 2012. R3hab went on to compliment Porcelain Black's original song, stating, [...] "The original vibe is crazy, and I am {{a big fan of}} Lil Wayne. This track makes you wanna rage like the lyrics say! I see [...] as a rollercoaster ride. Breaks slow it down. Then there is a climb, and the big drop!" [...] Porcelain Black complimented R3hab's remix in an interview with MTV News: [...] "I wish his remixes were the official singles because they really pop off next level. I love all the spooky horror pop synths he throws in the mixes, and the breakdowns make me wanna throw back shots of whiskey and hair whip. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> sex with a song I'd def be tappin’ dat remix!" ...|$|E
500|$|He {{was very}} careful not to present his own views of the meaning of his films and leave them open to interpretation. He {{explained}} in a 1960 interview with Robert Emmett Ginna: [...] "One of the things I always find extremely difficult, when a picture's finished, is when a writer or a film reviewer asks, 'Now, {{what is it that you}} were trying to say in that picture?' And without being thought too presumptuous for using this analogy, I like to remember what T. S. Eliot said to someone who had asked him—I believe it was The Waste Land—what he meant by the poem. He replied, 'I meant what I said'. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> said it any differently, I would have". Kubrick likened the understanding of his films to popular music, in that whatever the background or intellect of the individual, a Beatles record, for instance, can both be appreciated by the Alabama truck driver and the young Cambridge intellectual in the way that his films can because their [...] "emotions and subconscious are far more similar than their intellects". He believed that the subconscious emotional reaction evoked by audiences was far more powerful in the film medium than in any other traditional verbal form, and was one of the reasons why he often relied on long periods in his films without dialogue, placing emphasis on images and sound. In a Time magazine interview in 1975, Kubrick further stated: [...] "The essence of a dramatic form is to let an idea come over people without it being plainly stated. When you say something directly, it is simply not as potent as it is when you allow people to discover it for themselves." [...] He also said [...] "Realism is probably the best way to dramatize argument and ideas. Fantasy may deal best with themes which lie primarily in the unconscious".|$|E
2500|$|He {{attended}} Silverdale School, and was {{enthusiastic about}} football, later reflecting, [...] "I'd have probably preferred to be a footballer <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been good enough. But my knees {{would never have}} lasted." [...] Despite his many commitments, {{he has been a}} regular supporter of Sheffield Wednesday.|$|E

2500|$|After the Appeals court ruling, Dell'Utri {{expressed}} {{his admiration for}} the late Vittorio Mangano, a convicted Mafioso who up to his death in prison denied that any link existed between Cosa Nostra and Dell'Utri and Berlusconi. [...] "He was a sick inmate who was asked to testify against me and Berlusconi and always refused to do so. If he had, anything {{he would have said}} would have been believed. But he preferred to stay in prison, and die there, rather than to make unjust accusations," [...] Dell'Utri said. [...] "He was my hero. I don't know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> resisted as much as he did." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following Button's fourth-place finish, {{which was}} the fifth time in the season that he {{finished}} in the top four, he stated he did not compete to attempt to prove anything but was in the sport [...] "to do my job and my job is to do the best job I can for myself and for the team and that's exactly what I did." [...] However, he was delighted at his battle with the Williams team, saying, [...] "It was a lot of fun. And then the battle with Kimi Raikkonen, going past him was mega – I really enjoyed that. We're not the best of friends but we battle hard but clean." [...] Alonso did not feel frustrated towards teammate Räikkönen over the pair's late-race battle for sixth place: [...] "The most important thing was not the battle with him, it was the battle with the other teams and we got some good points for Ferrari today. Even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> overtaken Kimi a little quicker I had to save a lot of fuel {{in the last couple of}} laps so a battle with Sebastian was never a possibility." [...] Räikkönen dismissed the battle as [...] "normal racing" [...] and felt the duel had not hindered his team because it made no difference for him or Ferrari, and no matter where he finished, the team would accumulate the same amount of points.|$|E
