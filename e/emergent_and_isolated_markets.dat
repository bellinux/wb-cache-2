40|$|Working Paper Series: 04 / 2009 In {{this paper}} we report {{empirical}} evidence from a mixed methods approach to investigating the {{drivers of innovation}} in New Zealand. The evidence comes from a primary questionnaire survey we conducted across seventy-five local firms plus fifteen face-to-face case study interviews. Our survey response data is analysed using four different types of probability models and the various models are all found to be largely consistent with each other. The insights from these estimation methods are then bolstered by detailed follow-up case studies of individual firms in different industries and product groups regarding their innovation and competition experiences. Our results from both forms of evidence-gathering suggest that in a small <b>and</b> <b>isolated</b> local <b>market</b> such as New Zealand, smallness in terms of firm size {{may not be an}} advantage for innovation. The reason appears to be that the notion of ‘small’ itself may have an absolute minimum threshold, below which translating entrepreneurship into innovation becomes problematic. As such, applying theories of local economic development to local economies which exhibit similar features to New Zealand may require us to adjust our thinking in order to take account of different absolute scale effects in different types of economies...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} a market {{orientation}} it is not universally accepted to be beneficial despite strong support for its status as an intangible resource supportive of a competitive advantage. Research on market orientation is largely quantitatively based focussing on justifying the performance link rather than determining what actually is a market orientation. This paper contends that in its current state, market orientation research is trapped in a quantitatively-driven research paradigm, unable to investigate and translate what market orientation is {{and how it can}} be applied. It is suggested an over reliance upon quantitative methods has largely limited research to identifying the relative degree of market orientation for a specific entity within a sample at the expense of expanding our understanding of the construct. A qualitative case study approach potentially offers researchers a means through which to respond to the challenge of Gable's (1995) desired research agenda. Three possible case study approaches are identified; firstly, pattern matching (identify market orientation), secondly, the industrial networks approach (to <b>isolate</b> <b>and</b> explain <b>market</b> orientation), and lastly, action research (to demonstrate the value of future market orientation research) ...|$|R

It is possible to manage the relationship between prescriptive <b>and</b> <b>emergent</b> learning, both of which need to be part of an integrated learning ecology...|$|R

In 1939, the search for a synthetic substitute for atropine culminated serendipitously in the discovery of meperidine, the first opiate with a structure altogether different from that of morphine.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{submerged}} macrophytes provide a refuge for zooplankton against fish predation, whereas the role of <b>emergent</b> <b>and</b> floating-leaved species, which are often dominant in eutrophic turbid lakes, is far less investigated. Zooplankton density in open water <b>and</b> amongst <b>emergent</b> <b>and</b> floating-leaved vegetation was monitored in a small, eutrophic lake (Frederiksborg Slotsso) in Denmark during July-October 2006. <b>Emergent</b> <b>and</b> floating-leaved macrophytes harboured significantly higher densities of pelagic as well as plant-associated zooplankton species, compared to the open water, even during periods where the predation pressure was presumably high (during the recruitment of 0 + fish fry). Zooplankton abundance in open water and among vegetation exhibited low values in July and peaked in August. Bosmina and Ceriodaphnia dominated the zooplankton community in the littoral vegetated areas (up to 4, 400 ind/l among Phragmites australis and 11, 000 ind/l between Polygonum amphibium stands), whereas the dominant species in the pelagic were Daphnia (up to 67 ind/l) and Cyclops (41 ind/l). The zooplankton density pattern observed was probably a consequence of concomitant modifications in the predation pressure, refuge availability and concentration of cyanobacteria in the lake. It is suggested that <b>emergent</b> <b>and</b> floating-leaved macrophytes may {{play an important role in}} enhancing water clarity due to increased grazing pressure by zooplankton migrating into the plant stands. As a consequence, especially in turbid lakes, the ecological role of these functional types of vegetation, and not merely that of submerged macrophyte species, should be taken into consideration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Vegetation {{abundance}} along undeveloped {{and developed}} shorelines of Minnesota lakes {{was compared to}} test the hypothesis that development has not altered abundance of <b>emergent</b> <b>and</b> floating-leaf vegetation. Aerial photographs of clear water centrarchid-walleye Stizostedion vitreum lakes were analyzed for vegetation. Vegetative coverage was estimated in 12 randomly selected 935 m 2 digitized photograph plots for both developed and undeveloped shorelines of 44 lakes across a gradient of development. Vegetative cover in littoral areas adjacent to developed shores was less abundant than along undeveloped shorelines. On average, there was a 66 % reduction in vegetation coverage with development. The estimated loss of <b>emergent</b> <b>and</b> floating-leaf coverage from human development for all Minnesota’s clear water centrarchid-walleye lakes was 20 to 28 %. Significant correlations were detected between occurrence of <b>emergent</b> <b>and</b> floating-leaf plant species and relative biomass and mean size of northern pike Esox lucius, bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, and pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus (Spearman Rho, P < 0. 05).
