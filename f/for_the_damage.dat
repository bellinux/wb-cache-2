5|$|Doggett first {{appears in}} the fifth episode. She wishes to hang up a cross in Litchfield Penitentiary's chapel but is refused permission. She ignores this and hangs her cross up on a light fixture; this causes the entire fixture to fall down and hence damages the chapel's ceiling. She also {{displays}} transphobia; calling the transgender woman Sophia Burset (played by Laverne Cox) an 'abomination' and 'it' and blaming her <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> to the chapel. Doggett has numerous clashes with Alex Vause (played by Laura Prepon); firstly Vause threatens to rape Doggett after growing tired of her complaining about Piper Chapman (played by Taylor Schilling); Doggett locks Vause in a dryer while she is helping Chapman to fix it and, lastly, Doggett snitches on Chapman and Vause for dancing provocatively with each other; resulting in Chapman being placed in solitary confinement.|$|E
5|$|Saruman {{makes his}} final {{appearance}} {{at the end of}} the last volume, The Return of the King (1955), after Sauron's defeat. After persuading the Ents to release him from Orthanc, he travels north on foot, apparently reduced to begging. He is accompanied by Wormtongue, whom he beats and curses. When they reach the Shire, Saruman's agents—both Hobbits and Men—have already taken it over and started a destructive process of industrialization. Saruman governs the Shire in secret under the name of Sharkey until the events of chapter 8 ("The Scouring of the Shire") in which Frodo and his companions return and lead a rebellion, defeating the intruders and exposing Saruman's role. Even after Saruman attempts to stab Frodo, Frodo lets him go. When Saruman blames Wormtongue <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> done to the Shire and curses him, Wormtongue finally snaps and slits his master's throat.|$|E
5|$|The details {{surrounding}} Warkworth Castle's {{role in the}} English Civil War are unclear, but {{the conflict}} resulted in further damage to the structure. Initially held by Royalist forces, the castle was still important enough that when the Scots invaded in 1644 they forced its surrender. Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland, supported Parliament, which may have prevented the Scots from doing much damage to the castle. Parliamentarian forces took over the castle in 1648; when they withdrew they removed the castle's doors and iron {{so that it could}} not be reused by the enemy. They may also have partially demolished some of the castle, and may be responsible for its present state. Algernon Percy unsuccessfully applied for compensation in 1649 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|E

5|$|Throughout the Tidewater region, {{there were}} {{estimates}} {{of thousands of}} downed trees, and hundreds of homes and businesses were damaged. Of these, about 40 structures were declared uninhabitable. Debris was blown several blocks inland from the coast. Among the hardest hit locations was Sandbridge, where about 12 homes were severely damaged. It is reported that the state was unprepared <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage,</b> expecting a strike from a weakened tropical storm. About $15.3million (1998 USD) in damage was inflicted in the Virginia Beach and Norfolk areas. Throughout the state, insured losses totaled $95million (1998 USD).|$|E
5|$|A {{state of}} {{emergency}} was declared for Aklan, where property damage equated to ₱51million (US$1million). The Central Visayas region of the Philippines suffered the worst impacts, with a damage cost of ₱345.2million (US$7million), primarily to agriculture. Following the storm's passage, chapters of the Philippine Red Cross assisted in relief efforts in impacted areas. The Philippine Department of Social Welfare and Development allocated ₱27.7million (US$600,000) to relief efforts. Food and sheltering were provided to 2,615people in three provinces by the Adventist Development and Relief Agency. Many localized relief agencies donated sacks of rice to impacted residents. The United Nations appealed for US$46million for use in recovery efforts following Utor {{in addition to the}} three Philippine typhoons which preceded it. Overall, the impacts of Utor killed 30people and injured 44in the Philippines. Another eight people were never accounted <b>for.</b> <b>The</b> <b>damage</b> toll wrought by Utor amounted to US$15.8million. Furthermore, 36,542houses were damaged by Utor, of which 9,439were destroyed. Capiz and Aklan were the areas that sustained the most residential damage. People who were evacuated out of hazardous regions in advance of Utor were able to return home beginning on December18, nine days after initial landfall.|$|E
5|$|American {{officials}} later {{acknowledged that}} the evidence cited by the U.S. in its rationale for the Al-Shifa strike was weaker than initially believed: The facility had not been involved in chemical weapons production, and was not connected to bin Laden. The $30 million Al-Shifa factory, which had a $199,000 contract with the UN under the Oil-for-Food Programme, employed 300 Sudanese and provided {{over half of the}} country's pharmaceuticals, including medicines for malaria, diabetes, gonorrhea, and tuberculosis. A Sudanese named Salah Idris purchased the plant in March 1998; while the CIA later said it found financial ties between Idris and the bin Laden-linked terrorist group Egyptian Islamic Jihad, the agency had been unaware at the time that Idris owned the Al-Shifa facility. Idris later denied any links to bin Laden and sued to recover $24 million in funds frozen by the U.S., as well as <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> to his factory. Idris hired investigations firm Kroll Inc., which reported in February 1999 that neither Idris nor Al-Shifa was connected to terrorism.|$|E

5|$|Benbow {{was soon}} at sea again in March 1695, being {{appointed}} commander-in-chief of His Majesty's ships {{which were then}} {{off the coast of}} France. His squadron was highly successful, taking a number of French merchants in early April and bringing them to England as prizes. Benbow was recommended by Lord Berkeley, who had served with Benbow at Saint-Malo, to be promoted to rear-admiral at the next opportunity, and in the meantime he was appointed to the command of the 70-gun HMS Northumberland. He was soon joined by a volunteer – his then fourteen-year-old son – also named John Benbow. Benbow then sailed with Berkeley and the Dutch lieutenant-admiral Philips van Almonde to Saint-Malo, intending to operate against privateering operations being conducted from the area. Benbow moved to command HMS Charles Galley, to direct the inshore operations of ten English and Dutch warships, nine English bomb vessels, and seventeen small boats and vessels. They began operations on their arrival off Saint-Malo on 4 July, remaining in action until evening the next day when they withdrew, without having achieved any decisive result. Several houses had been destroyed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> and loss of a few of the bomb vessels. Benbow was given eight bomb vessels and seven or eight frigates and was dispatched down the coast. He attacked Granville on 8 July, shelling it with over 900 bombs over several hours, and departed having set the town ablaze.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} fertile {{crescent}} civilizations {{are considered the}} oldest in history, {{at the time the}} Burney Relief was made other late bronze age civilizations were equally in full bloom. Travel and cultural exchange were not commonplace, but nevertheless possible. To the east, Elam with its capital Susa was in frequent military conflict with Isin, Larsa and later Babylon. Even further, the Indus Valley Civilization was already past its peak, and in China, the Erlitou culture blossomed. To the southwest, Egypt was ruled by the 12th dynasty, further to the west the Minoan civilization, centred on Crete with the Old Palace in Knossos, dominated the Mediterranean. To the north of Mesopotamia, the Anatolian Hittites were establishing their Old Kingdom over the Hattians; they brought an end to Babylon's empire with the sack of the city in 1531BCE. Indeed, Collon mentions this raid as possibly being the reason <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> to the right-hand side of the relief.|$|E
5|$|Helicoverpa zea is {{the most}} common and {{destructive}} pest of soybean growth in Virginia. About one-third of Virginia acreage is treated annually with pounds of insecticide, costing farmers around 2 million dollars. The degree of damage varies {{on the size of the}} pest infestation, the timing, and the stage of the plant. However, soybean plants are capable of withstanding a large amount of damage without substantial yield loss depending on soil moisture, planting date, and weather. If the damage is early in the plants life, then damage will mostly be to the leaves. Plants compensate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> by processes such as increasing seed size in remaining pods. Most damage happens in August, when the plants are flowering. Attacks that happen after August do much less damage because many pods have developed tougher walls that H. zea can't penetrate. Infestations that affect pod formation and seed filling have the potential to reduce yields, and because this happens in the later stages of plants, they have less time to compensate.|$|E

5|$|In 1760, {{with the}} Seven Years' War raging, Euler's farm in Charlottenburg was ransacked by {{advancing}} Russian troops. Upon learning of this event, General Ivan Petrovich Saltykov paid compensation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> caused to Euler's estate, later Empress Elizabeth of Russia added a further payment of 4000 roubles – an exorbitant amount at the time. The {{political situation in}} Russia stabilized after Catherine the Great's accession to the throne, so in 1766 Euler accepted an invitation {{to return to the}} St. Petersburg Academy. His conditions were quite exorbitant – a 3000 ruble annual salary, a pension for his wife, and the promise of high-ranking appointments for his sons. All of these requests were granted. He spent {{the rest of his life}} in Russia. However, his second stay in the country was marred by tragedy. A fire in St. Petersburg in 1771 cost him his home, and almost his life. In 1773, he lost his wife Katharina after 40 years of marriage.|$|E
5|$|In November 1938, a young Jewish man {{requested}} {{an interview}} with the German ambassador in Paris and met with a legation secretary, whom he shot and killed to protest his family's treatment in Germany. This incident provided the pretext for a pogrom the NSDAP incited against the Jews on 9 November 1938. Members of the SA damaged or destroyed synagogues and Jewish property throughout Germany. At least 91 German Jews were killed during this pogrom, later called Kristallnacht, the Night of Broken Glass. Further restrictions were imposed on Jews in the coming months– they were forbidden to own businesses or work in retail shops, drive cars, go to the cinema, visit the library or own weapons and Jewish pupils were removed from schools. The Jewish community was fined one billion marks to pay <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> caused by Kristallnacht and told that any money received via insurance claims would be confiscated. By 1939, around 250,000 of Germany's 437,000 Jews emigrated to the United States, Argentina, Great Britain, Palestine and other countries. Many chose to stay in continental Europe. Emigrants to Palestine were allowed to transfer property there {{under the terms of the}} Haavara Agreement, but those moving to other countries had to leave virtually all their property behind and it was seized by the government.|$|E
5|$|Marge asks Belle {{to close}} down the burlesque house, but Belle refuses, saying that {{the house is a}} part of Springfield.

The mob arrives at the house and immediately starts destroying things. Bart and Homer arrive and Homer decides to try to convince the mob to stop. He does so by singing a musical number accompanied by Belle and some of her dancers. The town soon joins in and are convinced to let the house stay. However, Marge arrives with a bulldozer, having missed the song. The town announces their intentions to let the house stay, but Marge tries to sing her own song about her views.

5|$|The Americans, British, and French all {{differed}} on {{the issue}} of reparations settlement. The Western Front had been fought in France, and that countryside had been heavily scarred in the fighting. France's most industrialized region in the north-east had been laid to waste during the German retreat. Hundreds of mines and factories were destroyed along with railroads, bridges and villages. Georges Clemenceau, the Prime Minister of France, thought it appropriate that any just peace required Germany to pay reparations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> they had caused. He also saw reparations as a means to ensure that Germany could not again threaten France and as well to weaken the German ability to compete with France's industrialization. Reparations would also go towards the reconstruction costs in other countries, such as Belgium, also directly affected by the war. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George opposed harsh reparations in favour of a less crippling reparations settlement so that the German economy could remain a viable economic power and British trading partner. He furthermore argued that reparations should include war pensions for disabled veterans and allowances to be paid to war widows, which would, reserve a larger share of the reparations for the British Empire. Wilson opposed these positions, and was adamant that there be no indemnity imposed upon Germany.|$|E
