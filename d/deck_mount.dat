5000|$|The {{next month}} {{was spent in}} a [...] "stand down" [...] status with the crew working half days while most took some leave. The only major work was a change in her Electronic Warfare (EW) configuration. The SAMID Immediate Package Program or SAMID (Ship's Anti-missile Integrated Defense) (designed by RCA) {{consisting}} of 2 ASROC <b>deck</b> <b>mounted</b> CHAFFROC launchers with blast shields, ASROC <b>deck</b> <b>mounted</b> SAMID HUT (AN/SLQ-19 B) electronics package, and support antennas mounted on port and starboard sides at the ASROC & after-ECM 02 deck level, was removed from Hanson. In November, USS Hanson followed USS Hancock CVA 19 just out of San Francisco, CA, for plane guard duties lasting about 1 week before Thanksgiving Day of November 1971. After her plane guard duty with the USS Hancock of about 1 week, USS Hanson returned to San Diego.|$|R
50|$|The first Typhoon, the Mk-23, was {{released}} in 1997. The weapon is mounted on a stabilized <b>deck</b> <b>mounting</b> which allows it to remain on target as the platform beneath it moves. The stabilizer has an accuracy of 0.25 mrad, allowing it to keep the weapon aimed to within 250 mm on a target 1000 m away.|$|R
50|$|Water tank - a large {{irregular}} shaped container(s), {{often made}} of stainless steel, {{that is usually}} fitted into the bilges of a voyaging boat. The tank often has a <b>deck</b> <b>mounted</b> inlet, a vent pipe and a pump to move water to taps, showers etc. Mounted low in the hull, it adds significantly to stability when full.|$|R

The cabin intake is offset to prevent water entering the cabin. The upper section swivels to stop breaking seas entering the dorade. Named after the 1931 yacht Dorade where it was first used.|$|R
5000|$|She was {{designed}} by Blaise Ollivier, with 26 x 8-pounder guns, and was launched in February 1741 at Brest. She {{is regarded as the}} first of the 'true' frigate designs: she was built with two decks, but only the upper <b>deck</b> <b>mounted</b> guns. [...] These guns were relatively heavy, and the higher mounting meant that they could be used in rough seas.|$|R
5000|$|The {{two ships}} of the Calliope sub-class - HMS Calliope and Champion - {{were the last}} pair of the eight [...] "light {{armoured}} cruisers" [...] to be ordered in July and August 1914 under the 1913 Programme. They both had geared turbines, the first Royal Navy cruisers to be so fitted. They also had increased belt armour; Champion had just two screws. They were commissioned in mid to late 1915, as modifications to the Caroline subclass with higher speeds, a more efficient boiler layout {{and a reduction in}} the number of funnels to two. The two ships had different machinery types for comparative purposes. Calliope and Champion underwent similar gun armament modifications to the Caroline subclass. They also had underwater tubes rather than the <b>deck</b> <b>mounted</b> weapons of the Caroline subclass and were given two twin <b>deck</b> <b>mounted</b> torpedo tubes during the war but these were later removed to reduce top weight.|$|R

50|$|The {{turntable}} {{is about}} 100 ft {{east of the}} engine house. It is 50 ft in diameter, consisting of a steel <b>deck</b> <b>mounted</b> on a central pier and topped by wooden decking. The outer portion of the turntable rests on a rail attached to the concrete retaining wall that encircles the structure. A small operator's shed stands at {{the western edge of}} the turntable.|$|R
5000|$|An {{alternative}} to tube based systems are pre-insulated, HDPE modular heat exchange themapanel units. The HDPE modular thermapanels fit pedestal mounted pavers (typically used on rooftop installations) in a modular grid layout of between 23.5" [...] - 26" [...] on center. They {{may also be}} used with any type of ground mounted, cast in place concrete or raised <b>deck</b> <b>mounted</b> pavers, wood or PVC decking.|$|R
5000|$|Novorossiysk was a {{conventionally}} powered heavy aircraft carrying cruiser or {{aircraft carrier}} that served the Soviet Navy, {{and later the}} Russian Navy, from 1982 to 1993. She was the third [...] vessel to be built. She was designed to engage in offensive actions as a guided missile cruiser mostly using her <b>deck</b> <b>mounted</b> missiles as well as support anti-submarine and surface actions with her embarked air group.|$|R
500|$|The Bismarck-class ships had an {{armoured}} {{belt that}} ranged in thickness from the thickest section of armour covered the central portion, where the gun turrets, ammunition magazines, and machinery spaces were located. This {{portion of the}} belt was capped on either end by 220mm thick transverse bulkheads. The ships had an upper deck that was [...] thick, and an armoured deck that was between 100–120mm (3.9–4.7in) thick amidships, and tapered down to [...] at the bow and [...] at the stern. The <b>deck</b> was <b>mounted</b> low in the hull, however, which reduced the volume of internal space protected by the armoured citadel. This contrasted with contemporary British and American designs that featured a single thick armoured <b>deck</b> <b>mounted</b> high in the ship.|$|R
50|$|An early {{attempt to}} produce such a ship {{was made in}} the early 1880s by Robert Fryer, who built the Alice at a cost of some £14,000 after twelve years of experimentation. It {{consisted}} of three paddle wheels in a rough triangular layout, with a flat <b>deck</b> <b>mounted</b> above them; there was apparently no other propulsion. The project was a complete failure, perhaps {{due to the lack of}} any propulsion other than the paddles.|$|R
50|$|The Bismarck-class ships had an {{armoured}} {{belt that}} ranged in thickness from 220 to 320 mm; the thickest section of armour covered the central portion, where the gun turrets, ammunition magazines, and machinery spaces were located. This {{portion of the}} belt was capped on either end by 220 mm thick transverse bulkheads. The ships had an upper deck that was 50 mm thick, and an armoured deck that was between 100-120 mm (3.9-4.7 in) thick amidships, and tapered down to 60 mm at the bow and 80 mm at the stern. The <b>deck</b> was <b>mounted</b> low in the hull, however, which reduced the volume of internal space protected by the armoured citadel.

50|$|Riding mowers (U.S. and Canada) or ride-on mowers (U.K. and Canada) are {{a popular}} {{alternative}} for large lawns. The operator {{is provided with}} a seat and controls on the mower and literally rides on the machine. Most use the horizontal rotating blade system, though usually with multiple blades. A common form of ride-on mower is the lawn tractor. These are usually designed to resemble a small agricultural tractor, with the cutting <b>deck</b> <b>mounted</b> amidships between {{the front and rear}} axles.|$|R

500|$|The {{ship was}} {{armed with a}} main battery of four /35 caliber guns guns in two twin-gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The {{secondary}} battery consisted of fourteen /40 caliber Mark IV guns, which were placed in casemates in the hull. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried sixteen 6-pounder guns mounted in casemates {{along the side of}} the hull and six 1-pounder guns. As was standard for capital ships of the period, Alabama carried four [...] torpedo tubes in <b>deck</b> <b>mounted</b> launchers.|$|R

As was standard for capital ships of the period, Wisconsin carried four 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in <b>deck</b> <b>mounted</b> torpedo launchers.|$|R
50|$|Hawkins was {{decommissioned}} {{again in}} May 1930 and {{reduced to the}} Reserve Fleet. She was recommissioned again in 1932 to become the Flagship of the 4th Cruiser Squadron in the East Indies, before again being reduced to the reserve in April 1935. The terms of the London Naval Treaty meant that in 1937, Hawkins was demilitarised and had all her 7.5 inch guns and the <b>deck</b> <b>mounted</b> torpedo tubes removed before she was again returned to reserve status. In September 1938 plans were drawn up to utilise Hawkins as a Cadets' Training Ship.|$|R
50|$|She {{was armed}} with a main battery of four 13 in/35 caliber guns guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The {{secondary}} battery consisted of fourteen 6 in/40 caliber Mark IV guns, which were placed in casemates in the hull. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried sixteen 6-pounder guns mounted in casemates {{along the side of}} the hull and six 1-pounder guns. As was standard for capital ships of the period, Illinois carried four 18 in torpedo tubes in <b>deck</b> <b>mounted</b> launchers.|$|R
50|$|On 21 May, the Ardent {{moved into}} {{position}} in Falkland Sound {{as the lead}} ship to bombard Argentine positions in order to divert {{the attention of the}} enemy force from the British landing in the San Carlo inlet. Leake operated a <b>deck</b> <b>mounted</b> machine gun during the ensuing attacks by Argentine aircraft, and was credited with downing an Argentine Douglas A-4 Skyhawk, puncturing the plane's fuel tanks. He continued to man the gun whilst the ship was hit by seventeen missiles and bombs. Along with the remaining crew, Leake abandoned ship, boarding HMS Yarmouth, which pulled alongside the listing Ardent.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of torpedo tube: {{underwater}} tubes fitted to submarines and some surface ships, and deck-mounted units (also referred to as torpedo launchers) installed aboard surface vessels. Deck-mounted torpedo launchers are usually designed for {{a specific type of}} torpedo, while submarine torpedo tubes are general-purpose launchers, and are often also capable of deploying mines and cruise missiles. Most modern launchers are standardised on a 12.75 in diameter for light torpedoes (<b>deck</b> <b>mounted</b> aboard ship) or a 21 in diameter for heavy torpedoes (underwater tubes), although other sizes of torpedo tube have been used: see Torpedo classes and diameters.|$|R
