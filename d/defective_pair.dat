40|$|An {{increasing}} number of recessively inherited human diseases are being {{explained in terms of}} a missing or defective enzyme. The resulting aberration of metabolism is reflected, in many cases, in an altered composition of metabolites in the urine and other body fluids. Progress in this field is dependent on making the initial association between a familial disease and an aberration of body chemistry. The development of comprehensive analytic systems for the detection of abnormal quantities or kinds of metabolites in biologic fluids obtained from patients with inherited diseases should greatly facilitate this process. Biochemical characterization, at an enzyme level, then becomes possible and is essential for improved diagnosisand rational approaches to treatment of the disease. IN RECENT YEARS, remarkable {{progress has been made in}} our under-standing of the genetic mechanisms involved jim production of human disease states. An ever-{{increasing number}} of recessively inherited dis-eases are being explained in terms of a deficient or defective eimzyme resulting from a <b>defective</b> <b>pair</b> of genes. The resulting disruption in a normal pathway of metabolism is often reflected in a change in com-position of urinary metabolites. As a consequence of these advances, the clinical recognition and the biochemical characterization of many of these familial diseases have become more precise, and some types of disorders can now be treated successfully. This progress has been greatly facilitated by the remarkable advances in our knowledge of basic biochemistry made in the past two decades, as well as the in-creasing sophistication of the clinicians in the field of biochemistry. However, the rate of this progress in explaining hereditary diseases in terms of biochemical defects is seriously hampered by limitations that are, to a large extent, technical problems.

Excessive disparity values correspond to an exaggerated depth range; they may strain the binocular fusion faculty of the subject and may cause the scene depth to be perceived inaccurately.

50|$|At {{the end of}} 2011, Honeywell—the {{corporate}} conglomerate who {{purchased the}} Xtratuf brand in 2008—closed its plant in Rock Island, Illinois where Xtratufs had been made since the 1970s, and moved production to an existing Honeywell facility in China. Reportedly, 250 to 300 people lost their jobs, as David Pauley, mayor of Rock Island, told Alaska’s KCAW radio station in 2010. As {{a result of the}} move, many have complained quality has fallen dramatically. The company responded to initial concerns in quality by offering to replace <b>defective</b> <b>pairs</b> of boots, and by stating that quality issues in initial production runs have been addressed. In response to public outcry, Alaska Senator Mark Begich even wrote a letter to Honeywell Safety Products asking they bring manufacture of its storied boot back to the U.S. A Honeywell spokesman remarked at the time production moved to China to keep the company competitive in the global marketplace. In late 2013, the company engaged in a public relations campaign to reassure consumers that product quality production issues have been addressed. Production of all lines remains overseas, with no plans announced as of 2013 to return manufacturing to the United States.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In [ChM 07] {{we studied}} triple-point {{defective}} very ample linear systems on regular surfaces, and {{we showed that}} they can only exist if the surface is ruled. In the present paper we show that we can drop the regularity assumption, and we classify the triplepoint defective very ample linear systems on ruled surfaces. Let S be a smooth projective surface, K = KS the canonical class and L a divisor class on S We study a classical interpolation problem for the pair (S, L), namely whether for a general point p ∈ S the linear system |L − 3 p | has the expected dimension expdim |L − 3 p | = max{− 1, dim |L | − 6 }. If {{this is not the}} case we call the pair (S, L) triple-point defective. This paper is indeed a continuation of [ChM 07], where some classification of triple point <b>defective</b> <b>pairs</b> is achieved, under the assumptions: L, L − K very ample, and (L − K) 2 > 16, conditions that we will take all over the paper. With these assumptions, the main result of [ChM 07] says that all triplepoint defective regular surfaces are rationally ruled. We tackled the problem by considering |L− 3 p | as fibres of the the map α in the following diagram...|$|R

Then they synapse, as the linear protein core (axial element or lateral element) of each homologous chromosome is joined together by a transverse central element, forming the tripartite synaptonemal complex (SC). Ten uncloned Zea mays mutants in our collection were surveyed by transmission electron microscopy by making silver-stained spreads of SCs to identify mutants with non-homologous synapsis or improper synapsis. To analyse the mutants further, zyp 1, the maize orthologue of the Arabidopsis central element component ZYP 1 was cloned and an antibody was made against it. Using antibodies against ZYP 1 and the lateral element components AFD 1 and ASY 1, {{it was found that}} most mutants form normal SCs but are <b>defective</b> in <b>pairing.</b> The large number of non-homologous synapsis mutants <b>defective</b> in <b>pairing</b> illustrates that synapsis and pairing can be uncoupled. Of the ten mutants studied, only dsy 2 undergoes normal homologous chromosome recognition needed for homologous pairing. The dsy 2 mutation fails to maintain the SC. ZYP 1 elongation is blocked at zygotene, and only dots of ZYP 1 are seen at prophase I. Another mutant, mei*N 2415 showed incomplete but homologous synapsis and ASY 1 and AFD 1 have a normal distribution. Although installation of ZYP 1 is initiated at zygotene, its progression is slowed down and not completed by pachytene in some cells and ZYP 1 is not retained on pachytene chromosomes.

40|$|The POINT-AGAPE collaboration, an {{international}} project looking for gravitational microlensing towards the Andromeda galaxy, uses the 'superpixel' technique to detect MAssive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). The 3 -year survey has discovered {{about a dozen}} microlensing candidates. Part I of the thesis describes the project's background. Dark matter is discussed (cliapter 1). Microlensing is explained, emphasising the POINT-AGAPE work, and the superpixel technique is introduced (chapter 2). CCD technology and the Isaac Newton Telescope are discussed (chapter 3). In Part II the three recent POINT-AGAPE pipelines and their results are detailed, including the work at Queen Mary. The elimination of Mira variables is discussed, these masquerade as microlensing events (chapters 4 - 6). In addition we estimate the efficiency of detecting microlensing events (chapter 7). Part III describes various methodological issues associated with thesuperpixel technique, which uses a program called SExtractor to detect lightcurves with a bump. However, this generates fake lightcurves associated with CCD defects, bad pixels and resolved stars. Likelihood maps are investigated (chapter 8). The bad pixels and resolved stars were masked, but no mask is perfect {{and it is important}} to understand the degree of incompleteness. CCD defects are studied, their causes and effects are analysed; as are bright variable objects (chapter 9). In particular, a new method is described, involving close pairs of variables, which can be used in analysing the defects (chapter 10). Tight groups of variables are studied and bad columns analysed (chapter 11). Telescope pointing is investigated, relating offsets with defects and analysing anomalies in the bad columns. Field close pairs are discussed; once <b>defective</b> <b>pairs</b> are accounted for, what remains are genuine close pairs (chapter 12). Part IV discusses a search made for Cepheids (chapter 13) and summarises a coauthored paper on Nova discoveries in M 31 (chapter 14).

30|$|A lower {{value of}} the hyperchromic {{coefficient}} and a broad interval of the helix-coil transition which starts actually from room temperatures point to the heterogeneity of the double-helical structure hybridized on the carbon nanotube surface. DNA melting at room temperature indicates the presence of very short unstable sections in the duplex structure. Obviously, such a heterogeneity in the poly(rI)∙рoly(rC)NT structure {{is a result of}} the strong polymer interaction with the nanotube surface, which makes difficult the successive hybridization along the whole polymer length. The small {{value of the}} hyperchromic coefficient indicates that a part of the bases does not take part in hybridization and other ones form <b>defective</b> base <b>pairs</b> distorted with the curvature of the nanotube surface on which hybridized pairs do not reach the conformation with the optimal energy. It is likely that in this case, only one H-bond is created between nitrogen bases[17]. Of course, the presence of only one H-bond does not decrease directly the stacking and hyperchromic coefficient of the duplex. However, weak base pairing because of the missing second H-bond may result in larger twisting of bases in the pair and, in turn, in the decrease of stacking between the neighbors along chain bases.|$|R

40|$|In the pairing-site model, {{specialized}} regions on each chromosome {{function to}} establish meiotic homolog pairing. Analysis {{of these sites}} could provide insights into the mechanism used by Drosophila females to form a synaptonemal complex (SC) {{in the absence of}} meiotic recombination. These specialized sites were first established on the X chromosome by noting that there were barriers to crossover suppression caused by translocation heterozygotes. These sites were genetically mapped and proposed to be pairing sites. By comparing the cytological breakpoints of third chromosome translocations to their patterns of crossover suppression, we have mapped two sites on chromosome 3 R. We have performed experiments to determine if these sites have a role in meiotic homolog pairing and the initiation of recombination. Translocation heterozygotes exhibit reduced gene conversion within the crossover-suppressed region, consistent with an effect on the initiation of meiotic recombination. To determine if homolog pairing is disrupted in translocation heterozygotes, we used fluorescent in situ hybridization to measure the extent of homolog pairing. In wild-type oocytes, homologs are paired along their entire lengths prior to accumulation of the SC protein C(3) G. Surprisingly, translocation heterozygotes exhibited homolog pairing similar to wild type within the crossover-suppressed regions. This result contrasted with our observations of c(3) G mutant females, which were found to be <b>defective</b> in <b>pairing.</b> We propose that each Drosophila chromosome is divided into several domains by specialized sites. These sites are not required for homolog pairing. Instead, the initiation of meiotic recombination requires continuity of the meiotic chromosome structure within each of these domains...|$|R
40|$|During meiosis, DNA {{replication}} {{is followed}} by two successive rounds of chromosome segregation (meiosis I and II), which give rise to genetically diverse haploid gametes. The prophase of the first meiotic division is highly regulated and alignment and synapsis of the homologous chromosomes during this stage are mediated by the synaptonemal complex. Incorrect assembly of the synaptonemal complex results in cell death, impaired meiotic recombination and aneuploidy. Oocytes with meiotic defects often survive the first meiotic prophase and give rise to aneuploid gametes. Similarly affected spermatocytes, on the other hand, almost always undergo apoptosis at a male-specific meiotic checkpoint, located specifically at epithelial stage IV during spermatogenesis. Many examples of this stage IV-specific arrest have been described for several genetic mouse models in which DNA repair or meiotic recombination are abrogated. Interestingly, in C. elegans, meiotic recombination and synapsis are monitored by two separate checkpoint pathways. Therefore we studied spermatogenesis in several knockout mice (Sycp 1 (-/-), Sycp 3 (-/-), Smc 1 beta(-/-) and Sycp 3 /Sycp 1 and Sycp 3 /Smc 1 beta double-knockouts) that are specifically <b>defective</b> in meiotic <b>pairing</b> and synapsis. Like for recombination defects, we found that all these genotypes also specifically arrest at epithelial stage IV. It seems that the epithelial stage IV checkpoint eliminates spermatocytes that fail a certain quality check, being either synapsis or DNA damage relate...|$|R
40|$|Current {{microarray}} {{technology is}} using fluorescently modified oligonucleotides as the probe to label the target sequences, and the fluorescent intensity read by specific instruments, such as fluorescent scanner, fluorescent microscope, and etc., {{is used to}} evaluate the complementarity between the probe and the immobilized sequences on slide surface. The selectivity of this technology is limited, especially for hybridizations with point mutation. The fluorescent dyes can be photobleached easily and sometimes the fluorescent intensity is very low which will affect the accuracy of the resulting readouts. In this project, we developed the fundamental basis of a novel DNA detection system that employs micron scale particles as the label and hydrodynamic force as the 2 ̆ 2 selective pressure 2 ̆ 2 to identify the target molecules on arrayed biosensors. Single stranded oligonucleotide-coated microspheres were allowed to bind firmly to a surface covered with complementary single stranded oligonucleotides under quiescent conditions, and then a controlled flow was applied to detach the particles from the surface. We studied the effects of applied shear force on adherent microspheres to find the critical shear stress necessary to break the bonds between the particles and substrate, and used it to represent the strength of microsphere adhesion. Results showed that the adhesion strength was functions of DNA coverage on slide surfaces and salt concentration in hybridization buffers, and it could be correlated with the degree of DNA chain overlap. The system also showed weaker adhesion strength for the <b>defective</b> DNA <b>pairs</b> with single base mismatch when compared with perfectly complementary hybridization. Moreover, Adhesive Dynamics model was developed to simulate the specific adhesion of microspheres mediated by DNA hybridization. We considered the effects of parameters such as site densities on both bead and substrate surfaces, reaction rate of the molecular binding, binding affinity between adhesive molecules, magnitude of fluid flow and mechanical properties of the adhesive bonds. We showed that the experimental results could be regenerated by this model, and the adhesion strengths could be correlated with thermodynamics, kinetics and mechanochemical properties of oligonucleotide molecules. Therefore, we conclude that there are specific relationships between the DNA chemistry and adhesive force, and the microsphere adhesion system is an effective detection tool to explore the chemistry of unknown DNA molecules. ...|$|R
40|$|We have {{characterized}} a {{group of}} regulatory mutations that alter {{the activity of the}} outer dynein arms. Three mutations were obtained as suppressors of the paralyzed central pair mutant pf 6 (Luck, D. J. L., and G. Piperno. 1989. Cell Movement. pp. 49 - 60), whereas two others were obtained as suppressors of the central pair mutant pfl 6. Recombination analysis and complementation tests indicate that all five mutations are alleles at the SUP-PF- 1 /ODA 4 locus and that each allele can restore motility to radial spoke and central <b>pair</b> <b>defective</b> strains. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis with a genomic probe for the beta-dynein heavy chain (DHC) gene confirms that this locus is tightly linked to the beta-DHC gene. Although all five mutant sup-pf- 1 alleles alter the activity of the outer dynein arm as assayed by measurements of flagellar motility, only two alleles have a discernable polypeptide defect by SDS-PAGE. We have used photolytic and proteolytic cleavage procedures to localize the polypeptide defect to an approximately 100 -kD domain downstream from the last putative nucleotide binding site. This region is encoded by approximately 5 kb of genomic DNA (Mitchell, D. R., and K. Brown. 1994. J. Cell Sci. 107 : 653 - 644). PCR amplification of wild-type and mutant DNA across this region identified one PCR product that was consistently smaller in the sup-pf- 1 DNA. Direct DNA sequencing of the PCR products revealed that two of the sup-pf- 1 mutations are distinct, in-frame deletions. These deletions occur within a region that is predicted to encode a small alpha-helical coiled-coil domain of the beta-DHC. This domain {{may play a role in}} protein-protein interactions within the outer dynein arm. Since both the size and location of this domain have been conserved in all axonemal and cytoplasmic DHCs sequenced to date, it presumably performs a common function in all dynein isoforms...|$|R
40|$|During meiosis, {{multiple}} mechanisms act {{to promote}} accurate segregation of chromosomes, ensuring that all progeny receive exactly one copy of each chromosome. To achieve this during meiosis, chromosomes need to pair, recombine, and correctly {{attach to the}} meiotic spindle. The focus of my thesis is to understand early events in meiosis that promote chromosome segregation, including telomere-led chromosome movements and crossover placement and regulation. Telomere-led chromosome movements are a conserved feature of Meiosis I. Various roles have been proposed for such chromosome motions, including promoting homolog pairing and removing inappropriate chromosomal interactions. Using a "one-dot/two-dot tetR-GFP" assay in budding yeast, I found that csm 4 [INCREMENT] strains, which are defective in telomere-led chromosome movements and proper Meiosis I disjunction, are also <b>defective</b> in homolog <b>pairing.</b> I then performed a systematic mutational analysis of CSM 4. This screen yielded one allele, csm 4 - 3, that conferred a null-like meiotic delay but had near wild-type levels of spore viability. Interestingly, compared to wild-type, csm 4 - 3 conferred an intermediate phenotype in homolog pairing, but reduced average chromosome velocity. Furthermore, I found that the meiotic delay was essential for spore viability and Meiosis I disjunction in csm 4 - 3. Based on these observations, I propose that occasional and rapid chromosome movements {{over an extended period}} of time are sufficient to promote wild-type levels of recombination and high spore viability; however, sustained and rapid chromosome movements are required to promote efficient meiotic progression. Crossover regulation is also important in promoting disjunction of homologs in Meiosis I, and is regulated through an interference-dependent mechanism involving Msh 4 -Msh 5 and Mlh 1 Mlh 3. Crossover interference helps ensure that each homolog pair receives an obligate crossover, facilitating proper disjunction in the first meiotic division. Previously, the Alani laboratory detected a crossover threshold in msh 4 / 5 mutants where meiotic crossover levels could be decreased up to two-fold without lowering spore viability. I show that a set of mlh 3 ATPase mutants do not confer a crossover threshold pattern; instead, a linear relationship was observed between spore viability and meiotic crossing over. These data are consistent with Mlh 1 -Mlh 3 acting after obligate crossover decisions have been made. iv 2018 - 01 - 2...|$|R
