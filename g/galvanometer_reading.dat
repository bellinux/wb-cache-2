40|$|A {{search coil}} is placed around a steel {{specimen}} {{put in a}} cylindrical heating furnace, and they are placed together in a magnetizing solenoid. Alternating current is passed through the solenoid, and the current induced in the search coil is measured by an alternating current galvanometer. The steel specimen containing 1. 0 % C and 1. 5 % Cr was taken, and {{the relations between the}} <b>galvanometer</b> <b>reading</b> and the temperature of the specimen were observed in the range 400 ℃ [...] 800 ℃. With this method, the following results have been obtained: [...] (1) By quenching and tempering, the solubility of Cr in ferrite decreases with the increase of the tempering temperature, the Cr atoms diffusing into the carbide. (2) By austempering, the solubility of Cr in ferrite is higher when the isothermal transformation temperature is lower. (3) Therefore, the solubility of Cr in ferrite in a chromium steel varies with the temperature. 交番磁場内に試料を置き，試料に巻いたサーチコイルに誘起する起電力を，交流検流計で測り，その値と試料の温度との関係を求める。この方法によると，従来区別のつかなかった相の状態の差異を知る事が出来る。その一例として，クロム鋼を焼入し焼戻すると，焼戻温度の上昇と共にその関係は炭素銅のそれに近づき，クロム鋼のフェライト中のクロム量が，焼戻温度の上昇と共に減少する事を推定出来る。叉恒温変態に於ても，高温で変態したものは，低温で変態したものよりもフェライト中のクロム量が低い。これは前報で述べた装置によって，精密にはかったA。変態の関係から炭化物中のクロム量を検した結果とよく一致する事を示した...|$|E
50|$|The {{galvanometer}} {{does not}} need to be calibrated, as its only function is to read zero or not zero. When measuring an unknown voltage and the <b>galvanometer</b> <b>reads</b> zero, no current is drawn from the unknown voltage and so the reading is independent of the source's internal resistance, as if by a voltmeter of infinite resistance.|$|R
50|$|A metre {{bridge is}} a simple type of {{potentiometer}} which {{may be used in}} school science laboratories to demonstrate the principle of resistance measurement by potentiometric means. A resistance wire is laid along the length of a metre rule and contact with the wire is made through a galvanometer by a slider. When the <b>galvanometer</b> <b>reads</b> zero, the ratio between the lengths of wire to the left and right of the slider is equal to the ratio between the values of a known and an unknown resistor in a parallel circuit..|$|R
50|$|The best-known bridge circuit, the Wheatstone bridge, {{was invented}} by Samuel Hunter Christie and popularized by Charles Wheatstone, and is used for {{measuring}} resistance. It is constructed from four resistors, two of known values R1 and R3 (see diagram), one whose resistance is to be determined Rx, and one which is variable and calibrated R2. Two opposite vertices are connected to a source of electric current, such as a battery, and a galvanometer is connected across the other two vertices. The variable resistor is adjusted until the <b>galvanometer</b> <b>reads</b> zero. It is then known that the ratio between the variable resistor and its neighbour R1 {{is equal to the}} ratio between the unknown resistor and its neighbour R3, which enables the value of the unknown resistor to be calculated.|$|R
25|$|Stewart {{measured}} {{radiated power}} with a thermo-pile and sensitive <b>galvanometer</b> <b>read</b> with a microscope. He {{was concerned with}} selective thermal radiation, which he investigated with plates of substances that radiated and absorbed selectively for different qualities of radiation rather than maximally for all qualities of radiation. He discussed the experiments in terms of rays which could be reflected and refracted, and which obeyed the Helmholtz reciprocity principle (though he did not use an eponym for it). He did not in this paper mention that the qualities of the rays might be described by their wavelengths, nor did he use spectrally resolving apparatus such as prisms or diffraction gratings. His work was quantitative within these constraints. He made his measurements in a room temperature environment, and quickly so as to catch his bodies in a condition near the thermal equilibrium {{in which they had}} been prepared by heating to equilibrium with boiling water. His measurements confirmed that substances that emit and absorb selectively respect the principle of selective equality of emission and absorption at thermal equilibrium.|$|R
5000|$|In the figure, [...] is {{the unknown}} {{resistance}} to be measured; [...] and [...] are resistors of known resistance and {{the resistance of}} [...] is adjustable. If {{the ratio of the}} two resistances in the known leg [...] is equal to the ratio of the two in the unknown leg [...] then the voltage between the two midpoints (B and D) will be zero and no current will flow through the galvanometer [...] If the bridge is unbalanced, the direction of the current indicates whether [...] is too high or too low. [...] is varied until there is no current through the <b>galvanometer,</b> which then <b>reads</b> zero.|$|R
5000|$|... "'Signal to noise ratio' {{is a term}} {{often used}} in physics. In fact it applies to {{everything}} we try to understand and measure, from the precision with which the deflection of a <b>galvanometer</b> can be <b>read</b> to the amount we can grasp of a conversation at a cocktail party, where the signal is what someone is saying to us and the noise is the integrated chatter of the other guests. It applies also to the fine arts. In what is perhaps one {{the greatest of all}} works of art, Michelangelo's Pietà in St. Peter's, it is nearly all signal and no noise, while {{in the work of the}} action painters it is all noise and no signal. There is nothing new in the products of the action painters. Leonardo da Vinci in his notes says that 'if you look at any walls spotted with various stains or with a mixture of different kinds of stones, if you are about to invent some scene you will be able to see in it a resemblance to different landscapes adorned with mountains etc., etc., and an infinite number of things which you can reduce into separate and well-conceived forms.'" ...|$|R
