25|$|The {{editorial}} board of Nacional reacted by accusing the police of Pukanić's death by {{failure to provide}} police protection. They stated that Pukanić's round-the-clock protection by two police officers was lifted on August 1 not by Pukanić's request in <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>mind,</b> but under a pressure from the police. Pukanić allegedly received two death threats {{after the end of}} the protection and promptly forwarded them to the police, but they failed to act upon them. The redaction also condemned the prosecution office for investigating false accusations against Pukanić instead of concentrating on finding his April assailant. As of now, there are only informal speculations as to the motive of the assassin.|$|E
25|$|The hired hand Ray Lamphere {{was deeply}} {{in love with}} Gunness; he {{performed}} any chore for her, no matter how gruesome. He became jealous of the many men who arrived to court his employer and began making scenes. She fired him on February 3, 1908. Shortly after dispensing with Lamphere, she presented herself at the La Porte County courthouse. She declared that her former employee was not in <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>mind</b> and was a menace to the public. She somehow convinced local authorities to hold a sanity hearing. Lamphere was pronounced sane and released. Gunness was back {{a few days later}} to complain to the sheriff that Lamphere had visited her farm and argued with her. She contended that he posed a threat to her family and had Lamphere arrested for trespassing.|$|E
500|$|The two volume {{biography}} of Whitehead by Victor Lowe {{is the most}} definitive presentation {{of the life of}} Whitehead. However, many details of Whitehead's life remain obscure because he left no Nachlass; his family carried out his instructions that all of his papers be destroyed after his death. Additionally, Whitehead was known for his [...] "almost fanatical belief in the right to privacy", and for writing very few personal letters of the kind that would help to gain insight on his life. [...] This led to Lowe himself remarking on the first page of Whitehead's biography, [...] "No professional biographer in <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>mind</b> would touch him." ...|$|E

However, the Red Skull used the Cosmic Cube to {{transfer}} <b>his</b> own <b>mind</b> <b>right</b> before death into Lukin's body, leaving the two men stuck together [...] "like rats in a cage".|$|R
50|$|My theory, if I {{ever had}} one, {{was that this}} show, {{broadcast}} at such a crazy time, could only be successful if it were based on one assumption: that nobody in <b>his</b> or her <b>right</b> <b>mind</b> would choose to be up at such an awful hour. If we both had to be awake so early, I thought, let's agree one thing: that it's you and me against the world. I determined to be cheerful but in a grumpy sort of way, {{with none of the}} enforced jollity so beloved of Radio 4.|$|R

She too stood silently among her companions. She has no priest to flirt with, he thought with {{conscious}} bitterness, remembering how {{he had seen her}} last. Lynch was <b>right.</b> <b>His</b> <b>mind</b> emptied of theory and courage, lapsed back into a listless peace.|$|R
500|$|Reviews for Top Hat {{were mainly}} positive. The Los Angeles Evening Herald Express praised the film, exclaiming [...] "Top Hat is the tops! With Fred Astaire dancing and singing Irving Berlin tunes! Well, one (in <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>mind)</b> couldn't ask {{for much more}} — unless, of course, {{it could be a}} couple of encores." [...] The New York Times praised the film's musical numbers, but criticized the story line, {{describing}} it as [...] "a little on the thin side," [...] but also stating that [...] "it is sprightly enough to plug those inevitable gaps between the shimmeringly gay dances."Top Hat" [...] is worth standing in line for. From the appearance of the lobby yesterday afternoon, you probably will have to." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Pacers' locker room, O'Neal and Carlisle nearly {{got into}} a fight over the coaches trying to {{restrain}} the players when they were defending themselves. Artest asked Jackson whether he thought the players would get in trouble. Jackson responded, [...] "We'll be lucky if we have a freaking job." [...] The conversation convinced an amazed Jackson and Pollard that Artest [...] "wasn't in <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>mind,</b> to ask that question". Auburn Hills police entered the locker room to make arrests, but the team rushed Artest onto the bus and refused to take him off. The police decided to protect the Pacers as they left the arena and to later contact the team after reviewing game film. Outside of the arena, there were dozens of police cruisers lining the roads out of the parking lots.|$|E

[...] "On the Other Hand" [...] was pitched to Whitley before Randy Travis released the song as a single and when Whitley's version wasn't released as a single, Travis released his in 1986, as did George Strait with [...] "Nobody in <b>His</b> <b>Right</b> <b>Mind</b> Would've Left Her".|$|E
5000|$|Land Force Commander Colonel Ioane Naivalurua called Bainimarama [...] "courageous, strong, and ... a saviour of Fiji in {{this time}} of need." [...] But Methodist Church {{spokesman}} Rev. Iliesa Naivalu strongly rebuked him for calling on soldiers to switch churches if their minister preached against the army. [...] "No leader in <b>his</b> <b>right</b> frame of <b>mind</b> urges his people to change their churches simply because of a Bill," [...] he said on 29 June. [...] "To do so is a breach of an individual's constitutional right to express their faith by joining a church of their choice." [...] He accused Bainimarama of lacking wisdom and respect, the true foundation of sound leadership.|$|R
6000|$|The {{old man had}} {{satisfied}} {{himself that}} Bartley had absconded in <b>his</b> own rascally <b>right</b> <b>mind,</b> and he accepted with tacit grimness {{the theory of the}} detectives that he had not gone to Europe alone. He paid back the money which Bartley had borrowed from Halleck, and he set himself as patiently as he could to bear with Marcia's obstinacy. It was a mania which must be indulged for the time, and he could only trust to Atherton to keep him advised concerning her. When he offered her money at parting, she hesitated. But she finally took it, saying, [...] "Bartley will pay it back, every cent, as soon as he gets home. And if," [...] she added, [...] "he doesn't get back soon, I will take some other boarders and pay it myself." ...|$|R
60|$|Chatterer the Red Squirrel is a scamp {{himself and}} not to be trusted. Nobody in the Green Forest or on the Green Meadows trusts him. And people who cannot be trusted {{themselves}} never trust any one else. Chatterer never does. He is always suspicious. So when Peter Rabbit had said good-by and started for the dear Old Briar-patch without knowing where Chatterer's new house was, Chatterer had made up <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>right</b> away that Peter would never be satisfied until he knew, or thought he knew, where that new house was.

2500|$|The noted American author John Dos Passos {{joined the}} {{committee}} and wrote its 127-page official review of the case: Facing the Chair: Story of Americanization of Two Foreignborn Workmen. Dos Passos concluded it [...] "barely possible" [...] that Sacco might have committed murder {{as part of a}} class war, but that the soft-hearted Vanzetti was clearly innocent. [...] "Nobody in <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>mind</b> who was planning such a crime would take a man like that along," [...] Dos Passos wrote of Vanzetti. After the executions, the Committee continued its work, helping to gather material that eventually appeared as The Letters of Sacco and Vanzetti.|$|E
2500|$|Both wrote {{dozens of}} letters asserting their innocence, insisting {{they had been}} framed because they were anarchists. Their conduct in prison {{consistently}} impressed guards and wardens. In 1927, the Dedham jail chaplain wrote {{to the head of}} an investigatory commission that he had seen no evidence of guilt or remorse on Sacco's part. Vanzetti impressed fellow prisoners at Charlestown State Prison as a bookish intellectual, incapable of committing any violent crime. Novelist John Dos Passos, who visited both men in jail, observed of Vanzetti, [...] "nobody in <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>mind</b> who was planning such a crime would take a man like that along." [...] Vanzetti developed his command of English {{to such a degree that}} journalist Murray Kempton later described him as [...] "the greatest writer of English in our century to learn his craft, do his work, and die all in the space of seven years." ...|$|E
2500|$|His grief did not hinder his performance, however, or his output, {{as he went}} on {{to release}} 11 {{straight}} No.1 hits, starting with [...] "Nobody in <b>His</b> <b>Right</b> <b>Mind</b> Would've Left Her" [...] in 1986 and ending with [...] "Ace in the Hole" [...] in 1989. The singles spanned four albums, including #7, Ocean Front Property in 1987, If You Ain't Lovin' You Ain't Livin' in 1988 and 1989's Beyond the Blue Neon, all of which reached the number one spot on country album charts. Ocean Front Property was the first country album to ever debut at No.1 on the charts by any artist. The streak included such songs as [...] "Ocean Front Property", [...] "All My Ex's Live in Texas", [...] "Famous Last Words of a Fool" [...] and [...] "Baby Blue". Strait finished the decade by winning the CMA Entertainer of the Year award in 1989. A year later, he won the award again.|$|E
60|$|Besides, if his {{customers}} {{at any time}} paid him money, let them look to themselves, and to their Acquitances, for he would usually attempt to call for that payment again, specially if he {{thought that there was}} hopes of making a prize thereby, and then to be sure if they could not produce good and sufficient ground of the payment, a hundred to one but they payed it again. Sometimes the honest Chapman would appeal to his servants for proof of the payment of money, but they were trained up by him to say after <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>right</b> or wrong: so that, relief that way, he could get none.|$|R
60|$|Now it just {{happened}} that Old Man Coyote had started to cross the Green Meadows right {{at the foot of}} the hill just as the barrel started down. Of course, he heard the noise and looked up to see what it meant. When he saw that barrel rushing right down at him, it frightened him so that he just gave one yelp and started for the Old Pasture like a gray streak. He gave Peter a chance to see just how fast he can run, and Peter made up <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>right</b> then that he never would run a race with Old Man Coyote.|$|R
6000|$|So, {{leaving the}} women {{similarly}} engaged within, the two gentlemen walked away, each occupied {{with his own}} thought, and silent for a considerable space. [...] "I must set this matter right," [...] thought honest George [...] "as she loves him still--I must set <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>right</b> about the other woman." [...] And with this charitable thought, the good fellow began to tell more at large what Bows had said to him regarding Miss Bolton's behaviour and fickleness, and he described how the girl was no better than a little light-minded flirt; and, perhaps, he exaggerated the good-humour and contentedness which he had himself, as he thought, witnessed in her behaviour in the scene with Mr. Huxter.|$|R
60|$|How any man in <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>mind</b> {{could bring}} himself to defile the grave of a shamefully abused and defenceless girl with these {{baseless}} fabrications, this manufactured filth, is inconceivable. How any man, in <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>mind</b> or out of it, could sit down and coldly try to persuade anybody to believe it, or listen patiently to it, or, indeed, do anything but scoff at it and deride it, is astonishing.|$|E

It is astonishing to me that Kingsley should have spoken of him as a man well fitted to advance science. He laughed to scorn the idea that a mathematician, such as Whewell, could judge, as I maintained he could, of Goethe's views on light. He thought it a most ridiculous thing that any one should care whether a glacier moved a little quicker or a little slower, or moved at all. As far as I could judge, I never met a man with a mind so ill adapted for scientific research.|$|R
5000|$|However, the pithy, elegant Maximes, (maxims) {{had no such}} fate. The author made {{frequent}} alterations and {{additions to}} them during his life and a few were added after his death.

La Rochefoucauld reflects on the conduct and motives of mankind, {{from the point of}} view of a man of the world who intends not to sugar-coat his observations.

He looked over his shoulder, and what he saw helped him to make up his mind in a hurry.
