However, the Government of Mongolia declared {{an interest in the}} skeleton and obtained a restraining order preventing the sale being completed. This was because the Constitution of Mongolia declares that all dinosaur fossils are [...] "culturally significant" [...] and can not be removed from Mongolia without government consent.

The United States Attorney's Office {{filed a complaint with the}} court with regard to the false import documents and to seize the skeleton with the aim of repatriating it to Mongolia.|$|R
2500|$|To aid {{development}} of such programs, and the re-use of extant code, Xcode 6 offers a semi-automated system that builds and maintains a bridging header to expose Objective-C code to Swift. This {{takes the form}} of an additional header file that simply defines or imports all of the Objective-C symbols that are needed by the project's Swift code. At that point, Swift can refer to the types, functions, and variables <b>declared</b> in those <b>imports</b> as though they were written in Swift. Objective-C code can also use Swift code directly, by importing an automatically maintained header file with Objective-C declarations of the project's Swift symbols. For instance, an Objective-C file in a mixed project called [...] "MyApp" [...] could access Swift classes or functions with the code #import [...] "MyApp-Swift.h". Not all symbols are available through this mechanism, however—use of Swift-specific features like generic types, non-object optional types, sophisticated enums, or even Unicode identifiers may render a symbol inaccessible from Objective-C.|$|R
40|$|As {{the global}} {{epicentre}} of wildlife trade, Hong Kong {{plays an important}} role in the preservation or demise of biodiversity, including species found continents away. If mismanaged, legal trade in threatened species can lead to unsustainable exploitation. Inaccurate and incomplete trade records from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) undermine the regulation of this trade. We examine the trade of hippo (Hippopotamus amphibius) teeth to illustrate the extent of mismatched data between key trading nations. More than 90 % of global hippo teeth trade is imported to, and re-exported from, Hong Kong. Of that imported, 76 % originated in Tanzania or Uganda, but there are notable disparities in declared trade volumes. In most transactions, Hong Kong <b>declares</b> more volume <b>imported</b> than the volume declared exported by Uganda. Overall, Hong Kong has reported the import of 3, 176 kg more hippo teeth than declared exported by Tanzania. This indicates that actual trade levels may exceed internationally agreed quotas. In total, over 14, 000 kg of hippo teeth is unaccounted for between Uganda and Hong Kong, representing more than 2, 700 individual hippos – 2 % of the global population. This gross discordance in trade data undermines regulatory measures and challenges the persistence of hippo populations in Africa...|$|R
40|$|Global trade {{data are}} {{collected}} worldwide and made available by national statistical services {{as well as}} dedicated data providers. JRC has carried out a support task to IAEA to identify main trade data sources and explore uses for safeguards. In this context a software tool has been developed in support to nuclear trade analysis. The tool, called The Big Table (TBT), allows IAEA¿s analysts to search control lists, identify items of interest to trade-related case studies, and link these to technical documentation and descriptors needed to retrieve global trade data. A distinguishing trait of TBT is that it enables searching in an ¿inter-related way¿ a collection of reference documents for export controls on nuclear and nuclear-related items. Reference documents include: regulatory documents, technical handbooks and the Harmonized System, the taxonomy of goods by the World Customs Organization used by traders to <b>declare</b> exports and <b>imports</b> to customs. By inter-related search it is meant that semantically related items listed in different documents of TBT¿s collection are put in correspondence by ad hoc correspondence tables. In this way, any document in the collection can be taken as starting point for a search, and retrieve complementary perspectives on items given other relevant documents. TBT can serve a variety of tasks and communities underpinning export controls, including the rating of items by licensing authorities and commodity identification for customs controls. JRC.

40|$|Since the {{creation}} of the United States, New York has been an advocate for human rights in a nation where slavery was protected by the Constitution. In 1785, a bill for the immediate abolition of slavery passed in the Legislature, but failed in the Council of Revision as the Assembly insisted on a provision denying freed slaves the right to vote (Gordan, III, 2006, p. 9). Just three years later, in 1788, the Legislature passed “An Act Concerning Slaves ” which prohibited the sale of slaves brought into or exported from New York, punishable by one hundred pounds per offense as well as <b>declaring</b> those slaves <b>imported</b> shall be free (Du Bois, 1896 / 1970, p 1). Eleven years later a statute guaranteed eventual freedom to all children born slaves after July 4, 1799 and provided a mechanism for immediate manumission of slaves. After several more enactments, New York recognized slave marriages, and the right of slaves to own property, and protected them against forced expatriation. The Legislature provided for the emancipation of slaves born prior to 1799, and allowed non-residents to enter New York with their slaves for up to nine months. In 1841, New York repealed the portion of the statute allowing non-residents to enter with slaves, thereby becoming an entirely slave-free state (Gordan, III, 2006, p. 9). Perhaps New York’s greatest stand against slavery came in 1860 when in Lemmon v Peopl...|$|R
40|$|Model-driven {{development}} (MDD) {{has become}} a promising trend in software engineering {{for a number of}} reasons. Models as the key artifacts help the developers to abstract from irrelevant details, focus on important aspects of the underlying domain, and thus master complexity. As software systems grow, models may grow as well and finally become possibly too large to be developed and maintained in a comprehensible way. In traditional software development, the complexity of software systems is tackled by dividing the system into smaller cohesive parts, so-called components, and let distributed teams work on each concurrently. The question arises how this strategy can be applied to model-driven development. The overall aim of this thesis is to develop a formalized modularization concept to enable the structured and largely independent development of interrelated models in larger teams. To this end, this thesis proposes component models with explicit export and import interfaces where exports declare what is provided while <b>imports</b> <b>declare</b> what it needed. Then, composite model can be connected by connecting their compatible export and import interfaces yielding so-called composite models. Suitable to composite models, a transformation approach is developed which allows to describe changes over the whole composition structure. From the practical point of view, this concept especially targets models based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF). In the modeling community, EMF has evolved to a very popular framework which provides modeling and code generation facilities for Java applications based on structured data models. Since graphs are a natural way to represent the underlying structure of visual models, the formalization is based on graph transformation. Incorporated concepts according to distribution heavily rely on distributed graph transformation introduced by Taentzer. Typed graphs with inheritance and containment structures are well suited to describe the essentials of EMF models. However, they also induce a number of constraints like acyclic inheritance and containment which have to be taken into account. The category-theoretical foundation in this thesis allows for the precise definition of consistent composite graph transformations satisfying all inheritance and containment conditions. The composite modeling approach is shown to be coherent with the development of tool support for composite EMF models and composite EMF model transformation...|$|R
