5|$|The Scilly Isles {{supported}} Charles I {{during the}} English Civil War, {{and after a}} short period in Parliamentary control rebelled in favour of Charles in 1648. The Royalists on Tresco appeared to have believed that King Charles's Castle was a critical <b>defensive</b> <b>point</b> {{on the island and}} probably built new earthwork defences around the castle to defend it against an attack from the land. It is possible, however, that these defences instead date from around 1627, and were built by the King's engineer, Bernard Johnson. During this period the castle was given its current name.|$|E
5|$|First Russian forces {{crossed the}} border in Ukraine {{on the night of}} 18/19 May 1792. The Russians in that theater would {{encounter}} significantly more resistance than they expected, as Commonwealth's top commanders, Prince Poniatowski and Kościuszko were stationed there. Kościuszko joined Prince Poniatowski near Janów on 29 May. The Crown Army was judged too weak to oppose the four columns of enemy armies advancing into West Ukraine and began a fighting withdrawal to the western side of the Southern Bug River, towards Lubar and Połonne, with Kośiuszko commanding the rear guard. Poniatowski, in face of a significant numerical inferiority of his forces, and promised reinforcements by King Poniatowski, decided to abandon Ukraine and move to Volhynia, where Połonne was to be fortified as a major <b>defensive</b> <b>point,</b> and where Lubomirski was tasked with gathering supplies.|$|E
25|$|The site is {{enclosed}} by a stone wall, {{interrupted by a}} large, paved entrance facing south, uphill towards Hameldown. The wall would have been substantial – in some places its ruins are more than 15 feet (4.5 m) in thickness. However, the site is of limited value from a <b>defensive</b> <b>point</b> of view, so {{the assumption is that}} the wall was to keep livestock in, and predators out. It is possible that it was topped by a hedge or fence. On the northern edge of the site is the start of the West Webburn, which was the main water source for the settlement.|$|E

25|$|The {{crash in}} Belgium {{of a light}} plane {{carrying}} two German officers {{with a copy of}} the then-current invasion plan forced Hitler to scrap the plan and search for an alternative. The final plan for Fall Gelb (Case Yellow) had been suggested by General Erich von Manstein, then serving as Chief of Staff to Gerd von Rundstedt, but had been initially rejected by the German General Staff. It proposed a deep penetration further south of the original route which would take advantage of the speed of the unified Panzer divisions to separate and encircle the opposing forces. It had the virtue of being unlikely (from a <b>defensive</b> <b>point</b> of view), as the Ardennes was heavily wooded and implausible as a route for a mechanized invasion. It also had the considerable virtue of not having been intercepted by the Allies (for no copies were being carried about), and of being dramatic, which seems to have appealed to Hitler.|$|E
25|$|Fort de Kock was {{established}} by Captain Bouer in 1825 during the governorship of Baron Hendrik Merkus de Kock {{when he was the}} commander of der Troepen and vice governor of the Dutch Indies. It was simply called the Sterrenschans (star-shaped sconce) because of its shape, but later was named Fort de Kock after de Kock himself. The main purpose of the fortification was to provide a <b>defensive</b> <b>point</b> to protect the five adat villages surrounding the hill against possible rising from the padris, especially since the start of a decade long Padri War. The Dutch were given the permission to built the fort on Bukit Jirek ("Jirek Hill") by the adats. The adats includes all indigenous, pre-Islamic religious practices and social traditions in local custom. The Padri movement, who had formed during the early 19th century, sought to suppress the adats because the adats are viewed as unislamic. After years of conflict, the Dutch and the adats won the war.|$|E

He returned his first career interception 45-yards for his first career touchdown against the Arizona Rattlers. Smith missed {{a portion of the}} game after taking a knee to the helmet in Houston. He had his first catch of the season against the Oklahoma Wranglers. He had his second career interception and returned a blocked extra point attempt for the first two-point <b>defensive</b> <b>point</b> after try in league history at the New York Dragons. Smith made his first-career start at Defensive Specialist (DS) intercepting an Andy Kelly pass late in the game, leading to a game-tying field goal in a game that the San Jose SaberCats won in overtime against the Nashville Kats. He recorded career-highs of four catches for 86 yards and added his fourth career interception against the Florida Bobcats. Smith had the first two missed field goal returns of his career against the Thunderbears..|$|E

25|$|Following the {{construction}} of Fort de Kock on Bukit Jirek, the Dutch built another set of forts to increase control of the region.

The increasing <b>defensive</b> <b>points</b> allow the Dutch to develop a new colonial government with government offices, a cemetery complex, a market, schools, and recreation area.

A <b>defensive</b> <b>point</b> guard will also pressure opponents in passing lanes in an attempt to generate steals and scoring opportunities for his own team.|$|E

The weapon contained around 8 gal of fuel, that was discharged within a second, to a second and a half, producing a flame with a 15 yd range.

The French III and IV corps, under Vandamme, reached Paris at noon on 29 June, by the Lagny road: they passed through the capital, and occupied the heights of Montrouge on the south side.|$|R
50|$|The {{tower is}} an {{excellent}} observation post with uninterrupted views both upriver to Granagh Castle and downriver beyond Reginald's Tower.

Although aerial photography had been useful, it was unable to efficiently identify the enemy's strong <b>defensive</b> <b>points.</b> Primitive communications also meant that the British commanders had been unable {{to keep in touch with}} each other and the attack became disorganised which disrupted the delivery of supplies. On 12 March, German forces commanded by Crown Prince Rupprecht, launched a counter-attack which failed but forced the British to use most of their artillery ammunition; the British offensive was postponed on 13 March and abandoned two days later.|$|R

It was apprehended the principal operations of the enemy would be on Long Island, the high grounds of which, {{in the neighborhood of}} Brooklyn, commanded the city. Washington saw that an able and efficient officer was needed at that place. Greene was accordingly stationed there, with a division of the army.
