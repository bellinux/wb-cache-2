5|$|Although he venerated Scott's {{writing skill}} {{and use of}} history as backdrop, Balzac worked to more {{accurately}} depict the turbulence {{of the human heart}} – and its effect on history. He considered Scott's view of women unrefined, and believed this led to a stale representation of <b>human</b> <b>behavior</b> as a result. In Les Chouans, Balzac places the romance of Montauran and Marie de Verneuil {{at the center of the}} narrative, around which all other elements revolve.|$|E
5|$|Eliminativists such as Paul and Patricia Churchland {{argue that}} folk {{psychology}} is a fully developed but non-formalized theory of <b>human</b> <b>behavior.</b> It {{is used to}} explain and make predictions about human mental states and behavior. This view {{is often referred to}} as the theory of mind or just simply theory-theory, for it is a theory which theorizes the existence of an unacknowledged theory. As a theory in the scientific sense, eliminativists maintain, folk psychology needs to be evaluated on the basis of its predictive power and explanatory success as a research program for the investigation of the mind/brain.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigated}} influence on plant bioelectric potential by basic <b>human</b> <b>behaviors.</b> We analyzed four basic <b>human</b> <b>behaviors</b> such as touching the plant, opening the door, approaching {{the plant and}} turning on the lighting. As a result, the special response of bioelectric potential were influenced by each behavior. Bioelectric potential shows the impulse responses due to the behavior. Therefore we tried to learn and recognize <b>human</b> <b>behaviors</b> by extracting a characteristic from plant bioelectric potential. The method to recognize basic <b>human</b> <b>behaviors</b> that we propose uses a low level ingredient of cepstrum of plant bioelectric potential. Some data didn't recognize correctly because of individual difference of <b>human</b> <b>behaviors,</b> however, F-measure became an average of 0. 76. It shows that the proposal method may be effective way to recognize basic <b>human</b> <b>behaviors</b> from plant bioelectric potential. 出版者照会後に全文公...|$|R
30|$|We {{describe}} {{a method that}} can detect specific <b>human</b> <b>behaviors,</b> such as running and meeting, even within crowded sequences. Although tracking all human objects in a crowded scene is a difficult problem, it could be possible to detect specific <b>human</b> <b>behaviors</b> by searching for a certain unique feature value from major normal feature values. The trajectory of a moving person contains rich information about the person's behaviors, such as velocity or travel distance, so we used this trajectory for recognizing <b>human</b> <b>behaviors.</b> No previous technology has recognized <b>human</b> <b>behaviors</b> based on their trajectory in crowded scenes.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose that}} many <b>human</b> <b>behaviors</b> can be {{accurately}} {{described as a}} set of dynamic models (e. g., Kalman filters) sequenced together by a Markov chain. We then use these dynamic Markov models to recognize <b>human</b> <b>behaviors</b> from sensory data and to predict <b>human</b> <b>behaviors</b> over a few seconds time. To test the power of this modeling approach, we report an experiment in which we were able to achieve 95 % accuracy at predicting automobile drivers’ subsequent actions from their initial preparatory movements...|$|R

These views gained him some critics, as he was seen as a priest who had abandoned religion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the context}} of {{philosophy}} of mind, the problem of free will takes on renewed intensity. This is certainly the case, at least, for materialistic determinists. According to this position, natural laws completely determine {{the course of the}} material world. Mental states, and therefore the will as well, would be material states, which means <b>human</b> <b>behavior</b> and decisions would be completely determined by natural laws. Some take this reasoning a step further: people cannot determine by themselves what they want and what they do. Consequently, they are not free.|$|E
5|$|Little says Rosenberg was {{influenced}} by Erich Fromm, George Albee, and George Miller to adopt a community focus in his work, moving away from clinical psychological practice. The central ideas influencing this shift by Rosenberg were that: (1) individual mental health depends on the social structure of a community (Fromm), (2) therapists alone are unable to meet the psychological needs of a community (Albee), and (3) knowledge about <b>human</b> <b>behavior</b> will increase if psychology is freely given to the community (Miller).|$|E

5|$|Some critics {{consider}} Balzac's writing exemplary of naturalism—a more pessimistic {{and analytical}} form of realism, {{which seeks to}} explain <b>human</b> <b>behavior</b> as intrinsically linked with the environment.

Zola indicated that whilst the Romantics saw the world through a colored lens, the naturalist sees through a clear glass—precisely the sort of effect Balzac attempted to achieve in his works.|$|E
5|$|Southern Africa {{consists}} of many cave sites, {{most of which}} show very punctuated starts and stops in stone tool technology. Research in southern Africa has been continuous and quite standardized, allowing for reliable comparisons between sites in the region.

5|$|Symbolic {{behavior}} is, perhaps, one of {{the most}} difficult aspects of modern <b>human</b> <b>behavior</b> to distinguish archaeologically. When searching for evidence of symbolic behavior in the MSA, there are three lines of evidence that can be considered: direct evidence reflecting concrete examples of symbols; indirect evidence reflecting behaviors that would have been used to convey symbolic thought; and technological evidence reflecting the tools and skills that would have been used to produce art. Direct evidence is difficult to find beyond 40ka, and indirect evidence is essentially intangible, thus technological evidence is the most fruitful of the three.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the framework of}} our intelligent video production, which has functions for multimodal data acquisition, accumulation to a database, and intelligent video editing. Since multimodal approach is most effective and promising for semi-/automatic video production, we first developed a prototype of multimodal acquisition system and database in which <b>human</b> <b>behaviors</b> are recorded in a multimodal way. By consulting it, we can intensively investigate the <b>human</b> <b>behaviors</b> in typical situations. We are developing algorithms for detecting typical <b>human</b> <b>behaviors,</b> for example, deictic movements. The behaviors are good keys to detecting the "focus", which means the most important portions to be recorded and to {{be presented to the}} audience. Thus, intelligent video production becomes possible by these intelligent processes. We briefly introduce, in this paper, our idea for detecting the focus of <b>human</b> <b>behaviors</b> in videotaping and emphasizing it. 1 Introduction Movies, TV programs, [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The pseudoscience of {{evolutionary}} psychology purports to explain <b>human</b> <b>behaviors</b> {{by reference to}} an ancestral environment (essentially, a hunting-gathering way of life) in which we evolved. Contemporary <b>human</b> <b>behaviors</b> are allegedly governed directly by genes that reflect adaptation to this environment by natural selection. However, the evolutionary process is much more complex than this reductionist approach implies, and adaptation cannot involve the fine-tuning of structures or behaviors within individuals or species: natural selection can only affect entire organisms, not their components. Similarly, genetic processes are too complex to admit this simplistic view. Instead, our flexible, complex <b>human</b> <b>behaviors</b> probably represent an emergent acquisition...|$|R

5|$|The humanists {{believed}} {{that it is important}} to transcend to the afterlife with a perfect mind and body, which could be attained with education. The purpose of humanism was to create a universal man whose person combined intellectual and physical excellence and who was capable of functioning honorably in virtually any situation. This ideology was referred to as the uomo universale, an ancient Greco-Roman ideal. Education during the Renaissance was mainly composed of ancient literature and history as it was thought that the classics provided moral instruction and an intensive understanding of <b>human</b> <b>behavior.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{theories}} proposed regarding the development of modern <b>human</b> <b>behavior,</b> but in recent years the mosaic approach has been the most favored perspective in regards to the MSA, especially when taken in consideration with the archaeological evidence.

5|$|A {{series of}} {{innovations}} {{have been documented}} by 170–160,000 {{years ago at the}} site of Pinnacle Point 13B on the southern Cape coast of South Africa. This includes the oldest confirmed evidence for the utilization of ochre and marine resources in the form of shellfish exploitation for food. Based on his analysis of the MSA bovid assemblage at Klasies, Milo reports MSA people were formidable hunters and that their social behavior patterns approached those of modern humans. Deacon maintains that the management of plant food resources through deliberate burning of the veld to encourage the growth of plants with corms or tubers in the southern Cape during the Howiesons Poort (c. 70–55 ka) is indicative of modern <b>human</b> <b>behavior.</b> A family basis to foraging groups, color symbolism and the reciprocal exchange of artifacts and the formal organization of living space are, he suggests, further evidence for modernity in the MSA.|$|E
5|$|Archeological {{data from}} the Late Pleistocene in South Asia is vital for our {{understanding}} of the evolution of modern <b>human</b> <b>behavior</b> and how early humans spread through the Old World. In prehistoric times, the movement of human and faunal populations from the Indian mainland to Sri Lanka and back took place over the continental shelf shared between the two countries, which from around 7000 BP has been submerged below the Palk Strait and Adam's Bridge. Being only around 70 m deep, significant reductions in sea level due to climate change, in at least the past 500,000 years, periodically caused the continental shelf to be exposed, forming a land bridge approximately 100km wide and 50km long.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{abstract}} thinking {{can be seen}} in the archaeological record as early as the Acheulean-Middle Stone Age transition, approximately 300,000-250,000 years ago. This transition involves a shift in stone tool technology from Mode 2, Acheulean tools, to Mode 3 and 4, which include blades and microliths. The manufacture of these tools requires planning and the understanding of how striking a stone will produce different flaking patterns. This requires abstract thought, one of the hallmarks of modern <b>human</b> <b>behavior.</b> The shift from large cutting tools in the Acheulian to smaller and more diversified toolkits in the MSA represents a better cognitive and conceptual understanding of flintknapping, as well as the potential functional effects of distinct tool types.|$|E

5|$|Nonviolent Communication {{is based}} on the idea that all human beings have the {{capacity}} for compassion and only resort to violence or behavior that harms others when they do not recognize more effective strategies for meeting needs. Habits of thinking and speaking that lead to the use of violence (psychological and physical) are learned through culture. NVC theory supposes all <b>human</b> <b>behavior</b> stems from attempts to meet universal human needs and that these needs are never in conflict. Rather, conflict arises when strategies for meeting needs clash. NVC proposes that if people can identify their needs, the needs of others, and the feelings that surround these needs, harmony can be achieved.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} expand into new environments {{throughout}} Africa and, ultimately, the world, displays a level of adaptability and, consequently, innovativeness that is often seen as characteristic of behavioral modernity. This, however, {{is not the only}} evidence of innovativeness that can be seen in early Homo sapiens. The development of new, regionally relevant tools, such as those used for the collection of marine resources seen at Abdur, Ethiopia, Pinnacle Point Cave, South Africa, and Blombos Cave, South Africa. The use of fire demonstrates another innovative aspect of <b>human</b> <b>behavior</b> when it is used in order to create stronger tools, such as the heated silcrete at Blombos, Howiesons Poort and Still Bay, and the heat treated bone tools from Still Bay.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the method for modeling human figure locomotions with emotions. Fourier expansions of experimental data of actual <b>human</b> <b>behaviors</b> {{serve as a}} basis from which the method can interpolate or extrapolate the human locomotions. This means, for instance, that transition from a walk to a run is smoothly and realistically performed by the method. Moreover an individual's character or mood, appearing during the <b>human</b> <b>behaviors,</b> is also extracted by the method. For example, the method gets &quot;briskness &quot; from the experimental data for a &quot;normal &quot; walk and a &quot;brisk &quot; walk. Then the &quot;brisk &quot; run is generated by the method, using another Fourier expansion of the measured data of running. The superposition of these <b>human</b> <b>behaviors</b> is shown as an efficient technique for generating rich variations of human locomotions. In addition, step-length, speed, and hip position during the locomotions are also modeled, and then interactively controlled to get a desired animation...|$|R
