500|$|When a CBC Radio {{interviewer}} {{suggested to}} Franklin that her ideas about {{peace and justice}} were not connected with what was actually happening {{in the aftermath of}} 9/11, she [...] readily agreed. [...] "Yes, you are quite right. They are totally unconnected. I have spent the best part of my life trying to put these thoughts into the stream that makes decisions, and I've been spectacularly unsuccessful. That, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> reflection on my ability in the climate of the time, not on the value of the thoughts." ...|$|E
500|$|Ward {{was very}} happy with the episode. [...] He complimented {{storyboard}} artists Muto and Sugar, saying that the former [...] "has a hilarious slapstick set-up-the-punchline kind of style of comedy" [...] and the latter [...] "is amazing at executing these super romantic, emotional goosebump-kind of feelings". He was particularly pleased with the ending, noting that [...] "I love that goose-bumps feeling in a climactic scene with music rising. In that episode you're talking about, there is that rising action toward the end, and then LSP [...] cuts in and says 'drama bomb!' {{in the middle of it}} to sort of, like, cut its legs out. Which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> lot of fun." [...] The episode was later nominated for a 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short-format Animated Program, although it did not win.|$|E
500|$|After {{reading the}} Koran and observing North Africans, {{he wrote to}} his wife, [...] "Just {{finished}} reading the Koran– a good book and interesting." [...] Patton had a keen eye for native customs and methods and wrote knowingly of local architecture; he once rated the progress of word-of-mouth rumor in Arab country at [...] a day. In spite of his regard for the Koran, he concluded, [...] "To me it seems certain that the fatalistic teachings of Mohammad and the utter degradation of women is the outstanding cause for the arrested development of the Arab... Here, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> text for some eloquent sermon on the virtues of Christianity." [...] Patton was impressed with the Soviet Union but was disdainful of Russians as [...] "drunks" [...] with [...] "no regard for human life". Later in life he also began to express growing feelings of antisemitism and anticommunism, {{as a result of his}} frequent controversies in the press.|$|E

500|$|.....that was so hard, it's just, {{and it felt}} strained, and as a result, I'm {{happy that}} I worked hard to do those, because those English {{versions}} are really good and [...] "Simple and Clean," [...] <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> really good song, and people- {{most of the people}} that know me here, they know me for that- but it's not ideal for me as a writer, to- because, actually, I changed the melodies for [...] "Simple and Clean" [...] and [...] "Hikari," [...] because when you change the language you're singing in, the same melodies don't work- and as a writer, it's just very frustrating to have, like- I wrote these melodies for Japanese words, and to have to write in English for that, it's just not right. And then, so, for this, uh, this contract with Island Def Jam, in the beginning I separated it to this English language album, and I don't do Japanese translations. I just, my integrity as an artist just would not take that, could not take that." ...|$|E
500|$|The band's {{music is}} {{characterized}} by a metal sound, and the screamed vocals of frontman Josh Scogin. Journalists have frequently referred to the music as [...] "chaotic"; Allmusic writer Alex Henderson described it as a [...] "dense, clobbering sledgehammer", while Brian Shultz of Alternative Press called it [...] "manically pounding, distortion-soaked exercises of catharsis". The Chariot has often been labeled a metalcore band. However, the music generally defies genre standards like melodic/abrasive dynamics and harmonizing vocals; it wouldn't leave room for the [...] "nonstop firestorm of exploding drums, heaving guitars, and visceral shrieking," [...] as Allmusic writer Corey Apar put it. The band utilizes time changes and start-stop shifts, and typically write very short songs. Some journalists believe the music is challenging and an acquired taste. In interviews, Josh Scogin has described the band as “heavy punk rock”, doing away with genres and subgenres, and has also debunked many of these labels. “Sometimes people refer to us as mathcore, which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> very incorrect statement, because I feel like that’s a very pre-calculated, ‘this is weird because this time signature doesn’t go with this time…’. It’s very planned out. We’re not that smart.” ...|$|E
500|$|To sound a {{theme of}} unity, Lincoln in 1864 ran {{under the banner of}} the National Union Party, rather than the Republicans. At the party's {{convention}} in Baltimore in June, Lincoln was easily nominated, although there had been some talk of replacing him with a Cabinet officer or one of the more successful generals. After the convention backed Lincoln, former Secretary of War Simon Cameron offered a resolution to nominate Hamlin, but it was defeated. Johnson was nominated for vice president by C.M. Allen of Indiana with an Iowa delegate as seconder. On the first ballot, Johnson led with 200 votes to 150 for Hamlin and 108 for Dickinson. On the second ballot, Kentucky switched to vote for Johnson, beginning a stampede. Johnson was named on the second ballot with 491 votes to Hamlin's 17 and eight for Dickinson; the nomination was made unanimous. Lincoln expressed pleasure at the result, [...] "Andy Johnson, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> good man." [...] When word reached Nashville, a crowd assembled and the military governor obliged with a speech contending his selection as a Southerner meant that the rebel states had not actually left the Union.|$|E

500|$|In the media, Jack is {{described}} as both the [...] "first openly gay companion" [...] and as a [...] "hunky bisexual". Jack's notability {{is largely due to}} his mainstream representation of a bisexual man in science fiction television, for whom sexual identity is [...] "matter-of-fact", and not an issue. The ordinariness with which Jack's orientation is regarded within Doctor Who embodies part of a political statement about changing societal views of homosexuality. The distinct flexibility of Jack's sexuality contributed directly towards the character's popularity and public interest. The overtness of Jack's sexuality broke new grounds, the labels [...] "pansexual" [...] and [...] "omnisexual" [...] being applied to the character on occasion. In [...] "The Parting of the Ways", Jack kissed both Rose and the Doctor on the lips, the latter being the first same-sex kiss {{in the history of the}} program. Despite the boldness of the first lesbian, gay or bisexual character in the series' run, there has been very little uproar about the character, although there was some controversy at the time of Jack's introduction. Speculating, Barrowman tries to link Jack's popularity with this portrayal, noting [...] "I think audiences just get Jack because he's honest ... to finally see a character who doesn't care who he flirts with, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> bit refreshing." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{revealed}} in a flashback in the episode that Smithers was briefly {{married to a}} woman, but the two split up when he devoted too much time to his boss Mr. Burns. Smithers's relationship with Mr. Burns {{has long been a}} running joke on The Simpsons. His sexual orientation has often come into question, with some fans claiming he is a [...] "Burns-sexual" [...] and only attracted to his boss, while others maintain that he is, without a doubt, gay. Matthew Henry wrote in the book Leaving Springfield that this episode is [...] "perhaps the best" [...] example of an attempt to portray an actual gay lifestyle on the show. Henry added that the flashback is a [...] "wonderfully rendered parody of scenes from two of Tennessee Williams's most famous plays, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and A Streetcar Named Desire. To fully appreciate it, one must know something of not only the two plays cited but also of Williams himself, of his own struggles with both heterosexual and homosexual desires {{and the way in which}} these struggles were incorporated into his art. The creators of The Simpsons offer what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> perfect parallel for the relationship between Smithers and Mr. Burns by combining Williams's two most notable male characters and their defining characteristics: the suppressed homosexual desire of Brick and desperate dependence of Stanley." ...|$|E
500|$|Before Megan Mullally {{was given}} the role of Karen, she had {{previously}} been cast as a series regular on sitcoms such as The Ellen Burstyn Show, My Life and Times, and Rachel Gunn. Mullally guest starred on many other shows, including Ned & Stacey, on which she first worked with Messing. Mullally informed her agent {{that she did not}} want to do any more sitcoms or auditions for sitcoms, during the time that Will & Grace came around. [...] "Because my feeling was, like, Look, I've done it. It's not clicking. It's not for me. But he [...] was always arguing the point that the right thing hadn't come along yet." [...] She initially auditioned for the role of Grace, but admitted that {{she did not want to}} audition for the part of Karen. When asked about Karen's voice, Mullally revealed that the voice was an [...] "instinctive thing". She also said, [...] "...I think it was just a feeling that I had that it would be better for the pace of the show and it would be funnier in some way, but I didn't know why. Karen has a lot of joy, even when she's in a bad mood. She's pretty much happy with who she is, and that is something <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> great thing to play, because the character of Karen could have been very unlikeable, and I think she's likeable because she has joy and she can be very childlike." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of her {{exposure}} as a CIA operative, Mrs. Wilson testified: [...] "I could no longer perform the work for which I had been highly trained."

2500|$|At {{his first}} press conference as President-elect, Obama was {{questioned}} by reporters {{as to which}} breed the family was looking to acquire; he replied, [...] "We have two criteria {{that have to be}} reconciled. One is that Malia is allergic, so it has to be hypoallergenic. There are a number of breeds that are hypoallergenic. On the other hand, our preference would be to get a shelter dog, but, obviously, a lot of shelter dogs are mutts like me. So – so whether we're {{going to be able to}} balance those two things, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> pressing issue on the Obama household." ...|$|E

In Moore's opinion, [...] "Tulisa has been branded by the media as a chav and therefore almost anything {{can be said about}} her". Tulisa herself also thought that her inferior reputation led her to the situation, saying, [...] "Part of it <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> class thing.

[...] CBS News executive editor Steve Capus argued that [...] "given the number of sports overruns and out-and-out pre-emptions, {{it would be better}} for us as a news organization to come up with what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> smarter, 24-hour approach to covering the world, and making sure we've got all the bases covered." ...|$|E

So I try not to limit myself, or put myself in a category, or... be the architect of my own jail." [...] Shakira has frequently stated she is inspired by oriental music and Indian music, which influenced many of her earlier works. She has also been influenced by her Arabian heritage, which was a major inspiration for her breakthrough world hit [...] "Ojos Así". She told Portuguese TV, [...] "Many of my movements belong to Arab culture." [...] She also cites her parents as having been major contributors to her musical style. She is also strongly influenced by Andean music and South American folk music, using her native instrumentation for her Latin dance-pop songs.|$|E

2500|$|The verb [...] "Wyatting" [...] {{appeared}} in some blogs and music magazines {{to describe the}} practice of playing unusual tracks, in particular songs from Wyatt's album Dondestan, on a pub jukebox to annoy the other pub goers. Wyatt was quoted in 2006 in The Guardian as saying [...] "I think it's really funny" [...] and [...] "I'm very honoured {{at the idea of}} becoming a verb." [...] When asked if he would ever try it himself, he said: [...] "I don't really like disconcerting people, but even when I try to be normal I disconcert anyway."

[...] It is not a ‘hobby’, in the sense of something quite different from one’s work, taken up as a relief-outlet. The invention of languages is the foundation. The ‘stories’ were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse. To me a name comes ﬁrst and the story follows. I should have preferred to write in ‘Elvish’. But, of course, such a work as The Lord of the Rings has been edited and only as much ‘language’ has been left in as I thought would be stomached by readers. (I now ﬁnd that many would have liked more.) [...] It is to me, anyway, largely an essay in ‘linguistic aesthetic’, as I sometimes say to people who ask me ‘what is it all about’." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of {{training}} camp Tortorella promised to make changes {{to the way the}} Canucks played. He wanted to make the team tougher to play against. Some of the techniques he felt would accomplish this were hard forechecking, protecting the puck, being strong along the boards, and increasing shot blocking. The Canucks finished the 2012–13 season as the 27th ranked team in blocked shots while the Rangers finished sixth. Tortorella also said that he would use the Sedin twins to kill penalties. The Sedins had asked Vigneault to be used on the penalty kill, but he opted to keep them rested for their offensive role instead. Upon learning that they would be killing penalties Henrik Sedin said: [...] "It's something that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> big part of becoming a great player. You {{have to be on the}} ice for all situations. For us, we were counted upon to score goals, and if we didn't, then we were terrible. I think you grow as players when you play all situations." [...] Tortorella put the Canucks through a physically demanding training camp. Players were asked to run two miles in 12 minutes and were put through a series of intense skating drills. Tortorella believed he could learn about his players when they were exhausted and asked them to give a little more.|$|E
