5|$|Clouds {{typically}} cover 1% of Titan's disk, though outburst {{events have}} been observed in which the cloud cover rapidly expands {{to as much as}} 8%. One hypothesis asserts that the southern clouds are formed when heightened levels of sunlight during the southern summer generate uplift in the atmosphere, resulting in convection. This explanation is {{complicated by the fact that}} cloud formation has been observed not only after the southern summer solstice but also during mid-spring. Increased methane humidity at the south pole possibly contributes to the rapid increases in cloud size. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>summer</b> in Titan's southern hemisphere until 2010, when Saturn's orbit, which governs Titan's motion, moved Titan's northern hemisphere into the sunlight. When the seasons switch, it is expected that ethane will begin to condense over the south pole.|$|E
500|$|Ocean {{titled the}} album as a {{reference}} to grapheme-color synesthesia, a neurological phenomenon in which an individual's perception of numbers and letters {{is associated with the}} experience of colors. He discussed the phenomenon with Pharrell, who had also experienced it and similarly referenced it for the title of his side project N.E.R.D's 2008 album Seeing Sounds. West also experienced it as a youth and used it as an inspiration when creating his short film Cruel Summer in 2012. The title also alludes to the first time that Ocean fell in love, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>summer</b> and he perceived everything to be orange. Ocean's mother called it [...] "a perfect summertime album" [...] after attending a listening session.|$|E
2500|$|The emperor {{was confronted}} with a further {{uprising}} in 1114, initiated by the citizens of Cologne, who were soon joined by the Saxons and others. Initially, Henry took the fortified town of Deutz, which lay across the Rhine from Cologne. His control of Deutz allowed him to cut Cologne off from all river trade and transportation. At this point, the citizens of Cologne assembled a large force, including bowmen, and crossed the river, formed their ranks, and prepared to meet Henry's army. [...] The Cologne bowmen were able to break the armor of Henry's soldiers; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>summer,</b> the weather was sultry, and the soldiers had removed their armor to find relief from the heat. Henry subsequently withdrew, turned south, and sacked Bonn and JÃ¼lich. On his return to Deutz, he was met by Archbishop Frederick, Duke Gottfried of Lorraine, Henry of Zutphen, and Count Theodoric of Aar, Count Gerhard of Julich (William I), Lambert of Mulenarke, and Eberhard of Gandernol, who put up a stout resistance in which the latter was killed. Theodoric, Gerhard, and Lambert were taken prisoner.|$|E
