40|$|A finite-dimensional discrete-time {{distribution}} controller {{is designed}} for a class of distributed parameter systems with control inputs <b>in</b> and/or <b>on</b> <b>the</b> body. <b>The</b> <b>systems</b> are described by a partial differential equation of parabolic type.

Sufficient conditions are given for the existence of the output regulation. A practical trade-off measure is also shown between the order of the controller and the sampling interval.

50|$|Due to the {{integrated}} nature of NextGen, {{many of its}} component systems are mutually dependent on one or more other <b>systems.</b> For instance, <b>the</b> delivery of ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast) depends on ERAM because ADS-B {{requires the use of}} some ERAM functions.

The FAA pushed the Data Communications program’s start date from September 2011 to February 2012 and delayed the SWIM-segment 2 start date from 2010 to December 2012 in part due to ERAM's delay.
