25|$|In 1994, {{to add to}} its SIPS, Volvo was {{the first}} to {{introduce}} side airbags and installed them as standard equipment in all models from 1995. At the start of the 1995 model year, side impact <b>protection</b> <b>airbags</b> were standard on high trim-level Volvo 850s, and optional on other 850s. By the middle of the production year, they were standard on all 850s. In model year 1995, SIPS airbags became standard on all Volvo models.|$|R

2500|$|Safety {{features}} on the IS models ranged from multiple airbags to stability control systems. A Pre-Collision System (PCS) was the first offered in the entry-luxury performance sedan market segment. NHTSA crash test results rated the second-generation IS the maximum five stars in the Side Driver and Rollover categories, and four stars in the <b>Frontal</b> <b>Driver,</b> <b>Frontal</b> Passenger, and Side Rear Passenger categories; Insurance Institute for Highway Safety scores were [...] "Good" [...] overall score for all fourteen measured categories {{in the front and}} side impact crash tests.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{estimated}} how adding mass, in {{the form}} of a passenger, to a car crashing head-on into another car affects fatality risks to both drivers. The study distinguished the causal roles of mass and size. METHODS: Head-on crashes between 2 cars, one with a right-front passenger and the other with only a driver, were examined with Fatality Analysis Reporting System data. RESULTS: Adding a passenger to a car led to a 14. 5 % reduction in driver risk ratio (risk to one driver divided by risk to the other). To divide this effect between the individual drivers, the author developed equations that express each driver's risk as a function of causal contributions from the mass and size of both involved cars. Adding a passenger reduced a <b>driver's</b> <b>frontal</b> crash fatality risk by 7. 5 % but increased the risk to the other driver by 8. 1 %. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a passenger reduces a <b>driver's</b> <b>frontal</b> crash fatality risk but increases the risk to the driver of the other car. The findings are applicable to some single-car crashes, in which the driver risk decrease is not offset by any increase in harm to others. When all cars carry the same additional cargo, total population risk is reduced...|$|R
40|$|Every year {{approximately}} 400 000 pedestrians {{are killed}} worldwide in road related injuries where children and elderly {{are the most}} exposed age groups. The design of the front-end of a vehicle and the structural stiffness have a significant influence on the kinematics and injury risks of the pedestrian body. To create a clearance between the rigid hood structure and the hood, the hood is lifted. A lifted hood does however not provide protection over the cowl, windscreen and A-pillar areas. This study is performed at Autoliv Sverige AB and {{the purpose is to}} examine how fast the hood can be lifted 100 mm using a pedestrian <b>protection</b> <b>airbag.</b> The airbag give an extended protection while covering the cowl, windscreen and A-pillar areas. A concept generation session was performed where modifications of the current pedestrian <b>protection</b> <b>airbag,</b> for a faster hood lift, were proposed. The generated concepts proceeded to a concept screening session where the Autoliv evaluation matrix was used. The selected concepts went further to static testing where the performance of each concept was tested. The performance include the lift time of 100 mm for the most rearward section of the hood, positioning of the cushion and pressure distribution. The tests were carried out in a room temperature environment. To conclude the thesis work, one winning concept could not be obtained. Two concepts excelled themselves from all the concepts and a difference in the performances between these two concepts could not be found. In this thesis no calculations on costs such as material costs and manufacturing costs has been made. This can be the major aspect on choosing one winning concept but {{due to the fact that}} there is no time for a cost analysis in this thesis, the PPA development team will take over...|$|R
2500|$|The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) {{crash test}} results in 2001 gave the IS 300 the maximum five {{stars in the}} Side Driver and Side Rear Passenger categories, and four stars in the <b>Frontal</b> <b>Driver</b> and <b>Frontal</b> Passenger categories. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) rated the IS [...] "Good" [...] overall for frontal {{collisions}} and [...] "Good" [...] in all six measured front impact categories.|$|R
50|$|Testing in 2001 {{showed that}} steel bull bars {{could lead to}} greater risk of injury. Later studies carried out by MIRA, one of the UK's leading testing-facilities, may have proved that the latest {{development}} of a vehicle <b>Frontal</b> <b>Protection</b> System can make many 4x4 vehicles safer {{in the event of}} front-end collisions with pedestrians or cyclists. Calculations based on these tests show that if fitted to a current large 4x4 vehicle, an FPS could save lives and reduce serious pedestrian-injuries.|$|R
50|$|The gunner {{sits behind}} {{the driver and}} on the basic model has a cupola with a two-piece hatch cover opening left and right and a single day {{observation}} periscope. A standard 0.50 inch (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine gun is mounted on the forward part of the cupola and most vehicles are fitted with a shield to give limited <b>frontal</b> <b>protection</b> to the gunner. This model is known under the company designation of the 4K 4FA-G1 with its Austrian Army designation being the usMGSPz (Schützenpanzer/Überschweres MG).|$|R
50|$|This Tigr {{is used by}} the Russian Interior Ministry OMON in {{counter-terrorism}} {{operations and}} territorial defense. It is armoured, with IEC 50963-96 Class 3 side/rear protection and Class 5 <b>frontal</b> <b>protection.</b> The vehicle has accommodations for seven occupants including the driver. Early models permit the firing of personal weapons through one-way portholes in the body. In later models personal weapons can be fired through portholes in the armored glass. An automatic gun carriage can be fitted to the roof, along with radio signal jamming equipment.|$|R
50|$|The ISU-152's 90 mm of sloped frontal armor, in {{contrast}} to the SU-152's 65 mm, provided excellent <b>frontal</b> <b>protection</b> from the 75mm KwK 40 gun of the ubiquitous Panzer IV and StuG family at all but the closest ranges, while also forcing the original Tiger I, with its vaunted 88mm KwK 36 gun, to close to medium ranges in order to successfully penetrate the vehicle, negating its traditional long-range superiority and exposing more of its vulnerable flanks to the 85mm ZiS-S gun of the Soviet T-34-85.|$|R
50|$|This {{requirement}} is not specifically aimed at bullbars but does effectively prescribe requirements for their construction. ADR 42/00, {{the first version}} of this rule, applied to vehicles built from July 1988. Australian Standard AS4876.1-2002 Motor vehicle <b>frontal</b> <b>protection</b> systems Part 1: Road user protection was released in 2002, and applies construction rules to all bullbars manufactured since that date, regardless of the age of the vehicle that they are fitted to. Similar requirements for older vehicles fitted with bullbars manufactured before that Australian Standard was implemented exist only in state legislation.|$|R

50|$|The Leopard 2A7+ is {{designed}} to operate both in low intensity and high intensity conflicts. The tank's protection has been increased by modular armour; the <b>frontal</b> <b>protection</b> has been improved with a dual-kit on the turret and hull front, while 360° protection against RPGs and mine protection increase the survivability of the tank in urban operations. The modular armour's system components were first used by Canada in Afghanistan. It can fire programmable HE munitions and the turret mounted MG3 has been replaced with a stabilized FLW 200 remotely controlled weapon station. The mobility, sustainability and situational awareness have also been improved.|$|R
25|$|Safety {{features}} on the ES 350 included dual front airbags, knee airbags, side-torso and curtain airbags, along with traction control, Vehicle Stability Control (VSC), anti-lock brakes (ABS), and electronic brake-force distribution (EBD). A pre-collision system (PCS), which incorporates a grille-mounted sensor and retracts seatbelts and triggers full braking power, was optional, and came with the distance-aware Dynamic Radar Cruise Control system. The front passenger airbag used a twin-chamber design for reduced occupant discomfort upon deployment. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) crash test results in 2007 rated the ES 350 the maximum five stars in the <b>Frontal</b> <b>Driver,</b> <b>Frontal</b> Passenger, and Side Driver categories, and four stars in the Side Rear Passenger and Rollover categories.|$|R
50|$|Most {{pedestrian}} deaths occur due to {{the traumatic}} brain injury resulting from the hard impact of the head against the stiff hood or windshield. In addition, although usually non-fatal, injuries to the lower limb (usually to the knee joint and long bones) {{are the most common}} cause of disability due to pedestrian crashes. A <b>Frontal</b> <b>Protection</b> System (FPS) is a device fitted to the front end of a vehicle to protect both pedestrians and cyclists who are involved in a front end collision with a vehicle.
