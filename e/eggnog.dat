While there, he was placed under house arrest {{for his role in}} the <b>Eggnog</b> Riot during Christmas 1826. Cadets smuggled whiskey into the academy to make <b>eggnog,</b> and more than one-third of the cadets were involved in the incident. In June 1828, Davis graduated 23rd in a class of 33.|$|E
5|$|Later, Howard {{arrives at}} Mickey's Diner and uses their {{phone to call}} home. As {{he tried to get}} a hold of Liz, he unintentionally scolds Jamie on the phone over Turbo-Man. Jamie, in turn, rebukes his father about how he never keeps his promises, and hangs up. Liz overhears the {{argument}} and becomes disappointed in her husband. Howard then encounters Myron at the diner. As they sat down and talk, Myron tells Howard about the time when his father was unable to get him a Johnny Seven OMA toy on Christmas. They hear on the KQRS radio station that the D.J. is running a Turbo-Man competition. When they get to the studio, they find out they can only win a gift certificate. They are nearly arrested, but Myron bluffs the police into backing off by threatening them with a package (which he claims is a mail bomb, unaware that it really is one). Officer Hummell tries to open it and it blows up in his face. After his car is stripped by thieves, Howard is ultimately forced to return home empty-handed. Upon seeing Ted in his house placing the star on his tree, Howard gets angry and attempts to steal the Turbo-Man doll from Ted's house that he had bought for his son Johnny (E.J. De La Pena), but changes his mind at the last moment as he could not see himself stealing from a child. He is attacked by Ted's pet reindeer but manages to lock him up but he unintentionally sets some of his stuff on fire he tires to put it out but kicks it outside the window. This commotion leads him to be caught by Ted and a distraught Liz. Liz and Jamie leave for the local Wintertainment Parade with Ted and Johnny; Howard follows, aiming to make amends. At the parade, Ted makes a pass at Liz, but after seeing what he really is, she turns him down by hitting him with a thermos of <b>eggnog.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{justice of}} the peace from Brive, Moran, arrived at Le Glandier on 15 January. Impressed by Marie, he listened with {{uncertainty}} to the family's accusations but took possession of the soup, the sugar water and the <b>eggnog</b> that Anna Brun had put aside. Then the gardener revealed that Marie had given him arsenic with which to make rat-poison paste in December as well as January. Strangely, the paste could be found all over the house, untouched by the rats.|$|E
25|$|The next day, Charles {{experienced}} leg cramps, dehydration and nausea. He was so ill {{that his}} relatives kept watch on {{him at all}} times, including a young cousin named Emma Pontier and {{a young woman who}} stayed with them by the name of Anna Brun. Marie treated him with various medicaments, especially gum arabic, which, according to her, always did her good, and which she always kept a ready supply of in her small malachite box, but to no avail. Charles deteriorated so rapidly that another physician, Dr. Massénat, was called in for consultation. He also diagnosed cholera and prescribed <b>eggnog</b> to strengthen him.|$|E
25|$|Reveille sounded at 06:05, {{along with}} gunfire, {{the sound of}} glass breaking, profanity by cadets, cries of pain, and threats to academy officials. North Barracks {{residents}} who were not drunk from the <b>eggnog</b> were appalled by the damaged property. Cadets in the South Barracks were well rested, while other cadets in the North Barracks were disheveled. Some of the cadets remained in their rooms drinking, although some appeared in parade formation despite being drunk. Worth met with superintendent Thayer after the first formation to discuss {{what had happened in}} the North Barracks the previous evening. Thayer instructed Worth to get the officers into the North Barracks and restore order.|$|E

500|$|Don Getty {{was born}} on August 30, 1933 in Westmount, Quebec, the son of Beatrice Lillian (Hampton) Getty (19101973) and Charles Ross Getty (19091974). His father {{had dropped out of}} McGill University's medical school due to the Great Depression and worked a variety of jobs—sometimes more than one at a time—to support his wife, three sons, and two daughters. [...] Getty's {{childhood}} was spent in Verdun, Toronto, Ottawa, London, and Agincourt, sharing a three-room apartment with his seven-member family in the last. [...] Returning for London in time for high school, he became an accomplished athlete (drinking <b>eggnog</b> to gain enough weight to play football) and was elected students' council president. [...] Sports were his passion, and he was an especially great fan of the Montreal Canadiens and Toronto Argonauts running back Royal Copeland.|$|E
2500|$|Anna Brun noticed Marie taking {{white powder}} from her {{malachite}} box and stirring {{it into the}} <b>eggnog.</b> When asked, Marie said it was [...] "orange-blossom sugar". But Anna's suspicions were aroused when she noticed a few white flakes floating {{on the surface of}} the <b>eggnog</b> after the patient took a few sips. She showed the glass to Dr. Massénat; he tasted the <b>eggnog</b> and experienced a burning sensation, but attributed the flakes to some ceiling plaster that may have fallen in the glass. Anna was not convinced; she put the rest of the <b>eggnog</b> in a cupboard and kept a close eye on Marie. She saw Marie stir more white powder into some soup for Charles. Again, Charles felt violently ill after a few sips. Anna took the cup of soup away and mustered enough courage to tell Charles's relatives of her suspicions.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Eggnog</b> Riot, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the Grog Mutiny, was a riot that {{took place at the}} United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, on 24–25 December 1826.

[...] Two days prior to the incident, a large quantity of whiskey was smuggled into the academy to make <b>eggnog</b> for the party, giving the riot its name.|$|E

2500|$|Alcohol {{possession}} at {{the academy}} was prohibited along with drunkenness and intoxication, both of {{which could lead to}} expulsion. Tobacco use and gambling could lead to demerits, minor incarceration, or a loss of privileges. By 1826, concern had been raised that drinking was starting to get out of hand among the 260 cadets {{at the academy}}. [...] The cadets were informed that, due to the alcohol prohibition on the site, their Christmas <b>eggnog</b> would be alcohol-free, prompting the decision to smuggle liquor into the academy.|$|E
2500|$|This time, {{when the}} chemists arrived, they {{declared}} that they {{tested positive for}} arsenic, with the <b>eggnog</b> containing enough [...] "to poison ten persons". The prosecutor took this {{as a chance to}} recoup his earlier setbacks. He declared that in view of the contradictory results, it was apparent that the court should call upon Orfila to settle the issue once and for all. Since it was the defence who originally asked for Orfila, they could not object to this request. The defence agreed, already confident of Marie's acquittal.|$|E
2500|$|At Martin's Tavern, cadets William R. Burnley (Alabama), Alexander J. Center (New York), and Samuel Alexander Roberts (Alabama) {{almost got}} into a fight with the proprietors of another tavern {{concerning}} getting whiskey back to West Point. Private James Dougan, the duty security guard, agreed to let the three cadets take a boat across the Hudson to smuggle the whiskey. The cadets planned to purchase a half-gallon of whiskey as an [...] alcohol base for the <b>eggnog</b> party that would take place in the North Barracks two nights later. Phillip St. George (Virginia) was the 24-hour duty cadet guard of the day. Burnley, Center, and Roberts successfully obtained two gallons of whiskey, smuggling them into North Barracks room No. 33. Cadet T. M. Lewis (Kentucky) also returned with a gallon of rum from Benny's Tavern to North Barracks room No. 5.|$|E
2500|$|By 04:00, {{voices from}} the floor above Hitchcock were loud enough to cause the faculty member to {{investigate}} room No. 28, where Hitchcock {{knocked on the door}} and found six cadets drunk from the <b>eggnog,</b> as well as two others sleeping on a bed. Hitchcock ordered two of the cadets back to their rooms. After they left, Hitchcock woke the two sleeping cadets and ordered them to leave as well. Then he confronted cadet James W.M. [...] "Weems" [...] Berrien (Georgia), who responded with equal force. Hitchcock read the Riot Act to the residents of the room for possessing alcohol on the premises. The captain left the room at 04:15. Berrien began verbalising his rage toward Hitchcock, which led William D.C. [...] "Billy" [...] Murdock (District of Columbia) to lead an effort to organize a riot against Hitchcock.|$|E
2500|$|Shakes are {{available}} in all U.S. McDonald's and many global markets Permanent flavors are vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate; regional or seasonal flavors include Caramel, Coffee, Cherry, <b>Eggnog</b> (during Christmas), Banana, Pumpkin (during Halloween), Strawberry Banana, Lime, Mango Raspberry, Honeycomb, Arctic Orange (sherbet), Orange Cream, Shamrock Shake (a green, spearmint Limited Time Offer shake for St. Patrick's Day), Chocolate Mint, and Rolo (available only in Canada and the UK. This flavoured milkshake was also available in the Republic of Ireland {{during the summer of}} 2007 for a limited time only). [...] In June 1975, 13 months before the celebration of the United States Bicentennial, McDonald's introduced a blueberry-flavored shake in order to advertise [...] "Red, White, and Blueberry Shakes" [...] for independence day celebrations, and lasting through August of that year. [...] The run was repeated in summer 1976, but not since. In the U.S., starting in February 2010, [...] "Triple Thick Shakes" [...] were rebranded under the McCafe name, along with the addition of whipped cream, and a cherry on top, and a significant reduction in size.

2500|$|However, he was {{reportedly}} [...] "extremely charitable" [...] to the pages {{who worked at}} the Court, and had a great love of children. For example, he gave very generous assistance and adopted thirty-three children who were victims of the German bombing of London in 1940, and left a sizable fortune to charity. When Oliver Wendell Holmes's wife died, McReynolds broke down and wept at her funeral. Holmes wrote in 1926: [...] "Poor McReynolds is, I think, a man of feeling and of more secret kindliness than he would get credit for." [...] He would often entertain at his apartment, and even passed cigarettes to his guests on occasion. He often invited people for brunch on Sunday mornings. According to William O. Douglas, [...] "On these informal occasions in his own home he was the essence of hospitality and a very delightful companion". Once, when riding to his office on a street car, a drunk got on board and fell out in the aisle. McReynolds picked him up, helped him back to his seat, and sat beside him until they reached the top of Capitol Hill, leaving him only after giving explicit instructions to the conductor. And when due to absence of more senior justices it fell on him to preside in court, [...] "he was the soul of courtesy, graciously greeting and raptly listening to the arguments by lawyers of both sexes". The public Justice McReynolds was noted for his hospitality. He entertained frequently at the Willard Hotel with guest lists of 150 people, including his fellow justices, and at an annual <b>eggnog</b> party {{which was one of the}} social highlights of the Christmas season. Alice Roosevelt, one of many friends, requested the services of his cook, Mrs. Parker, for her wedding breakfast to Nicholas Longworth.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Eggnog</b> is {{also often}} home-made, using milk, eggs, sugar and flavourings. <b>Eggnog</b> is served with {{cinnamon}} or nutmeg. While <b>eggnog</b> is often served chilled, {{in some cases}} it is served warmed, particularly on cold days (in a similar way to the way mulled wine is served warm). Distilled spirits such as whiskey or rum are sometimes added to both commercially prepared <b>eggnog</b> and homemade <b>eggnog.</b> <b>Eggnog</b> or <b>eggnog</b> flavoring may also be used in other drinks, such as coffee (e.g. an [...] "eggnog latte" [...] espresso drink) and tea, or to dessert foods such as egg-custard puddings or eggnog-flavored ice cream.|$|E

5000|$|TIME {{magazine}} {{states that}} individuals {{should be aware}} of the alcohol content of <b>eggnog,</b> from a responsible drinking perspective. When people make homemade alcoholic <b>eggnog,</b> or when they add spirits to commercially prepared <b>eggnog,</b> in some cases, the drink has a very high alcohol content; one columnist states that in his family Christmas tradition, [...] "it’s not <b>eggnog</b> unless you can set fire to it", due to high alcohol percentage. Jazz composer Charles Mingus had an <b>eggnog</b> recipe that contained enough alcohol, including 151 proof rum, to [...] "put down an elephant".|$|E
50|$|The drink is {{more popular}} in the United States in the 2000s than the United Kingdom, {{despite the fact that}} it was {{developed}} in Britain and then transplanted to the American colonies in the 1700s. As of 2014, Canadians are drinking less store-bought <b>eggnog.</b> They drank 5.3 million litres of commercial <b>eggnog</b> in 2014's Christmas period; this is less than in 1994, when they drank eight million litres. Some of the possible reasons for the decline in Canadian <b>eggnog</b> consumption could be concerns about raw eggs (for homemade <b>eggnog)</b> and health concerns, regarding the fat and sugar content of the drink.|$|E
50|$|There are {{variations}} in ingredients in different recipes. Traditional <b>eggnog</b> {{has a significant}} fat content, due {{to the use of}} cream, and a high sugar content. Ingredients vary significantly between different recipes. Alcohol used in different national and regional versions of <b>eggnog</b> include brandy, cognac, bourbon, whiskey, sherry, rum and grain alcohol. Canadian chef Heidi Fink states {{that one of the reasons}} people are making less homemade <b>eggnog</b> is that the beverage is expensive to make, due to its use of substantial quantities of cream, eggs, and spirits. Concerns about the safety of raw eggs may be another reason for the decline in homemade <b>eggnog</b> making.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Eggnog</b> has a {{polarized}} reception {{from food}} critics, chefs and consumers; Esquire states that [...] "there doesn't {{seem to be}} a middle ground on <b>eggnog.</b> You either love it or hate it". While some are enthusiastic advocates of the beverage, others are critical of its taste or consistency. The CBC states that the [...] "ancient drink can be quite divisive." [...] A writer for a major U.K. Paper, The Guardian, Andrew Shanahan described <b>eggnog</b> in a critical manner in 2006: “People rarely get it right, but even if you do it still tastes horrible. The smell is like an omelette and the consistency defies belief. It lurches around the glass like partially-sentient sludge.” [...] The New York Daily News argued against the use of <b>eggnog</b> flavouring (and other flavours, like blueberry), in coffee, calling the results [...] "Franken-coffee". Chowhound criticized Trader Joe's chocolate-flavoured <b>eggnog,</b> calling it [...] "ghastly".|$|E
50|$|<b>Eggnog</b> is {{traditionally}} consumed throughout Canada and the United States at Christmas season every year, often from American Thanksgiving {{until the end}} of the Christmas season. <b>Eggnog</b> has also gained popularity in Australia with supermarkets stocking pre-prepared versions of the drink. A variety called Ponche Crema has been made and consumed in Venezuela and Trinidad since the 1900s, also in the Christmas season. During this period commercially prepared <b>eggnog</b> is sold in grocery stores in these countries.|$|E
5000|$|Modern {{commercial}} <b>eggnog</b> manufacturers add gelatin {{and other}} thickeners, a cost-savings measure that enables manufacturers {{to produce a}} thick beverage while using less egg and cream. [...] "Commercial <b>eggnog</b> tends to contain less eggs than homemade nog". In the US, [...] "FDA regulations only require that 1.0 percent of a product’s final weight {{be made up of}} egg yolk solids for it to bear the <b>eggnog</b> name." [...] Under current U.S. law, commercial products sold as <b>eggnog</b> are permitted to contain milk, sugar, modified milk ingredients, glucose-fructose, water, carrageenan, guar gum, natural and artificial flavorings, spices, monoglycerides, and colorings. In Canada, the [...] "National Dairy Code defines <b>eggnog</b> as: [...] "food made from milk and cream containing milk and cream which has been flavoured and sweetened. The food shall contain not less than 3.25 per cent milk fat and not less than 23 per cent total solids." [...] In Canada, if a commercial product does not contain eggs, it cannot be called [...] "eggnog".|$|E
50|$|The {{large number}} of small dairy farms in America in the early 19th century made milk, cream, and <b>eggnog</b> more {{accessible}} to the American public. George Washington drank <b>eggnog</b> that contained not only rum, but also significant amounts of sherry, brandy, and whiskey.|$|E
50|$|For {{concerns}} {{about the safety of}} selling products made from raw eggs and milk, the U.S. FDA has changed or altered the definition of <b>eggnog</b> a number of times towards artificial replacements for the large number of eggs traditionally used. FDA regulations (as of January 2015) require <b>eggnog</b> to contain at least 1% egg yolk solids and at least 8.25% milk solids. Some recipes for homemade <b>eggnog</b> call for egg yolks to be cooked with milk into a custard to avoid potential hazards from raw eggs.|$|E
