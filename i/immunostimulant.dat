We investigated the effects of <b>immunostimulants</b> (LPS, dextran sulfate and tilorone) on biotransformation and macrophage activities in carp. The major effect of LPS was its capacity to inhibit 3 -MC-induced cytochrome P 450 activities in the liver and head kidney. Basal phase I activities were reduced by tilorone and dextran sulfate in immune organs. Tilorone and dextran sulfate differently modulated total cytochrome P 450 contents and P 4501 A activities suggesting differential sensitivity for P 450 classes. In immune organs, tilorone and dextran sulfate inhibited basal EROD activity. Tilorone inhibited 3 -MC-induced EROD activity whereas dextran sulfate enhanced this activity. LPS and dextran sulfate increased ROS production by macrophages and all the <b>immunostimulants</b> induced macrophage activating factor (MAF) production. This study demonstrates for the first time in fish the capacity of CYP-regulated <b>immunostimulants</b> to activate macrophages and provides initial insight into the capacity of macrophages to regulate CYP activity induced by <b>immunostimulants</b> in fish.

These cells produced superoxide anion both spontaneously and in repsonse to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) in a dose-related manner. The response to PMA peaked in approximately 2 hr and maintained plateau levels for an additional 2 - 3 hr before subsiding. Pretreat-ment of the macrophages in vitro with a number of <b>immunostimulants</b> en-hanced the production of superoxide above that of controls.

40|$|The use of <b>immunostimulants</b> in {{fish farming}} has {{received}} increased attention {{due to the}} discovery of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). These receptors have been found to bind to highly conserved motifs on the surface of pathogens, known as pathogen associated molecular patterns. Most of the studied PAMPs activate antigen presenting cells (APCs) together with naïve T-cells, and may induce TH 1 and TH 2 responses with production of signature molecules such as IFN-γ and IL- 4 respectively (Aderem and Ulevitch, 2000). In this study, different <b>immunostimulants</b> acting as ligands for TLRs were administered to Atlantic salmon by intraperitoneal injection. At different time points (1 - 14 days) post injection, samples of spleen, head kidney and liver were obtained from the different treatment groups. Gene transcripts for the TH 1 signature genes IFN-γ and TNF-α, TH 2 transcription factor GATA- 3 and regulatory IL- 10 as well as the surface receptors CD 8 and CD 4, were subjected to analysis by Q-RT-PCR. All the applied <b>immunostimulants</b> induced expression of TNF-α in both the spleen and kidney. Induction of IFN-γ gene transcription was performed by β-glucan, LPS, pDNA and imiquimod. Only β-glucan induced GATA- 3 expression in both the spleen and head kidney. Interleukin- 10 gene expression was induced by all <b>immunostimulants</b> except LPS.

Adjustment of the expression levels according to their respective control group values showed that upregulation of TH 1 expression was induced by β-glucan, imiquimod and pDNA + LPS. Upregulation of GATA- 3 gene transcription was induced by β-glucan and imiquimod, while pDNA, imiquimod and pDNA + LPS up-regulated transcription of IL- 10.

To fight various harmful pathogens, the enhanced shrimp immunity by <b>immunostimulants</b> would play key roles against the invading pathogens. In aquaculture, however, the target proteins/genes {{which can be used}} for the screening of <b>immunostimulants</b> are very limited. Based on our previous study, in the present study, the shrimp Ran protein, which was required in shrimp antiviral phagocytosis, was used as the target protein to screen for <b>immunostimulants.</b> The GTPase activity assays showed that the IL- 4 and lysophosphatidylcholine molecules could enhance the activity of Ran protein, suggesting that the two molecules might function in phagocytosis. When the IL- 4 and lysophosphatidylcholine were respectively injected into shrimp, the results indicated that the two molecules enhanced the hemocytic phagocytosis against white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), suggesting that they improved the activity of phagocytosis through the activation of the Ran protein. It was evidenced that the enhancement of phagocytosis activity effectively inhibited the WSSV infection in shrimp, which further led to the decrease of mortalities of WSSV-infected shrimp. Therefore, our study presented a novel strategy for the screening of <b>immunostimulants</b> by using the key proteins in immune responses of aquatic organisms as the target proteins, which would be very helpful for the development of efficient approaches to prevent the aquatic organisms from pathogen infections.

40|$|Bacterial {{lipopolysaccharide}} (LPS) and {{a diverse}} array of other <b>immunostimulants</b> and cytokines suppress the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous substances by reducing activity of the hepatic cytochrome P 450 mixed-function oxidase system. Although this effect of <b>immunostimulants</b> was first described almost 40 yr ago, the mechanism is obscure. <b>Immunostimulants</b> are now known to cause NO overproduction by cells via induction of nitric oxide synthase. We have investigated whether NO overproduction is involved in suppressing hepatic metabolism by LPS. In vitro treatment of hepatic microsomes with NO, produced by chemical decomposition of 3 -morpholinosydnonimine or by nitric oxide synthase, substantially suppressed cytochrome P 450 -dependent oxygenation reactions. This effect of NO was seen with hepatic microsomes prepared from two species (rat and chicken) and after exposure to chemicals that induce distinct molecular isoforms of cytochromes P 450 (beta-naphthoflavone, 3 -methylcholanthrene, and phenobarbital). Spectral studies indicate that NO reacts in vitro with both Fe(2 +) - and Fe(3 +) -hemes in microsomal cytochromes P 450. In vivo, LPS diminished the phenobarbital-induced dealkylation of 7 -pentoxyresorufin by rat liver microsomes and reduced the apparent P 450 content as measured by CO binding. These LPS effects were associated with induction of NO synthesis; LPS-induced NO synthesis showed a strong positive correlation with the severity of cytochrome P 450 inhibition. The decrease in both hepatic microsomal P 450 activity and CO binding caused by LPS was largely prevented by the selective NO synthase inhibitor N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester.
