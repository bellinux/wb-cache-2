In his formal {{audience}} with the English-speaking and Western-oriented Second King, Phra Pin Klao, Harris stated America's position:The United States does not hold any possessions in the East, nor does it desire any. The form of government forbids the holding of colonies. The United States therefore cannot be an object of jealousy to any Eastern Power.

American missionary Stephen Matoon, who had acted as translator, was appointed the first United States consul to Siam.|$|E
50|$|Early United States {{entry into}} what was then called the East Indies (usually in {{reference}} to the Malay Archipelago) was low key. In 1795, a secret voyage for pepper set sail from Salem, Massachusetts on an 18-month voyage that returned with a bulk cargo of pepper, the first to be so imported into the country, which sold at the extraordinary profit of seven hundred per cent. In 1831, the merchantman Friendship of Salem returned to report the ship had been plundered, and the first officer and two crewmen murdered in Sumatra. The Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 obligated the Dutch {{to ensure the safety of}} shipping and overland trade in and around Aceh, who accordingly sent the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army on the punitive expedition of 1831. President Andrew Jackson also ordered America's first Sumatran punitive expedition of 1832, which was followed by a punitive expedition in 1838. The Friendship incident thus afforded the Dutch a reason to take over Ache; and Jackson, to dispatch diplomatist Edmund Roberts, who in 1833 secured the Roberts Treaty with Siam. In 1856 negotiations for amendment of this treaty, Townsend Harris stated the position of the United States:The United States does not hold any possessions in the East, nor does it desire any. The form of government forbids the holding of colonies. The United States therefore cannot be an object of jealousy to any Eastern Power.

40|$|The public’s {{approval}} of the president plays {{a critical role in}} determining the president’s power and policy-making success. Scholars and pundits have thus devoted a large amount of attention to explaining the dynamics of presidential approval. Surprisingly, this work has over-looked one of the more important potential forces behind approval—that <b>is,</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> himself says. In this article, we examine the direct impact of presidential rhetoric on approval. We do so by combining a content analysis of the 2002 State of the Union address with both a laboratory experiment and a nationally representative survey. We show that the president can have a substantial effect on his own approval by priming the criteria on which citizens base their approval evaluations. Our results add a new dimension to the study of presidential approval, raise intriguing questions about accountability, and extend work on priming and public opinion by introducing the idea of image priming. Does presidential rhetoric affect presidential approval? Surprisingly, virtually no research has addressed this question—despite widespread recognition that presidents invest substantial resources to perfect their rhetoric (Edwards 2002), and clear evidence that approval fundamentally affects the president’s power and policy-making succes...|$|E

The relevant arguments are illustrated throughout with reference to the 2001 authorization for the use of military force in response to the attacks of September 11; the authorization may or may not include the power to make war on Iraq and Afghanistan, to use force against those suspected of giving financial aid to terrorist organizations, and to detain American citizens...|$|R

The article examines the two prevailing approaches taken in the academic literature to this longstanding issue of the constitutional allocation of powers, described here as mandatory enforcement and routine non-enforcement of constitutionally objectionable statutes.

Legal analyst Jeffrey Rosen has argued that Section 4 gives <b>the</b> <b>President</b> unilateral authority to raise or ignore the national debt ceiling, and that if challenged the Supreme Court would likely rule in favor of expanded executive power or dismiss the case altogether for lack of standing.

[...] American missionaries had brought modern medicine and set up educational institutions all over the Middle East. Moreover, the United States had provided the Middle East with highly skilled petroleum engineers. Thus, there were some connections made between the United States and the Middle East before the Second World War. Other examples of cooperations between the U.S. and the Middle East are the Red Line Agreement signed in 1928 and the Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement signed in 1944. Both of these agreements were legally binding and reflected an American interest in control of Middle Eastern energy resources, namely oil, and moreover reflected an American [...] "security imperative to prevent the (re)emergence of a powerful regional rival". The Red Line Agreement had been [...] "part of a network of agreements made in the 1920s to restrict supply of petroleum and ensure that the major American companies … could control oil prices on world markets". The Red Line agreement governed the development of Middle East oil for the next two decades.
