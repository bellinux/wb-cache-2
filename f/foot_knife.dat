50|$|After {{an evening}} spent {{wandering}} round the local coffee bars, the gang {{go looking for}} trouble and decide to beat up a black youth for kicks. They are inflamed to see a black boy accompanied by a white girl, and they chase them through the dark streets before cornering them and launching a vicious assault on the couple using fists, <b>feet,</b> <b>knives</b> and bicycle chains. The boy is so brutally beaten that he later dies from his injuries in hospital, and the girl is stabbed during the melee. Frank is horrified when he realises that the injured girl is his sister.|$|R
5000|$|In the variant {{known as}} [...] "Stretch", {{the object of}} the game is to make the other player fall over from having to spread his legs too far apart. The players begin facing each other some {{distance}} apart with their own heels and toes touching, and take turns attempting to stick their knives in the ground outboard of the other player's <b>feet.</b> If the <b>knife</b> sticks, the other player must move his foot out to where the knife stuck while keeping the other foot in place, provided the distance between <b>foot</b> and <b>knife</b> is about twelve inches or less. Play continues until one player falls or is unable to make the required stretch.|$|R
60|$|When I woke, it {{was past}} noon, {{and the sun was}} shining {{directly}} on me. Standing up to gaze once more on the prospect, I noticed a small wreath of white smoke issuing from a spot about the middle of the forest belt beneath me, and I instantly divined that Nuflo had made a fire at that place, and I resolved to surprise him in his retreat. When I got down {{to the base of the}} hill the smoke could no longer be seen, but I had studied the spot well from above, and had singled out a large clump of trees on the edge of the belt as a starting-point; and after a search of half an hour I succeeded in finding the old man's hiding-place. First I saw smoke again through an opening in the trees, then a small rude hut of sticks and palm leaves. Approaching cautiously, I peered through a crack and discovered old Nuflo engaged in smoking some meat over a fire, and at the same time grilling some bones on the coals. He had captured a coatimundi, an animal somewhat larger than a tame tom-cat, with a long snout and long ringed tail; one of the dogs was gnawing at the animal's head, and the tail and the feet were also lying on the floor, among the old bones and rubbish that littered it. Stealing round, I suddenly presented myself at the opening to his den, when the dogs rose up with a growl and Nuflo instantly leaped to his <b>feet,</b> <b>knife</b> in hand.|$|R
50|$|Alonzo the Armless is {{a circus}} freak who uses his <b>feet</b> to toss <b>knives</b> and fire a rifle at his partner, Nanon. However, {{he is an}} impostor and fugitive. He has arms, but keeps them tightly bound to his torso, a secret known only to his friend Cojo, a midget. Alonzo's left hand has a double thumb, which would {{identify}} him as the perpetrator of various crimes.|$|R
50|$|Traditional South Korean {{criminal}} groups fights rarely {{resulted in}} deaths as they fought with their hands, <b>feet</b> and heads. <b>Knives</b> and metal bars only {{began to show}} up as weapons in the 1970s. In today’s South Korean society, a person {{is not to be}} in possession of guns, swords or knives which may explain why traditional crime groups did not use weapons (Lee, 2006).|$|R
6000|$|One of them, {{the smaller}} of the two, and if {{anything}} the more vicious-looking, {{put his hands on}} the rail of the Mist and started to come aboard. Quick as a flash Paul placed the end of the oar against the man's chest and shoved him back into his boat. He fell in a heap, but scrambled to his <b>feet,</b> waving the <b>knife</b> and shrieking: ...|$|R
60|$|A {{letter from}} Dr. Campbell reached me {{three days after}} my arrival, begging me to cross {{the country to the}} Teesta river, and meet him at Bhomsong, on its west bank, where he was {{awaiting}} my arrival. I therefore left on the 20th of December, accompanied by my friend the Kajee, who was going to pay his respects to the Rajah. He was constantly followed by a lad, carrying a bamboo of Murwa beer slung round his neck, with which he kept himself always groggy. His dress was thoroughly Lepcha, and highly picturesque, consisting of a very broad-brimmed round-crowned bamboo-platted hat, scarlet jacket, and blue-striped cloth shirt, bare <b>feet,</b> long <b>knife,</b> bow and quiver, rings and earrings, and a long pigtail. He spoke no Hindoostanee, but was very communicative through my interpreters.|$|R
60|$|Blackie {{leaped to}} his feet, with an oath--a frightful, hideous oath--and as he rose he swung a heavy fist to Soup Face's purple nose. The latter rolled over backward; but was upon his feet again much quicker than {{one would have}} {{expected}} in so gross a bulk, and as he came to his <b>feet</b> a <b>knife</b> flashed in his hand. With a sound that was more bestial than human he ran toward Blackie; {{but there was another}} there who had anticipated his intentions. As the blow was struck The Sky Pilot had risen; and now he sprang forward, for all his age and bulk as nimble as a cat, and seized Soup Face by the wrist. A quick wrench brought a howl of pain to the would-be assassin, and the knife fell to the floor.|$|R
50|$|One day, {{the warden}} places a virgin {{prisoner}} in stocks, and forces Jennifer {{to watch as}} she violently fists the woman, causing her to bleed. Suzanne is raped in her cell by a guard named Arnie, and the mentally ill inmate is tied up and tortured by Bertucci and the warden, who mutilate her <b>feet</b> with a <b>knife,</b> and hot wax. Suzanne is shackled, and is raped and whipped by Stevie and Arnie as Bertucci films it. Arnie then takes the nude Suzanne out to the jungle, and after molesting her, leaves her to die.|$|R
5000|$|Having {{passed through}} the first stages of solitary {{confinement}} and a probationary period Maybrick then entered a third stage of hard labour whereby she was permitted to leave her cell during the day to assist in carrying meals from the kitchen. [...] Her day commenced at 6am and ended at 5.30pm during which she had, according to her memoirs, to wash ten four quart cans, scrub one twenty foot table, two twelve <b>foot</b> dressers, clean <b>knives,</b> wash a sack of potatoes, assist in serving the dinners and scrub a piece of floor twenty by ten feet.|$|R
50|$|Clara is beaten, raped, {{and abused}} {{in various ways}} {{throughout}} the movie, {{as she tries to}} find a way to escape. Finally Clara comes to realize that in order to survive she must manipulate him through what he writes in the Scrapbook. Slowly Leonard starts to give her food and clothes. Clara pretends that she wants to make love to Leonard and uses duct tape to tie his arms and legs to the cot. Thereafter, she stabs Leonard on the bottom of his <b>feet</b> with a <b>knife</b> and takes pictures of him in pain. She puts those pictures in the Scrapbook and the film ends with her walking away from the house.|$|R
5000|$|Later {{the same}} night, in the Venice Beach area of Los Angeles, Manson asked Kasabian to {{participate}} in the murder of an acquaintance, a Lebanese actor named Saladin Nader. Kasabian had met the actor a few days earlier with fellow [...] "family" [...] member Sandra Good. Atkins and Grogan waited a few <b>feet</b> away, with <b>knife</b> and gun in hand, prepared to kill, as Manson had told them to. Kasabian purposely knocked on the wrong apartment door in order to avoid causing any harm to Nader. When the occupant answered, Kasabian apologized and excused herself, thus preventing the crime. Two days after the LaBianca murders, she fled from the Manson [...] "family", and she eventually returned to her mother's home in New Hampshire.|$|R
60|$|They were leisurely {{enough for}} him to take in the full meaning of the portent, and to taste the flavour of death rising in his gorge. His wife had gone raving mad—murdering mad. They were leisurely enough for the first paralysing effect of this {{discovery}} to pass away before a resolute determination to come out victorious from the ghastly struggle with that armed lunatic. They were leisurely enough for Mr Verloc to elaborate a plan of defence involving a dash behind the table, and the felling of the woman to the ground with a heavy wooden chair. But they were not leisurely enough to allow Mr Verloc the time to move either hand or <b>foot.</b> The <b>knife</b> was already planted in his breast. It met no resistance on its way. Hazard has such accuracies. Into that plunging blow, delivered {{over the side of the}} couch, Mrs Verloc had put all the inheritance of her immemorial and obscure descent, the simple ferocity of the age of caverns, and the unbalanced nervous fury of the age of bar-rooms. Mr Verloc, the Secret Agent, turning slightly on his side with the force of the blow, expired without stirring a limb, in the muttered sound of the word “Don’t” by way of protest.|$|R
6000|$|... '"That is how I was honoured by the King," [...] I said. [...] "They'll hang ye {{for killing}} me, Benedetto. And, since you've {{killed in the}} King's Palace, they'll draw and quarter you; but you're too mad to care. Grant me, though, ye never heard a better tale." [...] 'He said nothing, but I felt him shake. My head on his chest shook; his right arm fell away, his left dropped the knife, and he leaned with both hands on my shoulder--shaking--shaking! I turned me round. No need to put my <b>foot</b> on his <b>knife.</b> The man was {{speechless}} with laughter--honest craftsman's mirth. The first time I'd ever seen him laugh. You know the mirth that cuts off the very breath, while ye stamp and snatch at the short ribs? That was Benedetto's case.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{the body}} {{scent of the}} deer told Tarzan that his prey was close at hand. It sent him into the trees again--into the lower terrace where he could watch the ground below and catch with ears and nose the first intimation of actual contact with his quarry. Nor was it long before the ape-man came upon Bara {{standing}} alert {{at the edge of}} a moon-bathed clearing. Noiselessly Tarzan crept through the trees until he was directly over the deer. In the ape-man's right hand was the long hunting knife of his father and in his heart the blood lust of the carnivore. Just for an instant he poised above the unsuspecting Bara and then he launched himself downward upon the sleek back. The impact of his weight carried the deer to its knees and before the animal could regain its <b>feet</b> the <b>knife</b> had found its heart. As Tarzan rose upon the body of his kill to scream forth his hideous victory cry into the face of the moon the wind carried to his nostrils something which froze him to statuesque immobility and silence. His savage eyes blazed into the direction from which the wind had borne down the warning to him and a moment later the grasses at one side of the clearing parted and Numa, the lion, strode majestically into view. His yellow-green eyes were fastened upon Tarzan as he halted just within the clearing and glared enviously at the successful hunter, for Numa had had no luck this night.|$|R
5000|$|Bowie, {{rising to}} his <b>feet,</b> drew his <b>knife</b> and charged at Crain, who struck him so hard upon {{the head with}} his empty pistol that it broke and sent Bowie to his knees. Wright appeared, drew a pistol, and shot at the fallen Bowie, missing. Wright then drew his sword cane and stabbed Bowie in the chest, but the thin blade was {{deflected}} by his sternum. As Wright attempted to pull the blade free, Bowie reached up, grabbed his shirt, and pulled him down upon the point of his Bowie knife. Wright died quickly and Bowie was shot again and stabbed by {{another member of the}} group. As Bowie stood, both Blanchard brothers fired at him, and he was struck once in the arm. Bowie spun and cut off part of Alfred's forearm; Carey fired a second shot at Bowie, but missed. As the Blanchard brothers fled, Alfred was shot [...] "through the arm" [...] by Jefferson Wells while Carey was shot at by Major McWorter [...] "without effect".|$|R
5000|$|José Raúl Anguiano Valadez (February 26, 1915 [...] - [...] January 13, 2006) was {{a notable}} Mexican painter of the 20th century, {{part of the}} “second generation” of Mexican muralists which {{continued}} the tradition of Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros but experimented with it as well. Anguiano was born {{during the height of}} the Mexican Revolution, which would inspire a majority of his mural painting. He studied painting in his hometown of Guadalajara before moving to Mexico City to begin his career. His first major exhibition was held at the Palacio de Bellas Artes, at age 20. His works include over 100 individual and collective exhibitions with 50 murals, mostly in Mexico and the United States. As he continued his artistry with aspects of the Mexican muralism movement, he also experimented with other styles such as Cubism, Surrealism and Expressionism, with themes such as clowns and prostitutes. However, his most famous painting is “La espina” (The thorn) which depicts a Mayan woman digging a thorn out of her <b>foot</b> with a <b>knife.</b> His later works concentrated on depicting Mexico in vivid colors and traditional imagery.|$|R
5000|$|Most of Anguiano’s work {{focuses on}} {{indigenous}} and rural Mexico, its festivals, history traditions and religion, which {{for him was}} Mexico. Anguiano’s mural work is mostly inspired by the Mexican Revolution and the efforts of those related to Álvaro Obregón afterwards. Oils and other works had themes from pre Hispanic ruins, especially Mayan stele, landscapes and the life and customs of the Lacandon Jungle. Work such as “La Espina,” “Lacandonas asando monos zarahuatos” and “Nákin de perfil,” depicted indigenous as contemporary people, rather than historical. He also depicted the problems facing them such as {{the destruction of the}} environment. His work is credited with helping to educate many about rural life in Mexico as well as discrimination against the indigenous. He said that in his work he [...] "sought to glimpse the soul of the Mexican people". He masterpiece is considered to be “La Espina,” which was used for many years to illustrate public school textbooks. It depicts a Lacandon Maya woman seated and digging a spine out of her <b>foot</b> with a <b>knife.</b> The work sold for $156,000 USD at Christie's Latin American auction in New York on 25 May 2004.|$|R
6000|$|Another human {{phenomenon}} which annoyed {{and shocked}} my tender mind, {{like that of}} the contests on the beach between young gentlemen and washerwomen, was the multitude of beggars which infested the town. These were not like our dignified beggar on horseback, with his red poncho, spurs and tall straw hat, who rode to your gate, and having received his tribute, blessed you and rode away to the next estancia. These city beggars on the pavement were the most brutal, even fiendish, looking men I had ever seen. Most of them were old soldiers, who, having served their ten, fifteen, or twenty years, according {{to the nature of the}} crime for which they had been condemned to the army, had been discharged or thrown out to live like carrion-hawks on what they could pick up. Twenty times a day at least you would hear the iron gate opening from the courtyard into the street swung open, followed by the call or shout of the beggar demanding charity in the name of God. Outside you could not walk far without being confronted by one of these men, who would boldly square himself in front of you on the narrow pavement and beg for alms. If you had no change and said, [...] "Perdon, por Dios," [...] he would scowl and let you pass; but if you looked annoyed or disgusted, or ordered him out of the way, or pushed by without a word, he would glare at you with a concentrated rage which seemed to say, [...] "Oh, to have you down at my mercy, bound hand and <b>foot,</b> a sharp <b>knife</b> in my hand!" [...] And this would be followed by a blast of the most horrible language.|$|R
