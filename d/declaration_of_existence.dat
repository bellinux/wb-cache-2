Save for the intense white recoil of the moon, the earth would stagger towards the sun. The moon holds us to our own cosmic individuality, as a world individual in space. She is the fierce center of retraction, of frictional withdrawal into separateness. She it is who sullenly stands with her back to us, and refuses to meet and mingle. She it is who burns white with the intense friction of her withdrawal into separation, that cold, proud white fire of furious, almost malignant apartness, the struggle into fierce, frictional separation. Her white fire is the frictional fire of the last strange, intense watery matter, as this matter fights its way out of combination and out of combustion with the sun-stuff. To the pure polarity of the moon fly the essential waters of our universe. Which essential waters, at the moon's clue, are only an intense invisible energy, a polarity of the moon.|$|R

60|$|But my scepticisms {{about the}} current legal {{institutions}} and customary code are not exhausted by these modifications I have suggested. I believe firmly {{in some sort of}} marriage, that is to say an open <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> sexual relations {{between a man and a}} woman, because I am averse to all unnecessary secrecies and because the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> these peculiarly intimate relationships affects everybody about the persons concerned. It is ridiculous to say as some do that sexual relations between two people affect no one but themselves unless a child is born. They do, because they tend to break down barriers and set up a peculiar emotional partnership. It is a partnership that kept secret may work as anti-socially as a secret business partnership or a secret preferential railway tariff. And I believe too in the general social desirability of the family group, the normal group of father, mother and children, and in the extreme efficacy in the normal human being of the blood link and pride link between parent and child in securing loving care and upbringing for the child. But this clear adhesion to Marriage and to the Family grouping about mother and father does not close the door to a large series of exceptional cases which our existing institutions and customs ignore or crush.|$|R

40|$|Universities {{across the}} world are {{responding}} {{to the need for}} a move towards more sustainable forms of human activity. To determine current progress towards sustainability in Australia, we conducted a comprehensive survey of all 38 Australian universities. A selection of overseas universities was also surveyed to provide an international benchmark. A web-based survey and written questionnaire were conducted, providing information on seven key areas of environmental practice: curriculum, scholarly activities, institutional operations, staff development and rewards, outreach and services, student opportunities and institutional mission and structure (based on the seven dimensions of the ULSF Sustainability Assessment Questionnaire). The survey revealed a high level of commitment and extent of actions being taken by universities throughout the world {{to address the issue of}} sustainability. Examples include the exponential growth in signatories to <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> sustainability, the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> national and international networks and impressive innovation in environmentally sustainable design and practice. Despite these achievements, sustainability cannot yet be considered a mainstream activity in the majority of universities in Australia. There is very little evidence as yet from Australian universities and worldwide of triple bottom line reporting, despite leadership from business corporations. Additionally, several key practices were not found in the majority of Australian universities; most noticeably ethical investment, purchasing protocols and faculty and staff development and rewards...|$|R
40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1995 Pamela Anne O'Connor. The Social Security Act 1991 incorporates the general legal meaning of property in its definition of an asset, {{for the purpose of}} the pension means test. This creates the opportunity for pension applicants to argue that assessable assets held by them should be reduced by the amount of any equitable proprietry rights held by others in the assets. The Federal Court has held in Kintominas v Secretary, DSS and in Kidner v Secretary, DSS that equitable proprietry claims under remedial doctrines, such as under the constructive trust doctrine discussed in Baumgartner v Baumgartner are to be regarded as property even though there has been no judicial <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> their <b>existence,</b> no dispute between the legal owner and the person claiming an equitabe interest, an no unconscionable abuse of title rights by the legal owner. This thesis argues that the Federal Court’s approach is not the preferable one, for three main reasons. The first relates to the changing nature of the constructive trust to a necessary element. The second is that, {{at a time when the}} constructive trust in Australia is in transition from the traditional institutional conception to a remedial paradigm along North American lines, the beneficial interest should no longer be viewed as existing independently of a judicial decree. The third argument is that, even if an equitable interest under a remedial constructive trust is accepted as existing independently <b>of</b> a curial <b>declaration,</b> it cannot be valued for the purposes of the assets test.
