5|$|According to Johnson {{this was}} his {{favorite}} play of all-time. Games 6 and 7 also featured a feud, this time between Pistons forward Dennis Rodman and <b>Johnson.</b> <b>In</b> Game 6, which the Pistons won, Rodman taunted <b>Johnson</b> <b>in</b> the closing seconds by waving his right hand over his head. When the Celtics took Game 7, Johnson went back at Rodman in the last moments {{of the game and}} mimicked his taunting gesture. In the 1987 NBA Finals, however, the Celtics succumbed to the Los Angeles Lakers 4–2 as Lakers playmaker and Finals MVP Magic Johnson put up a great performance, averaging 26 points and 13 assists throughout the series.|$|E
