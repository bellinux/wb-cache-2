Some forests locally known as bouças are <b>defined</b> <b>areas</b> with maritime pines, oaks and eucalyptus plantations. Forests are still important in parishes {{surrounded by the}} Serra de Rates, whose flora is distinguished by the pedunculate oak or the european holly. In the 18th century, the monks of Tibães planted pines, which characterized the civil parish of Estela. In the past the Atlantic forest predominated, with trees such as oaks, ash trees, hazels, strawberry trees, holm oak, and alders.|$|E
5|$|The known {{range of}} Boletopsis nothofagi {{is limited to}} two {{narrowly}} <b>defined</b> <b>areas</b> of New Zealand, one on the North Island {{and the other on}} the South Island. These areas are in Rimutaka Forest Park near Wellington, and Saint Arnaud {{in the northern part of}} the South Island. These locations are relatively far away from each other and isolated, which, together with its absence in the rest of New Zealand, makes it unlikely that the species is a recent import. It is more likely that the species is native to New Zealand and has been overlooked in earlier surveys due to its rarity.|$|E

Biomes are defined on the basis of factors such as plant structures (such as trees, shrubs, and grasses), leaf types (such as broadleaf and needleleaf), plant spacing (forest, woodland, savanna), and climate. Unlike ecozones, biomes are not defined by genetic, taxonomic, or historical similarities. Biomes are often identified with particular patterns of ecological succession and climax vegetation.|$|E

25|$|In 1689, the absolutist Catholic monarch of France Louis XIV {{unilaterally}} revoked the Edict of Nantes. This royal edict had {{protected the}} minority Protestant population from religious persecution within certain <b>defined</b> <b>areas</b> of France. Despite {{the fact that}} the Protestants were France's most industrious class, Louis XIV was determined to drive them out of France. Faced with the prospect of the resurgence of another war of religion, Protestant countries of Europe opened up their territories to these French Protestants, or Huguenots. John Pell, Lord of Pelham Manor, under warrant from the King William III of England, provided land to Huguenot families, most of whom were from the Province of Aunis and the city of La Rochelle.|$|E
25|$|The city {{occupies}} a small valley and is almost completely surrounded by large hills, {{which are also}} covered in housing. The city centre has maintained most of its colonial-era structures, with narrow winding streets. Away from this centre is the more modern Pachuca, with warehouses, factories, supermarkets and a large football stadium called “El Huracán” (The Hurricane). The local team has won eight national and international titles here since it was built. The city proper has a population (2005) of 267,751 which is 97% {{of the population of}} the municipality.

25|$|The {{art history}} of the Hellenic era is {{generally}} subdivided into four periods: the Protogeometric (1100–900 BC), the Geometric (900–700 BC), the Archaic (700 – 500 BC) and the Classical (500 – 323 BC) with sculpture being further divided into Severe Classical, High Classical and Late Classical. The first signs of the particular artistic character that defines ancient Greek architecture are {{to be seen in}} the pottery of the Dorian Greeks from the 10th century BC. Already at this period it is created with a sense of proportion, symmetry and balance not apparent in similar pottery from Crete and Mycenae. The decoration is precisely geometric, and ordered neatly into zones on <b>defined</b> <b>areas</b> of each vessel. These qualities were to manifest themselves not only through a millennium of Greek pottery making, but also in the architecture that was to emerge in the 6th century. The major development that occurred was in the growing use of the human figure as the major decorative motif, and the increasing surety with which humanity, its mythology, activities and passions were depicted.|$|E
500|$|On {{an appeal}} by the Public Prosecutor to the High Court, Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin {{accepted}} the appellant's submission that the Rules {{were intended to}} reduce traffic congestion within <b>defined</b> <b>areas</b> of the city, and thus were {{within the scope of}} section 90(1) since the long title of the Act indicated it was a statute [...] "to make provisions for the regulation of traffic on roads", among other things. The primary purpose of the Rules was not the collection of fees but the regulation of traffic flow. The Chief Justice also disagreed with the respondent's submission that the Rules were ultra vires since section 90(1) only empowered the Minister to regulate road traffic and not to prohibit it entirely. In the judge's opinion, the Rules did not wholly prohibit vehicles from using roads within the restricted zone, but merely regulated traffic entering and remaining within the zone.|$|E

The historical presence of the San in Botswana is particularly evident in northern Botswana's Tsodilo Hills region.

The San were traditionally semi-nomadic, moving seasonally within certain <b>defined</b> <b>areas</b> based on the availability of resources such as water, game animals, and edible plants. As of 2010, the San population in Botswana numbers about 50,000 to 60,000.|$|E
