50|$|Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii, {{also known}} as coast Douglas-fir, Oregon pine, or <b>Douglas</b> <b>spruce,</b> is an {{evergreen}} conifer native to western North America from west-central British Columbia, Canada southward to central California, United States. In Oregon and Washington its range is continuous from the Cascades crest west to the Pacific Coast Ranges and Pacific Ocean. In California, it {{is found in the}} Klamath and California Coast Ranges as far south as the Santa Lucia Mountains with a small stand as far south as the Purisima Hills, Santa Barbara County. In the Sierra Nevada it ranges as far south as the Yosemite region. It occurs from near sea level along the coast to 1800 m in the California Mountains. Further inland, coast Douglas-fir is replaced by Rocky Mountain or interior Douglas-fir (P. menziesii var. glauca). Interior Douglas-fir intergrades with coast Douglas-fir in the Cascades of northern Washington and southern British Columbia.|$|E
50|$|The Pomo {{people are}} {{scattered}} into six different geographical areas. There are the Northeastern Pomos, Northern Pomos, Central Pomos, Southern Pomos, Southeastern Pomos, and Eastern Pomos. They mostly surround the area outside of Lake Sonoma {{which was one}} of the main resources of the central Pomo people. Timber is also found surrounding the area where the Pomo people reside. Mountains next to the shore are covered for most of the way from Mount Tamalpais, on the northern shore of San Francisco Bay, towards the north with a dense forest of redwood, Sequoia sempervirens. Pseudotsuga taxifolia is significantly abundant in the mountain of the region the <b>Douglas</b> <b>spruce</b> and the redwood belt. The area of land occupied by the Pomo people is divided: the main area extends from west to east in northern California, from the Californian coast to the main range of the Coast Range mountains. The space from north to south is between the vicinity of Santa Rosa to Sherwood valley. The second area is the smaller of the two, only being from the headwaters of stony creek in Colusa and Glenn counties. Both of theses areas are populated by Pomo people, but the latter area is populated by tribes that speak a different dialect of the language. Thus Pomo people occupy all of Russian River Valley except for two areas, the first being between Geyserville and Healdsburg, and the second at the extreme head of Potter valley. To the west of the Pomo population is the Pacific Ocean; to the east the Yukian-Wappo and Wintun people are located; to the north are the Yuki and Athatpascan Kato people; and to the south the Moquelumnan people. The Yuki and Athatpascan Kato people who are located at the northern point are separated from the Pomo people by the watershed between Cahto and Sherwood valleys. Throughout northern California, true Pomo tribes no longer exist. The largest geographical and political divisions are villages and bodies of power surrounding them.|$|E
50|$|The Öschbrig {{is covered}} with a larch forest, {{partially}} destroyed by the Lothar storm in December 1999. <b>Douglas</b> <b>spruces,</b> uncommon in this region, are also present, while the clearings created by Lothar have been colonized by beeches and ashes. In the forest live among others voracious deer.|$|R

60|$|It {{was quite}} a {{scramble}} down to the stream bed, and, once on the bed, we went down stream perhaps for a hundred feet. And then {{we came to the}} great hole. There was no warning of the existence of the hole, nor was it a hole in the common sense of the word. One crawled through tight-locked briers and branches, and found oneself on the very edge, peering out and down through a green screen. A couple of hundred feet in length and width, it was half of that in depth. Possibly because of some fault that had occurred when the knolls were flung together, and certainly helped by freakish erosion, the hole had been scooped out in the course of centuries by the wash of water. Nowhere did the raw earth appear. All was garmented by vegetation, from tiny maiden-hair and gold-back ferns to mighty redwood and <b>Douglas</b> <b>spruces.</b> These great trees even sprang out from the walls of the hole. Some leaned over at angles as great as forty-five degrees, though the majority towered straight up from the soft and almost perpendicular earth walls.|$|R

50|$|The {{vegetation}} in {{the early}} part of the 20th century consisted of European beech (Fagus sylvatica), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), European larch (Larix decidua), Norway spruce (Picea abies), and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). Following the purchase of the forest land by the Forestry Commission, it was subjected to restrictions and restructuring of the forest vegetation, and reduction of the area. Sequential planting occurred, including <b>Douglas</b> fir, Norway <b>spruce,</b> western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), European beech, Scots pine, European larch and silver birch (Betula pendula Roth).|$|R
40|$|The {{formaldehyde}} {{emission of}} the individual wood species differ from each other. When testing in the 1 m 3 chamber, humid oak wood with 9 ppb showed the highest, beech wood with 2 ppb the lowest value. The values for <b>Douglas</b> fir, <b>spruce</b> and pine ranged between 3 ppb and 4 ppb. With the exception of oak, for dry wood formaldehyde emissions were determined being by 1 to 2 units higher. After a defined drying in an almost formaldehyde-free atmosphere (chamber blank value 1 [...] . 2 ppb) wood moisture values of 7 % to 9 % were attained. The differences regarding the emission values of 3 ppb to 5 ppb are little.

50|$|The globe started {{life as the}} Palais de l'Equilibre at Expo.02 in Neuchâtel, Switzerland. It was {{designed}} by Geneva architects, Hervé Dessimoz and Thomas Büchi, {{as a model of}} sustainable building. It is 27 m high and 40 m in diameter, roughly the size of the dome of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. The globe consists of two concentric spheres nested within one another, made up of five different types of timber: Scotch pine, <b>Douglas</b> pine, <b>spruce,</b> larch, and Canadian maple. The outer shell is composed of wooden slats, and two ramps run between the two spheres, allowing visitors to see out. The inner sphere is made of 18 wooden arches, covered by wooden panels; this forms the walls of the globe's interior. This construction model enables the globe to act as a natural carbon sink.|$|R
