40|$|A sharp {{increase}} of Poisson's ratio {{in the upper}} mantle has beenattributed to the large increase of actual temperature. Possible temperature distribution was calculated on assuming that the upper mantle is mainly composed of eclogite. In the subcontinental upper mantle, actual temperature {{is believed to be}} close to the melting point of eclogite between a depth of 120 and 250 km which coincides with the depth of the low velocity zone. The author proposed that the low velocity zone is starred with oblate spheroidal molten pockets. The <b>elastic</b> <b>ratio</b> at normal temperature and pressure, 0 oo, has been calculated for the upper mantle, in which the <b>elastic</b> <b>ratio</b> increases from 40 (km/s) 2 to 50 (km/s) 2 implying a gradual variation of constituent mineral assemblage with depth. From the considerations of mean atomic weight, density, velocity as well as <b>elastic</b> <b>ratio,</b> the author suggests that the upper mantle is mainly composed of olivine, pyroxene, garnet(pyrope) or even jadeite. Hence, eclogite or garnet peridotite will be the most favourable material in the upper mantle, the basaltic magma being the product of partial melting of these materials originating from the low velocity zone.

40|$|BACKGROUND: With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of real-time elastography (RTE), {{a variety of}} measuring methods {{have been developed for}} the assessment of hepatic fibrosis. We evaluated the overall performance of four methods based on RTE by performing meta-analysis of published literature. METHODS: Online journal databases and a manual search from April 2000 to April 2014 were used. Studies from different databases that meet inclusion criteria were enrolled. The statistical analysis was performed using a random-effects model and fixed-effects model for the overall effectiveness of RTE. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was calculated for various means. Fagan plot analysis was used to estimate the clinical utility of RTE, and the heterogeneity of the studies was explored with meta-regression analysis. RESULTS: Thirteen studies from published articles were enrolled and analyzed. The combined AUROC of the liver fibrosis index (LFI) for the evaluation of significant fibrosis (F≥ 2), advanced fibrosis (F≥ 3), and cirrhosis (F =  4) were 0. 79, 0. 94, and 0. 85, respectively. The AUROC of the elasticity index (EI) ranged from 0. 75 to 0. 92 for F≥ 2 and 0. 66 to 0. 85 for F =  4. The overall AUROC of the <b>elastic</b> <b>ratio</b> of the liver for the intrahepatic venous vessels were 0. 94, 0. 93, and 0. 96, respectively. The AUROC of the <b>elastic</b> <b>ratio</b> of the liver for the intercostal muscle in diagnosing advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis were 0. 96 and 0. 92, respectively. There was significant heterogeneity in the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) for F≥ 2 of LFI mainly due to etiology (p< 0. 01). CONCLUSION: The <b>elastic</b> <b>ratio</b> of the liver for the intrahepatic vein has excellent precision in differentiating each stage of hepatic fibrosis and is recommend to be applied to the clinic...|$|E
