Coarse tips display less regular behavior.

40|$|AbstractDespite the {{tremendous}} sensitivity and lower sample requirements for nanospray vs. conventional electrospray, metallized nanospray emitters {{have suffered from}} one of two problems: low mechanical stability (leading to emitter failure) or lengthy, tedious production methods. Here, we describe a simple alternative to metallized tips using polyaniline (PANI), a synthetic polymer well known for its high conductivity, anticorrosion properties, antistatic properties, and mechanical stability. A simple method for coating borosilicate emitters (1. 2 mm o. d.) pulled to <b>fine</b> <b>tapers</b> (4 ± 1 μm) with water-soluble and xylene-soluble dispersions of conductive polyaniline (which allows for electrical contact at the emitter outlet) is described. The polyaniline-coated emitters show high durability and are resistant to electrical discharge, likely because of the thick (yet optically transparent) coatings; a single emitter can be used {{over a period of}} days for multiple samples with no visible indication of the destruction of the polyaniline coating. The optical transparency of the coating also allows the user to visualize the sample plug loaded into the emitter. Examples of nanospray using coatings of the water-soluble and xylene-soluble polyaniline dispersions are given. A comparison of PANI-coated and gold-coated nanospray emitters to conventional electrospray ionization (ESI) show that PANI-coated emitters provide similar enhanced sensitivity that gold-coated emitters exhibit vs. conventional ESI...|$|R

40|$|NASA, military, and {{commercial}} satellite users need launch {{services that are}} highly reliable, less complex, easier to test, and cost effective. This project has developed a tapered optical fiber sensor for detecting hydrogen. The invention involves incorporating chemical indicators on the tapered end of an optical fiber using organically modified silicate nanomaterials. The Hazardous Gas Detection Lab (HGDL) at Kennedy Space Center {{is involved in the}} design and development of instrumentation that can detect and qualify various mission-critical chemicals. Historically, hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, and argon are the first five gases of HGDL focus. The use of these cryogenic fluids in the area of propulsion offers challenges. Due to their extreme low temperatures, these fluids induce contraction of the materials they contact, a potential cause of leakage. Among them, hydrogen is of particular concern. Small sensors are needed in multiple locations without adding to the structural weight. The most vulnerable parts of the engine are the connection flanges on the transfer lines, which have to support cycles of large thermal amplitude. The thermal protection of the engine provides a closed area, increasing the likelihood of an explosive atmosphere. Thus, even a small leak represents an unacceptable hazardous condition during loading operations, in flight, or after an aborted launch. Tapered fibers were first fabricated from 1 / 1. 3 -mm core/cladding (silica/ plastic) optical fibers. Typically a 1 -ft (approx. 30 - cm) section of the 1 -mm fiber is cut from the bundle and marked with a pen into five 2 -. -in. (. 5. 7 -cm) sections. A propane torch is applied at every alternate mark to burn the jacket and soften the glass core. While the core is softening, the two ends of the fiber are pulled apart slowly to create <b>fine</b> <b>tapers</b> of. - to. -in. (. 6 - to 12 -mm) long on the 1 -mm optical fiber. Following this, the non-tapered ends of the fibers are polished to a 0. 3 -micron finish. Then these fibers were coated with indicators sensitive to hydrogen. The tapered hydrogen detection system with its unique flexibility is the only system that can be placed in many locations inside the vehicles and detect the exact location of leaks, saving millions of dollars for launch vehicle industries...|$|R
40|$|A spectacularly {{preserved}} {{assemblage of}} microbial euendoliths, penetrating into skeletons of growing scleractinian corals, {{has been recognized}} in Early Aptian (Early Cretaceous) reef limestone of the Rara ̆ u Mountains (East Carpathians, NE Romania). Microboring euendolithic filaments were found in five coral colonies of the suborder Microsolenina. They remained in part well-preserved, often impregnated with iron oxides, which made them visible even in strongly recrystallized parts of coral skeletons. Filaments {{of a wide range}} of sizes (2 – 40 l m in diameter) were concentrated within medium parts of coral septa, oriented along the septa in the direction of the coral growth. The larger filaments were tubular, occurring in bundles and branched into <b>finer,</b> often <b>tapering</b> branches. Their behaviour and organization were quite similar to the modern euendolithic siphonalean chlorophyte Ostreobium. Filament diameters exceeded those reported for the modern species, but covered a similarly wide size range. Narrower frequently branching filaments, 4 – 8 l m in diameter, resemble distal branching patterns of modern Ostreobium quekettii. Some very thin filaments (ca. 1 – 2 l m) observed within skeleton or inside the large tubular filaments, sometimes associated with globular swellings, may represent euendolithic fungi. The recrystallization of coral skeleton had limited effect on preservation of euendoliths due to their impregnation with iron oxides; microbial euendoliths were subjected to different taphonomic changes...|$|R
50|$|Metridium farcimen {{is a large}} sea anemone, {{occasionally}} {{reaching a}} height of one metre (39 in) when fully extended. More usually it is 50 cm or less in height but is very variable in shape. It can retract its tentacles and form a ball up to 25 cm in diameter. The column is slender, smooth and studded with acontia. These are openings through which thread-like nematocysts from inside the body wall can protrude. There are no tubercles and the column is topped by a parapet. The oral disc is lobed and deeply convoluted at the edge and bears well over 100 <b>fine,</b> short, <b>tapering</b> tentacles. The colour is generally opaque white, but orange, salmon and brown specimens sometimes occur. Large specimens have been seen to have long, thick, fighting tentacles, used to drive away other anemones trying to settle too close. In large colonies that all emanate from one individual by cloning, individuals {{on the edge of}} the colony may have several of these fighting tentacles on their lips which they use to repel other, non-clonal anemones. Metridium farcimen might be confused with Metridium senile which occupies the same habitat and has a similar colour and form, but that species seldom exceeds 10 cm in height, has fewer than 100 tentacles and has an unlobed oral disc.|$|R
50|$|Most {{soldering}} irons for electronics have interchangeable tips, {{also known}} as bits, that vary in size and shape for different types of work. Pyramid tips with a triangular flat face and chisel tips with a wide flat face are useful for soldering sheet metal. <b>Fine</b> conical or <b>tapered</b> chisel tips are typically used for electronics work. Tips may be straight or have a bend. Concave or wicking tips with a chisel face with a concave well in the flat face to hold {{a small amount of}} solder are available. Tip selection depends upon the type of work and access to the joint; soldering of 0.5mm pitch surface-mount ICs, for example, is quite different from soldering a through-hole connection to a large area. A concave tip well is said to help prevent bridging of closely spaced leads; different shapes are recommended to correct bridging that has occurred. Due to patent restrictions not all manufacturers offer concave tips everywhere; in particular there are restrictions in the USA.|$|R

Following this, each root surface was thoroughly planed and flattened with a <b>fine</b> diamond <b>tapered</b> bur to expose the underlying dentin. Each root was then sectioned longitudinally into 6 equal parts and, using a N° 3 round bur in a high speed hand piece with copious water coolant, a horizontal shallow groo-ve was made in an apico-coronal direction on the pul-pal surface of every root for identification purposes.

This is, or soon will be, the Achilles, iron armour-plated ship. Twelve hundred men are working at her now; twelve hundred men working on stages over her sides, over her bows, over her stern, under her keel, between her decks, down in her hold, within her and without, {{crawling}} and creeping into the finest curves of her lines wherever {{it is possible for}} men to twist. Twelve hundred hammerers, measurers, caulkers, armourers, forgers, smiths, shipwrights; twelve hundred dingers, clashers, dongers, rattlers, clinkers, bangers bangers bangers! Yet all this stupendous uproar around the rising Achilles is as nothing to the reverberations with which the perfected Achilles shall resound upon the dreadful day when the full work is in hand for which this is but note of preparation--the day when the scuppers that are now fitting like great, dry, thirsty conduit-pipes, shall run red. All these busy figures between decks, dimly seen bending at their work in smoke and fire, are as nothing to the figures that shall do work here of another kind in smoke and fire, that day. These steam-worked engines alongside, helping the ship by travelling to and fro, and wafting tons of iron plates about, as though they were so many leaves of trees, would be rent limb from limb if they stood by her for a minute then. To think that this Achilles, monstrous compound of iron tank and oaken chest, can ever swim or roll! To think that any force of wind and wave could ever break her! To think that wherever I see a glowing red-hot iron point thrust out of her side from within--as I do now, there, and there, and there!--and two watching men on a stage without, with bared arms and sledge-hammers, strike at it fiercely, and repeat their blows until it is black and flat, I see a rivet being driven home, of which there are many in every iron plate, and thousands upon thousands in the ship! To think that the difficulty I experience in appreciating the ship's size when I am on board, arises from her being a series of iron tanks and oaken chests, so that internally she is ever finishing and ever beginning, and half of her might be smashed, and yet the remaining half suffice and be sound. Then, to go over the side again and down among the ooze and wet {{to the bottom of the}} dock, in the depths of the subterranean forest of dog-shores and stays that hold her up, and to see the immense mass bulging out against the upper light, and tapering down towards me, is, with great pains and much clambering, to arrive at an impossibility of realising that this is a ship at all, and to become possessed by the fancy that it is an enormous immovable edifice set up in an ancient amphitheatre (say, that at Verona), and almost filling it! Yet what would even these things be, without the tributary workshops and the mechanical powers for piercing the iron plates--four inches and a half thick--for rivets, shaping them under hydraulic pressure to the <b>finest</b> <b>tapering</b> turns of the ship's lines, and paring them away, with knives shaped like the beaks of strong and cruel birds, to the nicest requirements of the design! These machines of tremendous force, so easily directed by one attentive face and presiding hand, seem to me to have in them something of the retiring character of the Yard. 'Obedient monster, please to bite this mass of iron through and through, at equal distances, where these regular chalk-marks are, all round.' Monster looks at its work, and lifting its ponderous head, replies, 'I don't particularly want to do it; but if it must be done--!' The solid metal wriggles out, hot from the monster's crunching tooth, and it IS done. 'Dutiful monster, observe this other mass of iron. It is required to be pared away, according to this delicately lessening and arbitrary line, which please to look at.' Monster (who has been in a reverie) brings down its blunt head, and, much in the manner of Doctor Johnson, closely looks along the line--very closely, being somewhat near-sighted. 'I don't particularly want to do it; but if it must be done--!' Monster takes another near-sighted look, takes aim, and the tortured piece writhes off, and falls, a hot, tight-twisted snake, among the ashes. The making of the rivets is merely a pretty round game, played by a man and a boy, who put red-hot barley sugar in a Pope Joan board, and immediately rivets fall out of window; but the tone of the great machines is the tone of the great Yard and the great country: 'We don't particularly want to do it; but if it must be done--!' ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThe leptospiral infections {{from the}} aspects of the {{characteristics}} of the aetiologic agents, pathogenicity, immunity, diagnosis, treatment and epidemiology have been discussed. The type organism (Leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae) which belongs to the order Spirochaetales and family Treponemataceae is a strikingly flexible, motile microorganism measuring seven to fourteen microns in length with exceptionally long forms measuring from thirty to forty microns due to delayed transverse fission. The organisms are finely coiled with regular spirals measuring 0. 45 to 0. 5 micron in amplitude, and 0. 3 micron in depth. There are one of more undulations throughout the entire length and the body culminates in finely pointed ends. The organism may be demonstrated as a <b>fine</b> <b>tapering</b> filament which may assume the forms of semicircles, figures-of-eight, and S-shapes from a liquid culture medium, and serpentine, undulating or bent forms from a semi-solid medium. The leptospira may be stained by Giemsa's or Fontana's silver impregnation methods. The leptospi rae are morphologically undistinguishable. They are facultative aerobes and require {{one or more of the}} thermolabile factors in the serum of rabbits, horses, guinea-pigs or humans for growth. Optimal growth occurs at a pH of 7. 2 and a temperature range from thirty to thirty-seven degrees Centigrade. The pathogenic leptospirae live exclusively on proteins. Optimum growth requires a period of seven days to reach its peak in contrast to twenty-four hours for most of the other microorganisms. The media in use today are either liquid or semi-solid that contain a 10 per cent concentration of suitable animal serum and are buffered to a pH of 7. 2. Examples of these are Schuffner's liquid and Chang's (1947) semi-solid media. Studies of the antigenicity of the leptospirae show that they may arbitrarily be placed into two groups. The first group is called the Cosmopolitan group, which includes Leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae, Leptospira canicola, and Leptospira grippotyphosa. The second group is called the Far East Group, which includes Leptospira auturnnalis, Leptospira hebidomadis, and Leptospira febrilis (Leptospira pyrogenes). The organisms are all antigenically related since they show varying degrees of antigen-antibody reactions in their heterologous antisera. One species of leptospirae (Leptospira piflexa) is unique in its non-pathogenicity, simple growth requirements, and distinct antigenicity. The pathogenicity of the two groups of leptospirae depends upon the species (and even strains) in question and the host infected. The wild rat (Rattus species) is an asymptomatic host of the organisms. The organisms attack the liver, kidneys, and capillaries causing icterus, uremia, and haemorrhage in the susceptible host. Guinea-pigs, hamsters, and young albino mice (Mus musculus) are susceptible hosts to Leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae, and Leptospira canicola. They may be used as test animals for diagnosis of these agents. Lepto-spira canicola and Leptospira grippotyphosa, and the miscellaneous leptospirae of Asia seldom show icterus or the severe symptoms t hat the other leptospiral agents demonstrate in man and test animals. In leptospiral infections, the aetiological agent may be demonstrated in the blood during the primary toxemic stage. The organisms are found in the liver and kidneys in the secondary stage. This stage is manifested by icterus, hemorrhage into the subcutaneous tissues, and uremia. Postmortarn examination shows hemorrhages of the internal organs. Agglutinins may be demonstrated in the tertiary stage (seventh to twentieth day of infection), and can be detected in incr easing titers for weeks thereafter. Lasting immunity is established after an attack, and agglutinins have been detected as long as twenty years after the initial infection. The diagnostic agglutinin titer is 1 : 300 and may run as high as 1 : 30, 000. Diagnosis of a leptospiral infection is confirmed by darkfield examination or culture of the blood during the primary stage. Inoculation of emulsions of kidney or liver from infected hosts into test animals will reproduce the disease. Antibodies may be detected during convalescent and latent periods. Effective treatment must be started before the onset of icterus for the best therapeutic response. Serum therapy has been used experimentally to protect guinea-pigs, hamsters and young white mice (Mus musculus) from infection. Penicillin in concentrations of 0. 4 u/ml. has been shown to have a leptospiristatic effect on the organisms in vitro. Leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae has been shown to have a sensitivity variance to 0. 1 - 70. 5 u. /ml. of penicillin when tested in vitro. Leptospira grippotyphosa was found to be sensitive to 0. 25 u. /ml., Leptospira canicola to 0. 5 u. /ml., and Leptospira bataviae to 0. 1 u. /ml. when tested in vitro. Guinea-pigs have been effectively treated against Leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae when 1500 units of penicillin a day was given early and in maintained doses. General treatment consists of intravenous fluids and the administration of agents that will ameliorate the symptoms. Leptospirosis is endemic in Japan, Holland, South Central Europe, England, and in parts of the United States. The disease prevails in groups that are in proximity to the infective agents. Lepta-spira canicola infects dogs and those who are closely associated with dogs, i. e., veterinarians, and dog owners. Weil' s disease is seen in persons who are in proximity to infected rats. Leptospira grippotyphosa and Leptospira hebdomadis are neted among field workers who contact the disease from infective soil. Wild rats (Rattus species) have been shown to be infected with Leptospira icterohaemorrhagia in incidences of ten to thirty per cent from surveys conducted in Japan, Holland, England, and some of the major cities in the United States. Prophylactic measures should include rat proofing and extermination. Occupational groups should wear gloves to protect themselves from leptospirae-containing urine. Field workers should protect their feet with boots. Rat excreta may be sterilized with sodium hypochlorite 1 : 64. Health education should be stressed in endemic areas...|$|R
