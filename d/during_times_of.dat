5|$|The companions, {{including}} the elite companion cavalry and pezhetairoi infantry, represented a substantially larger group than the king's bodyguards.

Nelson tentatively explains these disjunct populations in terms of natural climate fluctuations: <b>during</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> higher rainfall, the distribution of A.obovatus {{would have been much}} more extensive.
