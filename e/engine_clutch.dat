50|$|BYD {{calls the}} F3DM is a {{dual-mode}} vehicle {{because it allows}} the driver to manually switch from all-electric to plug-in hybrid operation. The hybrid powertrain uses a 1.0-liter engine with battery-assisted acceleration at low speeds and the gasoline <b>engine</b> <b>clutches</b> to drive the wheels when more power is required. The estimated fuel economy is 30 mpg.|$|R

50|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>clutch</b> and gearbox were {{insulated}} as one assembly {{from the}} chassis by live rubber, there being two suspension points {{in front and}} one {{at the back of}} the gearbox. Silencer and exhaust system were insulated from the chassis by rubber mounting.|$|E

50|$|The OPOC engine can be moduled with two, or more, engines coupled via an {{electric}} <b>clutch</b> between <b>engines.</b> When more power is needed the second <b>engine</b> is <b>clutched</b> in. When clutched {{out of service}} there are no friction or pumping losses from the second engine module. This arrangement in city running vehicles could have a small, highly economical engine as the prime engine and when accelerating hard, or pulling heavy loads, the second, or more, <b>engines</b> are <b>clutched</b> into service.|$|R
50|$|The {{frame was}} made of very stiff section steel. A {{subframe}} was provided to make the <b>engine</b> <b>clutch</b> and gearbox one unit. By the standards of its day the chassis was entirely orthodox but it was of first class quality and provided excellent reliability.|$|E
5000|$|... a {{sub-frame}} for the <b>engine</b> <b>clutch</b> and gearbox at {{two points}} rigidly {{bolted to the}} front cross-member but resting at its back end in a circular rubber pad borne by the middle cross-member. This is to isolate the frame and body from noise from the gearbox and vibration from the other machinery.|$|E
50|$|At {{the front}} of the car was the <b>engine,</b> <b>clutch,</b> gearbox and a short stiff {{propeller}} shaft to the worm and spur driven differential and front wheel brake. All these mechanicals were (flexibly) mounted as one unit positioned in a reverse to the usual order, the differential at the very front of the car.|$|E

50|$|On July 7, 2005, BC Ferries {{concluded}} that a missing cotter pin was to blame. The pin normally retained a nut on a linkage between an engine speed governor and the fuel control {{for one of the}} engines. Without the pin, the nut fell off and the linkage separated, causing the <b>engine,</b> <b>clutches,</b> and propellers to increase in speed until overspeed safety devices tripped and shut down the entire propulsion system. The faulty speed governor had been serviced 17 days before the incident during a $35-million upgrade, and the cotter pin had not been properly replaced at that time.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>clutch</b> and gearbox {{were held}} {{as a unit}} at three points. There was a single plate clutch, its housing cast in one piece with the gearbox, a four-speed gearbox and an {{enclosed}} drive shaft taking power to the spiral bevel final drive. The gear lever, adjustable for reach, was positioned by the driver's right hand.|$|E
5000|$|The B 611 {{sat on a}} ladder-frame steel chassis with {{transverse}} reinforcement bars. At the front independent suspension used laterally mounted wishbones with coil springs. At the back a rigid [...] "swing" [...] axle was suspended with longitudinally mounted leaf springs. The <b>engine,</b> <b>clutch,</b> transmission, radiator and front suspension were all supported by an additional subframe.|$|E
50|$|Meadows {{had started}} by making {{gearboxes}} in 1920, initially for lorries {{made by the}} Vulcan Motor & Engineering Co and then Coventry Climax Ltd. After engines were introduced in 1922 they sold complete <b>engine,</b> <b>clutch,</b> and gearbox packages, initially with either 3 or 4 speed gearboxes, and later with 4 or 5 speed gearboxes. During the early 1950s, Meadows supplied gearboxes for the Jowett Javelin car.|$|E

50|$|The {{main gearbox}} was located behind {{the cabin and}} {{connected}} to the <b>engine</b> <b>clutch</b> housing via a short uni joint shaft (this design enables the so-called flat floor cabin) which was bolted together with the auxiliary gearbox to the backbone tube and formed {{the main part of}} the chassis structure. Options for rear power take off and winch drive were also possible. The main and auxiliary gears were fully synchronized except the first and reverse gear.|$|E
5000|$|The {{company was}} a descendent {{of the earlier}} Schaudel marque, which was noted for the {{development}} of an innovative engine design which combined the <b>engine,</b> <b>clutch</b> and gearbox in a single main casing. Unfortunately, this made it so that engine oil would seep into the transmission. Schaudel constructed automobiles from 1900 to 1902, and in June 1902 [...] "la Societe Anonyme des automobiles Motobloc" [...] was established to continue vehicle production based on the Schaudel designs.|$|E

30|$|All of the {{discussed}} prognostics applications {{were just}} examples, whereas the prognostics applications {{could not be}} counted. Prognostics is widely used and applied in several engineering areas such as unmanned aerial vehicle propulsion, military aircraft turbofan oil systems, semiconductor manufacturing, cracks in rotating machinery, heating, air conditioning, wheeled mobile robots, electronics, gas turbines, actuators, aerospace structures, aircraft <b>engines,</b> <b>clutch</b> systems, batteries, bearings, and hydraulic pumps and motors. Prognostics is also involved in many projects related to the nuclear industry due to its criticality, e.g., nuclear plant life prediction NULIFE [4]. As the prognostics technology is improving, {{in the near future}} it will be part of almost all systems, from the very complex ones to household equipment.|$|R
50|$|The {{first attempt}} to produce a fleet {{submarine}} was the , later renamed the T class, launched 1918-19. These produced a high speed with four <b>engines</b> <b>clutched</b> together in tandem pairs. This design resulted in excessive vibration and engine damage, and the class was decommissioned in the 1920s and scrapped in 1930. The second attempt was the Barracuda class; the first three V-boats, launched 1924-25. These combined large direct drive main diesels with small diesel-electric diesels to achieve 21 knots. Their engines, built by the Bureau of Steam Engineering (BuEng) based on German MAN designs, were unreliable and the boats had poor seakeeping qualities. They were decommissioned in 1937 and saw only limited service, mostly training and experimental, in World War II.|$|R
