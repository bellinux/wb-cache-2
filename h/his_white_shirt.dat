500|$|In 1942, Selznick {{liquidated}} {{his company}} for tax reasons, and sold his share in Gone with the Wind to his business partner, John Whitney, for $500,000. In turn, Whitney sold {{it on to}} MGM for $2.8 million, so that the studio owned the film outright. MGM immediately re-released the film in spring 1942, and again in 1947 and 1954; the 1954 reissue {{was the first time}} the film was shown in widescreen, compromising the original Academy ratio and cropping the top and bottom to an aspect ratio of 1.75:1. In doing so, a number of shots were optically re-framed and cut into the three-strip camera negatives, forever altering five shots in the film. A 1961 release commemorated the centennial anniversary of the start of the Civil War, and included a gala [...] "premiere" [...] at the Loew's Grand Theater. It was attended by Selznick and many other stars of the film, including Vivien Leigh and Olivia de Havilland; Clark Gable had died the previous year. For its 1967 re-release, it was blown up to 70mm, and issued with updated poster artwork featuring Gable—with <b>his</b> <b>white</b> <b>shirt</b> ripped open—holding Leigh against a backdrop of orange flames. There were further re-releases in 1971, 1974 and 1989; for the fiftieth anniversary reissue in 1989, it was given a complete audio and video restoration. It was released theatrically one more time in the United States, in 1998. In 2013, a 4K digital restoration was released in the United Kingdom to coincide with Vivien Leigh's centenary. In 2014, special screenings were scheduled over a two-day period at theaters across the United States to coincide with the film's 75th anniversary.|$|E
60|$|Macartney, the land-broker, sat {{opposite}} him, a gaunt, keen-eyed man, {{with a thin}} {{jacket over}} <b>his</b> <b>white</b> <b>shirt.</b> Leland knew him for an upright man, though nobody {{is supposed to be}} particularly scrupulous in the business he followed.|$|E
60|$|Presently he appeared. <b>His</b> <b>white</b> <b>shirt</b> {{had been}} soiled by dust and grease. There was chaff in his fair hair. In one grimy hand {{he held a}} large monkey-wrench. What struck Lenore most was the {{piercing}} intensity of his gaze as he fixed it upon her father.|$|E

50|$|Ellena's father, brother, and {{daughter}} Celine are also perfumers. Known for <b>his</b> signature <b>white</b> <b>shirts,</b> Ellena himself never wears perfume or cologne.His daughter Celine having designed the Parfum La Maison, or Home Fragrance Collection.|$|R
60|$|He {{checked her}} with a gesture. What a gentleman of the old school he was, with <b>his</b> <b>white</b> ruffled <b>shirt</b> and <b>his</b> black stock and his eye {{kindling}} with charity.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hollo! {{what did}} you put out the light for?' he angrily answered; and as she could just {{distinguish}} <b>his</b> <b>white</b> <b>shirt</b> sleeves, she sprang to him. Steps went hurriedly down the stairs. 'Gone!' they both cried at once; Mervyn, with an imprecation on the darkness, adding, 'Go and ring the bell. I'll watch here.' ...|$|E
60|$|Jackson wiped a spot {{of liquor}} from <b>his</b> <b>white</b> <b>shirt</b> and gave the boy a {{sympathetic}} glance. Jackson was thin, dark-skinned and grave, and {{although he did not}} talk much about himself, Jimmy understood he was rather an important gentleman in Carolina. Stannard had indicated something like this. Stannard and Jimmy were frankly English, but Jimmy was young and the other's hair was touched by white.|$|E
60|$|He {{went back}} to the office with an anxious heart, and a few minutes later he stood beside a camp bed in his son’s quarters. He had lost his hat, his city coat was torn to rags, and <b>his</b> <b>white</b> <b>shirt</b> was stained with blood from the gash in his cheek; but he was {{unconscious}} of all this. Aynsley lay there, breathing feebly, with a drawn, white face and a small blue mark on his uncovered breast, while an ominous red froth gathered about his lips.|$|E
60|$|When Charnock stopped, a {{man without}} a coat and with the sleeves of <b>his</b> fine <b>white</b> <b>shirt</b> rolled up came out. He as rather an old man and his {{movements}} were slack; his face was hard, {{but on the whole}} expressionless.|$|R
5000|$|He was {{recognized}} by the Smithsonian Institution, which put one of <b>his</b> trademark <b>white</b> <b>shirts</b> and red ties on display. When he handed the shirt to the museum's curator, Rodney joked, [...] "I have a feeling you're {{going to use this}} to clean Lindbergh's plane." ...|$|R
50|$|Along {{with this}} magical cloak, Fighting Yank's outfit also {{included}} a tri-corner hat, square buckles, an American flag on <b>his</b> chest, a <b>white</b> <b>shirt,</b> and blue pants.|$|R
60|$|Syme {{had been}} haunted by a half {{historic}} memory {{in connection with}} these empty rooms and that austere daybreak. The moment he saw the garret and Dr. Bull sitting writing at a table, he remembered what the memory was--the French Revolution. There {{should have been the}} black outline of a guillotine against that heavy red and white of the morning. Dr. Bull was in <b>his</b> <b>white</b> <b>shirt</b> and black breeches only; his cropped, dark head might well have just come out of its wig; he might have been Marat or a more slipshod Robespierre.|$|E
60|$|As {{he gazed}} into the darkness, a {{measured}} sound stole {{out of the}} mist, and, growing louder, suggested a galloping horse. It approached the mill, but Aynsley did not go down. If anybody wanted him, {{it would be better}} that he should be found quietly at work in his office; and he was seated at his table with a pen in his hand when a man was shown in. The newcomer was neatly dressed except that <b>his</b> <b>white</b> <b>shirt</b> was damp and crumpled. His face was hot and determined.|$|E
60|$|She was obeyed. The women moved on; and George and Grant {{managed to}} enter the hotel behind them before the throng closed in. The big general-room was hot and its {{atmosphere}} almost intolerably foul; the bar, which opened off it, was shadowy, and the crowded figures of lounging men showed dimly through thick cigar smoke. The hum of their voices died away {{and there was a}} curious silence as the women came in. Edging forward, George saw Beamish leaning on his counter, looking quietly self-possessed and very dapper in <b>his</b> <b>white</b> <b>shirt</b> and well-cut clothes.|$|E
60|$|This one swung {{himself off}} the box-seat with the alacrity {{of a man who}} has no doubts about the upshot of the quarrel, and after hanging his caped coat upon the swingle-bar, he daintily turned up the ruffled cuffs of <b>his</b> <b>white</b> cambric <b>shirt.</b>|$|R

50|$|Percy {{maintains}} a constant physical appearance with <b>his</b> <b>white</b> tee <b>shirt</b> and blue jeans. He disregards {{the weather and}} these items of clothing are worn {{no matter what the}} temperature is. It is revealed Percy has blond hair when Ruby retells the story of the nativity scene that Lily painted for the church. He also wears glasses.|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} {{we came upon}} {{the scene of the}} struggle. Colonel Despienne and the man whom we had shot lay {{together}} some distance down the road, while their horses grazed contentedly beneath the poplars. Captain Tremeau lay in front of us upon his back, with his arms and legs stretched out, and his sabre broken short off in his hand. His tunic was open, and a huge blood-clot hung like a dark handkerchief out of a slit in <b>his</b> <b>white</b> <b>shirt.</b> I could see the gleam of his clenched teeth from under his immense moustache.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{impossible}} to cheat away the moments any longer. I sat down and listened. A distant roar of welcome, {{like that of a}} wave breaking over a wreck, had been borne across as the band broke into its welcoming tune. I saw the ring, its tall, lank-cheeked [...] "master" [...] in <b>his</b> <b>white</b> <b>shirt</b> and coat-tails, the lights, the sidling, squalling clown, and the slim, exquisite creature with its ungainly rider ambling on and on. Where sat Fanny amidst that rabble? What were her thoughts? Was Mrs Monnerie already yawning over the low, beggarly scene? A few minutes now. I began to count. A scream, human or animal, rose faint and awful in the distance, and died away.|$|E
60|$|He had, as it happened, a {{troublesome}} {{matter to}} decide on, and seeing {{no way out}} of the difficulties which complicated it, he rose at length, and, lighting a cigar, opened the outer door and stood leaning against it. It was cooler there, and he noticed that the night was unusually dark. The stream of light that flowed out past him, forcing up his figure in a sharp, black silhouette, only intensified the thick obscurity in which it was almost immediately lost. It was also very still, and he could hear <b>his</b> <b>white</b> <b>shirt</b> crackle at each slight movement of the hand that held the cigar. Everybody in the little wooden town was, he surmised, already asleep, though he knew that a west-bound train would stop there in half an hour or so.|$|E
50|$|Because of the show's limited budget, Spider-Man's costume {{only has}} webbed areas on his head, arms and boots; {{the rest is}} plain, except for spiders {{on his chest and}} back. The series relied on reused stock animation, {{including}} Spider-Man swinging across the New York City skyline and Peter stripping off <b>his</b> <b>white</b> dress <b>shirt</b> to reveal his spider suit. Character movement was also minimized.|$|R
50|$|Ghede Masaka assists Ghede Nibo. He is an {{androgynous}} or transgender male gravedigger {{and spirit}} of the dead, recognized by <b>his</b> black <b>shirt,</b> <b>white</b> jacket, and white headscarf.|$|R
60|$|This one {{was dark}} {{instead of being}} fair like the other; but he was as big. He was without his coat and waistcoat; he had been doubtless snoozing in the rocking-chair which stood in a corner furthest from the window. Above the great bulk of <b>his</b> {{crumpled}} <b>white</b> <b>shirt,</b> buttoned with three diamond studs, his round face looked swarthy. It was moist; his brown moustache hung limp and ragged. He pushed a common, cane-bottomed chair towards me with his foot.|$|R
60|$|Sakr-el-Bahr was in {{the very}} prime of life, a man of a great length of body, with a deep Herculean torso and limbs that advertised a giant strength. His hawk-nosed face ending in a black forked beard was of a swarthiness accentuated to exaggeration by the snowy white turban wound about his brow. His eyes, by contrast, were {{singularly}} light. He wore over <b>his</b> <b>white</b> <b>shirt</b> a long green tunic of very light silk, woven along its edges with arabesques in gold; a pair of loose calico breeches reached to his knees; his brown muscular calves were naked, and his feet were shod {{in a pair of}} Moorish shoes of crimson leather, with up-curling and very pointed toes. He had no weapons other than the heavy-bladed knife with a jewelled hilt that was thrust into his girdle of plaited leather.|$|E
60|$|The Borgo La Croce was so still, {{that she}} listened to her own {{footsteps}} on the pavement in the sunny silence, until, on approaching {{a bend in the}} street, she saw, a few yards before her, a little child not more than three years old, with no other clothing than <b>his</b> <b>white</b> <b>shirt,</b> pause from a waddling run and look around him. In the first moment of coming nearer she could only see his back--a boy's back, square and sturdy, with a cloud of reddish-brown curls above it; but in the next he turned towards her, and she could see his dark eyes wide with tears, and his lower lip pushed up and trembling, while his fat brown fists clutched his shirt helplessly. The glimpse of a tall black figure sending a shadow over him brought his bewildered fear to a climax, and a loud crying sob sent the big tears rolling.|$|E
60|$|At {{this order}} a lay-brother swung open the door, {{and two other}} lay-brothers entered leading between them a young novice of the order. He {{was a man of}} huge stature, dark-eyed and red-headed, with a {{peculiar}} half-humorous, half-defiant expression upon his bold, well-marked features. His cowl was thrown back upon his shoulders, and his gown, unfastened at the top, disclosed a round, sinewy neck, ruddy and corded like the bark of the fir. Thick, muscular arms, covered with a reddish down, protruded from the wide sleeves of his habit, while <b>his</b> <b>white</b> <b>shirt,</b> looped up upon one side, gave a glimpse of a huge knotty leg, scarred and torn with the scratches of brambles. With a bow to the Abbot, which had in it perhaps more pleasantry than reverence, the novice strode across to the carved prie-dieu which had been set apart for him, and stood silent and erect with his hand upon the gold bell which was used in the private orisons of the Abbot's own household. His dark eyes glanced rapidly over the assembly, and finally settled with a grim and menacing twinkle upon the face of his accuser.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2016, fashion {{designer}} turned textile artist Benny Ong, {{in collaboration with}} a family of master Laotian weavers, presented The Pioneering Spirit at Raffles Hotel, an exhibition of 21 woven textiles, including the S$10,000 [...] "The Shirt", featuring Lee in <b>his</b> iconic <b>white</b> <b>shirt</b> {{in the shape of}} Singapore. In the same month, at Art Stage Singapore, hyper-realist artist M Fadhlil Abdi exhibited The Guardian, an oil-on-canvas portrait of Lee at the Art Xchange Gallery booth. At the same show, Sundaram Tagore Gallery exhibited Lee Waisler's portrait of Lee.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Ong made {{the switch from}} fashion {{designing}} to contemporary textile art. In 2007, he presented the exhibition Re-woven at the Singapore Art Museum. It comprised 46 pieces of silk textiles based {{on the art of}} Lao weaving. In 2015, Ong received the Singapore Design Golden Jubilee Award. In January 2016, Ong, in collaboration with a family of master Laotian weavers, presented The Pioneering Spirit at Raffles Hotel, an exhibition of 21 woven textiles, including the S$10,000 [...] "The Shirt", featuring Lee Kuan Yew in <b>his</b> iconic <b>white</b> <b>shirt</b> in the shape of Singapore.|$|R
5000|$|The {{movie was}} shot {{on a tight}} budget. Dominic Dierkes {{mentioned}} on the DVD commentary and on tour stops that lighting problems forced a wardrobe change for his character. Dierkes said <b>his</b> initially <b>white</b> <b>shirt</b> reflected light that appeared to glow when viewed on screen. With several early [...] "white shirt" [...] scenes already shot, and not having the budget to reshoot them, the members of Derrick opted to write in a gag in which Dierkes spilled chocolate milk and used the shirt as a rag, forcing him {{to switch to a}} red shirt {{for the remainder of the}} movie.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{stood the}} Count in <b>his</b> <b>white</b> <b>shirt</b> in the pose of a statue. And {{when it was}} seen that Richter {{likewise}} had no protection, but was calmly smoking the little short pipe, with a charred bowl, a hush fell upon all. At {{the sight of the}} pipe von Kalbach ground his heel in the turf, and when the word was given he rushed at Richter like a wild beast. You, my friend, who have never heard the whistle of sharp Schlager cannot know the song which a skilled arm draws from the blade. It was music that morning: You should have seen the noble's mighty strokes--'Prim und Second und Terz und Quart'. You would have marked how Richter met him at every blow. Von Kalbach never once took his eyes from the blue smoke from the bowl. He was terrible in his fury, and I shiver now to think how we of the Burschenschaft trembled when we saw that our champion was driven back a step, and then another. You must know that it is a lasting disgrace to be forced over one's own line. It seemed as if we could not bear the agony. And then, while we counted out the last seconds of the half, came a snap like that of a whip's lash, and the bowl of Richter's pipe lay smouldering on the grass. The noble had cut the stem as clean as it were sapling twig, and there stood Richter with the piece still clenched in his teeth, his eyes ablaze, and his cheek running blood. He pushed the surgeon away when he came forward with his needles. The Count was smiling as he put up his sword, his friends crowding around him, when Ebhardt cried out that his man could fight the second mensur,--though the wound was three needles long. Then Kalbach cried aloud that he would kill him. But he had not seen Carl's eyes. Something was in them that made us think as we washed the cut. But when we spoke to him he said nothing. Nor could we force the pipe stems from his teeth.|$|E

The loss of the shirt is to take on greater metaphorical meaning as the film progresses which is inspired by the director's own experience as a youth during the cultural revolution and the more general confusion of childhood.|$|E
50|$|While {{playing for}} England in a vital World Cup {{qualifier}} in Sweden in September 1989, Butcher suffered a deep cut {{to his forehead}} early in the game. Butcher had some impromptu stitches inserted by the physiotherapist and, swathed in bandages, continued playing. His constant heading of the ball - unavoidable when playing in the centre of defence - disintegrated the bandages and reopened the cut {{to the extent that}} <b>his</b> <b>white</b> England <b>shirt</b> was red with blood {{by the end of the}} game. This match is often used when referencing Butcher even today.|$|R
5000|$|Lisa {{wakes up}} Bart {{to remind him}} that her {{birthday}} is nearing, and that he forgets it every year. Bart promises to get her a present this year. Meanwhile, Homer discovers that all of <b>his</b> <b>white</b> <b>shirts</b> have turned pink because Bart put his red hat in with the laundry. Homer {{has no choice but}} to wear a pink shirt to work and as a result, his co-workers poke fun at him. Mr. Burns suspects him of being a [...] "free-thinking anarchist". Homer is sent home with a 20-question psychiatric quiz that he has to fill in so that Dr. Marvin Monroe can assess his sanity. Homer is too lazy to finish the quiz on his own and lets Bart fill it in. When Dr. Monroe sees the results, he determines that Homer is insane. Homer is sent to a mental institution, and is put in a cell with a large white man who seems to believe he is Michael Jackson (referred to as [...] "the big white guy who thinks he's the little black guy"), and who introduces himself as such. Apparently, somehow never having heard of Michael Jackson, Homer believes him and quickly befriends him.|$|R
