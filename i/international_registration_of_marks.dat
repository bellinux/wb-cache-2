50|$|The Madrid system (officially the Madrid {{system for}} the <b>{{international}}</b> <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>marks)</b> is the primary international system for facilitating the registration of trademarks in multiple jurisdictions around the world. Its legal basis is the multilateral treaty Madrid Agreement Concerning the <b>International</b> <b>Registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Marks</b> of 1891, {{as well as the}} Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement (1989).|$|E
50|$|The Madrid Protocol system {{provides}} for the <b>international</b> <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> trade <b>marks</b> by way <b>of</b> one application that can cover more than one country. The opportunity of having a single registration to cover {{a wide range of}} countries gives advantages, both in terms of portfolio management and cost savings, as opposed to a portfolio <b>of</b> independent national <b>registrations.</b>|$|R
40|$|The role <b>of</b> <b>marks</b> {{in the era}} of {{globalization}} of markets is very important, especially in maintaining fairbusiness competition and preventing piracy <b>of</b> <b>marks</b> that will be detrimental to the registered mark, bothdomestically and Internationally. Therefore, the business requires International trademark registrationprocedures in order to obtain legal protection in both countries of origin and in other countries where theexpansion of business is required. Along with the development of International trade, the need to protectthe International brand is also getting stronger. International conventions on the protection of brands arepresent in the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, Nice Agreement (Concerningthe International Classification of Goods and Services for the Purposes <b>of</b> the <b>Registration</b> <b>of</b> Marks),Madrid Agreement Concerning the <b>International</b> <b>Registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mark</b> and Madrid Protocol. The Madrid Protocol is an International treaty governing <b>International</b> trademark <b>registration,</b> with oneapplication, one language and one currency. The Madrid Protocol provides effective legal protection ofregistered marks and facilitates national brands into global brands able to compete with foreign <b>marks.</b> The ratification <b>of</b> the Madrid Protocol, expected to be done by the government, is a positive step insupporting the protection of domestic brands and is extensive and efficient; however, it requires goodhuman resource readiness, facilities and infrastructure such as technology to support effectiveimplementation of the Madrid Protocol in the protection of this brand...|$|R
40|$|At {{the core}} of every {{successful}} business are the trade marks the business uses to identify its goods or services. If properly protected, trade marks can last forever; and can provide the business with a unique and immediately visible identification to its customers and the world beyond. A trade mark cannot be protected by the law unless it is registered, since registration is considered as a basis of the legal protection. The Trade Marks Act 1969 together with its Rules organize all matters concerning <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> trade <b>marks</b> and provide the procedure to be followed in obtaining such registration. This thesis examines the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> trade <b>marks</b> in Sudan under the Trade Marks Act 1969. Chapter One highlights the historical development <b>of</b> the trade <b>marks</b> laws in the Sudan and discusses the definition <b>of</b> the trade <b>marks</b> under both the Trade Marks Ordinance 1931 and the Trade Marks Act 1969 and the various functions <b>of</b> the trade <b>marks.</b> The discussion in Chapter Two is mainly about the registrability <b>of</b> trade <b>mark.</b> Chapter Three concentrates on the procedure <b>of</b> <b>registration.</b> Since the Trade Marks Act 1969 has adopted the <b>international</b> <b>registration</b> system <b>of</b> trade <b>marks,</b> reference is made in this chapter to the international arrangements concerning this issue namely the Madrid Agreement and the Madrid Protocol. Chapter Four sheds lights on some essential matters concerning registration such as objection, cancellation, assignment and surrender. Lastly Chapter Five concludes the thesis with some recommendations hopefully to be adopted for better protection <b>of</b> trade <b>marks</b> achieved by registration...|$|R

40|$|During {{the second}} half of the twentieth century there was a general desire, as in other fields of law, for {{harmonization}} of the laws of industrial property on an international, and even worldwide, basis. This was due to the development of a more internationally oriented flow of technology and to the increase of international trade which made harmonization urgent in both the patent and trademark field. This led to the International Conference on Industrial Property held in Paris in 1880 which adopted a draft convention which contained in essence those substantive provisions which are still today the main features of the Paris Convention on the Protection of Industrial Property. The Paris Convention was signed by 11 states in Paris in 1883. It has been revised several times. The great majority of the more than 150 Member States are parties to the latest revision of Stockholm of 1967 and 1979. The Paris Convention was followed by a bunch of more particular international treaties dealing with more detailed aspects of industrial property rights as the Madrid Agreement Concerning the <b>International</b> <b>Registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Marks</b> 1891, the Madrid Agreement on the Repression of False or Deceptive Indications of Origin on Goods of 1891, the Lisbon Agreement on the Protection of Appellations of Origin of 1966, the Nice Agreement Concerning the International Classification of Goods and Services for the Purpose of the Registration of Marks of 1957, Strasbourg Agreement Concerning the International Patent Classification and so on. In {{the second half}} of the twentieth century the above mentioned harmonization activities went over to the integration efforts in the field of industrial property protection. The Patent Cooperation Treaty- PCT has been signed and came into force in 1978, the European Patent Convention of 1977, which established the European Patent Office in Munich. In the field of trademarks and designs the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market has been established. The aim of it is the registration of the Community Trademarks and Community Designs. The Czech Republic took part in the harmonization and integration activities from the very beginning. It s task has been successfully completed by access to the main international treaties in the field of industrial property protection, namely to the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Trademarks and to the Protocol to this Agreement, further to the Patent Cooperation Treaty and to the European Patent Convention. A quite new period of the integration process in this field comes in connection with our European Union membership. ...|$|E
40|$|Intellectual {{property}} {{refers to}} creations of the mind: inventions, literary and works of art, {{as well as}} symbols, names, images, and designs {{that are used in}} commerce. Intellectual property is divided into two categories industrial property, which includes inventions (patents), trademarks industrial designs, and geographic indications of source; and copyright which includes literary and works of art such as novels, poems and plays films, musical works, works of art such as drawings, paintings, photographs and sculptures, and architectural designs. Rights related to copyright include those of performing artists in their performances, producers of phonograms in their recordings, and those of broadcasters in their radio and television programmes. 1883 marked the birth of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, the first major international treaty designed to help the people from one country obtain protection in other countries for their intellectual creations in the form of industrial property rights, known as: inventions (patents), trademarks, industrial designs. In 1886, copyright entered the international arena with the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. The aim of this Convention was to help nationals of its member States obtain international protection of their right to control, and receive payment for the use of their creative works such as: novels, short stories, poems plays; songs, operas, musicals, sonatas; and drawings, paintings sculptures, architectural works. The Universal Copyright Convention (UCC) was adopted in 1952 and formalised in 1955, as a complementary agreement to the Berne Convention. The UCC membership included the United States, and many developing countries that did not wish to comply with the Berne Convention, since they viewed its provisions as overly favourable to the developed world. Patent Cooperation Treaty, signed on June 19, 1970, provides for the filing of a single international patent application which has the same effect as national applications filed in the designated countries. An applicant seeking protection may file one application and request protection in as many signatory states as needed. On November 6, 1925, the Hague Agreement Concerning the International Deposit of Industrial Designs was adopted {{within the framework of the}} Paris Convention. Under the provisions of the Hague Agreement, any person entitled to effect an international deposit has the possibility of obtaining, by means of a single deposit protection for his industrial designs in a number of States with a minimum of formalities and of expense. The system of <b>international</b> <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>marks</b> is governed by two treaties, the Madrid Agreement Concerning the <b>International</b> <b>Registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Marks,</b> which dates from 1891, and the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement that was adopted in 1989. It entered into force on December 1, 1995, and came into operation on April 1, 1996. The reason for adopting the much more recent Protocol, following the original Madrid Agreement of 1891 (last amended at Stockholm in 1967), was the absence from the Madrid Union of some of the major countries in the trademark field, for example, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. The Protocol is intended to make the Madrid system acceptable to more countries. The Rome Convention consists basically of the national treatment that a State grants under its domestic law to domestic performances, phonograms and broadcasts. Apart from the rights guaranteed by the Convention itself as constituting that minimum of protection, and subject to specific exceptions or reservations allowed for by the Convention, performers, producers of phonograms and broadcasting organisations to which the Convention applies, enjoy in Contracting States the same rights as those countries grant to their nationals. The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) is an international organisation dedicated to promoting the use and protection of works of the human spirit. These works, intellectual property, are expanding the bounds of science and technology and enriching the world of the arts. Through its work, WIPO plays an important role in enhancing the quality and enjoyment of life, as well as creating real wealth for nations. In 1974, WIPO became a specialised agency of the United Nations system of organisations, with a mandate to administer intellectual property matters recognised by the member states of the UN. With headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, WIPO is one of the 16 specialised agencies of the United Nations system of organisations. It administers 21 international treaties dealing with different aspects of intellectual property protection. The Organisation counts 177 nations as member states. One of the successes of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations was the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS Agreement), which came into effect on 1 January 1995, and up to date it the most comprehensive multilateral agreement on intellectual property. The TRIPS Agreement is a minimum standards agreement, which allows Members to provide more extensive protection of intellectual property if they wish so. Members are left free to determine the appropriate method of implementing the provisions of the Agreement within their own legal system and practice On January 1, 1996, an Agreement Between the World Intellectual Property Organization and the World Trade Organization entered into force. It provides for cooperation concerning the implementation of the TRIPS Agreement, such as notification of laws and regulations and legal-technical assistance and technical co-operation in favour of developing countries. In the 21 st century intellectual property will play an increasingly important role at the international stage. Works of the mind - intellectual property such as inventions, designs, trademarks, books, music, and films, are now used and enjoyed on every continent on the earth. In the new millennium international protection of intellectual property rights faces many new challenges; one of the most urgent is the need for states to adapt to and benefit from rapid and wide-ranging technological change, particularly in the field of information technology and the Internet...|$|E

40|$|Since 1967, Pro-Football has {{registered}} six marks {{that include}} the term “redskins,” a derogatory racial epithet that refers to Native Americans. The use <b>of</b> disparaging <b>marks</b> {{dates back to the}} 19 th century when brands commercialized racial stereotypes, such as Aunt Jemima. Today, offensive marks, including those that ridicule race, ethnicity, gender and religion are proliferating prompting the question of what role trademark law plays in protecting the interests of diverse communities. Section 2 (a) of the Lanham Act prohibits the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>marks</b> that consist <b>of</b> matter that may disparage or bring into contempt or disrepute any person, institution, or belief. In this chapter, I review the policy goals and challenges in barring the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> offensive <b>marks</b> and conclude that trademark law can play an important, albeit limited role in fostering diversity. U. S. trademark law only seeks to regulate the registration and not the use of offensive trademarks. Nevertheless, the symbolic gesture of the federal government cancelling the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> a <b>mark</b> on the basis that it disparages people is significant and may affect the way society views the mark. Thus the government can perform important signaling for civility without abridging the freedom of speech...|$|R
