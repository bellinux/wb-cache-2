5000|$|<b>Expansion</b> <b>Module</b> #2 is {{a driving}} {{controller}} (steering wheel / gas pedal) that came packaged with a port of the arcade game Turbo. The gas pedal {{is merely a}} simple on/off switch, so many gamers used the second ColecoVision controller as a gear shift for more precise speed control. Although Coleco called the driving controller an <b>expansion</b> <b>module,</b> it actually plugs into the controller port, not the <b>Expansion</b> <b>Module</b> Interface. The driving controller is also compatible with the games Destructor, Bump 'n' Jump, Pitstop, and The Dukes of Hazzard.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the shape}} of the Supercharger, it would not {{normally}} fit into the ColecoVision's <b>Expansion</b> <b>Module</b> #1, which is an adapter that allows the ColecoVision to play Atari 2600 games. However, if the cover of the <b>expansion</b> <b>module</b> is removed or an extender is used, the Supercharger will work. Extenders were sent to customers who called Starpath about such issues.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Expansion</b> <b>Module</b> #1 {{makes the}} ColecoVision {{compatible}} with the industry-leading Atari 2600, with some exceptions. Functionally, this gave the ColecoVision the largest software library of any console of its day. The <b>expansion</b> <b>module</b> prompted legal action from Atari, but Atari was unable to stop sales of the module because the 2600 could be reproduced with off the shelf parts. Coleco also designed and sold the Gemini game system, which was a clone of the 2600, but with combined joystick/paddle controllers.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on the design and {{production}} of teaching kits with <b>expansion</b> <b>modules</b> which are based on the Atmel AVR microcontroller. Kit consists of a plate containing processes and basic power modules directly on the board and <b>expansion</b> <b>modules</b> "SIMAČ". "SIMAČ" modules are virtual elements that simulate the real elements and they are commonly used in industrial automation. Because of their cost they are integrated in extension kit as programmable modules. It also contains basic theoretical information about working with ATMEL AVR microcontrollers. <b>Expansion</b> <b>modules</b> with module development board and disc which will be loaded all the schemes, programs and technical documentation for individual districts will be attached to the thesis...|$|R

50|$|The 2nd {{model in}} the Nexus 6000 series is a modular chassis, 4 Rack units high. The basic chassis offers 48 fixed QSFP+ ports at 40 Gbit/s each, each can be split in 4 x 10Gbit/s SFP+ ports. Besides the 48 QSFP+ ports the chassis can hold up to 4 <b>expansion</b> <b>modules</b> - each {{offering}} 12 additional 40Gbit/s QSFP+ ports - thus in total up to 96 QSFP+ ports or 384 SFP+/10Gbit/s ports and when aggregating FEX up to 1536 (blade)server ports at 1 or 10Gbit/s. As with the 6001 layer 2/layer 3 operation is at line-rate and total switching capacity of a chassis is 7,68Tbit/s. The Nexus 6004-EF switch is a modular device which provides the same features as the 6004 but {{with the use of}} <b>expansion</b> <b>modules</b> in all slots of the switch. The base configuration of the 6004-EF must have 2 x 12 port 40GbE <b>expansion</b> <b>modules,</b> delivering 24 ports of 40GbE or 96 ports of 10GbE. Additional capacity can be provided by installing further <b>expansion</b> <b>modules.</b>|$|R

5000|$|An {{expansion}} chassis was released, {{providing an}} additional 64 kB of paged memory. Since the Z80 has a 16-bit address bus, {{it can only}} address 64 kB of memory at a time. The paged memory system in the expansion chassis used bank switching to allow the NewBrain {{to take advantage of}} several 64 kB modules. The <b>expansion</b> <b>module</b> included a parallel printer port and two hardware based serial ports and an expansion bus to connect further modules such as the 8 and 16 way serial modules under development.
