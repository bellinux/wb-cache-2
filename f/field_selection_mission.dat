40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine whether varieties selected in <b>field</b> trials "field <b>selections</b> " and commercial varieties occurred amongst the lower yielding plants at the potted seedling stage. Total above ground mass was determined for each plant. Few selections or commercial varieties occurred in the lightest 30 and 50 % of the plants. In a third experiment, 2 680 original seedlings growing in pots were assessed by eye for vigour. Approximately 25 % of the least vigorous plants were classified as "discards". A sample of 400 of the discards was sent through the normal <b>field</b> <b>selection</b> programme together with the 2 010 plants regarded as selections. No clones from amongst the discards reached stage IV of the <b>field</b> <b>selection</b> programme. Also, at earlier stages the selections outyielded the discards. The individual stalks can be cut and used as seedcane (Thomas'). This present study was done to assess {{the degree to which}} potentially good varieties are likely to be lost if the least vigorous plants are discarded at the potted seedling stage. Materials and Methods Seedlings were started in trays before being transferred to pots. Airbricks served as convenient pots (see Fig 1), giving a plant spacing of approximately 100 x 100 mm. The seedlings for all the trials were grown for 7 - 8 months.
