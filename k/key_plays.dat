5|$|Early in {{the second}} quarter Alabama {{completed}} a 10-play, 58-yard drive by scoring on a two-yard run by backup tailback Trent Richardson. The <b>key</b> <b>plays</b> were a 15-yard pass from McElroy to Darius Hanks and a 13-yard pass from McElroy to Richardson. After an exchange of punts gave Alabama good starting position at the Auburn 45, the Tide quickly struck again with McElroy hitting tight end Colin Peek on a 33-yard touchdown pass that left the game tied 14–14 at halftime.|$|E
5|$|Supporting Ball and Johnson were a {{corps of}} capable {{receivers}} including James Johnson and Greg Smith. James Johnson was Tech's second-leading receiver behind Calvin Johnson, and recorded over 500 receiving yards {{heading into the}} ACC championship. During Tech's game against Virginia Tech, James caught a 49-yard touchdown pass for the game's first points. Smith was Tech's fifth-leading receiver in 2006, but had several <b>key</b> <b>plays</b> (including two touchdown receptions) in Georgia Tech's game against the Duke Blue Devils.|$|E
5|$|During the 2015–16 season, James {{was criticized}} {{for his role in}} several off-court controversies, {{including}} the midseason firing of Cavaliers' head coach David Blatt. Despite these distractions, Cleveland finished the year with 57 wins and {{the best record in the}} East. James' final averages were 25.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on 52 percent shooting. In the playoffs, the Cavaliers advanced comfortably to the Finals, losing only two games en route to a rematch with the Warriors, who were coming off a record-setting 73 win season. To begin the series, Cleveland fell behind 3–1, including two blowout losses. James responded by registering back-to-back 41 point games in Games 5 and 6, leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive wins to stave off elimination. In Game 7, he posted a triple-double and made a number of <b>key</b> <b>plays,</b> including a memorable chase-down block on Andre Iguodala in the final two minutes, as Cleveland emerged victorious, winning the city's first professional sports title in 52 years and becoming the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3–1 series deficit in the Finals. James became just the third player to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals Game 7, and behind series averages of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 2.6 steals per game, he also became the first player in league history to lead both teams in all five statistical categories for a playoff round, culminating in a unanimous Finals MVP selection.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} of the four games, Hill led all scorers with 21 points and helped the Spurs defeat the Utah Jazz, 82–57. He {{followed}} up with a quiet offensive performance, 6 points, in a win against the NBDL Ambassadors, before scoring 18 points in a loss versus the Gerald Green-led Mavericks. In the final game of the Revue, Hill once again struggled with his shooting (1–7) but managed to make <b>key</b> <b>plays</b> with the game on the line. Hill made two clutch free throws with 6.9 seconds left and then forced a turnover on the defensive end to beat the previously undefeated Atlanta Hawks.|$|E
25|$|Two <b>key</b> <b>plays</b> {{allowed the}} Bengals {{to start their}} first two drives in Buffalo territory, and they took {{advantage}} of their field position with touchdowns on each one. First, defensive back Mike Fuller returned a punt 27 yards to the Bills 42-yard line. Six plays later (one a 14-yard catch by tight end Dan Ross), Charles Alexander scored on a 4-yard touchdown run. On Buffalo's ensuing drive, defensive back Ken Riley intercepted a pass from Ferguson on the Bills 48-yard line. Cincinnati then drove 48 yards in eight plays, including Isaac Curtis' 22-yard reception on second and 17, to score with fullback Pete Johnson's 1-yard run, giving them a 14–0 lead before Buffalo had gained a single first down or completed a pass.|$|E
25|$|However, Pittsburgh {{ended up}} {{dominating}} the second quarter. After punting on their next drive, Steelers defensive back Lethon Flowers recovered a fumble from George (his first fumble of the season) on the Titans 8-yard line, leading to Maddox's 8-yard {{touchdown pass to}} Hines Ward. Then Tennessee lost another turnover when McNair threw a pass that was intercepted by Chad Scott on the Steelers 41. On the next play, Maddox completed a 40-yard pass to Plaxico Burress, setting up Jeff Reed's 30-yard field goal that made the score 14-10. The next time they had the ball, they took advantage of a 35-yard pass interference penalty against Rolle, along with three <b>key</b> <b>plays</b> by Ward, who caught two passes for 18 yards and rushed for 11. Reed finished the drive with a 39-yard field goal on the last play of the half, making the score 14-13 going into halftime.|$|E

500|$|Tech closed {{what was}} then the {{greatest}} season in its history with a 7–0 defeat of the Auburn Plainsmen. To begin the second quarter, Strupper had two <b>key</b> <b>plays,</b> the last of which was the game-deciding touchdown.

Later, with seconds remaining in regulation and with Kansas trailing by three, he took the ball down the court following a Memphis free throw, barely escaping fouls, and passed the ball to teammate Mario Chalmers, who made a three-pointer to tie the game with two seconds remaining. Kansas would go on to win in overtime. [...] He missed six games due to a stress fracture of his foot. [...] Following the season, he had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee.|$|E
500|$|Michigan {{concluded}} {{the regular season}} with a 20–14 win in its annual rivalry game against Ohio State, securing the Wolverines' first perfect regular season since 1971. The game, which drew a record crowd of 106,982 to Michigan Stadium, began with a strong showing by both defensive units. The first ten possessions ended with nine punts and a fumble by Ohio State quarterback, Stanley Jackson. [...] Michigan took a 7–0 lead {{in the second quarter}} with a two-minute, 62-yard touchdown drive. [...] The <b>key</b> <b>plays</b> on the drive were a 37-yard pass from Brian Griese to Charles Woodson and a 15-yard run by Chris Floyd taking the ball to the one-yard-line. Anthony Thomas slipped past middle linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer for the touchdown. Michigan's defense held Ohio State to three plays on the following drive, and Woodson returned Ohio State's punt 78 yards up the left sideline for Michigan's second touchdown with 3:43 remaining in the first half. Katzenmoyer blocked Kraig Baker's extra point attempt and ran the ball back to Michigan's 30-yard-line. [...] Michigan led 13–0 at halftime.|$|E
500|$|Covering or {{uncovering}} the tone holes varies {{the length of}} the pipe, changing the resonant frequencies of the enclosed air column and hence the pitch. A clarinetist moves between the chalumeau and clarion registers through use of the register key; clarinetists call the change from chalumeau register to clarion register [...] "the break". The open register key stops the fundamental frequency from being reinforced, and the reed is forced to vibrate at three times the speed it was originally. This produces a note a twelfth above the original note. Most instruments overblow at two times the speed of the fundamental frequency (the octave), but as the clarinet acts as a closed pipe system, the reed cannot vibrate at twice its original speed because it would be creating a 'puff' of air at the time the previous 'puff' is returning as a rarefaction. This means it cannot be reinforced and so would die away. The chalumeau register plays fundamentals, whereas the clarion register, aided by the register <b>key,</b> <b>plays</b> third harmonics (a perfect twelfth higher than the fundamentals). The first several notes of the altissimo range, aided by the register key and venting with the first left-hand hole, play fifth harmonics (a major seventeenth, a perfect twelfth plus a major sixth, above the fundamentals). The clarinet is therefore said to overblow at the twelfth and, when moving to the altissimo register, seventeenth. By contrast, nearly all other woodwind instruments overblow at the octave or (like the ocarina and tonette) do not overblow at all. A clarinet must have holes and keys for nineteen notes, a chromatic octave and a half from bottom E to B, in its lowest register to play the chromatic scale. This overblowing behavior explains the clarinet's great range and complex fingering system. The fifth and seventh harmonics are also available, sounding a further sixth and fourth (a flat, diminished fifth) higher respectively; these are the notes of the altissimo register. This is also why the inner [...] "waist" [...] measurement is so critical to these harmonic frequencies.|$|E
