25|$|Set in the 1830s, {{the story}} centers on Rosina da Silva, the {{sophisticated}} eldest {{daughter of a}} wealthy Jewish Italian family living in a small enclave of Sephardic London Jews. When her father is murdered {{on the street and}} leaves behind numerous debts, she refuses an arranged marriage to an older suitor, declaring that she will work to support her family, even if she has to take to the stage like her aunt, who is a renowned singer. She decides to use her classical education and advertise her services as a governess, transforming herself into Mary Blackchurch - a Protestant of partial Italian descent - in order to conceal her heritage. She quickly accepts a position as governess for a Scottish family living on the Isle of Skye in the Hebrides. Patriarch Charles Cavendish <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> science intent on solving the problem of retaining a photographic image on paper, while his pretentious wife flounders in a sea of ennui. Their young daughter Clementina initially resists Mary's discipline, but eventually finds in her a friend and companion.|$|E
25|$|Harry is Edna’s {{husband and}} Tobias’s best friend. At {{one point in}} the past, Harry and Tobias, coincidentally, had an extramarital affair with the same young woman. Besides both having been {{businessmen}} and meeting at the same club, it is unclear what else Harry and Tobias have in common except that they have known one another {{for a long time and}} neither sleeps with his wife. Harry is something of a reflection of Tobias, but he is even more reserved. Of all the characters in this play, Harry speaks the least. And when he does speak, he <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> few words with lots of pauses around each one. He prefers to talk around things rather than going at them straight on. He also avoids questions, as when Agnes tries to find out why he and his wife have come to their home. Instead of giving Agnes an answer, he compliments the furnishings in Agnes’s home. He also has the tendency to repeat himself; at one point he repeats the same line four times when he tries to explain how fear has driven his wife and him out of their home. It is Harry, in the end, who tells Tobias that he and Edna have decided to leave. Although Harry prompted the discussion with Edna about resolving the issue of staying at their friends’ house, it is implied that Edna made the decision and that Harry just delivered the message.|$|E
500|$|Robert Dougherty {{writes that}} the episode {{possesses}} similar themes to [...] "Tabula Rasa" [...] – [...] "Walkabout" [...] is about [...] "being able to overcome the past and start over." [...] It presents the dichotomy seen {{in much of the}} series; while Jack <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> science, Locke <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> faith. Lindelof discussed that since Locke's healing was interpreted by the character as a religious experience, [...] "this character had been presented as this very sort of mystical figure moving forward".|$|E

"There is no {{question}} of his guilt....He {{was by no means}} as rabid and outspoken in his expressions as many others, and but for his prominence and the resulting far-reaching effect of his words, very probably might not have received the sentence he did.

He <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> much personal charm and impressive personality, which qualifications make him a dangerous man calculated to mislead the unthinking and affording excuse for those with criminal intent." ...|$|E
500|$|John Quincy Adams {{concluded}} in 1821 that [...] "Calhoun <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> fair and candid mind, of honorable principles, of clear and quick understanding, of cool self-possession, of enlarged philosophical views, and of ardent patriotism. He is above all sectional and factious prejudices {{more than any}} other statesman of this Union with whom I have ever acted." [...] Historian Charles Wiltse noted Calhoun's evolution, [...] "Though he is known today primarily for his sectionalism, Calhoun was the last of the great political leaders of his time to take a sectional position—later than Daniel Webster, later than Henry Clay, later than Adams himself." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the words}} of John Philipps Kenyon, [...] "Charles Stuart <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> contradictions and controversy". Revered by high Tories who {{considered}} him a saintly martyr, he was condemned by Whig historians, such as Samuel Rawson Gardiner, who thought him duplicitous and delusional. In recent decades, most historians have criticised him, the main exception being Kevin Sharpe who offered a more sympathetic view of Charles {{that has not been}} widely adopted. While Sharpe argued that the king was a dynamic man of conscience, Professor Barry Coward thought Charles [...] "was the most incompetent monarch of England since Henry VI", a view shared by Ronald Hutton, who called him [...] "the worst king we have had since the Middle Ages".|$|E
500|$|Macdonald (1815–91) was {{the first}} Prime Minister of Canada, in office 1867–73, and again 1878–91. [...] Brown depicts the Prime Minister {{in the role of}} scheming villain and caricatures his {{features}} in an absurd manner, giving him an extremely oversized nose and showing him as a drunk. [...] He <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> ambitions and will not let anyone {{stand in the way of}} his legacy. [...] In the appendix, however, Brown discloses that he does not see Macdonald as the villain he has portrayed in the book. [...] Brown's distrust of big government leads him to push the conspiracy theory side of the story to Macdonald's detriment, but, in the end, he states that he [...] "would rather have lived in a state run by John A. Macdonald than one run by Louis Riel".|$|E
500|$|He bemoaned the Conservatives {{when they}} were in Opposition, criticising Michael Howard in particular: [...] "I knew Michael Howard {{was going to be a}} {{disaster}} as soon as he opposed top-up fees, either out of sentimentality or calculated expediency so that it might get him a bit of the student vote...Instead of backing Tony Blair, causing revolution in the Labour Party, the Conservatives have been whoring after strange gods, coming up with increasingly strange policies." [...] He likened Gordon Brown to the fictional Kenneth Widmerpool, continuing, [...] "It seems to me that with Brown there is a complete sense of humour and charm bypass." [...] Of Ed Miliband, in 2015 he said [...] "He <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> high ambition and low talent – the worst possible combination.

500|$|More positively, Nelson Bocaranda, a Venezuelan TV commentator, {{considers}} the novel to be a tonic for Latin American culture: [...] "people here saw a Bolívar who <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> flesh and bones just like themselves". Mexican author Carlos Fuentes agrees with Bocaranda saying: [...] "What comes across beautifully and poignantly {{in this book}} is a man dealing with the unknown world of democratic ideas". García Márquez realistically portrays a ridiculous figure trapped in a labyrinth, magnifying the General's defects, and presenting an image of Bolívar contrary to that instilled in classrooms. However, the novel also depicts Bolívar as an idealist and political theorist who predicted many problems that would obstruct Latin American advancement in the future. García Márquez depicts a figure who {{was aware of the}} racial and social friction in Latin American society, feared debt, and warned against economic irresponsibility. He has the General warn his aide-de-camp, Agustín de Iturbide, against the future interference of the United States {{in the internal affairs of}} Latin America.|$|E
500|$|Rotheram {{commanded}} Lapwing for {{the next}} two years, operating with the Channel Fleet and capturing several small French prizes. In 1802 Rotheram returned to reserve ashore during the Peace of Amiens. This retirement lasted until 1804, when Rotheram was recalled up to service as flag captain of HMS Dreadnought, a second rate ship of the line that flew the flag of Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood. Collingwood and Rotheram had a poor relationship, Collingwood commenting by letter to his brother that [...] "He [...] <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> no talent as a sea officer, and of little assistance to me." [...] Nevertheless, when Collingwood moved to HMS Royal Sovereign in October 1805 as second-in-command of the fleet under Lord Nelson blockading the Franco-Spanish fleet in Cadiz, he brought Rotheram with him. Nelson was aware of the personal conflict between the men, and invited both Collingwood and Rotheram to dinner in a partially successful effort to reconcile them.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between Chamberlain and Lloyd George was thenceforth one of hatred, with Chamberlain calling Lloyd George [...] "that dirty little Welsh Attorney" [...] and being implacably opposed to Lloyd George joining the National Government in the 1930s. Austen Chamberlain, {{the brother of}} one opponent and, for a time, the political ally of the other, regretted the enmity, [...] "More's the pity, for together if they were together they might do a great deal." [...] Lloyd George would later paint a most unflattering portrait of Chamberlain in his 1935 War Memoirs, claiming that “Mr Chamberlain <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> rigid competency. Such men have their uses in conventional times … and are indispensable for filling subordinate posts at all times. But they are lost in an emergency or in creative tasks at any time.” HIs dislike of Chamberlain is sometimes {{said to have been}} based on phrenology, although little contemporary evidence has been found to confirm this. Lloyd George would also have the last laugh in May 1940, when his speech in the Norway Debate helped bring down Chamberlain’s government.|$|E
