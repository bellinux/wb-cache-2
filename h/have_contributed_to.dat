5|$|Ahimsa's precept of 'cause no injury' {{includes}} one's deeds, words, and thoughts. Classical {{literature of}} Hinduism such as Mahabharata and Ramayana, {{as well as}} modern scholars debate principles of Ahimsa when one is faced with war and situations requiring self-defence.

5|$|Over time, the {{traditional}} structure {{has had to}} adapt to very influential changes, including divorce {{and the introduction of}} single-parent families, teenage pregnancy and unwed mothers, and same-sex marriage, and increased interest in adoption. Social movements such as the feminist movement and the stay-at-home father <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the creation of alternative family forms, generating new versions of the American family.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{say that}} asexual {{reproduction}} {{in the wild}} is rare, and probably a last-ditch effort to reproduce when a mate is not present. Asexual reproduction diminishes genetic diversity, which helps build defenses against threats to the species. Species that rely solely on it risk extinction. Asexual reproduction may <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the blue shark's decline off the Irish coast.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} inferences {{that can be}} made from the A-not-B error has been challenged.

5|$|The {{refinery}} {{was large}} and old, featuring outdated construction methods, and these factors are believed to <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the fire's severity.

5|$|When Poland {{entered the}} Western camp in April 1939, General Gamelin {{reminded}} General Kasprzycki of the Polish {{role in the}} dismemberment of Czechoslovakia.

5|$|Women's {{literature}} in Britain {{has had a}} long and often troubled history, with many female writers producing work under a pen name, such as George Eliot.

5|$|A further {{complication}} is that {{a certain}} proportion of the Allied manpower was needed to man the fleet, which amounted to at least 110 triremes, and thus approximately 22,000 men. Since the Battle of Mycale was fought at least near-simultaneously with the Battle of Plataea, then this was a pool of manpower which could not <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> Plataea, and further reduces the likelihood that 110,000 Greeks assembled before Plataea.|$|E
5|$|A {{pattern of}} lake cycles {{becoming}} {{longer than the}} preceding one has been noted. Water from the lake may <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> increased oxygen-18 at Sajama around 14,300 years ago, possibly triggered by evaporation. As the lake level dropped, Lake Poopó would have been disconnected first; the sill separating it {{from the rest of}} Lake Tauca is relatively shallow. Coipasa and Uyuni would have remained connected until later. Water levels in Lake Titicaca's Lake Huinaimarca were low by 14,200 BP.|$|E
5|$|After its {{discovery}} in 1897, {{it has never}} been recorded again and it is now considered extinct; the presence of introduced black rats on María Madre may <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> its extinction. Oryzomys nelsoni was a large species, distinguished in particular by its long tail, robust skull, and large incisors. It was reddish to yellowish above and mostly white below.
