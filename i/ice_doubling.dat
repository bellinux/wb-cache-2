40|$|On Mars, a smooth, draping unit—the “latitude-dependant mantle” (LDM), {{believed}} to comprise meter thick layers {{of dust and}} ice—extends from the midlatitudes to the poles, covering at least 23 % of the surface. We show that the LDM can be 30 [*]m deep on pole-facing crater walls, and by measuring the erosional and depositional volumes of small gullies that incise these LDM deposits, we show that it must contain between 46 % and 95 % ice by volume. Extrapolating to a global scale, these deposits account for ~ 10 4 [*]km 3 of near-surface <b>ice,</b> <b>doubling</b> previous LDM volume estimates. Thick LDM deposits can be emplaced during the many orbital variation-driven climate excursions {{that occurred during the}} Amazonian period. We suggest that LDM deposits are similar to ice sheets composed of massive ice with a surface lag...|$|E
40|$|A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} in Santala Bay with weekly samplings during February and March 2000. Ice thickness was 20 - 28 cm, snow cover 0 - 1 cm. The under-ice water column was stratified with a cold (- 0. 3 - 0. 2 °C) and less saline (S = 2. 1 - 4. 9) interface layer. Concentrations of particulate organic carbon (0. 5 - 5. 8 mg POC/l) and algal pigments (0. 3 - 18. 2 µg chlorophyll a/l) were higher in the ice than in the water (0. 2 - 0. 5 mg POC/l, 1. 6 - 7. 1 µg chlorophyll a/l) and peaked mostly in the bottom part of the ice. The thin ice and almost lacking snow cover had favoured an early ice-algal and phytoplankton bloom. The diversity of metazoans was low, with six species in the ice and eight species in the under-ice water. The rotifer Synchaeta cf. littoralis dominated both in ice and water, with maximum abundances of 230 individuals/l in the bottom part of the ice. Rotifer eggs were also observed in the ice. Baltic sea ice seems to be a suitable habitat for rotifers. Nauplii and copepodids of the calanoid Acartia longiremis in the under-ice water showed some herbivorous feeding (< 0. 1 - 0. 23 ng gut pigment/individual), but analysis of fatty acids, fatty alcohols and biomarker ratios indicated a more omnivorous/carnivorous diet. Despite low temperatures, this copepod showed growth and development below the <b>ice,</b> <b>doubling</b> in numbers (mainly CI, CII) from 118 to 230 individuals m during the third week of March...|$|E

50|$|In 1896, the Knickerbocker Ice Company {{and other}} major ice {{companies}} consolidated into a natural trust that led to speculation that {{it was trying to}} fix the prices of its products. When this occurred, the price of <b>ice</b> <b>doubled,</b> setting off a wave of unrest and demonstrations by the public who felt they were being taken advantage of. At the center of this scandal was New York Mayor Robert Anderson Van Wyck and numerous city officials. Van Wyck was accused of conspiring to create an ice monopoly and it is believed the mayor and his brother were given $1.7 million in the trust’s stock. In 1900, Van Wyck and the suspected city officials appeared before Justice William Jay Gaynor and told the court that Charles W. Morse, President of the American Ice Company, advised him to purchase these stocks, which he said, he never did.

50|$|A climber chooses {{equipment}} {{according to}} the slope and texture of the ice. For example, on flat ice, almost any good hiking or mountaineering boot will usually suffice, but for serious <b>ice</b> climbing <b>double</b> plastic mountaineering boots or their stiff leather equivalent are usually used, which must be crampon compatible and stiff enough to support the climber and maintain ankle support. On short, low angled slopes, one can use an ice axe to chop steps. For longer and steeper slopes or glacier travel, crampons are mandatory for a safe climb. Vertical ice climbing is done with crampons and ice axes (those specific to vertical ice generally being called technical ice axes, or ice tools); climbers kick their legs to engage the front points of the crampons in the ice, and then swing the axe into the ice above their heads. This technique is known as front pointing. The strength of the ice is often surprising; even if the axe goes in only a centimeter or so {{it is enough to}} pull up on. If a climber is leading, they will need to place ice screws as protection on the way up (see climbing system). Most mountaineers would only consider the last scenario true ice climbing; the less steep variations are routine aspects of winter mountaineering.|$|R
40|$|The Advanced Land Observation System (ALOS) Phased-Array Synthetic-Aperture Radar (PALSAR) is an L-band {{frequency}} (1. 27 GHz) radar {{capable of}} continental-scale interferometric observations of ice sheet motion. Here, {{we show that}} PALSAR data yield excellent measurements of ice motion compared to C-band (5. 6 GHz) radar data because of greater temporal coherence over snow and firn. We compare PALSAR velocities from year 2006 in Pine Island Bay, West Antarctica with those spanning years 1974 to 2007. Between 1996 and 2007, Pine Island Glacier sped up 42 % and ungrounded over most of its ice plain. Smith Glacier accelerated 83 % and ungrounded as well. Their largest speed up are recorded in 2007. Thwaites Glacier is not accelerating but widening with time and its eastern <b>ice</b> shelf <b>doubled</b> its speed. Total ice discharge from these glaciers increased 30 % in 12 yr and the net mass loss increased 170 % from 39 ± 15 Gt/yr to 105 ± 27 Gt /yr. Longer-term velocity changes suggest only a moderate loss in the 1970 s. As the glaciers unground into the deeper, smoother beds inland, the mass loss from this region will grow considerably larger in years to come. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union...|$|R
