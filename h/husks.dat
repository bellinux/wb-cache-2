5|$|Burnham {{was born}} on May 11, 1861 on a Dakota Sioux Indian {{reservation}} in Minnesota, to a missionary family living near the small pioneer town of Tivoli (now gone), about 20 miles (32km) from Mankato. His father, the Reverend Edwin Otway Burnham, was a Presbyterian minister educated and ordained in New York; {{he was born in}} Ghent, Kentucky. His mother Rebecca Russell Burnham had spent most of her childhood in Iowa, having emigrated with her family from Westminster, England at the age of three. In the Dakota War of 1862, Chief Little Crow and his Sioux warriors attacked the nearby town New Ulm, Minnesota; Burnham's father was in Mankato buying ammunition at the time, so when Burnham's mother saw Sioux approaching her cabin dressed in war paint, she knew she had to leave and could never escape carrying her baby. She hid Frederick in a basket of green corn <b>husks</b> in a corn field and fled for her life. Once the Sioux attack had been repulsed, she returned to find their house burned down, but the baby Frederick was safe, fast asleep in the basket with the corn <b>husks.</b>|$|E

40|$|Capítulos en librosOlive <b>husk</b> is a {{by-product}} obtained from the industrial process for olive oil production containing oil, olive skin and stones. This olive <b>husk</b> is usually carried from presses to an Olive Waste Management Center where a mechanical milling extraction process is performed to obtain Olive Pomace Oil. The remaining oil in the <b>husk</b> is chemically extracted and finally, the residual <b>husk</b> is used as fuel for a cogeneration process to produce electricity. The olive Pomace Oil from mechanical milling has higher quality and price than the one extracted chemically. As the seasonal olive collection campaign is from October to March, <b>husk</b> usually is stored and processed along the year. Due to the own <b>husk</b> chemical degradation and the constrained milling capacity, not all received <b>husk</b> is milled mechanically but always chemically. Different pools are used to store and classify <b>husk</b> qualities. There are pools for short, medium and long term horizons. Short term pools have low storage capacity and contains high quality <b>husk</b> which is shortly milled mechanically. Medium term pools have higher storage capacity containing medium quality <b>husk.</b> These mid term pools provide <b>husk</b> to be milled mechanically when the collection rate decreases, or the <b>husk</b> quality coming from presses is poor. Long term pools have also high storage capacity and store <b>husk</b> with poor quality to be processed only chemically. The stochastic model is focused on optimal pouring decisions into different types of pools to improve {{the efficiency of the}} <b>husk</b> mechanical milling. Several probabilistic scenarios of weekly <b>husk</b> pouring from presses are included in the stochastic programming model. Blending <b>husk</b> with different qualities brings nonlinear constraints into the computation of milling efficiency. To cope with these nonlinearities, an accurate approximation has been developed.
