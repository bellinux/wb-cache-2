40|$|Crystallisation from a melt or {{solution}} has {{the potential}} to yield a product with a very high purity in a single equilibrium step. Pure crystals have to be separated from the impure mother liquor, which is usually done by standard solid-liquid separation techniques like filtration or centrifugation. For high purity products, additional washing is required to remove residual mother liquor from the crystal cake. An attractive alternative, however, is to use a wash column, which combines continuous solid-liquid separation with efficient counter-current washing using very little or no wash liquid. The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>wash</b> column (HWC) developed by TNO combines a high washing efficiency with a high specific production capacity...|$|E

40|$|A fouling index (FI) was {{introduced}} as {{a novel approach}} to investigate natural organic matter (NOM) fouling behavior in a low pressure membrane ultrafiltration process. Humic acid (HA), bovine serum albumin (BSA) and sodium alginate (SA), {{were used in the}} experiments. According to FI values, fouling was caused by NOM in two steps: a fast fouling process followed by a slow one. FI of the fast stage (FIF) was much greater than that of the slow one (FIS), showing the initial interaction would {{play a significant role in}} the fouling process over a short time. The results of mass balance suggested that a small fraction of DOC was responsible for membrane fouling caused by adsorption. Furthermore, both hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic interaction between NOM and the membrane determined the fouling behavior. Only a portion of foulants was removed after <b>hydraulic</b> <b>washing.</b> The sequence of NOM causing irreversible fouling was BSA > HA > SA, and the sequence of irreversible fouling after alkaline cleaning was SA > BSA > HA. The variations of FI values were consistent with the results of mass balances and flux recovery, which confirmed the FI was a simple and effective tool to describe the membrane fouling process...|$|R

Hydraulic mining methods and the resulting spoil banks obliterated all the remains of the original Diamond City, {{as well as the other}} small communities in the gulches. Hydraulic mining was very damaging to the environment on the gulch. It changed the appearance, geography and ecosystem of Confederate Gulch.|$|R

40|$|Title {{from first}} page of PDF file (viewed November 30, 2010) Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 45 - 48) Double-ring infiltrometer tests were done at eight sites in alluvial deposits near Joshua Tree, California to measure surface infiltration rates and aid in evaluating the study area for construction of infiltration ponds for groundwater recharge. Surface infiltration rates ranged from 3. 61 x 10 ????? ft??/s within the wash north of Pinto Mountain Fault, to 6. 68 x 10 ?????? ft??/s south of the fault outside of an active <b>wash.</b> <b>Hydraulic</b> conductivity of alluvium was estimated from infiltration data using the computer program VS 2 D. Hydraulic conductivities estimated using VS 2 D ranged from 1. 74 x 10 ?????? ft/s to 4. 63 x 10 ?????? ft/s and were {{within the range of}} fine sand to silty sand. Hydraulic conductivities also were measured by laboratory analysis of surface cores from each site and ranged from 7. 59 x 10 ?????? ft/s to 4. 33 x 10 ?????? ft/s. Hydraulic conductivities computed from particle size data using the pedotransfer function (PTF) based computer program Rosetta ranged from 6. 71 x 10 ?????? ft/s to 1. 73 x 10 ?????? ft/s. Laboratory hydraulic conductivities matched the field data better than hydraulic conductivities calculated using Rosetta, but neither method correctly predicted infiltration rates measured using the double-ring infiltrometer. Evidence for a surficial low-permeability layer was seen in the data for six of the eight test sites, suggesting the formation of runoff depositional crusts and sieving crusts during intermittent wash flow. Surficial crusts can be removed before pond infiltration, but will distort infiltration measurements and should be accounted for. Simulation results using VS 2 D were sensitive to low-permeability layers at shallow depths, 0 to 4 feet below land surface, within the alluvium. Results were not sensitive to the thickness of the layer. The length of the infiltrometer test should be long enough to ensure detection of any subsurface layering. VS 2 D was used to simulate infiltration from one-acre spreading ponds {{on either side of the}} Pinto Mountain Fault to provide an estimated range of recharge times for the study area. The time required before the wetting front reaches the water table 400 feet below land surface was 14 - 60 days, implying that the area may be suitable for recharge through surface infiltration. Model simulations do not account for low-permeability layers within the alluvium or decreases in hydraulic conductivity with depth caused by compaction, consolidation, or changes in subsurface geology. As a consequence actual infiltration rates will probably be less than simulated rates. A more extensive survey of the subsurface geology and hydraulic properties of the study area including test drilling would help to asses subsurface conditions that would inhibit infiltration and recharge...|$|R
40|$|Efficient {{management}} of domestic wastewater {{is a primary}} requirement for human well being. Failure to adequately address issues of wastewater collection, treatment and disposal can lead to adverse public health and environmental impacts. The increasing spread of urbanisation {{has led to the}} conversion of previously rural land into urban developments and the more intensive development of semi urban areas. However the provision of reticulated sewerage facilities has not kept pace with this expansion in urbanisation. This has resulted in a growing dependency on onsite sewage treatment. Though considered only as a temporary measure in the past, these systems are now considered as the most cost effective option and have become a permanent feature in some urban areas. This report is {{the first of a series}} of reports to be produced and is the outcome of a research project initiated by the Brisbane City Council. The primary objective of the research undertaken was to relate the treatment performance of onsite sewage treatment systems with soil conditions at site, with the emphasis being on septic tanks. This report consists of a ‘state of the art’ review of research undertaken in the arena of onsite sewage treatment. The evaluation of research brings together significant work undertaken locally and overseas. It focuses mainly on septic tanks in keeping with the primary objectives of the project. This report has acted as the springboard for the later field investigations and analysis undertaken as part of the project. Septic tanks still continue to be used widely due to their simplicity and low cost. Generally the treatment performance of septic tanks can be highly variable due to numerous factors, but a properly designed, operated and maintained septic tank can produce effluent of satisfactory quality. The reduction of <b>hydraulic</b> surges from <b>washing</b> machines and dishwashers, regular removal of accumulated septage and the elimination of harmful chemicals are some of the practices that can improve system performance considerably. The relative advantages of multi chamber over single chamber septic tanks is an issue that needs to be resolved in view of the conflicting research outcomes. In recent years, aerobic wastewater treatment systems (AWTS) have been gaining in popularity. This can be mainly attributed to the desire to avoid subsurface effluent disposal, which is the main cause of septic tank failure. The use of aerobic processes for treatment of wastewater and the disinfection of effluent prior to disposal is capable of producing effluent of a quality suitable for surface disposal. However the field performance of these has been disappointing. A significant number of these systems do not perform to stipulated standards and quality can be highly variable. This is primarily due to houseowner neglect or ignorance of correct operational and maintenance procedures. The other problems include greater susceptibility to shock loadings and sludge bulking. As identified in literature a number of design features can also contribute to this wide variation in quality. The other treatment processes in common use are the various types of filter systems. These include intermittent and recirculating sand filters. These systems too have their inherent advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore as in the case of aerobic systems, their performance is very much dependent on individual houseowner operation and maintenance practices. In recent years the use of biofilters has attracted research interest and particularly the use of peat. High removal rates of various wastewater pollutants have been reported in research literature. Despite these satisfactory results, leachate from peat has been reported in various studies. This is an issue that needs further investigations and as such biofilters can still be considered to be in the experimental stage. The use of other filter media such as absorbent plastic and bark has also been reported in literature. The safe and hygienic disposal of treated effluent is a matter of concern in the case of onsite sewage treatment. Subsurface disposal is the most common and the only option in the case of septic tank treatment. Soil is an excellent treatment medium if suitable conditions are present. The processes of sorption, filtration and oxidation can remove the various wastewater pollutants. The subsurface characteristics of the disposal area are among the most important parameters governing process performance. Therefore it is important that the soil and topographic conditions are taken into consideration in the design of the soil absorption system. Seepage trenches and beds are the common systems in use. Seepage pits or chambers can be used where subsurface conditions warrant, whilst above grade mounds have been recommended for a variety of difficult site conditions. All these systems have their inherent advantages and disadvantages and the preferable soil absorption system should be selected based on site characteristics. The use of gravel as in-fill for beds and trenches is open to question. It does not contribute to effluent treatment and has been shown to reduce the effective infiltrative surface area. This is due to physical obstruction and the migration of fines entrained in the gravel, into the soil matrix. The surface application of effluent is coming into increasing use with the advent of aerobic treatment systems. This has the advantage that treatment is undertaken on the upper soil horizons, which is chemically and biologically the most effective in effluent renovation. Numerous research studies have demonstrated the feasibility of this practice. However the overriding criteria is the quality of the effluent. It has to be of exceptionally good quality in order to ensure that there are no resulting public health impacts due to aerosol drift. This essentially is the main issue of concern, due to the unreliability of the effluent quality from aerobic systems. Secondly, it has also been found that most householders do not take adequate care in the operation of spray irrigation systems or in the maintenance of the irrigation area. Under these circumstances surface disposal of effluent should be approached with caution and would require appropriate householder education and stringent compliance requirements. However despite all this, the efficiency with which the process is undertaken will ultimately rest with the individual householder and this is where most concern rests. Greywater too should require similar considerations. Surface irrigation of greywater is currently being permitted in a number of local authority jurisdictions in Queensland. Considering the fact that greywater constitutes the largest fraction of the total wastewater generated in a household, it could be considered to be a potential resource. Unfortunately in most circumstances the only pretreatment that is required to be undertaken prior to reuse is the removal of oil and grease. This is an issue of concern as greywater can considered to be a weak to medium sewage as it contains primary pollutants such as BOD material and nutrients and may also include microbial contamination. Therefore its use for surface irrigation can pose a potential health risk. This is further compounded by the fact that most householders are unaware of the potential adverse impacts of indiscriminate greywater reuse. As in the case of blackwater effluent reuse, there have been suggestions that greywater should also be subjected to stringent guidelines. Under these circumstances the surface application of any wastewater requires careful consideration. The other option available for the disposal effluent is the use of evaporation systems. The use of evapotranspiration systems has been covered in this report. Research has shown that these systems are susceptible to a number of factors and in particular to climatic conditions. As such their applicability is location specific. Also the design of systems based solely on evapotranspiration is questionable. In order to ensure more reliability, the systems should be designed to include soil absorption. The successful use of these systems for intermittent usage has been noted in literature. Taking into consideration the issues discussed above, subsurface disposal of effluent is the safest under most conditions. This is provided the facility has been designed to accommodate site conditions. The main problem associated with subsurface disposal is the formation of a clogging mat on the infiltrative surfaces. Due to the formation of the clogging mat, the capacity of the soil to handle effluent is no longer governed by the soil’s hydraulic conductivity as measured by the percolation test, but rather by the infiltration rate through the clogged zone. The characteristics of the clogging mat have been shown to be influenced by various soil and effluent characteristics. Secondly, the mechanisms of clogging mat formation have been found to be influenced by various physical, chemical and biological processes. Biological clogging is the most common process taking place and occurs due to bacterial growth or its by-products reducing the soil pore diameters. Biological clogging is generally associated with anaerobic conditions. The formation of the clogging mat provides significant benefits. It acts as an efficient filter for the removal of microorganisms. Also as the clogging mat increases the hydraulic impedance to flow, unsaturated flow conditions will occur below the mat. This permits greater contact between effluent and soil particles thereby enhancing the purification process. This is particularly important in the case of highly permeable soils. However the adverse impacts of the clogging mat formation cannot be ignored as they can lead to significant reduction in the infiltration rate. This in fact is the most common cause of soil absorption systems failure. As the formation of the clogging mat is inevitable, it is important|$|R
