5|$|Jim Elliot {{first heard}} of the Huaorani in 1950 from a former missionary to Ecuador, and {{afterwards}} indicated that God <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> to Ecuador to evangelize the Huaorani. He began corresponding with his friend Pete Fleming about his desire to minister in Ecuador, and in 1952 the two men set sail for Guayaquil as missionaries with the Plymouth Brethren. For six months they lived in Quito {{with the goal of}} learning Spanish. They then moved to Shandia, a Quechua mission station deep in the Ecuadorian jungle. There they worked under the supervision of a Christian Missions in Many Lands missionary, Wilfred Tidmarsh, and began exposing themselves to the culture and studying the Quechua language.|$|E
25|$|A fearless umpire, he {{repeatedly}} called Geoff Griffin for throwing, {{in the exhibition}} match staged following the early conclusion of the Lord's Test between England and South Africa in 1960, after Frank Lee <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> during the Test itself. This {{had the effect of}} ending Griffin's Test career.|$|E
25|$|David Sutcliffe, 30, was a {{law student}} at the University of Colorado at Boulder who was interning at Pettit & Martin for the summer. Ironically, Sutcliffe had not even been chosen {{initially}} for the intern program. The firm <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> to turn him down; Sutcliffe was so excited and overjoyed, thinking he had been accepted, that the firm made space for him.|$|E

25|$|By {{temperament}} conciliatory, he {{was rarely}} involved in controversy. However, during a Test on England's 1989–90 {{tour of the}} West Indies he criticised the umpire Lloyd Barker, claiming that he had {{allowed himself to be}} pressurised by the West Indies captain, Viv Richards, into wrongly giving Rob Bailey out caught down the leg side. Barker threatened to sue, believing incorrectly that Martin-Jenkins <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> a cheat. The case was settled by the BBC without going to court.|$|E
25|$|Police interviewed Bishop's husband, James Anderson, {{after it}} was {{determined}} that she <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> to pick her up after the shooting; they did not charge him with a crime. In addition, a neighbor revealed, in later interviews, that he saw the couple leaving their home with duffle bags on Friday afternoon, (revealed to be martial arts bags) prior to the shooting. Anderson revealed that his wife had borrowed the gun used in the shooting, and that he had escorted her to an indoor shooting range in the weeks prior to the incident.|$|E
25|$|Mayer {{eventually}} retired, {{and the new}} detective {{assigned to}} the case told Nels Rasmussen that {{he was unable to}} follow up on Mayer's notes and did not think that any new leads would emerge. Nels was rebuffed again in 1993, when he offered to pay for DNA testing on the evidence from the murder, now that the technology was available; he was told that the police had to have a suspect in order to proceed with testing. Lazarus briefly reunited with Ruetten in 1989; Mayer's notes show that Ruetten <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> and asked whether he still considered her a suspect.|$|E

25|$|The Seljuq {{state had}} started to split into small emirates (beyliks) that {{increasingly}} distanced themselves from both Mongol and Seljuq control. In 1277, responding to a call from Anatolia, the Mamluk sultan, Baibars, raided Anatolia and defeated the Mongols, temporarily replacing them as the administrator of the Seljuq realm. But since the native forces who <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> to Anatolia did not manifest themselves {{for the defense of}} the land, he had to return to his home base in Egypt, and the Mongol administration was re-assumed, officially and severely. Also, the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia captured the Mediterranean coast from Selinos to Seleucia, as well as the cities of Marash and Behisni, from the Seljuq in the 1240s.|$|E
25|$|In {{his grand}} jury testimony, Rove testified {{he learned of}} Plame's CIA {{affiliation}} from journalists and not from government officials. Rove testified that Novak called him in July 2003 to discuss a story unrelated to Plame or Wilson. Eventually, according to Rove, Novak told him he planned to report in an upcoming column that Plame worked for the CIA. Rove told the grand jury {{that by the time}} Novak <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>him,</b> he had already learned of Plame from other reporters, but that he could not recall which reporters had told him. When Novak inquired about Wilson's wife working for the CIA, Rove indicated he had heard something like that, according to the source's recounting of the grand jury testimony for the Associated Press. Rove told the grand jury that three days later, he had a phone conversation with Time magazine reporter Matt Cooper and, in an effort to discredit some of Wilson's allegations, informally told Cooper that he believed Wilson's wife worked for the CIA, though he never used her name. Rove also testified to the grand jury that he had heard from Libby that Plame worked for the CIA. Rove testified that Libby told him that he heard the information from journalists.|$|E
500|$|After {{two months}} of {{hearings}} and deliberations, the Watkins Committee recommended that McCarthy be censured {{on two of the}} 46 counts: his contempt of the Subcommittee on Rules and Administration, which <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> to testify in 1951 and 1952, and his abuse of General Zwicker in 1954. The Zwicker count was dropped by the full Senate on the grounds that McCarthy's conduct was arguably [...] "induced" [...] by Zwicker's own behavior. In place of this count, a new one was drafted regarding McCarthy's statements about the Watkins Committee itself.|$|E

500|$|Douglas adopted Boddy's [...] "Tricky Dick" [...] {{nickname}} for Nixon, and {{also referred to}} him as [...] "pee wee". Her name-calling {{had an effect on}} Nixon: when told she <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> [...] "a young man with a dark shirt" [...] in an allusion to Nazism, he inquired, [...] "Did she say that? Why, I'll castrate her." [...] Campaign official Bill Arnold joked that {{it would be difficult to}} do, and Nixon replied that he would do it anyway. Nixon returned the attacks; at friendly gatherings and especially at all-male events, he stated that Douglas was [...] "pink right down to her underwear".|$|E
500|$|Mulder later tells Scully that he {{does not}} believe Modell is on another killing spree, and, after an odd {{interview}} with Linda, believes she is the killer and has the same powers as Modell. Skinner suspends Mulder, but Mulder vows to prove his theory right. He talks with Modell's therapist again, who mentions that a nun from the Little Sisters of Charity <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> a [...] "conquered warrior". On a hunch, Mulder tries to show her a picture of Linda. The phone rings and, after stating she is with Mulder, she sticks her hand into a fuse box and is fatally electrocuted.|$|E
500|$|During this time, Benedict Arnold {{brought his}} sister Hannah to New Haven and {{established}} {{her in his}} apothecary to manage the business in his absence. He traveled extensively {{in the course of}} his business throughout New England and from Quebec to the West Indies, often in command of one of his own ships. On one of his voyages, Arnold fought a duel in Honduras with a British sea captain who <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> a [...] "damned Yankee, destitute of good manners or those of a gentleman". The captain was wounded after the first exchange of gunfire, and apologized after Arnold threatened to aim to kill on the second.|$|E

500|$|Gabriel Roman is an {{antagonist}} of Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, {{though he}} is built {{up to be the}} main villain until the game's climax. He is voiced by Simon Templeman. Roman first arrives while Drake and Sullivan are exploring the wreckage of a Kriegsmarine U-boat beached in the Amazon Rainforest. Roman, leader of a group of pirates and mercenaries, has loaned Sullivan a large sum of money in the past. Sullivan <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>him,</b> assuring him that he would soon find [...] "something big", and then have the money to pay Roman back. Roman, however, decides to steal the information that Drake and Sullivan have gathered and find the treasure for himself. To force Drake into compliance, Roman holds Sullivan hostage, and eventually shoots him, nearly fatally. Roman discovers the directions to El Dorado, but fails to capture Fisher and Drake.|$|E
500|$|The series {{introduced}} a new incarnation of the Doctor, the Eleventh, played by Matt Smith. This followed the departure of David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor, who left the role to help ease the transition from Davies to Moffat's showrunning. Smith's agent <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> and suggested that he try out for the role. Moffat was looking to cast a middle-aged actor, who was [...] "young enough to run but old enough to look wise". However, Smith, who was only 26 when cast, was the third person to audition and the production team knew [...] " [...] had their man". The producers were cautious about casting Smith because they felt that a 26-year-old actor could not play the Doctor adequately; BBC Head of Drama and executive producer Piers Wenger shared the sentiment, but noted that Smith was capable enough to play the role. Moffat also stated that Smith {{did not appear to}} be youthful at all. [...] Smith's casting in the role was revealed during an episode of Doctor Whos companion show Doctor Who Confidential, during which he described the role as [...] "a wonderful privilege and challenge that I hope I will thrive on".|$|E
500|$|At 4:00pm Lucan {{called at}} a chemist's on Lower Belgrave Street, close to Veronica's home, {{and asked the}} {{pharmacist}} there to identify a small capsule. It {{turned out to be}} Limbitrol5, a drug for the treatment of anxiety and depression. Lucan had apparently made several similar visits since he separated from his wife; he never told the pharmacist where he got the drugs. At 4:45pm he called a friend, literary agent Michael Hicks-Beach, and between 6:30pm and 7:00pm met with him at his flat on Elizabeth Street. Lucan wanted his help with an article on gambling he had been asked to write for an Oxford University magazine. He drove Hicks-Beach home for about 8:00pm, not in his Mercedes-Benz, but in [...] "an old, dark and scruffy Ford", possibly the Ford Corsair he borrowed from Michael Stoop several weeks earlier. At 8:30pm he called the Clermont to check on a reservation for dinner with Greville Howard and friends. Howard <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> at 5:15pm and asked if he wished to come to the theatre, but Lucan had declined and made the alternative suggestion to meet at the Clermont at 11:00pm. He failed to arrive and did not answer his telephone when called.|$|E

500|$|At {{the podium}} interviews, {{conducted}} by former Formula One driver Martin Brundle, Hamilton thanked his team and expressed satisfaction {{about how the}} race went. He pointed {{to the problems of}} driving on the full wet tyres for such a long distance, saying that they were about to [...] "drop off", meaning to lose much of their grip to the race surface, when he came in to change. He complimented Ricciardo on driving [...] "phenomenally all weekend". Ricciardo himself lamented his misfortune in losing the race during his second pit stop. In regard to his team's error and their different strategy at the previous race in Spain, which he felt had cost him a chance at victory there as well, he said: [...] "Two weekends in a row I've been screwed now. It sucks. It hurts." [...] He emphasised that it had not been his decision to pit at that time, but that the team <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> in and criticised them for not being ready when he arrived. Sergio Pérez on the other hand was [...] "extremely happy" [...] with the performance by him and the team, saying that the race was his favourite podium finish while driving for Force India.|$|E
500|$|Subramanian Swamy, a {{politician}} of the BJP, {{has tried to}} fight this case against Tharoor in January 2015. Again this case is active and subjudice. On 20 May 2015 a trial court allowed the Delhi Police to conduct lie detector test on three suspects related to her death. The case became a talking point again in 2017 {{after the release of}} a series of secret video tapes by Republic TV in connection to Sunanda's death.. Key alleged claims included: (a) Sunanda's body was moved from room No. 307 to 345 of Leela indicating that the murder scene and body was tampered with before the investigation began. (b) Shashi Tharoor had re-visited the hotel after leaving it at 6.30 am, and had hid this piece of information when investigated. (c) Taped evidence emerged of the Shashi and Sunanda having [...] "fought all night" [...] on the day of her murder [...] (d) On October 10, 2014, Tharoor tried to influence the 'HM' through Rajan Rao, a Delhi-based operative. Rajan Rao is the same individual who had previously claimed that he was Shashi Tharoor's [...] "friend" [...] and had also claimed that Shashi Tharoor's ex-OSD <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> on the day Sunanda was found dead.|$|E
500|$|The {{prosecution}} based much of {{its case}} on the testimony of Jim Conley, the factory's janitor, who is believed by many historians [...] to be the actual murderer. The police had arrested Conley on May 1 {{after he had been}} seen washing red stains out of a blue work shirt; detectives examined it for blood, but determined that it was rust as Conley had claimed, and returned it. Conley was still in police custody two weeks later when he gave his first formal statement. He said that, {{on the day of the}} murder, he had been visiting saloons, shooting dice, and drinking. His story was called into question when a witness told detectives that [...] "a black negro... dressed in dark blue clothing and hat" [...] had been seen in the lobby of the factory on the day of the murder. Further investigation determined that Conley could read and write, and there were similarities in his spelling with that found on the murder notes. On May 24, he admitted he had written the notes, swearing that Frank <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> to his office the day before the murder and told him to write them. After testing Conley again on his spellinghe spelled [...] "night watchman" [...] as [...] "night witch"the police were convinced he had written the notes. They were skeptical about the rest of his story, not only because it implied premeditation by Frank, but also because it suggested that Frank had confessed to Conley and involved him.|$|E
