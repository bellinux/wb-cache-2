25|$|The IDeAs Z2 Design Facility is a net zero energy, {{zero carbon}} {{retrofit}} project occupied since 2007. It uses {{less than one}} fourth the energy of a typical U.S. office by applying strategies such as daylighting, radiant heating/cooling with a ground-source heat pump and high energy performance lighting and computing. The remaining energy demand is met with renewable energy from its building-integrated photovoltaic array. In 2009, building owner and occupant Integrated Design Associates (IDeAs) recorded actual measured energy use intensity of 21.17 kbtu/sf-year, with 21.72 kbtu/sf-year produced, for a net of −0.55 kbtu/sf-yr.

50|$|The real {{cause of}} the {{explosion}} was a gas leak from a damaged pipe located underneath the sidewalk. The gas got into an underground telephone connection and gathered {{in the basement of}} the Rotunda. Frozen water and snow clogged all the air vents, and in those circumstances, one spark or the turning on of a light in the basement, was enough to ignite the powerful explosion. The Rotunda itself did not have a <b>gas</b> <b>connection.</b> The low temperature caused the odorant to condense, and nobody was warned of a leak.|$|E

50|$|India {{has become}} world’s second largest LPG importer, a {{position}} that was previously occupied by Japan. China remains as the world’s top importer. According to Petroleum Planning & Analysis Cell, LPG imports in the country has increased 23% during the financial year 2016-2017 to about 11 million tonnes. The main reason behind {{the increase in the}} consumption of LPG in India is due to the two government schemes coupled with free <b>gas</b> <b>connections.</b> From May 2016, the government is providing free cooking <b>gas</b> <b>connections</b> to women from extremely poor households, to reduce the use of polluting fuels such as wood and dried cow dung. This has increased India’s active LPG users to about 200 million, which is 60% more than Japan’s entire population. According to the World Health Organization, polluting fuels used for cooking purposes results in 1.3 million premature deaths in India every year. India has set an ambitious target of increasing LPG usage to cover 80% of the households by March 2019. As per the present estimates of the oil ministry, demand for fuel will touch 35 million tonnes by 2031-32 in India.|$|R

50|$|The first {{explosion}} {{occurred at}} around 00:56 EET in a nightclub in Sighetu Marmației. Approximately 120 {{people were in}} the club at that time.

The police hypothesis was that the explosion occurred due to accumulation of combustible gases coming not from the club, but from a nearby house. According to investigators, 7 young women were smoking in the club's bathroom, which triggered the explosion.|$|E
