40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the physicochemical properties as well as the fertilizing and crop-yielding value of straw and cellulose manure after a 6 -month storage period. Before field application pH value and contents of dry matter, TC, Corg. and N in cellulose manure were higher than in straw manure. The application of cellulose manure caused an increase in pH and the contents of P and K in the soil. The contents of DM, TC, Corg., as well as N and P in the rye <b>grain</b> <b>collected</b> from a field with cellulose manure were higher than in the rye <b>grain</b> <b>collected</b> from a field with straw manure. It follows that the soil fertilized with the cellulose manure was more conducive to the mineralization and sorption of macroelements assimilable by plants.

50|$|Grain {{supply was}} an {{important}} issue for the Gracchi, with the elder brother Tiberius Gracchus arguing that consolidation of Roman agricultural lands {{in the hands of}} a few had pushed landless Romans into the city, where they found poverty rather than employment. Under the grain law of Gaius Gracchus in 123 BC, a portion of the <b>grain</b> <b>collected</b> as revenue for the state was sold at a subsidised rate to citizens. The grain supply was a consistent plank in the popularist platform for political leaders who appealed to the plebs.

The analyses were performed on grain of varying ripeness (waxy, full post-harvest dormancy) and at various stages of germination (24, 48 h).

40|$|The genus Cardiandra is {{assigned}} {{either to the}} family Saxifragaceae (BENTHAM & HOOKER 1865; ENGLER 1930; H. OHBA 1985 a, b) or to the family Hydrangeaceae (HUTCHINSON 1973; AIRY SHAW 1973; CRONQUIST 1981) {{which is one of}} families established by subdividing the Saxifragaceae into small families. The genus is a small one which is composed of only two species (H. OHBA 1985 a, b). T. OHBA (1986) stated that individual plants of Cardiandra alternifolia grown at Mt. Hakone located {{in the western part of}} Kanagawa Profecture have vegetative characters different from individuals grown at different habitats, and furthermore stated that the individuals grown at Mt. Hakone should be treated as a new taxon, that is, C. alternifolia var. hakonensis. But unfortunately this is not effectively published yet. H. OHBA (1985 a) stated that the pollen grains of Cardiandra are microreticulate and their tectum seems to be consisting of sparse capitate columellae. Furthermore he stated that the feature is not found in the grains of the species of Hydrangea, which is considered to be closely related to Cardiandra by taxonomists. So we morphologically investigated pollen grains of C. alternifolia from Mt. Hakone and from Mt. Kiyosumi located at the southern part of Chiba Prefecture. The feature of pollen grains of C. alternifolia from both habitats gave nearly entire agreement with H. OHBA'S description (1985 a) on the pollen grains of the genus Cardiandra. In our SEM (scanning electron microscope) observation, however, we rarely observed the grains (Fig. 4) with reticulation pattern on their sporoderms in pollen materials collected from individuals from Mt. Kiyosumi. Some species of Hydrangea have reticulate grains (Fig. 6) which are similar to the reticulate grains found first in our SEM observation. This seems to show that Cardiandra is closely related to Hydrangea. The <b>grains</b> <b>collected</b> from individual from Mt. Hakone are larger than those from Mt. Kiyosumi (Tab. 1, Figs. 2 C, D). The variation range of the former in pollen size is wider than that of the latter (Figs. 2 C, D). The mode value in the histogram (Fig. 2 C) presenting the variation range in the size of pollen <b>grains</b> <b>collected</b> from individuals from Mt. Kiyosumi is beyond the range of variation (Fig. 2 D) in size of pollen collected from individuals from Mt. Hakone. These facts seem to show that the variation in the size of pollen <b>grains</b> <b>collected</b> from Mt. Kiyosumi and from Mt. Hakone is not placed in the same category. Furthermore, Mt. Hakone is situated at the northernmost part in the distribution region of the genus Cardiandra. Therefore, we have no objection to the treatment of C. alternifolia grown at Mt. Hakone as a new taxon...|$|R
40|$|The {{thermodynamic}} equilibrium of thermal dusty plasmas consisting of ionized gas (plasma) and solid particles (dust grains), which {{interact with each}} other, is studied. The tendency of grains in dusty plasmas to agglomerate corresponds to the tendency of dusty plasmas to balanced states. When grains agglomerate, electrical perturbations generated by each grain concentrate inside the agglomerate. The plasma is perturbed only by the agglomerate's exterior surface. The greater number of possible states for electrons and ions in plasma depends on the volume of perturbation of grains. The fewer are the perturbations the greater {{is the amount of}} possible states for electrons and ions in plasma. If the <b>grains</b> <b>collected</b> from a distance smaller than 8 Debye lengths, the total volume of perturbations is minimized; the free energy of the plasma is also minimized...|$|R
40|$|The {{concentrations}} of rare-earth elements (REEs) were analysed in paddy soil and rice <b>grains</b> <b>collected</b> from Kočani Field in eastern Macedonia.

The concentrations of REEs in unpolished rice from Kočani Field exhibited a similarly elevated HREE pattern, like paddy soils, with up to 6. 6 x 103 times lower values compared to those in the soil.
