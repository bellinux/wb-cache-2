5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} live {{in groups}} typically of 10–30 members, called pods, but group size varies from single {{individuals up to}} more than 1,000. Their diets consist mainly of <b>forage</b> <b>fish.</b> Dolphins often work as a team to harvest fish schools, but they also hunt individually. Dolphins search for prey primarily using echolocation, which is similar to sonar. They emit clicking sounds and listen for the return echos to determine the location and shape of nearby items, including potential prey. Bottlenose dolphins also use sound for communication, including squeaks and whistles, as well as sounds emitted through body movements, such as leaping from the water and slapping their tails on the water surface.|$|E
50|$|The Colville River used {{to host a}} small {{commercial}} fishery for Arctic ciscoes, and though the fishery is closed, the river delta is still potential habitat for Salmonidae fishes like broad whitefish and nearshore <b>forage</b> <b>fishes</b> like Arctic cod and capelin.|$|R
50|$|While {{primarily}} hunters, it {{is assumed}} that the mesolithic people were also <b>foraging,</b> <b>fishing,</b> and even farming on a most primitive scale.

40|$|Abstract only. I begin my talk by {{identifying}} the fish species that inhabit the California Current Large Marine ecosystem (CCLME). Next, I categorize these species into predator-prey and <b>forage</b> and non-forage <b>fishes.</b> I then present the current catches, landed values, payment to labour (wages), capital (profit) and payment to the resource owners (resource rent) from the forage and non-forage species in the CCLME.

5|$|In the Shetland Islands, sand eels (Ammodytes marinus) {{normally}} form {{at least}} 90% {{of the food}} fed to chicks. It was found that, in years where the availability of sand eels was low, breeding success rates fell, with many chicks starving to death. In Norway it is the herring (Clupea harengus) that is the mainstay of the diet. When herring numbers dwindled, so did puffin numbers. In Labrador the puffins seemed more flexible and when the staple <b>forage</b> <b>fish</b> capelin (Mallotus villosus) declined in availability, {{they were able to}} adapt and feed the chicks on other prey species.|$|E
5|$|Some 97% of {{the common}} thresher's diet is {{composed}} of bony fishes, mostly small schooling <b>forage</b> <b>fish</b> such as mackerel, bluefish, herring, needlefish, and lanternfish. Before striking, the sharks compact schools of prey by swimming around them and splashing the water with its tail, often in pairs or small groups. Threshers are also known to take large, solitary fishes such as lancetfish, as well as squid and other pelagic invertebrates. Off California, common threshers feed mostly on the northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), with Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), Pacific mackerel (Scomber japonicus), market squid (Loligo opalescens), and pelagic red crab (Pleuroncodes planipes) also being important food items. The sharks concentrate on a few prey species during cold water years, but become less discriminating during less productive, warmer El Niño periods.|$|E
5|$|Spinner {{sharks are}} swift and gregarious predators that feed {{on a wide}} variety of small bony fishes and cephalopods. When feeding on schools of <b>forage</b> <b>fish,</b> they will speed {{vertically}} through the school while spinning on their axis, erupting from the water at the end. Like other members of its family, the spinner shark is viviparous, with females bearing litters of three to 20 young every other year. The newborns are born in shallow nursery areas near the coast, and are relatively fast-growing. This species is not usually dangerous to humans, but may become belligerent when excited by food. Spinner sharks are valued by commercial fisheries across their range for their meat, fins, liver oil, and skin. They are also esteemed as strong fighters by recreational fishers. The IUCN has assessed this species as Near Threatened worldwide and Vulnerable off the southeastern United States.|$|E
500|$|Diet {{studies have}} shown {{alligator}} gar to be opportunistic piscivores, and even scavengers depending {{on the availability of}} their preferred food source. They occasionally ingest sport fish, but the majority of stomach content studies suggest they feed predominately on <b>forage</b> <b>fishes</b> such as gizzard shad as well as invertebrates, and water fowl.

40|$|We {{propose that}} as a super-abundant, top-level-predator, Sooty Shearwaters are an ideal California Current Ecosystem (CCE) {{bioindicator}} species. Sooty Shearwaters dominate the CCE avifauna during the spring-summer 'upwelling season' and depend on massive amounts of energy-dense <b>forage</b> <b>fishes</b> (anchovy, sardine, krill). We hypothesize that Sooty Shearwater distribution (and abundance), and residency patterns, are related to upwelling dynamics (i. e., offshore transport, upwelling retention, wind-stress curl) that structure and control bottom-up productivity and energy transfer through the CCE foodweb...|$|R
40|$|We {{conducted}} {{a series of}} size-structured laboratory experiments to quantify and compare the susceptibility of several estuarine and marine <b>forage</b> <b>fishes</b> to attack and capture by piscivorous predators. Size-dependent estimates of capture success, handling time, and prey profitability were generated from single-species experiments offering bay anchovy, Atlantic menhaden, Atlantic silverside, and age- 0 striped bass to piscivores. Bay anchovy and Atlantic menhaden were most susceptible to capture and yielded high profitability compared to Atlantic silverside and age- 0 striped bass prey. Variation in capture success among forage species was particularly influential in generating disparate profitability functions. Although morphological differences among forage species contributed to variation in susceptibility to predation, behavioral analyses indicated that variable reaction distances to approaching predators and activity levels of prey may explain a large fraction of the observed differences in susceptibility. When several forage species were offered to predators simultaneously in larger enclosures, mortality was highest and occurred earlier for bay anchovy and Atlantic menhaden compared to other prey, which points to the strong influence of predator captureVulnerability of marine <b>forage</b> <b>fishes</b> to piscivory: effects of prey behavior on susceptibility to attack and captur...|$|R
25|$|However, an {{even more}} {{extensive}} and sustainable coastal resource is <b>forage</b> <b>fish,</b> such as anchovies and herring. This fishery {{is an integral part}} of the pole and line tuna fishery, since tuna feed on the <b>forage</b> <b>fish.</b> Future development of the traditional pole and line tuna fishery depends on the availability of this bait fishery. Catch rate for <b>forage</b> <b>fish</b> have increased greatly in recent years, but there is not enough data to really know what the current status of the <b>forage</b> <b>fish</b> stocks are.|$|E
25|$|Though <b>forage</b> <b>fish</b> are abundant, {{there are}} {{relatively}} few species. There are more species of primary producers and apex predators {{in the ocean}} than there are <b>forage</b> <b>fish.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most filter-feeding {{pelagic fish}} found in coastal waters are small, silvery <b>forage</b> <b>fish.</b> <b>Forage</b> <b>fish</b> include fishes {{of the family}} Clupeidae (herrings, shad, {{sardines}} and pilchards, hilsa, menhaden and sprats), as well as anchovies, capelin and halfbeaks. They use schooling strategies to avoid predators, and different schools of <b>forage</b> <b>fish</b> often associate {{with each other in}} open coastal waters. <b>Forage</b> <b>fish</b> feed near the base of the food chain on plankton and fry (recently hatched fish), often by filter feeding. In turn, they are preyed on by larger predatory fish, seabirds and marine mammals.|$|E
50|$|Also, {{fish farming}} in the Mediterranean is a net fish consumer. Large amounts of animal feed {{are needed to}} feed a high trophic fish like the bluefin tuna. This feed {{consists}} of fishmeal processed from <b>forage</b> <b>fishes</b> like sardines and anchovies that humans would otherwise consume directly. In addition to ecological issues, this raises ethical issues. Much of the fish suitable for direct human consumption {{is being used to}} grow higher trophic level fish to indulge a relatively small group of affluent consumers.|$|R
50|$|The Bodega Head area {{contains}} one of {{the most}} persistent and important upwelling plumes along the entire California coast and provides for significant down stream larval dispersal, resulting in an area of high abundance and natural diversity. The area provides important habitat for nearshore, shelf and deeper nearshore rockfishes such as lingcod, kelp greenling and cabezon, as well as a diversity of benthic invertebrates. Murres, auklets, guillemots and marine mammals also depend on the habitat and <b>forage</b> <b>fishes</b> found here.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access until 6 th May 2018. Flume studies have {{demonstrated}} that <b>foraging</b> by <b>fish</b> can modify the structure and topography of gravel substrates, thereby increasing particle entrainment probabilities and the amount of sediment mobilized during subsequent experimental high flows. However, the zoogeomorphic impact of benthic foraging has not previously been investigated in the field. This paper reports field experiments that examined {{the nature and extent of}} disturbance of riverbed gravels by <b>foraging</b> <b>fish,</b> predominately Cyprinids, at patch, riffle, and reach scales and complementary ex situ experiments of the impacts on bed stability. At patch scale, benthic feeding fish displaced particle sizes ≤ 90 mm in diameter, increased bed surface microtopography and grain protrusion, and loosened surface structures. Although enhanced mobility was expected from these structural changes, foraging also caused localized coarsening of sediments, and the ex situ experiments recorded significantly reduced grain entrainment, bedload flux, and total transported mass from foraged patches. Foraging disturbed bed materials at all 12 riffles in the study reach and, on average, disturbed 26. 1 % of riffle area per 24 h feeding period. These findings demonstrate for the first time that <b>foraging</b> <b>fish,</b> which are widespread and feed perennially, can act as zoogeomorphic agents in rivers, affecting grain-size distributions and bed material structure, with potential implications for bed stability and bedload transport at reach and river scales. Whether fish increase or reduce bed mobility is probably dependent on a host of factors, including the net effects of both structural disturbance and biogenic particle sorting, as these affect entrainment stresses under subsequent competent flows...|$|R
25|$|Altogether, <b>forage</b> <b>fish</b> {{account for}} 37 percent (31.5 million tonnes) of all fish {{taken from the}} world's oceans each year. However, because there are fewer species of <b>forage</b> <b>fish</b> {{compared}} to predator fish, forage species fisheries are {{the largest in the}} world. Seven of the top ten fisheries target <b>forage</b> <b>fish.</b> The total world catch of herrings, sardines and anchovies alone in 2005 was 22.4 million tonnes, 24 percent of the total world catch.|$|E
25|$|Typical ocean <b>forage</b> <b>fish</b> are small, silvery {{schooling}} {{oily fish}} such as herring, anchovies and menhaden, and other small, schooling baitfish like capelin, smelts, sand lance, halfbeaks, pollock, butterfish and juvenile rockfish.

25|$|An {{example of}} a cascade in a complex, open-ocean {{ecosystem}} occurred in the northwest Atlantic during the 1980s and 1990s. The removal of cod (Gadus morhua) and other ground fishes by sustained overfishing resulted in increases in the abundance of the prey species for these ground <b>fishes,</b> particularly smaller <b>forage</b> <b>fishes</b> and invertebrates such as the northern snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) and northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis). The increased abundance of these prey species altered the community of zooplankton that serve as food for smaller fishes and invertebrates as an indirect effect.|$|R

25|$|<b>Forage</b> <b>fish</b> {{are small}} fish which are preyed on by larger predators for food. Predators include other larger fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Typical ocean <b>forage</b> <b>fish</b> are small, filter-feeding fish such as herring, {{anchovies}} and menhaden. <b>Forage</b> <b>fish</b> compensate for their small size by forming schools.

25|$|<b>Forage</b> <b>fish</b> are {{sometimes}} referred to as bait fish or feeder fish. Bait fish is a term used particularly by recreational fishermen, although commercial fisherman also catch fish to bait longlines and traps. <b>Forage</b> <b>fish</b> is a fisheries term, and is used in the context of fisheries. Bait fish, by contrast, are fish that are caught by humans to use as bait for other fish. The terms overlap in the sense that most bait fish are also <b>forage</b> <b>fish,</b> and vice versa. Feeder fish is a term used particularly in the context of fish aquariums. It refers essentially to the same concept as <b>forage</b> <b>fish,</b> small fish that are eaten by larger fish, but the term is adapted to the particular requirements of working with fish in aquariums.|$|E

25|$|Young <b>forage</b> <b>fish,</b> such as herring, mostly feed on {{phytoplankton}} {{and as they}} mature {{they start}} to consume larger organisms.

The amount of energy moved to higher trophic levels or new systems is directly linked to the consumption rate of pelagic <b>forage</b> <b>fishes.</b> In the Gulf of Maine, Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) is the dominant forage fish; {{the purpose of this}} study is to determine their specific consumption rate (g prey/g fish/day). Using fish collected in autumn 2012 and spring 2013, we applied a mercury mass-balance model to estimate individual and population consumption of Atlantic herring in the Gulf of Maine. Our results suggest that the specific consumption rate increases from age 1. 5 until age 6 (years) and then asymptotes. These estimates were contradictory to much of what exists in the literature; for most fishes, specific consumption estimates decrease with age and overall are much lower than our estimates. We looked further into our results to explore the underlying cause of the increase in specific consumption rate. We combined the mercury mass-balance model with a Wisconsin (WI) bioenergetics model and ran several simulations adjusting the most sensitive factors in each [...] prey mercury in the former and activity in the latter. The results of our simulations showed that an increase in activity relative to age and mass can best explain the increase in the consumption rate of Adult herring. This suggests that an ontogenetic shift to migration in adult Atlantic herring results in increased energy demand with age, and ultimately increased consumption...|$|R
