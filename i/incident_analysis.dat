5000|$|BAU {{assistance}} {{to law enforcement}} agencies is provided {{through the process of}} [...] "criminal investigative analysis". Criminal investigative analysis is a process of reviewing crimes from both a behavioral and investigative perspective. It involves reviewing and assessing the facts of a criminal act, interpreting offender behavior, and interaction with the victim, as exhibited during the commission of the crime, or as displayed in the crime scene. BAU staff conduct detailed analyses of crimes for the purpose of providing two {{or more of the following}} services: crime analysis, investigative suggestions, profiles of unknown offenders, threat analysis, critical <b>incident</b> <b>analysis,</b> interview strategies, major case management, search warrant assistance, prosecutive and trial strategies, and expert testimony.In addition to the above services, the BAU staff produced the Child Abduction Response Plan to assist investigators faced with these investigations. Recently, the BAU released [...] "The School Shooter: A Threat Assessment Perspective" [...] report to guide school administrators, teachers, parents, and law enforcement in identifying and evaluating threats in schools. The BAU maintains a reference file for experts in various forensic disciplines such as odontology, anthropology, entomology, or pathology.|$|E

5000|$|On April 12, 1977, Delta Airlines flight 1080, on takeoff from San Diego, had an undetected left {{stabilizer}} jammed in {{the full}} trailing-edge-up position. This failure resulted in a large noseup and rolling moment that almost exceeded the capability of the flight controls. The airplane {{was just about to}} stall in the clouds when Captain Jack McMahan, with unusual insight, reduced power on the wing engines and began using the throttles to supplement the remaining flight controls, using differential and collective engine thrust. Cabin crew moved all the passengers forward in the cabin to redistribute weight and help get the nose down. Steve Heidt, the flight engineer, said, [...] "It probably didn't help much, but in that situation we figured every little bit would help." [...] All the way from San Diego to Los Angeles, the aircraft flew with its pitch controlled by differential thrust between tail and wing engines, while the left roll tendency was compensated by wing differential thrust, and made a successful emergency landing in Los Angeles. According to <b>incident</b> <b>analysis</b> by Warren VanderBurgh, comprehensive crew training {{played a critical role in}} control recovery.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the concept of}} critical <b>incident</b> <b>analysis</b> in respect of improving the pedagogical practices in teaching dyslexic undergraduate biosciences students. Critical <b>incident</b> <b>analysis</b> is a well established pedagogical theory (Tripp, 1993) that allows reflection of a seemingly typical incident; the ‘critical incident’, so that changes and improvements can be implemented in teaching practices. In particular, it offers the opportunity to reflect upon these incidents and adopt different strategies by using the paradigms as described by Tripp and colleagues and uses these to foster improvement in teaching practice. However, the implementation of paradigms adopted by critical <b>incident</b> <b>analysis</b> and its reflective description in analysing an incident is currently lacking in undergraduate Bioscience. In view {{of the importance of}} critical <b>incident</b> <b>analysis,</b> here I describe the content and reflective pedagogical approaches adopted by critical <b>incident</b> <b>analysis</b> and incorporate its key principles into improving the methods and perception of teaching a dyslexic undergraduate student...|$|E
40|$|Using {{a survey}} of {{students}} from two national groups as an example, this paper shows how culture-contrastive research can be performed utilizing an extended version of the critical <b>incident</b> <b>analysis</b> (ECIA). Although it is a classic intercultural research instrument, the use of critical incidents can present methodological problems. Based on a study which was aimed at identifying communication barriers between German and Polish students at a cross-border university, an analysis method which combines traditional qualitative methods with critical <b>incident</b> <b>analysis</b> was created. The ECIA was developed {{as a response to}} the common criticisms of approaches based on critical <b>incident</b> <b>analysis.</b> By linking problem-centered interviews (WITZEL, 2000), the introduction of indicators, a codification of data, and expert opinions to critical <b>incident</b> <b>analysis,</b> the ECIA presents an application-oriented qualitative method that can be used to identify specific, relevant sources of problems in intercultural encounters.

40|$|As {{a teacher}} {{educator}} I consider myself {{an advocate for}} research-informed education, and strongly believe that it starts with one’s own critical self-reflection and analysis of one’s own teaching practice. Critical <b>incident</b> <b>analysis</b> is a pedagogical theory developed by Tripp (1993), whose analytical approaches allow reflection on teaching situations – ‘the critical incident’ – so that teachers can develop their professional judgments and practices. This article examines the concept of critical <b>incident</b> <b>analysis</b> through a teaching situation, {{with the aim of}} improving the teaching practice of students on teacher education programmes. I conclude that although critical <b>incident</b> <b>analysis</b> is a useful tool in navigating teaching practices, often challenges need to be addressed at much broader levels than the teaching context itself...|$|E
40|$|Network traffic logs play an {{important}} role in <b>incident</b> <b>analysis.</b> With the increasing throughput of network links, maintaining a complete log of all network activity has become a task that requires an enormous amount of resources. We propose an approach to network monitoring that mitigates the resource consumption problem while still providing effective support to evidence collection and <b>incident</b> <b>analysis.</b> The approach relies on a tool, called MNEMOSYNE, that maintains a sliding window containing the traffic that has been recently seen on a network link. MNEMOSYNE provides improved logging features, such as multiple streams, support for cross-stream queries, and dynamic remote reconfiguration. By integrating MNEMOSYNE with real-time intrusion detection capability, it is possible to provide <b>incident</b> <b>analysis</b> functionality and effective evidence collection, without having to maintain complete traffic logs. This paper describes the MNEMOSYNE tool, its architecture, and presents the results of the quantitative evaluation of its performance...|$|E
40|$|Many {{incidents}} {{have occurred}} because industries have ignored past incidents {{or failed to}} learn lessons from the past. Incident databases provide an effective option for managing large amounts {{of information about the}} past <b>incidents.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of data stored in existing databases can lead to useful conclusions and reduction of chemical incidents and consequences of incidents. An incident database is a knowledge based system that can give an insight to the situation which led to an <b>incident.</b> Effective <b>analysis</b> of data from a database can help in development of information that can help reduce future incidents: cause of an incident, critical equipment, the type of chemical released, and the type of injury and victim. In this research, Hazardous Substances Emergency Events Surveillance (HSEES) database has been analyzed focusing on manufacturing events in Texas from 1993 - 2004. Between thirteen to sixteen states have participated in the HSEES incident reporting system and it does not include all the near miss incidents. Petroleum related incidents are also excluded from the HSEES system. Studies show that HSEES covers only 37 % of all incidents in the US. This scaling ratio was used to estimate the total universe size...|$|R

40|$|<b>Incident</b> <b>analysis</b> is {{commonly}} used as a tooi to provide {{information on how to}} improve health and safety in complex work environments. The effectiveness of this tooi, however, depends on how the analysis is actually carried out. The traditional view on <b>incident</b> <b>analysis</b> highlights the role of human and technical failure in incident causation. More recently, the importance of the organisational factors underlying these human and technical failures has been acknowledged. Furthermore, <b>incident</b> <b>analysis</b> has traditionally focused on the failure side of incident causation, ignoring the potentialof human recovery in minimising the negative outcomes of the incident process. The recent emphasis on organisational failure has not vet resulted in any practical tools for detecting, describing and classifying organisational factors. The study outlined in this chapter presents the development of a taxonomy for classifying the organisational factors underlying incidents. The taxonomy was originally developed in the Dutch steel industry and has subsequently been applied in various settings in the medical domain. The application of the taxonomy in an Anaesthesia department and an Intensive Care Unit are discussed in detail. The analysis of recent incidents within these departments demonstrates both the contribution of organisational failures in incident causation and the contribution of human recovery in preventing minor incidents from developing into major accidents. The chapter concludes with suggestions on how to widen the scope of <b>incident</b> <b>analysis</b> in complex work environments, in order to raise its effectiveness as a tool for improving health and safety...|$|E

30|$|To {{effectively}} support different traffic {{incident management}} strategies and applications, an appropriate method that {{can determine the}} significant factors for the traffic incident duration and prediction techniques to match various circumstances and data resources {{in a timely manner}} to predict traffic incident duration must be applied. This study reviews the literature on traffic <b>incident</b> duration <b>analysis</b> and prediction.

We then investigated the various techniques employed in traffic <b>incident</b> duration <b>analysis</b> and prediction. Finally, we analysed several challenges in future research and application, such as how to combine extensive data resources, the time sequential prediction model, outlier prediction, improvement of prediction methods, combining recovery times, and influence of unobserved factors.|$|R

In order to get a high degree of reliability and robustness,an original combination of three different algorithms is performed. Low level results from the first two algorithms are used to compute a reliability indicator and to update a high level model through the third algorithm using Kalman filtering. Searching areas of the roadsides for the next image are also updated. Results obtained {{in the context of the}} ARCOS 1 French project show the reliability,the robustness and the precision of this original association of three different algorithms in various situations,including roads with high curvature. ...|$|R
