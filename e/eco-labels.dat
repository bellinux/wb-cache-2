40|$|Due to the {{interdisciplinary}} nature of <b>eco-labelling,</b> {{the sense of}} the phenomenon itself is lost when studied in isolation. With this consideration, a balance of research between practical and theoretical approaches, between environmental sociology, environmental economics, international trade relations, consumer society, sustainability and marketing theory was explored. <b>Eco-labelling</b> has far-reaching ramifications in society, not just in the commercial relationship between producer and consumer, but in socio-cultural norms and values. It combines economic and social forces via the marketplace. The research of this paper focuses on 1) the socio-cultural aspects of <b>eco-labelling,</b> 2) the economic incentive which drives <b>eco-labelling</b> and 3) the global institutional structures which influence the <b>eco-labelling</b> dimension. Chapter 1 provides an overview of <b>eco-labelling</b> and introduces ecological modernization, the theoretical foundation of this paper. Chapter 2 is a summary of interviews which were conducted with <b>eco-labelling</b> managers around the world. Chapter 3 analyses the economic impact of <b>eco-labelling,</b> the effects on international trade and the environment, and how <b>eco-labelling</b> affects consumers and producers. Chapter 4 deals with the social context of <b>eco-labelling,</b> and the social paradigms of consumer society and sustainability, merging in the case of ecological modernization. Chapter 5 looks at opportunities and challenges to <b>eco-labelling,</b> and concrete recommendations with respect to the design of <b>eco-labelling</b> programmes are made. <b>Eco-labelling</b> is the only tool which functions within the conflicting social forces of consumer society and sustainability. As a market-based instrument for environmental management that functions within the producer - consumer relationship, <b>eco-labelling</b> {{can be seen as the}} ecological marketisation of consumer society.

40|$|<b>Eco-labeling</b> is a {{communication}} tool that allows producers {{to demonstrate to}} consumers that they comply {{with a set of}} environmental and social criteria by placing an <b>eco-label</b> on their product. Since global aquaculture production is increasing and bivalve mollusks comprise a large share of the world aquaculture production, <b>eco-labeling</b> certification has been suggested as a tool for creating a market for products that are produced with minimal negative environmental and social impacts. Because <b>eco-labeling</b> certification programs for bivalve aquaculture are currently voluntary in the United States, producers 2 ̆ 7 opinions of these programs influence their current and future involvement in these programs. ^ Rhode Island (RI), where aquaculturists almost exclusively raise bivalves, provided a valuable case study for understanding aquaculturists 2 ̆ 7 opinions of <b>eco-labeling</b> certification programs for shellfish aquaculture. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} investigate RI bivalve mollusk aquaculturists 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of <b>eco-labeling</b> certification programs to explore the potential role of <b>eco-labeling</b> in RI aquaculture. To meet this objective, the study focused on four research areas to 1.) gather basic characteristics of RI aquaculture producers, farms and products; 2.) learn if RI aquaculturists participate or plan to participate in <b>eco-labeling</b> programs, and their perceptions of eco-labeling; 3.) discover perceived incentives and disincentives for participation in <b>eco-labeling</b> programs; and 4.) understand how RI aquaculturists feel about government regulations of aquaculture. To explore these research areas, the researcher interviewed twelve RI aquaculturists, in which participants were asked a combination of open- and closed-ended questions. Data in this study was summarized by descriptive statistics and open-ended questions were coded by themes that emerged. ^ Results showed that while nearly all respondents support <b>eco-labeling</b> programs, none of the respondents currently participate in <b>eco-labeling</b> certification programs, and only one aquaculturist plans to seek <b>eco-labeling</b> certification within the next five to ten years. This study found that most aquaculturists were unaware of the <b>eco-labeling</b> programs available for aquaculture and unsure about how they would choose between certification programs. Most aquaculturists would be more likely to certify their products with an <b>eco-label</b> if their competitors sought certification and most aquaculturists would be more likely to seek certification if they were involved in developing the certification standards. Obtaining a price premium from certification was the strongest incentive for participation in <b>eco-labeling</b> programs, while certification costs and additional recordkeeping required for certification were identified as the strongest disincentives. Management recommendations were provided for <b>eco-labeling</b> certification programs, aquaculturists, academics, and government regulators, as well as recommendations for future studies. ...|$|R
