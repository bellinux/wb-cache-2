40|$|Because {{of their}} {{rheological}} properties various microbial polysaccharides are applied as thickeners and viscosifiers both {{in food and}} <b>non-food</b> <b>industries.</b> A broad variety of microorganisms secrete structurally diverse exopolysaccharides (EPS) that contribute to their surface attachment, protection against abiotic or biotic stress factors, and nutrient gathering. Theoretically, a massive number of EPS structures are possible through variations in monosaccharide sequences, condensation linkages and non-sugar decorations. Given the already-high diversity of EPS structures, taken together with the principal of combinatorial biosynthetic pathways, microbial polysaccharides are an attractive class of macromolecules with which to generate novel structures via synthetic biology approaches. However, previous manipulations primarily focused on increasing polysaccharide yield, with structural modifications restricted to removal of side chains or non-sugar decorations. This article outlines the biosynthetic pathways of the bacterial heteroexopolysaccharides xanthan and succinoglycan, which are used as thickening and stabilizing agents in food and <b>non-food</b> <b>industries.</b> Challenges and perspectives of combining synthetic biology approaches with directed evolution to overcome obstacles in assembly of novel EPS biosynthesis pathways are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{extraction}} {{and processing}} of starch from agricultural commodities {{is one of}} the most important agro-industries world wide. By the early 1990 s, global production of starch probably exceeded 38 million metric tons (mmt) per year for a market value of at least $ 11 billion. In Asia, starch production was about 16 mmt and demand for starch by food and <b>non-food</b> <b>industries</b> was growing by 5 - 10 percent per year. Starch is very versatile and has a wide variety of uses. Almost all major industries have found some uses for starch. In food industries, starch is used to impart “functional” properties to processed foods such as thickening, binding, filling, and taste. Starch is used in canned soups, instant desserts, ice creams, processed meats, sauces, and bakery products. Starch can also be converted into sugar. It is used to manufacture sweeteners and syrups and to feed enzymes for the manufacture of MSG, a popular taste enhancer. Uses of starch in <b>non-food</b> <b>industries</b> are just as numerous. Major users include the textile, paper, plywood, and adhesive industries. Starch is also used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals. Starch is not a uniform commodity, however.

The computed Herfindahl index was found too low to have any influence on margins and hence oligopsonist powers could not be confirmed. Instead traders’ margins depend on costs, risk and uncertainty that they face.

In this perspective, the optimization of nitrogen and carbon source uptake for starch accumulation is a critical point for reducing the nitrogen requirement footprint and to increase CO 2 capture.

C. sorokiniana was selected as the best starch producer in the biorefinery context, and the role nitrogen and CO 2 concentration had on the starch production was investigated. For light irradiance of 300 μmol m− 2 s− 1 the optimal nitrogen concentration for growth and starch accumulation resulted 32 mg L− 1. The CO 2 concentration clearly does not influence the starch accumulation, but concentrations distant from 2 % negatively influence microalgal growth, affecting the final starch productivity. The biomass composition during the batch growth of C. sorokiniana was also analysed in order to explicitly characterise the dynamic of starch accumulation during the different growth phases. Protein content decreased during N-depletion, carbohydrates were mainly produced during the early N-depletion, followed by the accumulation of lipids in the late depletion...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the genetic}} {{organization}} and the regulatory mechanisms involved in carbohydrate and storage protein accumulation in maize seed may give use to novel approaches for increasing the nutritional value of grain and for producing materials for <b>non-food</b> manufacturing <b>industries.</b> In this review we have attempted to cover the recent research related to regulatory mechanisms of starch and storage protein synthesis in the maize seeds. In particular, we focus our attention on the developmental genetic and environmental factors which appear to influence the composition of carbohydrate and storage protein fractions in the seed. Genetic and molecular approaches for upgrading grain protein and starch quantity, and quality of maize grains are also discussed...|$|R
30|$|Starch {{is next to}} {{cellulose}} and chitin, {{the most}} important carbohydrate in the plant system (Tharanthan 2005). Structurally, it is mainly composed of two polysaccharides namely amylose and amylopectin which are enclosed in microscopic particles called granules (BeMiller 1997). As not only {{the main source of}} food for human, starch is a renewable polymer widely used in an impressive range of products in food and <b>non-food</b> <b>industries.</b> As a biodegradable material with controllable lifetimes, the attention paid to starch is growing as the years pass. Indeed, starch is increasingly used as substitute for non-renewable fossil fuel in plastics production (Singh et al. 2010; Akpa and Dagde 2012). Elsewhere, in medicine for example, four new types of starches called resistant starches (RS), are used to solve problems of nutrition in diabetes and other related diseases (Nugent 2005). Resistant starches are defined as starches or starch degradation products that escape from digestion in the small intestine of healthy individuals. These starches can be obtained in their nature state (RS type I or II) in whole seeds, legumes, grains, unripe bananas and potatoes (Moongngarm 2013), or by retrogradation of amylose molecules (RS III) after moisten, heating and cooling treatments (Eerlingen et al. 1993). The last type of resistant starch are obtained by chemical modification (RS IV) and could have a wide variety of structures not found in nature (Fuentes-Zaragoza et al. 2010). In view of all these potentialities, it seems obvious that nowadays, practically every industry in existence uses starch or its derivatives {{in one form or another}} for specific applications.|$|R
40|$|Palm oil is an {{important}} and versatile raw material for both food and <b>non-food</b> <b>industries.</b> It is the largest edible oil accounted for 27 % or some 45 million tones of world oil and fats production in 2009 and it replaced coconut oil and tallow as the main feedstock for the global oleochemical industry. Palm oil is also becoming a more important raw material for transport biofuels. Rising oil prices along with strong intention to reduce GHG emissions of transport sector has driven up demand for palm oil as feedstock for transport biofuel, owing largely to its remarkably higher annual oil yield and lower production costs compared with other vegetable oils such as soybean, sunflower, rapeseed. In 2009, 2. 5 million tones of palm oil were used globally for biodiesel production. In domestic market, palm oil plays {{an important}} role in supporting Malaysia’s economy. It dominates the local edible oil market, and is the indigenous raw material to oleochemical and food industries in Malaysia. With its large and growing palm oil industry, Malaysia has the potential to play a major role in the world food and biofuel markets. This paper aims to perform quantitative analysis on (1) domestic supply and demand outlook of Malaysia’s palm oil, including biodiesel demand; and (2) its ability to supply to the global markets to 2035 in the context of restricted expansion of palm oil plantation area. Methods Fig. 1 showed the schematic flow of this study. We developed and linked a palm oil sub-model with ou...|$|R
