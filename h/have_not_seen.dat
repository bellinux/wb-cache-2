25|$|Charlie {{is married}} to Nancy and {{is part of the}} human couple {{at the center of the}} play. Unlike his wife, Charlie is fearful and passive. While Nancy wants to have an active retirement, Charlie wants to rest and do nothing. He does not {{understand}} his wife's need to connect with the past and explore the world they <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen.</b> Charlie admits to having a more adventurous spirit in his youth. He would release his breath and sink to the bottom of pools or other bodies of water until he had to rise to breathe again. Charlie liked to do this then but has no desire to do it now. He is content with the way things currently are in his life and does not like to be challenged.|$|E

25|$|Police interviewed Edith Grimes, who {{stated the}} man her sister knew as Frederick Hudson was {{actually}} named Frederick Nodder, who had adopted the surname Hudson as an alias, since becoming {{the subject of}} an affiliation order. Grimes described Nodder as being a brutish and squalid drunkard with poor personal hygiene and few friends, who worked primarily as a motor mechanic and lorry driver in Retford. Nodder had, Grimes stated, deserted his wife many years before he had lodged with them. However, she claimed and to be unaware of his current address, and to <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> him for several months (this was contradicted by a neighbour of the Grimes family, who recalled seeing a lorry driver fitting Nodder's description at their home shortly after Christmas 1936). Enquiries in public houses and garages in Retford quickly led officers to the Retford haulage firm with which Nodder was employed; this firm was able to provide police with Nodder's current address on Smeath Road in the Nottinghamshire village of Hayton.|$|E
25|$|The scene changes {{again to}} a fairy garden with a palace in the {{background}} out of which Ada comes. She sings of how she is willing to sacrifice her immortality and pay the price, however hard it is, necessary to win Arindal (Wie muss ich doch beklagen). Arindal awakens and declares his joy at seeing Ada again, but she announces that he will abandon her the next day. Gernot, Gunther and Morald arrive with companions to fetch Arindal. Those who <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> her before are struck by Ada's beauty and fear Arindal will not come. A procession of fairies {{comes out of the}} palace and Zemina and Farzana tell Ada that her father has died and she is now queen. Ada tells Arindal that they must part now but she will see him tomorrow. She asks him to swear that whatever happens he will not curse her. He swears it even though she takes back her request. She expresses her fear that they will both go under {{as a result of his}} breaking the oath.|$|E
25|$|I <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> Chas. Greville's book, {{but have}} read {{a good deal}} of it. It is a social outrage. And {{committed}} by one who was always talking of what he called ‘perfect gentlemen.’ I don't think he can figure now in that category. I knew him intimately. He was the vainest being—I don't limit myself to man—that ever existed; and I don't forget Cicero and Lytton Bulwer; but Greville wd. swallow garbage, and required it. Offended selflove is a key to most of his observations. He lent me a volume of his MS. once to read; more modern than these; I found, when he was not scandalous, he was prolix and prosy—a clumsy, wordy writer. The loan was made à propos of the character of Peel, which I drew in George Bentinck's Life, and which, I will presume to say, is the only thing written about Peel wh. has any truth or stuff in it. Greville was not displeased with it, and as a reward, and a treat, told me that he wd. confide to me his character of Peel, and he gave me the sacred volume, wh. I bore with me, with trembling awe, from Bruton St. to Grosr Gate. If ever it appears, you, who have taste for style and expression, will, I am sure, agree with me that, as a portrait painter, Greville is not a literary Vandyke or Reynolds; a more verbose, indefinite, unwieldy affair, without a happy expression, never issued from the pen of a fagged subordinate of the daily press.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the story}} is often {{included}} amongst the short list of detective stories by Poe, [...] "The Gold-Bug" [...] is not technically detective fiction because Legrand withholds the evidence until after the solution is given. Nevertheless, the Legrand character is often compared to Poe's fictional detective C. Auguste Dupin due to his use of [...] "ratiocination". [...] "Ratiocination", a term Poe used to describe Dupin's method, is {{the process by which}} Dupin detects what others <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> or what others have deemed unimportant.|$|E

[...] In February, it was reported that Israel would officially ask the Palestinian Authority to carry out repairs at the tomb, but in response, vandals set tires on fire inside the tomb. In December 2008, Jewish workers funded by anonymous donors painted the blackened walls and re-built the shattered stone marker covering the grave.|$|E

He went on to say: [...] "Until today I <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> a single incident or example of rape with a respected lady.

500|$|The Peregrine, by J. A. Baker, {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the best nature books in English written in the twentieth century. Admirers of the book include Robert Macfarlane, Mark Cocker, who regards the book as [...] "one of the most outstanding books on nature in the twentieth century" [...] and Werner Herzog, who called it [...] "the one book I would ask you to read if you want to make films," [...] and said elsewhere [...] "... it has prose of the calibre that we <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> since Joseph Conrad." [...] In the book, Baker recounts, in diary form, his detailed observations of peregrines (and their interaction with other birds) near his home in Chelmsford, Essex, over a single winter from October to April.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{opens with}} Martin [...] "Marty" [...] Hart (Woody Harrelson), a {{homicide}} detective of the Louisiana State Police's Criminal Investigations Division, beginning {{an interview with}} detectives Maynard Gilbough (Michael Potts) and Thomas Papania (Tory Kittles). His former partner, Detective Rustin [...] "Rust" [...] Cohle (Matthew McConaughey), is being questioned separately; they <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> nor spoken to each other since an altercation over a decade ago. The two men are asked to recount their relationship {{and the history of}} the Dora Lange murder investigation of 1995, the files of which were destroyed in Hurricane Rita. Martin and Rustin claim to have apprehended the killer, but the crime scene of a recently slain woman is found to closely mirror the Dora Lange murder scene, leading investigators to believe that the perpetrator is still at large.|$|E
