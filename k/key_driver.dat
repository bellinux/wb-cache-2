25|$|The {{return of}} the boom in 2004 was claimed to be {{primarily}} {{the result of the}} large construction sector's catching up with the demand caused by the first boom. The construction sector represented nearly 12% of GDP and a large proportion of employment among young, unskilled men. A number of sources, including The Economist, warned of excessive Irish property values. 2004 saw the construction of 80,000 new homes, compared to the UK's 160,000– a nation that has 15 times Ireland's population.

25|$|There are {{a variety}} of ideas which promote a {{specific}} change in behaviour as the <b>key</b> <b>driver</b> for the evolution of hominid bipedalism. For example, Wescott (1967) and later Jablonski & Chaplin (1993) suggest that bipedal threat displays could have been the transitional behaviour which led to some groups of apes beginning to adopt bipedal postures more often. Others (e.g. Dart 1925) have offered the idea that the need for more vigilance against predators could have provided the initial motivation. Dawkins (e.g. 2004) has argued that it could have begun as a kind of fashion that just caught on and then escalated through sexual selection. And it has even been suggested (e.g. Tanner 1981:165) that male phallic display could have been the initial incentive, as well as increased sexual signaling in upright female posture.|$|E
25|$|The Mark 2 has a semi-integral construction, {{giving it}} more {{strength}} than a Mark 1 {{in the event}} of an accident, although a <b>key</b> <b>driver</b> of the changed construction method was to overcome the serious corrosion problem point in the Mark 1 at the base of the body, where it was attached to the underframe. Other changes of design, such as the window units, were for the same reason, which had become a serious problem in Mark 1 vehicle maintenance costs. Revised painting methods were also part of this, which coincided with the change of livery from maroon (dark green on the Southern) to the blue and grey that Mark 2 coaches wore for much of their lives (some of the earliest Mark 2 coaches had the old livery at first).|$|E
25|$|Internal politics, {{diplomacy}} and leadership also key factors in military evolution. Some scholars {{maintain that the}} key to understanding African warfare lies in the political institutions and processes of the African landscape, where a massive number of small polities greatly outnumbered large empires or nations. The consolidation of these small polities into larger units sparked a growth in mass-recruited armies, a development that was more decisive overall than the appearance of gunpowder weapons. The Asante for example rose to power first through larger mass armies equipped with traditional bows, arrows and spears. Firearms were only to come later, after the crucial formative period. The <b>key</b> <b>driver</b> in the development of African military systems is thus the internal dynamics of particular indigenous states or kingdoms. The deployment of technology was ultimately shaped in this context.|$|E

The CLRC was disbanded in 2005 by the Australian government after it had produced a number of reports.

In a 1999 government report that was a <b>key</b> <b>driver</b> in the passage of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000—legislation that clarified that most over-the-counter derivatives were outside the regulatory authority of any government agency—Greenspan was joined by Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman William Ranier in concluding that [...] "under many circumstances, the trading of financial derivatives by eligible swap participants should be excluded from the CEA" [...] (Commodity Exchange Act).

The population’s dependence on fuelwood for energy creates rings of fragmented forest around urban areas, which in turn calls for longer and longer forest excursions to supply a never ending demand for fuelwood. The United Nations Environment Prorgamme’s Post-conflict Environmental Assessment Synthesis for Policy Makers reported that approximately 89 heactares of forest was lost each day due to illegal fuelwood harvesting during the peak of the post-Second Congo War conflict.

2500|$|After being a {{standout}} in the 2017 pre-season according to Melbourne's development and strategy coach, Brendan McCartney, and re-signing with Melbourne, {{it was predicted}} by Melbourne senior coach, Simon Goodwin, that Hogan would be a <b>key</b> <b>driver</b> behind Melbourne's potential success in 2017 due to being in a settled environment and the external pressure surrounding his contract situation diminishing. Despite being in a settled environment, Hogan suffered {{one of the toughest}} seasons on and off the field.

He returned from suspension for the Anzac Day eve match against Richmond at the MCG in round five. The death of his father, Tony Hogan, two days later due to cancer saw him miss the round six match against Essendon at Etihad Stadium. He returned the next week for the round seven match against Hawthorn, before being a late withdrawal for the match against Adelaide at the Adelaide Oval a week later due to illness. It was revealed a few days later, he had been diagnosed with testicular cancer and he was ruled out of playing for an indefinite amount of time.|$|E

2500|$|As noted, {{the process}} of ice {{formation}} and movement is a <b>key</b> <b>driver</b> in Arctic Ocean circulation {{and the formation of}} water masses. [...] With this dependence, the Arctic Ocean experiences variations due to seasonal changes in sea ice cover. Sea ice movement is the result of wind forcing, which is related to a number of meteorological conditions that the Arctic experiences throughout the year. [...] For example, the Beaufort High—an extension of the Siberian High system—is a pressure system that drives the anticyclonic motion of the Beaufort Gyre. During the summer, this area of high pressure is pushed out closer to its Siberian and Canadian sides. In addition, there is a sea level pressure (SLP) ridge over Greenland that drives strong northerly winds through the Fram Strait, facilitating ice export. In the summer, the SLP contrast is smaller, producing weaker winds. A final example of seasonal pressure system movement is the low pressure system that exists over the Nordic and Barents Seas. It is an extension of the Icelandic Low, which creates cyclonic ocean circulation in this area. The low shifts to centre over the North Pole in the summer. [...] These variations in the Arctic all contribute to ice drift reaching its weakest point during the summer months. [...] There is also evidence that the drift is associated with the phase of the Arctic Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation.|$|E
