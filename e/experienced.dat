The 2/151st Indian Infantry was one such battalion formed from one company each from the 56th Punjabi Rifles and the 51st, 52nd and 53rd Sikhs.

50|$|Mystical <b>experience</b> - Mystical <b>experiences</b> are in {{many ways}} the {{opposite}} of numinous <b>experiences.</b> In the mystical <b>experience,</b> all 'otherness' disappear and the believer becomes one with the transcendent. The believer discovers {{that he or she is}} not distinct from the cosmos, the deity or the other reality, but one with it. Zaehner has identified two distinctively different mystical experiences: natural and religious mystical <b>experiences</b> (Charlesworth: 1988). Natural mystical <b>experiences</b> are, for example, <b>experiences</b> of the 'deeper self' or <b>experiences</b> of oneness with nature. Zaehner argues that the <b>experiences</b> typical of 'natural mysticism' are quite different from the <b>experiences</b> typical of religious mysticism (Charlesworth: 1988). Natural mystical <b>experiences</b> are not considered to be religious <b>experiences</b> because they are not linked to a particular tradition, but natural mystical <b>experiences</b> are spiritual <b>experiences</b> that can have a profound effect on the individual.|$|R

50|$|In Chapter 2, The Need of a Theory of <b>Experience,</b> Dewey {{argues that}} not all <b>experiences</b> are educative and that, in fact, some <b>experiences</b> can be mis-educative. The central {{challenge}} to experience-based learning is to create fruitful <b>experiences</b> and organize them in progression to guide students’ learning. A mis-educative <b>experience</b> stymies the growth of further <b>experiences.</b> Enjoyable <b>experiences</b> may be mis-educative if they are disconnected and promote dispersive, disintegrated and centrifugal habits. In traditional schools, people associated boredom with the learning process. The <b>experiences</b> had by teachers and students were of the “wrong kind.” It Is not the absence of <b>experiences</b> in traditional schooling that Dewey finds troubling, but the defective nature of these <b>experiences.</b> Therefore, the educator’s duty {{is to determine the}} quality of an <b>experience.</b> Each <b>experience</b> has two aspects: the immediate agreeableness or disagreeableness and its later impact on further <b>experience.</b> Educators must think about the experiential continuum—continuity of <b>experiences.</b>|$|R

For this study, the concepts and characteristics of corporate brand <b>experience</b> space and <b>experience</b> design were defined, and design application plans were extracted through a case analysis. The spatial range of this study targeted Hyundai Motor Studio, Kakao Friends Shop and Line Friends Store where are indirect marketing spaces where have been built for the recent 3 years and brand <b>experience</b> spaces that belong to consumption spaces. The study results were extracted from this process. First, Hyundai Motor Studio had the biggest number of <b>experience</b> design characteristics, and {{it was followed by}} Line Friends Store and Kakao Friends Shop. When <b>experience</b> design characteristics were analyzed, an aesthetic <b>experience</b> element had the biggest intensity of <b>experience</b> design characteristics, and it was followed by an entertainment <b>experience</b> element, an escapism <b>experience</b> element and an educational <b>experience</b> element.
