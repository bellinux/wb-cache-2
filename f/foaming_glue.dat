50|$|The {{aircraft}} has unusual construction. The fuselage pod is {{made from}} gas tungsten arc welded aluminum tubing and composite, attached to a partially double-sleeved aluminum irrigation pipe. Its 31 ft span wing is constructed from wood, with foam ribs and one third span ailerons. The V-tail is all-flying and {{is made from}} <b>foam</b> ribs <b>glued</b> to the aluminum tubular spar. The flying surfaces are covered in either Mylar or doped aircraft fabric covering. On early models the control system is two-axis, all controlled by the control stick, while later ones incorporate rudder pedals.|$|R

50|$|Like {{many other}} liquid halocarbons, 1-bromopropane finds {{use as a}} liquid or gaseous solvent. It is a solvent for {{adhesives}} in aerosol <b>glues</b> that <b>glue</b> <b>foam</b> cushions together.

40|$|Nonlinear {{viscoelastic}} {{behavior is}} {{a characteristic of}} many engineering materials and also biological tissue, yet it is diffi-cult to develop dynamic models of systems that include these materials {{and are able to}} predict system behavior over a wide range of excitations. This research is focused on a specific exam-ple system {{in the form of a}} pinned-pinned beam interacting with polyurethane foam. Two cases are considered: (1) the beam and <b>foam</b> are <b>glued</b> so that they are always in contact and the foam can undergo both stretching and compression, and (2) the beam and <b>foam</b> are not <b>glued</b> so that the contact region changes with beam motion, and the foam only reacts in compression. Static as well as dynamic forces act on the beam and the Galerkin method is used to derive modal amplitude equations for the beam on polyurethane foundation. In the second case, determination of the loss of contact points is integrated into the solution proce-dure through a constraint relation. The static responses for both cases are examined as a function of the foam nonlinearity and loading conditions, and three and five mode solutions are com-pared. The steady state response of the system subject to static and harmonic loads is studied by using numerical integration techniques. Numerical challenges and the accuracy of this ap-proach are discussed. Frequency responses are generated for a range of foam nonlinearities and loading conditions. ∗Address all correspondence to this author...|$|R

40|$|Airborne {{particles}} {{smaller than}} 1 µm {{are able to}} penetrate into the alveolar region of the human lung. These types of particles are generated in large amounts during production and thermal degradation of polymers. The particles can carry reactive organic compounds, which then may deposit in the airways. Polyurethane (PUR) is a polymer widely used in the modern society for production of paints, soft and rigid <b>foam,</b> elastomers, <b>glues</b> and several other products. During production or degradation of this polymer, isocyanates, known to cause negative health effects like occupational asthma, are generated. A large amount of the isocyanates generated are associated with small particles. Isocyanates are highly reactive chemicals, in fact, during air sampling {{it is necessary to}} derivatize the isocyanates immediately upon collection, otherwise they will be lost in reactions with other compounds collected. Inhalation of isocyanate aerosols is regarded as a serious threat to human health, and the occupational exposure limits used today are amon...|$|R
50|$|Once a core {{is decided}} upon, {{a layer of}} <b>foam</b> padding is <b>glued</b> around it.

The general convention of most modern groups is {{that there must be}} at least one layer of stiff closed-cell foam for safety reasons. Some groups differ on the thickness required and this mainly stems from issues of safety and control. Some full-contact groups require more padding on striking surfaces.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{intention of}} the instrument was to appeal to upright bass players. The original Jazz Bass had two stacked knob pots with volume and tone control for each pickup. Original instruments with this stacked configuration are highly valued in the vintage guitar market. In late 1961 it received three control knobs: two controlling the volume of each pickup and one the overall tone. Despite this new feature, many stacked knob models were made until about 1962. Another feature the initial models had were the [...] "Spring Felt Mutes", which were present on basses from 1960 until 1962. The purpose of those mutes was to dampen the overtones and the sustain, and were screwed in place between the bridge and aft pickup. Those felt mutes were not a tremendous success, and were replaced by a cheaper, more simple <b>foam</b> mute <b>glued</b> underneath the bridge cover as {{was used by the}} Precision Bass from 1963 onwards. Over the following years as the use of mutes gradually declined both the Precision and Jazz Bass models eventually began to be produced without bridge/tailpiece covers.|$|R

50|$|In {{contrast}} to the more common forms of sledding, back country sledding involves four important elements in combination: {{a great amount of}} directional control, flotation, a binding system, and padding. First, back country sleds are made of strong plastic material, with the snow-side surface possessing various grooves and chines for directional control. Second, the plastic construction, with a large amount of snow-side surface area keeps the sled afloat in deeper snow conditions (the same principle behind wider powder skis or snowboards). Though the original runner sleds possessed directional control, their thin runner blades bogged down in anything but icy or thin snow conditions. Disk sleds, on the other hand, possessed floatation but no directional control. Third, modern back country sleds have a binding system, which usually consists of a simple belt strap that attaches to the sides of the sled. With the sledder in the kneeling position, the strap may go over the sledder's thighs or calves before connecting with the strap {{from the other side of}} the sled with some sort of buckling device. Finally, back country sleds have <b>foam</b> pads <b>glued</b> for the sledder to kneel on for shock absorption. One such sled is the Mad River Rocket.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe paper aims {{to combine}} two {{objectives}} of the Force Analysis Technique (FAT) : vibration source identification and material characterization from {{the same set of}} measurement. Initially, the FAT was developed for external load location and identification. It consists in injecting measured vibration displacements in the discretized equation of motion. Two developments exist: FAT and CFAT (Corrected Force Analysis Technique) where two finite difference schemes are used. Recently, the FAT was adapted for the identification of elastic and damping properties in a structure. The principal interests are: the identification is local and allows mapping of material characteristics, the identification can be made at all frequencies, especially in medium and high frequency domains. The paper recalls the development of FAT and CFAT on beams and plates and how it can be possible to extract material characteristics in areas where no external loads are applied. Experimental validations are shown on an aluminum plate with arbitrary boundary conditions, excited by a point force and where a piece of <b>foam</b> is <b>glued</b> on a sub-surface of the plate. Contact-less measurements were made using a scanning laser vibrometer. The results of FAT and CFAT are compared and discussed for material properties identifications in the regions with and without foam. The excitation force identification is finally made by using the identified material properties. CFAT gives excellent results compara-bles to a direct measurement obtained by a piezoelectric sensor. The relevance of the corrected scheme is then underlined for both source identification and material characterization from the same measurements...|$|R
5000|$|Extended {{occupational}} exposure to 1-bromopropane in higher concentrations than recommended {{has resulted in}} significant injury to workers in the United States. Its use as a solvent in aerosol glues used to <b>glue</b> <b>foam</b> cushions has been especially controversial. Reported symptoms of overexposure affect the nervous system and include confusion, slurred speech, dizziness, paresthesias, and difficulty walking, unusual fatigue and headaches, development of arthralgias, visual disturbances (difficulty focusing), and muscle twitching. Symptoms may persist over one year. Other symptoms include irritation of mucous membranes, eyes, upper respiratory tract, and skin, as well as transient loss of consciousness. Loss of feeling in the feet, an example of paresthesia, is colloquially called [...] "dead foot" [...] by workers who suffer from it. Of nationwide [...] "more than 140 cushion workers nationwide, mostly from plants in Utah, Mississippi and North Carolina,... that {{had been exposed to}} dangerous levels of the chemical, many of them sickened and are unable to walk". One worker's long-term exposure resulting in neurological damage was covered in the NY Times. Air sampling for the level of 1-bromopropane and monitoring workers' urine for metabolites are both effective at measuring workers' exposure.|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. In this study, {{two different types of}} open-cell aluminium foam samples were experimentally tested: pure metal foam fixed to a substrate (a ‘conventional’ foam heat sink) and a finned foam heat sinks (where fins are inserted in the foam to increase the effective thermal conductivity). Samples with 5, 8 and 11 fins are tested. The substrate and fins are connected to the <b>foam</b> by epoxy <b>glue</b> (k = 0. 55 W/mK). 10 PPI (Pores Per linear Inch) AL 1050 foam is used with a porosity of 93 %. The dimensions of the substrate are the same for all samples: 102 x 165 mm². Temperatures of the substrate range from 50 to 90 °C. Next to studying the thermal performance in a horizontal orientation, some samples are also tested vertically. Furthermore, the impact of radiative heat transfer is investigated. The ‘conventional’ foam heat sink performs best when comparing all foam samples: this is because of the increase in flow resistance in case of finned foam heat sinks. The thermal performance (heat transfer rate) of the ‘conventional’ foam heat sink is up to 15 % higher compared to the worst performing finned heat sink with 11 fins. Effects of the inclination angle are (only) found to be significant for the ‘conventional’ foam heat sink (up to 15 % in heat transfer rate) and painting the foam heat sink results in an increase in thermal performance up to 10. 8 %. cf 201...|$|R
40|$|LOST CHANNELS Josh Johnson, M. F. A University of Nebraska, 2010 Adviser: Mo Neal 	My current {{body of work}} {{derives from}} notions of an inward nature. Things that are {{difficult}} to put your finger on for very long are my focus. Sensations as obscure as the lump in the pit of your stomach or the itch {{in the back of your}} mind that turns sleep into a game, conditions that both stifle and propel an individual. These hazy passengers churn within, coating themselves with the residue of memories, concerns, desires and other intangible features of the body; waiting to be released from their internal home. 	Through the process and repetition of working, these arcane entities reveal themselves like overturned stones in a plowed field. I allow these unnamed sensations to influence my formal considerations and impact the psychological tone of my sculptures. In most instances, I reference forms of the natural world and ordinary objects, but then blur their identities causing them to flicker between something recognizable and something alien. This approach enables me to work with the essential qualities of that which is faceless and abstract residing within myself. 	Coupled with this direction is the motivation to employ conventional materials in an unconventional fashion. Materials that in their usual context are hidden from sight or intended to be ignored, are made visible and prominent. In this case, I am working exclusively with pink polystyrene, expanding <b>foam,</b> and white <b>glue.</b> Polystyrene <b>foam</b> is used as insulation in construction, lying buried, out of sight in the walls and ceilings of our homes. In most applications when operating in sculpture, it is covered with another material, creating mass and acting as an invisible core. Expanding foam has a similar existence, dwelling in cracks around industrial and domestic fixtures filling gaps and holes, not creating them. Likewise, white glue is commonly witnessed peering out from between the materials it holds in place and is rarely permitted to run and drip freely. Together these materials, which are typically relegated to the darkness of interior spaces, are utilized for their inherent aesthetic and structural qualities while establishing a metaphor. Just as these materials are most often found within something, so too is the situation of the content. The resulting objects become manifestations of a twofold honesty, being true to materials and to myself...|$|R
