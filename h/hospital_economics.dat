Therefore, in 1889, Nutting convinced the new dean at the Teachers College at Columbia, James E. Russell, to allow nurses to partake in <b>hospital</b> <b>economics</b> and physiology courses offered at the institution. The Teachers College was the first established school of education in the country, and Nutting believed nurses going into teaching and administrative positions would vastly benefit from studies at the school. Initially, she commuted between Baltimore and New York City teaching part-time at both universities. In 1907, after enjoying great success at her position at Columbia, Nutting took on a full-time position as a professor in institutional management. This was a historical achievement, as she was the first nurse to ever assume a chair position at a university. Johns Hopkins was greatly disappointed at the loss of such a major figure in the medical world, but the school acknowledged that Nutting would continue to play a major role in Maryland. In 1910, she was awarded the role of chairman of the department of nursing and health. Dean Russell proclaimed Nutting one of [...] "the ablest men of either sex." [...] In her chairman position, Nutting configured a world-renowned program in hospital administration and nurse education. Her ideology of nursing purported a [...] "humanistic approach" [...] where nurses served the role as both medical professionals and social workers. In 1920, Nutting was recognized for all her contributions with the Adelaide Nutting Historical Collection at Teachers College, which held a massive collection of works on her longtime idol, Florence Nightingale. In 1925, she retired from her position as chair. To this day, Nutting is remembered as one of the most instrumental factors in developing the nursing program at Columbia.|$|E

The literature on <b>hospital</b> <b>economics</b> identifies many factors which can generate cost differences between hospitals a part from efficiency. These include hospital size and its range of activity, differences in patient characteristics and quality of the care. The results from the literature suggest that DRG prices should be adjusted to take into account these factors, which are not always under the control of public hospitals but which have a direct impact on their costs. In addition, the analysis of French hospital activity indicates a strong partitioning of the type of care provided between the public and private sectors, corresponding to different hospital profiles. Not taking these different profiles into account when setting DRG prices could endanger the capacity of the hospital system to provide necessary care as well as equity of access.

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the issue of whether it is {{economically}} advantageous to concentrate emergency rooms (ERs) in large hospitals. Besides identifying economies of scale of ERs, we also focus on chain economies. The latter term refers to the effects on a hospital's costs of ER patients who also need follow-up inpatient or outpatient hospital care. We show that, for each service examined, product-specific economies of scale prevail indicating that it would be beneficial for hospitals to increase ER services. However, this seems to be inconsistent with the overall diseconomies of scale for the hospital as a whole. This intuitively contradictory result is indicated as the economies of scale paradox. This scale paradox also explains why, in general, hospitals are too large. There are internal (departmental) pressures to expand certain services, such as ER, in order to benefit from the product-specific economies of scale. However, the financial burden of this expansion is borne by the hospital as a whole. The policy implications of the results are that concentrating ERs seems to be advantageous from a product-specific perspective, but is far less advantageous from the <b>hospital</b> perspective. <b>Economics</b> of Technology and Innovatio...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the utility and <b>hospital</b> <b>economics</b> of acute MPI in Swedish ED patients with suspected ACS. Methods We included 40 patients (mean age 55 ± 2 years, 50 % women) who were admitted from the ED at Lund University Hospital for chest pain suspicious of ACS, and who had a normal or non-ischemic ECG and no previous myocardial infarction. All patients underwent MPI from the ED, and the results were analyzed only after patient discharge. The current diagnostic practice of admitting the included patients for observation and further evaluation was compared to a theoretical "MPI strategy", where patients with a normal MPI test would have been discharged home from the ED. Results Twenty-seven patients had normal MPI results, and none of them had ACS. MPI thus had a negative predictive value for ACS of 100 %. With the MPI strategy, 2 / 3 of the patients would thus have been discharged from the ED, resulting in a reduction of total hospital cost by some 270 EUR and of bed occupancy by 0. 8 days per investigated patient. Conclusion Our findings in a Swedish ED support the results of larger American trials that acute MPI has the potential to safely reduce the number of admissions and decrease overall costs for low-risk ED patients with suspected ACS. </p...|$|E
40|$|Critically ill {{patients}} often require mechanical ventilation (MV) to facilitate treatment for respiratory failure or airway protection when consciousness is impaired. Whilst the endotracheal tube (ETT) {{is an essential}} interface between the patient and ventilator, it may promote VAP by impeding host defence mechanisms and by translocating microorganisms from dental plaque to the lower airways. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which may be challenging to diagnose, is the most frequent hospital-acquired infection in critical care. It {{has been reported that}} when patients receive MV the composition of dental plaque changes to include respiratory pathogens such as Meticillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The primary aim of this research was to confirm that dental plaque communities altered during MV and to identify the potential causes of these changes. A combination of culture-based microbiology, community profiling molecular techniques and proteomic analysis of saliva was performed to analyse the microbiological content of the oral cavity, and to also quantify changes in dental plaque composition and saliva. For the first time, this study comprehensively analysed the dental plaque of mechanically ventilated patients and documented considerable species richness and diversity. Numerous potential respiratory pathogens were detected including Staphylococcus aureus, P. aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae in approximately one-third of mechanically ventilated patients. In addition, salivary flow rate was decreased and both the salivary pH and concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly elevated during intubation. Dental plaque is a reservoir for VAP, and preventing or reducing respiratory colonisation {{may play a role in}} the management of ventilated patients. Interventions to prevent colonisation could include the modulation of salivary parameters such as pH and volume and further work may lead to the identification of specific proteins that are significant.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between {{the size of a}} hospital, as measured by its average daily census, and the percentage occupancy of its beds has fascinated students in hospital planning and administration for many years. A further extension of this relationship to include the cost of operating that bed reveals the importance of this inter-connection. If, indeed, the factor of the size in small hospitals results of itself in a low percentage of occupancy and consequently, in high operating costs, then this relationship is not only fascinating but should be understood as a basic determinant of <b>hospital</b> <b>economics.</b> One of the first major discussions of this relationship appeared in Hospital Care In The United States where C. H. Hamilton not only isolated and described the occurrence of lower occupancy in smaller hospitals but advanced a theory to explain it. ' When Dr. Hamilton stated, "Both statistical theory and study of individual hospital data indicate that the extreme limit of occupied beds will not be greater or less than the average daily census plus or minus approximately four times the square root of the average daily census, " he assumed the year's daily census followed a Poisson distribution. This inference can be drawn even though it was stated that "the daily number of beds occupied will follow the normal curve. " The reason for this inference is that for a Poisson distribution the mean is equal to the variance and since the square root of the variance is the standard deviation, the above formula puts the limits of occupancy at four standard deviations from the average daily census. In accepting the Poisson distribution of daily census, we are accepting a whole series of suppositions but weakly demonstrated by the Commissio...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{infection control}} practice in Scottish {{hospitals in the}} early years of the ‘antibiotic era’, from approximately 1928 to 1970. Hospital infection and its control has, in recent years, received increasing attention from historians. But there is a notable absence of work uncovering the details of infection control practice, particularly in Scottish institutions in the 20 th century. Thus, this thesis provides a comprehensive study of practice, influenced by Erwin Ackerknecht’s behaviourist predication. Using case studies, it explores how concerns about infection and its control were manifest in the daily work of clinicians, nurses and bacteriologists, over an especially important 42 -year period, at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary and the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. This study utilises an extensive range of sources. These include, but are not limited to: hospital administrative records, ward journals, case notes, films, architectural plans, lecture notes, medical textbooks, correspondence and the medical literature. It also draws on oral history interviews, using both existing collections and carrying out new interviews. Infection control practices between 1928 and 1970 were constantly evolving, adapting and refined. Concerns about infection and its control were generally of paramount importance to clinicians, nurses and bacteriologists, although, for a brief period after about 1948, some clinicians developed relatively lax attitudes towards infection in light of the increasing popularity of antibiotics. In the years before antibiotics, a multitude of methods were adopted to control or prevent hospital-acquired infections. These infections were manifest in numerous forms, from burns infections to post-operative tetanus. Sulphonamides represented a modest advance over other, more traditional treatments. When penicillin appeared during WWII, it prompted numerous investigations into its cultivation and possible uses, and it found an important application in treating a vast range of conditions, from wound infections to burns and osteomyelitis. Penicillin was deployed in various ways and, in Glasgow, new aseptic techniques were introduced to complement it. Preparing and administering penicillin became an important part of routine nursing work, work which was, in many ways, imperative to infection control. But the drug’s shortcomings – of which bacterial resistance was one – were evident from the beginning. After 1948, antibiotics became the mainstay of hospital infection control and the methods by which they were used became increasingly diverse. For a short while, for some clinicians, infection and its control represented less of a problem than before. But growing infection rates in the 1950 s, particularly late in that decade, prompted renewed enthusiasm ii for new methods for its control. Antibiotics were gradually used with greater restraint. Laboratory work expanded into new areas and the work of new infection control committees and new sterilisation procedures led to heightened standards of asepsis in the clinic. Changes in the education and daily work of nurses also had important implications for infection control. This thesis also adds new perspectives to debates within the historiography of hospital infection and its control and within the wider medico-historical literature. In the years from 1928 to 1970, methods of control became increasingly uniform not only between hospitals, but also within hospitals. This was especially the case from the late 1950 s, owing largely to the work of new infection control committees and new systems for sterile supply. Hospital bacteriologists gradually became authorities on infection control, but they had been important at the beginning of the period and had influenced methods for infection management, in both the laboratory and the clinic, throughout the period. Largely in connection with infection control, the daily work of nurses and perceptions of their work changed considerably and generally for the better. Changes in nurse education and a reconfiguration of their daily duties allowed nurses to carry out increasingly stringent aseptic techniques. This contributed to changing perceptions of their work and expertise. Senior nurses played key roles on infection control committees and in central sterile supply facilities, influencing how infection control was practised on the ground level. There is a strong relationship between strategies for infection control and <b>hospital</b> <b>economics.</b> Supply issues and, in later years, concerns about hospital expenditure both exerted a great influence on methods for infection control and vice versa, and they often influenced the success of those methods. 20 th-century military conflict led to positive progress in infection control. Both World Wars and, to a lesser degree, military cooperation following the Suez Crisis, provided the impetus for new anti-infection treatments and techniques which still found application in peacetime. WWII also provided opportunities, not least for bacteriologists, for important clinical research. The founding of the NHS in 1948 greatly influenced the landscape of hospital infection and its control. The increasing demand for hospital care and pressures on infrastructure largely explain the growing rates of infection {{in the early years}} of the new service, while these pressures also influenced the shape that new strategies for infection control took...|$|E
40|$|Recent seminal {{developments}} in organization economics, namely the decision rights approach, offer {{an opportunity to}} shed new light on an old question, the design of effective institutions. Drawing on conclusions about how and why firm organizational boundaries change, the decision rights approach is used in this paper as an analytical lens {{to develop a new}} method for assessing institutional and incentive design in restructured hospitals. The paper explains the decision rights approach and shows how the Decision Rights Framework developed from it, is a way of mapping of incentive structures to allow a comparative assessment of institutional design, an understudied area, as most work on hospitals has focused on assessing equity vs. efficiency tradeoffs. The new method is illustrated drawing on one example from a case study of an innovative self-corporatized hospital in Lebanon that was at the vanguard of hospital restructuring legislation adopted for system-wide reforms. A country with a strong private sector tradition, Lebanon was fertile territory for analyzing how high-powered incentive schemes emerge from a public sector setting {{in a manner similar to}} the evolution of a firm in reaction to market forces. Among the findings is that key to good design is the identification of requisite incentives and the matching up of incentives with goals through decision rights allocations.

40|$|Abstract The {{study is}} a {{systematic}} empirical analysis to test some hypotheses. The objectives were (1) to analyze the sufficiency of government subsidy for poor people {{to cover the cost}} of hospital care for the hospital to reach cost recovery, and (2) to test whether economic theories can be used to analyze factors affecting the sales volume of product/service of public general hospital. Population studied were 35 general hospitals owned by district governments in Central Java. From each hospital four year time series data were taken (pooling method), so that there were 140 observations (at the end there were only 136 observations, since four observations could not be done due to incompleteness of the hospital records). Analysis of government subsidy for poor community showed that the subsidy could only cover 5 % of the hospital's yearly deficit (total yearly deficit is Rp. 1. 5 billions in average). Meanwhile, correlation analysis revealed that only two variables having significance and strong correlation with sales volume of hospital's product/service, i. e. incidence of disease and spending for social marketing. Other variables had no correlation with sales volume of product/service, or the correlations were very weak. Multivariate analysis showed that only incidence of disease, consumer's income, geographic condition, and coverage of insurance, represented in a regression model, were affecting sales volume of hospital's product/service. Results of the study confirmed that neoclassic economics theories are not suitable to analyze problems faced by government owned general hospitals. Sales volume of product/service of public general hospital was more determined by incidence of disease and consumer 'smotivation created by providers, especially physicians, not by variables regarded as dominant by neoclassic economics theories. The motivation was likely created through abuse of agency relationship which produces supplier-induced demand   Keyword: Health services for the poor, <b>Hospital</b> management, Health <b>economics</b> </p...|$|R

A Data Construction A. 1 National GME Census The American Medical Association (AMA) and the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) jointly conduct an annual National Graduate Medical Education Census (GME Track) of all residency programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). There are two main components of the census: the program survey and the sponsoring institution survey. The program survey, which is completed by the program directors, also gathers information about the residents training at the programs. Fields from the surveys are used to update FRIEDA Online, a publicly accessible database, and the AMA physician master-file. Since 2000, the GME Track has been pre-augmented with data from the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) and the National Residency Matching Program (NRMP). 1 The AMA provided records from the National GME census on all family medicine residency training programs in the Unites States between 2003 - 2004 and 2010 - 2011. The 2011 - 2012 data was provided after the initial empirical analysis was completed. The data files and identifiers are structured as follows: 1.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of organisms that cause healthcare acquired infections (HAI) puts extra stress on hospitals already struggling with rising costs and demands for greater productivity and cost containment. Infection control can save scarce resources, lives, {{and possibly a}} facility’s reputation, but statistics and epidemiology are not always sufficient {{to make the case}} for the added expense. Economics and Preventing Healthcare Acquired Infection presents a rigorous analytic framework for dealing with this increasingly serious problem. [...] - Engagingly written for the economics non-specialist, and brimming with tables, charts, and case examples, the book lays out the concepts of economic analysis in clear, real-world terms so that infection control professionals or infection preventionists will gain competence in developing analyses of their own, and be confident in the arguments they present to decision-makers. The authors: [...] - Ground the reader in the basic principles and language of economics. [...] - Explain the role of health economists in general and in terms of infection prevention and control. [...] - Introduce the concept of economic appraisal, showing how to frame the problem, evaluate and use data, and account for uncertainty. [...] - Review methods of estimating and interpreting the costs and health benefits of HAI control programs and prevention methods. [...] - Walk the reader through a published economic appraisal of an infection reduction program. [...] - Identify current and emerging applications of economics in infection control. [...] Economics and Preventing Healthcare Acquired Infection is a unique resource for practitioners and researchers in infection prevention, control and healthcare economics. It offers valuable alternate perspective for professionals in health services research, healthcare epidemiology, healthcare management, and hospital administration.

The analyzed hypothesis is that of subcutaneous therapies would provide a superior safety benefit over intravenous therapies through fixed-dose administrations, when analyzed with trastuzumab and rituximab. Methods: For the calculation of risk levels, the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis approach was applied. Within this approach, the critical treatment path is followed and risk classification for each individual step is estimated. For oncology and hematology administration, 35 different risk steps were assessed. The study was executed in 17 hematology and 16 breast cancer centers in Italy. As intravenous and subcutaneous were the only injection routes in medical available for trastuzumab and rituximab in oncology {{at the time of}} the study, these two therapies were chosen. Results: When the risk classes were calculated, eight high-risk areas were identified for the administration of an intravenous therapy in hematology or oncology; 13 areas would be defined as having a median-risk classification and 14 areas as having a low-risk classification (total risk areas: n= 35). When the new subcutaneous formulation would be applied, 23 different risk levels could be completely eliminated (65 % reduction). Important high-risk classes such as dose calculation, preparation and package labeling, preparation of the access to the vein, pump infusion preparation, and infusion monitoring were included in the eliminations. The overall risk level for the intravenous administration was estimated to be 756 (ex-ante) and could be reduced by 70 % (ex-post). The potential harm compensation for errors related to pharmacy would be decreased from eight risk classes to only three risk classes. Conclusion: The subcutaneous administration of trastuzumab (breast cancer) and rituximab (hematology) might lower the risk of administration and treatment errors for patients and could hence indirectly have a positive financial impact for <b>hospitals.</b> Keywords: health <b>economics,</b> safety, insurance premium, oncology, intravenous therapy, subcutaneous therap...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{prospective}} method of paying hospitals when the within-DRG variance is high. To avoid patients dumping, an outlier payment system is implemented. In the APDRG Swiss System, it consists {{in a mixture}} of fully prospective payments for low costs patients and partially cost-based system for high cost patients. We show how the optimal policy depends on the degree to which hospitals take patients' interest into account. A fixed-price policy is optimal when the hospital is sufficiently benevolent. When the hospital is weakly benevolent, a mixed policy solving a trade-off between rent extraction, efficiency and dumping deterrence must be preferred. Following Mougeot and Naegelen (2008), we show how the optimal combination of fixed price and partially costbased payment depends on the degree of benevolence of the hospital, the social cost of public funds and the distribution of patients severity.

Brieger, J. Lehr, H. A. Mann, W. J. info:eu-repo/semantics/article article 2005 American Journal of Rhinology 1917 - 13 <![CDATA[BACKGROUND: The exact etiologic mechanisms leading to the formation of nasal polyps have remained largely obscure. A key phenomenon of this specific type of chronic inflammatory disease in nasal respiratory mucosa is remarkable edema. Vascular permeability/vascular endothelial growth factor (VPF/VEGF) {{plays an important role in}} inducing angiogenesis and modulating capillary permeability. OBJECTIVE: To study the expression and localization of VPF/ VEGF as a putative key factor in nasal polyp development. METHODS: Specimens of nasal polyps (n = 12) were harvested during endonasal sinus surgery in patients with polypous chronic rhinosinusitis. Specimens of healthy nasal respiratory mucosa (n = 12) served as controls and were obtained from inferior turbinates of patients undergoing surgery for nasal obstruction without signs and symptoms of inflammatory disease. Frozen sections were immunohistochemically stained for VPF/VEGF and quantitatively analyzed, using computer-based image analysis. RESULTS: The expression of VPF/VEGF in specimens of nasal polyps was significantly stronger than in specimens of healthy nasal mucosa of controls. VPF/VEGF in polypous tissue was mainly localized in vascular endothelial cells, in basal membranes and perivascular spaces, and in epithelial cells. CONCLUSION: The markedly increased expression in nasal polyps as opposed to healthy nasal mucosa suggests that VPF/VEGF may play a significant role in both the formation of nasal polyps and in the induction of heavy tissue edema. This finding is discussed with respect to the differential expression of cyclooxygenase (COX) isoenzymes- 1 and - 2 (COX- 1 and COX- 2) in nasal polyps was significantly stronger than in specimens of healthy nasal mucosa of controls.
