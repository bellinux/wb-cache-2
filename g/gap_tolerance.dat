40|$|Joints {{intended}} for welding frequently show variations in geometry and position, {{for which it}} is unfortunately not possible to apply a single set of operating parameters to ensure constant quality. The cause of this difficulty lies in a number of factors, including inaccurate joint preparation and joint fit up, tack welds, as well as thermal distortion of the workpiece. In plasma arc keyhole welding of butt joints, deviations in the gap width may cause weld defects such as an incomplete weld bead, excessive penetration and burn through. Manual adjustment of welding parameters to compensate for variations in the gap width is very difficult, and unsatisfactory weld quality is often obtained. In this study a control system for plasma arc keyhole welding has been developed and used to study the effects of the real time control of welding parameters on <b>gap</b> <b>tolerance</b> during welding of austenitic stainless steel AISI 304 L. The welding tests demonstrated the beneficial effect of real time control on weld quality. Compared with welding using constant parameters, the maximum tolerable gap width with an acceptable weld quality was 47 % higher when using the real time controlled parameters for a plate thickness of 5 mm. In addition, burn through occurred with significantly larger gap widths when parameters were controlled in real time. Increased <b>gap</b> <b>tolerance</b> enables joints to be prepared and fit up less accurately, saving time and preparation costs for welding. In addition to the control system, a novel technique for back face monitoring is described in this study.

40|$|The need {{to provide}} passage and {{protective}} screens at irrigation diversions {{has always been a}} necessary part of the Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program (NPPC 1984, 1987, 1994). From 1985 through 1990, fish protection facilities in large irrigation diversions throughout the Columbia Basin, especially in the Yakima Basin, were updated. After 1990, fish protection efforts turned to installation of new facilities on unscreened diversions and to repair and upgrade of older facilities. The screening program also includes funds to monitor and evaluate the facilities. The screen evaluations indicate they are an effective means for protecting juvenile fish larger than 40 mm in length. As state and federal agencies change screening criteria to protect smaller fish (e. g., bull trout fry), the physical barrier may not always be effective. Screen mesh small enough to protect fish may be vulnerable to frequent plugging. <b>Gap</b> <b>tolerances</b> on side and bottom seals may be difficult to install and maintain. Physical barrier screens can be enhanced with behavioral barriers that cause fish to avoid a hazard. Behavioral barriers may consist of sound generator, strobe lights, bubble curtains, or electrical barriers. State of Oregon House Bill 3112 states that "Standards and criteria shall address the overall level of protection necessary at a given water diversion and shall not favor one technology or technique over another. " Additionally, it goes on to say, "Screening device means a fish screen or behavior barrier. " Other Northwest states, in particular Washington, have taken a comprehensive program to install barriers at all unscreened diversions by 1999. Protecting all fish at all water withdrawals will probably require both physical and behavioral barriers.

St. Jude Medical (SJM) provided four transparent mitral BMHVs: one 23 mm CarboMedics (CM), one 27 mm SJM Standard and two 27 mm prototype BHMVs with altered hinge gap widths. Aortech Inc. provided three 23 mm aortic prototype TPHVs. Laser Doppler velocimetry and Particle Image velocimetry were used to measure flow velocity inside these valve prostheses. The flows through the valves were maintained within physiological limits. All valves revealed Reynolds shear stress (RSS) levels greater than 200 Pa far exceeding the threshold for platelet activation and hemolysis. MHV hinge flows in the mitral position were characterized by a strong recirculation during ventricular diastole while leakage jets over and adjacent to leaflets were prominent during ventricular systole. CM hinge flow had higher RSS than in the SJM hinge. The large gap width hinge had the largest leakage jet size and highest RSS (> 400 Pa) during ventricular diastole. The Standard gap width hinge showed better washout during systole and provided optimum hemodynamic performance than the prototype designs. In aortic prototype PHVs, elevated RSS conducive to hemolysis was observed along the central jet during systole and the leakage jet at the high central region inside the valve during diastole.
