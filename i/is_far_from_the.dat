5|$|Larry Wilmore, {{who plays}} the {{sensitivity}} trainer Mr. Brown, is {{a writer for the}} show. At the table-read for this episode, they had not cast the part yet and Daniels had Wilmore read for the role to fill in. After the read, producer Greg Daniels thought he was perfect for the role. However, because of stipulations with the Screen Actors Guild, producers still had to have Wilmore formally audition with other actors for the role. Daniels was also not sure where to use Mindy Kaling on screen in the series until the point came in this episode's script when Michael needed to be slapped by a minority.

5|$|A former colonial marshal on the {{backwater}} {{planet of}} Mar Sara, Raynor joins Arcturus Mengsk's revolutionaries in their {{fight against the}} tyrannical and corrupt Confederacy of Man, where he develops a relationship with Sarah Kerrigan, Mengsk's second in command. However, he quickly comes to realise that Mengsk <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> force for good when he abandons Kerrigan and {{the entire population of}} a planet to die by the hand of the Zerg to satisfy his own thirst for power. Disillusioned and embittered, Raynor deserts Mengsk and becomes a persona non grata in the new Terran Dominion. The situation gets no better when Kerrigan, who was captured by the Zerg, is assimilated into the swarm and becomes one of their most powerful assets. After desertion, Raynor and his forces take part in major combat operations across the sector: He fights alongside the Protoss templar Tassadar in the battle that leads to the fall of the Zerg ruler, the Overmind, and splinters the Zerg into several factions. When the expeditionary forces of United Earth Directorate (UED) arrive in the sector to subjugate it, Raynor, Mengsk and Kerrigan (now calling herself the Queen of Blades) combine their Terran, Zerg and Protoss allies to repel the invasion. No sooner than they fall, the alliance shatters.|$|E

25|$|In {{coherent}} sheaf theory, {{pushing to}} the limit {{of what could be}} done with Serre duality without the assumption of a non-singular scheme, the need to take a whole complex of sheaves in place of a single dualizing sheaf became apparent. In fact the Cohen–Macaulay ring condition, a weakening of non-singularity, corresponds to the existence of a single dualizing sheaf; and this <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> general case. From the top-down intellectual position, always assumed by Grothendieck, this signified a need to reformulate. With it came the idea that the 'real' tensor product and Hom functors would be those existing on the derived level; with respect to those, Tor and Ext become more like computational devices.|$|E

Irish Wolfhounds are often favored for their loyalty, affection, {{patience}} and devotion. Although at some points in history they have been used as watchdogs, unlike some breeds, the Irish Wolfhound is usually unreliable in this role as they are often friendly toward strangers, although their size can be a natural deterrent. However, when protection is required this dog is never found wanting. When they or their family are in any perceived danger they display a fearless nature. Author and Irish Wolfhound breeder Linda Glover believes the dogs' close affinity with humans makes them acutely aware and sensitive to ill will or malicious intentions leading to their excelling as a guardian rather than guard dog.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, {{the effect}} of varying substituents on the {{catalyst}} is rarely well understood. Small substituent changes can completely change reactivity or selectivity. An example of {{this was in the}} optimization studies of a bifunctional Strecker reaction catalyst, one of the first well-studied thiourea catalysts. Specifically, varying the X substituent on the salicylaldimine substituent, it was found that typical electron-withdrawing or electron-donating substituents had little effect on the rate, but ester substituents such as acetate or pivaloate seemed to cause noticeable rate acceleration. This observation is difficult to rationalize given that the X group <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> reactive center {{during the course of the}} reaction and electronics do not seem to be the cause. In general, despite the relative ease of electronic tuning with organic catalysts, chemists have not yet reached a useful understanding of these modifications.|$|E
25|$|The above formula {{assumes that}} the source is either {{directly}} approaching or receding from the observer. If the source approaches the observer at an angle (but still with a constant velocity), the observed frequency that is first heard {{is higher than the}} object's emitted frequency. Thereafter, there is a monotonic decrease in the observed frequency as it gets closer to the observer, through equality when it is coming from a direction perpendicular to the relative motion (and was emitted at the point of closest approach; but when the wave is received, the source and observer will no longer be at their closest), and a continued monotonic decrease as it recedes from the observer. When the observer is very close to the path of the object, the transition from high to low frequency is very abrupt. When the observer <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> path of the object, the transition from high to low frequency is gradual.|$|E
25|$|The {{kidnapping}} problems, however, {{have been}} replaced with violence related to the drug trade, {{despite the fact that}} Morelos <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> U.S. border. The 2009 slaying of kingpin Arturo Beltrán Leyva set of a turf war for his successor. It has increased the number of gun battles and gangland-style executions. Anonymous email threats succeed in keeping people away from Cuernavaca at night, with bars and nightclubs closing when such communications threaten drug violence. In 2004, Governor Sergio Estrada ordered the mass firing of all of the state police officers after top police commanders were arrested on charges that they were working with drug traffickers. This caused a major political battle for the governor, who then himself was accused of coperating with drug rings, with attempts to take him out of office. The area around Lagunas de Zempoala National Park, on Morelos's border with Mexico City, is one of Mexico's 16 most dangerous regions, in part due to the narcotics trade.|$|E

25|$|The proneural protein Atonal (Ato) is {{responsible}} for the development of Drosophila’s R8 photoreceptors. However, it does not act alone, since it dimerizes with a second identical protein, ‘’Daughterless (Da)’’ that reinforces its expression. The coexpression of ‘’Ato’’ and ‘’Da’’ is important for the migration of the different cell types of an ommatidium and for the repression of atonal in the inter-cluster spaces, functioning as inhibitory signals that regulate both the number and position of the nascent R8 cells. Moreover, this expression leads to the activation of the kinase MAPK that is important for the cellular recruitment and the repressor effect, once, when this kinase is inactive the expression of ‘’Ato’’ is detected in every cell. In an initial state, Hedgehog (‘’Hh’’) and Decapentaplegic are responsible for the activation of ‘’ato’’ in small cellular clusters, leading to the activation of MAPK. First, Hedgehog induces ‘’ato’’ expression in more than just the cells that ultimately become photoreceptor cells, so its expression has to be refined and restricted to a single presumptive R8 cell. Hedgehog signaling is also required to repress ‘’atonal’’ expression between the nascent proneural clusters, which reveals a dual role crucial to building precision and geometry into the adult retina. Therefore, the regulation of ‘’ato’’ expression depends on the levels of Hedgehog: at low levels (that <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> source) this pronuclear gene is activated and at high levels (close to the source) it is repressed. Combining lateral inhibition with the dual role played by Hedgehog, one can imagine how the hexagonal array of R8 cells can be patterned.|$|E
25|$|Armin was one {{of three}} {{children}} born to John Armyn II of King's Lynn, a successful tailor and friend to John Lonyson, a goldsmith also of King's Lynn. His brother, John Armyn III, was a merchant tailor in London. Armin did not take up his father's craft; instead, his father apprenticed him to Lonyson in the Goldsmiths' Company in 1581. Lonyson was the Master of Works at the Royal Mint in the Tower of London, a position of great responsibility. The arrangement moved Armin to a life and a social circle quite different from what he might have expected as a Norfolk tailor. Lonyson died in 1582, and the apprenticeship was transferred to another master. According to a tale preserved in Tarlton's Jests, Armin {{came to the attention of}} the Queen's famous jester Richard Tarlton. In the course of his duties, the story contends, Armin was sent to collect money from a lodger at Tarlton's inn. Frustrated by the man's refusal to pay, Armin wrote verses in chalk on the wall; Tarlton noticed and, approving their wit, wrote an answer in which he expressed a desire to take Armin as his apprentice. Though not corroborated, this anecdote <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> least plausible in Tarlton's Jests. Influenced by Tarlton or not, Armin already had a literary reputation before he finished his apprenticeship in 1592. In 1590, his name is affixed to the preface of a religious tract, A Brief Resolution of the Right Religion. Two years later, both Thomas Nashe (in Strange News) and Gabriel Harvey (in Pierce's Supererogation) mention him as a writer of ballads; none of his work in this vein, however, is known to have survived.|$|E
