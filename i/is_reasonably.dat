5|$|As {{regards the}} first question, in Borissik v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009), the Singapore High Court adopted four {{conditions}} {{set out in}} De Smith's Judicial Review (6th ed., 2007) {{to determine whether a}} legitimate expectation has been created. The public body's representation must be clear, unambiguous and devoid of any relevant qualification; induced by the conduct of the decision-maker; made by a person with actual or ostensible authority; and applicable to the applicant, who belongs to the class of persons to whom the representation <b>is</b> <b>reasonably</b> expected to apply.|$|E

At that time, all packages in the testing branch become the new stable branch. Although freeze dates are time-based, release dates are not, which are announced by the release managers {{a couple of weeks}} beforehand.|$|E

5|$|Stela 5 <b>is</b> <b>reasonably</b> well {{preserved}} and is inscribed with two Long Count dates flanked by representations of two standing figures portraying rulers. The latest {{of these two}} dates is AD126. The right-hand figure is holding a snake, while the left-hand figure is holding what is probably a jaguar. This monument probably represents one ruler passing power to the next. A small seated figure is carved onto each of the sides of this stela along with a badly eroded hieroglyphic inscription. The style is early Maya and has affinities with sculptures at Izapa.|$|E
5|$|At {{present in}} the United States there are three {{different}} levels of scrutiny. Firstly, if a law categorizes {{on the basis of}} race or national origin (which are regarded as suspect classifications), or infringes a fundamental right, strict scrutiny is applied. Accordingly, the law is unconstitutional unless it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. In addition, there should not be a less restrictive alternative available to achieve that compelling interest. Secondly, if the law categorizes on the basis of gender, legitimacy or similar quasi-suspect classifications, intermediate scrutiny is applied – the law is unconstitutional unless it is substantially related to an important government interest. Finally, the traditional rational basis review is applied if the law categorizes on some other, non-suspect, basis. In this case, the law is constitutional so long as it <b>is</b> <b>reasonably</b> related to a legitimate government interest.|$|E
5|$|The {{skeleton}} <b>is</b> <b>reasonably</b> {{complete and}} includes a partial skull. Sauropod skull bones are rarely found, and the Amargasaurus skull {{is only the second}} skull known from a member of the Dicraeosauridae. Major parts of the skeleton were found in their original anatomical position: the vertebral column of the neck and back, which consisted of 22 articulated vertebrae, was found connected to both the skull and the sacrum. Of the skull, only the temporal region and the braincase are preserved. The sacrum, despite being partly eroded prior to burial, is fairly complete. Most of the tail is missing, with three anterior, three middle, and one posterior vertebrae being preserved, along with fragments of several others. The shoulder girdle is known from the scapula (shoulder blade) and coracoid (which sits on {{the lower end of the}} scapula), while the pelvis is merely known from the ilium (the uppermost of the three pelvic bones). The limbs are equally fragmentary, with the manus (hand) and most of the pes (foot) missing. The skeleton is currently stored in the collection of the Bernardino Rivadavia Natural Sciences Museum in Buenos Aires.|$|E

5|$|In Borissik Svetlana v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009), the {{applicant}} {{and her husband}} owned a semi-detached house which they wished to redevelop. In 2002, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) had issued a circular imposing certain restrictions on the redevelopment of semi-detached houses. The URA rejected {{the applicant}}'s redevelopment application {{on the basis of}} the circular. Counsel for the applicant argued before the High Court that the applicant had a legitimate expectation that the proposal to redevelop the house would be approved. The Court held that the URA had not acted in a way that could have led the applicant to have such a legitimate expectation. It adopted four conditions set out in De Smith's Judicial Review (6th ed., 2007) to determine whether a legitimate expectation has been created: the public body's representation must be clear, unambiguous and devoid of any relevant qualification; induced by the conduct of the decision-maker; made by a person with actual or ostensible authority; and applicable to the applicant, who belongs to the class of persons to whom the representation <b>is</b> <b>reasonably</b> expected to apply. The only legitimate expectation that could have arisen after the 2002 circular had been issued was that the URA would act in accordance with those guidelines unless the circumstances were such that an exception has to be made. The applicant in Borissik argued that she had a legitimate expectation to a substantive right, but since the Court decided that the URA had made no clear representation to her, it did not make any pronouncements on the approach that should be taken towards substantive legitimate expectations in Singapore.|$|E

50|$|Although {{judicial}} {{officers had}} to prefer interpretations {{of legislation that}} fell within constitutional bounds over those that did not, provided that such an interpretation could <b>be</b> <b>reasonably</b> ascribed to the provision, limits had {{to be placed on}} the application of that principle. On the one hand, it was the duty of a judicial officer to interpret legislation in conformity with the Constitution insofar as this <b>was</b> <b>reasonably</b> possible; on the other hand, the legislature was under a duty to pass legislation that <b>was</b> <b>reasonably</b> clear and precise, enabling citizens and officials to understand what was expected of them. A balance would often have to be struck as to how this tension was to be resolved when considering the constitutionality of legislation. There would be occasions when a judicial officer would find that the legislation, although open to a meaning which would <b>be</b> unconstitutional, <b>was</b> <b>reasonably</b> capable of being read in conformity with the Constitution. Such an interpretation should not, however, be unduly strained. Where a legislative provision <b>was</b> <b>reasonably</b> capable of a meaning that placed it within constitutional bounds, it should be preserved. Only if this was not possible should resort be had to the remedy of reading in or notional severance.|$|R
