I crystallizes in the orthorhombic crystal {{system with a}} large unit cell [Pearson symbol oP 64; Pnma, Z = 8, a = 8. 8350 (5) Å, b = 7. 1888 (3) Å, c = 20. 3880 (7) Å], whereas all other compounds are hexagonal [hP 24; P 6 ̅ 2 m, Z = 3, a = 8. 54 – 8. 77 (1) Å, c = 7. 19 – 7. 24 (1) Å]. Both structures contain mutually orthogonal layers of Au 6 hexagons in chair and boat conformations, resulting in a hexagonal diamond-like network. Ae atoms and additional (Au/Ga) 3 groups are formally encapsulated by (Au 6) 2 distorted hexagonal prisms formed of three edge-sharing hexagons in the boat conformation or, alternatively, lie between two Au 6 hexagons in the chair conformation. The (Au/Ga) 3 groups can be substituted by Ae atoms {{in some of the}} hexagonal structures with no change to the structural symmetry. Tight-binding electronic structure calculations using linear-muffin-tin-orbital methods on idealized models “BaAu 5 Ga 2 ” and “BaAu 4 Ga 3 ” show both compounds to be metallic with evident pseudogaps near the corresponding Fermi levels. The integrated crystal orbital Hamilton populations are dominated by Au–Au and Au–Ga orbital interactions, although Ba–Au and Ba–Ga contributions are significant. Furthermore, Au–Au interactions vary considerably along different directions in the unit cells, with the largest values for the hexagons in the boat conformation and the lowest values for those in the chair conformation. II revealed that partial substitution of Au atoms in the hexagonal <b>diamond</b> <b>net</b> by a post-transition element (Ga) may occur in this family, whereas the sizes of the (Au/Ga) 3 groups and strong Ba–Au covalent interactions allow for their mutual replacement in the voids...|$|E

Using either the Lace-maker or the Net-maker method to tie the netting knot, you can create several types of <b>netting.</b> <b>Diamond</b> mesh <b>netting</b> goes back and forth, in rows. This technique is used for bags, hammocks, headbands and scarves. Another type is square mesh netting which also goes back and forth in rows but is worked in the diagonal. This type of net is used for trawling.The first row starts at one corner and the last row finishes the corner diagonal to the first corner. This is often used as a foundation for lacis or net embroidery. Spiral netting is a type of netting that goes around and around in a similar manner to knitting or crochet. There’s no beginning or ending to specific rounds since the pattern is continuous and just keeps going.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to study the causes of by-catch in shrimp fishing gears in The Gambia waters and to propose measures to reduce the catch of juvenile and undersized fish. Catch and discard of undersized fish by shrimp trawlers {{is a matter of}} concern. Four methods of by-catch reduction are studied in this report including the Nordmøre grate, grid, enlarged mesh and square mesh {{in order to determine the}} most appropriate method for by-catch reduction in The Gambia waters. Square mesh was found to be the most likely method to reduce by-catch and should be applied in shrimp trawl, shrimp drift gill net and stow net fisheries in The Gambia waters. The method is simple and does no t require extra <b>netting</b> material. The <b>diamond</b> mesh <b>netting</b> of any of the gear can be turned to 90 º and the meshes mounted through the bars to attain square shape meshes.

40|$|Several {{possible}} {{relationships between}} {{natural resources and}} civil conflict have been hypothesized and tested in the literature. The impact of resources on conflict should depend on {{the circumstances of the}} group that (potential) rebels see themselves as representing and depend upon for support. While 'lootable' resources such as alluvial diamonds have been shown to increase the likelihood of insurgency, among territorially concentrated ethnic groups looting by rebels recruiting from the group is counterproductive because it imposes negative externalities on the rebel constituency. However, local mineral abundance could encourage rebellion indirectly, by promoting the development of secessionist objectives, since autonomy or independence would allow the rebel constituency to enjoy a larger share of the benefits flowing from mineral revenues. On the other hand, mineral abundance could encourage the government to exercise greater surveillance and control over potentially restive minority populations. On balance, then, mineral abundance should affect ethnoregional conflict primarily by encouraging ethnic rebels to adopt limited, territorial-autonomy objectives as opposed to governmental objectives. This hypothesis is tested with a new, global dataset of substate mineral production. Local mineral resource abundance is indeed negatively associated with governmental conflict among ethnoregional groups and positively related to secessionist or territorial conflict. Moreover, it is the total value of mineral production that matters, not specific types of minerals such as oil or <b>diamonds.</b> The <b>net</b> effect of mineral abundance on the total risk of intrastate conflict onset among ethnoregions is essentially zero. internal conflict; natural resources; secession...|$|R

The test of artificial rainfall takes the agricultural soil that is with the thickness of 10 cm and from Lugu Township of Nantou County at the altitude of 800 m as the bottom soil. Artificial materials are laid on the surface, and then, the organic soil without any adhesive with the thickness of 3 cm is sprayed on it. The testing conditions are the gradients of 15 ˚ and 45 ˚ and the rainfall intensity of 130 mm/hr. Soil erosion tests are separately conducted for 20 min on the three artificial covering materials and the laid control group. And, the trap efficiency of different materials are determined by adding homogenized sand grains with the fixed quantity into the steady launder with the gradient of 4. 5 ˚. According to the test, the nonwoven three-D netting with the light-shielding rate of 63 %, the Manning's coefficient of 0. 080 and the irregular structural type has the highest anti-erosion efficiency in the soil erosion test. The serfertnet method with the light-shielding rate of 66 %, the Manning's coefficient of 0. 163 and the regular structural type has the best efficiency in the trap test. However, both the two efficiency of the three-D iron <b>diamond</b> compound <b>netting</b> with light-shielding rate of 27 %, the Manning's coefficient of 0. 037 and regular structural type are low. As to the differences between vegetation restoration effects, this study develops the mode illustration of vegetation restoration hydrograph with the three modes of normality, slowness and fault by adopting the graph of plant growth (Lin, Hsin-Hui, 2000) and the mode illustration of ecological evolution (ODUM, 1996), and analyzes the modes by the 27 investigation points between 248. 7 K~ 386 K of the toward-north National Highway No. 3 with close construction periods.
