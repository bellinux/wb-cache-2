40|$|Much {{literature}} presents <b>employee</b> resource <b>groups</b> as {{beneficial to}} both the organizations and the employees who join these groups. Many large corporations have <b>employee</b> resource <b>groups,</b> and their presence is expanding. As companies continue to invest in <b>employee</b> resource <b>groups,</b> {{it is important to}} establish and review the business goals and expectations for the groups An environment where objectives and expectations are established and well understood creates less ambiguity for employees and allows them to focus on achieving the objectives. It is important to evaluate the objectives and expectations to see if the groups are achieving the expectations. Assessing the performance against the expectations also exposes any potential areas for modifying the objectives as the organizational needs and requirements of <b>employee</b> resource <b>group</b> changes. This will ensure the groups are aligned with the company 2 ̆ 7 s diversity strategy. The {{purpose of the study was}} to look at differences and variables between members of <b>employee</b> resource <b>groups</b> and non-members of <b>employee</b> resource <b>groups</b> at a global technology company. Specifically, the study analyzed the association of <b>employee</b> resource <b>group</b> membership on self-report employee job performance. A <b>group</b> of 315 <b>employee</b> resource <b>group</b> members and 315 non-employee resource group members responded to an online questionnaire. The company uses four dimensions to evaluate job performance, and job performance was analyzed in each dimension. Then, the sum of the four dimensions was calculated. These dimensions were used in a correlation analysis to determine whether there was a positive relationship between participation in an <b>employee</b> resource <b>group</b> and self-reported job performance. The study found that there was a positive and significant correlation between self-reported job performance and <b>employee</b> resource <b>group</b> membership. The study evaluated the extent to which <b>employee</b> resource <b>group</b> members perceived they were performing the objectives that were established for <b>employee</b> resource <b>groups</b> at a global technology company. Overall the study found that <b>employee</b> resource <b>group</b> members were achieving the objectives that the company set for them. Much research points to companies using <b>employee</b> resource <b>groups</b> to support the marketing of products or services to a targeted demographic. However, in this study that was the one area where the respondents indicated they did not have an opportunity to demonstrate this objective and the members did not positively respond that they were accomplishing this objective. This study used the validated 2 ̆ 2 Propensity to Connect (PCO) 2 ̆ 2 instrument (Totterdell, Holman 2 ̆ 6 Hukin, 2008), to examine the survey participants 2 ̆ 7 tendency to connect with others. In two prior studies the three components of PCO, which are making friends, making acquaintances, and joining others were positively associated with social groups in two prior studies. For this study a logistic regression model was used to predict <b>employee</b> resource <b>group</b> membership. Only two components, making friends and joining others, showed a significant impact on predicting group membership.. Continuing to look at variables associated with <b>employee</b> resource <b>groups,</b> the study used the validated questions on a 2 ̆ 2 Turnover Intentions 2 ̆ 2 instrument (Friedman 2 ̆ 6 Holtom, 2002), for both <b>employee</b> resource <b>group</b> members and non-employee resource group members; to explore differences in intentions to leave the company.

5000|$|The Court of Arbitration was {{the first}} court in New South Wales, a state of Australia which dealt {{exclusively}} with industrial relation disputes {{in the early twentieth}} century. Justice Lance Wright claims that it perhaps {{was the first}} court of its type in the world. [...] The court was unique at that time as it was the first court of its type to deal with labour relations between employer and employees on a compulsory basis. [...] Previous arbitration measures between employer and employee had been on a voluntary basis or had been based on the criminal justice system through the use of criminal penalties.The conventional economic model is that both employer and employee enjoy equal bargaining power to set wages and conditions. [...] This asserts that both parties are able to agree on a fair market price for the cost of labour free from distortions. However, where employers or <b>employees</b> <b>group</b> together, these outcomes can be distorted particularly in “boom” or “bust” economic conditions. The purpose of the court was to change the manner in which employers and employees negotiated pay and conditions. It was an attempt to reduce the power imbalances between employer groups or employee unions that arose from using collective bargaining, and the resulting use of that market power to influence wages, and also to reduce the threat of lockout or strikes to achieve those ends.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{makes an}} attempt to provide a broad {{overview}} of the salient aspects of the growth story of Indian Railways (IR) since independence. More specifically, the study aims to analyse the trends of output and employment for the period 1981 - 82 through 2007 - 08. The entire study period {{is divided into three}} sub-periods - Period I (1981 - 82 to 1991 - 92);PeriodII(1992 - 93 - 2002 - 03);PeriodIII(2003 - 04 to 2007 - 08). Inaddition, the study also looks at the 'turnaround' story of IR. The output of IR is categorised as freight (NTKM) and passenger (PKM) outputs. Labour is divided into three categories - skilled management personnel (group A&B), semi-skilled <b>employees</b> (<b>group</b> C) and unskilled <b>employees</b> (<b>group</b> D). The data on freight output reveal that while the average annual growth rates of NTKM declined in the second period over the first period, high average annual growth rates of freight output were registered in the third period. The rate of growth of PKMs increased over the study period across IR. The employment scenario across IR shows that the percentage share of the skilled management personnel (group A&B) remained {{more or less the same}} over the entire study period, while the percentage share of the semi-skilled labour (group C) increased from around 51 percent in the first period to nearly 63 percent in the third period. The percentage share of the unskilled labour (group D) registered a decline from the first period to the third period (from nearly 49 percent to 36 percent respectively). The rate of growth of labour productivity registered an increase in all the three periods over IR. The contribution made by the skilled management personnel to output is more when compared to the semi-skilled labour. The turnaround story tells us that the high growth rates of output and earnings on IR were made possible through the implementation of various strategies already in place.

Debates surrounding school district consolidation have been known to cause deep tension throughout many communities. It is widely held that, schools in rural areas not only provide education, but create jobs, provide entertainment, and bolster social relationships within a region.
