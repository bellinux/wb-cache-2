25|$|Ecological {{economics}} is distinguishable from neoclassical economics primarily by its {{assertion that the}} economy is embedded within an environmental system. Ecology deals with the energy and matter transactions of life and the Earth, and the human economy is by definition contained within this system. Ecological economists argue that neoclassical economics <b>has</b> <b>ignored</b> the environment, at best considering it to be a subset of the human economy.|$|E
25|$|Guatemala is {{probably}} the country where Gómez Carrillo is least known, and where the few that do know about his work, are those who criticize it the most. Official cultura curriculum <b>has</b> <b>ignored</b> him, neglecting both his persona and his work. Luis Cardoza y Aragón, the spiritual guide of the Guatemalan leftists, has been the direct culprit of this; in both of his memoirs -which have become actual bibles for his followers- Cardoza y Aragón wrote complete chapters about Gómez Carrillo where he attacks the writer mercilessly. Cardozas criticism, howewer, cannot completely hide his resentment and envy toward the writer who visited him in Paris in his youth, and to whom he dedicated his very first poems book.|$|E

The season also focuses on Lily's past betrayals coming back to haunt her; Chuck and Blair's tumultuous relationship after their break up; Dan and Vanessa's deteriorating friendship; and the arrival of Serena's cousin Charlie Rhodes (Kaylee Defer) to the Upper East Side.

25|$|The Kunbis, {{along with}} the Teli and the Mali, {{play a major role}} in the {{politics}} of the Vidharbha region of Maharashtra. The three groups compose 50% of the electorate and are known to influence election outcomes. The Kunbis, being landlords, hold the upper-hand in the politics of the region and can decide the outcome of at least 22 seats, since they are dominant in every village of the region. The Kunbis, who are known to have a more tolerant attitude and are more secular than the Telis, prefer the Congress Party. As a result, the Party has held a dominant position in the region for several decades. However, in the last decade or so, Congress <b>has</b> <b>ignored</b> the Kunbis and other parties like the Bharatiya Janata Party; Shiv Sena responded by giving more opportunities to Kunbi candidates in elections.|$|E
25|$|Paul R. Thagard used astrology as a {{case study}} to {{distinguish}} science from pseudoscience and proposed principles and criteria to delineate them. First, astrology has not progressed in that it has not been updated nor added any explanatory power since Ptolemy. Second, it <b>has</b> <b>ignored</b> outstanding problems such as the precession of equinoxes in astronomy. Third, alternative theories of personality and behavior have grown progressively to encompass explanations of phenomena which astrology statically attributes to heavenly forces. Fourth, astrologers have remained uninterested in furthering the theory to deal with outstanding problems or in critically evaluating the theory in relation to other theories. Thagard intended this criterion to be extended to areas other than astrology. He believed it would delineate as pseudoscientific such practices as witchcraft and pyramidology, while leaving physics, chemistry and biology in the realm of science. Biorhythms, which like astrology relied uncritically on birth dates, did not meet the criterion of pseudoscience at the time because there were no alternative explanations for the same observations. The use of this criterion has the consequence that a theory can be scientific at one time and pseudoscientific at a later time.|$|E

500|$|In 2005, the National Institute on Media and the Family {{criticized the}} ESRB for seldom-using the Adults Only rating {{because it has}} a vested {{interest}} in the video game industry, stating that [...] "study after study shows that ratings would be stricter if parents were doing the job. It took explicit porn to get [...] an AO rating, even though the original version, still rated M, rewards players whose on-screen persona had sex with prostitutes and then killed them.

[...] The ESRB disputed these claims, arguing that the organization [...] "relies on flawed research and ignores any and all conflicting evidence", was [...] "imposing its own narrow values and morality {{on the rest of the}} country, regardless that it has little evidence to show that parents agree with their point of view", and did not reply to the ESRB's request for comments following its report card in 2004.

[...] Small protests were organized at cathedrals in Chicago and Washington, D.C. Ms. magazine reported that Sister Donna Quinn, president of NCAN, said that the Pope's demand for obedience [...] "tramples on who we are as women religious in the United States". Ms. writer Mary Kay Blakely added that she thought Mansour was correct in saying that [...] "the Pope doesn't understand the American people, and he doesn't understand the American nun". Divided over the Mansour affair, the Catholic Theological Society of America passed an unsuccessful resolution asking for dialog rather than simple administrative decisions which [...] "violate both the theological meaning of authority in the church and the sacredness of conscience of church members".|$|E

Taylor of AllMusic stated [...] "This is a pure metal album that seemingly <b>has</b> <b>ignored</b> any fashionable trend and instead relies solely on skill and expertise to sculpt some of meatiest heavy metal since the glory days of Metallica and Slayer." [...] Taylor also expressed the impressiveness of the band's [...] "do-it-yourself" [...] work ethic as Dutkiewicz handled all production and D'Antonio [...] "took the time to give much thought on the album's packaging and art direction." [...] Dom Lawson of Kerrang! magazine gave the album five [...] "Ks" [...] (or five out of five stars). He praised the album's unique new sound, music, and vocal performances from Leach. Kevin Boyce of CMJ said, [...] "This album is more addictive than crack cocaine that's been smothered in caffeine and nicotine and drenched with chocolate. Starting with the track 'Numbered Days,' this 12-track platter never takes its foot off of the throttle."
