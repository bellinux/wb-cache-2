50|$|Conductive {{characteristics}} in coated synthetic fabrics demonstrates an energy current across a specific woven synthetic material, such energy generation in fabrics {{coated with a}} conductive polymer as found in polypyrrole. First validated by D.D.S. developer M.H.Webb, the discovery showed that when PET fabrics are coated by chemical synthesis using four different oxidizing agent-dopant combinations present an increase in energy when a <b>fixed</b> <b>source</b> {{is applied to the}} fabric. Several combinations of blends have proven to be successful in transfer, anthracenedione-2-sulfonic acid (AQSA) sodium salt doped polypyrrole coating was the most effective in generation whereas the sodium perchlorate dopant system was the least effective. The power density per unit area achieved in polypyrrole coated polyester-Lycra fabric with 0.027 mol/l of AQSA acting as dopant was 430 W/m2. The power density per unit area achieved for the sodium perchlorate system, using the same synthesis conditions, was 55 W/m2.|$|E
5000|$|An {{insulated}} cable {{a few hundred}} meters to several kilometers long is laid parallel to the geological strike direction. The cable is either grounded at both ends or {{laid out in a}} large loop, and energized at low frequencies (less than 1 kHz). Two receiving coils are moved on lines outside of and perpendicular to the long side of the loop or grounded cable and two components of the resultant field are measured. The primary field generated by the large loop or cable interacts with the soil and subsoil and with a conductive body if present which could be a mineral and creates a resultant electromagnetic field. The electromagnetic field is measured according to two values: the Field Strength Ratio and the Phase Difference occurring between the two receiving coils [...] It is a <b>fixed</b> <b>source</b> horizontal loop method. Separation of the two moving coils is usually from 10 to 30 metres. Using an AC bridge (also called compensator bridge), Field Strength Ratio is measured in percent and Phase Difference in degrees. In-phase (Real) and quadrature (Imaginary) values can be calculated from these data. Observed field strength ratio readings are used to calculate reduced ratios using a formula determined by the loop size and shape or the grounded wire length and the position of the receiving coils relative to the loop or grounded wire. The Turam method is a frequency domain method and in a way is the precursor of the time domain fixed loop methods. It is claimed to have detected large flat lying conductors to a depth of 400 metres.|$|E
5000|$|The jeevitham is {{the pension}} {{entitled}} to each Ooralan for officiating his dignity. It is a due {{in respect of}} his station and his sacrifices and proportionate to relative contributions of individual families {{in the past that}} he stands to represent. In the very old past the expenditure of the temple was solely dependent on income from donation-box-revenue (Bhandara-pirivu) and offerings (Vazhipaadu) alone. There was no <b>fixed</b> <b>source</b> of stable income. Therefore, the then 9 ooralars donated most of their family lands in the name of their family deities as donation with the objective that this pool of property will generate a stable income for the temple. This pooled capital was the source of subsequent financial prosperity of our Kavu and lead to the Kavu using the profit from this initial donation to acquire more land and expand its income exponentially thereafter. In due memory of this sacrifice and respecting dignity of their station, when the income of the Kavu increased, a traditional pension scheme called jeevitham was permanently instituted for the Ooralars. The Jeevitham pension was in terms of measures of paddy called seer. The history of the Kavu has shown that they have always readjusted the nature of the original jeevitham-pension {{from time to time to}} suit the financial income of the temple. When the land reforms and land ceiling was introduced in Kerala and further loss of land to tenants resulted in drastic reduction of income, the Ooralars once again made a magnanimous sacrifice. They revised their jeevitham pension from huge measures of paddy to an obsolete and paltry rupee equivalent of it ( [...] 1 and odd rupees !) and accepted that as a token due to their dignity. In recent times HR & CE and Malabar Devaswom board revised the pay-scale of Malabar temple employees while completely neglecting to revise the due Jeevitham-pension of Ooralars ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, NO (nitrogen monooxide) {{adsorption}} {{ability of}} a soil filter was considered both experimentally and theoretically {{as the first step}} in developing a new nitrogen recovery system using the soil filter and plants. In this proposed system, a gas component NO that is discharged from <b>fixed</b> <b>sources</b> such as incineration plants will be trapped by a soil filter and transformed into NO 3 -, and then absorbed by the plants. At first, by comparing the O 2 breakthrough curve obtained experimentally with that calculated from the analytical solution of O 2 concentration, the apparent gas diffusivity in the soil filter was obtained. Next, assuming that the rate of adsorption follows a linear driving force (LDF) model, two parameters a (equilibrium constant) and Θ (time constant) of the LDF model were evaluated for each experiment, and a solution of NO concentration was numerically derived. The validity of the solution was proved by comparing the NO breakthrough curve obtained experimentally with that calculated numerically. The value of Θ greatly differs according to soil texture, and the value of a is large under moderate moisture content conditions. Since the adsorption ability of the soil filter is small, however, it seems insufficient to use the soil alone as a filter to trap NO from <b>fixed</b> <b>sources...</b>|$|R
