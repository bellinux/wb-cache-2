5|$|Several {{men of the}} {{regiment}} were recognised for their service by the British Empire awards system. The regiment's first commanding officer, Meldrum, was invested as a Companion of the Order of the Bath, a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George and awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). His successor, Whyte, was also <b>invested</b> <b>with</b> a DSO, {{as well as a}} Bar as a second award. Another four officers were also <b>invested</b> <b>with</b> a DSO, while seven officers were awarded a Military Cross, one was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, and another a Member of the Order of the British Empire. The regiment's other ranks were awarded five Distinguished Conduct Medals and twenty Military Medals, and there were fifty-nine Mentions in Despatches amongst all ranks, some men being mentioned more than once.|$|E

5|$|Augusta Raurica and Aventicum {{were also}} the civitates, or capitals, of the non-Roman tribes of the Rauraci and Helvetii, respectively. In that capacity, the magistrates of Aventicum, as duoviri coloniae Helvetiorum, also governed the entire Helvetic population, which had {{the legal status of}} incolae (inhabitants) <b>invested</b> <b>with</b> the Latin Right. The rights of the Roman coloni, or colonists, were {{represented}} by a special authority, the curatores colonorum Aventicensum ("Heads of the colonists of Aventicum"). Moreover, the Roman citizens of the entire territory established the cives Romani conventus Helvetici ("Association of Roman citizens in Helvetia").|$|E
5|$|Baldwin {{was with}} King Henry {{shortly before the}} latter's death, taking part in {{unsuccessful}} efforts to negotiate a truce with Henry's heir, Prince Richard, who had rebelled against his father. After Henry's death, Richard sought and obtained absolution for the sin of disobedience to his father from both Baldwin and Walter de Coutances, Archbishop of Rouen. Baldwin, along with Coutances, was with Richard on 20 July 1189 at Rouen when the king was <b>invested</b> <b>with</b> the Duchy of Normandy. Baldwin crowned Richard at Westminster Abbey on 13 September 1189 in the first English coronation for which a detailed description survives.|$|E

5|$|Oliver Cromwell, {{who led the}} {{uprising}} and declined invitations to be made king, became Lord Protector of England in 1657. It was marked by a ceremony in Westminster Hall, where he donned purple robes, sat on the Coronation Chair, and was <b>invested</b> <b>with</b> many of the traditional symbols of sovereignty, except a crown. A crown, perhaps saved from the melting pot in 1649, was placed beside Cromwell at his lying in state in 1660.|$|E

5|$|The {{essential}} elements of the coronation have remained largely unchanged for the past thousand years. The sovereign is first presented to, and acclaimed by, the people. He or she then swears an oath to uphold {{the law and the}} Church. Following that, the monarch is anointed with holy oil, <b>invested</b> <b>with</b> regalia, and crowned, before receiving the homage of his or her subjects. Wives of kings are then anointed and crowned as queen consort. The service ends with a closing procession, and since the 20th century it has been traditional for the royal family to appear later on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, before attending a banquet there.|$|E
5|$|After Leane's {{retirement}} {{as police}} commissioner, he briefly continued {{his work with}} the VDC, resigning on 30 July 1944. He was knighted in the 1945 King's birthday honours for his services as police commissioner over a 24 year period. For his service with the VDC during World War II he was issued with the War Medal 1939–1945 and Australia Service Medal 1939–1945. In 1946, he became the inaugural president of the Plympton branch of the conservative Liberal and Country League, the forerunner of the state Liberal Party. He continued to lead the Adelaide Anzac Day March each year, and on 7 September 1946 was <b>invested</b> <b>with</b> his knighthood by the Governor-General of Australia, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{affection for}} Mary, Henry was deeply {{disappointed}} that his marriage had produced no sons. By the time Mary {{was nine years}} old, {{it was apparent that}} Henry and Catherine would have no more children, leaving Henry without a legitimate male heir. In 1525, Henry sent Mary to the border of Wales to preside, presumably in name only, over the Council of Wales and the Marches. She was given her own court based at Ludlow Castle and many of the royal prerogatives normally reserved for the Prince of Wales. Vives and others called her the Princess of Wales, although she was never technically <b>invested</b> <b>with</b> the title. She appears to have spent three years in the Welsh Marches, making regular visits to her father's court, before returning permanently to the home counties around London in mid-1528.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we analyze how the {{composition}} of the top management team (TMT) influences the portfolio strategy choice in venture capital (VC) organizations. We develop a model of risk perception to investigate how education and experience of TMT members impact whether VC organizations <b>invest</b> <b>with</b> a focus on early stage ventures or not, specialize or diversify across industries, and <b>invest</b> <b>with</b> a broad or narrow geographic scope. Evaluation of data on TMTs and portfolio strategies of 136 European VC firms revealed that VC firms with higher proportions of TMT members with science/engineering education and entrepreneurial experience more likely <b>invest</b> <b>with</b> an early stage focus. Furthermore, TMTs with more management education diversify their portfolios more across industries. Finally, the more international experience TMT members of VC organizations have, the broader the geographic scope of investees. We discuss the implications of our findings for the VC literature.

5|$|Howell's {{multiple}} wounds at Bullecourt {{required a}} prolonged hospitalisation period for treatment, {{and he was}} sent to the Norfolk and Norwich War Hospital in England. On 21 July 1917, Howell was <b>invested</b> <b>with</b> his Victoria Cross and Military Medal by King George V in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace. A photograph of the pair together was taken at this time, and later published in the Times History of the War. Promoted to sergeant, Howell returned to Australia on 31 October. Having not adequately recovered from his wounds, he was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 5 June 1918 on medical grounds. Howell's father and one of his brothers had also served on the Western Front during the First World War; his father with the 54th Battalion and his brother, Frederick, with the 1st Pioneer Battalion.|$|E
5|$|In August 1701, George was <b>invested</b> <b>with</b> the Order of the Garter and, {{within six}} weeks, the nearest Catholic {{claimant}} to the thrones, the former king James II, died. William III died the following March and was succeeded by Anne. Sophia became heiress presumptive {{to the new}} Queen of England. Sophia was in her seventy-first year, older than Anne by thirty-five years, but she was very fit and healthy and invested time and energy in securing the succession either for herself or her son. However, it was George who understood the complexities of English politics and constitutional law, which required further acts in 1705 to naturalise Sophia and her heirs as English subjects, and to detail arrangements for the transfer of power through a Regency Council. In the same year, George's surviving uncle died and he inherited further German dominions: the Principality of Lüneburg-Grubenhagen, centred at Celle.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{was born}} at the Archbishop's Palace, Bordeaux, in the English principality of Aquitaine, on 6 January 1367. According to {{contemporary}} sources, three kings"the King of Castille, the King of Navarre and the King of Portugal"were present at his birth. This anecdote, {{and the fact that}} his birth fell on the feast of Epiphany, was later used in the religious imagery of the Wilton Diptych, where Richard is one of three kings paying homage to the Virgin and Child. His elder brother Edward of Angoulême died near his sixth birthday in 1371, and Richard became his father's heir. The Black Prince finally succumbed to his long illness in June 1376. The Commons in parliament genuinely feared that Richard's uncle, John of Gaunt, would usurp the throne. For this reason, the prince was quickly <b>invested</b> <b>with</b> the princedom of Wales and his father's other titles.|$|E

Findlay was invested as a Companion of the Order of the Bath and awarded a DSO, alongside six other officers who were also <b>invested</b> <b>with</b> the DSO. One officer was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, and another a Member of the Order of the British Empire.

5|$|She {{suffered}} another serious financial setback in 1835 {{when she}} {{lost most of}} her life savings, about £300, in a bad investment. Sources differ somewhat on what exactly went wrong. Deborah Cadbury says that she <b>invested</b> <b>with</b> a conman who swindled her and disappeared with the money, but Shelley Emling writes that {{it is not clear whether}} the man ran off with the money or whether he died suddenly leaving Anning with no way to recover the investment. Concerned about her financial situation, her old friend William Buckland persuaded the British Association for the Advancement of Science and the British government to award her an annuity, known as a civil list pension, in return for her many contributions to the science of geology. The £25 annual pension gave her a certain amount of financial security.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the new Knights Companions were knighted by the King and <b>invested</b> <b>with</b> their ribands and badges on 27 May 1725. Although the statutes set out the full medieval ceremony {{which was to be}} used for creating knights, this was not performed, and indeed was possibly never intended to be, as the original statutes contained a provision allowing the Great Master to dispense Knights Companion from these requirements. The original knights were dispensed from all the medieval ceremonies {{with the exception of the}} Installation, which was performed in the Order's Chapel, the Henry VII Chapel in Westminster Abbey, on 17 June. This precedent was followed until 1812, after which the Installation was also dispensed with, until its revival in the twentieth century. The ceremonies however remained part of the Statutes until 1847.|$|E
