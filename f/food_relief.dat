5|$|In 1991, the Somali Civil War {{drew the}} world's attention. In August 1992, the United States began to provide {{humanitarian}} assistance, primarily food, through a military airlift. At President Bush's direction, Cheney dispatched {{the first of}} 26,000 U.S. troops to Somalia {{as part of the}} Unified Task Force (UNITAF), designed to provide security and <b>food</b> <b>relief.</b> Cheney's successors as Secretary of Defense, Les Aspin and William J.

25|$|While as Rhodesia, {{the country}} was once {{considered}} the breadbasket of Africa. Today, Zimbabwe is a net importer of foodstuffs, with the European Union and United States providing emergency <b>food</b> <b>relief</b> as humanitarian aid on a regular basis. The nation has suffered profound economic and social decline in the past twenty years. Recently the agriculture sector has started to do well since the availability of expertise and machines has improved supported mainly by China.|$|E
25|$|On 1 May 2010, the West African {{nation of}} Chad {{was on the}} verge of a {{nationwide}} famine as drought, armed conflict, and an influx of Darfur refugees all contributed to a chronic food shortage that now affects 2,000,000 people (20% of the country's total population). Various aid groups, NGOs and charities said a catastrophic famine could hit the country in the near future if <b>food</b> <b>relief</b> does not arrive soon.

500|$|Despite {{criticism}} of the Tamil Nadu government's mishandling of the crisis, many notable personalities and other people helped those affected by floods. In Chennai, people across the city offered aid, shelter and food through social media channels like Twitter, Whatsapp, and Facebook. Social media sites were also used extensively to relay information about flooded areas, rescue agencies and <b>food</b> and <b>relief</b> centers. Chennai residents set up a temporary website to crowd source information about people needing help and about those who were ready to help. Celebrities such as RJ Balaji, actor Siddharth and Chinmayi actively participated in the relief process by using social media to coordinate aid and gather information. Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh members distributed <b>food</b> and <b>relief</b> materials in various rain-hit areas of Chennai, districts of Cuddalore and Kancheepuram. RSS workers swung into action immediately, involved in rescuing operations wading through neck-deep water. Swayamsevaks cleared street lamp post, cleared traffic, distributed <b>food</b> and <b>relief</b> materials. Around 5500 RSS-Sevabharati volunteers served the affected areas. [...] Food was distributed to 21 lakh people in 118 relief centres; family kit was distributed with 20 essential items to 63000 families. [...] Around 133 medical camps were conducted with 160 Doctors benefitting 23000 people. Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu visited and distributed relief materials to the flood victims at Tambaram.|$|R
25|$|The {{advent of}} World War II led Weston to abandon {{painting}} entirely in 1942 {{in favor of}} political work. Disturbed by memories of the starvation {{he had seen in}} the Middle East, he lobbied full-time for humanitarian <b>food</b> <b>relief.</b> In 1943, he founded Food for Freedom, and built a coalition of civic, religious, labor and farm organizations representing more than 60 million Americans which advocated for food aid for refugees in Europe and Asia. He became an expert on food policy and the politics of farm policy in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|Somalia {{turned out}} to be Aspin's biggest headache. A civil war {{involving}} various clans had engulfed the country since 1991. Direct U.S. involvement, begun in August 1992, provided food through a military airlift and other means to the people of Somalia. In December 1992, shortly before Aspin became secretary of defense, the United States joined a new Unified Task Force (UNITAF) to provide security as well as <b>food</b> <b>relief.</b> The United States sent 26,000 troops to Somalia to join about 13,000 others from more than 20 nations. UNITAF, operating until May 1993, restored order in Somalia and distributed food widely.|$|E
25|$|Although infants, young children, and {{the elderly}} might be {{expected}} to be more susceptible to the effects of starvation and disease, in fact adults and children aged 10–14 suffered the highest proportional mortality rises overall. Female infant death rates were higher than for male infants, but males suffered higher rates overall and in every other age range. The relatively protected status of females of child-bearing age may have resulted in part from fertility decreases brought on by malnutrition, which in turn reduced maternal deaths. The higher death rates for female infants held true in both urban and rural areas, perhaps reflecting a discriminatory bias. Other age- and sex-related statistics were inverted in urban Bengal, perhaps because the cities attracted large numbers of very young and very old migrants seeking <b>food</b> <b>relief.</b> However, there were no differences in the death rates for the sexes in urban areas.|$|E

25|$|Among the NGO responses, {{among the}} most {{comprehensive}} disaster response came from the Taiwan-based , which organized a large-scale cash-for-work program in Tacloban from Nov 20 to Dec 8 with up to 31,000 participants per day, totaling nearly 300,000 day shifts. This operation not only helped clean out the {{thousands of tons of}} debris covering the city, but also kick-started the local economy. Tzu Chi also contributed emergency cash aid of 8000, 12000 or 15000 pesos depending on family size for over 60,000 families in the affected areas of Tacloban, Ormoc, Palo, Tanauan and Tunga, and has been providing free clinics, hot meals, and temporary class rooms for over 15 schools in the area. Doctors Without Borders is sending 200 tons of aid. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness's Food For Life Global, the world's largest vegan <b>food</b> <b>relief</b> organisation, raised money and provided vegan meals in the Philippines to Typhoon Haiyan survivors. Other NGOs run by faith-based organisations that raised money and/or aided in the disaster relief efforts of Typhoon Haiyan included Catholic Relief Services, Catholic Medical Mission Board (CMMB), Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA), LDS Philanthropies, American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (AJJDC), Samaritan's Purse, Salvation Army, Christian Children's Fund of Canada, MAP International and World Vision.|$|E
500|$|Many flood victims across Chennai and Tamil Nadu {{protested the}} state's ineffectual {{response}} {{and the lack}} of help from authorities. In the chief minister's state assembly constituency of Dr. Radhakrishnan Nagar, flood victims heckled senior ministers Natham Viswanathan, Sellur Raju and Gokul Indira following their visit on 4 December, forcing them to make a hasty retreat. At a subsequent press conference, Tamil Nadu Power Minister Natham Viswanathan and chief secretary Gnanadesikan claimed that relief and rescue work were in full swing and [...] "extraordinary". Viswanathan deflected opposition criticism of relief efforts as politically motivated, in light of upcoming assembly elections. He claimed people in even the worst-affected localities had refused to leave their homes and had accepted only <b>food</b> <b>relief</b> from official agencies.|$|E

2500|$|Humanitarian {{aid from}} North Korea's neighbors {{has been cut}} off at times in order to provoke North Korea into {{resuming}} boycotted talks. For example, South Korea decided to [...] "postpone consideration" [...] of 500,000 tons of rice for the North in 2006, {{but the idea of}} providing food as a clear incentive (as opposed to resuming [...] "general humanitarian aid") has been avoided. There have also been aid disruptions due to widespread theft of railway cars used by mainland China to deliver <b>food</b> <b>relief.</b>|$|E

The Muslim and Sikh populations were strongly supportive of the British war effort, but the Hindu population was divided. Congress opposed the war, and tens of thousands of its leaders were imprisoned in 1942–45. [...] A major famine in eastern India led to hundreds of thousands of deaths by starvation, and remains a highly controversial issue regarding Churchill's reluctance to provide emergency <b>food</b> <b>relief.</b>|$|E

2500|$|By 1932, about 62% of {{households}} involved in agriculture {{were part of}} collectives, and by 1936 this had risen to 90%. Many of the peasants who had been collectivised resented {{the loss of their}} private farmland, and productivity slumped. Famine broke out in many areas, with the Politburo frequently ordering the distribution of emergency <b>food</b> <b>relief</b> to these regions. Armed peasant uprisings against dekulakisation and collectivisation broke out in Ukraine, northern Caucasus, southern Russia, and central Asia, reaching their apex in March 1930; these were repressed by the Red Army. Stalin responded to the uprisings with an article insisting that collectivisation was voluntary and blaming any violence and other excesses on local officials. Bukharin expressed concerns about these policies; he regarded them as a return to Lenin's old [...] "war communism" [...] policy and believed that it would fail. However, by the summer of 1928 he was unable to rally sufficient support in the party to oppose the reforms. In November 1929 Stalin removed him from the Politburo.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{from the}} time of the famine, it was debated whether the crisis was caused by a crop {{shortfall}} in the aman harvest of late 1942 or by a failure in distribution of a rice harvest which was nearly sufficient to feed the populace of Bengal. The most influential and widely accepted analysis belongs to Amartya Sen, who concluded: [...] "The current [...] supply for 1943 was only about 5% lower than the average of the preceding five years. It was, in fact, 13% higher than in 1941, and there was, of course, no famine in 1941." [...] The Famine Commission Report concluded that the overall deficit in rice in Bengal in 1943, taking into account an estimate of the amount of carryover of rice from the previous harvest, was about three weeks supply. Even under normal circumstances, this would have been a significant shortfall requiring a considerable amount of <b>food</b> <b>relief,</b> but not a deficit large enough to create widespread deaths by starvation. According to this view, the famine [...] "was not a crisis of food availability, but of the [...] distribution of food and income." ...|$|E
