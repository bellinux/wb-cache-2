Marriage <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> conventions. It is not a rigid law but a social custom that evolves.|$|E

25|$|Microlithography and {{nanolithography}} refer {{specifically to}} lithographic patterning methods capable of structuring material on a fine scale. Typically, features smaller than 10 micrometers are considered microlithographic, and features smaller than 100 nanometers are considered nanolithographic. Photolithography <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> methods, often applied to semiconductor manufacturing of microchips. Photolithography is also commonly used for fabricating Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices. Photolithography generally uses a pre-fabricated photomask or reticle {{as a master}} from which the final pattern is derived.|$|E

25|$|In Burundi and Rwanda, most, {{if not all}} {{surnames}} have God in it, {{for example}} Hakizimana (meaning God cures), Nshimirimana (I thank God) or Havyarimana/Habyarimana (God gives birth).

Irakoze <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> (technically meaning Thank God, though {{it is hard to}} translate it correctly in English or probably any other language). Surnames are often different among immediate family members, as parents frequently choose unique surnames for each child, and women keep their maiden names when married. Surnames are placed before given names and frequently written in capital letters, e.g. HAKIZIMANA Jacques.|$|E
25|$|The patrilineal {{definition}} {{is based on}} an important orthodox law of Pashtunwali which mainly requires that only those who have a Pashtun father are Pashtun. This law has maintained the tradition of exclusively patriarchal tribal lineage. This definition places less emphasis on what language one speaks, such as Pashto, Dari, Hindko, Urdu, Hindi or English. There are various communities who claim Pashtun origin but are largely found among other ethnic groups in the region who generally do not speak the Pashto language. These communities are often considered overlapping groups or are simply assigned to the ethno-linguistic group that corresponds to their geographic location and mother tongue. The Niazi <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> group.|$|E
25|$|Solar {{chimneys}}, {{also called}} heat chimneys or heat stacks, {{can also be}} used in architectural settings to decrease the energy used by mechanical systems (systems that heat and cool the building through mechanical means). Air conditioning and mechanical ventilation have been for decades the standard method of environmental control in many building types, especially offices, in developed countries. Pollution and reallocating energy supplies have led to a new environmental approach in building design. Innovative technologies along with bioclimatic principles and traditional design strategies are often combined to create new and potentially successful design solutions. The solar chimney <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> concepts currently explored by scientists as well as designers, mostly through research and experimentation.|$|E

25|$|Hydro-Québec {{has been}} criticized for not having taken {{advantage}} of some of its innovations.

Hydro-Québec announced in early 2009 at the Montreal International Auto Show that its engine had been chosen by Tata Motors to equip a demonstration version of its Indica model, which will be road tested in Norway.|$|E
25|$|By the 16th century, {{there is}} no {{reliable}} information about any practicing Christians remaining in China. Fairly soon after {{the establishment of the}} direct European maritime contact with China (1513), and the creation of the Society of Jesus (1540), at least some Chinese become involved with the Jesuit effort. As early as 1546, two Chinese boys became enrolled into the Jesuits' St. Paul's College in Goa, the capital of Portuguese India. It <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> two Christian Chinese, known as Antonio, who accompanied St. Francis Xavier, a co-founder of the Society of Jesus, when he decided to start missionary work in China.

25|$|A {{number of}} {{communities}} are noted for weaving. El Jorongo <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these,</b> for items made both on back strap and pedal looms. Back strap and pedal looms {{are used in}} the Nahua coastal areas and the Mazahua mountain areas of the state for both everyday and festive wear. The finest woven products of both wool and cotton are made in Patzcuaro, Uruapan and Zamora, producing rebozos, other traditional clothing, and linens. Wool items are woven on backstrap looms is only done in the Purepecha region and part of the Mazahua region {{in the eastern part of}} the state. Angahuan is noted for its rebozos, blankets, echequemos, ruanas and heavy fabrics with images of birds, flowers and geometric patterns. Heavy jackets are made in Pichátaro, Santa Clara del Cobre, Cherán, Comachúen, Macho de Agua, Nahuatzen, Sevina and Charapan. In Tarecuato, backstrap looms create wool belts and in Cuanajo, they make pouches, belts and more in a “dog leg” pattern. In Boca de la Cañada, Crescencio Morales and Macho de Agua, rebozos, cobijas, jackets, carrying bags and more are created with fabric made on backstrap looms, with elements such as stars, fretwork and deer.|$|E
