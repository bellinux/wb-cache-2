5|$|Hadrocodium, whose fossils {{date from}} {{approximately}} 195 million years ago, {{in the early}} Jurassic, provides the first clear evidence of a jaw joint formed solely by the squamosal and dentary bones; there is no space <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> for the articular, a bone involved in the jaws of all early synapsids.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known turtles {{are from}} fossils in the Upper Triassic. These fossils are nearly indistinguishable from modern turtles anatomically. In these early fossils (mostly {{of the genus}} Proganochelys), the teeth have already been lost, and a keratin beak {{is suggested by the}} mandibles. Important differences between Proganochelys and modern turtles are the presence of the palatal teeth (lost in modern species), the inability to retract the head within the shell, and the lack of a trochlear pulley <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> closing anatomy.|$|E
5|$|The {{lower jaw}} was slender {{and had no}} mandibular fenestra, {{a hole in the}} side of the lower jawbone {{commonly}} seen in archosaurs. The teeth were small but sharp, suited for its diet of small vertebrates and possibly other small animals, such as insects. Its frontmost teeth (those on the premaxilla) were unserrated, unlike those further back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> which were flattened and more strongly recurved. Scientists have used these dental characteristics to identify Compsognathus and its closest relatives. Reisdorf and Wuttke (2012) described the taphonomical phenomena of the German specimen of Compsognathus.|$|E
40|$|Pseudotumor of {{hemophilia}} (PTH) {{is a rare}} complication seen {{in approximately}} 1 – 2 % of cases of hemophilia. Although much more common <b>in</b> long bones, <b>the</b> pelvis, and small bones of the hands and feet than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jaws,</b> occasionally hemorrhage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> occurs with this result. We present a case in a two-year-old male with a one-month swelling of the right mandible without significant medical history or diagnosis of hemophilia who was subsequently diagnosed as having Factor IX deficiency, or hemophilia B. A {{review of the literature}} revealed only 15 reported cases of PTH of <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> and salient features of PTH <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> are discussed. <b>The</b> differential diagnosis of masses occurring <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> of children is limited and PTH should be considered when a mass presents with rapid growth and the histopathologic features are not diagnostic for a neoplastic process, even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence of a prior diagnosis of hemophilia as PTH may be the initial manifestation of this disease...|$|R

25|$|Wisdom teeth become {{impacted}} {{when there}} is not enough room <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> to allow for all of the teeth to erupt into the mouth. Because the wisdom teeth are the last to erupt, due to insufficient room <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> to accommodate more teeth, the wisdom teeth become stuck <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jaws,</b> i.e., impacted. There is a genetic predisposition to tooth impaction. Genetics plays an important, albeit unpredictable role in dictating jaw and tooth size and tooth eruption potential of the teeth. Some also believe that there is an evolutionary decrease in jaw size due to softer modern diets that are more refined and less coarse than our ancestors'.|$|R
5|$|The oldest dinosaur embryos ever {{discovered}} {{were found}} in the park in 1978. The eggs were from the Triassic Period (220 to 195 million years ago) and had fossilised foetal skeletons of Massospondylus, a prosauropod dinosaur. More examples of these eggs have since been found in the park. Other fossils found in the park include those of advanced cynodontia (canine toothed animals), small thecodontia (animals with teeth set firmly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jaw),</b> bird-like and crocodile-like dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Behind the incisors and canines, {{there were}} no {{additional}} teeth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jaw.</b> Where teeth would be located in therocephalians that do have teeth behind the canines, there is instead a large depression, or fossa, {{on the side of}} the maxilla, which is also bounded below by part of the lacrimal and possibly part of the jugal. This fossa is 48% the length of the jaw in the type specimen, and 38% in the second skull. In both skulls, this fossa is divided into two parts: a shallower ridge on top, and a larger and deeper depression on the bottom. A wide furrow beginning behind the canine contacts the bottom of the fossa and then passes into the interior of the mouth. The bottom portion of the fossa is strongly pitted and bears a small opening, or foramen, on both the front and back surfaces.|$|E
5|$|He is the player's first {{opponent}} {{in all of}} his roles and is famous for his weakness and cowardice. These elements are considered by critics to be stereotypes of French people. These characteristics were emphasized by the developer of the Wii game which included cutscenes which depict Glass Joe in French settings. Glass Joe {{is considered one of the}} most well-known characters in the Punch-Out!! series and a Nintendo icon. His name has been used to describe poor performance by sportspeople and teams. In The Wii game his dialogue consists of him pleading not for the player to strike him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jaw,</b> complaints about the tightness of his gloves, and counting to ten in French.|$|E

50|$|Fruitadens {{was similar}} to Heterodontosaurus in anatomy, with {{relatively}} short arms and long distal sections of the legs (feet and shins). <b>The</b> lower <b>jaws</b> had an enlarged canine-like tooth, with a corresponding gap <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>jaw.</b> Unlike Echinodon, there wasn't an enlarged tooth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>jaw.</b> Uniquely, a small peg-like tooth was present <b>in</b> front of <b>the</b> canine-like tooth. Replacement teeth were present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jaws,</b> unlike most other heterodontosaurids. The hind limb bones were hollow, like those of small theropod dinosaurs. Fruitadens {{seems to have been}} more closely related to Heterodontosaurus than Echinodon, which was closer in time.|$|R
5|$|In the 2000s, {{additional}} {{members of}} Ferugliotheriidae were described. In 2004, Francisco Goin and colleagues described a single enigmatic tooth from the Paleogene of Peru, LACM 149371; their best estimate {{was that it}} represented a member of Ferugliotheriidae. On {{the basis of a}} single p4, Kielan-Jaworowska and colleagues named Argentodites coloniensis, from the Late Cretaceous La Colonia Formation of Argentina, in 2007 as a multituberculate, possibly referable to the suborder Cimolodonta. Gurovich and Beck argued, however, that the p4 of Argentodites did not differ materially from that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> they allocated to Ferugliotherium, and that Argentodites was based on a specimen of either Ferugliotherium or a closely related animal. Guillermo Rougier and colleagues described mammals from the Allen Formation, a third Argentinean formation of similar age, in 2009, including a new ferugliotheriid, Trapalcotherium matuastensis. They also regarded Argentodites as a likely relative of Ferugliotherium and suggested that Ferugliotheriidae are either multituberculates or closely related to them.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} between teleosts and other bony fish lies mainly in their jaw bones; teleosts have a movable premaxilla and corresponding modifications <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> musculature which {{make it possible}} for them to protrude their jaws outwards from the mouth. This is of great advantage, enabling them to grab prey and draw it into the mouth. In more derived teleosts, the enlarged premaxilla is the main tooth-bearing bone, and the maxilla, which is attached to the lower jaw, acts as a lever, pushing and pulling the premaxilla as the mouth is opened and closed. Other bones further back in the mouth serve to grind and swallow food. Another difference is that the upper and lower lobes of the tail (caudal) fin are about equal in size. The spine ends at the caudal peduncle, distinguishing this group from other fish in which the spine extends into the upper lobe of the tail fin.|$|E
5|$|The dentary (lower jaw bone) {{itself is}} robust and short. The length {{axis of the}} p4 makes an angle of about 58° with the length axis of the jawbone. The bone is concave on the lingual, but convex on the labial side. There is a {{diastema}} (gap) between the p4 and the incisor {{that would have been}} in front of it, as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> of Sudamerica. Gurovich estimated the length of the diastema as 2.5mm. There is a rounded mental foramen (an opening in the labial side of the jawbone), with a diameter of 0.7mm, located about 0.8mm below the dorsal margin of the bone and 1.5mm in front of the p4. Although the incisor itself is not preserved, its alveolus (the housing of the root) is in part. As in Sudamerica, it extends far into the dentary, passing below p4. The alveolus is 1.5mm wide below the front root of p4 and 1.4mm {{at the back of the}} jaw fragment. Although the height of the alveolus cannot be determined because the lower side is broken away, the incisor must have been quite deep.|$|E
50|$|Bharatagama {{belongs to}} a group of iguanians called Acrodonta, which today {{includes}} chameleons and agamids. Modern acrodontans are characterized by their acrodont dentition, meaning that their teeth implant along the margins of <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> rather than their inner surfaces, the so-called pleurodont dentition seen in most other lizards. Most of <b>the</b> teeth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> of Bharatagama are acrodont, but the first five pairs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>jaw</b> and first four <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>jaw</b> are pleurodont. These teeth are enlarged, recurved, and striated. The acrodont teeth behind them are sharp and triangular, likely adapted for shearing food. Some specimens preserve hatchling teeth between the acrodont and pleurodont teeth, which are conical and laterally compressed.|$|R
5|$|Jaws: The Revenge is a 1987 American horror thriller film. It was {{the final}} {{theatrical}} film to be directed by Joseph Sargent. It is the third sequel to Steven Spielberg's <b>Jaws</b> and <b>the</b> fourth and final installment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jaws</b> franchise.|$|R
5|$|The slender teeth had {{slightly}} curved crowns, {{which were}} oval <b>in</b> cross-section. <b>The</b> teeth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>jaw</b> {{may have been}} 20–30% smaller than those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>jaw,</b> but few are known, and they are of uncertain maturity. Apart from this, the teeth were identical. Under each active tooth there was a column of nine replacement teeth within <b>the</b> <b>jaw.</b> With 68 columns <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>jaws</b> and 60 columns <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>jaws,</b> these so-called dental batteries (also present in hadrosaurs and ceratopsians) comprised {{a total of more}} than 500 active and replacement teeth. Dental batteries erupted in unison, not each column individually. The enamel on the teeth of Nigersaurus was highly asymmetrical, ten times thicker on the outwards facing side than on the inner side. This condition is otherwise known only in advanced ornithischians.|$|R
5|$|The initial {{round of}} gunfire killed only the Tsar, the Empress and two male servants, and wounded Grand Duchess Maria, Dr Botkin and the Empress' maidservant, Demidova. At {{that point the}} gunmen {{had to leave the}} room because of smoke and toxic fumes from their guns and plaster dust their bullets had {{released}} from the walls. After allowing the haze to clear for several minutes, the gunmen returned. Dr Botkin was killed, and a gunman named Ermakov repeatedly tried to shoot Tsarevich Alexei, but failed because jewels sewn into the boy's clothes shielded him. Ermakov tried to stab Alexei with a bayonet but failed again, and finally Yurovsky fired two shots into the boy's head. Yurovsky and Ermakov approached Olga and Tatiana, who were crouched against the room's rear wall, clinging to each other and screaming for their mother. Ermakov stabbed both young women with his 8-inch bayonet, but had difficulty penetrating their torsos because of the jewels that had been sewn into their chemises. The sisters tried to stand, but Tatiana was killed instantly when Yurovsky shot her {{in the back of her}} head. A moment later, Olga too died when Ermakov shot her <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jaw.</b>|$|E
5|$|The order Rodentia may {{be divided}} into suborders, infraorders, superfamilies and families. There {{is a great deal}} of {{parallelism}} and convergence among rodents caused by the fact that they have tended to evolve to fill largely similar niches. This parallel evolution includes not only the structure of the teeth, but also the infraorbital region of the skull (below the eye socket) and makes classification difficult as similar traits may not be due to common ancestry. Brandt (1855) was the first to propose dividing Rodentia into three suborders, Sciuromorpha, Hystricomorpha and Myomorpha, based on the development of certain muscles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> and this system was widely accepted. Schlosser (1884) performed a comprehensive review of rodent fossils, mainly using the cheek teeth, and found that they fitted into the classical system, but Tullborg (1899) proposed just two sub-orders, Sciurognathi and Hystricognathi. These were based on the degree of inflection of the lower jaw and were to be further subdivided into Sciuromorpha, Myomorpha, Hystricomorpha and Bathyergomorpha. Matthew (1910) created a phylogenetic tree of New World rodents but did not include the more problematic Old World species. Further attempts at classification continued without agreement, with some authors adopting the classical three suborder system and others Tullborg's two suborders.|$|E

25|$|Eoraptor {{is thought}} to have been an omnivore. It was a swift {{sprinter}} and, upon catching its prey, it would use claws and teeth to tear the prey apart. Unlike later, carnivorous dinosaurs, it lacked a sliding joint at the articulation of <b>the</b> lower <b>jaw,</b> with which to hold large prey. Furthermore, only some of its teeth were curved and saw-edged, unlike those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mouths of later theropods. The unique heterodont dentition of Eoraptor (Sereno et al., 1993) consists of both serrated, recurved teeth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>jaw,</b> like <b>the</b> teeth of later theropods, and leaf-shaped teeth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>jaw,</b> like <b>the</b> teeth of basal sauropodomorphs. Eoraptor had 4 teeth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>jaw</b> and 18 teeth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>jaw,</b> a dental formula not dissimilar to that of Herrerasaurus.|$|R
