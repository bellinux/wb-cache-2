5|$|The {{value of}} eating a certain food to {{maintain}} health was recognized long before vitamins were identified. The ancient Egyptians knew that feeding liver {{to a person}} may help with night blindness, an illness now known {{to be caused by}} a vitamin A deficiency. The advancement of ocean voyages during the Renaissance resulted in prolonged periods without access to fresh <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables,</b> <b>and</b> made illnesses from vitamin deficiency common among ships' crews.|$|E
5|$|Applewood Farm {{has served}} as a farm for over a century, with an 1850 census {{reporting}} it produced butter, cheese, rye, Indian corn, oats, wool, Irish potatoes and hay. Three apple orchards planted by Russell Gallup would become an important part of Applewood Farms and owe its name to those orchards. After Everett Gallup took over the farm in the 1920s, the farm produced fresh <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> poultry, eggs and dairy products. In 1994, the Applewood Farm reported having 700 trees tapped for maple syrup production and showed visitors the process of producing the syrup. Applewood Farms was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 under criteria A for the Gallup family history that {{played an important role in}} the local history and under criteria C as an architecturally important example of a late colonial center chimney house.|$|E

25|$|The New England Journal of Medicine {{published}} an article in 1994 about a trial which {{examined the relationship between}} daily supplementation of β-carotene and vitamin E (α-tocopherol) and the incidence of lung cancer. The study was done using supplements and researchers were aware of the epidemiological correlation between carotenoid-rich <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> lower lung cancer rates. The research concluded that no reduction in lung cancer was found in the participants using these supplements, and furthermore, these supplements may, in fact, have harmful effects.|$|E
25|$|Eating a {{balanced}} diet {{with a range of}} foods from different food groups {{is the best way to}} avoid copper deficiency. In both developed and developing countries, adults, young children, and adolescents who consume diets of grain, millet, tuber, or rice along with legumes (beans) or small amounts of fish or meat, some <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables,</b> <b>and</b> some vegetable oil are likely to obtain adequate copper if their total food consumption is adequate in calories. In developed countries where consumption of red meat is high, copper intake is also likely to be adequate.|$|E
25|$|This {{is a large}} {{topic of}} study. It refers to any {{productive}} extraction and includes juicing of <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> wringing (desirable fluids) out of cloths, as the juice or water inside the fruit is considered 'desirable' for these purposes, while the pulp of the fruit would be the 'undesirable.' As such, squeezing (S'chita) is forbidden unless certain rules are applied. The wringing of undesirable water out of cloths may come under the law of Melabain (Scouring/Laundering). One could view this activity as extraction, while Borer (separation) is more akin to purification.|$|E

25|$|The Mediterranean diet {{forms the}} basis of Italian cuisine, rich in pasta, fish, <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> characterised by its extreme {{simplicity}} and variety, with many dishes having only four to eight ingredients. Italian cooks rely chiefly {{on the quality of}} the ingredients rather than on elaborate preparation. Dishes and recipes are often derivatives from local and familial tradition rather than created by chefs, so many recipes are ideally suited for home cooking, this being one of the main reasons behind the ever-increasing worldwide popularity of Italian cuisine, from America to Asia. Ingredients and dishes vary widely by region.|$|E
2500|$|Carotenoids are red, orange, {{or yellow}} tetraterpenoids. [...] They {{function}} as accessory pigments in plants, helping to fuel photosynthesis by gathering wavelengths of light not readily absorbed by chlorophyll. [...] The most familiar carotenoids are carotene (an orange pigment found in carrots), lutein (a yellow pigment found in <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables),</b> <b>and</b> lycopene (the red pigment {{responsible for the}} color of tomatoes). [...] Carotenoids {{have been shown to}} act as antioxidants and to promote healthy eyesight in humans.|$|E

2500|$|But {{the main}} {{thrust of the}} plan {{actually}} lies in agriculture, contrary to the image of CPEC as a massive industrial and transport undertaking, involving power plants and highways. The plan acquires its greatest specificity, and lays out the largest number of projects and plans for their facilitation, in agriculture. For agriculture, the plan outlines an engagement that runs {{from one end of the}} supply chain all the way to the other. From provision of seeds and other inputs, like fertiliser, credit and pesticides, Chinese enterprises will also operate their own farms, processing facilities for <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> grain. Logistics companies will operate a large storage and transportation system for agrarian produce, as stated by the plan in DAWN News.|$|E
2500|$|The {{practice}} of slavery had been banned by Georgia's original charter, so Noble Jones used indentured servant labor to tend Wormsloe in the plantation's early years. [...] When the Trustees revoked {{the ban on}} slavery in 1749, Jones used slave labor {{in order to make}} Wormsloe profitable. [...] Jones initially planted several types of crops, including corn, rice, various <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables,</b> <b>and</b> possibly indigo. [...] The Georgia Trustees encouraged the production of silk; Jones planted mulberry trees and tried unsuccessfully to produce silk at Wormsloe. [...] While Wormsloe never proved profitable, Jones managed to amass real estate wealth throughout his lifetime, including [...] and five town lots in the Savannah area. [...] Jones served the young colony in multiple civic capacities, as judge, militia captain, and colonial legislator.|$|E
40|$|Many {{adults have}} poor dietary habits and {{few studies have}} focused on {{mechanisms}} underlying these behaviors. This study examined psychosocial determinants of dietary behavior change in university employees across a 5 -month period. Participants completed measures of <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> low-fat food consumption and social cognitive constructs. Multiple regression analyses accounted for a unique proportion of variation in dietary change. Outcome expectations significantly predicted <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> low-fat consumption. Self-efficacy significantly predicted low-fat consumption. Goals were not associated with dietary behaviors. Further research into implementation strategies may provide insight into how goals work to bring about change...|$|R

2500|$|The total {{geographical}} area of Gujarat is 19,602,400 hectares, of which crops take up 10,630,700 hectares [...] The three {{main sources of}} growth in Gujarat's agriculture are from cotton production, {{the rapid growth of}} high-value foods such as livestock, <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables,</b> <b>and</b> from wheat production, which saw an annual average growth rate of 28% between 2000 and 2008 (According to the International Food Policy Research Institute). Other major produce includes bajra, groundnut, cotton, rice, maize, wheat, mustard, sesame, pigeon pea, green gram, sugarcane, mango, banana, sapota, lime, guava, tomato, potato, onion, cumin, garlic, isabgul and fennel. Whilst, in recent times, Gujarat has seen a high average annual growth of 9% in the agricultural sector, the rest of India has an annual growth rate of around 3%.

2500|$|Approximately 2% of {{ingested}} chromium(III) is absorbed, {{with the}} remainder being excreted in the feces. [...] Amino acids, vitamin C and niacin may enhance the uptake of chromium from the intestinal tract. After absorption, this metal accumulates in the liver, bone, and spleen. Trivalent chromium is found {{in a wide range}} of foods, including whole-grain products, processed meats, high-bran breakfast cereals, coffee, nuts, green beans, broccoli, spices, and some brands of wine and beer. Most <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> dairy products contain only low amounts. Most of the chromium in people's diets comes from processing or storing food in pans and cans made of stainless steel, which can contain up to 18% chromium. The amount of chromium in the body can be decreased as a result of a diet high in simple sugars, which increases the excretion of the metal through urine. Because of the high excretion rates and the very low absorption rates of most forms of chromium, acute toxicity is uncommon.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1940s, despite {{continuing}} requests from editors for both fiction and non-fiction material, Lane {{turned away from}} commercial fiction writing, save for her collaboration on her mother's books. [...] At this time, she became known among libertarians as influential in the movement. She vehemently opposed the New Deal, eschewed [...] "creeping socialism," [...] Social Security, wartime rationing, and all forms of taxation. [...] Lane ceased writing highly paid commercial fiction to protest paying income taxes. Living on a small salary from her newspaper column and no longer needing to support her parents or adopted sons, she cut expenses to the bare minimum, living a modern-day version of her ancestors' pioneer life on her rural land near Danbury. She gained some media attention for her refusal to accept a ration card, instead working cooperatively with her rural neighbors to grow and preserve <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables,</b> <b>and</b> to raise chickens and pigs for meat. Literary critic and political writer Isabel Paterson had urged Lane to move to Connecticut, where she would be only [...] "up country a few miles" [...] from Paterson, {{who had been a}} friend for many years.|$|E
