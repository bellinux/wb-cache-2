5|$|Bears <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> simple {{digestive}} system typical for carnivorans, {{with a single}} stomach, short undifferentiated intestines and no cecum. Even the herbivorous giant panda still has the {{digestive system}} of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut. Bears must {{spend much of their}} time feeding in order to gain enough nutrition from foliage. The panda, in particular, spends 12–15 hours a day feeding.|$|E
5|$|Meteorology is a {{relatively}} young science {{and the study of}} tornadoes is newer still. Although researched for about 140 years and intensively for around 60 years, there are still aspects of tornadoes which remain a mystery. Scientists <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> good understanding of the development of thunderstorms and mesocyclones, and the meteorological conditions conducive to their formation. However, the step from supercell, or other respective formative processes, to tornadogenesis and the prediction of tornadic vs. non-tornadic mesocyclones is not yet well known and is the focus of much research.|$|E
5|$|The {{pinniped}} ear {{is adapted}} for hearing underwater, {{where it can}} hear sound frequencies at up to 70,000Hz. In air, hearing is somewhat reduced in pinnipeds compared to many terrestrial mammals. While {{they are capable of}} hearing a wide range of frequencies (e.g. 500 to 32,000Hz in the northern fur seal, compared to 20 to 20,000Hz in humans), their airborne hearing sensitivity is weaker overall. One study of three species—the harbor seal, California sea lion and northern elephant seal—found that the sea lion was best adapted for airborne hearing, the harbor seal was equally capable of hearing in air and water, and the elephant seal was better adapted for underwater hearing. Although pinnipeds <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> good sense of smell on land, it is useless underwater as their nostrils are closed.|$|E

25|$|The bumpnose {{trevally}} is an inshore fish, rarely venturing to depths {{greater than}} 50 m. It inhabits sandy bays and beaches, {{and appears to}} be quite tolerant of turbid waters, often living in the dirty waters near river mouths.

25|$|The {{coplanar}} {{group members}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> rigid structure, {{with their two}} phenyl rings in the same plane. It renders their structure similar to polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans, and allows them to act like PCDDs, as an agonist of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in organisms. They are considered as contributors to overall dioxin toxicity, and the term dioxins and dioxin-like compounds is often used interchangeably when the environmental and toxic impact of these compounds is considered.|$|E

25|$|The Sillaginidae are {{distributed}} throughout the Indo-Pacific region, ranging from {{the west coast of}} Africa to Japan and Taiwan in the east, as well occupying as a number of small islands including New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.

One species of sillaginid, Sillago sihama, has been declared an invasive species to the Mediterranean, passing through the Suez Canal from the Red Sea since 1977 as part of the Lessepsian migration, becoming widespread.|$|E

Mindarie Keys Medical Centre, located in the south, provides medical care for the suburb's residents, as well as dental care and physiotherapy facilities. However, the large Ocean Keys Shopping Centre in Clarkson is situated adjacent to Mindarie {{on the other side of}} Marmion Avenue, catering to the suburb's residents for major commercial shopping needs and other public services.|$|E

500|$|In January 2013, Evans {{confirmed}} {{that he would}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> significant part {{in the making of}} the album, stating [...] "I don't know at this point exactly how many songs will be on the CD, but I'm sure we'll have about four or five different-sized orchestras or bands. It'll turn into a giant panic, I can assure you. That's just how this business is." [...] Later that month, Gaga, after her performance with Bennett at the final inaugural ball of President Obama's second inauguration, announced the album formally through her Twitter. [...] "And here's me and my handsome date, I simply cannot wait for our album together, he's my darling!" [...] she wrote as a caption for a photo tweeted of the pair, along with revealing the title of the album as Cheek to Cheek.|$|E
500|$|Even if the Nazko swarm were {{a warning}} of a {{volcanic}} eruption, Hickson doubted {{it would turn}} out to be a highly explosive eruption like those that can occur in subduction-zone volcanoes. [...] "We're not talking about an injection of tonnes of ash many kilometers into the air like the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption or the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption. We're talking about something very small, relatively localized that should <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> limited impact... but it'll be extremely exciting", Hickson said. If an eruption were to occur, Hickson suggested that it would be characterized by a lava fountain that sends globs of lava [...] into the air. This is similar to those that occur in Hawaii. Hickson said that a Nazko eruption could be a tourist attraction, but warned that noxious gases such as carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide would be released during the event.|$|E
500|$|The filming {{schedule}} {{was intended to}} last 138 days but grew to 160. Many cast members came down with colds, flu, or kidney infections after spending hours in cold water, including Winslet. In the end, she decided she would not work with Cameron again unless she earned [...] "a lot of money". Several others left the production, and three stuntmen broke their bones, but the Screen Actors Guild decided, following an investigation, that nothing was inherently unsafe about the set. Additionally, DiCaprio {{said there was no}} point when he felt he was in danger during filming. Cameron believed in a passionate work ethic and never apologized for the way he ran his sets, although he acknowledged:I'm demanding, and I'm demanding on my crew. In terms of being kind of militaresque, I think there's an element of that in dealing with thousands of extras and big logistics and keeping people safe. I think you have to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> strict methodology in dealing with a large number of people.|$|E

500|$|Many of {{the songs}} from The Slim Shady LP are written from the {{perspective}} of Eminem's alter ego, Slim Shady, and contain cartoonish and over-the-top depictions of violence, which he refers to as [...] "made-up tales of trailer-park stuff". [...] The rapper explained that this subject matter is intended for entertainment value, likening his music to the horror film genre: [...] "Why can't people see that records can be like movies? [...] The only difference between some of my raps and movies is that they aren't on a screen." [...] Some of the lyrics have also been considered to be misogynistic by critics and commentators. [...] Eminem acknowledged the accusations, and clarified, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> salty relationship with women... But most of the time, when I'm saying shit about women, when I'm saying 'bitches' and 'hoes', it's so ridiculous that I'm taking the stereotypical rapper to the extreme. I don't hate women in general. They just make me mad sometimes.'" [...] Despite the album's explicit nature, Eminem refused to say the word [...] "nigga" [...] on the album, with the rapper noting, [...] "It's not in my vocabulary." [...] The Slim Shady LP begins with a [...] "Public Service Announcement" [...] introduction performed by producer Jeff Bass of the Bass Brothers, and serves as a sarcastic disclaimer discussing the album's explicit lyrical content. [...] Later in the album, a skit entitled [...] "Paul" [...] features a phone call from Paul Rosenberg to Eminem telling him to [...] "tone down" [...] his lyrics.|$|E
