5|$|Greater Manchester's {{railway network}} {{historically}} suffered from poor north–south connections {{due to the}} fact that Manchester's main railway stations, Piccadilly and Victoria, were built in the 1840s on peripheral locations outside Manchester City Centre. The central commercial district had no rail links, and over the years, a number of unsuccessful schemes were proposed to connect Manchester's rail termini. In the 1960s, transport design studies were undertaken to address the problems of increasing traffic congestion. A number of urban public transport schemes were <b>evaluated</b> <b>for</b> Manchester, including several types of monorail systems and metro-style systems.|$|E
5|$|Hidden Markov {{models are}} {{probabilistic}} models that can assign likelihoods to all possible combinations of gaps, matches, and mismatches {{to determine the}} most likely MSA or set of possible MSAs. HMMs can produce a single highest-scoring output but can also generate a family of possible alignments that can then be <b>evaluated</b> <b>for</b> biological significance. HMMs can produce both global and local alignments. Although HMM-based methods have been developed relatively recently, they offer significant improvements in computational speed, especially for sequences that contain overlapping regions.|$|E
50|$|Usually, on a CT scan, a spider-like/crab-like {{change is}} visible in the {{mesentery}} due to the fibrosis from the release of serotonin. 18F-FDG PET/CT, which <b>evaluate</b> <b>for</b> increased metabolism of glucose, may also aid in localizing the carcinoid lesion or <b>evaluating</b> <b>for</b> metastases. Chromogranin A and platelets serotonin are increased.|$|R
50|$|The {{clinical}} tests used {{to determine}} if the glossopharyngeal nerve has been damaged include testing the gag reflex of the mouth, asking the patient to swallow or cough, and <b>evaluating</b> <b>for</b> speech impediments.

5|$|Intense {{tropical}} cyclones pose {{a particular}} observation challenge, {{as they are}} a dangerous oceanic phenomenon, and weather stations, being relatively sparse, are rarely available {{on the site of}} the storm itself. In general, surface observations are available only if the storm is passing over an island or a coastal area, or if there is a nearby ship. Real-time measurements are usually taken in the periphery of the cyclone, where conditions are less catastrophic and its true strength cannot be <b>evaluated.</b> <b>For</b> this reason, there are teams of meteorologists that move into the path of tropical cyclones to help evaluate their strength at the point of landfall.|$|E
5|$|He {{was buried}} at Forest Home Cemetery in Forest Park, Chicago. Upon hearing reports of Sebille's death, commanders in Korea {{did not think}} highly of Sebille's act, likening it to a kamikaze action. In spite of reluctance, Lieutenant Donald Bolt, the squadron's {{assistant}} awards officer, forwarded a citation of the event to Washington D.C. where Sebille would be <b>evaluated</b> <b>for</b> the Medal of Honor. Shortly after the incident, both Bolt and Sebille's second-in-command, Captain Robert Howell, were killed in separate combat engagements. A short obituary for Sebille appeared in Time Magazine after his death. The United States Air Force Academy also created a memorial to Sebille in Harmon Hall, the academy's administration building.|$|E
5|$|Starting in the 1980s, the Stinger and AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air {{missiles}} and the AGM-122 Sidearm anti-radiation missile were <b>evaluated</b> <b>for</b> use upon the AH-64. The Stinger was initially selected; the U.S. Army was also considering the Starstreak air-to-air missile. External fuel tanks {{can also be}} carried on the stub wings to increase range and mission time. The stub-wing pylons have mounting points for maintenance access; these mountings {{can be used to}} secure externally personnel for emergency transportation. Stinger missiles are often used on non-U.S. Apaches, as foreign forces do not have as many air superiority aircraft to control the skies. The AH-64E initially lacked the ability to use the Stinger to make room for self-defense equipment, but the capability was re-added following a South Korean demand.|$|E

5|$|The best bulls go to {{artificial}} insemination (AI) cooperatives where semen is taken. AI allows the wide distribution of a bulls' genetics {{to the benefit}} of more farmers. However, in order to guarantee their genetic qualities, the bulls are subject to a strict selection scheme to increase the accuracy of the different genetic indexes. The best bulls identified at Lanaud are sent to another test station at Naves in Corrèze. Here they are tested more accurately and <b>evaluated</b> <b>for</b> feed conversion efficiency, growth and muscle development. Progeny of the top 10 bulls out of this testing, and the best natural service bulls, are then evaluated. Cows are inseminated to produce 60 to 80 calves per bull tested, which are in turn evaluated.|$|E
