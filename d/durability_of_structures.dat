40|$|Environment is the {{external}} factor {{that affects the}} <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> concrete <b>structures.</b> Buildings in different regions with different climates will respond to durability deterioration in different ways.

40|$|Experimental {{results show}} that soy methyl ester (SME), a {{derivative}} of soy bean oil, along with the incorporation of polystyrene (PS) is a non-toxic, biodegradable and renewable material {{that can be used}} effectively as a topical concrete surface treatment. While, concrete sealants and topical surface treatments can be used to extend to <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> concrete <b>structures,</b> it is difficult to predict the <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> concrete <b>structures</b> sealed with a sealant or topical surface treatment. This is {{due to a lack of}} necessary model inputs that can be used to address the <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> concrete <b>structures</b> treated with these materials. In general, this thesis expands upon previous research in exploring the use of SME-PS blends as a topical treatment used to enhance concrete durability and presents a sound theoretical framework for modeling the <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> concrete <b>structures</b> topically treated with SME-PS using Fick’s 2 nd Law of diffusion. Using experimental data generated in this study, fluid transport tests have been carried out to investigate how SME-PS changes fluid absorption and chloride ingress into concrete. The {{results show that}} the diffusion of chloride ions into concrete treated with SME-PS can be modeled by using a fractional amount (in this case 60 % is recommended) of the value of Cs that is used for conventional concrete when Fick 2 nd Law is used. This is critically important from a design and cost prospective, since tests do not need to be conducted with SME-PS to determine the benefits of surface treatment. ...|$|R
