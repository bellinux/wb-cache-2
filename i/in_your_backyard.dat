50|$|The name, Die Wasgoedlyn (The Washing Line), {{was chosen}} for two reasons. The first being that a washing line (in literal terms) is not usually {{a place where you}} would take your guests. It is usually <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>backyard</b> where things are a lot less presentable than the front (street view) of your house. In the same vain Die Wasgoedlyn {{attempts}} to unearth these raw performances of artists in a space (mentally and physically) that they take comfort in - in which {{they do not have to}} pretend. The second reason is that on a washing line you'll find a large variety of items, from work-shirts to church-blouses, patched socks, vest with holes in it, underwear from Jockey, petticoats, etc. Die Wasgoedlyn is as much about putting the artist in their most natural surrounding as it is about surrounding them with other artists - enabling the somewhat mystical bond between creatives to flourish resulting in instinctive collaborations.|$|E
5000|$|Merullo’s {{early works}} have been termed {{thoughtful}} and reflective. [...] "I think I am {{a person who}} cares about the emotional life of people...and so I {{spend a lot of time}} on the emotional experiences of my characters—rather than, say, their intellectual experiences," [...] he once said. [...] But, Golfing with God, Breakfast with Buddha and American Savior exhibited a more overtly spiritual theme - albeit humorous in tone. The seeds of this thematic shift can perhaps be traced to A Little Love Story. However, in the fall of 2008, Merullo surprised many with the release of Fidel’s Last Days, his first thriller. Merullo has addressed these changes saying, [...] "...I've had editors counsel me to write the same book over and over, and some readers who complained that I haven’t kept writing books set in greater Boston. But it would be like trying to keep a migratory bird <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>backyard.</b> I just want to go places, to see things, to observe the human predicament in different forms...

40|$|Why {{are there}} {{sedimentary}} or igneous or metamorphic rocks <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>backyard?</b> What is the underlying geologic story {{that explains the}} shape of the world around you? The Teacher-Friendly Regional Geology Guides provide teachers with the tools to incorporate regional and local geology into the classroom. Using geologic history as a framework, the Guides examine rocks, glaciers, fossils, topography, minerals, non-mineral resources, and environmental issues of the region. The Guides use non-technical language, intuitive graphics for use in the classroom, provide corresponding student activities for each topic, and have a compilation of Earth science resource information listed by state and topic. This is not a curriculum, but rather a source to incorporate ideas from the Guides into your own existing curriculum. The Guide is organized historically because regional history is responsible for and makes sense of rocks at the surface, topography and other regional geologic patterns. The Guides are intended {{to make sense of the}} detail of regional geology and provide the tools to understand your local geology. The Teacher-Friendly Regional Geology Guides are invaluable to anyone who incorporates Earth science into their curriculum, from elementary school through college.

Prior to the album's release, the band performed at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, where they were named by Rolling Stone magazine {{as one of the}} 25 [...] "can't-miss acts" [...] of the festival.

40|$|Birds {{capture the}} {{imagination}} of homeowners {{from all walks of}} life. A glance out a window during fall or spring may reveal a pinstriped blackpoll warbler busily feeding during a break from migratory flights that take it to places as far away as the boreal forests of Canada or the mountain forests of South America. Lifeless and cold winter days may be enhanced by the company of a flock of chickadees. A morning on the back porch may turn into a front seat for the first attempts at flight by recently hatched robins. Backyard habitats are important resources for many birds, and homeowners can take actions to increase the attractiveness of their yard for birds. Additionally, the same practices deemed desirable by birds can increase property values, improve aesthetics, help conserve energy costs with shade or insulation from strong winds, reduce the abundance of certain insect pests, and provide an enriching experience to observe and learn about the birds <b>in</b> <b>your</b> own <b>backyard.</b> This publication explores those practices and offers guidance on making the most of your yard for wildlife.
