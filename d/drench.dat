5|$|Donaldson {{returned}} from his suspension for York's reserves against Sheffield United on 6 February 2007, but the match was frozen off, and he eventually returned in a 4–0 away win over Altrincham on 10 February 2007. His first goals since his suspension came against Cambridge United, with a hat-trick on 13 March 2007. Donaldson insisted he remained fully committed to York, after speculation concerning his commitment grew in April 2007. In the play-off semi-final second leg away to Morecambe on 7 May 2007, Donaldson collided with the onrushing opposition goalkeeper Steven <b>Drench</b> in the penalty area while trying to collect the ball. With Donaldson still groggy, York's penalty was taken by Steve Bowey, who successfully converted in the 20th minute. However, York lost the match 2–1 and were eliminated on aggregate. Donaldson finished 2006–07 with 26 goals for York from 48 appearances, including 24 goals in the Conference National, meaning he was the division's third top scorer.|$|E
5|$|Han {{farmers in}} the Yangzi River region of {{southern}} China often maintained paddy fields for growing rice. Every year, they would burn the weeds in the paddy field, <b>drench</b> it in water, sow rice by hand, and around harvest time cut the surviving weeds and drown them a second time. In this system, the field lays fallow {{for much of the}} year and thus did not remain very fertile. However, Han rice farmers to the north around the Huai River practiced the more advanced system of transplantation. In this system, individual plants were given intensive care (perhaps in the same location as the paddy field), their offshoots separated so that more water could be conserved, and the field could be heavily fertilized since winter crops were grown while the rice seedlings were situated nearby in a plant nursery.|$|E

40|$|Twelve soil <b>drenches</b> over {{a period}} of 30 days with DBCP {{concentrations}} of 40 μg/ml did not completely prevent infection of tomato plants by root-knot nematode juveniles.

40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2016. Includes bibliographical references. Vermicompost tea (VCT), a {{water extract}} of vermicompost (VC), has been {{documented}} to suppress several soil-borne pathogens as well as plant-parasitic nematodes (PPNs). Previous research has not showed consistent performance of VCT for suppressing PPNs. Several factors affect the performance of VCT for PPNs suppression. This thesis focused on studying potential factors affecting the VCT in suppression of PPNs and understanding some mechanisms involved in PPNs suppression by VCT. Specific objectives of this thesis were 1) determining the effects of VCT prepared from different curing ages of VC on penetration, reproduction and hatch of Meloidogyne spp., root-knot nematodes (RKs), 2) determining the effective VCT <b>drenching</b> frequency for suppression of RKs, and enhancement of free-living nematodes in a cucumber agroecosystem, and 3) determining if VCT <b>drenching</b> could induces host plant resistance on cucumber (Cucumis sativus). Three greenhouse trials showed that VCT prepared from uncured and partially cured (cured for 1 - 1. 5 months) VC consistently reduced root penetration and hatch of M. incognita at 1 and 2 weeks after VCT treatment, respectively. However, VCT <b>drenching</b> did not suppress M. incognita reproduction on tomato (Solanum lycopersicon) and cucumber in longer-term greenhouse trials (2. 5 months) despite repeated <b>drenching</b> at 2 -week interval. Thus {{the next logical step}} was to evaluate <b>drenching</b> frequency for effective management of PPNs in the field. Two cucumber field trials were conducted to examine the <b>drenching</b> frequency of VCT in conjunction with a pre-plant nematode management technique, of a oil radish (Raphanus sativus) cover crop. VCT <b>drenching</b> at 1 -week intervals consistently reduced the abundance of RKs in both trials, but oil radish only suppressed the abundance of RKs in Trial II. Weekly VCT <b>drenching</b> also increased abundance of bacterivorous nematodes in Trial I (P < 0. 05), indicating an enhancement of bacteria decomposition. VCT <b>drenching</b> could further improve soil health when integrated with oil radish cover crop as indicated by higher nematode richness and abundance of Ecumenicus, an omnivorous nematode. However, this effect of VCT on soil health was not obvious in Trial II. Weather conditions might {{play a role in the}} inconsistent performance of VCT <b>drenching</b> on soil health. Although VCT <b>drenching</b> had no effect on cucumber yield, oil radish cover crop consistently increased cucumber yield. Thus, integration of VCT <b>drenching</b> with oil radish cover cropping could offer an economical nematode management practice. To understand the mechanism on how VCT prepared from uncured VC suppress PPNs, split-root experiments and quantitative real time PCR were used to test the hypothesis on whether VCT <b>drenching</b> induced the expression of plant defense related genes. Split-root experiments showed that <b>drenching</b> VCT prepared from uncured VC on one side of the cucumber roots significantly suppressed root penetration of M. incognita on the other side of the roots compared to the water control (P < 0. 05). Plants <b>drenched</b> with VCT showed an increased expression of CHIT- 1 at 2 days after M. incognita inoculation, and increased expression of PAL- 1 at 2 and 8 days after M. incognita inoculation. VCT <b>drenching</b> resulted in up regulation of LOX- 1 at 2 and 5 days and down regulation of PR 1 at 5 and 8 d after M. incognita inoculation. CHIT- 1, PAL- 1 and LOX- 1 were known to be involved in Induce Systemic Resistance (ISR) on cucumber. Down regulation of PR 1 supporting the hypothesis that VCT did not induce Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR). This is the first study to demonstrate the ability of using VCT prepared from uncured VC as root <b>drenching</b> to induce ISR on cucumber. Although this induction of ISR was short lived, <b>drenching</b> VCT at a weekly interval could provide consistent suppression of root-knot nematodes for a cucumber crop. Thus, use of VCT prepared from an uncured VC is a viable post-plant nematode management tool against RK...|$|R

Shortly before the 2006–07 campaign, on 8 August 2006, Madjo joined newly promoted Conference National side Stafford Rangers. He was the first ever full-time player at Stafford Rangers.

He scored the winning goal in the club's following fixture, a 1–0 home win against Altrincham – firing the ball high into the net in the 81st minute after connecting with Dolapo Olaoye's cross. Madjo failed to find the net again until 10 October 2006, scoring in Stafford's 4–1 away win at Gravesend & Northfleet. Four days later, he was on hand to score the only goal of the game in the 8th minute in a 1–0 win victory against Woking, scoring from 18 yards out. A month later, Madjo scored his fourth goal of the 2006–07 campaign in a 3–1 defeat at Halifax Town, before scoring a week later in a 2–2 home draw against St Albans City. Madjo failed to find the scoresheet for two months, before scoring a consolation strike in a 3–1 home loss to Morecambe on 27 January 2007, with the visitors 3–0 up Madjo struck a [...] "superb 20-yard volley" [...] past Morecambe goalkeeper Steven <b>Drench.</b> He went a further nine games without a goal, ending his goal drought in a 4–2 win against Grays Athletic on 24 March 2007.

A brace away at Aldershot Town in a 4–2 defeat meant that Madjo had taken his goal tally into double figures, scoring two first-half goals with close range finishes. Madjo scored both goals in Stafford's 2–0 home win against Northwich Victoria on 17 April 2007, the win all but secured Stafford's Conference National status for another season.
