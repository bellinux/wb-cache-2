25|$|The {{wheel is}} usually {{similar to a}} bicycle wheel with a special hub {{designed}} so the axle is a fixed part of the hub. This means {{the rotation of the}} cranks directly controls the rotation of the wheel (called direct drive). The frame sits on top of the axle bearings, while the cranks attach {{to the ends of the}} axle, and the seatpost slides <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> to allow the saddle to be height adjusted.|$|E

25|$|The Bodeo was {{considered}} simple and robust. Due to the revolver being {{produced by a}} multitude of manufacturers, {{the quality of the}} weapon varied greatly. Frames were made {{from a wide variety of}} materials ranging from brass to brazed copper plates. The gate was connected to the hammer with the barrel screwed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame.</b> Ejection was achieved by the rod normally housed in the hollow axis pin. The hammer block was designed to prevent firing unless the trigger was fully cocked.|$|E
25|$|When Bourke {{asked about}} the popular account of the guard bayoneting Crazy Horse first, Little Big Man said that the guard had thrust with his bayonet, but that Crazy Horse's struggles {{resulted}} in the guard's thrust missing entirely and lodging his bayonet <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> of the guardhouse door. Little Big Man {{said that in the}} hours immediately following Crazy Horse's wounding, the camp commander had suggested the story of the guard being responsible to hide Little Big Man's role in the death of Crazy Horse and avoid any inter-clan reprisals.|$|E
25|$|Royal Mail {{is famous}} for its custom {{load-carrying}} bicycles (with the rack and basket built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame),</b> made by Pashley Cycles since 1971. Since 2000, old delivery bicycles have been shipped to Africa by the charity Re~Cycle; over 8,000 had been donated by 2004. In 2009, Royal Mail announced it was beginning to phase out bicycle deliveries, to be replaced with more push-trolleys and vans. A spokesman said that they would continue to use bicycles on some rural routes, {{and that there was no}} plan to phase out bicycles completely.|$|E

50|$|While {{the exact}} {{mechanics}} of a forwarding table is implementation-specific, the general model is that frame relay switches have statically defined forwarding tables, one per interface.

25|$|But Steinschneider's {{assumption}} {{can hardly}} be supported. The Mishnat ha-Middot has {{nothing in common with}} the Baraita cited by the old scholars under that name: for the citations leave no doubt that the Baraita, even in its mathematical parts, was founded on the Bible; whereas the Mishnat ha-Middot is a purely secular work, and, possibly, it drew upon the same source as did Mohammed b. Musa, the oldest Arabic mathematician. The plea that the Mishnat ha-Middot has not been preserved in its entirety, and that in its original form there were references to the Bible for special points, is of no weight, since it is absolutely incomprehensible that haggadic or halakic matter should fit <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> of the work as it now is.|$|E
25|$|The Goth versus Gael debate {{centred on}} {{which part of}} Scotland's past is the more important, the Germanic or the Celtic. Germanicists, or Gothicists as they are {{sometimes}} called, attempted to disassociate Gaels and Gaelic from the Scottish past. One extreme example was John Pinkerton, who believed passionately that the people and language of lowland Scotland derived from a Gothic dialect spoken by the Picts. John Pinkerton even invented ancient tales to give substance to this fictional ancient people. The main thrust of the Germanicist model was destroyed {{in the nineteenth century}} when William Forbes Skene and others brought medieval Scotland <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> of serious, recognisably modern scholarship. Nevertheless, this model has had a lot of impact on popular understandings of medieval Scottish history. It explains, for instance, why some popular historians believe that English became the language of Lowland Scotland in the reign of Malcolm III, owing to the influence of his wife, the Anglo-Hungarian Saint Margaret, when in fact no such thing happened for another few centuries.|$|E

25|$|Anthony {{commuted}} to Towson Catholic High School for {{his first}} three years of high school. During the summer of 1999, Anthony grew five inches <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> of a 6–5 swingman. He suddenly became one of the area's top players and {{made a name for himself}} in the area, being named The Baltimore Suns metro player of the year in 2001, as well as Baltimore Catholic League player of the year. During his sophomore year, he averaged 14 points, 5 rebounds, 4 assists and 2 steals. Towson Catholic surged to a record of 26–3 and finished third in the state tournament. Anthony enjoyed a successful high school basketball career as a junior, almost doubling his numbers in scoring and rebounds, averaging 23 points and 10.3 rebounds. Despite his successful year, Anthony was distracted by all of the attention, and was suspended on several occasions for skipping classes. He barely registered a blip on the radars of pro scouts with his skinny frame and lack of strength; many scouts felt that he was not ready for the physical demands of the NBA. In the end, Towson Catholic fell short of the state title, although he was named Baltimore's County Player of the Year, All-Metropolitan Player of the Year and Baltimore Catholic League Player of the Year.|$|E
25|$|The Glock's frame, {{magazine}} body, {{and several}} other components are made from a high-strength nylon-based polymer invented by Gaston Glock, called Polymer 2. This plastic was specially formulated to provide increased durability and is more resilient than carbon steel and most steel alloys. Polymer 2 is resistant to shock, caustic liquids, and temperature extremes where traditional steel/alloy frames would warp and become brittle. The injection-molded frame contains four hardened steel guide rails for the slide: two {{at the rear of}} the frame, and the remaining pair above and in front of the trigger guard. The trigger guard itself is squared off at the front and checkered. The grip has an angle of 109° and a nonslip, stippled surface on the sides and both the front and rear straps. The frame houses the locking block, which is an investment casting that engages a 45° camming surface on the barrel's lower camming lug. It is retained in the frame by a steel axis pin that holds the trigger and slide catch. The trigger housing is held to the frame by means of a polymer pin. A spring-loaded sheet-metal pressing serves as the slide catch, which is secured from unintentional manipulation by a raised guard molded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E

Roger Ebert gave the film 1 star out of 4 and said that it [...] "takes the tepid achievement of Twilight, guts it, and leaves it for undead."
