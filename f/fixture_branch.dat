40|$|High-rise and super-high-rise {{commercial}} buildings produce {{large amounts of}} waste from their kitchens on a daily basis. These {{commercial buildings}} produce so much more waste than apartment buildings that waste recycling and conversion of biomass into energy are much expected to bring positive solutions, and in realising these solutions, it is also effective to apply drainage systems with a disposer. This paper discusses the issues that come along {{with the introduction of}} drainage systems with a commercial disposer to actual commercial buildings; the drainage/carrying performance of drainage stack systems and cleaning performance of pipeworks, by experimenting on a high-rise experimental drainage tower system. To be more precise, the study intends to learn about how the pipe pressure fluctuates when drainage loads are applied from upper floors, how kitchen waste is carried through the horizontal <b>fixture</b> <b>branch</b> and, how effectively pipes are cleaned when using a high-pressure cleaning method...|$|E

There are {{requirements for the}} minimum number of branches, and placement of receptacles, according to the location and purpose of the receptacle outlet. Ten important items in Article 210 have been summarized in a codebook.|$|R
40|$|We study 4 D N= 2 superconformal field {{theories}} that arise as the compactification of the six-dimensional (2, 0) theory of type E_ 6 on a punctured Riemann {{surface in the}} presence of Z_ 2 outer-automorphism twists. We explicitly carry out the classification of these theories in terms of three-punctured spheres and cylinders, and provide tables of properties of the Z_ 2 -twisted punctures. An expression is given for the superconformal index of a fixture with twisted punctures of type E_ 6, which we use to check our identifications. Several of our <b>fixtures</b> have Higgs <b>branches</b> which are isomorphic to instanton moduli spaces, and we find that S-dualities involving these fixtures imply interesting isomorphisms between hyperKÃ¤hler quotients of these spaces. Additionally, we find families of fixtures for which the Sommers-Achar group, which was previously a Coulomb branch concept, acts non-trivially on the Higgs branch operators.
