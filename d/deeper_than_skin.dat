Watch him: he does not make eye contact and his entire expression is extremely relaxed - you would think he is about to perform a ballet or something. But here is the crucial thing. When the referee tells them to head back to their corners, Fedor suddenly darts a short look directly at his opponent - or through his opponent, I should say. This kind of look is associated with antisocial behavioral disorders and psychopaths. They don't look at you, they look through you. It's emotionless; it goes <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> <b>skin</b> level. You will get a lot of fighters who will catch that look and suddenly realize they don't want to be there. Wanderlei Silva has a stare-down that makes you think 'this is gonna hurt', but Fedor's makes you think 'I might die'." ...|$|E

It 2 ̆ 7 s not some weird lipstick (she never wears lipstick), she didn 2 ̆ 7 t bump her lips or chew on ice. Her lips are just white. In a panic, she digs up an old lipstick and smears it on her colorless lips. But soon, more and more white spots begin to bloom, spreading their chalky tendrils across her olive brown skin. Does she have a disease? Is she turning into some kind of freak? Sep is usually the one who knows all the answers. With a quicksilver mind and a supple body, she 2 ̆ 7 s happiest when she 2 ̆ 7 s delving into the mysteries of animal biology or giving herself over to sweet, hot moves in Jazz Dance Club. Unlike her best friend, Devon, she 2 ̆ 7 s never been in a rush to get a boyfriend. But as the white blotches spread, her dating days, like the endangered species she studies, seem numbered. So when Josh, a boy she 2 ̆ 7 s always liked, makes a flirty advance, she wonders: why not grab pleasure while she can? Frank, funny, and full of passion, this compelling novel tells the empowering story of a strong, gifted teen who, as her life spins out of control, desperately tries to prove to the world, and herself, that she is <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> <b>skin...</b>|$|E

40|$|Small {{areas of}} the skin in the groin of mice were {{subjected}} to an erythema dose of x-rays and a week later a cancer graft was inoculated intracutaneously into the area {{and at the same}} time a like graft was inoculated in the same manner in the opposite groin protected from x-rays. The graft in the x-rayed area showed a low percentage of takes, while that in the normal skin gave the usual high percentage When the graft was introduced into the subcutaneous tissues it grew equally as well in the x-rayed area as in the protected area. Histological examination shows the skin layers, a few days after x-ray treatment, to be markedly infiltrated with round cells of the lymphoid type. The reaction did not extend <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> the <b>skin</b> layers. It is suggested that this local lymphoid reaction induced by the x-rays controls the graft made into the skin, while its absence in deeper tissues accounts for the growth of the grafts more deeply implanted...|$|R

He educated himself in this peculiar way for seven years, and people could not appreciate it. He was perpetually [...] "going Fantee" [...] among the natives, which, of course, no man with any sense believes in. He was initiated into the Sat Bhai at Allahabad once, {{when he was on}} leave; he knew the Lizard-Song of the Sansis, and the Halli- Hukk dance, which is a religious can-can of a startling kind. When a man knows who dances the Halli-Hukk, and how, and when, and where, he knows something to be proud of.

40|$|Psoriasis is an immune-mediated highly {{heterogeneous}} {{skin disease}} in which genetic {{as well as}} environmental factors play important roles. In spite of the local manifestations of the disease, psoriasis may progress to affect organs <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> the <b>skin.</b> These effects are documented by epidemiological studies, {{but they are not}} yet mechanistically understood. In order to provide insight into the systemic effects of psoriasis, we performed a nontargeted high-resolution LC-MS metabolomics analysis to measure plasma metabolites from individuals with mild or severe psoriasis as well as healthy controls. Additionally, the effects of the anti-TNFα drug Etanercept on metabolic profiles were investigated in patients with severe psoriasis. Our analyses identified significant psoriasis-associated perturbations in three metabolic pathways: (1) arginine and proline, (2) glycine, serine and threonine, and (3) alanine, aspartate, and glutamate. Etanercept treatment reversed the majority of psoriasis-associated trends in circulating metabolites, shifting the metabolic phenotypes of severe psoriasis toward that of healthy controls. Circulating metabolite levels pre- and post-Etanercept treatment correlated with psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) clinical scoring (R(2) = 0. 80; p < 0. 0001). Although the responsible mechanism(s) are unclear, these results suggest that psoriasis severity-associated metabolic perturbations may stem from increased demand for collagen synthesis and keratinocyte hyperproliferation or potentially the incidence of cachexia. Data suggest that levels of circulating amino acids are useful for monitoring both the severity of disease as well as therapeutic response to anti-TNFα treatment...|$|R
40|$|Non-linear wave-plasma {{interactions}} in the plasma edge often set the operational limits for radio-frequency (RF) heating systems. Some peripheral Ion Cyclotron (IC) wave energy loss {{is attributed to}} a net direct current (DC) biasing of the edge plasma by RF-sheath rectification. In {{order to understand the}} underlying mechanisms driving these interactions, SSWICH (Selfconsistent Sheath and Wave for IC Heating) models self-consistently the interplay between RF wave propagation and edge plasma biasing, using a two-field fluid approach. RF and DC parts are coupled through non-linear RF and DC sheath boundary conditions (SBC). The iterative resolution of the coupled RF+DC model experiences convergence issues in the wide sheaths regime, i. e. large DC biasing relevant in the vicinity of high-power RF launchers. In order to overcome this difficulty and provide a first guess of the solution, the self-consistent RF+DC system was solved explicitly {{for the first time in}} this asymptotic wide sheaths limit, while keeping the possibility to excite the system by any realistic RF field map. Several original physical properties were observed. The radial penetration of the RF sheaths along lateral walls at both ends of the open magnetic field lines can be far <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> the <b>skin</b> depth characteristic of the slow wave (SW) evanescence. This is interpreted invoking the Sheath-Plasma Wave, only appearing in the presence of sheaths and carrying them along material boundaries up to their leading edge. The RF voltages driving sheaths were shown to scale as the square root of the input RF power, consistent with some experimental observations and valuable for antenna design. This is illustrated in the case of Tore Supra antennae by the comparison of two Faraday screens with different electrical design that were experimented upon last year simultaneously. Since only the edge plasma is actually meshed, another issue is the emulation of radiating conditions in order to avoid reflections at the inner boundary of the domain. A versatile perfectly matched layer (PML) adapted to any medium was thus developed and extensively tested as an artificial dielectric material. As tokamak magnetized plasmas present two wave eigenmodes with opposite group velocities, simultaneous adaptation is impossible. The PML is accordingly adapted only for the fast wave if the plasma domain is far thicker <b>than</b> the SW <b>skin</b> depth. The PML should also be placed beyond the coupling zone of the fast wav...|$|R
