5|$|Portia labiata is a <b>jumping</b> <b>spider</b> (family Salticidae) {{found in}} Sri Lanka, India, {{southern}} China, Burma (Myanmar), Malaysia, Singapore, Java, Sumatra and the Philippines. In this medium-sized <b>jumping</b> <b>spider,</b> the front part is orange-brown {{and the back}} part is brownish. The conspicuous main eyes provide vision more acute than a cat's {{during the day and}} 10times more acute than a dragonfly's, and this is essential in P. labiataâ€²s navigation, hunting and mating.|$|E
5|$|A few <b>jumping</b> <b>spider</b> species, {{including}} M. inclemens, {{have been}} able to establish themselves in man-made structures. Most often these spiders are found on outbuildings or structures such as fences, rather than in permanently inhabited houses.|$|E
5|$|When a Portia stalks another <b>jumping</b> <b>spider,</b> {{the prey}} {{generally}} faces the Portia and then either runs away or displays {{as it does}} to another member of its own species.|$|E
50|$|Adults mimic <b>jumping</b> <b>spiders,</b> one {{of their}} predators. In a {{recently}} conducted experiment, Brenthia hexaselena and Brenthia monolychna had higher survival rates than other similarly sized moths {{in the presence of}} <b>jumping</b> <b>spiders</b> and <b>jumping</b> <b>spiders</b> responded to Brenthia with territorial displays, indicating that the species were sometimes mistaken for <b>jumping</b> <b>spiders,</b> and not recognized as prey.|$|R
50|$|Epocilla is a genus of spiders in {{the family}} Salticidae (<b>jumping</b> <b>spiders).</b> These spiders are {{primarily}} natives of southeast Asia. As most <b>jumping</b> <b>spiders,</b> they hunt prey by jumping, secured to a location by a thread of silk.|$|R
50|$|Salticinae is a {{subfamily}} of <b>jumping</b> <b>spiders.</b> It includes over 90% of {{the known}} species of <b>jumping</b> <b>spiders.</b> The subfamily {{is divided into two}} unranked clades: Amycoida and Salticoida.|$|R
5|$|Although spiders are {{generally}} regarded as predatory, the <b>jumping</b> <b>spider</b> Bagheera kiplingi gets over 90% of its food from fairly solid plant material produced by acacias {{as part of a}} mutually beneficial relationship with a species of ant.|$|E
5|$|Portia fimbriata, {{sometimes}} called the fringed <b>jumping</b> <b>spider,</b> is a <b>jumping</b> <b>spider</b> (family Salticidae) found in Australia and Southeast Asia. Adult females have bodies 6.8 to 10.5millimetres long, while those of adult males are 5.2 to 6.5millimetres long. Both sexes have a generally dark brown carapace, reddish brown chelicerae ("fangs"), a brown underside, dark brown palps with white hairs, and dark brown abdomens with white spots on the upper side. Both sexes have fine, faint markings and soft fringes of hair, and the legs are spindly and fringed. However, specimens from New Guinea and Indonesia have orange-brown carapaces and yellowish abdomens. In all species of the genus Portia, the abdomen distends when the spider is well fed or producing eggs.|$|E
5|$|When {{stalking}} any non-salticid, P. fimbriata {{does not}} use cryptic stalking and does not consistently pull its palps back nor consistently freeze when faced by the prey. P. fimbriata adopts cryptic stalking only after recognizing prey as a <b>jumping</b> <b>spider.</b>|$|E
50|$|Rhetenor is {{a spider}} genus of the Salticidae family (<b>jumping</b> <b>spiders).</b> Spiders in this genus are beetle mimics.|$|R
5|$|While {{almost all}} <b>jumping</b> <b>spiders</b> are predators, mostly preying on insects, on other spiders, {{and on other}} arthropods, Phaeacius does not use the usual hunting tactics. Most <b>jumping</b> <b>spiders</b> walk {{throughout}} the day, so that they maximise their chances of a catch, and jump on their prey and then bite it. Unlike most <b>jumping</b> <b>spiders,</b> Phaeacius and other spartaeines do not leap on prey, but lunge from about half the predator's body length away.|$|R

5|$|Zygoballus sexpunctatus is {{a species}} of <b>jumping</b> <b>spider</b> which occurs in the southeastern United States {{where it can be}} found in a variety of grassy habitats. Adult spiders measure between 3 and 4.5mm in length. The {{cephalothorax}} and abdomen are bronze to black in color, with reddish brown or yellowish legs. The male has distinctive enlarged chelicerae (the mouthparts used for grasping prey) and front femora (the third, and typically largest, leg segments). Like many jumping spiders, Z. sexpunctatus males exhibit ritualized courtship and agonistic behavior.|$|E
5|$|Generally the <b>jumping</b> <b>spider</b> {{subfamily}} Spartaeinae, {{which includes}} the genus Portia, cannot discriminate objects at such long distances as the members of subfamilies Salticinae or Lyssomaninae can. However, members of Portia have vision about as acute as {{the best of the}} jumping spiders, for example: the salticine Mogrus neglectus can distinguish prey and conspecifics up to 320millimetres away (42times its own body length), while P. fimbriata can distinguish these up to 280millimetres (47times its own body length). The main eyes of a Portia can also identify features of the scenery up to 85times its own body length, which helps the spider to find detours.|$|E
5|$|P. fimbriata {{does not}} stalk at all {{species of the}} ant-mimic <b>jumping</b> <b>spider</b> genus Myrmarachne, and uses cryptic {{stalking}} only about 20% of the time against other ant-mimicking salticids and against beetle-mimicking salticids. P. fimbriata also sometimes does not use cryptic stalking against females of the salticid subfamily Lyssomaninae. These females are unusually translucent, and the translucent cuticle makes the anterior-median eyes (front-and-center) show light and dark regions that flicker in and out when viewed head on. Lyssomanine males are not translucent and do not produce this flickering, and P. fimbriata uses cryptic stalking consistently against the males. This suggests that the flickering anterior-median eyes of lyssomanine females may reduce the ability of P. fimbriata to identify these females as jumping spiders.|$|E

5|$|Females of the <b>jumping</b> <b>spider</b> Portia fimbriata have bodies 6.8 to 10.5millimetres long, {{while those}} of adult males are 5.2 to 6.5millimetres long. The Queensland variety is {{typically}} {{smaller than the}} Northern Territory variety. The cephalothorax is about 4millimetres long and 3millimetres wide, and the abdomen about 4millimetres long and 2.2millimetres wide. The front of the cephalothorax is large and angular, and the face is broad, high and flat. In Australia and Taiwan, both sexes have a generally dark brown carapace, reddish brown chelicerae ("jaws"), a brown underside, and dark brown palps with white hairs. Both sexes also have fine, faint markings and soft fringes of hair. However, the female has a white fringe just above the chelicerae, while the back half of the male's cephalothorax has a white band round the bottom edge and a white groove down the back. While male spiders' palps are larger than females', the palps of P.fimbriata females have a fringe of hair that makes them look about as larger as males'. The abdomens of both sexes are dark brown, with white spots on the upper side. Wanless' female from New Guinea has an orange carapace and chelicerae with sooty markings, palps mainly light yellow, legs orange-brown legs, and abdomen light yellow. Wanless also found a male from the Amboina area in Indonesia, showing an orange-brown carapace and chelicerae, yellow-brown to orange-brown palps, orange-brown legs and a light yellowish abdomen.|$|E

25|$|Most {{species of}} <b>jumping</b> <b>spiders</b> {{appear to be}} cursorial (adapted to run), {{allowing}} them to hunt insects without using webs. However, species of the genus Portia prefer to hunt other spiders, often invading their victims' webs.

25|$|Around Kenya's Kisumi at the Equator, P. africana {{lives on}} level ground about 1,400metres {{above sea level}} {{where there is no}} dry season, and inhabits open savanna {{containing}} clumps sisal and euphorbia.. There, P. africana appears in large, dense but localised populations of three species of <b>jumping</b> <b>spider,</b> all with bodies less than 5.0millimetres long.|$|E
25|$|Portia africana is a <b>jumping</b> <b>spider</b> (family Salticidae) {{found in}} Angola, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Gabon, Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, Zaire and Zambia.
