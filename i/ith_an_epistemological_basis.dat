40|$|Different ways {{by which}} we come to know something, are usefully applied to the {{pedagogy}} of medical education. Jürgen Habermas described three “ways” of knowing. These are empirical-analytic knowing (data collection), historical-hermeneutic knowing (understanding of meanings), and self-reflective critical knowing. These “ways” of knowing have <b>an</b> <b>epistemological</b> <b>basis,</b> which is able to be traced from the classical and medieval epochs of philosophical thought.

The beneficent action which follows, based upon self-reflection, and impelling the clinician to act as an agent of change, benefits both patients and clinicians. Understanding the importance of Habermas’ three “ways” of knowing, impels a re-balancing of undergraduate and post-graduate medical education curricula, which would foster a progression from empirical-analytic data collection, through historical-hermeneutic understanding of meanings, to self-reflective critical knowing as a life-long objective in clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} argumentations in proving discourses in {{mathematics}} classrooms. Examples {{of different types}} of argumentations that were observed in a comparative study of French and German lessons on the Pythagorean Theorem are presented. These illustrate different argumentations within two kinds of proving discourse. In one case the argumentation is characterised as intuitive-visual, and in the other as conceptual. It is suggested that there is <b>an</b> <b>epistemological</b> <b>basis</b> for the differences between these discourses and that comparative studies like this one provide a way to investigate these further. In this article two examples of argumentations are discussed: one in which one argues visually and the other in which one argues conceptually.

Such collective proving processes have received little attention in educational research to date, except in the work of Sekiguchi (1991) and Herbst (1998).

40|$|Rudolf Virchow's {{teaching}} was challenged by German physicians in the 1920 s. Scientific medicine, they argued, {{did not provide}} sufficient tools for patient care. They held Virchow responsible for this state of things. According to Ludolf von Krehl, Gustav von Bergmann or Ferdinand Sauerbruch, Virchow fostered a mechanistic trend in medicine which neglected the human dimension in medical practice. These clinicians claimed that scientific medicine should therefore be complemented at the bedside by a teleological approach, {{taking into account the}} purposiveness of vital processes. This was the methodological core of the reform that they intended to promote. Many pathologists alike were preoccupied with the reformatory trend launched by the physicians. Ludwig Aschoff, Paul Ernst, Max Borst and Walter Pagel endeavoured to reform the theoretical foundations of their discipline. However, they did not agree with the physicians' view of Virchow's teaching.

Beginning with <b>an</b> <b>epistemological</b> <b>basis</b> which is concretely constructivist and which views genres as cognitive concepts, Siegfried J. Schmidt, Helmut Hauptmeier and Gebhard Rusch, among others, take as their starting point the idea of ‘schema’, which is related closely to those of ‘frame’, ‘script’ and ‘plan’, and they define them epistemologically as elements which belong to the class of the cognitive schemata for the construction and the intersubjective establishment of reality. The social domain of acting in which genres, within this point of view, fulfill their role is the domain of interactive behavior responsible for constructing and intersubjectively establishing realities through the different existing communication media. For this reason, they too may be considered as schemata of communicative behavior (“media-action-schemata”), comprising all the necessary cognitive instruments for the construction of constants or invariants on the part of those who intervene in the processes of communication...|$|R

The epistemological differences however between the nature of science (NOS) and nature of {{indigenous knowledge}} (NOIK) constitute a major challenge for an inclusive IK-science curriculum integration. This article is about the application of <b>a</b> truth-based <b>epistemological</b> framework designed to support teachers to make decisions on how specific pieces of indigenous knowledge (local traditional practices and technologies) may be included in science lessons. First, an attempt was made to develop <b>a</b> truth-based <b>epistemological</b> framework for identifying epistemology(ies) of indigenous knowledge and practices. Second a group of science teachers used the truth-based epistemological framework to examine ways in which some specified IK practices that comprised a coherent set of knowledge themes on health, agriculture and technology could be integrated into the school science curriculum in a valid and legitimate way. The IK practices used in the study were systematically identified and documented by means of personal observations and interviews of key informants in a rural community in Zimbabwe.

40|$|Abstract An {{epistemological}} and discursive divide separates {{critics of}} GIS and its researchers. An assumption exists among many users and developers of GIS {{that the technology}} models reality and can thus be used to predict and explain spatial processes. This realist position is not sanctioned by social science critics of GIS who have focused efforts on illustrating the social effects of technology {{as well as social}} influences on its development. In this paper, I attempt to mediate these positions by arguing that GIS is shaped by social parameters, but that this does not necessarily negate its value in modelling spatial processes. Emphasis exclusively on either realist results or social influences in GIS deny evidence of their reciprocal effect. GIS and other technologies are shaped by social factors, but these are not the sole influences and don’t necessarily compromise the predictive value of GIS. A more constructive exercise is to “map ” points of social influence in order to demonstrate points where future negotiation can take place. Three examples of social influence are analyzed: (i) model building; (ii) algorithmic solutions for line intersection; and (iii) generalization research. These examples provide a preliminary blueprint for detecting social effects on the technology, a map that can be used by both developers and critics for reconstructing GIS. Moreover, the blueprint provides <b>an</b> <b>epistemological</b> <b>basis</b> for collaboration between geographers concerned with social influences in GIS as well as those engaged in its technical development...|$|R
40|$|The {{proposal}} of ecofeminist theology tries to give {{answers to the}} questions posed by the hermeneutics of gender and ecology regarding knowledge: how is it that we know, and where is it that we place ourselves in order to know? How can we experience this criterion of truth in the daily life of poor women of the 'third world'? How is it that a 'certain form of knowledge' has been used as an instrument of domination and exclusion of women and ecosystems? The answer proposed by ecofeminist theology is ecosophy (the wisdom of the oikós). Ecosophy is a form of knowledge derived from the experiences of ancestral Mesoamerican indigenous peoples, which is based upon equilibrium, fluidity, integration of the senses and corporality.. These elements are proposed as the starting point for the reflection of the ecofeminist theology,ethics, and spirituality. Ecosophy is characterized by being relational, inclusive, starting from corporal experience, integrating affectivity, by being sustained in interdependence and interconnectivity. It is not only a 'traditional wisdom' but it is also <b>an</b> <b>epistemological</b> <b>basis</b> that can reconstruct symbols and rites in a different way from western logic: 1) It deconstructs the epistemological model that make an understanding of human knowledge as masculine possible; 2) it deconstructs the knowledge that makes a centralising monotheism possible; 3) it upholds the immanence of God from a panentheistic theological reflection.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the nature of, {{the relationship between}} salvation, knowledge and faith {{in the specific context}} of Christian theology. It seeks to establish <b>an</b> <b>epistemological</b> <b>basis</b> for the Christian message of salvation in a culture which since the time of the Enlightenment has been highly sceptical of religious claims. This study begins with a critique of the theology of Emil Brunner. It accepts two of his theological premises; that human reason and philosophy cannot prove the truth of salvation, and that the salvation of which Christianity speaks does not address humanity like a bolt from the blue as some groundless revelation but {{on the basis of a}} point of contact between man and God, which allows humanity to recognise the salvific event. The distinction Brunner draws between 'personal' knowledge as an encounter between subjects, and 'objective' knowledge which is the construct of human reason enables him to speak of revelation in an unusual and original way. According to this thesis Christian revelation is at the same time rationally and 'personally' comprehensible, and yet not capable of being deduced or verified by human reason. However closer investigation reveals that Brunner's exposition of the incarnation as the 'personal' self-revelation of God within history is not coherent in itself. His understanding of both the 'personal' and the 'historical' is not so much derived from a natural understanding of personality and history, but rather from a use of those terms as defined by, an understanding of revelation which contains implicit within it the groundlessness and the 'alien' nature of revelation which, he sought to avoid. It is the contention of this thesis that in spite of Brunner's failure it is possible to use his basic categories of the 'historical' and the 'personal' to speak of salvation as the, confirmation within history of human 'personal' worth. This worth is ultimately indescribable and inexplicable in the categories of a contingent and finite world, and, as such, is open to a transcendent confirmation and validation. The Christian tradition, itself rooted in the tradition of Judaism, bears witness, like Judaism, to the experience of such a 'personal' validation and vindication. In this sense, therefore, the resurrection of Jesus, while offering no historical 'proof of the truth' on account of its essentially 'personal' nature, can be seen as <b>a</b> legitimate <b>epistemological</b> <b>basis</b> for <b>an</b> understanding of salvation, which still preserves the primacy of faith. However the focus upon the category of salvation, and salvation as <b>an</b> <b>epistemological</b> touchstone, reveals that the resurrection of Jesus confirms not so much the traditional distinctive Christological ontology, but rather a more all-embracing ontology of the gracious transcendence of love itself which resists the narrow and distinctive definitions of orthodoxy. In fact an epistemologically valid ontology of faith's activity in love allows the traditional ontologies of Christology, Soteriology and the Trinity to be seen as peripheral to a contemporary articulation of the Christian message of salvation on account of their dubious epistemological foundations...|$|R

A business process is intangible system that human beings make artifically to satisfy some goals. It is a human activity system [1].

Since {{a business}} process is artificail and contains human activities, the natural science cannot be directly applied to.

To do so, a conceptual variable is defined as any variable which can be defined by (a group of) researchers in a given setting. Such variables are classified. Sufficiency and ancillarity are defined conditionally on the context. The conditionality principle, the sufficiency principle and the likelihood principle are generalized, and a tentative rule for when one should not condition on an ancillary is motivated by examples. The theory {{is illustrated by the}} case where a nuisance parameter {{is a part of the}} context, and for this case, model reduction is motivated. Model reduction is discussed in general from the point of view that there exists a mathematical group acting upon the parameter space. It is shown that a natural extension of this discussion also gives a conceptual basis from which essential parts of the formalism of quantum mechanics can be derived. This implies <b>an</b> <b>epistemological</b> <b>basis</b> for quantum theory, a kind of basis that has also been advocated by part of the quantum foundation community in recent years.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{consider}} the potential that {{an analysis of the}} feminist-postmodernist debate in light of the linguistic tum may hold. To date, very few feminist theorists have directly engaged with the linguistic tum, even though this most recent revolution in philosophical thought has drastic implications for theory itself, and more importantly, for theory that seeks to influence or describe political engagement. In Chapter One, I begin by outlining the significance of the linguistic tum {{in the development of the}} postmodern agenda. I then explore the difficult terrain of the tense relationship between feminism and postmodernism in Chapter Two. Finally, in Chapter Three, I critically analyse the way in which viewing the feminist-postmodernist debate in light of the imperatives of the linguistic turn can help to ease the tensions that have clouded this relationship from its very outset. By examining three major aspects of postmodernism upon which feminist theorists concentrate - the subject, history, and metaphysics - I attempt to locate where each theorist is positioned in relation to both the linguistic tum and postmodernism. I conclude that, even though contemporary feminist theory works within the horizon of the linguistic tum, many feminist theorists have not embraced the imperatives that come along with it. Indeed, many feminist theorists who advocate an alliance with postmodernism, still retain vestiges of representational knowledge within their philosophical systems, which is incompatible with taking the linguistic tum. I end by considering the epistemological options that are available after the demise of the episteme of representation, arguing that any feminist theory that seeks to influence or describe feminist political action, must maintain <b>an</b> <b>epistemological</b> <b>basis...</b>|$|R

In EL. LE 1, 2012, we gave <b>an</b> <b>epistemological</b> <b>basis</b> for this idea of language education. In this issue we focus our attention on the human components of the teaching process, the teacher and the students, seen from the humanistic perspective, which assumes that human beings are governed by reason and emotion, and that both are important to understand what and why they act the way they do. The role of the students’ emotions in language acquisition has been studied for the last 20 years and has produced a considerable amount of literature, whilst the role of the teacher’s emotions has been very rarely considered – yet a teacher is a person, and he or she is an emotional being like his or her students. This dual perspective is the contribution of this essay – and of the Venetian school – to language education research. There is a second point worth mentioning: the emotional factor of both teacher and student is analyzed through the grid of factors defined by the cognitive theory of emotions, used so far only for the students’ side; yet the author goes back to the classics and assumes Plato’s classification of emotions as another grid to be considered in a discourse about the impact of emotions and their relationship to the rational side – and the classic perspective proves to be a highly productive one as far as language education is concerned...|$|R

The point of this working paper is to report teaching success and indicate potential merits of Lonergan’s general empirical method, grounded in insight-based critical realism, as <b>a</b> robust <b>epistemological</b> <b>basis</b> for EHEA university curriculum and instruction. The design approach to Lonergan’s method offers grounds to think it uniquely adapted for interdisciplinary social science in the complex trans-cultural, multi-lingual, and religiously pluralist EHEA, thus providing curriculum content adequate and appropriate for the “necessary European dimensions of higher education...|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} 2 ̆ 2 {{psychological}} realism, 2 ̆ 2 influenced by American pragmatism and phenomenology, {{has evolved from}} James Gibson 2 ̆ 7 s ecological psychology of perception. Psychological realism analyzes the interaction between persons and environments, each being defined {{only in terms of}} the other. For the literary critic, psychological realism can provide <b>an</b> <b>epistemological</b> <b>basis</b> for resolving <b>a</b> number of important issues raised by modern reader-oriented theories of interpretation. ^ A psychological-realist theory of reading can account for the indeterminacy of reader response and can also specify the constraints on interpretations imposed by the text. For psychological realism, meaning inheres in the interaction of the reader and the text and is not located in one of them alone. Psychological realism allows for multiple interpretations of a text while positing the existence of stable textual structures. ^ Part One of this dissertation summarizes the tenets of psychological realism advanced by James Gibson and applied to language by Robert Verbrugge and introduces a vocabulary that enables one to distinguish the roles of the reader, the text, and social and historical forces while accounting for their interpenetration in the reading process. ^ Part Two expands Verbrugge 2 ̆ 7 s adaptations of Gibson and develops a psychological-realist theory of reading that addresses literary concerns about such issues as how determinate and indeterminate structures in literary texts provide abstract instructions for readers, how the intentional quality of a text influences a reader 2 ̆ 7 s perception of it, and how styles of reading differ from naive to experienced readers. An analysis of the controversy over the ending of Huckleberry Finn, suggests how psychological realism might discriminate among interpretations. ^ Part Three compares the theories of Stanley Fish, Jonathan Culler, and Wolfgang Iser with psychological realism, focusing on the differences among their views of readers, texts, and historical influences on interpretation. ^ Part Four provides an example of psychological-realist methodology by analyzing the thirty-one interpolations of the 2 ̆ 2 Wandering Rocks 2 ̆ 2 episode of James Joyce 2 ̆ 7 s Ulysses. Interpolations are regarded as intersubjectively verifiable textual structures that provide specific abstract instructions for readers to connect discontinuous textual segments, but the determination of meaning is seen to depend on readers 2 ̆ 7 reading strategies and cognitive styles. ...|$|R
40|$|Measuring the {{performance}} of public services and programmes is now a generally accepted part of the scenery of public management. In practice, it is often honoured more in the breach than the observance owing to well-known technical and epistemological problems. In the absence of reliable performance data, normative assumptions may prevail on policy makers and managers alike which are at variance with objective reality. The critique and attempted reform of EU programme management is often based on such assumptions. This paper attempts to provide <b>an</b> empirical and <b>epistemological</b> <b>basis</b> to the judgment of EU programme management by identifying appropriate performance indicators, collecting data on them from audit reports over a 20 -year period and constructing a methodology for analysis. Criteria for reliable sources {{and the effect of}} intervening variables on the results are discussed. The paper reviews the evidence of the aggregate data collected for the five major EU spending areas, and suggests some conclusions questioning both commonly held assumptions about, and models for, the reform of EU programme management...|$|R
40|$|Systemic {{design is}} {{distinguished}} from user-oriented and service design practices in several key respects: The expansion and negotiation of system boundaries {{to frame the}} design situation, the intentional embrace of sociotechnical complexity, and strategies of systemic integration rather than market differentiation. Systemic design is concerned with higher-order socially-organized systems that encompass multiple subsystems in policy, organizational or product-service contexts. By integrating systems thinking and its methods, systemic design brings human-centered design to complex, multi-stakeholder service systems as those found in industrial networks, transportation, medicine and healthcare. It adapts from known design competencies - form and process reasoning, social and generative research methods, and sketching and visualization practices - to describe, map, propose and reconfigure complex services and systems. The recent development of systemic design as a research-based practice draws on long-held precedents in the system sciences toward representation of complex social and enterprise systems. A precedent article (Jones, 2014) established <b>an</b> axiomatic and <b>epistemological</b> <b>basis</b> for complementary principles shared between design reasoning and systems theory. The current paper aims to establish a basis for identifying shared methods (techne) and action practice (or phronesis) ...|$|R
