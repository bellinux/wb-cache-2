5|$|According to C.H.O'D. Alexander: This {{game was}} notable for two things. First, Fischer played the Queen's Gambit for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> {{in a serious}} game; second, he played it to perfection, the game indeed casting doubt on Black's whole opening system.|$|E
5|$|Ownership of the Brierfield {{plantation}} was {{embroiled in}} court cases, with {{the politics of}} the state judges playing a key role. Only after the Democrats took control of the state supreme court in 1881 did Davis, for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>life,</b> gain legal title.|$|E
5|$|Seward {{enjoyed his}} time in Georgia, where he was {{accepted}} as an adult for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> He was treated hospitably, but also witnessed the ill-treatment of slaves. Seward was persuaded to return to New York by his family, and did so in June 1819. As {{it was too late}} for him to graduate with his class, he studied law at an attorney's office in Goshen before returning to Union College, securing his degree with highest honors in June 1820.|$|E

5|$|At dawn, {{after his}} {{attacked}} failed to overtake any major positions, Zur decided to withdraw, for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> He ordered Harpaz's company, {{which had the}} most casualties, to go first, and at 06:00 told Dromi's company to follow. Harpaz's company had five men missing in action, four of whom were picked up by Dromi's people. One of Dromi's platoons remained {{on top of a}} sand dune to provide cover fire for the retreat. Meanwhile, the rest of the company made its way under the road and the railway through culverts. On the eastern side, Dromi met Harpaz. They sent the cover platoon home with the injured, and remained in their place to wait for Zur. Their lookout also spotted Kotzer's retreating company and Harpaz requested artillery cover using the only working communication device they had. The Napoleonchiks missed their targets, but deterred the Egyptians, who stopped following Kotzer.|$|E
5|$|Later, Scorpio {{has managed}} to capture a secret agent named Mr. Bont. Scorpio intends to have Bont killed with a laser, but Bont uses a coin to free himself from his {{restraints}} before attempting to flee. However, Homer, who is unaware of events, easily knocks him down, allowing Scorpio's soldiers to shoot the agent. A proud Scorpio happily thanks Homer for a job well done. At dinner, Homer proudly tells of his successes at work, but discovers that his family hates Cypress Creek and {{want to go back}} to Springfield. At first, Homer is opposed to this, saying that he has been doing a great job for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>life,</b> but nobody else is happy. Dejected, Homer decides to visit Scorpio back at Globex Headquarters. His visit coincides with an assault by the U.S. military, but Homer still remains oblivious to what is taking place. He finds Scorpio, explains the situation, and asks what to do. Scorpio advises Homer that he should do what is best for his family.|$|E
5|$|Shepstone had the Transvaal's {{annexation}} as a British territory formally {{announced in}} Pretoria on 12 April 1877. Burgers resigned {{and returned to}} the Cape to live in retirement—his last act as President was to announce the government's decision to send a deputation, headed by Kruger and Jorissen, to London to make an official protest. He exhorted the burghers not to attempt any kind of resistance to the British until these diplomats returned. Jorissen, one of the Dutch officials recently imported by Burgers, was included at Kruger's request because of his wide knowledge of European languages (Kruger was not confident in his English); a second Dutchman, Willem Eduard Bok, accompanied them as secretary. They left in May 1877, travelling first to Bloemfontein to confer with the Free State government, then on to Kimberley and Worcester, where the 51-year-old Kruger boarded a train for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> In Cape Town, where his German ancestor had landed 164 years before, he had his first sight of the sea.|$|E

5|$|Upon the queen's {{signing of}} the treaty, the French {{government}} deposed Rainilaiarivony from his position as Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, an elderly man named Rainitsimbazafy, was jointly selected by the French and Ranavalona as his replacement. The French ordered Rainilaiarivony to be exiled to French Algeria, although he initially remained in Antananarivo for several months after the treaty was signed. On 15 October 1895 {{the former prime minister}} was placed under house arrest and put under the guard of Senegalese soldiers at his home in Amboditsiry. On 6 February 1896, at the age of 68, Rainilaiarivony boarded a ship bound for Algiers and left his island for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> He was accompanied by his grandson, Ratelifera, as well as an interpreter and four servants. On 17 March 1896 the ship docked at the port of Algiers, where he would live out the few remaining months of his life.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Diệm {{had been}} the Interior Minister of Vietnam, serving under Emperor Bảo Đại. However, he {{resigned}} {{after a few months}} because the French colonial authorities would not give Vietnam any meaningful autonomy, and became a private citizen for the next decade. During World War II, Imperial Japan attacked Indochina and wrested control from France, but when they were defeated by the Allies in 1945, a power vacuum emerged. The communist-dominated Viet Minh of Ho Chi Minh proclaimed the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and fought for independence, while the French attempted to regain control of their colony, and created the State of Vietnam under Bảo Đại, which was an associated free state within the French Union. A staunch anti-communist nationalist, Diệm opposed both and attempted to create his own movement, with little success. With both the French and the communists hostile to him, Diệm felt unsafe and went into self-imposed exile in 1950, leaving Vietnam for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> He did so as the communists had sentenced him to death in absentia, while the French refused to give him protection, claiming that they had no resources. Diệm spent most of the next four years in the United States and Europe enlisting support, particularly among fellow Catholic politicians in America and Vatican officials. Diệm's success with the latter group was helped by the fact that his elder brother Ngô Đình Thục was the leading Catholic cleric in Vietnam and had studied with high-ranking priests in Rome.|$|E
5|$|In Prague, the {{emergence}} of Czech National Revival had increased the popularity and importance of the new Czech National Theatre, and had led to a downturn in the Royal Landstheater fortunes. Mahler's task was to help arrest this decline by offering high-quality productions of German opera. He enjoyed early success presenting works by Mozart and Wagner, composers with whom he would be particularly associated {{for the rest of}} his career, but his individualistic and increasingly autocratic conducting style led to friction, and a falling out with his more experienced fellow-conductor, Ludwig Slansky. During his 12 months in Prague he conducted 68 performances of 14 operas (12 titles were new in his repertory), and he also performed Beethoven's Ninth for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> By the end of the season, in July 1886, Mahler left Prague to take up his post at the Neues Stadttheater in Leipzig, where rivalry with his senior colleague Arthur Nikisch almost began at once. This conflict was primarily over how the two should share conducting duties for the theatre's new production of Wagner's Ring cycle. Nikisch's illness, from February to April 1887, meant that Mahler took charge of the whole cycle (except Götterdämmerung), and scored a resounding public success. This did not, however, win him popularity with the orchestra, who resented his dictatorial manner and heavy rehearsal schedules.|$|E

5|$|The Phantom brings Christine {{back down}} to his lair. Madame Giry shows Raoul where the Phantom lives, and he goes to rescue Christine. The Phantom forces Christine to don the wedding dress and once again professes his love, and orders Christine to marry him. Christine tries to {{convince}} the Phantom {{that she does not}} fear his ugliness, but rather his anger and willingness to kill to get what he wants. Just then, Raoul enters the lair, and the Phantom ties him to a gate and threatens to kill him if Christine refuses to marry him. Christine reflects over the impossible choice before passionately kissing the Phantom to show him he is not alone in the world. The Phantom is shocked from experiencing real human love for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> Ashamed of his murderous actions, he allows Christine and Raoul to leave and orders them to never return. He finds comfort in a little monkey music box. Christine approaches the Phantom, who tells her that he loves her, and she silently gives him the diamond ring from her finger to remember her by. After Christine and Raoul leave, the Phantom smashes every mirror in his underground lair and disappears through a secret passage behind a velvet curtain just before the police arrive. Upon entering, Meg finds only the Phantom's white mask.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of his retirement, Eden had been short of money, {{although}} he was paid a £100,000 advance for his memoirs by The Times, with any profit over this amount to be split between himself and the newspaper.

25|$|Domingo Ortega {{suffered}} an automobile accident, and his proxy, Dominguín, asked Sánchez {{to substitute for}} him in Manzanares, on 11 August 1934. This came at a bad time for Sánchez, but because the bulls were great {{he did not want}} to seem like he was avoiding them. He had no car, no hotel, not even a cuadrilla (bullfighting team). For the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>life,</b> he turned to the lottery and drew two tickets with the numbers of the bulls of Ayala that he was scheduled to fight. The first, number 16, Granadino, docile, thin-horned and coarse-skinned, nevertheless gored him.|$|E

Chávez was released by the Supreme Court of California on December 23, but the next day called a strike against six additional lettuce growers.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Paris, Brodovitch {{wanted to be}} a painter. A Russian white émigré in Paris, Brodovitch found himself poor and having to work for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> He took a job painting houses, while his wife Nina worked as a seamstress. They lived in a cheap, small apartment in the area of Montparnasse, among other Russian artists who had settled in Paris {{at the end of the}} 19th century. This group of artists, including Archipenko, Chagall, and Nathan Altman, would meet at the inexpensive Académie Vassilieff, which offered painting and sculpting classes without an instructor. His connections with these young Russian artists led to more artistic work as a painter of backdrops for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes.|$|E

Towards the climax of that book, Molly and Bill arrive at Hogwarts to see the Third Task of the Triwizard Tournament, acting as family guests to Harry. After the return of Voldemort, Dumbledore asks Molly and Bill to join the Order and fight in the impending Second War. Molly comforts Harry and, for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>life,</b> he has someone {{to be there for}} him, like a mother.|$|E
25|$|After {{that day}} of pleasantry, Gromyko for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> wanted to enter higher education, but without warning, Gromyko {{and his family}} were moved in 1954 to Moscow, {{settling}} in the northeastern Alexeyevsky District. In 1936, after another three years of studying economics, Gromyko became a researcher and lecturer at the Soviet Academy of Sciences. His area of expertise was the US economy, and he published several books on the subject. Gromyko assumed his new job would be a permanent one, but in 1939 he was called upon by a Central Committee Commission which selected new personnel to work in diplomacy. (The Great Purge of 1938 opened many positions in the diplomatic corps.) Gromyko recognised such familiar faces as Vyacheslav Molotov and Georgy Malenkov. A couple of days later he was transferred from the Academy of Sciences to the diplomatic service.|$|E
