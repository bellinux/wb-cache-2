50|$|<b>Grassroots</b> <b>sport</b> {{marketing}} {{is part of}} the field of marketing known as social marketing. This refers to marketing something that is of benefit to the public, and is normally done by government or charities rather than private sector organizations. It is normally done with a much smaller budget than marketing of sports teams and event or marketing of products through sports as it does not bring any direct financial benefit. Although this marketing normally drives people to clubs where they will pay to play sport it still needs to be subsidized in order to be run. The money therefore comes from local councils with a remit to increase participation or from public health sector which wants to decrease the cost of disease.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the global economic crisis on revenues on all non-governmental sport organizations (sport NGOs) in Slovenia, as a small European economy. Five types of operating revenues of all sport NGOs from 2007 to 2010 have been analyzed. We found that the overall trend of sport NGOs revenues does not correspond exactly to the trends of the Slovenian economy. The greatest financial impacts were experienced in <b>grassroots</b> <b>sport,</b> while professional sport NGOs have increased their operating revenues, mostly due to increases of public revenues. The findings suggest that the true impact of the recession on Slovenian sport NGOs remains to be seen. We conclude that the ongoing recession will affect <b>grassroots</b> <b>sport</b> the least, while semi-professional and professional sport NGOs will be under financial threat. Because of the synergistic effects of different types of NGOs, this could affect the sustainability of Slovenian sport...|$|E

40|$|Although {{confidence}} {{is one of}} the major contemporary concerns in the psychology of sporting performance, extant study has primarily been concerned with elite and/or individual sports, and a deductive framework has been dominant. Drawing upon the core techniques of Straussian Grounded Theory, the research reported in this paper inductively analyses detailed accounts of confidence-sourcing provided by N= 14 seasoned participants in amateur soccer. Results reveal a number of (sometimes eclectic) features of the ways that these individuals interpret and organise their own confidence sources, not least those relating to highly variable temporal and socio-spatial frames within which a potential confidence source might be considered “relevant” or “useful. ” These findings contrast significantly with others emanating from research in the elite domain and, it is contended, have direct practical implications for both physical educators and <b>grassroots</b> <b>sport</b> coaches...|$|E

We will argue that that system has been important in establishing a sound and cost-effective sporting infrastructure, perhaps favouring <b>grassroots</b> <b>sport</b> whilst not being blind to the significance of elite sports. We will also, however, go into the threats to the system, coming from the influx of commercial forces and the need to make difficult choices when it comes to elite sports...|$|E
