40|$|To {{clarify the}} effect of the {{ordinary}} and the brisk walking for 60 minutes intermitted by each 10 minutes on blood pressure and Accelerated Plethysmography (APG), eight young and nine <b>middle</b> <b>aged</b> persons served as the subjects. Results are summarized as the follows. 1) Walking velocity during the ordinary and the brisk walking were 83. 1 m/min and 122. 1 m/min <b>in</b> <b>the</b> young and 83. 3 m/min and 118. 2 m/min <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middled</b> <b>aged</b> persons respectively. There was {{no significant differences between the}} ordinary and brisk walking velocity both the young and the midle aged persons. 2) Heart rate during the ordinary and the brisk walking were 88. 4 ± 3. 5 beats/min (17. 4 ± 1. 770 f HRmaxreserve), 93. 9 ± 49. 3 beats/min (28. 2 ± 4. 5527777723260 f HRmaxreserve) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> young and 126. 1 ± 5. 5 beats/min (45. 1 ± 3. 6626662615000 f HRmaxreserve), 132. 2 ± 4. 8 beats/min (61. 7 ± 5. 0026662621600 f HRmaxreserve) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>aged</b> persons respectively. <b>The</b> brisk walking was significantly faster than the ordinary walking. 3) Systolic blood pressure during intermittent 60 minutes walking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ordinary and the brisk walking were 109. 1 ± 1. 4 mmHg and 126. 3 ± 3. 3 mmHg <b>in</b> <b>the</b> young and 136. 3 ± 9. 4 mmHg and 153. 2 ± 7. 5 mmHg <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>aged</b> persons respectively. Systolic blood pressure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brisk walking was significantly higher than <b>the</b> resting values <b>in</b> <b>the</b> both aged group. Diastolic blood pressure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ordinary and the brisk walking were 54. 13. 1 mmHg and 56. 8 ±mmHg <b>in</b> <b>the</b> young and 77. 1 ± 4. 3 mmHg and 72. 4 ± 5. 7 mmHg <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>aged</b> persons respectively. Diastolic blood pressure <b>In</b> <b>the</b> brisk walking was significantly lower than <b>the</b> resting values <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>aged</b> persons. 4) Accelerated Plethysmography (APG) at 10, 20 and 25 minutes after the brisk walking was significantly higher than resting values <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>aged</b> persons. 5) From above the mentioned, it may be concluded that the 60 minutes brisk walking intermitted by each 10 minutes is beneficial to improve peripheral circulation and to decline diastolic blood pressure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>aged</b> persons...|$|R
