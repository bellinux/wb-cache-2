Natasha {{wants to be}} a famous model, she loves to gossip and she knows how to get the boy's attentions.

I'm not a political commentator. So if I write a song that has political content, then hopefully that song is a good enough song to make it onto my record. And if it's not, then that's just a song that I've written. So I don't think it necessarily needs to be that you're definitively trying to make a political statement."

[...] Meester also expressed fondness for Dan and Blair, however, stating, [...] "I think they're good for each other <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>ways,</b> in a way that Chuck and Blair aren't."

500|$|... "Per Manum" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "good".

Despite this, VanDerWerff noted that the episode [...] "has some issues", largely due to the convoluted nature of the mythology {{at this point in the}} show's run, as well as the fact that Duchovny looked [...] "a little bored" [...] at times. However, he wrote that the episode, along with the subsequent episode [...] "This is Not Happening" [...] was a showcase for Anderson's acting ability, and her performance [...] "knits all of this together". Writing for Television Without Pity, Jessica Morgan rated the episode a [...] "B+", deriding some of the episode's plot points, such as the hospital's locking doors, and questioning the villainy of the antagonistic doctors.|$|E
500|$|Hail to the Thief's artwork {{was created}} by Stanley Donwood, who has created the artwork for every Radiohead release since The Bends. The cover art, titled [...] "Pacific Coast", is a road map of Hollywood with words and phrases taken from Los Angeles's {{roadside}} advertising, such as [...] "God", [...] "TV" [...] and [...] "oil", in place of buildings. Donwood said: [...] "Advertising {{is designed to be}} seductive and attractive and, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>ways,</b> it's very beautiful. But there's something unsettling about being continually sold something. I liked taking the elements of roadside advertising out of context because it removes the imperative and just goes to the essence of it – the pure heart of advertising." [...] Other words in the artwork were provided by Yorke, taken from political discussion surrounding the War on Terror. Among them is the phrase [...] "burn the witch", the title of song Radiohead worked on during the Hail to the Thief sessions but did not complete until their ninth album, A Moon Shaped Pool (2016).|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} moderately positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club gave the episode an A {{and called it}} [...] "generally a terrific episode". Handlen wrote that he was [...] "delighted to get another Scully-centric episode [...] one that doesn't end up with her looking pale and deathly in a hospital bed." [...] Despite his approval of the script, he slightly criticized the series for writing Scully-centric episodes {{based solely on the}} idea that [...] "something is being done to her" [...] as opposed to against or with her. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode an 8 out of 10, and wrote [...] "Overall, this episode was an interesting and uncommon in-depth look at Scully's psychology. The writers rarely had such an opportunity, and along with Gillian Anderson, they run with the opportunity. The religious metaphor is a bit thick throughout, but this is actually a bit more subtle than would become the norm. Making the child sick works for the mythology, but <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>ways,</b> it seems like a plot contrivance." ...|$|E

[...] Clearwater is a spiritual headquarters for the Scientology organization; when contacted for a statement by St. Petersburg Times, Kyle Jarrow responded, [...] "Wow!

500|$|Stead {{finds that}} kids today {{are much less}} {{independent}} since her childhood. She wrote, [...] "rom age nine, my friends and I were on the streets, walking home, going to each other's houses, going to the store. I really {{wanted to write about}} that: the independence that's a little bit scary but also a really positive thing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>ways.</b> And I'm not sure that most kids have that today". Throughout the novel, Miranda and her friends often walk around town without any adults. They are even found working in a sandwich store at lunch and walking home from school while trying to avoid the laughing man. While writing the novel, Stead hoped to show her sons the time period in which she lived, [...] "send them on a little time-travel journey of their own". Laura Miller of The New Yorker found that this lack of independence in today's youth is mainly {{due to the fact that}} kids now grow up with adults constantly watching them. Miller noted how, despite the lower crime rate in current times, the [...] "characters, middle-class middle school students, routinely walk around the Upper West Side by themselves, a rare freedom in today's city." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1999, Kunis {{replaced}} Lacey Chabert in {{the role}} of Meg Griffin on the animated sitcom Family Guy, created by Seth MacFarlane for Fox. Kunis won the role after auditions and a slight rewrite of the character, in part due to her performance on That '70s Show. When Kunis auditioned for the role, she was called back by MacFarlane, who instructed her to speak slower. He then told her to come back another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that she had it under control, MacFarlane hired her. MacFarlane added: [...] "What Mila Kunis brought to it was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>ways,</b> I thought, almost more right for the character. I say that Lacey did a phenomenal job, {{but there was something about}} Mila– something very natural about Mila. She was 15 when she started, so you were listening to a 15-year-old. Oftentimes with animation they'll have adult actors doing the voices of teenagers and they always sound like Saturday morning voices. They sound oftentimes very forced. She had a very natural quality to Meg that really made what we did with that character kind of really work." [...] Kunis was nominated for an Annie Award in the category of Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production in 2007. She also voiced Meg in the Family Guy Video Game!. Kunis described her character as [...] "the scapegoat." ...|$|E
500|$|The writing staff cited The Wizard of Oz as {{a source}} of {{thematic}} influence for Tron: Legacy in writing the script, with Kitsis stating that [...] "They both have very similar DNA, which is Tron really lives on, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>ways,</b> trying to get home. You're put on this world and you want to go home and what is home? That's in a lot of way inspired us." [...] Kitsis also added that they had to include an"emotional spine to take us into the story or else it just becomes a bunch of moves or gags and stuff", eventually deciding on adding a mysterious destiny to Flynn and giving him a legendary aura - [...] "Kevin Flynn to us was Steve Jobs and Bill Gates all wrapped up into one and John Lennon". The writers decided to create the character of Clu as an evil embodiment of [...] "how you look back on your younger self, (...) that guy [...] thought he knew everything, but he really knew nothing". Bridges liked the idea of the dual perspectives, and contributed with the writers for the characterization of Flynn as a sanguine Zen master by suggesting them to get inspiration from various Buddhist texts. Part of the concepts emerged from a reunion the producers had with scientists from California Institute of Technology and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to discuss concepts such as isomorphic algorithms and the digitizing of organic matter.|$|E
500|$|Attempts {{to produce}} an {{adaption}} of [...] "The Snow Queen" [...] in the Disney studio dated back to 1943, when Walt Disney considered collaborating with Samuel Goldwyn to produce a biography film of Hans Christian Andersen. However, the story and particularly the Snow Queen character proved to be too problematic to Disney and his animators. Namely one of the troubles they encountered was that the original story lacked necessary interaction between the main protagonist, Gerda (who later served as an inspiration for Anna), and the Snow Queen. Most obviously, Andersen's version did not feature any confrontation between them: when brave little Gerda enters the Snow Queen's ice castle and sheds her tears on Kay, the Snow Queen {{is nowhere to be}} seen. There just was not enough character conflict to form a full-length feature. Later on, Glen Keane, Paul and Gaëtan Brizzi, Harvey Fierstein, Dick Zondag and Dave Goetz were among other Disney executives to make efforts towards translating this potential material to the big screen, but none of them made their way. Around 2008, Chris Buck pitched Disney his version of The Snow Queen. At the time, the project was planned to be traditionally animated under the name of Anna and the Snow Queen. However, by early 2010, the project encountered the same problem and was stuck again. Jennifer Lee, Frozens co-director, later recalled, [...] "The issue with the original for us <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> is it's a very symbolic story. It's very hard to translate symbolism into concrete things. Film is concrete, so you translate it." ...|$|E

500|$|Shortz was {{the first}} guest star the {{producers}} of The Simpsons approached. Long later asked Reagle to make puzzles for the episode. Reagle recorded his lines in a studio near his home. Reagle told the Arizona Daily Wildcat that [...] "for me, {{to be such a}} total nut for animation since I was a kid, I never even dreamed [...] It's like a dream I never had coming true." [...] He added that [...] "you don't see [...] in the episode for very long, but when crossword fans watch this show, we want them to think that we got it right." [...] Reagle designed every puzzle that appears in the episode, including one that appears in a hopscotch court in Lisa's daydream. There were certain lines in the script that had to be incorporated into Reagle's puzzles, including one where Gil says [...] "I think I'll throw some Q's around,", and he enters a number of Q's onto the grid. Reagle therefore had to create a puzzle which used words that included the letter Q more frequently than would be usual. Reagle said he saw the early script of the episode, [...] "but they change it right up to the last minute. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>ways,</b> I'll be seeing {{it for the first time}} right along with everyone else."

Although he did not feel any sort of relationship with the character, he was enchanted by the dialogue structure, the way the writers [...] "brilliantly use those words that most of us don't recognize to create that rhythm.
