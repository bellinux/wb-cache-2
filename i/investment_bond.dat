40|$|This paper {{formally}} identifies {{an important}} role of banks: Banks competitively internalize production externalities and facilitate economic growth. I formulate a canonical growth model with externalities as a game among consumers, firms, and banks. Banks compete for deposits to seek monopoly profits, including externalities. Using loan contracts that specify price and quantity, banks control firms'' investments. Each bank forms a firm group endogenously and internalizes externalities directly within a firm group and indirectly across firm groups. This unique equilibrium requires a condition that separates competition for sources and uses of funds. I present a realistic institution that satisfies this condition.

40|$|Bond {{rating is}} one that should be {{considered}} by investors before making an <b>investment</b> <b>bond.</b> This is because bond rating provides an informative statement and provide signals about the probability of failure of a company's debt. In the bond rating process, rating agencies rate firms from various aspects, one of which is the company's financial data. Analysis of financial statements in the form of financial ratio analysis and statistical calculations can be used to detect an under or overvalued securities. Research on Indonesia's bond rating is still rare and research results have been found to show different results. Therefore, research should be repeated that test the ability of financial ratios in predicting bond ratings. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine empirically the influence of managerial ownership, institutional ownership, quality auditors, profitability, liquidity and leverage on bond ratings on publicly traded companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange.

40|$|Millions of Americans without {{insurance}} {{under the}} Affordable Care Act expansion {{fall into two}} categories: the ‘coverage gap’ and the ‘citizenship gap’. These two groups are disproportionately affected by health disparities due to low-income or legal status. Health disparities affect individuals in many aspects of their lives, including their health, finances, and overall quality of life. To {{improve the lives of}} uninsured individuals in Providence, Rhode Island Clínica Esperanza/Hope Clinic (CEHC) proposes to set up a Social <b>Investment</b> <b>Bond</b> Pay for Success program. CEHC has teamed with the Rhode Island Office of Health and Human Services and other RI organizations to coordinate this program, to be called, Bridging the Gap, which will enroll primarily Spanish speaking, low-income residents of Providence in continuity of care at the clinic and, in addition, nutrition education and lifestyle change programs. These patients will be followed as they transition to insured care, and the resulting reduction in the insured cost of care and health benefits (to the patients) will be measured and tracked. To prove that CEHC can successfully improve the health of our patients a feasibility assessment was performed (N= 41) to show the improved results of chronic care management and access to healthcare. Based on a comprehensive chart review, this cohort of patients improved their health measures from baseline to endpoint (average follow up 0. 5 - 5 years).
