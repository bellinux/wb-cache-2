25|$|Heine {{was more}} {{interested}} in studying history and literature than law. The university had engaged the famous literary critic and thinker August Wilhelm Schlegel as a lecturer and Heine heard <b>him</b> <b>talk</b> about the Nibelungenlied and Romanticism. Though he would later mock Schlegel, Heine found in him a sympathetic critic for his early verses. Heine began to acquire a reputation as a poet at Bonn. He also wrote two tragedies, Almansor and William Ratcliff, but they had little success in the theatre.|$|E

500|$|On October 27, 2003, Cher {{anonymously}} {{called a}} C-SPAN phone-in program to recount a visit she made to maimed soldiers at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center and criticized {{the lack of}} media coverage and government attention given to injured servicemen. She remarked that she watches C-SPAN every day. Although she identified herself as an unnamed entertainer, she was recognized by the C-SPAN host, who subsequently questioned her about her 1992 support for independent presidential candidate Ross Perot. She said, [...] "When I heard <b>him</b> <b>talk</b> right in the beginning, I thought that he would bring some sort of common-sense business approach and also less partisanship, but then... I was completely disappointed like everyone else when he just kind of cut and run {{and no one knew}} exactly why... Maybe he couldn't have withstood all the investigation that goes on now".|$|E

She also reunites with her younger brother, Kiddo (Rohit Saraf), who is the only other person besides her best friends that she is closest to.

500|$|In March 1599, Devereux {{was sent}} to defeat the growing {{rebellion}} in Ireland and was given command of 18,000men, but by November his army was reduced to 4,000, the rest [...] "frittered away" [...] in exchange for [...] " [...] nothing". On 5 June 1600 he faced a panel of Privy Councillors, judges {{and members of the}} nobility at York House, where he was charged with appointing generals without the Queen's permission, ignoring orders and negotiating [...] "very basely" [...] with the leader of the rebel forces. While the members of the nobility wished to be gentle with Devereux, the lawyers and judges felt differently, recommending fines and confinement in the Tower of London. In the end a compromise was reached, with Devereux put under house arrest and dismissed from all his government offices. Devereux immediately began plotting rebellion. Orders were sent out for [...] "bedding" [...] and [...] "draperies"– codenames for weapons– and rebellious gentlemen gathered at Essex House to hear <b>him</b> <b>talk</b> of Elizabeth's [...] "crooked mind and crooked carcass". In response, Coke and Cecil began a counter-plot. In 1599 Sir John Hayward had written and published The First Part of the Life and Raigne of King Henrie IV, dedicating it to Devereux. Elizabeth, furious, had banned the book, suggesting that it was a [...] "seditious prelude" [...] intended to show her as a corrupt and poor monarch. Against the backdrop of Devereux's plot, Coke and Cecil started a new investigation into the book, hoping to prove some involvement of Devereux in the publishing. Coke interviewed Hayward's licensing cleric, Samuel Harsnett, who complained that the dedication had been [...] "foisted" [...] on him by Devereux. In reaction, Coke decided to bring charges of treason against Devereux, saying that he had [...] "plotted and practised with the Pope and king of Spain for the deposing and selling of himself as well as the crown of England... His permitting underhand that treasonable book of Henry IV to be printed and published; it being plainly deciphered, not only by the matter, and by the epistle itself, for what end and for whose behalf it was made, but also the Earl himself being present so often at the playing thereof, and with great applause giving countenance to it".|$|E

A Unitarian minister named Cynthia Landrum responded, [...] "Listening to <b>him</b> <b>talk</b> about us over the years, it's {{becoming more and more}} evident that he isn't laughing with us — he's laughing at us", while Jeff Jacoby of the Boston Globe called Keillor [...] "cranky and intolerant".|$|E

[...] But my brother Mr. Gladstone came to see me in my lodge as a friend, and I was glad to see the White Chief, for though my tongue was tied in his {{presence}} my heart was in full friendship. [...] After he went away they told me that half of his great nation of white men have adopted him as their chief.

This is what he said: 'You vote by what you see'—as if black people don't know what they want to see.

Two months later, Dot is told by the police that Nick has died of respiratory failure from a heroin overdose the previous week. One of the police officers who breaks the news to Dot is Nick's son Charlie Cotton. Charlie explains that he was conceived from a brief marriage Nick had with his mother Yvonne back in the 1980s. During the funeral, Charlie and undertaker Les Coker prevent Dot from looking in the coffin. Dot is suspicious and invites Yvonne to tell the truth and she assures Dot that Charlie is her grandson. A few weeks later, Carol Jackson asks Charlie for advice, when he leaves his phone at her house, she answers a call and discovers that Nick is still alive. Following this, it is revealed that Charlie has been [...] impersonating a police officer and is actually a caretaker at a care home where Yvonne works. Charlie leaves work to find his car windows have been smashed, with a message from Nick, confirming he done it.|$|E
2500|$|Comey also {{testified that}} Ashcroft [...] "expressed himself in very strong terms." [...] Goldsmith testified that Ashcroft spoke {{at length about}} the legal issue. [...] "Attorney General Ashcroft… [...] a couple of minutes' speech {{in which he said}} that he…. shared the Justice department's concerns." [...] Although he was not present for the {{conversation}} between Gonzales and Ashcroft, FBI Director Bob Mueller testified, [...] "Ashcroft complained to Judge Gonzales about White House compartmentalization rules preventing Ashcroft from getting the advice he needed." [...] On July 24, 2007, Gonzales testified that he and Card were also concerned about Ashcroft's competency. [...] "Obviously there was concern about General Ashcroft's condition. [...] And we would not have sought nor did we intend to get any approval from General Ashcroft if in fact he wasn't fully competent to make the decision." [...] In response to a question from Senator Hatch, Gonzales continued, [...] "Obviously we were concerned about the condition of General Ashcroft. [...] We obviously knew he had been ill and had surgery. [...] And we never had any intent to ask anything of him if we did not feel that he was competent. [...] When we got there, I will just say that Mr. Ashcroft did most of the talking. [...] We were there maybe five minutes – five to six minutes. [...] Mr. Ashcroft talked about the legal issues in a lucid form, as I've heard <b>him</b> <b>talk</b> about legal issues in the White House.|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} the facts that Nat King Cole had the #7 song in 1959, and the #1 song in 1921, and Chuck Berry had a major hit with [...] "Maybellene" [...] in 1955, in the United States in the 1950s legal {{segregation}} and discrimination against African Americans was common, especially in the Deep South. Presley would nevertheless publicly cite his debt to African American music, pointing to artists such as B. B. King, Arthur [...] "Big Boy" [...] Crudup, Ivory Joe Hunter, and Fats Domino. The reporter who conducted Presley's first interview in New York City in 1956 noted that he named blues singers who [...] "obviously {{meant a lot to}} him. [...] was very surprised to hear <b>him</b> <b>talk</b> about the black performers down there and about how he tried to carry on their music." [...] Later that year in Charlotte, North Carolina, Presley was quoted as saying: [...] "The colored folks been singing it and playing it just like I’m doin' now, man, for more years than I know. They played it like that in their shanties and in their juke joints and nobody paid it no mind 'til I goosed it up. I got it from them. Down in Tupelo, Mississippi, I used to hear old Arthur Crudup bang his box the way I do now and I said if I ever got to a place I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw." [...] Little Richard said of Presley: [...] "He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. He opened the door for black music." [...] B. B. King said he began to respect Presley after he did Arthur [...] "Big Boy" [...] Crudup material and that after he met him, he thought the singer really was something else and was someone whose music was growing all the time right up to his death.|$|E
