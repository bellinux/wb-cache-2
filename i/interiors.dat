40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this work}} is to {{introduce}} the concept of L-fuzzy <b>interior</b> systems and L-fuzzy <b>interior</b> operators. We start by establishing a connection between L-fuzzy <b>interior</b> systems and L-fuzzy <b>interior</b> operators. It is shown that an L-fuzzy <b>interior</b> system is precisely the fuzzy system {{in opposition to the}} crisp system, and an L-fuzzy <b>interior</b> operator is a suitable <b>interior</b> operator that has a close relation to an L-fuzzy <b>interior</b> system. It is also shown that there is a Galois correspondence between the category of L-fuzzy <b>interior</b> system spaces and that of L-fuzzy <b>interior</b> spaces...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} evaluated whether <b>interior</b> designer’s had a positive or negative attitude toward sustainable <b>interior</b> design practices. Next, it evaluated the three areas of perceived barriers <b>interior</b> designers encounter when using sustainable <b>interior</b> design practices (project capabilities, transition to sustainability, and knowledge and skills associated with sustainable design). The final objectives determined if attitudes and barriers affected the use of sustainable <b>interior</b> design practices, and determined whether the attitudes of <b>interior</b> designers and the barriers encountered by <b>interior</b> designers were related. Overall, attitudes toward sustainable <b>interior</b> design practices were positive. Barrier scores indicated that factors affecting project capabilities were the biggest obstacle to practicing sustainable <b>interior</b> design. Attitudes toward sustainable <b>interior</b> design practices were highest among respondents who used sustainable <b>interior</b> design practices the most. Barrier scores were lowest among <b>interior</b> designers who used sustainable <b>interior</b> design practices the most. There was a correlation between attitudes and perceived barriers, suggesting a positive attitude partially contributed to overcoming barriers associated with sustainable <b>interior</b> design practices, {{and the ability to}} overcome barriers contributed to a more positive attitude toward sustainable <b>interior</b> design practices...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: Research that investigates how <b>interior</b> {{designers}} use environmentally sustainable <b>interior</b> {{design criteria}} in their design solutions {{has not been}} done. To provide a base to develop education strategies for sustainable <b>interior</b> design, {{this study examined the}} state of environmentally sustainable <b>interior</b> design practice. Approach: A national, Internet-based survey of <b>interior</b> design practitioners was conducted. To collect data, the random sample of US <b>interior</b> design practitioners was drawn from the American Society of <b>Interior</b> Designers membership list. Environmentally sustainable <b>interior</b> design practice was defined by three factors: Global sustainable <b>interior</b> design, indoor environmental quality and <b>interior</b> materials. For each statement about environmentally sustainable <b>interior</b> design practice, respondents were asked to rate three dimensions: frequency of application, importance to the designers firm and importance to the designer. Descriptive statistical analysis focused on the state of environmentally sustainable <b>interior</b> design practice. Results: Every statement to measure environmentally sustainable <b>interior</b> design practice showed the highest mean score in the category of importance to the designer and the lowest mean score in the category of frequency of application. Important to designers firm ratings were always between these two extremes. Use of sustainable <b>interior</b> materials was identified as a less frequently applied component of environmentally sustainable <b>interior</b> design than indoor environmental quality. Conclusion/Recommendations: The application of environmentally sustainable <b>interior</b> design practice did not reach the same level as its perceived importance. Teaching methods that improve environmentally sustainable <b>interior</b> design practice and an understanding of the life cycle impact of <b>interior</b> materials are needed...|$|R
