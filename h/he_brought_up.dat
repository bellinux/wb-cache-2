5|$|The {{last big}} match {{of the season}} was a one-off at Lord's between England and Dominions, a {{combined}} team of players from the British Commonwealth. Miller managed 26 in the Dominions' first innings of 307, {{before coming to the}} crease at 2/60 in the second innings with England still leading by 80 runs. Miller settled in quickly, hitting his second ball through the covers for four and moved to 49 in 49 minutes. <b>He</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> his half-century by lifting Hollies straight back into the crowd. Three balls later, he hit another ball to the same point. At stumps, he was 61 not out with Dominions at 3/145. The next morning, his partner Martin Donnelly was dismissed and replaced by Dominions captain Learie Constantine. Miller then began his attack, hitting the dual leg spin pairing of Hollies and Wright to all parts of the ground. At one point, all the fielders except for the wicketkeeper and the bowler were on the fence.|$|E
5|$|Three {{months after}} his 19th birthday, Harvey made his entry into {{international}} cricket, {{in the last two}} Tests against India. He batted at No. 6 and made 13 in his only innings on debut in the Fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval as Australia swept to an innings victory. The selectors retained him for the Fifth Test on his home ground at Melbourne. After reaching stumps on 78, he reached his century the following day, 7 February 1948. His score of 153 after being promoted to No. 5 made him the youngest Australian Test centurion, surpassing Archie Jackson's previous record. <b>He</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> the mark with an all run five, having turned a short ball from Lala Amarnath towards the square leg boundary.|$|E
5|$|After lunch, Australia scored {{slowly as}} Loxton {{struggled}} {{to come to}} grips with the bowling. Yardley took the new ball in an attempt to trouble the batsmen, but instead, Loxton began to settle in as the ball came onto the bat more quickly. He lofted Pollard to the leg side, almost for six, and then hit three boundaries off another over from the same bowler. Harvey accelerated as well, and 80 minutes into the session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250. On each occasion, umpire Frank Chester walked to the edge of the playing field and tried to inspect where the ball landed amongst the crowd, trying to see if the point of impact was beyond the original playing arena. They were ruled as sixes in any case and some thought Chester’s actions to be more for theatrical than umpiring purposes. Loxton then dominated the scoring with a display of power hitting. <b>He</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> his 50 by hitting Cranston into the pavilion for six, eliciting spontaneous applause from the English players. It also brought up a century stand, which yielded 105 in only 95 minutes. Harvey was out for 112 from 183 balls, but not before the high run rate during the partnership had helped to swing the match back from England's firm control.|$|E

25|$|McDonald {{started his}} first class career with 32 wickets {{in his first}} ten games in 2003–04. His best spell was 6 for 67 against Western Australia. He was {{struggling}} however with the bat and despite batting at 4 {{at the start of}} the summer he would end it at number 8 in the batting order. Finger surgery the following season limited his appearances. In 2005–06 he played just four matches and only managed 83 runs and four wickets. Injury free, McDonald came into his own in the 2006–07 season. In the Pura Cup he boasted a batting average of over a hundred when <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> his 500th run. He finished the season as only the 4th player in Sheffield Shield/Pura Cup history to reach the double of 750 runs and 25 wickets in a season.|$|E
25|$|Campbell was {{inducted}} into the Australian Cricket Academy in 1994, and made his first-class debut for an Academy team in April 1995, playing against the New Zealand Cricket Academy. His debut for Western Australia came in February 1996, during the 1995–96 season of the Mercantile Mutual Cup (the national one-day competition). Campbell initially played as a specialist batsman, with Adam Gilchrist serving as wicket-keeper. He did keep wicket on his Sheffield Shield debut (against Tasmania in November 1996), which came in Gilchrist's absence, but spent the remainder of the season as an opening batsman, partnering with Mike Hussey. Campbell was one of only three WA players to appear in every Sheffield Shield match during the 1996–97 season, and finished with 672 runs, behind only Mike Hussey and Justin Langer amongst his teammates. Against Victoria, he scored a maiden first-class century, making 113 runs from 106 balls. <b>He</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> his century in only 86 balls, making it the fastest hundred of the season.|$|E

25|$|Hoping {{to avoid}} a repeat of their {{disastrous}} top flight campaign in 2000, Park started 2006 well with two wins in three but they soon capitulated when they suffered nine defeats in ten games {{to fall into the}} relegation zone. One of those losses came in an extraordinary game at Hyde which saw Park chalk up a mammoth 321-4. Shahid Mahmood was to score the quickest century in Cheshire County League history as <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> his ton off just 29 balls. However all that hard work was extinguished as Hyde chased the total down to win by two wickets in the final over. Once again, Park could only last one season in the highest tier as they were relegated {{on the final day of}} the season. Foran stepped down as captain with Andrew Gibson stepping into the breach though the club suffered the blow of losing key players like Mahmood and Chris Stenhouse.|$|E
25|$|On 22 May 2017, Sangakkara {{announced}} that the following season {{would be his last}} in first-class cricket and that he would retire at the end of County Championship. He made the announcement after scoring four consecutive centuries becoming the fourth Surrey batsman to achieve this feat (Ian Ward was the last to do it in 2002), pass 20,000 first-class and having scored 592 runs in the said four games. He scored the fifth consecutive century on 26 May against Essex at the County Cricket Ground, Chelmsford. becoming only the eighth player to achieve this feat. In the quarter-final of the Royal London One-Day Cup against Yorkshire, he scored 121 from as many balls, which became his 100th century in all formats of the game combined, that now included 61 in first-class and 39 in List A games. Sangakkara became the first batsman to reach 1,000 runs for the season when <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> his sixth century for the season against Yorkshire.|$|E
25|$|When Strom {{started his}} career in the NBA, he felt the most {{important}} aspect was to get the play right. Instead of selling a bad call, he felt that officials should admit their mistake, and get the call right. To get plays called correctly, <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> the idea of limited use of instant replay for shots made {{at the end of a}} period ("buzzer beaters") and three-point attempts. The NBA eventually adopted the use of instant replay for end of the period field goal attempts and fouls at the start of the 2002–03 NBA season. Strom believed that referee's job was to ensure the game is played correctly, which will allow players to play their particular style. As the NBA began to evolve, Strom opposed the addition of the third official in NBA game for one season, the 1977–78 NBA season, and later in its present form since the 1988–89 NBA season. Strom felt that well-conditioned officials who are able to stay on top of the play would be able to make calls that a third official would be responsible for.|$|E
