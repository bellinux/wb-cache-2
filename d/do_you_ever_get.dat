40|$|Introduction and aim: Tinnitus is {{a common}} {{condition}} affecting approximately 20 % of the older population. There is increasing evidence that changes in the central auditory system following cochlear malfunctioning are responsible for tinnitus. To date, few investigators have studied the influence of genetic factors on tinnitus. The present report investigates {{the presence of a}} familial effect in tinnitus subjects. Methods: In a European multicentre study, 198 families were recruited in seven European countries. Each family had at least 3 siblings. Subjects were screened for causes of hearing loss other than presbyacusis by clinical examination and a questionnaire. The presence of tinnitus was evaluated with the question "Nowadays, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> noises in your head or ear (tinnitus) which usually last longer than five minutes". Familial aggregation was tested using three methods: a mixed model approach, calculating familial correlations, and estimating the risk of a subject having tinnitus if the disorder is present in another family member. Results: All methods demonstrated a significant familial effect for tinnitus. The effect persisted after correction for the effect of other risk factors such as hearing loss, gender and age. The size of the familial effect is smaller than that for age-related hearing impairment, with a familial correlation of 0. 15. Conclusion: The presence of a familial effect for tinnitus opens the door to specific studies that can determine whether this effect is due to a shared familial environment or the involvement of genetic factors. Subsequent association studies may result in the identification of the factors responsible. In addition, more emphasis should be placed on the effect of role models in the treatment of tinnitus...|$|E
5000|$|It {{has always}} been assumed that our pairing was based on his (Nitzsches) Spector accomplishments, but to me that was secondary. In the {{beginning}} I saw Mink DeVille as a hard-edged rock and roll band, and I wanted the Nitzsche whod produced [...] "Memo from Turner" [...] (off the Performance soundtrack) and the great first Crazy Horse album... How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> Jack Nitzsche? Elliott Murphy later asked me incredulously. I {{tried to get him}} for years. The sad truth is that it took one phone call, and even that was sheer luck - or maybe divine providence. I mentioned my mission while chatting with friend and Del Shannon manager Dan Bourgoise, who responded Jack? I can put you in touch with him. Two days later the elusive producer was sitting in my office. I put on a live recording and after the first song, the bands version of Otis Reddings These Arms of Mine, Nitzsche motioned for me to stop the tape. When do we start? he said. They had him. And that was the whole of it, plain and simple. I didnt get Jack Nitzsche. The voice of Willy DeVille did.|$|R

50|$|In a scene {{very similar}} to the one in Hair-Raising Hare, Bugs keeps running until a door on the floor opens and a rock falls into a water pit, where there are {{crocodiles}} swimming around. While he is walking backwards and praying to jump over the crocodiles, he bumps into Rudolf. Bugs comes up with an idea ("Uh oh. Think fast, rabbit!") and makes as a gabby hairdresser, giving the hairy monster a new hairdo ("My stars! Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> that awful hairdo? It doesn't become you at all. Here, for goodness' sake, let me fix it up. Look how stringy and messy it is. What a shame! Such an interesting monster, too. My stars, if an interesting monster can't have an interesting hairdo, then I don't know what things are coming to. In my business, you meet so many interesting people. Bobby pins, please. But the most interesting ones are the monsters. Oh, dear, that'll never stay. We'll just have to have a permanent.") He gets some dynamite sticks and places them in the monster's hair, which give the appearance of curlers. He lights them and runs off ("Now, I've got to give an interesting old lady a manicure; but I'll be back before you're done.") just before the explosion, which leaves Rudolf with a bald head.|$|R

[...] "David, I used to teach geology, and I thought that I {{believed}} what I taught; but now I see that I did not believe it--that it is impossible for man to believe such things as these unless he sees them with his own eyes. We take things for granted, perhaps, because we are told them over and over again, and have no way of disproving them--like religions, for example; but we don't believe them, we only think we <b>do.</b> If <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> back to the outer world you will find that the geologists and paleontologists {{will be the first to}} set you down a liar, for they know that no such creatures as they restore ever existed.

40|$|Translation begins] Saturday My Darling, How are you, honey. I’m so lonesome. Gee- {{every single}} day I miss you more and more. Well, in fifteen more days, we’ll be married, honey. Golly, two weeks from tomorrow. Times getting closer. Well, honey it’s about two hours since I began writing this. Since then I’ve washed my hair and just wasted time in general. Just think 15 more days! Golly, it isn’t very long but it seems years. Tomorrow Gilly + I {{are going to the}} ice show. Oh before I forget- I finally found a negligee. It’s white + half sorta see throughish. Hope you like it, honey. Gee, I haven’t done a thing. Should be rushing around getting things all ready so that I can take it easy the last few days but I just can’t do that. Have to leave almost {{everything}} til the last minute and then rush madly around. That’s a very bad habit of mine. One of many. You should be very thankful that you’re not a girl, honey. Everything happens to us. Oh, honey, every place I go they try to sell me nightgowns. It’s very discouraging. I keep telling them I want pajamas + they smile or rather smurk [sic] knowingly and say you’ll change your mind. Just wait and see- I’ll show ‘em. Everytime I go to New York + plan to get loads of things I come home with one small purchase. How many more trips can I make. Let’s see, what was there I meant to tell you. Oh, yes- got two letters from you today. You’re so sweet, darling. Where are they, oh, yes just a sec- I’ll answer the first one first. Oh, you reminded me. The sunny south musn’t [sic] forget my rain coat. Must also remember to see “Tonight And Every Night”. Haven’t heard anything about it but if you say it’s hot, it sure must be! I like it to rain because then you can write. Golly, probably after we’re married I’ll turn into a regular rain worshipper. Pray for it everyday. I say old top, some British joker could get away with that technique but it’s not your type. What kind of results are you trying to get? Huh? I kinda like the old way better. I’m half asleep, too, honey so if this sounds extra dippy that’s why. When did this “twenty –mission” rush come in? I always thought it was “fifty-mission” rush. Why didn’t you try jumping on them honey? Oh, you saw “Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo”, didn’t <b>you?</b> Well, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> wear those leather jackets often? I like them- you’d look real sharp in one. Gee, honey, I love you- only 15 more days. That sounds so long in a way but not long at all in another way. I hope that you finish flying soon, darling. What will happen if you finish sooner? Will they give you Friday and Saturday off, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think? I hope we can be together for a while before we’re married. Mother said to send her love! Golly, Bobbie is probably in Texas now. I wish I were down in Moultrie now with you. How are instruments, honey? Hope they’re not too hard. They sound awful! You have 10 : 15 more hours, don’t you. I’ll be glad when you’re through. You should be calling me any day now. In about five more days to let me know what you’ll be. Gee, Oh- I almost forgot, honey- Hilda is going to bring a movie camera down and take movies of the wedding. Won’t that be wonderful! I’m so happy. I’ve always wanted to have movies taken of my wedding. You’ll look marvelous in movies. I love you so much. How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> so handsome, darling? You’re too good looking for one man. (not for a woman, though). Gee, it will be marvelous to see you again. Well, darling, this wasn’t very long but I’ve been interrupted more times. It’s taken six hours to write this. I’ll write again tomorrow, honey. I love you more than anything else in the world. Can hardly wait to see you again. I love you so. Always, Dottie [Translation ends...|$|R
