40|$|The {{relatively}} little-studied {{fish fauna}} off southeastern Hispaniola was rapidly assessed {{using a combination}} of visual survey techniques including transects and roving diver surveys. It was found that when combined, both methods provided a more complete overall species assessment than either method was able to provide in isolation. Being able to conduct rapid species assessments is becoming increasingly more important as a conservation tool. Data on species composition, sighting frequency, and abundance of all fishes were collected using both methods. Abundance was recorded in four logarithmic-based categories (roving <b>diver</b> <b>method)</b> while the number of fishes were counted within 40 -m 2 transects (transect method). Both methods were similar in recording the most abundant species, while a greater number of rare species (especially fishery-targeted species) were recorded with the roving <b>diver</b> <b>method.</b> The most abundant groupers were Cephalopholis cruentata and C. fulva. The most abundant parrotfishes were Scarus taeniopterus, Sparisoma aurofrenatum, and Scarus iserti. The most conspicuous differences between fishes off southeastern Hispaniola and elsewhere in the tropical western Atlantic were the low abundance and smaller size of harvested species such as groupers, snappers (Fam. Lutjanidae), and grunts (Fam. Haemulidae). With the roving <b>diver</b> <b>method,</b> more time could be spent surveying (instead of placing transect lines), resulting in a greater number of species being recorded. Additionally, well-trained volunteers can adopt the roving <b>diver</b> <b>method</b> as part of their regular diving program. Transect surveys were able to provide information such as length (biomass) and actual density measures that were not recorded in roving diver surveys. Thus, these methods were complementary and should be used in conjunction when conducting rapid assessments of fish assemblages, especially to detect the effects of overfishing...|$|E

Dynamic cerebral autoregulation {{was assessed by}} determining the strength of phase synchronisation between MAP and CBFV during maximal apnoea. Results The strength of phase synchronisation between MAP and CBFV increased from rest {{until the end of}} maximal voluntary apnoea (P< 0. 05), suggesting that dynamic cerebral autoregulation had weakened by the apnoea breakpoint. The magnitude of impairment in dynamic cerebral autoregulation was strongly, and positively related to the rise in PETCO 2 observed during maximal breath holding (R 2 = 0. 67, P< 0. 05). Interestingly, the impairment in dynamic cerebral autoregulation was not related to the fall in PETO 2 induced by apnoea (R 2 = 0. 01, P = 0. 75). Conclusions This study is the first to report that dynamic cerebral autoregulation is acutely impaired in trained divers performing maximal voluntary apnoea.

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. May 2010. Major: Water Resources Science. Advisor: Dr. Raymond M. Newman. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 88 pages. Submersed aquatic plants {{play an important}} role in freshwater systems, affecting nutrient dynamics, trophic interactions, biological assemblages, and fish productivity. However, waters infested with non-native invasive aquatic plants often experience severe impairment of ecological and recreational quality due to excessive plant growth. Curlyleaf pondweed (Potamogeton crispus L.), one such exotic submersed aquatic plant, has become a widespread nuisance in temperate regions of North America. Curlyleaf’s early-season growth, propensity to form dense surface mats, and ability to out-compete native aquatic plants allow it to degrade the ecological and recreational quality of lakes. Consequently, there has been a great deal of interest in adopting lake-wide management strategies that can reduce the negative impacts of curlyleaf and provide some degree of long-term control. We collaborated with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources in 2006, 2007, and 2008 to evaluate lake-wide, early-season herbicide treatments for curlyleaf management. Six curlyleaf-infested lakes were treated with herbicide (endothall or fluridone) for at least three consecutive years. Three additional lakes with established curlyleaf infestations were selected to serve as untreated reference lakes during the same period. For all study lakes, we annually assessed the frequency and biomass of curlyleaf in May and June, documented the production of new curlyleaf turions (reproductive buds) on standing plants, and tracked changes in the abundance and viability of turions in lake sediments. Previous studies have shown that biomass is a key metric for evaluating aquatic plant management projects. We used a boat-based rake method for collecting biomass samples rather than the standard <b>diver</b> (SCUBA) quadrat <b>method</b> because it allowed us to collect a greater number of samples in each lake and provided a higher degree of safety than the <b>diver</b> quadrat <b>method.</b> However, this boat-based rake method had not been thoroughly evaluated to determine whether it produced biomass estimates that were comparable to the <b>diver</b> quadrat <b>method.</b> Consequently, we conducted a separate study to compare the vertical rake sampling <b>method</b> to the <b>diver</b> quadrat <b>method.</b> Results of this study showed that biomass estimates from rake samples were comparable to diver quadrat samples for most individual plant taxa. However, the rake method produced substantially higher estimates than the quadrat method when sampling in dense stands of aquatic plants, particularly in areas dominated by coontail (Ceratophyllum demersum L.). Although rake estimates of plant biomass were significantly less precise than quadrat estimates, we determined that the rake method allowed us to collect a sufficiently greater number of samples to offset the method’s lower precision. Consequently, we concluded that the biomass data we collected were precise enough to make meaningful relative comparisons in our study lakes. After three to four consecutive years of herbicide treatment, curlyleaf frequency, biomass, turion production, and sediment turion abundance were all reduced and were all significantly lower in treated lakes than in untreated reference lakes. However, viable turions remained in lake sediments after three consecutive years of treatment. These results suggest that serial lake-wide, early-season herbicide treatments can effectively decrease the negative impacts of curlyleaf infestation and reduce the abundance of curlyleaf turions in lake sediments, but ongoing management will likely be required to maintain long-term control of curlyleaf in infested lakes...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Sport diving is {{a popular}} leisure {{activity}} with {{an increasing number of}} participants. According to the German diving industries there are more than 406. 000 recreational divers even in Germany. Nitrox is a more and more frequently used alternative breathing gas mixture with more than 21 % oxygen. So far there were no detailed investigations with recreational divers whether this increased oxygen content can lead to injuries during conservative sport dives in healthy <b>divers.</b> <b>Methods</b> During this study 25 divers undertook two identical dives, one with compressed air and the other with nitrox 40 to a depth of 25 m with a bottom time of 25 min. Before and after diving the elasticity of forearm vessels was tested by flow-mediated-dilatation, lung function was investigated by spirometry and oscillometry, micro bubbles were detected by Doppler ultrasound in the vena jugularis interna at 30, 60 and 90 min after surfacing. During the dives an ECG was taken to investigate the heart rate variability (HRV) and a nitrogen narcosis test was performed. Results Diving with nitrox 40 lead to an increased peripheral pulmonary resistance of 9 %, the reactance decreased about 11 %. The elasticity of the forearm vessels increased 4, 4 % after compressed air diving and decreased 21 % after nitrox. Breathing nitrox lead to a reduction of the number of micro bubbles of 39 %. Using nitrox improved memory (34 %) and alertness (8, 8 %). The HRV increased during the dive. The decreasing heart frequency shows a stronger activation of the parasympathetic nervous system during nitrox 40 diving. Conclusion This study shows both advantages and disadvantages using nitrox 40. As disadvantages we can see the increasing peripheral pulmonary resistance und the decreasing elasticity of blood vessels. Advantages are the significantly reduced number of micro bubbles, a better received memory and alertness and the increased activity of the parasympathetic nervous system. Nitrox appears as a double-edged sword...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Molecular markers are {{essential}} in {{plant and animal}} breeding and biodiversity applications, in human forensics, and for map-based cloning of genes. The long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons are well suited as molecular markers. As dispersed and ubiquitous transpos-able elements, their “copy and paste ” life cycle of replica-tive transposition leads to new genome insertions without excision of the original element. Both the overall structure of retrotransposons and the domains responsible for the various phases of their replication are highly conserved in all eukaryotes. Nevertheless, {{up to a year}} has been required to develop a retrotransposon marker system in a new spe-cies, involving cloning and sequencing steps as well as the development of custom primers. Here, we describe a novel PCR-based method useful both as a marker system in its own right and for the rapid isolation of retrotransposon ter-mini and full-length elements, making it ideal for “orphan crops ” and other species with underdeveloped marker sys-tems.

Orientation of > 300 settlement-stage larvae of Chromis atripectoralis (Pomacentridae) measured over 1998 - 2008 by divers near Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef was consistent. All 10 data sets had southerly orientation at all locations; 94 % of larvae swam directionally. Median bearings east and west of Lizard Island were 166 degrees and 170 degrees, respectively. Orientation precision was significantly higher under sunny than cloudy skies. Similar mean bearings were obtained in 2008 with more than 125 larvae observed in a drifting in situ chamber (DISC). Orientation varied with time of day. In sunny conditions, precision was weakly, significantly correlated with time of day, but not solar elevation; however, {{a greater proportion of}} larvae was significantly directional at low (50 degrees) solar elevation.

The internet is a recent innovation to gain information on real-time health issues of travel destinations, including Southeast Asia. Methods: We applied the model of internet-based retrospective health data aggregation, through the Divers Alert Network Asia-Pacific (DAN AP), together with more conventional methods of literature and media searches, to document the health significance, and clinical spectrum, of box jellyfish stings in Malaysia for the period January 1, 2000 to July 30, 2010. Results: Three fatalities, consistent with chirodropid envenomation, were identified for the period—all tourists to Malaysia. Non-fatal chirodropid stings were also documented. During 2010, seven cases consistent with moderately severe Irukandji syndrome were reported to DAN and two representative cases are discussed here. Photographs of chirodropid (multi-tentacled), carybdeid (four-tentacled) box jellyfish, and of severe sting lesions were also submitted to DAN during this period. Conclusions: This study suggests that the frequency and severity of jellyfish stings affecting tourists in Southeast Asia have been significantly underestimated. Severe and fatal cases of chirodropid-type stings occur in coastal waters off Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah, Borneo. Indeed, the first Malaysian cases consistent with Irukandji-like syndrome are reported here.

Department of Mechanical Engineering ME 494 In order to find a safer <b>method</b> for recreational <b>divers</b> to recover small submerged object, Bazinga Team, a senior project design group from the California Maritime Academy, designed and built an automatically ascending, double lift point, self-contained lifting device. The concept stems from the manually operated lift bags used for recreational diver salvage. This project will allow <b>divers</b> a hands-free <b>method</b> to execute salvage operations. A number of methods were discussed for accomplishing this task. The method chosen consists of a control module attached to a scuba tank that will supply input air for two lift bags and discharge air from the bags using a pneumatic actuator. A pressure sensor and accelerometer are used to input values to an Arduino that are needed to determine rate of ascent and orientation of the object being salvaged. This device is being developed to operate at approximately 100 ft, which is the safe limit for recreational divers. The composition of the device includes a number of off-the-shelf components for ease of acquisition, cost, and assembly. The internal components of the control module will include operating valves for the air system, an Arduino, a control circuit board, a pressure sensor, batteries, a start switch, and an accelerometer. The components external of the cap and tube style module, are the tank and regulator, air lines rigging gear and the lift bags. The lift bags will include pneumatic actuators mounted to the dump valves. The device is in the prototype stage {{for the purposes of}} the academic requirements. The team fabricated many of the parts in the device, while the rest were purchased, installed, and function tested. Many issues had to be managed to be ready for pool testing. Watertight integrity was determined as well as electromechanical function. Control issues were resolved by building addition branches of the electrical circuit, particularly in the case of adapting the pressure sensor resolution into a usable range for the scope of the project. The device was tested in the CMA pool. While the electromechanical testing in the pool was satisfactory, there were resource constraints that prevented the necessary testing to get a satisfactory test of the control system. The project group is planning to develop a 2 nd iteration after graduation. California Maritime Academy [...] Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
