40|$|In this paper, we {{optimize}} {{and evaluate}} computational models of similarity for {{sounds from the}} same <b>instrument</b> <b>class.</b> We investigate four instrument classes: bass drums, snare drums, high-pitched toms, and low-pitched toms. We evaluate two similarity models: one is defined in the ISO/IEC MPEG- 7 standard, {{and the other is}} based on auditory images. For the second model, we study the impact of various parameters. We use data from listening tests, and <b>instrument</b> <b>class</b> labels to evaluate the models. Our results show that the model based on auditory images yields a very high average correlation with human similarity ratings and clearly outperforms the MPEG- 7 recommendation. The average correlations range from 0. 89 – 0. 96 depending on the <b>instrument</b> <b>class.</b> Furthermore, our results indicate that <b>instrument</b> <b>class</b> data can be used as alternative to data from listening tests to evaluate sound similarity models...|$|R

40|$|This paper asserts the {{importance}} of using multiple rep-resentations when examining computational descriptions of any musical percept. We examine the existing state-of-the-art among the MPEG- 7 timbre descriptors, and by choosing oboe timbre as our domain we investigate their application to timbres from the same instrument. Using a dual approach, correlating perceptual informa-tion {{with a wide range}} of computational descriptors, we propose potential extensions to MPEG- 7 representa-tions. By eliminating the need for generality across in-struments, we believe we can reach a higher level of semantic representation within timbre domains from a single <b>instrument</b> <b>class.</b> 1...|$|R

The goal of {{this work}} is to {{incorporate}} the visual modality into a musical instrument recognition system. For that, we first evaluate state-of-the-art image recognition techniques {{in the context of}} music instrument recognition, using a database of about 20000 images and 12 <b>instrument</b> <b>classes.</b> We then reproduce the results of state-of-the-art methods for audio-based musical instrument recognition, considering standard datasets including more than 9000 sound excerpts and 45 <b>instrument</b> <b>classes.</b> We finally compare the accuracy and confusions in both modalities and we showcase how they can be integrated for audio-visual instrument recognition in music videos. We obtain around 0. 75 F 1 -measure for audio and 0. 77 for images and similar confusions between instruments. This study confirms that visual (shape) and acoustic (timbre) properties of music instruments are related to each other and reveals the potential of audiovisual music description systems.

The audio was sampled at 44. 1 kHz and stored as 16 bit wav files. The instruments were played by Ying Wan of the London Jing Kun Opera Association. Unlike some instruments that can be tuned, these percussion instruments are made from metal casting. Thus, there can be subtle timbral differences even across different instruments of the same kind. For each of these instruments, we used 2 - 3 individual instruments to record the samples, hoping to achieve a better timbre coverage. Further, audio samples were recorded using different playing techniques for each instrument. /n /nThe dataset can be used for training models for each percussion instrument class. /n/nThe whole dataset (wav files) can be downloaded as a pack from Freesound: [URL] Opera percussion dataset {{is a collection}} of 236 examples of isolated strokes spanning the four percussion <b>instrument</b> <b>classes</b> used in Beijing Opera.

50|$|The {{original}} GPIB {{standard was}} developed in the late 1960s by Hewlett-Packard to connect and control the programmable instruments the company manufactured. The introduction of digital controllers and programmable test equipment created a need for a standard, high-speed interface for communication between instruments and controllers from various vendors. In 1975, the IEEE published ANSI/IEEE Standard 488-1975, IEEE Standard Digital Interface for Programmable Instrumentation, which contained the electrical, mechanical, and functional specifications of an interfacing system. This standard was subsequently revised in 1978 (IEEE-488.1) and 1990 (IEEE-488.2). The IEEE 488.2 specification includes the Standard Commands for Programmable Instrumentation (SCPI), which define specific commands that each <b>instrument</b> <b>class</b> must obey. SCPI ensures compatibility and configurability among these instruments.|$|R
