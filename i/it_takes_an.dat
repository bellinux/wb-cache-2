In a third of cases, pulmonary contusion is not visible on the first chest radiograph performed. <b>It</b> <b>takes</b> <b>an</b> average of sixhours for the characteristic white regions to show up on a chest X-ray, and the contusion may not become apparent for 48hours. When a pulmonary contusion is apparent in an X-ray, it suggests that the trauma to the chest was severe and that a CT scan might reveal other injuries that were missed with X-ray.|$|E

TVB and RTV became involved in copyright lawsuits against each other because of similarities between Chor Lau-heung and <b>It</b> <b>Takes</b> <b>a</b> Thief. TVB won the lawsuits and eventually RTV had to change the Chinese title of <b>It</b> <b>Takes</b> <b>a</b> Thief from 盜帥留香 to 俠盜風流, {{and the names of}} characters in the television series. <b>It</b> <b>Takes</b> <b>a</b> Thief started airing on 1 September 1979, two days earlier than TVB's Chor Lau-heung.|$|R

25|$|Crayfish {{often find}} {{themselves}} in a conflicting situation where they are performing the highly motivated behavior of feeding when they suddenly receive a tail flip stimulus. Often, the crayfish will not perform a tail flip in this situation. This is because when a crayfish is actively feeding, the LGI itself is modulated by the behavior. Feeding increases the threshold for the tail flip, and even when the tail is tapped, no spikes are initiated. As a result, <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>an</b> especially strong stimulus to elicit the tail flip. This prevents the crayfish from going hungry unless it is absolutely necessary.|$|E
25|$|Line 2 and 7 of Seoul Metropolitan Subway both {{operate at}} the station. Line 2 is {{operated}} by Seoul Metro {{and is a}} circle route with two spur lines. The subway runs with varying headways depending {{on the time of}} day. During rush hour it can come as often as every 5 minutes and in non-peak times it can be as infrequent as every 15 minutes. <b>It</b> <b>takes</b> <b>an</b> equal amount of time in either direction to reach Guro Digital Complex Station on Line 2 from Konkuk University Station making it the mid-way point {{on the opposite side of}} the loop.|$|E
25|$|Because {{it is the}} {{summation}} of the action potentials that eventually results in the threshold polarization being crossed, the temporal relationship of different input signals {{is very important in}} determining if and when a post-synaptic neuron will fire. Over time, the time <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>an</b> action potential to propagate down the length of a particular axon can change. In one experiment multielectrode arrays were used to measure the time it took for action potentials to travel from one electrode to another, called latency. The neurons were then stimulated and the value of the latency was recorded over time. The latency values changed over time, suggesting that axonal plasticity influenced the propagation of action potentials.|$|E

25|$|Most {{people who}} {{contract}} HPV do {{so soon after}} becoming sexually active. <b>It</b> <b>takes</b> <b>an</b> average of a year, but {{can take up to}} four years, for a person's immune system to control the initial infection. Screening during this period may show this immune reaction and repair as mild abnormalities, which are usually not associated with cervical cancer, but could cause the patient stress and result in further tests and possible treatment. Cervical cancer usually takes time to develop, so delaying the start of screening a few years poses little risk of missing a potentially precancerous lesion. For instance, screening people under age 25 does not decrease cancer rates under age 30.|$|E
25|$|Yasuna's {{character}} changes {{between the}} manga and anime {{in regard to}} her level of devotion towards Hazumu and how much she {{is willing to do}} to be with her, especially after Hazumu's transformation into a girl. The first instance of this is when Yasuna confesses her love to Hazumu the first day she returns to school as a girl, but in the anime she does not confess to Hazumu after the change and in fact starts to avoid her. Similarly, during the time when Hazumu is shopping for her first bra, Yasuna shows up in the manga version and helps Hazumu into a very feminine bra, but in the anime it is Tomari who helps her try on her first bra. In episode three of the anime, Yasuna continues to avoid Hazumu despite still longing for her, and <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>an</b> effort by Hazumu to restore their previous friendship, but Yasuna never once tries to avoid Hazumu in the manga; on the contrary, Yasuna tries to be around Hazumu as much as possible in the manga version. During the time when Yasuna holds a curry party in the manga, which is combined with the beach trip in episode seven of the anime, Yasuna tells Tomari that she wants all of Hazumu to herself and she invited the others to the party so that she could see Hazumu's brightest smile. However, during the same scene in the anime, Yasuna tells Tomari that she invited Tomari and the others so that she could learn more about Hazumu and her likes and dislikes.|$|E
25|$|The Skeena River {{originates}} at {{the southern}} end of Spatsizi Plateau, in a valley between Mount Gunanoot and Mount Thule, south of the Stikine River watershed. The abandoned track of BC Rail's Dease Lake Extension runs along the river in its upper course. It flows south-east, between the shallow peaks of the Skeena Mountains, through the McEvoy and Jackson flats. It continues in this direction until it passes the Slamgeesh Range, then flows westwards to Fourth Cabin, when it turns south through a shallow canyon below Poison Mountain. After Kuldo <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>an</b> eastward turn, then flows south again below Cutoff Mountain and Mount Pope. It continues through rolling hills to the community of Kispiox and then Hazelton, where it receives the waters of Morice-Bulkley River, and turns south-west. The Yellowhead Highway and a Canadian National Railway track follow the course of the Skeena on this section. At Kitwanga, the river is crossed by Highway 37, and then turns south around the Seven Sisters Peaks and Bulkley Ranges, through the Skeena Provincial Forest, then between the Nass Ranges and Borden Glacier, past the ferry crossing at Usk, through the Kitselas Canyon, and then through the Kleanza Creek Provincial Park. It then flows south-west through the city of Terrace, where the river widens. It continues westwards, followed by the Highway 16 and Canadian National Railway line, passes near the Exchamsiks River Provincial Park, then flows into the Dixon Entrance at Eleanor Passage, between Port Edward and Port Essington, facing De Horsey Island.|$|E

500|$|Amy Donaldson, in {{her book}} We Want to Believe contrasted the soul eater from [...] "The Gift" [...] to Leonard Betts, a [...] "Monster-of-the-Week" [...] {{character}} from the fourth season episode of the same name. In the episode, Mulder and Scully investigate the supposed death and regeneration of an emergency medical technician (EMT) named Leonard Betts, a mutant who subsists on and can detect cancer in others, as well as regenerate severed body parts. Donaldson reasons that Betts' condition, {{in which he is}} [...] "riddled with cancer" [...] but can [...] "see the sickness within people", is a metaphor for someone who [...] "has let sin or evil become the regular course of life". Although Betts can detect and consume the illness, his motives are derived from [...] "his own self appetite". Donaldson argues that the soul eater is the polar opposite of Betts because <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>an</b> illness in order to help a person. This is in contrast to Betts, who takes an illness—and harms his victim in the process—in order to keep himself alive.|$|E

500|$|The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) {{replied in}} the New Statesman that Goldacre was [...] "stuck in {{a bygone era}} where {{pharmaceutical}} companies wine and dine doctors in exchange for signing on the dotted line". The ABPI issued a press release, writing that the pharmaceutical industry {{is responsible for the}} discovery of 90 percent of all medicines, and that <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>an</b> average of 10–12 years and £1.1bn to introduce a medicine to the market, with just one in 5,000 new compounds receiving regulatory approval. This makes research and development an expensive and risky business. They wrote that the industry {{is one of the most}} heavily regulated in the world, and is committed to ensuring full transparency in the research and development of new medicines. They also maintained that the examples Goldacre offered were [...] "long documented and historical, and the companies concerned have long addressed these issues". Goldacre argues in the book that [...] "the most dangerous tactic of all is the industry's enduring claim that these problems are all in the past".|$|E
500|$|This re-appropriation of {{established}} texts, resources, and artistic properties {{to tell a}} story or make a statement {{is an example of a}} semiotic phenomenon known as intertextuality or resemiosis. [...] A more common term for this phenomenon is “parody”, but not all of these intertextual productions are intended for humor or satire, as demonstrated by the Few Good G-Men video. Furthermore, the argument of how well-protected machinima is under the guise of parody or satire is still highly debated; a piece of machinima may be reliant upon a protected property, but may not necessarily be making a statement about that property. Therefore, it is more accurate to refer to it simply as resemiosis, because <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>an</b> artistic work and presents it in a new way, form, or medium. This resemiosis can be manifested in a number of ways. The machinima-maker can be considered an author who restructures the story and/or the world that the chosen game engine is built around. In the popular web series Red vs. Blue, most of the storyline takes place within the game engine of [...] and its subsequent sequels. [...] has an extensive storyline already, but Red vs. Blue only ever makes mention of this storyline once in the first episode. [...] Even after over 200 episodes of the show being broadcast onto the Internet since 2003, the only real similarities that can be drawn between Red vs. Blue and the game-world it takes place in are the character models, props, vehicles, and settings. Yet Burnie Burns and the machinima team at Rooster Teeth created an extensive storyline of their own using these game resources.|$|E
500|$|McKellen has {{appeared}} in limited release films, such as Emile (which was shot in three weeks following the X2 shoot), Neverwas and Asylum. He appeared as Sir Leigh Teabing in The Da Vinci Code. During a 17 May 2006 interview on The Today Show with the Da Vinci Code cast and director, Matt Lauer posed a question to the group about how they would have felt if the film had borne a prominent disclaimer {{that it is a}} work of fiction, as some religious groups wanted. McKellen responded, [...] "I've often thought the Bible should have a disclaimer in the front saying 'This is fiction.' I mean, walking on water? <b>It</b> <b>takes...</b> <b>an</b> act of faith. And I have faith in this movie– not that it's true, not that it's factual, but that it's a jolly good story." [...] He continued, [...] "And I think audiences are clever enough and bright enough to separate out fact and fiction, and discuss the thing when they've seen it". McKellen appeared in the 2006 BBC series of Ricky Gervais' comedy series Extras, where he played himself directing Gervais' character Andy Millman in a play about gay lovers. McKellen received a 2007 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor - Comedy Series nomination for his performance. In 2009 he portrayed Number Two in The Prisoner, a remake of the 1967 cult series The Prisoner. In 2013, McKellen co-starred in the ITV sitcom Vicious as Freddie Thornhill, alongside Derek Jacobi. The series revolves around an elderly gay couple who have been together for 50 years. On 23 August 2013 the show was renewed for a six-episode second series which began airing in June 2015.|$|E
