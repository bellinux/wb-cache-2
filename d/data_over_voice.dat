From it’s conception, telecomm systems were exclusively for voice transmission with some low speed telemetry providing the data transfer. With the importance of computing from the 80 ’s onwards, fixed telecommunication systems have been rapidly changing its emphasis from voice to data transfer (e. g. ISDN, ATM etc.). Historically, mobile telecommunication systems focused almost entirely on voice in both their design and structure. New areas, 3 rd generation mobile telecommunication systems undergoing standardisation are primarily focusing on high speed <b>data</b> <b>over</b> <b>voice</b> in an attempt to support users wish for mobile data access. At the beginning of the standardisation process, it was unknown if sufficient data services existed to justify the introduction of such a system. However, both the explosions in the internet activity and peoples love of mobility (e. g. mobile phones, PDA’s) has seemingly guaranteed the success of the 3 rd generation mobile concept. In essence, mobile systems have evolved from been primarily voice services based to voice and data, where data may be the primary service. The data services described for these new generation systems are primarily data transfer services, e. g. email, internet applications and web.

40|$|In today’s {{research}} and market, IT applications for health-care are gaining huge interest of both IT and medical researchers. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) {{are considered the}} largest {{cause of death for}} both men and women regardless of ethnic backgrounds. More efficient treatments and most importantly efficient methods of cardiac diagnosis that examine heart diseases are desired. Electrocardiography (ECG) is an essential method used to diagnose heart diseases. However, diagnosing any cardiovascular disease based on the 12 -lead ECG printout from an ECG machine using human eye might seriously impair analysis accuracy. To meet this challenge of today’s ECG analysis methodology, a more reliable solution that can analyze huge amount of patient’s data in real-time is desired. The software solution presented in this article is aimed to reduce the risk while diagnosing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) by human eye, computation of large-scale patient’s data in real-time at the patient’s location and sending the required results or summary to the doctor/nurse. Keeping in mind the importance of real-time analysis of patient’s data, the software system has built upon small individual algorithms/modules designed for multi-core architecture, where each module is supposed to be processed by an individual core/processor in parallel. All the input and output processes to the analysis system are made automated, which reduces operator’s interaction to the system and thus reducing the cost. The outputs/results of the processing are summarized to smaller files in both ASCII and binary formats to meet the requirement of exchanging the <b>data</b> <b>over</b> <b>Voice</b> and Data Networks...|$|E
40|$|Q uick {{access to}} {{information}} cansave lives. This {{is especially true for}} first responders like the police, fire department, or emergency medical technicians. First responders commonly receive information to aid them in their field duties from a radio dispatcher, if one is available, over a two-way radio. Recently, in-vehicle laptops have become an option for direct data access over wireless networks. But the laptop systems have some limitations. For example, they don’t offer hands-free or eyes-free interfaces. Furthermore, they often use advanced wireless technolo-gies for data transmission, such as Cel-lular Digital Packet Data systems. Such technologies aren’t always available, especially not in poor rural areas. In Alabama, where we developed the Voice Law Enforcement Tactical Sys-tem (VoiceLETS), some financially con-strained rural counties can’t offer police and other first responders access to radio dispatchers. Even in counties that do, the dispatchers are often over-worked, which can limit access to them. The same budget constraints that restrict the number of dispatchers and increase their workloads also keep many agencies from implementing in-vehicle laptop systems. Yet lack of {{access to information}} can put first responders at a potentially fatal risk. For example, figure 1 shows an officer approaching a stopped vehicle from the rear. He will be safer if he knows the car’s status before he addresses the driver. If the vehicle is stolen, he can prepare for an arrest rather than a routine speeding ticket. Auburn University and the University of Alabama developed VoiceLETS in a collaborate research effort sponsored by the Southwest Alabama Integrated Criminal Justice System to address this issue for rural law enforcement agen-cies. We focused on fielded and estab-lished technologies, using the existing cellular infrastructure to transport <b>data</b> <b>over</b> <b>voice</b> channels.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Link- 11 is a {{tactical}} digital communication network standard deployed in military platforms now for several decades. The standard employs the digital modulation technique Differential Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (DQPSK) to encode formatted binary messages (M-series messages) onto an audio channel, {{which are then}} modulated and transmitted over a radio communications network. Testing of the various systems that use this communications network requires either a fully operational RF network or exchange of the audio-encoded <b>data</b> <b>over</b> a <b>voice</b> channel. An alternative is to send and receive over an IP network, by encoding and decoding the audio from a Data Terminal Set (DTS) {{that is part of}} the normal operational equipment. This allows the test community to interconnect distant test sites over IP networks using this robust connectivity for message exchanges. This facilitates interoperability testing at the data and applications level where RF and audio connectivity is not available or is unreliable. We explore this approach to interoperability testing of Link- 11 by implementing a gateway between the Link- 11 network and a TCP/IP network. Such a gateway has been built and tested at the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) by a team of contractors and government. A review of the engineering and implementation is provided, along with a proposed future expansion of the prototype within a given experimental frame in the Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) framework...|$|R

The thesis {{is concerned with the}} detection of digital <b>data</b> transmitted <b>over</b> <b>voice</b> frequency channels such as telephone circuits and HF radio links, where the main impairment is additive noise and intersymbol interference, and the latter may be time-invariant or may vary slowly with time. The characteristics of these channels are briefly reviewed and a survey of the most important known detection techniques is presented. The thesis includes also a detailed study of quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) signals transmitted over voice-channels, both, when the transmission path has time-invariant characteristics and when it introduces Rayleigh fading into the transmitted data signal. Based on this study, baseband models of QAM systems are suggested for use when these are to be computer simulated. A systematic study of channel models is carried out here. The transmission and detection of baseband signals over telephone circuits in the presence of frequency offset is investigated and a baseband signal generated by means of Hilbert transform pairs is suggested for this purpose. It is shown that this signal exhibits theoretical and experimental equivalence to a QAM signal. Several near-maximum likelihood detection techniques have been developed for the detection of digital data signals serially transmitted at 19200 bit/s over telephone lines and at 9600 bit/s over HF radio links. The performance of the detection systems has been evaluated by computer simulation and is given in terms of their tolerance to additive white Gaussian noise...|$|R
