5|$|At {{their first}} series of {{meetings}} on 14 September, the Night Defence Committee began collecting a series of suggestions for improvements, which were discussed in depth on 1 October. These were passed on to Dowding for implementation, but he found that many of their suggestions were already out of date. For instance, they suggested building new radars {{that could be used}} over land, allowing the fight to continue throughout the raid. A contract for this type of radar had already been sent out in June or July. They suggested that the filter room at RAF Bentley Priory be devolved down to the Group headquarters to improve the flow of information, but Dowding had already <b>gone</b> <b>a</b> step further and devolved night interception to the Sector level at the airfields. Dowding accepted only four of the suggestions.|$|E
5|$|Erika Hügel-Marshall {{was born}} on 13 March 1947, {{the child of a}} Bavarian woman and an African-American soldier, Eddie Marshall, who had {{returned}} to the US before her birth. Her parents had met just after the end of World War II, after a relaxation of laws forbidding military personnel from interacting with civilians. According to her, black soldiers treated native German children well, distributing food and clothing, but her parents generally met in secret due to racist remarks from others. In November 1946 her father returned to the US after an illness. By that time, both of them knew that her mother was pregnant, but she did not know he was leaving until after he was already <b>gone.</b> <b>A</b> year after Ika's birth, her mother married a German and a half-sister was born the following year. Her mother and grandmother loved her and treated her like any other child, despite social disapproval. She was close to her half-sister, but her step-father was distant toward her.|$|E
5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) is {{depressed}} {{because it}} is the first Valentine's Day since he and Holly broke up. Michael donates blood at a mobile blood drive being held in the business park's parking lot and has a nice conversation with a female donor (Kathryn Aselton) sitting next to him. When they both finish at the same time, Michael passes out because he did not eat much before giving blood, and when he wakes up she is <b>gone.</b> <b>A</b> disappointed Michael finds a glove he assumes she left behind and takes it, hoping she will come back for it. When Michael goes back into the office, he decides to gather all the single employees into the conference room to discuss their own personal romantic dilemmas. After becoming further depressed by their sad dating stories, Michael decides to try lifting their spirits by holding a singles mixer. He puts up flyers which also advertise the finding of a missing glove, and Michael hopes his mystery woman will come to the party as a result.|$|E

50|$|The Real Wheels {{series is}} a {{collection}} of children's videos (also known as There <b>Goes</b> <b>a...).</b> Three episodes, There <b>Goes</b> <b>a</b> Garbage Truck, There Goes the Mail and There <b>Goes</b> <b>a</b> Rescue Vehicle, were released {{as a part of the}} short-lived Dream Big series. Each episode focuses on different transportation vehicles; however, one episode is reserved for Santa Claus, and another for roller coasters. Each is live-action, starring Hood, and is sometimes accompanied by a sidekick, Becky Borg. He is absent from There <b>Goes</b> <b>a</b> Tractor, Farm Truck, and Dump Truck and is replaced by Dave Sidoni, but comes back in Here Comes a Roller Coaster and stars in 3 more episodes which are on Tanks, Rescue Heroes, and Buses.|$|R
25|$|Upon the 5 a.m. sunrise, {{reportedly}} a train whistle {{was heard}} (Hirsch {{said it was}} a siren). Many believed this to be a signal for the rioters to launch an all-out assault on Greenwood. A white man stepped out from behind the Frisco depot and was fatally shot by a sniper in Greenwood. Crowds of rioters poured from places of shelter, on foot and by car, into the streets of the black community. Five white men in a car led the charge, but were killed by a fusillade of gunfire before they had <b>gone</b> <b>a</b> block.|$|E
25|$|Van Vliet {{used the}} ensuing publicity, {{particularly}} with a 1970 Rolling Stone interview with Langdon Winner, to promulgate {{a number of}} myths that were subsequently quoted as fact. Winner's article stated, for instance, that neither Van Vliet nor {{the members of the}} Magic Band ever took drugs, but Harkleroad later contradicted this. Van Vliet claimed to have taught both Harkleroad and Boston to play their instruments from scratch; in fact the pair were already accomplished young musicians before joining the band. Last, Van Vliet claimed to have <b>gone</b> <b>a</b> year and half without sleeping. When asked how this was possible, he claimed to have only eaten fruit.|$|E
25|$|Keane was {{selected}} by Mick McCarthy {{as part of the}} Republic of Ireland squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan, scoring three goals in Ireland's four games. Keane scored an injury-time equaliser against Germany in the group stage match as the Irish surprised many by holding the former champions to a 1–1 draw. This was the first of only three goals which Germany conceded in the tournament (the other two were scored in the final by Brazil's Ronaldo). In the Round of 16 match against Spain, he scored a last-minute penalty to force the game into extra-time and a penalty shootout after the Irish had <b>gone</b> <b>a</b> goal down early in the first half, but eventually lost 3–2 on penalties.|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} 20th century, {{the town had}} seen a growth in tourism, leading to the {{appearance}} of many antique dealers, as well as art dealers and independent bookshops (the latter now mostly <b>gone).</b> <b>A</b> long battle of words between local activists (including many of the town's independent businesses) and Tesco was eventually solved when the mega retailer obtained planning permission to build a supermarket on Corve Street, on {{the northern edge of}} the town centre, but only after agreeing to conform to the architectural demands of the local council. The building is designed to follow the shape of the old town plans with a curving roof. Bodenhams, a clothing retailer, has been trading from a 600-year-old timbered building since 1860 {{and is one of the}} oldest stores in Britain.|$|E
25|$|Modern mayflies have {{eliminated}} all the instars between imago and nymph, except the single instar called subimago, {{which is still}} not (at {{least not in the}} males) fully sexually mature. The other flying insects with incomplete metamorphosis (Exopterygota) have <b>gone</b> <b>a</b> little further and completed the trend; here all the immature structures of the animal from the last nymphal stage are completed at once in a single final moult. The more advanced insects with larvae and complete metamorphosis (Endopterygota) have gone even further. An interesting theory here is that the pupal stage is actually a strongly modified and extended stage of subimago, but so far it {{is nothing more than a}} theory. Interestingly enough there are some insects within the Exopterygota, thrips and whiteflies (Aleyrodidae), who have evolved pupae-like stages too.|$|E
25|$|Sussex won the toss at the Oval {{and elected}} to bat. Mark Ramprakash captained Surrey as Mark Butcher {{has still not}} {{recovered}} from the injury that saw him miss England's winter tour. Only 49 overs could be bowled on the first day, as rain delayed the start till after lunch, and bad light brought an early conclusion. Cloud cover helped the bowlers, but Sussex, thanks to Michael Yardy's 44 not out, finished the day on 171 for 4. The second day saw 61 overs. Yardy, again under cloud-covered skies, progressed to 111, which will have <b>gone</b> <b>a</b> long way to helping him cement a regular first team place. Rikki Clarke, who took 4 for 91, appears a yard quicker than last season, and to have improved after his poor season last year. Sussex finished the second day on 370, and Surrey on 6 for 1.|$|E

25|$|At the Kai Monastery {{is a young}} initiate, {{given the}} name Silent Wolf. On the feastday of Fehmarn, when all the Kai Lords gather at the monastery, Silent Wolf is sent to cut wood from the {{surrounding}} forest as a punishment for his inattention in class. While he is <b>gone,</b> <b>a</b> surprise attack is launched from the Darklands at several places across Sommerlund. The Monastery is assaulted and the gathered Kai Lords massacred. Rushing back from the woods, Silent Wolf is knocked out by a low-lying tree branch (in the Legends of Lone Wolf novelizations based on the books, it's implied that the branch was placed there by a demi-goddess called Alyss so Silent Wolf would be spared the attack). When he awakes, he finds himself the only survivor. The last of the Kai, he renames himself Lone Wolf and sets out for the capital to inform the King {{of the loss of}} the Kai.|$|E
25|$|Elsewhere, Carol (Melissa McBride) and Tyreese (Chad L. Coleman), {{caring for}} Rick's infant {{daughter}} Judith, {{are following the}} tracks to Terminus but hide from a walker horde. They hear a firework set off nearby and follow the noise to a cabin, manned by Martin (Chris Coy), in radio contact with Terminus and using the noise to direct the walker horde away from the train yard. Carol and Tyreese learn that Rick's group is captured inside, and the two quickly subdue Martin. Carol leaves Judith with Tyreese while she goes to help free the group. While she is <b>gone,</b> <b>a</b> group of walkers swarm {{the outside of the}} cabin. When Tyreese is distracted by the walkers, Martin grabs Judith and threatens to kill her unless Tyreese steps outside into the walker horde, unarmed. Tyreese does so but manages to survive and eliminate the walkers, then rushes inside to kill Martin, assuring Judith is unharmed.|$|E
