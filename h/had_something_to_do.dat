5|$|Cooperation did {{not long}} survive the war. Roosevelt died on 12 April 1945, and the Hyde Park Agreement was not binding on {{subsequent}} administrations. In fact, it was physically lost. When Wilson raised {{the matter in}} a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June, the American copy could not be found. The British sent Stimson a photocopy on 18 July 1945. Even then, Groves questioned the document's authenticity until the American copy was located years later in the papers of Vice Admiral Wilson Brown, Jr., Roosevelt's naval aide, apparently misfiled by someone unaware of what Tube Alloys was, who thought it <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with naval guns.|$|E
5|$|High {{school student}} Alex Browning boards Volée Airlines Flight 180 with his classmates for their senior trip to Paris, France. Before take-off, Alex has a premonition {{that the plane}} will suffer a catastrophic engine failure, causing the plane to explode mid-air and kill {{everyone}} on board. When the events from his vision begin to repeat themselves in reality, he panics and a fight breaks out between Alex and his rival, Carter Horton. This leads to several passengers being removed from the plane, including Alex; Carter; Alex's best friend, Tod Waggner; Carter's girlfriend, Terry Chaney; teacher Valerie Lewton; and students Billy Hitchcock and Clear Rivers. None of the passengers, except for Clear, believe Alex about his vision until the plane explodes on take-off, killing the remaining passengers on board. Afterwards, the survivors are interrogated by two FBI agents, who believe that Alex <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the explosion.|$|E

5|$|On 15 November 2004, Shaftesbury's Nice-based lawyer, Thierry Bensaude {{reported}} him missing, {{after being}} contacted by his girlfriend, Orche. The peer divided {{his time between}} the Riviera and a home in Hove, East Sussex. He had been due to return home on 10 November. After not hearing from Shaftesbury in a week, they remained concerned when he failed {{to return to his}} rented flat in Adelaide Crescent, Hove. Bensaude and Orche both expressed fears for his safety. Shaftesbury had been taking legal action in relation to the theft of some family antiques and artwork. Some friends and acquaintances mentioned that he had complained of money problems, so they surmised that his disappearance may have <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the theft and financial loss.|$|E

25|$|In 1972 the BBC {{terminated}} Bernard Braden's {{late night}} show, On the Braden Beat, {{replacing it with}} a similar programme, That's Life!, introduced by Esther Rantzen, who had worked with Braden. The reasons seem a little complicated and may have <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with Braden's contract to advertise margarine on ITV. However, although Braden himself was publicly circumspect about the decision, Kelly was forthright in condemning it and was plainly hostile towards Rantzen.|$|E
25|$|Dutch {{physicists}} Hendrik Casimir and Dirk Polder at Philips Research Labs {{proposed the}} existence of a force between two polarizable atoms and between such an atom and a conducting plate in 1947, this special form is called the Casimir–Polder force. After a conversation with Niels Bohr, who suggested it <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with zero-point energy, Casimir alone formulated the theory predicting a force between neutral conducting plates in 1948 which is called the Casimir effect in the narrow sense.|$|E

25|$|Some of La Fontaine's liveliest verses are {{addressed}} to the duchess Marie Anne Mancini, the youngest of Mazarin's nieces, and it is even probable that {{the taste of the}} duke and duchess for Ariosto <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the writing of his first work of real importance, the first book of the Contes, which appeared in 1664. He was then forty-three years old, and his previous printed productions had been comparatively trivial, though much of his work was handed about in manuscript long before it was regularly published.|$|E
25|$|Harald II died in 1018, and Cnut went to Denmark {{to affirm}} his {{succession}} to the Danish crown as Cnut II, stating {{his intention to}} avert attacks against England in a letter in 1019 (see above). It seems there were Danes in opposition to him, and an attack he carried out on the Wends of Pomerania may have <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with this. In this expedition, {{at least one of}} Cnut's Englishmen, Godwin, apparently won the king's trust after a night-time raid he personally led against a Wendish encampment.|$|E
25|$|In December 2006, two Nithari {{residents}} {{claimed they}} knew {{the location of the}} remains of children who had gone missing in the previous two years: the municipal water tank behind house D5.

The residents claimed they had been repeatedly ignored by local authorities; therefore, they sought the help of former Resident Welfare Association (RWA) President S C Mishra. That morning, Mishra and the two residents searched the tank drain. One of the residents claimed to have found a decomposed hand, after which they called the police.|$|E

25|$|A 13th century {{northern}} English source {{claims that}} William was Mormaer of Moray. As this source {{had no reason}} to deceive, it is highly likely that William was made the ruler of Moray after the defeat of King Óengus of Moray in 1130. It is feasible that this grant <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the coming of age of David's son, Prince Henry and may also be a factor in his marriage to a daughter of Óengus. As well as being the ruler of Moray, William controlled the English lands of Allerdale, Skipton and Craven, making him one of the greatest barons of northern England.|$|E
25|$|After Attlee and Greenwood left, Chamberlain asked whom {{he should}} {{recommend}} to the King as his successor. The {{version of events}} given by Churchill is that Chamberlain's preference for Halifax was obvious (Churchill implies that the spat between Churchill and the Labour benches the previous night <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with that); {{there was a long}} silence which Halifax eventually broke by saying he did not believe he could lead the government effectively as a member of the House of Lords instead of the House of Commons. Churchill's version gets the date wrong, and he fails to mention the presence of David Margesson, the government Chief Whip.|$|E
25|$|His death date, as {{mentioned}} above, {{derives from the}} Annals of Ulster, which notes s.a. 1020 Finnloech m. Ruaidhri, ri Alban, a suis occisus est, that is, that Findláech was killed by his own people. No {{reason for this is}} given, but the logical thing is to conclude that his successor, his nephew Máel Coluim mac Máil Brigti, <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it. Indeed, the Annals of Tigernach tell us that the sons of Máel Brigte were responsible; the only sons we know of are Máel Coluim and Gille Coemgáin, both of whom evidently benefited from the killing, as both succeeded to the throne.|$|E

25|$|In 1805, while a {{territorial}} legislator, Floyd {{became involved}} in the plot of Aaron Burr.

The company, believed to have <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the conspiracy, was to build a canal around the Falls of the Ohio on the Indiana side of the river. The company failed and the investors lost their money, which was believed to have been used to help finance Burr's plot. It was never proven that the money was stolen. The company had an initial investment of $120,000 and handled over one million dollars during its duration.|$|E
25|$|It {{might seem}} unusual that Hesiod's father {{migrated}} from Asia Minor westwards to mainland Greece, {{the opposite direction}} to most colonial movements at the time, and Hesiod himself gives no explanation for it. However around 750 BC or a little later, there was a migration of seagoing merchants from his original home in Cyme in Asia Minor to Cumae in Campania (a colony they shared with the Euboeans), and possibly his move west <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with that, since Euboea is not far from Boeotia, where he eventually established himself and his family. The family association with Aeolian Cyme might explain his familiarity with eastern myths, evident in his poems, though the Greek world might have already developed its own versions of them.|$|E
25|$|Miklos frequented the Académie de La Palette, {{where he}} learned Cubist techniques. There he {{studying}} under Henri Le Fauconnier, and later entered the studio of Jean Metzinger.

Shortly after the Armory Show in New York, Miklos participated in the Exhibition of Cubist and Futurist Pictures, Boggs & Buhl Department Store, Pittsburgh, July 1913. The exhibition included works by Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Jacques Villon, Fernand Léger, Pierre Dumont and Arpad Kesmarky. Sponsored by the Gimbel Brothers department store, the Cubist and Futurist show toured Milwaukee, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and New York from May through the summer of 1913.
