40|$|Clinical outcome {{following}} 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) intake {{ranges from}} mild entactogenic effects to a life-threatening intoxication. Despite ongoing research, the clinically most relevant mechanisms causing acute MDMA-induced adverse effects remain largely unclear. This complicates the triage {{and treatment of}} MDMA users needing medical care. The user's genetic profile and interactions resulting from polydrug use are key factors that modulate the individual response to MDMA and influence MDMA pharmacokinetics and dynamics, and thus clinical outcome. Polymorphisms in CYP 2 D 6, resulting in poor metabolism status, as well as co-exposure of MDMA with specific substances (e. g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)) can increase MDMA plasma levels, but can also decrease the formation of toxic metabolites and subsequent cellular damage. While pre-exposure to e. g. SSRIs can increase MDMA plasma levels, clinical effects (e. g. blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature) can be reduced, possibly due to a pharmacodynamic interaction at the serotonin <b>reuptake</b> <b>transporter</b> (SERT). Pretreatment with inhibitors of the <b>dopamine</b> or norepinephrine <b>reuptake</b> <b>transporter</b> (DAT or NET), 5 -HT(2 A) or α-β adrenergic receptor antagonists or antipsychotics prior to MDMA exposure can also decrease one or more MDMA-induced physiological and/or subjective effects.

40|$|Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease (PD) {{results from}} {{progressive}} degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Most PD cases are sporadic, but some have pathogenic mutation {{in the individual}} genes. Mutation of the leucine-rich repeat kinase- 2 (LRRK 2) gene is associated with familial and sporadic PD, as exemplified by G 2019 S substitution. While constitutive expression of mutant LRRK 2 in transgenic mice fails to induce neuron death, transient expression of the disease gene by viral delivery causes a substantial loss of dopaminergic neurons in mice. To further assess LRRK 2 pathogenesis, we created inducible transgenic rats expressing human LRRK 2 with G 2019 S substitution. Temporal overexpression of LRRK 2 (G 2019 S) in adult rats impaired <b>dopamine</b> <b>reuptake</b> by <b>dopamine</b> <b>transporter</b> (DAT) and thus enhanced locomotor activity, the phenotypes that were not observed in transgenic rats constitutively expressing the gene throughout life time.

40|$|Maternal obesity during {{pregnancy}} {{increases the risk}} of obesity in the offspring. Obesity, arising from an imbalance of energy intake and expenditure, can be driven by the ingestion of palatable [high fat (HF), high sugar], energy-dense foods. Dopamine and opioid circuitry are neural substrates associated with reward that can affect animals’ preference for palatable foods. Using a mouse model, the long-term effect of maternal consumption of a HF diet on dopamine and opioid gene expression within the mesocorticolimbic reward circuitry and hypothalamus of the offspring was investigated. Mice from dams fed a HF diet {{during pregnancy}} and lactation showed an increased preference for sucrose and fat. Gene expression, measured using quantitative real-time PCR, revealed a significant approximately 3 - to 10 -fold up-regulation of <b>dopamine</b> <b>reuptake</b> <b>transporter</b> (DAT) in the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, and prefrontal cortex and a down-regulation of DAT in the hypothalamus. Additionally, expression of both μ-opioid receptor (MOR) and preproenkephalin (PENK) was increased in nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex, and hypothalamus of mice from dams that consumed the HF diet. Epigenetic mechanisms have been associated with long-term programming of gene expression after various in utero insults. We observed global and gene-specific (DAT, MOR, and PENK) promoter DNA hypomethylation in the brains of offspring from dams that consumed the HF diet. These data demonstrate that maternal consumption of a HF diet can change the offsprings’ epigenetic marks (DNA hypomethylation) in association with long-term alterations in gene expression (dopamine and opioids) and behavior (preference for palatable foods) ...|$|E

40|$|Maternal {{consumption}} {{of a high}} fat diet during early development {{has been shown to}} impact the formation of hypothalamic neurocircuitry, thereby contributing to imbalances in appetite and energy homeostasis and increasing the risk of obesity in subsequent generations. Early in postnatal life, the neuronal projections responsible for energy homeostasis develop in response to appetite-related peptides such as leptin. To date, no study characterises the genome-wide transcriptional changes that occur in response to exposure to high fat diet during this critical window. We explored the effects of maternal high fat diet consumption on hypothalamic gene expression in Sprague Dawley rat offspring at postnatal day 10. RNA-sequencing enabled discovery of differentially expressed genes between offspring of dams fed a high fat diet and offspring of control diet fed dams. Female high fat diet offspring displayed altered expression of 86 genes (adjusted P-value< 0. 05), including genes coding for proteins of the extra cellular matrix, particularly Collagen 1 a 1 (Col 1 a 1), Col 1 a 2, Col 3 a 1, and the imprinted Insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf 2) gene.

40|$|Removal of intron {{sequences}} from pre-mRNA by splicing is {{an essential}} step in the expression of most human genes. Recursive splicing is a mechanistic variant shown to mediate the stepwise removal of very long introns and a subset of alternative splicing events in Drosophila melanogaster. Recursive splice sites (RSSs) consist of juxtaposed 3 ’ and 5 ’ splice site motifs that define a zero-nucleotide exon whose 3 ’ and 5 ’ splice sites are coincident. Only 10 - 20 % of RSSs in Drosophila are involved in alternative splicing, so most RSSs are non-exonic. Consequently, their biological role is unclear despite their high conservation and preferential association with long introns. Although RSSs can be predicted in human genes as well, their function has not been demonstrated. In this work, I study three problems: (1) How cis-elements contribute to {{the proper use of}} a non-exonic RSS. (2) The biological role of a non-exonic RSS in its natural context. (3) Verification of recursive splicing in human genes and some of its functional consequences. It is unclear how RSSs can function without interference between their 3 ’ and 5 ’ss components. The consensus RSS motif suggests that these elements are biased to function initially as a 3 ’ss due to enhanced features of the 3 ’ss component. In addition, most non-exonic RSSs are (surprisingly) associated with silent downstream 5 ’ss motifs at a position where they would be expected to define an exon. This could also help activate the RSS as a 3 ’ss by interaction with the non-overlapped 5 ’ss (“pseudo-exon definition”), but some mechanism would have to redirect splicing subsequently to the regenerated 5 ’ss rather than the downstream site. Intriguingly, the silent downstream 5 ’ splice sites are at a distance from the RSS where regular 5 ’ splice sites exhibit a peak in the distribution of enhancers. Experimental dissection of an example associated with non-exonic RSS RP 3 in the Ultrabithorax gene of Drosophila revealed that the downstream pseudo-­‐ 5 ’ss is not required for activation of the RSS as a 3 ’ss. Instead, it functions as part of a conserved module that stimulates use of the 5 ’ss that is regenerated by the RSS. This prevents inappropriate use of competing alternative and cryptic sites. The result is consistent with the hypothesis that the enhanced 3 ’ss component and branch site are sufficient to ensure their activity, but that activation of the regenerated 5 ’ss requires assistance. The regulatory function of the pseudo- 5 ’ss requires base-pairing with U 1 snRNA, even though splicing does not occur at this position. Similar modules may assist the efficient and correct sequential activity of many RSSs. These arrangments may reflect a dynamic evolutionary history of interconversions between exonic and nonexonic RSSs. To test the hypothesis that recursive splicing is important for the correct and/or efficient expression of genes with long introns, a two-step gene replacement strategy was used to delete the non-exonic RSS RP 3 from within a 50 kb intron in the endogenous Ultrabithorax gene and to generate isogenic wild-type control chromosomes. A change in the alternative isoform ratios was detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, and phenotypic analyses indicate that deletion of RP 3 leads to a mild loss of function. Additionally, a white marker gene inserted near RP 3 is profoundly silenced but can be reactivated by deletions extending upstream, suggesting a repressive chromatin structure in this region. A sample of predicted RSSs from human was tested using the same approaches as used previosuly in Drosophila. These tests made use of a recursive splicing reporter system or minigenes transfected into human cell lines. For three out of eight human RSS candidates tested, it was possible to detect the predicted recursive intermediates and a shift to use of an alternative 5 ’ss after mutation of the RSS 5 ’ss motif. A RSS associated with a novel ORF-truncating cassette exon (E 3 b) in the human <b>dopamine</b> <b>reuptake</b> <b>transporter</b> gene SLC 6 A 3 was also validated. Alternative splicing of exon E 3 b was verified in endogenous transcripts in the substantia nigra of adult human brain and in reporter and minigene transcripts in a transfected neuronal cell line. E 3 b is flanked by single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that appear to be associated with differential risk for schizophrenia. The risk-associated haplotype increases the inclusion of E 3 b in cell transfections assays and thus might be associated with reduced expression of <b>dopamine</b> <b>reuptake</b> <b>transporter</b> in vivo. An ORF-truncating exon E 3 b is present in all sequenced mammalian genomes except mouse, rat and rabbit, suggesting that recursive splicing of this cassette exon normally plays a role in regulating dopamine activity, and that genetically determined differences in regulation can underlie or exacerbate dopaminergic dysfunction...|$|E
