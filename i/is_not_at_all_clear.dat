5|$|Cross-linguistically, the-ma suffix may {{be related}} to a coverbial suffix in Jaminjung, a {{language}} in which coverb roots occur without any aspect markers, but are then suffixed with -mayan, which marks continuous aspect. This coverb suffix bears a striking resemblance to the sum of the Wagiman -ma suffix and the continuous aspect suffix -yan, which always occur in tandem on coverbs. Together, -ma and -yan perform the same semantic function as Jaminjung -mayan. Precisely what the relationship holds between these suffixes; whether one language borrowed from the other, or whether each language inherited them from earlier languages, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>clear.</b>|$|E

25|$|Acari (or Acarina) are a taxon of arachnids that {{contains}} mites and ticks. The {{diversity of the}} Acari is extraordinary and its fossil history goes back to at least the early Devonian period. As a result, acarologists (the people who study mites and ticks) have proposed {{a complex set of}} taxonomic ranks to classify mites. In most modern treatments, the Acari is considered a subclass of Arachnida and is composed of two or three superorders or orders: Acariformes (or Actinotrichida), Parasitiformes (or Anactinotrichida), and Opilioacariformes; the latter is often considered a subgroup within the Parasitiformes. The monophyly of the Acari is open to debate, and the relationships of the acarines to other arachnids <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>clear.</b> In older treatments, the subgroups of the Acarina were placed at order rank, but as their own subdivisions have become better understood, it is more usual to treat them at superorder rank.|$|E
25|$|As in Egypt and {{the eastern}} Mediterranean, {{radiocarbon}} dates run one or two centuries earlier than the dates proposed by archaeologists. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>clear</b> which group is right, if either. Mechanisms have been proposed for explaining why radiocarbon dates in the region might be skewed. Equally logical arguments have been made suggesting that the archaeological dates are too late. Time will tell. The spread of accelerator based carbon dating techniques may help clear up the issue. Another promising front is the dating of lime plaster from structures. Recently, radiocarbon dates from the final destruction of Ebla {{have been shown to}} definitely favour the middle chronology (with the fall of Babylon and Aleppo at c. 1595 BCE), and do not seem to fall with the ultra-low chronology (same event at c. 1499 BCE), although it is emphasized that this is not {{to be seen as a}} decisive argument.|$|E

The chicken may therefore use inductive reasoning to infer that the farmer will bring food every morning. However, one morning, the farmer comes and kills the chicken.

2500|$|In 2006, {{after the}} Jyllands-Posten Muhammad {{cartoons}} controversy, Harris wrote, [...] "The idea that Islam is a 'peaceful religion hijacked by extremists' {{is a dangerous}} fantasy—and {{it is now a}} particularly dangerous fantasy for Muslims to indulge. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>clear</b> how we should proceed in our dialogue with the Muslim world, but deluding ourselves with euphemisms is not the answer. [...] It now appears to be a truism in foreign policy circles that real reform in the Muslim world cannot be imposed from the outside. [...] But {{it is important to recognize}} why this is so—it is so because the Muslim world is utterly deranged by its religious tribalism. In confronting the religious literalism and ignorance of the Muslim world, we must appreciate how terrifyingly isolated Muslims have become in intellectual terms." [...] He states that his criticism of the religion is aimed not at Muslims as people, but at the doctrine of Islam.|$|E
2500|$|... central {{particle}} is zero. Assume [...] so that velocities {{are simply}} additive. [...] Fig.nbsp&5‑7b shows {{exactly the same}} setup, but {{in the frame of}} the upper stream. The test particle has a velocity of +v, and the bottom stream has a velocity of +2v. Since the physical situation has not changed, only the frame in which things are observed, the test particle should not be attracted towards either stream. But it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>clear</b> that the forces exerted on the test particle are equal. (1) Since the bottom stream is moving faster than the top, each particle in the bottom stream has a larger mass energy than a particle in the top. (2) Because of Lorentz contraction, there are more particles per unit length in the bottom stream than in the top stream. (3) Another contribution to the active gravitational mass of the bottom stream comes from an additional pressure term which, at this point, we do not have sufficient background to discuss. All of these effects together would seemingly demand that the test particle be drawn towards the bottom stream.|$|E

60|$|I {{have already}} {{declined}} {{to sign a}} petition {{for the removal of}} the stamp duty on newspapers. I think the reduced duty is some protection to the public against the rash and hasty launching of blackguard newspapers. I think the newspapers are made extremely accessible to the poor man at present, and that he would not derive the least benefit from the abolition of the stamp. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>clear</b> to me, supposing he wants The Times a penny cheaper, that he would get it a penny cheaper if the tax were taken off. If he supposes he would get in competition two or three new journals as good to choose from, he is mistaken; not knowing the immense resources and the gradually perfective machinery necessary to the production of such a journal. It appears {{to me to be a}} fair tax enough, very little in the way of individuals, not embarrassing to the public in its mode of being levied, and requiring some small consideration and pauses from the American kind of newspaper projectors. Further, a committee has reported in favour of the repeal, and the subject may be held to need no present launching.|$|E
60|$|From {{the analogy}} of birds, we should suppose that the pointed wing gave {{increased}} rapidity of flight, since it is a character of terns, swallows, falcons, and of the swift-flying pigeons. A short and rounded wing, on the other hand, always accompanies a more feeble or more laborious flight, and one much less under command. We might suppose, therefore, that the butterflies which possess this peculiar form were better able to escape pursuit. But there seems no unusual abundance of insectivorous birds to render this necessary; and as we cannot believe that such a curious peculiarity is without meaning, it seems probable {{that it is the}} result of a former condition of things, when the island possessed a much richer fauna, the relics of which we see in the isolated birds and Mammalia now inhabiting it; and when the abundance of insectivorous creatures rendered some unusual means of escape a necessity for the large-winged and showy butterflies. It is some confirmation of this view, that neither the very small nor the very obscurely coloured groups of butterflies have elongated wings, nor is any modification perceptible in those strong-winged groups which already possess great strength and rapidity of flight. These were already sufficiently protected from their enemies, and did not require increased power of escaping from them. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>clear</b> what effect the peculiar curvature of the wings has in modifying flight.|$|E
60|$|May 19th, Wednesday.--The {{connection}} {{of the old}} Hospitaller with the story <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>clear.</b> He is an American by birth, but deriving his English origin from the neighborhood of the Hospital, where he has finally established himself. Some one of his ancestors may have been somehow connected with the ancient portion of the story. He has been a friend of Middleton's father, who reposed entire confidence in him, trusting him with all his fortune, which the Hospitaller risked in his enormous speculations, and lost it all. His fame had been great in the financial world. There were circumstances that made it dangerous for his whereabouts to be known, and so he had come hither and found refuge in this institution, where Middleton finds him, but does not know who he is. In the vacancy of a mind formerly so active, he has taken {{to the study of}} local antiquities; and from his former intimacy with Middleton's father, he has a knowledge of the American part of the story, which he connects with the English portion, disclosed by his researches here; so that he is quite aware that Middleton has claims to the estate, which might be urged successfully against the present possessor. He is kindly disposed towards the son of his friend, whom he had so greatly injured; but he is now very old, and ------. Middleton has been directed to this old man, by a friend in America, as one likely to afford him all possible assistance in his researches; and so he seeks him out and forms an acquaintance with him, which the old man encourages to a certain extent, taking an evident interest in him, but does not disclose himself; nor does Middleton suspect him to be an American. The characteristic life of the Hospital is brought out, and the individual character of this old man, vegetating here after an active career, melancholy and miserable; sometimes torpid with the slow approach of utmost age; sometimes feeble, peevish, wavering; sometimes shining out with a wisdom resulting from originally bright faculties, ripened by experience. The character must not be allowed to get vague, but, with gleams of romance, must yet be kept homely and natural by little touches of his daily life.|$|E

6000|$|With 1716 {{we come to}} {{the alleged}} {{marriage}} with Stella. In 1752, seven years after Swift's death, Lord Orrery, in his Remarks on Swift, said that Stella was [...] "the concealed, but undoubted, wife of Dr. Swift.... If my informations are right, she was married to Dr. Swift in the year 1716, by Dr. Ashe, then Bishop of Clogher." [...] Ten years earlier, in 1742, in a letter to Deane Swift which I have not seen quoted before, Orrery spoke of the advantage of a wife to a man in his declining years; [...] "nor had the Dean felt a blow, or wanted a companion, had he been married, or, in other words, had Stella lived." [...] What this means <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>clear.</b> In 1754, Dr. Delany, an old friend of Swift's, wrote, in comment upon Orrery's Remarks, [...] "Your account of his marriage is, I am satisfied, true." [...] In 1789, George Monck Berkeley, in his Literary Relics, said that Swift and Stella were married by Dr. Ashe, [...] "who himself related the circumstances to Bishop Berkeley, by whose relict the story was communicated to me." [...] Dr. Ashe cannot have told Bishop Berkeley by word of mouth, because Ashe died in 1717, the year after the supposed marriage, and Berkeley was then still abroad. But Berkeley was at the time tutor to Ashe's son, and may therefore have been informed by letter, though it is difficult to believe that Ashe would write about such a secret so soon after the event. Thomas Sheridan, on information received from his father, Dr. Sheridan, Swift's friend, accepted the story of the marriage in his book (1784), adding particulars which are of very doubtful authenticity; and Johnson, in his Lives of the Poets, says that Dr. Madden told him that Stella had related her [...] "melancholy story" [...] to Dr. Sheridan before her death. On the other hand, Dr. Lyon, Swift's attendant in his later years, disbelieved the story of the marriage, which was, he said, [...] "founded only on hearsay"; and Mrs. Dingley [...] "laughed at it as an idle tale," [...] founded on suspicion.|$|E
