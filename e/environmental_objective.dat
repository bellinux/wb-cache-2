50|$|Metering {{of water}} supply is usually {{motivated}} {{by one or}} several of four objectives: First, it provides an incentive to conserve water which protects water resources (<b>environmental</b> <b>objective).</b> Second, it can postpone costly system expansion and saves energy and chemical costs (economic objective). Third, it allows a utility to better locate distribution losses (technical objective). Fourth, it allows to charge for water based on use, which is perceived {{by many as the}} fairest way to allocate the costs of water supply to users. Metering is considered good practice in water supply and is widespread in developed countries, except for the United Kingdom. In developing countries it is estimated that half of all urban water supply systems are metered and the tendency is increasing.|$|E

How the Swedish consumption pressures the global environment and methods to measure the affects was investigated. The pressure was divided into five main fields: climate, air, water, land and chemicals. The impacton humans and the biodiversity was also discussed, as well as differences between how men and women affect the environment and get affected when the environment changes. Chosen methods for calculating the impact {{had to be able}} to measure the pressure the Swedish consumption has on the environment, and thus humans and the biodiversity. The results show that the Swedish consumption has large internal and external impact on the environment. The methods that met the reports criteria and were analyzed were environmental input-output analysis, ecological footprint, water footprint, carbon footprint and environmental space. An earlier proposal for a seventeenth <b>environmental</b> <b>objective</b> was reviewed, called Restricted environmental pressure in other countries. In the discussion anew <b>environmental</b> <b>objective</b> was presented together with six stage goals. They were based o nthe main fields of environmental pressure. The measuring methods that were suitable and complete were suggested as indicators, namely ecological footprint and carbon footprint. To integrate the global aspect of the Swedish consumption with the environmental politics it’spossible to introduce a new <b>environmental</b> <b>objective.</b> Sustainable consumption is an attempt to do that...|$|E
40|$|Sustainable {{development}} includes environmental, {{social and}} economic dimension, which has become an accepted concept {{at all levels of}} society. There is also a need for these dimensions to integrate with each other. To attain a sustainable development it has {{to be seen as a}} whole. The <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives</b> were established by Swedish parliament in 1999; however these objectives are only one of the steps in achieving a sustainable society. Swedish municipality are forced to use the <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives</b> for guidance in planning society. Municipalities have a responsibility to integrate environmental issues into political processes and at the same time contribute to an increase of the awareness about these issues. There is no guidance in the work with the <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives</b> and municipality have to work on the basis of their own environment and conditions. The aim of this essay was to study the work of implementing <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives</b> in one municipality, with the focus on the objectives four and fifteen; towards an ecological sustainable development with support of the environmental work of another municipality. The focus of the work lays on the formulation of <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives</b> four and fifteen in order for them to be achieved without difficulty. One conclusion is that none of the chosen <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives</b> are reached. The theoretical discussion highlights the importance of a communicative work between different participants and also information about the environmental issues on the individual level.        This work was considered to contribute to future research concerning municipalities work with <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Along {{with the}} {{continuing}} global warming, the environmental constraints {{are expected to}} play more and more {{important role in the}} operation of distributed energy resource (DER) systems, besides the economic objective. In this study, a multi-objective optimization model is developed to analyze the optimal operating strategy of a DER system while combining the minimization of energy cost with the minimization of environmental impact which is assessed in terms of CO 2 emissions. The trade-off curve is obtained by using the compromise programming method. As an illustrative example, the DER system installed in an eco-campus in Japan has been selected for case study. The distributed technologies under consideration include photovoltaics (PV), fuel cell and gas engine for providing electrical and thermal demands. The obtained results demonstrate that increasing the satisfaction degree of economic objective leads to increased CO 2 emissions. The operation of the DER system is more sensitive when <b>environmental</b> <b>objective</b> is paid more attention. Moreover, according to the sensitivity analysis, the consideration of electricity buy-back, carbon tax, as well as fuel switching to biogas, has more or less effect on the operation of DER systems.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{motivated}} by the outlook of climate changes, expectations of more stormwater in the future, and {{the potential impact of}} stormwater on receiving waters. The study set out to investigate how Danish municipalities balance stormwater management with <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives</b> as set out by the WFD and national law. The general aim was to understand if the current stormwater management practice could impede compliance with <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives.</b> After an outline of the legal frames for the practice, an interview study about the practice, with seven municipal water managers from four different municipalities, who process discharge permits, was carried out. The qualitative data was analysed through a practice theoretical perspective {{in order to understand the}} water managers’ way of reasoning and how they balance the need of stormwater discharge with <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives.</b> Some of the main impediments to compliance with <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives</b> were found to be lack of environmental data on receiving waters and a lack of knowledge about the pollution profile of stormwater. These two elements have created a practice where a low-tech treatment/delay facility is required in permits but no further consistent monitoring of the discharge is carried out. However, uncertainties remain about the efficiency of available technology and whether the use of the technologies perceived as Best Available Technology (BAT) is sufficient to comply with <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives...</b>|$|R

40|$|Urine and faeces from humans {{contains}} {{a lot of}} nutrients. If the nutrients from on-site wastewater treatment are recycled, the risk of polluting recipient waters decreases. Recycling nutrients is also a way to contribute towards sustainability. Today the agriculture has {{a net loss of}} nutrients that is compensated with mineral fertilizers. This net loss of nutrients can be compensated with nutrients from faeces and urine instead. Sweden has a national <b>environmental</b> <b>objective</b> stating that "at least 60 % of phosphorus compounds present in wastewater should be recovered for use on productive land by 2015 and at least half of this amount should be returned to arable land". Source separated wastewater systems contribute to fulfil the Swedish <b>environmental</b> <b>objective</b> by collecting the nutrients in faeces and urine. These nutrients can be used as fertilizers after appropriate treatment. There is a potential hazard with pathogens, pharmaceuticals and heavy metals contained in these fertilizers. However the concentration of heavy metals and pharmaceuticals is lower in urine and faeces than in animal manure. If appropriate treatment for sanitising is used, the risk for pathogens is reduced. The products from source separated have a high potential to retain available plant nutrient resources and being able to substitute mineral fertilizer {{and at the same time}} prevent eutrophication...|$|E
40|$|The Federal State of Saxony (Germany) {{transposed}} the EU Water Framework Directive into state law, identifying 617 {{surface water}} bodies (rivers and streams) for {{implementation of the}} water framework directive (WFD). Their ecological status was classified by biological quality elements (macrophytes and phytobenthos, benthic invertebrates and fish, and in large rivers, phytoplankton) and specific synthetic and non-synthetic pollutants. Hydromorphological and physico-chemical quality elements were used to identify significant anthropogenic pressures, which surface water bodies are susceptible to, and to assess {{the effect of these}} pressures on the status of surface water bodies. In 2009, the data for classification of the ecological status and the main pressures and impacts on water bodies were published in the river basin management plans (RBMP) of the Elbe and Oder rivers. To that date, only 23 (4 %) streams achieved an ecological status of “good”, while the rest failed to achieve the <b>environmental</b> <b>objective.</b> The two main reasons for the failure were significant alterations to the stream morphology (81 % of all streams) and nutrient enrichment (62 %) caused by point (industrial and municipal waste water treatment plants) and non-point (surface run-off from arable fields, discharges from urban drainages and decentralized waste water treatment plants) sources.

40|$|In Tunisia, the {{extension}} of irrigated area is justified by its {{important role in the}} development and diversification of agricultural production. Nevertheless, the strong intensification of the agricultural activities may lead to the pollution of underground water resources due to an excess use of fertilisers and other chemical products. In fact, the high nitrate concentrations observed in some Tunisian irrigated areas, are related to the excessive use of nitrate fertilizers in intensive agriculture. The objective of the present study is to implement decision-making methods allowing a better combination of factors production by optimization of an economic objective and an <b>environmental</b> <b>objective.</b> This research is based on multi-criteria modelling through the optimization of two conflict objectives: an economic objective as settled by farmer in the short or medium-run (Gross margin), and an <b>environmental</b> <b>objective</b> (nitrate pollution reduction) as a long-run objective of the decision maker in order to ensure the continuity of agriculture activities and ecosystems sustainability. Data were collected through a survey conducted in the irrigated area of Kalaât El Andalous in Tunisia with a sample containing 57 farms. Efficient solutions were obtained and compared through the "constraints", "NISE" and "compromises" methods. Main results obtained indicate a significant degree of conflict between these two objectives. Indeed the maximization of the total gross margin involves an increase in the degrees of nitrate pollution and conversely. Finally, some policy implications are presented.
