2500|$|In {{contrast}} to his years as surgeon general, when it was his policies and speeches that had bearing on other people, his years as an operating pediatric surgeon involved a more individualized, direct, hands-on effect on others. [...] During {{the course of his}} long career, for example, he performed some seventeen thousand inguinal hernia repairs and over seven thousand orchidopexies (surgery for correcting undescended testicle). [...] He developed new procedures, such as the colon interposition graft for correcting <b>esophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> (congenital lack of continuity of the esophagus) or ventriculoperitoneal shunts for treatment of hydrocephalus (accumulation of excessive cerebral spinal fluid in and around the brain causing neurological problems). [...] He also tackled many difficult cases ranging from childhood cancer to surgeries done on conjoined twins, of which he and his colleagues operated upon ten pairs during his 35-year tenure.

2500|$|A {{review in}} 2013 {{came to the}} result that infants {{resulting}} from IVF (with or without ICSI) have a relative risk of birth defects of 1.32 (95% confidence interval 1.24–1.42) compared to naturally conceived infants. In 2008, {{an analysis of the}} data of the National Birth Defects Study in the US found that certain birth defects were significantly more common in infants conceived through IVF, notably septal heart defects, cleft lip with or without cleft palate, <b>esophageal</b> <b>atresia,</b> and anorectal atresia; the mechanism of causality is unclear. However, in a population-wide cohort study of 308,974 births (with 6163 using assisted reproductive technology and following children from birth to age five) researchers found: [...] "The increased risk of birth defects associated with IVF was no longer significant after adjustment for parental factors." [...] Parental factors included known independent risks for birth defects such as maternal age, smoking status, etc. Multivariate correction did not remove the significance of the association of birth defects and ICSI (corrected odds ratio 1.57), although the authors speculate that underlying male infertility factors (which would be {{associated with the use of}} ICSI) may contribute to this observation and were not able to correct for these confounders. The authors also found that a history of infertility elevated risk itself in the absence of any treatment (odds ratio 1.29), consistent with a Danish national registry study [...] and [...] "...implicates patient factors in this increased risk." [...] The authors of the Danish national registry study speculate: [...] "...our results suggest that the reported increased prevalence of congenital malformations seen in singletons born after assisted reproductive technology is partly due to the underlying infertility or its determinants." ...|$|E

The Authors Analyzed The Long-Term Survival Rate And Complications Of The Procedure In Children Operated On At The University Of Hong Kong Medical Centre Between 1979 And 2000. Methods: Seventy-Seven Consecutive Patients Were Analyzed By Retrospective Chart Review. The Patients Were Divided Into Groups According To Postoperative Bile Flow, Decade Of Operation, And Age At Operation. The Data Were Analyzed Statistically. Results: The Overall Actuarial Transplant-Free Survival Rate Was 68 % At 10 Years After Operation. For Patients With Poor, Partial, And Good Postoperative Bile Flow, Transplant-Free Survival Rate Was 0 %, 22 %, And 96 %, Respectively (P <. 001). Age And Decade Of Operation Were Not Significant Risk Factors. Esophageal Variceal Bleeding Occurred In 13 Patients And Was A Prognostic Indicator For End-Stage Liver Failure (P =. 044); The Poor Prognosis Of Patients With Variceal Bleeding, However, Was Related To Poor Or Partial Initial Bile Drainage.

Purpose: Whereas {{endoscopic}} balloon dilatation (EBD) of benign esophageal strictures is {{an established}} mode of therapy in adults, {{this has not}} been accepted universally in the pediatric population. The aim {{of this study is to}} report the safety, efficacy, and long-term results of EBD for children in the authors' center. Methods: Between 1986 and 2002, a total of 77 children (median age, 1. 8 years; range, 2 months to 20 years) were treated by EBD for various causes: 2 had achalasia, and 75 had <b>esophageal</b> strictures (postesophageal <b>atresia</b> repair, 63; reflux esophagitis, 7; postfundoplication, 2; caustic injury, 3). Dilatations were performed using flexible endoscopy and fluoroscopic screening under general anesthesia. Results: A total of 260 dilatations were carried out with the mean number of EBD per patient being 3. 4 (range, 1 to 19). A mean period of 5 months (maximum, 28 months) for each patient was required. Four complications of esophageal perforations (1. 5 %) were observed, but only one required surgical repair because of persistent leakage. The remaining patients have undergone long-term follow-up (median follow-up, 6. 6 years), and all are asymptomatic. Conclusions: This large series has shown that EBD can provide a safe and effective mean of relieving esophageal strictures with good long-term results. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|The {{research}} work reveals specific character of mechanical endurance of hollow organ walls of digestive tract (esophagus, stomach, {{small and large}} intestines), their deformability and hardness in children aged from the 1. day of life till 14 yrs. With {{the help of a}} special stand for biomechanical research of soft tissues, the analysis was made to detect the influence of an extension factor on the wall samples of children esophagus, stomach, small and large intestines. For investigations the autopsy material was used. The wall samples were obtained from hollow digestive tract organs in norm, or from various pathologies (atresia of esophagus, esophagitis, megacolon syndrome, Hirschsprung's disease). The highest wall endurance, deformability and hardness were observed in the cervical part of esophagus, the lowest - in the thoracic part. Anisotropy of biomechanical parameters of esophagus and gastric walls was determined. Several studies were done on newborns. As a result, there was observed a significant decrease of parameters of mechanical organ wall endurance, deformability and hardness in the neonatal group. There was detected the lack of anisotropy of small and large intestinal wall endurance and hardness. With the help of multi-factor dispersion analysis, the biomechanical properties of esophageal walls were found to depend on the direction of the extension, on the other hand, the endurance and hardness values of stomach, small and large intestinal walls were found to depend on the age factor. Biochemical content of children's hollow digestive organ walls was obtained. By means of electronic microscopy, it was possible to specify dilapidating character of esophagus, stomach, small and large intestinal wall structures, submitting samples to the extension factor. The studies proved that mechanical properties for endurance and hardness of gastric tract tissues were dependent on the architectonic dislocation, submucosal layer collagen and elastic fibre orientations of the organ walls. Correlation analysis of children stomach, small and large intestinal wall biomechanical, biochemical and structural parameters was made. On the basis of biomechanical, biochemical and structural research data, it was found that there existed biomechanical incompatibility of stomach, small and large intestinal material for the replacement of esophagus. Considering biomechanical research data as to the esophageal wall of full-term and pre-term neonates, it was suggested to take into mind the pre-term factor when constructing <b>esophageal</b> anastomosis in <b>atresias.</b> In cases of pre-term neonates, it is recommended to perform diagnostic esophageal intubation very carefully, using a soft catheter for this purpose. When assessing biomechanical findings of the large intestinal wall in norm and in pathology, it was advised to perform a radical resection of the part of the large intestine affected by pathology in cases of megacolon syndrome and Hirschsprung's diseaseAbstract in German, EnglishAvailable from Latvian Academic Library / LAL - Latvian Academic LibrarySIGLELVLatvi...|$|R
