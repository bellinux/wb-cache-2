500|$|Georges Rey and Michael Devitt {{reply to}} this {{objection}} by invoking deflationary semantic theories that avoid analysing predicates like [...] "x is true" [...] as expressing a real property. They are construed, instead, as logical devices so that asserting that a sentence is true {{is just a}} quoted way of asserting the sentence itself. To say, [...] "'God exists' is true" [...] is <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "God exists". This way, Rey and Devitt argue, insofar as dispositional replacements of [...] "claims" [...] and deflationary accounts of [...] "true" [...] are coherent, eliminativism is not self-refuting.|$|E
500|$|... "Battle of the Bastards" [...] {{was also}} the last episode for {{recurring}} character Rickon Stark (Art Parkinson), who had appeared since the series premiere episode [...] "Winter Is Coming". In an IGN interview, Parkinson {{said that he was}} tipped off about his character's death: [...] "Whenever I was told that I was coming back for Season 6, before they sent me through the scripts and stuff, they sent me through a ring <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'Listen, so that you don't get a shock whenever you read the scripts, just know that you die this season. He continued, [...] "Whenever I came back, I was excited to come back, and the scenes all seemed pretty amazing. I was so happy to re-embrace the character." [...] According to Parkinson, he was sorry that Rickon would die but his manner of death was a compensation: [...] "It was a cool death, and it was {{always going to be a}} good death, so at the same time, I was pretty happy." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{starts with}} [...] "Let Me Talk to You" [...] as the {{background}} is surrounded by faulty fluorescent lighting, turning on and off in a programmed pattern. It also begins with Timberlake and Timbaland chanting [...] "hey" [...] to one another. The video proceeds with Timberlake dancing {{to the beat of}} the song. Timbaland then begins singing the first verse of the song, which then is proceeded by Timberlake. This is immediately followed with [...] "My Love" [...] playing; the first verse of the song, [...] "Ain't another woman that could take your spot my", plays. Timberlake comes floating toward the camera, down the faulty fluorescent tube. Once Timberlake stops floating, he begins singing the main verse of the song, which violins begin to float swirling gently around him, for [...] "If I wrote you a symphony / <b>Just</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> how much you mean to me". The scene then changes with Timberlake and various dancers dancing accordingly in a choreographed style. When Timberlake begins the second verse, [...] "Now if I wrote you a love note / And made you smile at every word I wrote", pens and paper begin to float. This later exceeds with Timberlake singing [...] "This ring here represents my heart" [...] with a ring swirling into the camera. T.I. is then seen in the shot. T.I. begins rapping his lines in the song. After T.I. finishes his verse, Timberlake is then seen dancing with a female back-up dancer. Though, as they continue dancing, the female then leaves the shot, leaving Timberlake to dance {{to the end of the}} song. In the closing moments, the camera swirls around him, proving, conclusively, from every angle, that everyone has gone.|$|E

500|$|Nintendo Power named Kefka {{the best}} villain {{to appear on}} Nintendo {{consoles}} in 1994, ranking higher than Donkey Kong Countrys King K. Rool and Marvel Comics' Carnage. They again featured him in their January 2010 issue, ranking him as their third favorite Nintendo villain. He also was ranked 3rd place in the [...] "Our Favorite Villains," [...] section of their [...] "250 Reasons to Love Nintendo," [...] article. He was described as [...] "An insane, remorseless clown with godlike powers who wants to destroy everyone and everything (and comes frighteningly close to achieving his goal), Kefka is downright evil." [...] UGO.com named him third in their [...] "Top 25 Japanese RPG Characters" [...] article, stating [...] "Insane, nihilistic, and cruel, Kefka isn't a reserved mystery like other Final Fantasy villains – rather, he's in-your-face at all times, doing dirty deeds <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> he did them." [...] Digital Spy states that he caused {{some of the most}} surprising moments in the Final Fantasy series when he destroyed the world. IGN ranked him sixth on their list of the [...] "Top 25" [...] Final Fantasy characters of all time, noting that several factors, such as his dialogue and appearance, contributed to his memorability as a character; in a [...] "Reader's Choice" [...] edition of the article he placed eighth, with similar comments. He was also ranked 18th in IGN's [...] "Top 100 Videogame Villains" [...] list. GamePro ranked him 33rd on the top 47 most diabolical video game villains of all time, citing both his [...] "genocide" [...] and his enslavement of Terra. GamesRadar ranked him the most [...] "outrageous camp bad guys", stating that when compared to Kefka, Final Fantasy VII antagonist Sephiroth seems as interesting as a dead accountant painted brown. They also compared him to Batman antagonist the Joker, praising him for both his villainous ambition and his laugh. GameSpy declared that Kefka is quite possibly the greatest video game villain of all time.|$|E

In 1956 the Bolshoi invited Maksakova back, but her return was a one-off: she performed as Carmen, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> farewell to her fans. In her later years [...] Maksakova taught vocals at the Russian Academy of Theatre Arts (where she {{for many years}} held {{the position of a}} docent), {{was the head of the}} Folk vocal school in Moscow, published articles and essays.

2500|$|Barton started {{mixing the}} album in mid-April 2013, after the {{recording}} {{had just been}} finalized, and mixing was finished {{by the end of}} the month. It was then, that the album's short length, just 35 minutes and 3 seconds, surprised even the band: [...] "It wasn't until we got the masters sessions that we realized, 'Wow, this is like an old Van Halen record'..." [...] Wilton says that it wasn't possible for them to deliver more within the time frame they had, adding: [...] "To tell you the truth, we were at one point considering just doing 5 songs and doing an EP. But, basically, Century Media said it would be better if we could do an album." [...] Its length would later become a point of criticism, but Wilton has explained that the band prefers to choose quality over quantity: [...] "we don't want to have an album with filler songs. We want every song to be quality. I'd rather have a 35 minute badass album, than a 50 minute long with a bunch of epic songs that really shouldn't have been on the CD." [...] La Torre has added: [...] "We tend to focus on good content, we didn't want to have ten more minutes or fifteen more minutes of music, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that we could." ...|$|E
