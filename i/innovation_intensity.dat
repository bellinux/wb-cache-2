40|$|Abstract: We {{examine the}} impact of the {{strictness}} of employment protection legislation on <b>innovation</b> <b>intensity.</b> To this purpose, we use a panel of annual data from OECD countries over the period 1990 - 1999 and estimate difference-in-difference models to explain the variation of <b>innovation</b> <b>intensity</b> between industries within countries. Our estimates indicate that stricter employment protection legislation led to significantly lower <b>innovation</b> <b>intensity</b> in industries with higher job reallocation rates or higher layoff propensities. Further, we find that the strictness of employment regulations on the use of temporary contracts had a stronger impact on <b>innovation</b> <b>intensity</b> than the strictness of employment protection for regular contracts. Our findings are robust to additional industry covariates and to other labour market institutions that may affect innovation performance and industry job reallocation propensity.

40|$|While {{existing}} {{studies have}} provided many insightful {{discussions on the}} antecedents to innovative collaborations {{and the benefits of}} collaborative behavior, few studies have focused on the mediating role of innovative collaborations in enhancing the firm’s technological innovative performance. In this paper, we investigate the mediating role of the firm’s innovative collaborations in the relation between government innovation support and the firm’s product and process <b>innovation</b> <b>intensities.</b> As a mediating factor in the innovation process, innovative collaborations form part of the innovative inputs that contribute to the firm’s product and process <b>innovation</b> <b>intensities.</b> Using arguments derived from the resource-based theory, we found that while receipts of government innovation support help increase the firm’s level of innovative inputs as observed in its collaboration intensity, it is equally important for firms to internalize management practices that encourage maximum leverage of government innovation support for pursuits of innovative collaborations. In a similar vein, while innovative collaborations are necessary for realizing innovative outputs including product and process innovations, it is not a sufficient condition for achieving strong innovative performance. The firm’s internal capabilities as observed in its learning, R&D, resource allocation, manufacturing, marketing, organizing, and strategic planning abilities have a positive influence on the relationship between innovative collaborations and innovative outputs. ...|$|R

We present simple analytical results isolating the specific features and parameters of the model that play the key roles in shaping its quantitative implications for the aggregate impact of policy-induced changes in innovative investment in the short, medium and long term. We find that under the assumption of no social depreciation of innovation expenditures (a common assumption in Neo-Schumpeterian models), the model's implications for the elasticity of aggregate productivity and output over the medium-term horizon (i. e. 20 years) with respect to policy-induced changes in the <b>innovation</b> <b>intensity</b> of the economy are largely disconnected from the parameters that determine the model's long-run implications and the socially optimal <b>innovation</b> <b>intensity</b> of the economy.

The effects of firm size, cooperation in innovation, and government support make Canadian firms slightly more innovative than European firms, whereas the sectoral composition of output, the pressure of competition, the scope of innovation activities, and the novelty of innovation confer a slight advantage to Europe. ...|$|R

30|$|The {{following}} key {{findings of}} our analysis are particularly relevant for an accurate discussion of managerial implications. First, market orientation and entrepreneurial orientation {{have been found}} to be distinct constructs. Both are directly linked to <b>innovation</b> <b>intensity</b> and to different measures of performance. However, without further investigation of the paths to farm performance, these observations would be of mere descriptive value. So building on the first key result, the second one is that both market orientation and entrepreneurial orientation are indirectly—through innovation decisions—related to expected performance. The ability to identify these extended paths of indirect effects is one of the major advantages of the chosen approach of structural equation modelling. Although entrepreneurial orientation is positively related to both product and marketing <b>innovation</b> <b>intensity,</b> its impact is stronger on the latter. Additionally, we find that the effect of a market orientation is more strongly associated with the intensity of marketing innovations.|$|E

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire, in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy”. Entrepreneurial Orientation (EO) is a widely researched construct of corporate entrepreneurship. Despite long-standing research on EO, past studies on this construct {{have been unable to}} resolve issues related to its measurement. <b>Innovation</b> <b>Intensity</b> (II) is also a dynamic construct of corporate entrepreneurship but has received relatively less empirical attention. Previous research has reported an absence of an empirically validated quantitative scale of innovation, particularly <b>innovation</b> <b>intensity.</b> This research has addressed these gaps by proposing a refinement and validation of the Entrepreneurial Orientation scale and the development of an <b>Innovation</b> <b>Intensity</b> scale. The research proposes an Entrepreneurial Transformational Model (ETM) positing that EO impacts II. A predominantly quantitative research strategy supported by qualitative inputs, is employed to obtain empirical data from 404 corporate firms in Oman, drawing from a list of corporate firms registered with the Oman Chamber of Commerce and Industry. A mix of questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews was conducted with senior managers from firms representing various industries of the Omani corporate sector. Utilising exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and structural equation modelling (SEM), a two-stage data analysis approach was adopted. Measurement and structural models were developed for EO and II measures, while a complete SEM model was developed to test the causal relationship between EO and II. The results indicate that EO is a second-order construct consisting of five first-order factors, namely ready to innovate, competitive aggressiveness, autonomy, risk taking and proactiveness, which are its reflective components. Similarly, II is a second-order construct consisting of two first-order factors, namely degree and frequency of incremental and radical innovation, which are its reflective components. The II scale developed through this study allows corporate firms to assess their <b>innovation</b> <b>intensity</b> on a two-dimensional four-celled grid with varying levels of degree and frequency of innovation. Finally, EO is found to influence II and the entire relationship is posited as Entrepreneurial Transformation Model. This study, by addressing the empirical irregularities, has brought clarity to the measurement of EO and II constructs and is an original contribution to the advancement of theoretical knowledge and improvement in professional practice...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} model that links {{innovation}} effort to economic performance, {{along the lines of}} the Crépon et al (1998) model. However, in contrast to Crépon et al, that analyze R&D intensive manufacturing sectors, the present application examines the relationship between innovation and performance for services sectors. This is relevant since much effort has been made to explore that relationship for manufacturing but very little is known about it in the case of services sectors. In trying to fulfill this gap the paper uses firm-level data from the Second Community Innovation Survey to estimate a simultaneous equations model for firms in ten services sectors in Portugal. The present model also differs from former approaches by the specific explanatory structure proposed to estimate the complex relationship between innovation and economic performance. Instead of estimating a direct link between innovation and labor productivity, three specific relationships were put forward. The first of them explains the <b>innovation</b> effort <b>intensity</b> (an input in the innovation process). The second one relates service innovation (an output of the innovation process) to effort intensity and to other explanatory variables.
