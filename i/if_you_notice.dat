When people ask me which E.T. they should look at, I always tell them to look at the original 1982 E.T. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>notice,</b> when we did put out E.T. we put out two E.T.s. We put out the digitally enhanced version with the additional scenes and for no extra money, in the same package, we put out the original '82 version. I always tell people {{to go back to the}} '82 version.|$|E
25|$|I have an {{obsession}} with death and sex. Those two things are also the nexus of horror films, which I've been obsessing over lately. I’ve been watching horror movies and 1950s science fiction movies. My re-release is called The Fame Monster so I've just been sort of bulimically eating and regurgitating monster movies and all things scary. I've just been noticing a resurgence of this idea of monster, of fantasy, but {{in a very real}} way. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>notice</b> in those films, there’s always a juxtaposition of sex with death. That's what makes it so scary. Body and mind are primed for orgasm and instead somebody gets killed. That's the sort of sick, twisted psychological circumstance.|$|E
500|$|Thanks to {{developments}} in technology {{over the past}} few decades, consciousness has become a significant topic of interdisciplinary research in cognitive science, with significant contributions from fields such as psychology, anthropology, neuropsychology and neuroscience. The primary focus is on understanding what it means biologically and psychologically for information to be present in consciousness—that is, on determining the neural and psychological correlates of consciousness. [...] The majority of experimental studies assess consciousness in humans by asking subjects for a verbal report of their experiences (e.g., [...] "tell me <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>notice</b> anything when I do this"). [...] Issues of interest include phenomena such as subliminal perception, blindsight, denial of impairment, and altered states of consciousness produced by alcohol and other drugs, or spiritual or meditative techniques.|$|E

500|$|When Harry Manfredini {{began working}} on the musical score for the 1980 film, the {{decision}} was made to play the music only alongside the killer so as not to trick the audience into believing that the killer was around during moments that they were not supposed to be. Manfredini explains that the lack of music for certain scenes was deliberate: [...] "There's a scene where one of the girls [...] is setting up the archery area [...] One of the guys shoots an arrow into the target and just misses her. It's a huge scare, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>notice,</b> there's no music. That was a choice." [...] Manfredini also noted that when something was about to happen, the music would cut off so that the audience would relax a bit, which allowed the scare to become more effective.|$|E
500|$|On May 9, 2007, {{during a}} show in Fort Worth, Texas Chevelle's trailer {{containing}} all of the band's equipment was stolen from the hotel at which the members were staying. The band posted a notice saying, [...] "Most items are labeled 'Chevelle' and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>notice</b> anything suspicious on eBay or other online resellers selling 'authentic' Chevelle items... guitar, basses, drums, amplifiers, risers, backdrops, tee shirts... please call the police..." [...] A month later in an interview, Sam Loeffler stated, [...] "Of the 14 guitars, we got two of 'em, {{and then we got}} some amplifiers back and our monitor system. So it's really, I mean it's cool because it's kind of like Christmas, only really weird. People have been calling us and saying, 'Hey, I bought this or that', and you know, we're just doing our best to buy it back from them. And certainly the issue is not a money issue, it's about having the pieces of gear that you did all your records with." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "So <b>you</b> <b>noticed</b> that much, did you?" [...] cried Jenny. [...] "It does you credit, Peter. It does you credit. I wonder <b>if</b> <b>you</b> also <b>noticed</b> Whip-poor-will's whiskers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Alan. But do {{you think}} that Jeekie quite understands the meaning of an oath? I mean it seems so strange that we should never have found the {{slightest}} trace of him, and, Alan, I don't know <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>noticed</b> it, but why did Jeekie appear that morning wearing Lord Aylward's socks and boots?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The master warmed {{beneath his}} copper-coloured rind. 'O no, miss; that one you {{saw was a}} cutter--a smaller boat altogether,' he replied. 'Built on the sliding-keel principle, you understand, miss--and red below her water-line, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>noticed.</b> This is Lord Mountclere's yacht--the Fawn. You might have seen her re'ching in round Old-Harry Rock this morning afore we started.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Regardless of {{who decided}} on the title, Lennon {{immediately}} {{made up his mind}} that he would compose the movie's title track. He dashed off the song in one night, and brought it in for comments the following morning. [...] As he described in his 1980 Playboy interview, [...] "the next morning I brought in the song … 'cuz there was a little competition between Paul and I as to who got the A-side – who got the hits. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>notice,</b> in the early days the majority of singles, in the movies and everything, were mine … in the early period I'm dominating the group … The reason Paul sang on 'A Hard Day's Night' (in the bridge) is because I couldn't reach the notes." [...] However, Paul McCartney and others remember Paul collaborating on the song, though John was the dominant writer.|$|E

6000|$|... "You're getting quite smart," [...] said Harry with a grin. [...] "I don't know <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>noticed</b> it, but <b>you</b> trod on {{a rotten}} branch that smashed. He didn't {{want us to}} know him again, but I'd pick that fellow {{anywhere}} by his back and walk. Now why was he so anxious that we shouldn't see him talking to the Chinaman?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{there is}} a strong strain of madness in our family. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> haven't <b>noticed</b> it {{yourself}} all your friends must have." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Wah, wah, God is great," [...] {{said the}} Professor. [...] "But it isn't {{in human nature}} {{for a man who}} sprawls about on soft mats by {{instinct}} to wear Europe clothes as though they belonged to him. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>notice,</b> the last thing that they take to is shoes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] I explained, [...] "it {{is not a}} well-made chair. These rockers are too short, {{and they}} are too curved, and one of them, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>notice,</b> {{is higher than the}} other and of a smaller radius; the back is at too obtuse an angle.

6000|$|... "I {{can make}} out her figurehead, too," [...] he said. [...] "It is a saint, though I don't know what saint; but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>notice,</b> sir, you will see that, instead of {{standing}} nearly upright, he leans much more forward than usual. I remember the captain saying {{he looked as if}} he was going to take a header. So with that, and the stern gallery, there is no possibility of mistaking her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, he is a {{grand old}} fellow, one of the best, but like most other people he has his little weaknesses, and when the fit is on him he can put away a {{surprising}} amount of liquor. I tell you so that {{you should not be}} astonished <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>notice</b> anything, or try to argue with him when he is in that state, as then his temper is apt to be--well, lively. Now I must go and give him a pint of warm milk; that is his favourite antidote, and in fact the best there is." ...|$|E
60|$|JOHNNY. [coming forward again] Now {{that the}} Governor has given himself away, {{and the old}} lady's gone, I'll tell you something, Lord Summerhays. If you study men whove made an {{enormous}} pile in business without being keen on money, youll find that they all have a slate off. The Governor's a wonderful man; but hes not quite all there, you know. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>notice,</b> hes different from me; and whatever my failings may be, I'm a sane man. Erratic: thats what he is. And {{the danger is that}} some day he'll give the whole show away.|$|E

60|$|Once {{there was}} a bad little boy whose name was Jim--though, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>notice,</b> <b>you</b> will find that bad little boys are nearly always called James in your Sunday-school books. It was strange, but still it was true, that this one was called Jim.|$|R
60|$|<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>notice</b> the {{direction}} of his bill as it enters the water, you can tell fairly well about where he will come up again. It was confusing at first, in chasing him, to find that he rarely came up where he was expected. I would paddle hard in {{the direction}} he was going, only to find him far to the right or left, or behind me, when at last he showed himself. That was because I followed his body, not his bill. Moving in one direction, he will turn his head and dive. That is to mislead you, if you are following him. Follow his bill, as he does himself, and you will be near him when he rises; for he rarely turns under water.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] murmured Smither in the hall, {{where the}} air had the {{singular}} freshness of the outside day, [...] "we haven't been very satisfied with him, not all this week. He's always been one to leave a titbit to the end; but ever since Monday he's been eating it first. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>notice</b> a dog, Mr. Soames, at its dinner, it eats the meat first. We've always thought it such a good sign of Mr. Timothy at his age to {{leave it to the}} last, but now he seems to have lost all his self-control; and, of course, it makes him leave the rest. The doctor doesn't make anything of it, but"--Smither shook her head--"he seems to think he's got to eat it first, in case he shouldn't get to it. That and his talking makes us anxious." ...|$|E
60|$|About an {{hour after}} dinner {{everybody}} was dozing around, some in their chairs and some in their rooms, and {{it got to be}} pretty dull. Buck and a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep. I went up to our room, and judged I would take a nap myself. I found that sweet Miss Sophia standing in her door, which was next to ours, and she took me in her room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I liked her, and I said I did; and she asked me if I would do something for her and not tell anybody, and I said I would. Then she said she'd forgot her Testament, and left it in the seat at church between two other books, and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her, and not say nothing to nobody. I said I would. So I slid out and slipped off up the road, and there warn't anybody at the church, except maybe a hog or two, for there warn't any lock on the door, and hogs likes a puncheon floor in summer-time because it's cool. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>notice,</b> most folks don't go to church only when they've got to; but a hog is different.|$|E
6000|$|She {{began at}} once, while she did {{something}} to her hair before the morsel of mirror: [...] "Why I wanted to know <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had <b>noticed</b> those people was {{because they are the}} reason of his being here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Duke of Berwick {{has sent}} me to ascertain, sir, the {{position}} of a strong body of the enemy's troops, whom he observed marching from the river towards our right. May I ask <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have <b>noticed</b> them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, don't talk of accomplishments! I learnt my {{profession}} in Paris. For nigh on three years I lived among the French medical students. Noticing this {{book on the}} table, I thought I would try whether I had forgotten the language--in the time that has passed (you know) since those days. Well, my memory isn't a good one in most things, but strange to say (force of habit, I suppose), some of my French sticks by me still. I hope I see you well, Miss Henley. Might I ask <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>noticed</b> the new address, when I sent up my card?" ...|$|R
