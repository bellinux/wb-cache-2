40|$|AbstractWe {{tried to}} control the {{distribution}} of the <b>demagnetizing</b> field inside magnetoimpedance elements fabricated using thin-film to gain higher sensitivity. Elements with quasi-ellipsoidal shape were adopted to modify the <b>demagnetizing</b> field distribution, because {{it is well known that}} the <b>demagnetizing</b> field is expected to be uniform in an ellipsoid. The larger impedance change and higher sensitivity were obtained in the ellipsoidal elements compared to those of the conventional rectangular elements. The observed results were analyzed by the calculations on the basis of {{the distribution of the}} <b>demagnetizing</b> field and the impedance profile without <b>demagnetizing</b> effect. The calculations well explained the experimental results: the improvement of sensitivity and the performance for the ellipsoidal elements is attributed to the uniform distribution of <b>demagnetizing</b> field. The experimental results demonstrate a potential and the calculation results contribute to optimum design, for a miniaturization of magnetoimpedance element in order to keep the higher sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{influence}} of surface/interface roughness on the <b>demagnetizing</b> factor of a thin magnetic film with a single or a double boundary of self-affine, mound or anisotropic roughness. For a film with a single self-affine rough boundary, the in-plane <b>demagnetizing</b> factor Nxx(yy) {{is proportional to the}} interface width w square and to the leading order is inversely proportional to the lateral correlation length ξ. The roughness exponent α is also shown to greatly affect Nxx(yy). For a film with a single mound boundary, Nxx(yy) is inversely proportional to the apparent correlation length, and also depends on the ratio of the two different lateral lengths: the average mound separation λ and the randomness correlation length ζ. It is also shown that an anisotropic surface morphology can induce anisotropic in-plane <b>demagnetizing</b> factors. The <b>demagnetizing</b> anisotropy can be magnified by a morphological anisotropy. Furthermore, we consider films with two rough boundaries. Besides a general formalism derived for the <b>demagnetizing</b> factor, we investigate how the cross correlation of the two rough boundaries affects the in-plane <b>demagnetizing</b> factors. Connections between the <b>demagnetizing</b> factor and thin-film growth mechanisms are also discussed. ...|$|R
2500|$|During {{their time}} with EMI Records the band {{consistently}} experienced troubles with their contract: upon their initial negotiations only {{three members of}} the group (Rowland, Archer and Geoffrey [...] "Jeff" [...] Blythe), called the [...] "nucleus", were signed to the label, which caused a stir within the group. They were also only being paid 6% of the royalties, whereas most bands receive 10–12%. This led to Rowland threatening to steal the album from the studio and hold it ransom until their pay was increased, which EMI laughed at. However, {{on the last day of}} mixing the record, while Wingfield was out of the studio to get a cup of coffee, the members of the group locked the door to the studio, each taking a carton of magnetic tape and ran through the building to their getaway vehicle, a Morris Minor which belonged to Saunders' girlfriend, and drove to Rowland's parents' house in Birmingham. EMI demanded the tapes back but the band had already set off on their sell-out UK tour. The band gave the tapes back when EMI raised their pay to 9%, but they almost destroyed them by travelling through the London Underground, which could have <b>demagnetized</b> them and wiped everything.|$|E
2500|$|Modern driver magnets {{are almost}} always {{permanent}} and made of ceramic, ferrite, Alnico, or, more recently, rare earth such as neodymium and samarium cobalt. Electrodynamic drivers were often used in musical instrument amplifier/speaker cabinets well into the 1950s; [...] there were economic savings in those using tube amplifiers as the field coil could, and usually did, do double duty as a power supply choke. A trend in design — due to increases in transportation costs and a desire for smaller, lighter devices (as in many home theater multi-speaker installations) — {{is the use of}} the last instead of heavier ferrite types. Very few manufacturers still produce electrodynamic loudspeakers with electrically powered field coils, as was common in the earliest designs; [...] one of the last is a French firm. When high field-strength permanent magnets became available after WWII, Alnico, an alloy of aluminum, nickel, and cobalt became popular, since it dispensed with the problems of field-coil drivers. Alnico was used almost exclusively until about 1980, despite the embarrassing problem of Alnico magnets being partially degaussed (i.e., <b>demagnetized)</b> by accidental 'pops' or 'clicks' caused by loose connections, especially if used with a high-power amplifier.

[...] "By what accident," [...] asks the Quarterly Reviewer (George Agar Ellis), [...] "has it happened that no other English poet before Lord Byron has thought fit to employ his talents on a subject so well suited to their display?" [...] The question can only be answered by the assertion that it was the accident of genius which inspired the poet with a [...] "new song." [...] Childe Harold's Pilgrimage had no progenitors, and, with the exception of some feeble and forgotten imitations, it has had no descendants. The materials of the poem; the Spenserian stanza, suggested, perhaps, by Campbell's Gertrude of Wyoming, as well as by older models; the language, the metaphors, often appropriated and sometimes stolen from the Bible, from Shakespeare, from the classics; the sentiments and reflections coeval with reflection and sentiment, wear a familiar hue; but the poem itself, a pilgrimage to scenes and cities of renown, a song of travel, a rhythmical diorama, was Byron's own handiwork--not an inheritance, but a creation.|$|E
