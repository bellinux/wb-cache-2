Researchers of the Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute first quantified data about solitary bottlenose dolphin diving behavior in the presence and absence of boats.

25|$|The main {{disadvantages}} of the side-lever engine were {{that it was}} large and heavy, and for inland waterway and coastal service, it was soon replaced by lighter and more efficient designs. It remained the dominant <b>engine</b> <b>type</b> for oceangoing service {{through much of the}} first half of the 19th century however, due to its relatively low centre of gravity which gave ships more stability in heavy seas. It was also a common early <b>engine</b> <b>type</b> for warships, since its relatively low height made it less susceptible to battle damage. From the first Royal Navy steam vessel in 1820 until 1840, 70 steam vessels entered service, the majority with side-lever engines, using boilers set to 4psi maximum pressure. The low steam pressures dictated the large cylinder sizes for the side-lever engines, though the effective pressure on the piston was the difference between the boiler pressure and the vacuum in the condenser.|$|E
25|$|The nacelle {{was built}} in 1928 by the Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH for the LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin (Count Zeppelin). The {{propulsion}} system of this airship consisted of five nacelles fixed to the hull. Every nacelle contained a Maybach <b>engine,</b> <b>type</b> VL 2, which drove a propeller at the nacelle’s tail. A mechanic was stationed at each engine at all times.|$|E
25|$|The company {{encountered}} {{financial problems}} however, and in 1936 the Triumph bicycle and motorcycle businesses were sold, {{the latter to}} Jack Sangster of Ariel to become Triumph Engineering Co Ltd. Healey purchased an Alfa Romeo 8C 2300 and developed a new car model with an Alfa inspired straight-8 <b>engine</b> <b>type</b> named the Triumph Dolomite. Three of these cars were made in 1934, {{one of which was}} used in competition and destroyed in an accident. The Dolomites manufactured from 1937 to 1940 were unrelated to these prototypes.|$|E

25|$|The Cruiser was re-designed as the Spartan Cruiser II, {{featuring}} a modified fuselage and cockpit. The first Cruiser II (G-ACBM) flew in February 1933, powered by Cirrus Hermes IV engines, and G-ACKG/VT-AER also used that <b>engine</b> <b>type.</b> Most Spartan-built Cruiser IIs were powered by three Gipsy Major engines, but G-ACOU/OK-ATM was powered by Walter Major engines. In 1933 and 1934, twelve Cruiser IIs were built by Spartan, five {{of which were}} exported. Just one licence-built Cruiser II (YU-SAP) was built in Zemun, Yugoslavia, by , in 1935.|$|E
25|$|After the Vanderbilt takeover, an {{increasing}} {{percentage of the}} company's contracts came from Vanderbilt himself, who from this point had most of his new steamboats and steamships engined there, just as most of his shipbuilding contracts {{went to the same}} firm, that of his trusted nephew, Jeremiah Simonson. Vanderbilt brought his own ideas to the field of marine steam engineering. Defying the prevailing wisdom, he began powering oceangoing steamships with American walking beam engines, believing that their relative lightness of construction, economy of operation and low maintenance requirements made them preferable to the low center-of-gravity, but more complex, British-designed side-lever and oscillating types. Other American marine engine manufacturers quickly followed his example, and walking beams became the preferred <b>engine</b> <b>type</b> for oceangoing American sidewheel steamships until the introduction of the much more economical surface condensing compound engine in the early 1870s.|$|E
25|$|Following the corporations' intervention, BEA Airtours {{acquired}} seven former BOAC Boeing 707-436s. These aircraft had {{a greater}} seating capacity than required and were powered by four Rolls-Royce Conway engines, an older generation <b>engine</b> <b>type</b> than the four Pratt and Whitney JT3D turbofans which powered the ex-American 707-123Bs it had originally selected to replace its Comet fleet. This meant that the ex-BOAC 707s had higher operating costs. However, BOAC was prepared to sell these aircraft to BEA Airtours {{at a lower price}} than American was asking for its planes. The £4.3m sale price included BOAC's entire spares holding (inclusive of engines) for the seven aircraft. This helped compensate for the cost differential. The first of these 174-seat aircraft entered service in 1971 while the last aircraft of this batch joined the fleet in 1973. By that time, four of the airline's nine Comet 4Bs had already been withdrawn from service and sold to rival British charter airlines.|$|E
50|$|Inherent safety: Because a bell-type expander-cycle {{engine is}} thrust limited, it {{can easily be}} {{designed}} to withstand its maximum thrust conditions. In other <b>engine</b> <b>types,</b> a stuck fuel valve or similar problem can lead to engine thrust spiraling out of control due to unintended feedback systems. Other <b>engine</b> <b>types</b> require complex mechanical or electronic controllers to ensure this does not happen. Expander cycles are by design incapable of malfunctioning that way.|$|R

500|$|Over {{the course}} of the design process that {{continued}} through 1916, the size of the projected cruisers increased as the navy added new design requirements. This resulted in the FK 2 design. The length increased to [...] overall and [...] at the waterline. Their beam increased to , as did their draft, to [...] Their displacement correspondingly rose to [...] at normal load and [...] at combat load, significantly greater than the original design. The FK 2 design was armed with five 15cm SK L/45 guns and two 8.8cm SK L/45 anti-aircraft guns. It was to carry the same 60cm torpedo tubes in twin mounts as the earlier designs. The design retained the same propulsion system as the earlier designs, but with an improved <b>engine</b> <b>type</b> and an additional boiler, which produced an estimated [...] for a top speed of 32knots. Range was to have been 2,800miles at 17knots, as in the original design.|$|E
500|$|The {{first two}} {{locomotives}} operated {{on the line}} were 0-4-0 single-cylinder geared steam locomotives of the traction <b>engine</b> <b>type</b> built by Aveling and Porter, works numbers 807 and 846. A crankshaft drove a [...] flywheel which in turn drove chains attached to the wheels. They were delivered in 1872, and numbered 1 & 2. Following the 1894 authorisation of the rebuilt line to operate as a railway, both locomotives failed to meet minimum speed requirements for railway operations. Both were sold on 23 September 1895 to the Heyford Iron Company in Northamptonshire. No.2 {{was found to have}} a faulty boiler, and was used as a source of spares for No.1. By 1922 the Heyford Iron Company had developed a brickworks, and No1 was used for haulage there until the closure of the brickworks in 1940. In the 1950s No.1 was restored by London Transport at Neasden Depot, and was transferred to the Clapham Museum of British Transport on 19 January 1957. It was displayed there until March 1973, when it was transferred to the London Transport Museum. Since then it has been displayed at the London Transport Museum and at the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre at Quainton Road.|$|E
