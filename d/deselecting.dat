50|$|Four {{years after}} {{initially}} <b>deselecting</b> Barber, the Liberal Party readopted {{him at the}} 1875 election, thus preventing Lyon from contesting the riding of Halton {{on behalf of the}} party. However, in June 1875, Barber's re-election to a third term in office was deemed void in a subsequent election trial that had been brought about by petition. With Barber's unseating, the Liberal Party convened to determine a new candidate in the consequential by-election; on October 4, they chose Lyon. He went on to be elected Member of the 3rd Parliament of Ontario in the following month, defeating the Conservative candidate Col. William Clay by 1363 votes to 1196.|$|E

In the lead-up to the 2016 parliamentary election he moved against key members of the pro-Roh faction in the nominations process, <b>deselecting</b> Lee Hae-chan, who had been Prime Minister under Roh and was now chairman of the Roh Moo-hyun Foundation. Lee left the party in response. Kim's moves proved controversial, and many of his nominations for the party's proportional representation list were rejected {{by the rest of the}} party leadership, while favored candidates of Moon were ranked near the top of the approved list. Kim offered to resign in March, but decided to stay on as leader after a personal visit from Moon. Kim affirmed that he would continue to attempt to change the party's image, stating that the events had shown the party was [...] "still unable to move on from its old ways".|$|E
50|$|In all {{vehicles}} using {{a transmission}} (virtually all modern vehicles), {{a coupling device}} is used to separate the engine and transmission when necessary. This is because an internal-combustion engine must continue to run when in use, although a few modern cars shut off the engine when the vehicle is stationary. The clutch accomplishes this in manual transmissions. Without it, the engine and tires would at all times be inextricably linked, and any time the vehicle stopped, the engine would stall. Without the clutch, changing gears would be very difficult, even with the vehicle moving already: <b>deselecting</b> a gear while the transmission is under load requires considerable force (and risks significant damage). As well, selecting a gear requires the revolution speed of the engine {{to be held at}} a very precise value which depends on the vehicle speed and desired gear - the speeds inside the transmission have to match. In a car, the clutch is usually operated by a pedal; on a motorcycle, a lever on the left handlebar serves the purpose.|$|E

This was brought to public attention by BBC TV's Have I Got News for You programme, broadcast on 22 May 2009, when the studio audience showed their opinion by booing Gray. He had met Mrs Mayo, then Director of the Countryside Alliance's pro-hunting campaign, while organising Conservative opposition to the anti-hunting bill. The affair attracted national press attention when Mrs Mayo's husband, the barrister Rupert Mayo, wrote to a local newspaper, the Wiltshire Gazette and Herald, [...] "The irony is that I will not reap the benefits of Mr Cameron's excellent family-based policy proposals because one of his own MPs has ripped my own family apart." [...] The local Conservative association subsequently considered <b>deselecting</b> Gray as their parliamentary candidate, but in January 2007, after a secret ballot of all local party members, decided to confirm him as the Conservative candidate for North Wiltshire.|$|E
50|$|Married {{with three}} children, Pin first {{worked as a}} social worker and also worked for the Valencian {{regional}} administration before entering politics in 1995 when she was elected as a councillor for Sagunto and also served {{as a member of the}} Valencian Regional assembly from 1995 to 1996. She entered national politics in 1996 when she was elected to the Congress of Deputies as a deputy for Valencia. For the 2000 election she was placed lower down the PSOE list in seventh place in a district where the party had won only six seats at the previous election. With the PSOE failing to gain a seat she consequently lost her seat but returned to the Congress in June 2003 as a substitute candidate. She was re-elected in 2004 and was the most active PSOE deputy in the three Valencian provinces in the first 21 months of the Congress being credited with 346 legislative interventions. Despite this, for the 2008 election she was placed ninth on the PSOE list (the party had won seven seats at the 2004 election) effectively <b>deselecting</b> her as the party was unable to gain any seats in that election. With the replacement of Inmaculada Rodríguez-Piñero by José Luís Ábalos Meco in April 2009, she is currently first in line to substitute any PSOE deputy for Valencia Province who resigns or dies.|$|E

In a simple model {{we show that}} the power of elections as a selection and incentive device can be improved by requiring higher vote thresholds than 50 % for incumbents. A higher vote threshold makes it impossible for office-holders of low ability to pool with more able office-holders in order to be reelected. As a consequence, the average ability of reelected politicians and the average effort level tends to increase. The socially optimal threshold can be set by the public. Alternatively, one could allow candidates to compete with individual vote thresholds. effort; elections; incumbents; political contracts; selection; vote-share thresholds...|$|E
30|$|CSA {{is based}} on a Best-First Search schema (Pearl 1984) that {{performs}} a systematic search over an abstract structure called state-space graph. In our case, this structure is a binary tree where nodes are valid states of the problem (partial and full configurations) and edges represent individual selection/deselection of features. From a given initial partial configuration that represents the root of the tree-like state-space graph, the algorithm generates new nodes by selecting and <b>deselecting</b> features. It uses an heuristic function to estimate the objective function value of these nodes in order to drive the search towards the optimal (or sub-optimal) solution, and a container (OPEN set) for storing and ordering the visited nodes. The algorithm succeeds when it reaches a full configuration (goal node).|$|E
