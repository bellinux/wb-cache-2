5|$|Both asexual {{and sexual}} spores or sporangiospores are often {{actively}} dispersed by forcible <b>ejection</b> from their reproductive structures. This <b>ejection</b> ensures exit of the spores from the reproductive structures {{as well as}} traveling through the air over long distances. Specialized mechanical and physiological mechanisms, as well as spore surface structures (such as hydrophobins), enable efficient spore <b>ejection.</b> For example, {{the structure of the}} spore-bearing cells in some ascomycete species is such that the buildup of substances affecting cell volume and fluid balance enables the explosive discharge of spores into the air. The forcible discharge of single spores termed ballistospores involves formation of a small drop of water (Buller's drop), which upon contact with the spore leads to its projectile release with an initial acceleration of more than 10,000g; the net result is that the spore is ejected 0.01–0.02cm, sufficient distance for it to fall through the gills or pores into the air below. Other fungi, like the puffballs, rely on alternative mechanisms for spore release, such as external mechanical forces. The bird's nest fungi use the force of falling water drops to liberate the spores from cup-shaped fruiting bodies. Another strategy is seen in the stinkhorns, a group of fungi with lively colors and putrid odor that attract insects to disperse their spores.|$|E

50|$|Coronal mass <b>ejections</b> {{often appear}} with {{other forms of}} solar activity, most notably solar flares, but no causal {{relationship}} has been established. Most weak flares do not have CMEs; most powerful ones do. Most <b>ejections</b> originate from active regions on the Sun's surface, such as sunspot groupings associated with frequent flares. Other forms of solar activity frequently associcated with coronal mass <b>ejections</b> are eruptive prominences, coronal dimming, coronal waves and Moreton waves, also called solar tsunami.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The Coronal Mass <b>Ejections</b> (CMEs) {{generally}} {{occur in}} large numbers {{during the period of}} high solar activity carry large amount of plasma and contain high magnetic field having the capability to produce interplanetary disturbances. Many early studies indicated that Coronal Mass <b>Ejections</b> are usually associated with a decrease in Cosmic Ray Intensity (CRI) called Forbush Decrease (Fds). A statistical analysis has been made to obtain the relationship between Coronal Mass <b>Ejections</b> and Forbush Decreases for the period of 2000 to 2010 covering the solar cycle 23 and recent period of solar cycle 24.

40|$|We present SOHO EIT, UVCS and LASCO {{observations}} of recurrent (6 [...] - 8 events per day) narrow (angular widths of about 3 [...] - 10 degrees) Coronal Mass <b>Ejections</b> (CMEs) which occurred over 2002 November 26 [...] 29. The active region where the <b>ejections</b> originate {{is near the}} base of a coronal streamer that appears to be unperturbed by the events and keeps stable in time; hence we interpret the observed events as a new class of recursive narrow CMEs that we call "streamer puffs. " EIT 304 angstrom (He II) images indicate that the puffs result from compact ejective flares embedded in the streamer, with the <b>ejections</b> from the flares having velocities 100 [...] - 200 kilometers per second. Most <b>ejections</b> are closely correlated with coronal "jets" seen at 1. 7 solar radii in the UVCS data, and a subset of these <b>ejections</b> and jets correspond to streamer puffs observed in LASCO coronagraph images. There are, however, more compact flares and jets than streamer puffs during the observation period, indicating that only a subset of the flare-associated <b>ejections</b> are energetic enough to escape into the heliosphere...|$|R

40|$|More than 30 {{instances}} of sudden mass <b>ejections</b> {{from the sun}} were observed with the white light coronagraph experiment aboard Skylab during the first 118 days of the mission. Typically, these <b>ejections</b> appear as large magnetic loops rooted at the sun, yet expanding outward through the solar corona at speeds {{of the order of}} 400 km/sec. The loops always appear to retain their magnetic connection to the sun. Eighteen of these <b>ejections</b> were associated with active and eruptive prominences and surges; only three <b>ejections</b> appear to have been flare initiated. Associations with ground-detected metric wavelength type 2 and 4 radio bursts occur for about 30 % of these events; however, ground-detected type 2 and 4 radio bursts originating near the limb are almost invariably accompanied by coronagraph-observed <b>ejections.</b> Pressure or MHD waves run out ahead of the transient material ejecta; at times these waves can be detected by their effects on nearby coronal structures...|$|R
40|$|<b>Ejections</b> {{from the}} Sun can be {{observed}} with a higher resolution {{than in any other}} astrophysical object: can we build up on solar results and apply them to astrophysical objects?

Briefly reviewing jets properties from these objects and from the Sun, we point out some characteristics they share and indicate research areas where cross-breeeding between astrophysical and solar research is likely to be productive. Preliminary results of this study suggest, for instance, that there may be an analogy between blobs created by tearing instability in current sheets (CSs) associated with solar coronal mass <b>ejections</b> (CMEs) and quasi periodic <b>ejections</b> of plasma associated with large radio outbursts in microquasars.

40|$|From 2007 - 2011 Major League Baseball (MLB) {{managers}} were exceedingly ejected {{more often than}} head coaches of the three other major American sports combined. By and large, managerial <b>ejections</b> exist as rational choices wholly dependent on the manager's reaction to an umpire's decision. This choice manifests itself through professional baseball's historical structure {{as a means to}} influence future umpire judgment and is examined quantitatively through economic reasoning, cognitive impairment, frustration, and momentum shift models. The findings indicate that <b>ejections</b> occurred mostly at home towards the later stages of a game when teams were losing. Regression analyses indicate that <b>ejections</b> themselves have a nominal effect on attendance, and that attendance itself is mostly dependent on a team's brand and in-season performance. When controlling for each team, it was determined that <b>ejections</b> are mainly symbolic acts of frustration with a team's previous win/loss ratios, had some effect on future win/loss ratios, with slight evidence that manager <b>ejections</b> can have a slight effect on reversing a team's negative momentum...|$|R

40|$|Using {{proxy data}} for the {{occurrence}} of those mass <b>ejections</b> from the solar corona which are directed earthward, the association between the post- 1970 interplanetary magnetic clouds of Klein and Burlaga (1982) and coronal mass <b>ejections</b> is investigated. The evidence linking magnetic clouds following shocks with coronal mass <b>ejections</b> is striking; six of nine clouds observed at earth were preceded an appropriate time earlier by meter-wave type II radio bursts indicative of coronal shock waves and coronal mass <b>ejections</b> occurring near central meridian. During the selected control periods when no clouds were detected near earth, the only type II bursts reported were associated with solar activity near the limbs.
