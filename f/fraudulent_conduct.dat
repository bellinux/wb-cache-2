Indeed, the 2015 reform introduced a specific cause of non-punishment that makes not rise the criminal sanction for those taxpayers who, except in case of specific <b>fraudulent</b> <b>conducts,</b> have taken steps to pay debts before the opening of the dispute at the criminal trial.

The facts in all the precedents the majority relied on, even Whitaker, [...] " [...] demonstrate a much closer relationship between the offense not charged but proved {{in the course of}} trial and the offense charged than can be discerned between odometer alteration and mail fraud," [...] he wrote.

2500|$|McCormick {{was sentenced}} to 10 years' {{imprisonment}} on 2 May 2013. In passing sentence, Mr. Richard Hone said: [...] "Your <b>fraudulent</b> <b>conduct</b> in selling so many useless devices for simply enormous profit promoted {{a false sense of}} security and in all probability materially contributed to causing death and injury to innocent individuals." [...] The judge noted that McCormick had not expressed any remorse or recognition of wrongdoing and said that his [...] "culpability as a fraudster has to be placed in the highest category." [...] Brigadier Simon Marriner told the court that the ADE 651 was clearly implicated in failing to prevent bomb attacks: [...] "The inescapable conclusion is that devices have been detonated after passing through checkpoints. Iraqi civilians have died as a result." [...] McCormick's application for an appeal against his sentence was rejected by the Court of Appeal, with Judge Elgan Edwards stating: [...] "The circumstances were quite appalling. The applicant knew precisely what he was doing. He did it for enormous profit and that conduct simply cannot and will not be tolerated." [...] The judge commented that [...] "if this case does not merit the maximum possible sentence, I don't know what does." [...] McCormick was subsequently ordered to forfeit £7,944,834 under a proceeds of crime order to recompense the organisations defrauded by him, including £2.3 million to repay Iraq.|$|E

On 27 November, the Moldovan Government, headed by Prime Minister Iurie Leancă, secretly decided to bail out the three banks with $870 million in emergency loans, covered from state reserves. This created a deficit in Moldovan public finances equivalent to an eighth of the country's GDP.|$|R

That from the son set forth that Mr Clennam would, he knew, be gratified to hear that he had at length obtained permanent employment of a highly satisfactory nature, accompanied with every prospect of complete success in life; but that the temporary inability of his employer to pay him his arrears of salary to that date (in which condition said employer had appealed to that generous forbearance in which he trusted he should never be wanting towards a fellow-creature), combined with the <b>fraudulent</b> <b>conduct</b> of a false friend and the present high price of provisions, had reduced him to the verge of ruin, unless he could by a quarter before six that evening raise the sum of eight pounds. This sum, Mr Clennam {{would be happy to}} learn, he had, through the promptitude of several friends who had a lively confidence in his probity, already raised, {{with the exception of a}} trifling balance of one pound seventeen and fourpence; the loan of which balance, for the period of one month, would be fraught with the usual beneficent consequences.|$|E

50|$|In {{the initial}} months of 1989, the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR) tried {{in vain to}} {{postpone}} the election date, arguing that the deadline for electoral registration restricted citizen participation. In December 1988, the party's delegation in Congress had managed to amend the electoral law of 1986. Arguing that the new registration requirements, which limited registration to citizens who possessed cédulas de identidad (national identity cards), constituted a violation of universal suffrage, the MNR pushed through legislation that added birth certificates and military service cards as valid registration documents. Nationalist Democratic Action (ADN) refused to go along with its ally and eventually charged the MNR with <b>conducting</b> <b>fraudulent</b> registrations.

50|$|A {{victim of}} {{misleading}} or deceptive conduct is only entitled to damages (i.e., monetary compensation) {{if they have}} suffered loss or damage {{as a result of}} the conduct. The measure of loss or damage here is generally the same as it is in contract law or tort law. Since 2004, if a victim contributed to the loss or damage that they suffered, then the court can reduce the amount of damages that they are awarded, in a similar fashion to the reduction of damages in a negligence claim if the plaintiff is guilty of contributory negligence. However, if the person engaging in the conduct intended to mislead or deceive, or was <b>fraudulent</b> in their <b>conduct,</b> then the courts cannot reduce the damages.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the long-term outcome for military trainees referred for a mental health evaluation during basic training. Participants were 261 Air Force basic trainees seen for a mental health evaluation during January through October 1997 and returned to duty. Frequency and type of discharge from the military were documented for participants during a 4 -yearfollow-up period. The results showed that two-thirds of the study sample failed to complete their obligated tour of duty. Most discharges occurred within a 100 -day period from the time of the evaluation. Common discharge types were physical condition interfering with performance of duty, entry-level performance and <b>conduct,</b> <b>fraudulent</b> entry, and character or behavior disorder.

40|$|Online {{auction and}} {{shopping}} are gaining popularity {{with the growth}} of web-based eCommerce. Criminals are also taking advantage of these opportunities to <b>conduct</b> <b>fraudulent</b> activities against honest parties with the purpose of deception and illegal profit. In practice, proactive moderation systems are deployed to detect suspicious events for further inspection by human experts. Motivated by real-world applications in commercial auction sites in Asia, we develop various advanced machine learning techniques in the proactive moderation system. Our proposed system is formulated as optimizing bounded generalized linear models in multi-instance learning problems, with intrinsic bias in selective labeling and massive unlabeled samples. In both offline evaluations and online bucket tests, the proposed system significantly outperforms the rule-based system on various metrics, including area under ROC (AUC), loss rate of labeled frauds and customer complaints. We also show that the metrics of loss rates are more effective than AUC in our cases...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{recent case}} of Engelbrecht NO and Others v Zuma and Others [2015] 3 All SA (GP) {{deals with the}} {{application}} of section 424 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973 dealing with the personal liability of directors and others for the <b>fraudulent</b> or reckless <b>conduct</b> in the carrying on {{of the business of}} the company. This takes into account the relevance and applicability of section 424 in view of the promulgation of the Companies Act 71 of 2008, which came into effect in May of 2011. The approach adopted is that of looking at the requirements that give rise to personal liability by taking into account the provisions of legislation, literature and previous decisions by the courts on the matter. Our courts continue {{to protect the rights of}} creditors against unscrupulous directors or individuals who knowingly participate in carrying on of the business of the company in a manner prohibited by law.

40|$|The {{issue of}} legal {{jurisdiction}} {{is considered an}} integral part of sovereignty and one in which States naturally assume responsibility to adjudicate on matters and persons within their territorial boundaries. Except by mutual consent, no State is allowed to undermine the sovereign authority of another by enacting and applying its laws to matters and persons within the jurisdiction of that other State except in circumstances permitted under conflict of law principles. However, global expansion of commerce, flourishing of multinational corporations, and technological revolution, has not only increased international transaction in securities, but also market abuses, fraud and manipulative conduct associated with domestic securities markets have spread across borders. So, instead of jurisdiction based on conventional principles, a State justify extraterritorial application of its national securities regulation if the abusive, <b>fraudulent</b> or manipulative <b>conduct</b> of foreign persons imposes negative externalities on the State, its economy, and investors.
