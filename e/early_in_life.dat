5|$|A line of rats with {{hereditary}} kidney cancer {{were developed}} by Japanese researchers.

Heterozygotes have renal abnormalities seen very <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>life</b> that develop into clear cell and hybrid tumors, significantly shortening the animals' lifespan; they also are prone to endometrial and salivary gland clear cell hyperplasia as well as rhabdomyolysis. Homozygotes do not survive to birth. When a wild-type FLCN gene was added, the phenotype was rescued.|$|E
5|$|Each {{of these}} {{positive}} outcomes requires some ability to forgo short-term reward {{in favor of}} a higher payoff in the future. The ability to delay gratification also appears to be a buffer against rejection sensitivity (the tendency to be anxious when anticipating interpersonal rejection). In a 20-year follow-up of the marshmallow experiment, individuals with vulnerability to high rejection sensitivity who had shown strong delay of gratification abilities as preschoolers had higher self-esteem and self-worth and more adaptive coping skills, in comparison to the individuals who had high rejection sensitivity but low delay of gratification as four-year-olds. These compelling longitudinal findings converge with other studies showing a similar pattern: The ability to resist temptation <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>life</b> translates to persistent benefits across settings.|$|E

Young hamsters provided widely varied diets <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>life</b> are less likely to suffer digestive problems as they mature, but this is not always possible in the wild due to lack of food; this causes the life expectancy of captive hamsters to be greater than that of wild hamsters.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Age polyethism is {{widespread}} among social insects and, as a rule, safe tasks are performed by workers <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>life</b> than are risky ones. Mathematical models {{were used to}} compare expected longevity of workers in colonies with and without age polyethism. The results of the models suggest that if aging {{does not depend on}} activity then age polyethism is profitable when safer tasks are performed <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>life.</b> If, however, aging depends on activity, age polyethism is profitable when safer tasks are performed <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>life</b> and if they are associated with higher aging-related mortality. On the other hand, age polyethism is not profitable if safer tasks are performed later <b>in</b> <b>life,</b> and if they are associated with lower aging-related mortality. Furthermore, if there is no aging, then age polyethism does not bring any benefits. Electronic supplementary material to this paper can be obtained by using the Springer Link server located a...|$|R

Garrard's mother died sometime between 1755 and 1760; afterward, his father married Elizabeth Moss, and the couple had four more children. William Garrard was the county lieutenant of Stafford County, by virtue of which he held the rank of colonel and was {{in command of the}} county militia. The Garrard family was moderately wealthy, and the Stafford County courthouse was built on their land. During his childhood, James worked on his father's farm. He was educated in the common schools of Stafford County and studied at home, acquiring a fondness for books. <b>Early</b> <b>in</b> <b>life,</b> he associated himself with the Hartwood Baptist Church near Fredericksburg, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Purportedly born in Weston on the {{outskirts}} of Bath, Ælfheah became a monk <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>life.</b> His birth took place around 953. He first entered the monastery of Deerhurst, but then moved to Bath, where he became an anchorite. He was noted for his piety and austerity, and rose to become abbot of Bath Abbey. The 12th century chronicler William of Malmesbury recorded that Ælfheah was a monk and prior at Glastonbury Abbey, but this is not accepted by all historians. Indications are that Ælfheah became abbot at Bath by 982, perhaps as early as around 977. He perhaps shared authority with his predecessor Æscwig after 968.|$|E

His stand-up gigs in inner-city pubs did not provide him with enough income to support himself, however, so he continued his work as a barman and waiting tables.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to examine how {{background}} factors, such as abuse <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>life,</b> affect depression and suicidal behavior, amongst persons who abuse alcohol or illicit drugs. The study was performed at the Social Service Center, Södermalm, department for adults. The data used in the study is based on Addiction Severity Index interviews (ASI) and includes 560 observations. The statistic methods used to analyse the data is chi² test and the result is presented in cross tables and charts. The main findings were that experiences of psychological, physical, or sexual abuse, <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>life</b> increase the risk for major depression and suicidal behavior later <b>in</b> <b>life.</b> The experience of major depression, amongst persons who had been abused psychologically, physically or sexually, <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>life</b> also increased the risk for suicide thoughts and suicide attempts. The findings also indicated that those with parents who`s had problems with their psychological health were a risk group for suicide thoughts. As for suicide attempt there was no correlation between this and the parent`s problems with alcohol/drugs or psychological health. Gender did not seem to be a significant factor for depression or suicidal behavior with in the group that has been abused. With in the whole studied group, on the other hand, women were more commonly depressed, had suicide thoughts and more often made suicide attempts, than men. Women in the group also had more experiences of psychological, physical, or sexual abuse, <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>life...</b>|$|R

5|$|There is {{no known}} cure for {{multiple}} sclerosis. Treatments attempt to improve function after an attack and prevent new attacks. Medications {{used to treat}} MS, while modestly effective, can have side effects and be poorly tolerated. Physical therapy can help with people's ability to function.

The long-term outcome is difficult to predict, with good outcomes more often seen in women, those who develop the disease <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>life,</b> those with a relapsing course, and those who initially experienced few attacks. Life expectancy is on average 5 to 10 years lower than that of an unaffected population.|$|E
5|$|Brain AVMs may be {{detected}} on computed tomography angiography (CTA or CT angio) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA); CTA is better in showing the vessels themselves, and MRA provides more {{detail about the}} relationship between an AVM and surrounding brain tissue. In general, MRI is recommended. Various types of vascular malformations may be encountered: AVMs, micro-AVMs, telangiectasias and arteriovenous fistulas. If surgery, embolization, or other treatment is contemplated (see below), cerebral angiography may be required to get sufficient detail of the vessels. This procedure carries a small risk of stroke (0.5%) and is therefore limited to specific circumstances. Recent professional guidelines recommend that all children with suspected or definite HHT undergo a brain MRI <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>life</b> to identify AVMs that can cause major complications. Others suggest that screening for cerebral AVMs is probably unnecessary in those who are not experiencing any neurological symptoms, because most lesions discovered on screening scans would not require treatment, creating undesirable conundrums.|$|E
5|$|Dow {{struggled}} {{to conform to}} the tenets of his parents' Quaker faith; he was hot-tempered and enjoyed brawling from a young age. As he became wealthy later in life, he enjoyed wearing fine clothes, contrary to the Quakers' preference for plain dress. Some of his family's other virtues, such as thrift and abstinence from alcohol and tobacco, he adopted <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>life.</b> When he turned eighteen, Dow sought to avoid the required militia musters, more out of distaste for the drunkenness that they often involved than out of Quaker belief in pacifism. Instead, he joined the volunteer fire department, whose members were exempted from the muster. In 1827, Dow lobbied the Maine legislature to reform the fire companies to increase their efficiency. That same year, he argued against his fire company serving alcohol at its anniversary celebration; the members compromised, and served only wine, not hard liquor. At times Dow let his politics interfere with his duties; after being promoted to fire chief, he allowed a liquor store to burn to the ground.|$|E
