25|$|A typical TAG student takes English 1 Pre-AP as a freshman, English 2 Pre-AP as a sophomore, AP English Language and Composition as a junior, and AP English Literature and Composition as a senior. In addition, {{students}} are required to take a semester of Communication Applications (Speech) as a freshman and Independent Study English as a senior. The Texas Education Agency mandated that all TAG students in Texas must submit an “Exit-Level Project” during their senior year. This project requires finding a mentor in the community, researching and developing the project, and submitting the finished project to a set of judges at the state level. The projects are graded on a “1” to “5” scale, with “5” being the highest. The student must score a “3” or higher to graduate with a “TAG” endorsement on their diploma. TAG's Independent Study English course is this exit-level project. In addition to the required courses, students <b>have</b> <b>choices</b> of the following electives: Debate and Humanities (World Studies/Philosophy).|$|E
2500|$|Following her divorce, Jackson {{decided to}} record an uptempo, optimistic album rather than songs about sadness or anger. Producer Jimmy Jam said, [...] "You {{go through all}} these {{emotions}} and then {{you come out of}} it {{on the other side and}} say, [...] "I'm going to be okay and I have a lot of things to be thankful for,' and that was the overriding feeling in her life when we were making this album." [...] Its concept focuses largely on the demise of her marriage to René Elizondo, Jr. and subsequent embrace of the single life, experiencing dating for the first time. It also contains themes of sensuality, deceit, and betrayal. Jackson said, [...] "It’s a different thing for me. Growing up, I never dated. I’m doing that now, experiencing that whole life." [...] Its upbeat tempo intended to reflect Jackson's self-esteem, described as [...] "a work in progress." [...] Jam commented, [...] "She doesn't see herself the way other people see her. You know...gorgeous and sexy and all that. That isn't the kind of person she is. Although she is closer to feeling like that person now than she was 15 years ago. Or even three of four years ago." [...] Jackson commented, [...] "I look back at pictures of myself from four years ago and I see the unhappiness in my eyes. But I'm in the greatest space now... I believe we <b>have</b> <b>choices</b> and paths, and it's about choosing the right path, the promising path." [...] While recording, Jackson listened to artists such as St. Germain, Buena Vista Social Club, Thievery Corporation, Basement Jaxx, Outkast and Papa Roach.|$|E

2500|$|Final Fantasy All the Bravest was [...] {{critically}} panned. [...] Critics {{mainly focused}} on the [...] "poorly and greedily structured in-app purchases" [...] and [...] "shallow" [...] gameplay. IGN gave the game a [...] "poor" [...] rating, stating that despite {{a small amount of}} nostalgia, the game was ultimately criticized for its [...] "insulting in-game purchases and inexcusably mindless & repetitive gameplay", ultimately concluding that it was a [...] "very disappointing black mark on Square-Enix’s long-running franchise." [...] Pocketgamer strongly criticized the gameplay and in-app purchase system stating, [...] "There's hardly a game here to begin with - it's more a series of flashing lights to try and entice you to throw some cash down, cross your fingers, and hope {{you end up with a}} character you like." [...] Slide to Play criticized the game for having [...] "No rhyme, reason, or strategy to gameplay; the game is a thinly-disguised piggy bank for in-app purchases." [...] Digital Spy echoed the criticisms on the method of in-app purchases and poor gameplay, stating that it was [...] "almost a parody of the worst examples of free-to-play games" [...] and criticizing [...] "its reliance on predatory in-app purchases that exist solely to make loyal fans waste their money. As a free-to-play cash grab it would have still held some appeal, but the core gameplay is just too shallow without significant rewards to make it even worth the price of admission." [...] 1UP.com also stated, [...] "ATB is essentially a narrow tunnel you blindly run down, and where games typically <b>have</b> <b>choices</b> for you to make -- whether it be what skill to choose, what weapon to pick up, what player to substitute in, what kind of unit to build, or whatever else -- there is nothing here." [...] In a rare move, IGN issued a public service announcement not to buy the game, and later cited the game for making money despite bad reviews and high prices. Pocket Tactics also gave a similar public service announcement to not buy the game stating, [...] "I have been an apologist in the past for Square Enix’s unusually high price points for its Final Fantasy iOS ports. [...] Developers have to make money, and no one should begrudge that. But the way that All The Bravest goes about it is so gauche, so ill-mannered, that it can only be interpreted as a measure of Square Enix’s disdain for its own fans." [...] Kotaku stated that the game is emblematic of Square Enix's lack of respect for fans, and a desire to milk the franchise for money. GamesRadar ranked it as the 44th worst game ever made. The staff accused its developers of cashing in on the Final Fantasy brand. US Gamer cited the game as being the most notable misstep Square Enix had done since CEO Yosuke Matsuda took over, though it also noted that the project had begun under the previous CEO Yoichi Wada.|$|E

40|$|Although policy emphasises the {{benefits}} of choice, an increasing body of work points to times when choice may not always have positive consequences. The present experimental study aimed to explore the impact of choice {{on a number of}} patient outcomes in the health care setting. The study also explored {{the extent to which the}} influence of choice was affected by patient uncertainty and anticipated regret. Choice was conceptualised as consisting of two dimensions: 'having choice' which reflects the availability of a number of options and 'making choice' reflecting resolution and a desire for a choice to be made. Consecutive patients (n = 427) from four General Practices in Surrey were asked to read one of 16 vignettes which varied in terms of four independent variables (<b>having</b> <b>choice,</b> making choice, uncertainty, anticipated regret) and to rate items relating to four outcome variables (patient satisfaction, perceived control, negative emotions, information seeking). The results showed that <b>having</b> more <b>choice</b> was consistently associated with more positive patient outcomes than <b>having</b> no <b>choice.</b> <b>Having</b> no <b>choice</b> was particularly detrimental for those experiencing anticipated regret and uncertainty. In contrast, whether or not a <b>choice</b> was made <b>had</b> no impact upon any of the outcome measures. In line with current policy <b>having</b> <b>choice</b> in the health care setting is related to improved patient outcomes. The results provide some insights into the factors which influence the direction of the impact of choice. They also indicate the importance of differentiating between 'having choice' and 'making choice'...|$|R
