5|$|Al-Qaeda under Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's {{leadership}} launched coordinated {{explosions in}} three hotel lobbies in Amman on 9 November 2005, resulting in 60 deaths and 115 injured. The bombings, which targeted civilians, caused widespread outrage among Jordanians. The attack {{is considered to}} be a rare event in the country, and Jordan's internal security was dramatically improved afterwards. No major terrorist attacks have occurred since then. Abdullah and Jordan are viewed with contempt by <b>Islamic</b> <b>extremists</b> for the country's peace treaty with Israel and its relationship with the West.|$|E
5|$|Season 8, set 18 months later, {{begins at}} 4:00p.m. Jack is {{brought in by}} CTU to uncover a Russian plot to assassinate Islamic leader Omar Hassan during peace {{negotiations}} with U.S. President Taylor. Russia's contingency plan involves engineering a dirty bomb, which <b>Islamic</b> <b>extremists</b> threaten to detonate unless Hassan is handed over. Jack seeks retribution for personal losses suffered after Charles Logan convinces Taylor to cover up these crimes to protect the peace agreement. Jack finds himself at odds with both the Russian and American governments.|$|E
5|$|For the 2004–05 {{academic}} year, Abdulmutallab {{studied at}} the San'a Institute for the Arabic Language in Sana'a, Yemen, and attended lectures at Iman University. He began his studies at University College London in September 2005, where {{he was president of}} the school's Islamic society in 2006 and 2007, during which time he participated in, along with political discussions, such activities as martial arts and paintballing. During those years, he {{came to the attention of}} MI5, the UK's domestic counter-intelligence and security agency, for radical links and connections with <b>Islamic</b> <b>extremists.</b> To protect his privacy, they did not pass the information along to American officials.|$|E

5|$|From 1990 to 2010, {{there has}} been an {{increase}} in violence in the hitherto largely peaceful city. Following the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, the city was rocked by the Hindu-Muslim riots of 1992–93 in which more than 1,000people were killed. On 12 March 1993, a series of 13 co-ordinated bombings at several city landmarks by <b>Islamic</b> <b>extremists</b> and the Bombay underworld resulted in 257 deaths and over 700 injuries. In 2006, 209 people were killed and over 700 injured when seven bombs exploded on the city's commuter trains. In 2008, a series of ten coordinated attacks by armed terrorists for three days resulted in 173 deaths, 308 injuries, and severe damage to several heritage landmarks and prestigious hotels. The blasts that occurred at the Opera House, Zaveri Bazaar, and Dadar on 13 July 2011 were the latest in the series of terrorist attacks in Mumbai.|$|E
5|$|On July 18, 1998 a Yugoslav Army (VJ) {{border patrol}} ambushed over 200 Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) insurgents and foreign mujahideen {{just west of}} Dečani, on the {{frontier}} between Albania and Yugoslavia. The ambush resulted {{in the deaths of}} four KLA fighters and 18 mujahideen (mostly citizens of Saudi Arabia). Another six KLA fighters were arrested by the Yugoslav authorities and charged with illegal entry and gunrunning. The VJ reported seizing a significant amount of arms and ammunition that the militants had been smuggling. One Yugoslav border guard was seriously wounded in the clash. According to Israeli historian Shaul Shay, the ambush represented the first clash of the Kosovo War between the VJ and foreign mujahideen. Human Rights Watch advisor Fred C. Abrahams suggests {{it is possible that the}} mujahideen were deliberately led into a trap by the KLA as part of a plan to reduce the influence of <b>Islamic</b> <b>extremists</b> within the KLA's ranks.|$|E
5|$|Suharto {{relied on}} the {{military}} to ruthlessly maintain domestic security, organized by the Kopkamtib (Operation Command for the Restoration of Security and Order) and BAKIN (State Intelligence Coordination Agency). To maintain strict control over the country, Suharto expanded the army's territorial system down to village-level, while military officers were appointed as regional heads {{under the rubric of}} the Dwifungsi ("Dual Function") of the military. By 1969, 70% of Indonesia's provincial governors {{and more than half of}} its district chiefs were active military officers. Suharto authorized Operasi Trisula which destroyed PKI-remnants trying to organize a guerilla base in Blitar area in 1968, and ordered several military operations which ended the communist PGRS-Paraku insurgency in West Kalimantan (1967–1972). Attacks on oil workers by the first incarnation of Free Aceh Movement separatists under Hasan di Tiro in 1977 led to dispatch of small special forces detachments who quickly either killed or forced the movement's members to flee abroad. Notably, in March 1981, Suharto authorised a successful special forces mission to end hijacking of a Garuda Indonesia flight by <b>Islamic</b> <b>extremists</b> at Don Muang Airport in Bangkok.|$|E

25|$|On March 3, 2008, the United States {{launched}} an air strike on Dhoble, a Somali town.

The same area was targeted by U.S. bombers one year earlier. A successful air strike occurred on May 1 in Dhusamareb. It killed the leader of Al-Shabab Aden Hashi Eyrow along with another senior commander and several civilians; however, the attack did nothing {{to slow down the}} Insurgency.|$|E

In 2015, {{the city and the}} nation were shocked by two deadly terrorist attacks carried out by <b>Islamic</b> <b>extremists.</b> The population of the city declined steadily from 1921 until 2004, due to a decrease in family size and an exodus of the middle class to the suburbs; but it is increasing slowly once again, as young people and immigrants move into the city.|$|E

25|$|<b>Islamic</b> <b>extremists</b> in Indonesia {{have been}} {{targeted}} by police as terrorists in the country. Police may either capture or kill dissidents. Cases of police corruption with hidden {{bank accounts and}} retaliation against journalists who attempt to uncover these cases have occurred such as in June 2012, when Indonesian magazine Tempo had journalist activists beaten by police. Separately, on August 31, 2013 police officers in Central Sulawesi province fired into {{a crowd of people}} protesting the death of a local man in police custody. Five people were killed and 34 injured. History of violence goes back to the military-backed Suharto regime (1967–1998), from which Suharto seized power during an anti-Communist purge.|$|E
25|$|Sadat {{was seen}} by Shenouda as {{becoming}} increasingly dictatorial following his acclaim {{in the international arena}} for the peace accord with Israel. In September 1981 Sadat rescinded the presidential decree of 1971 recognizing Shenouda as Pope of Alexandria, and Shenouda was banished by Sadat to an ancient desert monastery. However, the Christians of Egypt continued to view Shenouda as their Pope and only leader, and he continued to conduct his duties from his desert monastery: ecclesiastically, Sadat's decision was ineffective. Sadat was assassinated a month later, on 6 October 1981, by <b>Islamic</b> <b>extremists,</b> and in January 1985 Pope Shenouda III was fully reinstated by Sadat's successor, Hosni Mubarak.|$|E
25|$|Prime Minister Sharif {{announced}} that it would open unconditional talks with the Taliban, declaring them stakeholders rather than terrorists.
