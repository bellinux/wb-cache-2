5|$|Adrienne's head {{is split}} open by a {{swinging}} pendulum blade in one death scene, an effect that took several hours to set up. A fake head was created from a model cast of actress Victoria Morsell's head, with pumps installed to pump fake blood into it, and strings attached {{to either side}} {{so it could be}} pulled apart. The crew only had one head model, so they had to keep putting it back together and reusing <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> for each take. After filming was completed, the crew put the head back together and took a picture of Morsell with it.|$|E
5|$|A {{subdivision}} rule takes a tiling of {{the plane}} by polygons and turns it into a new tiling by subdividing each polygon into smaller polygons. It is finite if there are only finitely many ways that every polygon can subdivide. Each way of subdividing a tile is called a tile type. Each tile type is represented by a label (usually a letter). Every tile type subdivides into smaller tile types. Each edge also gets subdivided according to finitely many edge types. Finite subdivision rules can only subdivide tilings that {{are made up of}} polygons labelled by tile types. Such tilings are called subdivision complexes for the subdivision rule. Given any subdivision complex for a subdivision rule, we can subdivide <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again to get a sequence of tilings.|$|E
500|$|Writing for {{the album}} began in 2009, when Lee wrote an electronic-driven song {{different}} from her usual style. She said, [...] "I remember listening to <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over,</b> just obsessing over {{it the way}} I used to obsess over Evanescence music. That was the spark for me – and the spark {{to go in the}} electronic direction and bring some of that into what Evanescence is doing." [...] Unlike the band's two previous albums (primarily written by Lee), every band member contributed to the writing process.|$|E

[...] On Carey's official Facebook page on May 12, 2012, shortly after the release, she wrote, [...] "I spent four years writing this song, only because after I performed in Schenectady, NY, I started hearing this melody and singing <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> to myself as I was taking a bath, looking at the moon.. Four years later, as I was leaving a devastating {{part of my life}} behind, I wrote the second verse, the bridge and the outro." ...|$|E
500|$|The season {{aired on}} Nickelodeon, {{which is owned}} by Viacom, and was {{produced}} by United Plankton Pictures and Nickelodeon. The season's executive producers were series creator Stephen Hillenburg and Paul Tibbitt, who also acted as the series' showrunner. Upon the announcement of Nickelodeon signing the new show The Mighty B! on December 12, 2006, it renewed SpongeBob SquarePants for a sixth season with 26 episodes in order, surpassing the 100-episode mark. Cyma Zarghami, president of Nickelodeon, said [...] "One {{of the great things about}} animation is that you can play <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again, and kids will still watch it [...] With live action they won't." [...] On March 3, 2008, the season premiered with the episode [...] "Krabby Road". It was written by Luke Brookshier, Nate Cash and Eric Shaw, while Alan Smart served as animation director.|$|E
500|$|The {{band has}} made heavy use of guitars since its inception, and pioneered their {{use during the}} band's early days in Germany. Although not a metal fan, Konietzko said his [...] "infatuation with ripping off metal licks" [...] stemmed from his {{experiments}} with E-mu's Emax sampler in late 1986, adding, [...] "What I always hated most about heavy metal was that the best riffs came only once and were never repeated. So the fascination, actually, was to sample a great riff, loop it, and play <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again." [...] While the album Don't Blow Your Top was more sparse in content, due {{to the influence of}} producer Sherwood, it was {{the exception rather than the}} rule. Ministry founder and frontman Al Jourgensen, on tour with the band in 1989, described KMFDM as [...] "a battalion of guitars marching through Europe." ...|$|E

500|$|Completing {{the main}} cast, Patrick Wymark stars as Jason Webb, {{director}} of EUROSEC. Having selected {{him on the}} basis of his performance as John Wilder in the television series The Plane Makers (1963–65) and The Power Game (1965–70), Anderson stated that Wymark's acting impressed him as much as Hendry's, but also that his similar drinking habits resulted in slurred lines on set. During the filming of one scene, Wymark [...] "had to list these explanations... and on take after take he couldn't remember that 'two' followed 'one'. We had to do <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again." [...] Archer and Hearn identify Wymark's portrayal of Webb, a character described as [...] "John Wilder (2069 model)" [...] in publicity material, as the dominant performance of the film. The draft script describes Webb as a former British Minister of Technology, who is now romantically involved with his secretary, Pam Kirby.|$|E
500|$|... "Someday" [...] was {{recorded}} and mixed by Bob Cadway at The Power Station in New York City. In addition {{to be written}} by Carey and Margulies, they also arranged the song with Chris Toland. In addition to producing the track, Wake also carried out additional arrangement with Rich Tancredi. The drum programming was performed by Wake and Joe Franco, while Cadway played the guitars and Tancredi the keyboards. Carey performed all of her own background vocals. Carey later revealed that [...] "Someday" [...] {{was one of her}} favorite songs on the demo and that she would [...] "listen to <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again on the subway after the studio sessions". However, Carey later expressed her disapproval of some of the new elements added during the production of Mariah Carey, such as the replacement of the horns on the demo in favor of an electric guitar.|$|E
500|$|Following the management's {{rejection}} of the track, Stewart and Nash dealt it out to other record labels. It was also given to English singer-songwriter Taio Cruz, who failed to convince his record company to release it. It was then opted by Island Def Jam chairman Antonio [...] "L.A." [...] Reid, a friend of Stewart who established his first studio. By early February 2007, the demo was sent to Reid's right-hand woman, A executive Karen Kwak, who passed it along to Reid with a message confirming that they had found a song suited for Rihanna, who was working on her third studio album, Good Girl Gone Bad, at the time. Reid immediately sent the demo to Rihanna, who was also positive of it: [...] "When the demo first started playing, I was like, This is interesting, this is weird.... But the song kept getting better. I listened to <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over.</b> I said, 'I need this record. I want to record it tomorrow." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{his review}} for The New York Times John Corry faulted the production's source of {{inspiration}}, saying [...] "The problem with 'Ewoks: The Battle for Endor' isn't that it's badly done; on the contrary, it's wonderfully well done. But when <b>it's</b> <b>over</b> <b>it's</b> <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> {{there is no}} residue. Mr. Lucas and his colleagues find their inspiration in their own technology, {{and there should be}} other places to look." ...|$|R
500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over.</b> All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's what a lot of people have told me this record has been for them.|$|E
500|$|At times Kiedis {{has also}} resented singing the song, {{especially}} during instances {{when he felt}} distanced from the song's lyrics. In the past few years, however, Kiedis has experienced a revival in interest: [...] "Although {{there have been times}} when I was over , I've rediscovered it and now I feel close to it and it still has power, and life, and purpose as a song." [...] Frusciante believed that the flexibility of [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] has contributed to its success: [...] "A lot of the time that is one of the ingredients of a hit; you can hear <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> and it will still always mean new things, but you do go through cycles." [...] Flea believes that the reason [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] had a recent revival in relevancy was due to Frusciante's return to the band from 1998 to 2009 after quitting in 1992. Flea believed that it was vital to have the four members who wrote the track together.|$|E
500|$|The title {{sequence}} of SpongeBob {{for the special}} was made exclusively for the series' tenth anniversary. It was animated in stop motion animation, with Cee Lo Green performing the theme. Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh and Chris Finnegan of Screen Novelties animated its opening titles. Finnegan claimed that the crew were [...] "thrill" [...] to do the title sequence because [...] "the original title sequence is so recognizable and everyone seen <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> and it's so great in its own way." [...] Executive producer and the episode's writer Paul Tibbitt said [...] "We don't just want to redraw it , {{we want it to}} be something special and different So we thought we would do it in three dimensions" [...] Nickelodeon animation president Brown Johnson lauded the new title sequence and said it is [...] "SO great!" [...] Some traditional animation on scraps of brown paper are intermixed into the stop motion.|$|E

500|$|The {{recording}} was {{fraught with}} tension between band members, as McCartney annoyed others by insisting on a perfect performance. The track {{was the first}} Lennon was invited to work on following his car accident, but he hated it and declined to do so. According to engineer Geoff Emerick, Lennon said it was [...] "more of Paul's granny music" [...] and left the session. He {{spent the next two}} weeks with Ono and did not return to the studio until the backing track for [...] "Come Together" [...] was laid down on 21 July. Harrison was also tired of the song, adding [...] "we had to play <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again until Paul liked it. It was a real drag". Starr was more sympathetic to the song. [...] "It was granny music", he admitted, [...] "but we needed stuff like that on our album so other people would listen to it". Starr played the anvil sound in the chorus. This track also makes use of Harrison's Moog Synthesizer, played by McCartney.|$|E

2500|$|Henry Molaison, {{formerly}} known as H.M., changed the way people thought of memory. The case was first reported in a paper by William Beecher Scoville and Brenda Milner in 1957. He was a patient who suffered from severe epilepsy attributed to a bicycle accident {{at the age of}} nine. [...] Physicians were unable to control his seizures with drugs, so the neurosurgeon Scoville tried a new approach involving brain surgery. He removed his medial temporal lobe bilaterally by doing a temporal lobectomy. His epilepsy did improve, but Molaison lost the ability to form new long-term memories (anterograde amnesia). He exhibited normal short-term memory ability. If he was given a list of words, he would forget them in about a minute's time. In fact, he would forget that he was even given a list in the first place. Once Molaison stopped thinking about the lists he was unable to recall them again from long term memory. This gave researchers evidence that short-term and long-term memory are in fact two different processes. Even though he forgot about the lists, he was still able to learn things through his implicit memory. The psychologists would ask him to draw something on a piece of paper, but to look at the paper using a mirror. Though he could never remember ever doing that task, he would improve after doing <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again. This showed the psychologists that he was learning and remembering things unconsciously.|$|E
