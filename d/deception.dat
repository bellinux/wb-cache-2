5|$|In his {{comprehensive}} study, Soviet Military <b>Deception</b> in the Second World War, Glantz {{summarized the}} Russian doctrine as involving both active and passive <b>deception</b> and surprise. For the Soviets, <b>deception</b> permeated {{all levels of}} war. And since they thought of war as just an extension of politics by other means, <b>deception</b> could and should be used and constantly considered in politics before a war began, if it was to work effectively.|$|E
5|$|During Clarke's absence, <b>deception</b> {{hierarchy}} in Middle East Command {{had become}} muddled. Colonel Ralph Bagnold {{had taken over}} <b>deception</b> planning, pushing 'A' Force aside. Clarke was sent to El Alamein, where Allied forces were on the retreat, to work on <b>deception</b> plans. Upon his return, Bagnold was sidelined and 'A' Force reinstated as the primary <b>deception</b> department. Throughout 1942 Clarke implemented Operation Cascade, an order of battle <b>deception</b> which added many fictional units to the Allied formations. Cascade was a success; {{by the end of}} the war the enemy accepted most of the formations as real. From 1942 to 1945, Clarke continued to organise <b>deception</b> in North Africa and southern Europe. After the war, he was asked to record the history of 'A' Force. He retired in 1947 and lived the rest of his life in relative obscurity. As well as pursuing a literary career that produced two histories and a thriller, he worked for the Conservative Party and was a director of Securicor. He died in London in 1974.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of his Cairo posting Clarke learned the art of <b>deception</b> by trial and error. From {{mistakes}} during Camilla he learned to focus on what he wanted the enemy to do rather than on what he wanted them to think. From another early operation (K-Shell, the spreading of rumours about a new Allied super-shell which eventually petered out after the media picked up the story), he learned the value of conducting <b>deception</b> only when there was a clear objective, rather than because it was possible. From Bastion he discovered the difficulty of running a large <b>deception</b> on a short timescale. From these lessons Clarke evolved his principles of <b>deception.</b>|$|E

5|$|Operation Graffham was a {{military}} <b>deception</b> employed by the Allies during the Second World War. It formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad strategic <b>deception</b> designed to disguise the imminent Allied invasion of Normandy.

5|$|Series co-creator Ed Boon {{designed}} <b>Deception</b> to be {{an unpredictable}} fighting game, and included new features such as the minigames as surprises. Several parts from Deadly Alliance such as combos and arenas were redesigned to be more realistic {{as well as more}} interactive. <b>Deception</b> has been well received by video game reviewers, who praised the fights and the new features. The Konquest Mode, however, received criticism for poor voice acting. Several publications have called <b>Deception</b> the best fighting game of 2004.|$|E
5|$|The British Middle East Command Camouflage Directorate (also {{known as}} the Camouflage Unit or Camouflage Branch) {{organised}} major <b>deception</b> operations for Middle East Command in the Western Desert Campaign of the Second World War.

The successful <b>deception</b> was praised publicly by Winston Churchill.|$|E

From there it came to have the broader meaning of military <b>deception,</b> widening to include denial and <b>deception.</b>|$|E

40|$|This project {{argues that}} <b>deceptions</b> are worth {{studying}} as creative acts. The resulting discoveries {{are applied to}} discourses within contemporary narrative illustration. Almost all complex <b>deceptions</b> are texts composed of visual and verbal elements. This research is interested in those <b>deceptions</b> that appear in print and particularly those that involve {{the creation of a}} fictional author through a sustained text meant to be considered real by a particular audience. The <b>deceptions</b> concerning this research are not momentary; they exist as specially created artefacts and documents and are sustained over a substantial period of time. These <b>deceptions</b> are not necessarily created by artists or authors, they may be created by any person who utilises a particular methodology: the appropriation and collage of visual and narrative fragments to create the illusion of a seamless whole. The images in these <b>deceptions</b> respond to the Internet and fragmentary, circular or real time narrative in a way that mainstream illustration, as yet, does not. The research methodology is empirical; evidence of the deceptions’ dissemination and repetition is collected. These are the texts; the illustrated fictions analysed by the thesis. The taxonomy organises them according to their aesthetic characteristics, avoiding psychological speculation and focusing on their substance. The concept of ‘fake literature’ within literary theory and the increasing use of strategies amongst artists that question discredited notions of authenticity are also considered. Certain philosophical theories about the nature of language are used to clarify the discussion...|$|R
5|$|<b>Deception</b> {{contributed to}} major Soviet {{victories}} including the Battle of Stalingrad, the Battle of Kursk, and Operation Bagration (in Belarus): in these cases, surprise was achieved despite very large concentrations of force, both in attack and in defence. The doctrine {{has also been}} put into practice in peacetime, with denial and <b>deception</b> operations in {{events such as the}} Cuban Missile Crisis, the Prague Spring, and the annexation of Crimea.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Archibald Wavell called Clarke to Cairo {{and placed}} him in charge of {{strategic}} <b>deception.</b> As a cover, he was employed {{to set up a}} regional organisation for MI9, a British escape and evasion department. The following year Clarke received a war establishment and set up Advanced Headquarters 'A' Force with a small staff to plan <b>deception</b> operations. Once satisfied with the department's structure, he pursued intelligence contacts in Turkey and Spain. In late 1941 Clarke was called to London, where his <b>deception</b> work had come to the attention of Allied high command. Shortly afterward, while in Madrid, he was arrested wearing women's clothing, in circumstances that remain unclear. He was released and after being questioned by the governor of Gibraltar, allowed to return to Cairo.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the actual formation, a phantom 76th Infantry Division was formed for <b>deception.</b> The phantom division {{was part of the}} notional British Fourth Army, to be used for the fictitious Operation Trolleycar. This operation aimed to deceive the Germans into believing that an Allied landing would occur along the northern German coast. While the <b>deception</b> effort was not a complete success, it managed to divert German attention to the northern flank {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|John Bevan {{had asked}} Newman Smith {{to retain the}} threat of a US {{invasion}} force beyond 28 June when the initial <b>deception</b> was supposed to have ended. Agent Rudloff sent messages on 10, 12 and 18 July referring to the Ironside force. In mid-July, the Allies began Operation Ferdinand, a cover <b>deception</b> for Operation Dragoon, the August 1944 invasion of southern France. The Ironside story was considered as an option in support of Ferdinand, but Noel Wild and Ops (B), the SHAEF <b>deception</b> planners were worried about the impact of a theoretical US invasion force on the continuing Fortitude <b>deception.</b> It was decided that a new story would be presented to the Germans, suggesting that the Allies intended to bolster French resistance in the south of the country. The operation went largely unnoticed and German interest in the Bordeaux region dissipated.|$|E
5|$|Operation Graffham formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad {{strategic}} military <b>deception</b> {{intended to}} confuse the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the Normandy landings. One of the key elements of Bodyguard was Operation Fortitude North, which promoted a fictional threat against Norway via wireless traffic and visual <b>deception.</b> Fortitude North played on German, and particularly Adolf Hitler's, belief that Norway was a key objective for the Allies (although they had earlier considered and rejected the option).|$|E

5|$|Operation Ironside was a Second World War {{military}} <b>deception</b> {{undertaken by}} the Allies in 1944. It formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad strategic <b>deception</b> plan instigated by the Allies throughout the year to help cover the June 1944 invasion of Normandy. Ironside supported the overall <b>deception</b> by suggesting to the Germans that the Allies would subsequently land along the Bay of Biscay. It complemented efforts to deceive the Germans into believing that the Allies would also land in southern France at this time (Operation Vendetta). Bordeaux was an important port for the German war effort and had already been a target of commando raids two years earlier. Ironside intended to play on German fears of an invasion in the region, {{with the aim of}} tying down defensive forces following Operation Overlord in June 1944.|$|E
5|$|Operation Royal Flush formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad {{strategic}} military <b>deception</b> {{intended to}} confuse the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the Normandy landings. Royal Flush developed a series of political misdirections in mid-1944 to support other deceptions between June and July. It evolved from Operation Graffham, a political <b>deception</b> aimed at Sweden between February and March 1944.|$|E
5|$|Operation Royal Flush was a {{military}} <b>deception</b> employed by the Allied Nations during the Second World War {{as part of the}} strategic <b>deception</b> Operation Bodyguard. Royal Flush was a political <b>deception</b> which expanded on the efforts of another Bodyguard <b>deception,</b> Operation Graffham, by emphasising the threat to Norway. It also lent support to parts of Operation Zeppelin via subtle diplomatic overtures to Spain and Turkey. The idea was that information from these neutral countries would filter back to the Abwehr (German Intelligence). Planned in April 1944 by Ronald Wingate, Royal Flush was executed throughout June by various Allied ambassadors to the neutral states. During implementation the plan was revised several times to be less extreme in its diplomatic demands. Information from neutral embassies was not well trusted by the Abwehr; as a result, Royal Flush had limited impact on German plans through 1944.|$|E
