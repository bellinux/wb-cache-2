5|$|The Japanese {{animation}} industry traditionally drew every film cel by hand. This is labor-intensive and inefficient; the cels {{are generally}} non-reusable, and errors {{are difficult to}} correct. This method is called the 2D approach due to the conception of the source images in only two dimensions. The use of computers and <b>graphics</b> <b>software</b> introduced computer graphics (CG) into the industry. This reduced waste; animators can reuse digital cels to correct errors and make changes. Increasing computer power spread the use of three-dimensional <b>graphics</b> <b>software</b> to create 3D models and environments, and render them as 2D images. This 3D approach requires more resources to create the 3D models, but production teams can correct errors or remake film sequences much faster than the traditional 2D approach. The 2D-3D hybrid approach in Karas was due to budget and aesthetic concerns. The 2D approach allowed greater artistic details and creativity, and the 3D approach could save resources. Sato, however, disapproved the common notion of using the 3D approach for economic concern. He pushed the team to enhance image quality with detailed CG. He was also dissatisfied with computer lighting effects, and ordered the animators to draw them by hand. Due to the bright colors of the original cels, they darkened the images and concentrated on areas where shadows should be, leaving untouched the areas where light falls on.|$|E
5|$|After {{creating}} custom plugins for the 3D computer <b>graphics</b> <b>software,</b> Burrows {{claimed that}} the team could create and test entire race tracks within five minutes. The custom plugin used for creating tracks consisted of a 450 kilobyte file, which contained polygon subdividing and data on artificial intelligence, effectively cutting down the time to create tracks from six hours to five minutes. In order to the play the game as soon as possible, the team developed the user interface in the XML markup language, which allowed revisions {{to be made for}} the content at any time. However, Burrows recalled that the only downside to converting everything to XML was that the game was always in danger of becoming too large for the PlayStation Portable's Universal Media Disc. The game's cover art was designed by Popgun, who also designed the logos for games released by EA Sports.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, Gerry Anderson {{supervised}} {{the production of}} a short computer-animated test film, Captain Scarlet and the Return of the Mysterons, to explore the possibility of updating a number of his 1960s Supermarionation series for a 21st-century audience. The working title was Captain Scarlet – The New Millennium. Produced in London by the Moving Picture Company, the film features Francis Matthews and Ed Bishop reprising the roles of Captains Scarlet and Blue. Made using a combination of Maya 3D computer <b>graphics</b> <b>software</b> and motion-capture technology, the plot commences a few years after the Mysterons end their hostilities against Earth, but the reappearance of Captain Black sets the stage for a revival of the war with Mars. Although the film has yet to receive a home video release, it was publicly screened at a Fanderson convention in 2000 and at a science lecture in 2001.|$|E

Despite brief {{plans to keep}} it in-house to sell it along with Fontographer and Virtuoso, Altsys reached {{an agreement with the}} multimedia software company, Macromedia, to be acquired. This mutual agreement provided FreeHand and Fontographer a new home with ample resources for marketing, sales, and competition against the newly merged Adobe-Aldus company. Altsys would remain in Richardson, Texas, but would be renamed as the Digital Arts Group of Macromedia and was responsible for the continued development of FreeHand. Macromedia received FreeHand’s 200,000 customers and expanded its traditional product line of multimedia <b>graphics</b> <b>software</b> to illustration and design <b>graphics</b> <b>software.</b> CEO James Von Ehr became a Macromedia vice-president until 1997 when he left to start another venture.|$|E
25|$|A {{large form}} of digital art, pixel art is created {{through the use}} of raster <b>graphics</b> <b>software,</b> where images are edited on the pixel level.

25|$|The script {{called for}} an entirely new {{location}} on the Enterprise, stellar cartography. According to Zimmerman, the script characterized the location as a small room with maps on one wall. Finding the concept uninteresting, Zimmerman designed a circular set with three stories {{to give the impression}} the actors are inside a star map. Zimmerman's previous work designing a crisis management center influenced the design, dominated by video screens. Before the rise of large-format inkjet printers and computer <b>graphics</b> <b>software</b> in the few years before the film was made, the backlit starmaps that covered three-quarters of the wall would have been infeasible to create.

25|$|Virtual {{entities}} {{may contain}} and {{be controlled by}} assorted attributes, such as transform values (location, orientation, and scale) stored in an object's transformation matrix. Animation is the change of an attribute over time. Multiple methods of achieving animation exist; the rudimentary form {{is based on the}} creation and editing of keyframes, each storing a value at a given time, per attribute to be animated. The 2D/3D <b>graphics</b> <b>software</b> will change with each keyframe, creating an editable curve of a value mapped over time, in which results in animation. Other methods of animation include procedural and expression-based techniques: the former consolidates related elements of animated entities into sets of attributes, useful for creating particle effects and crowd simulations; the latter allows an evaluated result returned from a user-defined logical expression, coupled with mathematics, to automate animation in a predictable way (convenient for controlling bone behavior beyond what a hierarchy offers in skeletal system set up).|$|E
25|$|Counterfeiting is {{measured}} using a system borrowed from chemistry known as {{parts per million}} (PPM). Normally used to judge the potency of molecules in a solution, PPM in the counterfeit sense refers {{to the number of}} fake banknotes found in circulation for every one million genuine notes. In 1990, Canada's counterfeit ratio was just 4 PPM, ranking its currency among the most secure in the world. By the late 1990s, the rise of powerful and affordable home computers, store-bought <b>graphics</b> <b>software,</b> easy-to-use scanners and colour ink-jet printers were breeding a new generation of counterfeiters. The number of fake Canadian bills rose as high as 117 PPM by 1997. In 2004 Canada’s counterfeit rate had ballooned to 470 PPM. In 2012, the counterfeiting rate had fallen to its lowest point, at 28 PPM. It has since started modestly rising to 36 PPM in 2014. The Bank of Canada's MTP (Medium Term Plan) target to stay below is 30 PPM. Most G20 nations used 50 PPM as their benchmark to stay below.|$|E
25|$|Newspapers {{are usually}} printed on cheap, off-white paper known as newsprint. Since the 1980s, the {{newspaper}} industry has largely {{moved away from}} lower-quality letterpress printing to higher-quality, four-color process, offset printing. In addition, desktop computers, word processing software, <b>graphics</b> <b>software,</b> digital cameras and digital prepress and typesetting technologies have revolutionized the newspaper production process. These technologies have enabled newspapers to publish color photographs and graphics, as well as innovative layouts and better design. To help their titles stand out on newsstands, some newspapers are printed on coloured newsprint. For example, the Financial Times is printed on a distinctive salmon pink paper, and Sheffield's weekly sports publication derives its name, the Green 'Un, from the traditional colour of its paper. The Italian sports newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport is also printed on pink paper while L'Équipe (formerly L'Auto) is printed on yellow paper. Both the latter promoted major cycling races and their newsprint colours were reflected in the colours of the jerseys used to denote the race leader; for example the leader in the Giro d'Italia wears a pink jersey.|$|E

25|$|Texture mapping is {{a method}} for adding detail, surface texture, or colour to a computer-generated graphic or 3D model. Its {{application}} to 3D graphics was pioneered by Dr Edwin Catmull in 1974. A texture map is applied (mapped) {{to the surface of}} a shape, or polygon. This process is akin to applying patterned paper to a plain white box. Multitexturing is the use of more than one texture at a time on a polygon. Procedural textures (created from adjusting parameters of an underlying algorithm that produces an output texture), and bitmap textures (created in an image editing application or imported from a digital camera) are, generally speaking, common methods of implementing texture definition on 3D models in computer <b>graphics</b> <b>software,</b> while intended placement of textures onto a model's surface often requires a technique known as UV mapping (arbitrary, manual layout of texture coordinates) for polygon surfaces, while non-uniform rational B-spline (NURB) surfaces have their own intrinsic parameterization used as texture coordinates. Texture mapping as a discipline also encompasses techniques for creating normal maps and bump maps that correspond to a texture to simulate height and specular maps to help simulate shine and light reflections, as well as environment mapping to simulate mirror-like reflectivity, also called gloss.|$|E
