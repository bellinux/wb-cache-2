When forest fires break out more frequently next to homes and urban settlements, and become increasingly more dangerous, this constitutes a worrying and important topic, not only in Portugal, but in all Mediterranean countries. The present study consists of mapping, the regulations defined by Decree n. 17 / 2009, from January 14 th, to a map, with detailed representation of secondary networks for fuel-breaks (fuel build-up control) in two contrasting landscapes. The goals of this study were: (i) <b>to</b> <b>transpose</b> the <b>legislation</b> into cartography; (ii) to estimate costs of the creation of the secondary network, based on a very simple assumption of the type of operation to be carried out, (iii) to identify local and regional differences and (iv) to identify local and regional differences and (iv) to compare our mapping with that performed under a Municipal Plan For Forest Protection Against Wildfires. The development of the study took place in two areas, located to the North and Center of Portugal. The results show that the legislation is sufficiently clear to allow for the representation, on a map, of secondary network lanes, in all their representations. They also show that the dimensions of the secondary network, the estimate of costs for the creation of said secondary network and the interventional priority differ, according to the type and landscap...|$|R
40|$|Given the {{increasing}} incidence of serious flooding in Europe {{in recent years}} it might seem odd to be addressing the problem of water conservation. However, recent economic prosperity {{has led to an}} increased per capita use of water for domestic and industrial use. The traditional approach to meeting increased demand is to augment supply. However, mobilising new resources involves ever higher costs. Allied to this is the concept of sustainability, which can be defined as ‘development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs’. An important consideration of itself, sustainability forms {{a major part of the}} new EU water strategy outlined in the Water Framework Directive 2000, which member states have 3 years <b>to</b> <b>transpose</b> into national <b>legislation.</b> Therefore, the concept of water conservation and water saving technologies are set to play a major role in our lives. Increasing the rate of water efficiency requires a multi-dimensional approach that can be achieved by adopting alternative technologies.

40|$|ABSTRACT: High {{levels of}} WEEE and limited {{capacities}} for disposal and recycling, {{together with the}} necessity <b>to</b> <b>transpose</b> the European <b>legislation</b> into national law have shaped the profile of WEEE system in Romania. In order to improve the functionality of this system {{it is important to}} understand the citizens’ behaviour towards WEEE recycling. Recent research conducted in different countries suggest that various determinants, such as socio-economic and demographic factors, environmental knowledge, habits, conve-nience, motivations, can be used to analyse WEEE recycling behaviour. The results are contradictory and demonstrate that the peculiarities of each country have different influences on how people engage in WEEE collection and recycling. In the present paper, using hypotheses testing we have developed a WEEE recycling behaviour model for Romanians. It was assumed that socio-demographic factors and personal norms would predict WEEE recycling attitude and attitude, contextual forces, knowledge and recycling habits would influ-ence WEEE recycling behaviour. The data, gathered using a survey, were processed using a fuzzy approach. The results showed that in the Romanian context the strongest determinants of WEEE recycling behaviour are people attitudes and habits. Moderate effects have recycling knowledge, pro-environmental norms and insti-tutional support, while gender, income, perception of availability of collection points and regulations haven’t any influence...|$|R

40|$|The Time-Limit Prescription: A Difficult Dialogue {{between the}} Court of Justice of the European Union and the National Judge This article aims to {{underline}} the uncertainties and ambiguities surrounding {{the application of}} European Court’s case law principles into the national legal system. More specifically, {{the issue of the}} time-limits for bringing an action based on EC/ EU law in a domestic court is an emblematic example of how different could be the judicial protection of individual rights in the Member States, and how difficult could be “to transfer” the addresses marked by the Court of Justice in national codes. 71 Cass., sez. lavoro, sentenza dell’ 8 febbraio 2012, n. 1850. Il difficile dialogo in tema di decorrenza del termine di prescrizione 83 In its first part the article points out the efforts of the ECJ in balancing the rules of national procedural laws (the so called principle of procedural autonomy of Member States) with the effectiveness of European Union law. Therefore it illustrates the origin and evolution of case law on time limit prescription starting from the Emmott case up to Danske Slagterier. In the second part the article deals with the national limitation periods applicable to claims based on Directives not fully implemented before the Italian courts: the case that led to a paradigm of uncertainty of interpretations (on the issue of the limitation period) of EU law is related to the Italian medical trainees. The main problem has been the exact classification of the legal basis of the State’s responsibility for late or non-faithful transposition of the Directive referred to medical trainees: at the beginning the Italian Supreme Court 7630 / 2003 addressed the responsibility under Article 2043 of the Italian civil code (with the consequent application of the limitation period of five years for claims). Then starting from the judgment of Cassazione 9147 / 2009, up to the most recent decisions Cassazione 17350 / 2011, and Cassazione 10813 / 2011 the State’s responsibility (for late or non-faithful transposition of the Directive) has been described as contractual liability (with the consequent application for claims of the limitation period of ten years). Finally it is remarked that all the efforts of the Italian courts to achieve a reasonable balance with the rulings of ECJ have been wiped out by law no. 183 / 2011 (the so-called Law of Stability, of November 12, 2011) : under Article 43 it is stated that “the prescription of the right to compensation for damage caused by <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>transpose</b> into the State the Directives or other binding European measures follows the rules laid down in Article 2947 of the Civil Code” (it means the application for claims of a limitation period of five years).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to make a {{retrospective}} analysis of the legal framework in the field of veterinary and sanitary control of raw milk and dairy products for the period 1947 - 2013. The reasons leading to the transformation of animal health legislation in the control of raw milk and dairy products in four periods of socio-economic development of Bulgaria are briefly discussed. These are the period of central planning - 1947 - 1989, the period of transition to a market economy - 1990 - 2000, pre-accession period 2000 - 2007 and the period of membership – after 2007. In operational order an analysis of the acting laws and regulatory documents during these periods is made, as well as their impact on official controls of raw milk and dairy products. Detailed description of the negotiation process in the field of veterinary issues and in particular the harmonization of Bulgarian legislation with the EU commitments is made and its application done by the competent authorities, milk producers and processors. In addition, the role of NVS in the regulatory transposition process and implementation of the newly <b>transposed</b> <b>legislation</b> and the restructuring of the Bulgarian dairy business in implementing the requirements of the <b>transposed</b> <b>legislation</b> in the dairy sector is described...|$|R

It {{is to be expected}} that it will occur even more often due to increased migration to towns, urbanisation, construction and industrialization around bigger town areas. This problem is stressed in bigger towns along the Adriatic coast. In the summer months, due to big number of tourists, environmental impacts multiply, while the existing infrastructure (waste management centres, waste water treatment plans, water supply, noise and traffic infrastructure) minimally meet the increasing needs. Apart from the inadequate infrastructure, the EU environmental directives have not been fully <b>transposed</b> <b>to</b> Croatian <b>legislation.</b> However {{in the last two years}} significant changes have been made especially with regard to waste and waste waters. The level of institutional capacity for environmental management in urban areas is inadequate, especially with regard to the knowledge and experience in strategic planning and environmental management, as well as in public participation in the decision-making on environment.
