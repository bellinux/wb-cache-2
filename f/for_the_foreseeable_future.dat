5|$|At {{the same}} time, {{there would be}} a {{continuing}} need for fast freight locomotives, capable of operating on both electrified and non-electrified routes, without impeding the intensive use of the system by passenger trains. Suburban electrification used electric multiple units, which had no equivalent freight design.

5|$|Britannia {{submitted}} {{an application}} {{to turn the}} fire station into a 227-bed 4-star hotel in June 2010. The Victorian Society praised the proposed conversion. Manchester City Council decided {{to continue with the}} CPO. The city council issued a CPO on 5 August 2010. Despite the plans being approved 16 September 2010, the council continued to pursue a CPO and solicited bids for a development partner in January 2011. Britannia's objection to the CPO led to a public inquiry in April 2011. On 29 November 2011, the Department for Communities and Local Government confirmed the CPO had been rejected. Despite Britannia's guarantee at the inquiry to proceed with the development it reconsidered its plans. In a letter to English Heritage, Britannia said the proposed scheme was unsustainable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreseeable</b> <b>future.</b> Britannia wanted to return to the rejected tower plan. English Heritage and the city council expressed disappointment. The city council offered to buy the building at market value.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea's biggest winning {{scoreline}} in {{a competitive}} match is 13–0, achieved against Jeunesse Hautcharage in the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971. The club's biggest top-flight win was an 8–0 victory against Wigan Athletic in 2010, which was matched in 2012 against Aston Villa. Chelsea's biggest loss was an 8–1 reverse against Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1953. Officially, Chelsea's highest home attendance is 82,905 for a First Division match against Arsenal on 12 October 1935. However, an estimated crowd of over 100,000 attended a friendly match against Soviet team Dynamo Moscow on 13 November 1945. The modernisation of Stamford Bridge during the 1990s {{and the introduction of}} all-seater stands mean that neither record will be broken <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreseeable</b> <b>future.</b> The current legal capacity of Stamford Bridge is 41,663.

5|$|Despite {{the firm}} {{intention}} of Sandy Pearlman and Albert Bouchard {{to salvage the}} project, the recordings remained unfinished and untouched {{for more than two}} years due to lack of funding. While struggling with the long, complex and expensive production of the Blue Öyster Cult's album Club Ninja, Pearlman associated himself with Daniel J. Levitin, A director of the local punk label 415 Records, with whom shared academic interests in neuroscience. In 1986, Pearlman leased Studio C of San Francisco's Hyde Street Recording Studios, and dubbed it Alpha & Omega Studios. Pearlman and Levitin produced various bands there, and Pearlman sub-leased the studio to other producers. In September 1986, when the poor sales of Club Ninja resulted in a commercial failure and the group disbanded, the lack of new material from the band <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreseeable</b> <b>future</b> prompted Pearlman to propose Imaginos to Columbia Records as a new Blue Öyster Cult album. He obtained a small budget from the record label to remix the album and to add the vocals of Roeser and Bloom, singers of all the hits produced by Blue Öyster Cult.|$|E
5|$|During development, id {{approached}} Sierra Entertainment, {{then one}} of the biggest companies in the industry and employer of several of their idols, with the goal of seeing if they could make a deal with the company. After viewing Commander Keen and an early version of Wolfenstein 3D, CEO Ken Williams offered to buy id Software for US$2.5 million and turn it into an in-house development studio. The team was excited by the deal, but had felt there was a large culture clash between the two companies during their visit to Sierra and were hesitant to accept; Romero proposed asking for US$100,000 in cash up front {{as part of the deal}} rather than solely accepting payment in Sierra stock as a measure of Williams's seriousness. Williams refused, which id interpreted to mean that Williams did not truly recognize the potential of Wolfenstein 3D and the company, and the deal fell through, causing id to decide to remain an independent company <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreseeable</b> <b>future.</b> By the end of 1993 just before the release of their next game, Doom, the success of Wolfenstein 3D led id to receive multiple calls every month from investment companies looking to make id a publicly-traded company, which were all turned down.|$|E

With the king dead, Mjaan, the most senior of the izinDuna, took command of the Matabele. Mjaan was an old man, and his only son had been killed in the war. He wished to make peace. In late February 1894, he convened an indaba at which he and his contemporaries met with James Dawson, a trader known to them for many years, who offered the olive branch on behalf of the Company. The izinDuna unanimously accepted. They also told the trader what had happened to the Shangani Patrol, and led him to the battle site to survey it, as well as to examine and identify the largely skeletonised bodies of the soldiers, which still lay where they had fallen. Dawson was the first non-Matabele to learn of the last stand.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{mechanisms for}} markets that are double-sided and have players with multi-dimensional strategic spaces {{on at least}} one side. The players of the market are strategic, and act to optimize their own utilities. The mechanism designer, on the other hand, aims to optimize a social goal, i. e., the gain from trade. We focus on one example of this setting which is motivated by <b>the</b> <b>foreseeable</b> <b>future</b> form of online advertising. Online advertising currently supports {{some of the most important}} Internet services, including: search, social media and user generated content sites. To overcome privacy concerns, it has been suggested to introduce user information markets through information brokers into the online advertising ecosystem. Such markets give users control over which data get shared in the online advertising exchange. We describe a model <b>for</b> <b>the</b> above <b>foreseeable</b> <b>future</b> form of online advertising, and design two mechanisms <b>for</b> <b>the</b> exchange of this model: a deterministic mechanism which is related to the vast literature on mechanism design through trade reduction and allows players with a multi-dimensional strategic space, and a randomized mechanism which can handle a more general version of the model.

5|$|In this situation, {{the court}} had decided in {{previous}} cases that immigration detention, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> purposes of processing and removal, did not infringe on Chapter III. Al-Kateb argued that if indeed {{the provisions of the}} Migration Act extended as far as to allow the indefinite detention of people like him, then it would have gone beyond those valid purposes and would infringe Chapter III. That is, non-judicial detention is permitted <b>for</b> <b>the</b> purposes of facilitating the removal of unlawful non-citizens, and if the prospects of removal are remote or impracticable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> reasonably <b>foreseeable</b> <b>future,</b> then <b>the</b> detention can no longer be considered to be <b>for</b> <b>the</b> purpose of removal. Al-Kateb's argument in this respect relied on a decision of the Federal Court in another case, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Al Masri, in which a Full Court of the Federal Court found that a person in a very similar situation to Al-Kateb was entitled to be released.|$|R
