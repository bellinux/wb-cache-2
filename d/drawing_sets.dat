50|$|Design Web Format (DWF) is {{a secure}} file format {{developed}} by Autodesk for the efficient distribution and communication of rich design data {{to anyone who}} needs to view, review, or print design files. Because DWF files are highly compressed, they are smaller and faster to transmit than design files, without the overhead associated with complex CAD drawings (or the management of external links and dependencies). With DWF functionality, publishers of design data can limit the specific design data and plot styles to only what they want recipients to see and can publish multisheet <b>drawing</b> <b>sets</b> from multiple AutoCAD drawings in a single DWF file. They can also publish 3D models from most Autodesk design applications.|$|E

40|$|Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), several {{crashworthy}} wood {{bridge railings}} and approach railing transitions have been adapted {{for use on}} concrete bridge decks. These railings meet testing and evaluation criteria outlined in National Cooperative Research Program (NCHRP) Report 350, Recommended Procedures for the Safety Performance Evaluation of Highway Features, and include a glued-laminated timber (glulam) rail, with and without a curb, at Test Level- 2 (TL- 2), a glulam rail with curb at TL- 4, and a glulam curb rail for low-volume roads at TL- 1. In adapting the railings from a wood deck to a concrete deck, the critical consideration was railing attachment to the deck. A comparable connection was obtained by an analysis of maximum loads measured by field instrumentation during crash testing or by equating the ultimate capacity of connections used on the wood deck to those required for a concrete deck.

40|$|This {{collection}} {{consists of}} drawings, specifications, reference material, a report, postcards, and scrapbook {{material from the}} office of Richard E. Bishop, Indianapolis architect. It covers the period 1924 - 1969. The drawings are mostly designs for park and recreational facilities. Several sets are for inns and lodges at Indiana state parks. Several children’s camps are represented, too. Other <b>drawing</b> <b>sets</b> are for private residences, a fraternity house, and additions and alterations to Indianapolis Public School 56. Most of the work is by Bishop but a few projects are by other architectural firms: Lennox & Matthews, August C. Bohlen, and Allen &` Kelley. The drawings are arranged chronologically. Specifications for the Public School 56 projects, written in 1961 and 1962, are also included. One binder of reference material consists of plans and renderings for modest-size houses designed by the Architectural Guild of Indianapolis, ca. 1933. Another binder contains letter-size blueprints showing “standard construction details” for recreational and other conservation areas issued by the Indiana Department of Conservation in 1943 and 1944 (with one sheet dated 1955). Five document cases contain additional reference materials—magazine clippings and pamphlets about architecture collected by Bishop for office use. These are grouped according to building type or subject. Seven document cases hold scrapbooks of newspaper clippings dating from 1958 to 1961. The clippings are arranged chronologically...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Due to {{the recent}} {{interest}} in hands-only protocols for dispatcher-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) {{and the lack of}} any validated algorithms in French, our primary objective was to evaluate a new French-language protocol in terms of its efficacy to help previously untrained volunteers in performing basic life support efforts of appropriate quality, and secondarily to investigate its potential utility in subjects with previous training. METHODS: Untrained volunteers were recruited among adults in a public movie centre and previously trained volunteers among undergraduate nursing students. Participants were randomly assigned to 'phone CPR' versus 'no phone CPR' by <b>drawing</b> <b>sets</b> of envelopes. Primary outcome measures were the results of the Cardiff evaluation test; the secondary measures were global scoring of a complete 5 min period of CPR, in a manikin model of cardiac arrest. RESULTS: Out of 146 volunteers assessed for eligibility, 36 previously untrained candidates declined participation. 110 participants, distributed into four groups, completed the study: the previously untrained non-guided group (group A, n= 30), the previously untrained guided group (group B, n= 30), the previously trained non-guided group (group C, n= 25) and the previously trained guided group (group D, n= 25). Results of the Cardiff test and global evaluation of CPR performance revealed a significant improvement in group B as compared with group A, approaching the level of the group C. Previously trained guided bystanders had the best CPR scores, notably because of an improvement in the quality of airway management. CONCLUSION: When used by dispatchers, this new French-language algorithm offers the opportunity to help previously untrained bystanders initiate CPR. The same protocol may serve to guide volunteers with prior basic life support training to reach their best CPR performance. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Pacer Comet 4 {{found its}} {{life out of}} {{necessity}} to replace an obsolescent Pacer Comet 3 engine test system at Tinker AFB in Oklahoma City, OK. Pacer Comet 3 (PC 3) was created and installed in the early 19802 ̆ 7 s to test jet engines {{from a wide range}} of planes. PC 3 had several problems from a maintenance standpoint: contractors designed and installed the system but the contract did not include the OEM data package. Without drawings or design knowledge, fixing the smallest of problems could turn into a multi‐day project. In addition to high cost, as the OEM companies of proprietary parts went out of business, it became impossible to find a replacement for a failed part. These issues set the framework for the Pacer Comet 4 (PC 4) system. PC 4 was created as an organic AF and Department of Defense collaboration to fix the issues with PC 3. PC 4 provides the customer with a complete data package including multiple <b>drawing</b> <b>sets</b> and data sheets for all parts used, as well as design files for all PCBs created in house. PC 4 has a standard to use commercially available off the shelf parts (COTS). The reason for this is sustainability in maintenance. If a part is to fail, it should be able to be purchased from any man-ufacturer that meets the specs of the original product. No proprietary parts are used, except as directed by the engine 2 ̆ 7 s OEM. This thesis will focus on the design and installation of the on-frame data acquisition PC 4 system for the Pratt 2 ̆ 6 Whitney TF 33 ‐P 100 A‐QEC engine that is currently in use on the E 3 Sentry. This thesis will show efficiency improvements for maintenance sustainability (70...|$|E
