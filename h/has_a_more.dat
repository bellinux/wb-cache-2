5|$|Cyathus helenae is {{distinguished}} from the more common C.striatus by its faint inner-surface plication (C.striatus <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> pronounced plication), the nodular arrangement of the hairs on the outer surface, and microscopically by the spore shape – ellipsoid in C.striatus, ovoid or spheroidal in C.helenae.|$|E

Like Holmes, Grissom is dispassionate with a fierce devotion to logic and {{little regard for}} societal norms of behavior; Grissom once smashed mustard jars {{in a grocery store}} to illustrate a theory ("I-15 Murders"), much as Holmes once practiced spearing a pig in a butchers to determine how strong a man would have to be to transfix a man with a harpoon.|$|E
5|$|Guzmán {{considers}} Psilocybe tampanensis to be intermediate in form between P.mexicana and P.caerulescens. Psilocybe mexicana <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> Mycena-like {{fruit body}} shape, and longer basidia measuring 22–24 by 7.7–11μm. It is known only from Mexico and Guatemala. Psilocybe caerulescens, {{found in the}} USA and Venezuela, is also somewhat similar, but has a collybioid habit (small to medium-sized mushrooms with a convex cap), with spores measuring 6.7–8 by 5.2–6.5 by 3.3–5.2μm, and cheilocystidia that are 15–22 by 4.4–5.5μm.|$|E
5|$|In Iberia, {{the western}} Mediterranean and {{northwest}} Africa, the common starling may {{be confused with}} the closely related spotless starling, the plumage of which, as its name implies, <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> uniform colour.

5|$|In western Madagascar, {{sympatric}} ring-tailed lemurs and red-fronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons) {{have been}} studied together. Little interaction takes place between the two species. While the diets of the two species overlap, they eat in different proportions since the ring-tailed lemur <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> varied diet and spends {{more time on the}} ground.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius {{is mainly}} {{known from the}} north {{temperate}} zone, but some species also occur in tropical Asia and Africa. Lactifluus <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> tropical distribution than Lactarius, with most species known from tropical Africa, Asia, South America, and Australasia, but some also occurring in the north temperate zone. Multifurca is the rarest among the four mushroom genera, known only from some punctual records in North and Central America, Asia, and Australasia.|$|E
5|$|Leccinellum albellum {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to L.holopus, but grows in association with oak and <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> southerly distribution.

5|$|M. l. edouardi, like M. l. leucopterus, have {{black-and-white}} coloured males, and {{are found}} only on Barrow Island, also off the western coast of Australia. Birds of this subspecies {{are larger than}} those of M. l. leucopterus but have a shorter tail. The female <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> cinnamon tinge to her plumage than the grey-brown {{of the other two}} subspecies. It was described by A.J. Campbell in 1901.|$|E
5|$|On October 6, 2015, Little, Brown and Company {{released}} the , {{which includes a}} nearly-400 page reimagining of the novel with Edward and Bella gender-swapped as Edythe and Beau.

5|$|Pseudoplectania sphagnophila resembles P.nigrella, but <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> {{deeply and}} {{persistently}} cup-shaped fruit body, a short but distinct stem, and only grows amongst sphagnum moss.

5|$|Roridula <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> complex {{relationship}} with its prey. The plants in this genus produce sticky leaves with resin-tipped glands that look {{similar to those}} of larger Drosera. However, the resin, unlike mucilage, is unable to carry digestive enzymes. Therefore, Roridula species do not directly benefit from the insects they catch. Instead, they form a mutualistic symbiosis with species of assassin bugs that eat the trapped insects. The plant benefits from the nutrients in the bugs' feces.|$|E
5|$|The bird's plumage {{colouration}} is most {{similar to}} the pale-bellied tapaculo. The S. g. morenoi subspecies of the pale-bellied tapaculo can be differentiated from the Perijá tapaculo by its entirely brown back and nape, and its different calls. Juveniles of this subspecies have a dull ventral plumage, while the Perijá tapaculo <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> yellow plumage. It also resembles the Caracas tapaculo but has a duller ventral colour.|$|E
5|$|The {{three main}} {{characters}} of the novella, Selver, Lyubov, and Davidson, have been described by reviewers as representing three different historical attitudes towards nature. Davidson represent the machismo of some early explorers, who feared nature and wanted to overcome it. Lyubov <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> positive but highly romanticized view of the forest, while only Selver and the other Athsheans are able to live in harmony with it.|$|E

Kevin J. Coyne of Country Universe gave the song a B rating, also saying that it <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> traditional production.|$|R

Similar pilot viewing angles as the 767 result from a downward sloped cockpit floor and the same forward cockpit windows.|$|E
5|$|A {{resident}} of Tiruchirappalli is generally {{referred to as}} a Tiruchiite. Situated {{at the edge of the}} Kaveri Delta, the culture of Tiruchirappalli is predominantly , prevalent elsewhere in the delta. With a substantial population of students and migrant industrial workers from different parts of India, Tiruchirappalli <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> cosmopolitan outlook than the surrounding countryside. The main festival celebrated in Tiruchirappalli is Pongal, a regional harvest festival celebrated during January. As part of the Pongal celebrations, Jallikattu, a bull-taming village sport played on the last day of the festival, is occasionally held on the outskirts of the city. Aadi Perukku, Samayapuram flower festival, Vaikunta Ekadasi, Srirangam car festival, and the Teppakulam float festival are some of the prominent festivals that are held locally. Bakrid and Eid al-Fitr are also widely celebrated, owing to the substantial number of Muslims in the city. Nationwide festivals such as the Gregorian New Year, Christmas, Deepavali and Holi are also celebrated in Tiruchirappalli.|$|E
5|$|Also {{found on}} {{calcareous}} (chalky) soils, Rubroboletus satanas is larger {{and has a}} pale cap, and its upper stem lacks the reticulations characteristic of S.luridus. Its flesh does not turn blue so markedly on bruising or cutting. It <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> globular overall shape, and young mushrooms carry a smell of decay. The edible Neoboletus luridiformis can be distinguished from S.luridus by its dark brown cap; it also grows on sandy soils associated with conifers. In North America, it can {{be confused with the}} poisonous Rubroboletus pulcherrimus, which has a fatter stalk and deeper red pores. Initially collected in Michigan under oak, Boletus vinaceobasis resembles S.luridus but has shorter spores and its cystidia are dark brown in Melzer's reagent. Boletus species that share a similar appearance with S.luridus but lack reticulation in their stems include B.subvelutipes (found in North America and Asia) and B.hypocarycinus (United States).|$|E
