40|$|From the {{perspective}} of surface bonding, {{the origin of the}} O-reduced <b>inner</b> potential and <b>work</b> <b>function</b> in very LEED (VLEED - very low energy electron diffraction) is analysed. It is recognised that, for the O-Cu(001) sample, such a reduction originates from the O-metal bonding, namely, variations of atomic states. The inner potential relates to the charge quantity and the <b>work</b> <b>function</b> depends on the density-of-state of the surface. With expansion in size and elevation in energy-state, the metal dipoles induced by the hybridised-O- 2 are responsible for the reduction in the local <b>work</b> <b>function.</b> Therefore, the <b>inner</b> potential and the <b>work</b> <b>function</b> act as important identities for the surface electrons. It is suggested that, at very low energies, the exchange-interaction between the energetic incident beams and the surface is insignificant, and hence the energy-reduced inner potential is weak enough to be neglected. The VLEED is therefore an ideal tool for nondestructive information about the behaviour of surface electrons...|$|R

Adsorption of PTCDA leads to pinning of the <b>work</b> <b>function</b> {{for a range of}} metal substrates. It gives interface dipoles that compensate for the difference in the clean metal <b>work</b> <b>functions,</b> leading to a nearly constant <b>work</b> <b>function.</b> In contrast, adsorption of benzene always results in a decrease of the <b>work</b> <b>function,</b> which is relatively constant for all metal substrates.
