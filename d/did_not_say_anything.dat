5|$|In Salinas, Genevevo Salinas of Houston had voluntarily gone to {{a police}} station when {{officers}} asked him to accompany them {{to talk about the}} murder of two men. Salinas answered most of the officers' questions, but simply remained silent when they asked him whether shotgun casings found {{at the scene of the}} murders would match his gun. He shifted his feet, and otherwise acted nervously, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything.</b> Later, at his trial, prosecutors told jurors that his silence in the face of that question showed that he was guilty, that he knew that the shotgun used to kill the victims was his. Salinas' lawyer wanted the Supreme Court to rule that the simple fact of silence during police questioning, when an individual was not under arrest, could not be used against that person at a criminal trial.|$|E
25|$|According to Greek {{accounts}} Xandrammes was deposed by Sandrokottos, son of Sandrokottos. Chandragupta Maurya {{had opposed}} Dhanananda of the Nanda dynasty; {{his son was}} Bindusara. These names (Dhanananda and Bindusara) are dissimilar to the names Xandrammes and Sandrocyptus in the Greek accounts. However, {{as in the case}} of Amitraghata (Bindusara), Greek sources mention secondary (Sanskritic) names for Indian kings. The Greek accounts contain statements from Greek and Roman writers from the fourth century BC to the second century CE. None mention Kautilya or Ashoka. Kautilya, according to tradition, helped Chandragupta to the throne. Ashoka's empire was larger than Chandragupta's. Colebrook has pointed out that the Greek writers <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about the Buddhist Bhikkhus (although that was the predominant religion of the time) due to Ashoka's patronage. Herodotos, in his Histories, about 420 BC, mentions ascetics in the Punjab.|$|E

The agency-invented term traditional cultural property (TCP) is commonly used {{as a substitute for}} the actual terminology in the 1992 amendment, but it has also been appropriated for places that have nothing whatsoever to do with Native Americans or Native Hawaiians. Like the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, and many other laws and Executive Orders that have been enacted to protect Native American rights specifically, the 1992 {{amendment to}} the National Historic Preservation Act was passed expressly on behalf of Native American Tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations, and that is its only legally recognized purpose.

Milhais found himself {{in the midst of the}} battle, in the field of Isberg, covering the withdrawal of Portuguese and British soldiers. Within a few hours, 1,938 men had been killed, 5,198 wounded and about 7,000 taken prisoner. Milhais was in charge of a Lewis gun on 9 April 1918. During Operation Georgette, when the German Army attacked his division, Milhais laid down intensive fire against assaults by two German regiments, causing many German casualties. He managed to cover the retreat of Portuguese and British alike, despite coming under heavy attack himself. He fired in all directions and stayed at his post until he ran out of ammunition. Finally, the Germans decided to go around his position, and Milhais found himself alone in the rear of the enemy lines for three days. On the third day, Milhais, still carrying his Lewis gun, rescued a Scottish major from a swamp, and the two reached Allied lines. Milhais was warmly welcomed, but being a modest man he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about his experiences.
