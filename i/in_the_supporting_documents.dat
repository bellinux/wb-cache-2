40|$|Abstract. A common task in many {{applications}} {{is to find}} persons who are knowledgeable about a given topic (i. e., expert finding). In this paper, we propose and develop a general probabilistic framework for studying expert finding problem and derive two families of generative models (candidate generation models and topic generation models) from the framework. These models subsume most existing language models proposed for expert finding. We further propose several techniques to improve the estimation of the proposed models, including incorporating topic expansion, using a mixture model to model candidate mentions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>documents,</b> and defining an email count-based prior in the topic generation model. Our experiments show that the proposed estimation strategies are all effective to improve retrieval accuracy. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} our {{experiments}} in the TREC 2006 Enterprise Track. Our focus is to study a language model for expert finding. We extend an existing language model for expert retrieval in three aspects. First, we model the document-expert association using a mixure model instead of name matching heuristics as in the existing work; such a mixture model allows us to put different weights on email matching and name matching. Second, we propose to model the prior of an expert based on the counts of email matches <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>documents</b> instead of using uniform prior {{as in the previous}} work. Finally, we perform topic expansion and generalize the model from computing the likelihood to computing the cross entropy. Our experiments show that the first two extensions are more effective than the third extension, though when optimized, they all seem to be effective. ...|$|E

40|$|Motivation: Genome-wide {{association}} studies (GWASs) {{are commonly}} applied on human genomic data {{to understand the}} causal gene combinations statistically connected to certain diseases. Patients involved in these GWASs could be re-identified when the studies release statistical infor-mation on {{a large number of}} single-nucleotide polymorphisms.

40|$|Asthma is {{a common}} chronic airway disease and about 235 - 300 million {{individuals}} of all ages {{are affected by the}} disease around the world. A precondition of asthma has been suggested to increase individual susceptibility to acute exposure from airborne irritant chemicals. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> health risk assessments of such chemicals, acute guideline values are derived to guide in preparedness and in emergency response, and to protect the general population, including susceptible subpopulations such as asthmatics. Experimental data on susceptible subpopulations are lacking for many chemicals and default inter-individual assessment factors (AFs) have been applied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> derivation of guideline values. However, the scientific basis for these default AFs in regard to asthmatics has been inadequate. The aims of this thesis were threefold. First, to study the extent to which experimental data regarding chemicals tested on asthmatics are included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> derivation of different sets of acute to short-term guideline values, and second, to determine whether there is a general difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> airway response between healthy and asthmatic individuals, and whether current AFs for inter-individual variability provide sufficient protection for asthmatics. Last, to gain more knowledge on the susceptibility of asthmatics by measuring the airway response to chlorine in naïve and allergen-sensitized mice. <b>In</b> Paper I, <b>the</b> analysis of how asthmatics are considered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> derivation of Acute Exposure Guideline Levels (AEGLs) reveals that only 14 of 250 chemicals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>documents</b> had been tested on asthmatic subjects in experimental studies. A comparison between <b>the</b> AEGL <b>support</b> <b>documents</b> and nine other sets of acute to short-term guideline values shows that all of them were incomplete with respect to experimental data on asthmatics. In Paper II, experimental studies in which both healthy and asthmatic subjects were tested under the same conditions served as the basis for evaluating the lowest observed adverse effect concentrations (LOAECs) for healthy subjects and for asthmatic subjects. The ratios of these LOAECs were calculated and presented as estimated differential response factors (EDRFs). We found evidence of higher sensitivity among asthmatics (EDRF > 1) to 8 of 19 tested chemicals, and to 3 of 11 mixtures. Thereafter, concentration–response relationships confirmed the higher sensitivity of asthmatics to sulfuric acid and sulfur dioxide, and the Benchmark concentration (BMC) analysis of sulfur dioxide indicated a nine fold higher sensitivity among asthmatics. <b>In</b> Paper III, <b>the</b> consideration of asthmatics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Derived NoEffect Levels (DNEL), developed under the European Union (EU) registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals (REACH) legislation revealed that only 14 registered chemicals had been tested on asthmatics in experimental studies. Many of the DNELs for acute inhalation were higher than our estimated overall LOAEC or no observed adverse effect concentrations (NOAECs) in asthmatics, indicating a low or no safety margin. The experimental asthma model in Paper IV showed that exposure to 80 ppm of chlorine in naïve (but not OVA-sensitized) mice resulted in increased airway responsiveness and elevated numbers of neutrophils <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Concentrationdependent reductions in respiratory frequency were seen in both groups. These results do not support an increased susceptibility to chlorine among mice with induced eosinophilic airway inflammation. Exclusion of asthmatics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> derivation of acute to short-term guideline values may interfere with trustful and efficient health-protective actions. The use of an AF of 10 when {{there is a lack of}} experimental data on asthmatics may be adequate to protect this subpopulation from the deleterious respiratory effects of airborne chemicals...|$|R

Obviously, both coins were issued by Pontius Pilate AD 30 - 31 and a good coin should have the complete set of letters, TIBERIOY KAICAPOC. The obverse side could have either LIZ (year 17) or LIH(year 18) from the accession of Tiberius which would be equivalent to AD 30 / 31 It could be argued the coins were minted in AD 30, hence a case made for an AD 30 Crucifixion date, but the coins could as well be of AD 31 Furthermore, if we look for Good Friday on Nisan 15, we find that from AD 29 through 33 only AD 33 calendar can be used, and Nisan 15 falls on Gregorian date April 1, AD 33.

Symptomatic fruit carries more Xcc cells than asymptomatic fruit and the packinghouse disinfectant treatments do not achieve the eradication of Xcc. The application of management option 2 (i. e. „allow distribution of all types and varieties of commercially packed citrus fruit to all US States, subject to packinghouse treatment with APHIS-approved disinfectant.

40|$|Numeracy {{skills are}} a key driver of {{economic}} growth and yet, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS 2008) nearly eight million Australian adults lack the numeracy skills to cope with everyday life and work. The vocational education and training (VET) sector is {{one part of the}} solution; however the VET workforce may be limited by its own skills needs. There is no research available to indicate what the implications are for the delivery of adult numeracy skills training <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace and for building the skills capacity of workers to effectively and adequately meet business needs. This study begins to redress this gap by examining the capacity of the VET workforce to address workplace numeracy skills needs, particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process manufacturing industries, industries that rely greatly on the numeracy skills of its semi-skilled workers. While this study is small, it does raise questions about the capacity of the current VET workforce to address the numeracy skills gaps of existing workers. The research questions examined were as follows. The term ‘VET practitioner’ is used to refer to language, literacy and numeracy (LLN) specialists and vocational specialists collectively. 	What numeracy teaching qualifications and experience do VET practitioners have? 	To what extent do VET practitioners understand the importance of the numeracy skills of working-aged Australians generally and, specifically, of existing workers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process manufacturing industries? 	What are the perceived and actual numeracy skills levels of VET practitioners? 	What numeracy skills gaps are preventing VET practitioners from effectively addressing the numeracy skills needs of existing workers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process manufacturing industries? 	What is the capacity of Australian VET practitioners to address the numeracy skills needs of working-aged Australians? Both qualitative (self-assessments, focus group discussions, interviews) and quantitative (numeracy assessments) approaches were used. The numeracy assessments comprised an assessment tool developed specifically for the research project. The assessment questions were contextualised to the process manufacturing industries and mapped to the Australian Core Skills Framework (ACSF), with a focus on numeracy levels 3 and 41. All data-collection tools are included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>document.</b> <b>The</b> sample included 44 VET practitioners from Melbourne and Sydney who deliver workplace-based training. Of these, 20 self-identified as LLN specialists and 24 self-identified as vocational specialists. Participants were approached {{on the basis of their}} attendance at state-based Australian WELL 2  Practitioner Network meetings or as vocational trainers working at registered training organisations active <b>in</b> <b>the</b> delivery of process manufacturing qualifications. Minor differences in skills, qualifications and experiences relevant to adult numeracy training were found between the two groups. The research found that participants tended to have a limited understanding of the importance of numeracy in general but demonstrated an interest and a willingness to reflect on it and adapt their thinking. It was further found that participants had a limited focus on workplace numeracy. This was confirmed by participant accounts of their experience in delivering workplace numeracy skills. The numeracy skills delivery that was identified was described by participants as at a ‘basic’ level. Most LLN specialists reported rare and only incidental delivery of workplace numeracy skills training, while most vocational specialists reported delivering workplace numeracy skills training more often, as specified <b>in</b> <b>the</b> unit requirements within qualifications. None of the participants had a specialist adult numeracy training qualification, not surprising given that only one qualification, <b>the</b> Graduate Certificate <b>in</b> Adult Numeracy Teaching, was found to be available. Six participants were identified as having an adult training specialisation that included a numeracy component, including one participant with the Vocational Graduate Certificate in Adult Language, Literacy and Numeracy Practice, one with the Advanced Diploma of Language, Literacy and Numeracy Practice in VET and four with an adult basic education qualification. Adult numeracy specialist qualifications are discussed <b>in</b> relation to <b>the</b> United Kingdom’s Skills for Life Program, where there is a separate diploma-level qualification for each specialty area, and VET practitioners seeking to qualify as an adult numeracy specialist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom must undertake a numeracy proficiency entry test. The research draws attention to the unreliability of numeracy self-assessment and consequently the importance of the numeracy testing of trainers, with participants generally overestimating their numeracy skills. Best practice numeracy assessment scoring methods used for this research is questioned with respect to its suitability for determining VET practitioner preparedness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace context. The analysis of the numeracy assessment data showed that most participants had numeracy proficiency skills levels below <b>the</b> current benchmark <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Vocational Graduate Certificate in Adult Language, Literacy and Numeracy Practice, the nationally recognised qualification applicable to those with responsibility for adult literacy and numeracy training. The benchmark is questioned by the researchers as being too low by comparison with the standard suggested by international research and adopted by the United Kingdom’s Skills for Life Program. The report also explores the differences between numeracy and mathematics, the characteristics of numeracy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace context and the implications for pedagogy and numeracy assessment. Based on the findings, it appears there is a mismatch between what is required to address numeracy skills needs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process manufacturing industries and the current capacity of VET practitioners, in terms of their understanding of numeracy requirements, and their qualifications, skills and experience. 1  The Australian Core Skills Framework describes performance in five core skills: learning, reading, writing, oral communication and numeracy. Within each core skill there are five performance levels ranging from 1 (low level) through to 5 (high level performance). 2  Workplace English Language and Literacy Program...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} an up-to-date analysis of poverty patterns and trends in Ghana, {{based on the}} results of the Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS). The GLSS is a multi-topic household survey, designed to provide comprehensive information on the living standards of Ghanaian households. So far, four rounds have been completed (in 1987 / 1988, 1988 / 1989, 1991 / 1992 and 1998 / 1999), each round covering a nationally representative sample of households spread over a full 12 -month period. This report focuses on the last two rounds, tracing poverty trends <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990 s. The report examines poverty patterns and trends from three broad perspectives: consumption poverty, household assets, and human development. It aims to help improve understanding of living conditions in Ghana, especially among the poorer segments of the population. This report should help planners and policy makers in Ghana design and implement appropriate poverty reduction strategies. The Statistical Service has also published a companion report, providing more comprehensive description of the results of GLSS 4 (1998 / 1999). In addition to preparing these reports, the Statistical Service is keen to conduct further analysis of these data, and to encourage others to analyze <b>the</b> GLSS <b>in</b> order to inform public policy. This report has been prepared by the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS). The research team responsible for the background analysis and preparation of the report comprised Harold Coulombe and Andrew McKay, under the overall supervision of Dr. Kwaku A. Twum-Baah (Acting Government Statistician). Adams Kasanga, Abena Ani and Jacqueline Anum of the GSS provided key technical support.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{breeding}} biology of the African Swallow-tailed Kite (Chelictinia riocourii) in two study areas located 3400 km apart <b>in</b> <b>the</b> central (Cameroon) and western (Senegal) {{portions of the}} species' breeding range. With 110 nests in 2. 8 km 2 of suitable breeding habitat, Kousmar islet (23 km 2) <b>in</b> Senegal <b>supports</b> <b>the</b> largest <b>documented</b> colony of African Swallow-tailed Kites known to date. Breeding kites in Senegal nested in a single large colony near a massive winter roost. In Cameroon, breeding colonies averaged seven pairs/colony, with nest densities of 0. 3 nests/km 2 in protected woodland and 0. 9 nests/km 2 in cultivated habitat. Egg-laying coincided {{with the end of}} <b>the</b> dry season <b>in</b> Cameroon, but eggs were recorded from the middle of <b>the</b> dry season <b>in</b> Senegal. Eggs hatched between April and June in both study sites in 2010, but from March 2012 <b>in</b> Senegal. <b>The</b> incubation period was estimated at 27 – 31 d based on two nests, and the fledging period was 32 – 35 d (n ¿=¿ 3 fledglings). Mean clutch size was 2. 5 eggs (n ¿=¿ 32) in Cameroon and 2. 1 in Senegal (n ¿=¿ 29); one clutch of four eggs was recorded in Cameroon. Nest success estimated with the Mayfield method was low at 17 % in Cameroon and exceptionally low at 4 % in Senegal, possibly related to a combination of suboptimal food conditions, high predation pressure, intraspecific aggression, and lack of experience among breeding pairs. Prey items at nests were made up primarily of lizards (30 – 54 % of items) and insects (27 – 49 %), notably grasshoppers, whereas the diet at <b>the</b> winter roost <b>in</b> Senegal was predominantly Orthoptera (55 %) and Solifugids (43 %).

A more detailed description of the research, rationale and methods appears <b>in</b> <b>the</b> list of <b>supporting</b> <b>documents</b> from which this document has been derived. <b>In</b> brief, <b>the</b> findings of IFPRI’s evaluation are that after just three years, the poor children of Mexico <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rural areas where PROGRESA is currently operating are more likely to enroll in school, are eating more diversified diets, getting more frequent health care and learning that the future may look quite different from the past. The majority of the evaluation findings suggest that PROGRESA’s combination of education, health, and nutrition interventions into one integrated package can be an effective means of breaking the intergenerational transmission of poverty. However, PROGRESA is still in its beginning stages. Many of the impacts of the program are likely to manifest themselves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future. Clearly, <b>the</b> simultaneous intervention <b>in</b> <b>the</b> health and nutrition of 0 to 5 year old children of poor households today will positively reinforce school attendance, performance and attainment of children tomorrow. Thus, <b>in</b> addition to <b>the</b> benefits measured after three years of operation, it is likely that PROGRESA will have additional benefits in future years. Whether the vicious cycle of poverty and its intergenerational transmission are indeed broken can only be determined by continuing with PROGRESA and continuing to evaluate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> medium and long run its impact on the livelihood of Mexico’s poor. The possibility of expanding the coverage of PROGRESA to poor households in urban areas implies that there is opportunity to use program evaluation, such as that presented herein, as a means to adapt some of the components of the program to suit the needs of households <b>in</b> different environments. <b>The</b> IFPRI research team would encourage Mexico’s policy leaders to capitalize on the innovative precedent established by PROGRESA and to consider program evaluation as an indispensable component of all social policies.
