5|$|A {{group of}} six Serbian nationalists, among them Boško Radonjić, placed a home-made bomb {{in the home of}} the Yugoslav {{consulate}} in Chicago in 1975. Radonjić later became the leader of the Westies gang in New York City, where he participated in organized crime and racketeering. He eventually {{became one of the most}} feared gangsters in the New York City underworld, and developed extensive friendships with Vojislav Stanimirović, <b>John</b> <b>Gotti</b> and the Gambino family. After Sammy Gravano turned <b>John</b> <b>Gotti</b> in to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in December 1990, Radonjić was highly suspected to have attempted to fix the trial on John Gotti's behalf. As a result of this, Radonjić was arrested on December 1999 during a spectacular rerouted plane going to Cuba to a lockdown at Miami International Airport when he was tracked down by the FBI. He was arrested in the United States again in January 2000 for further investigation of the 1992 Gotti trial. Upon release in 2001, he left the United States and moved back to Serbia where he lived until his death in 2011. He was also an admirer and long-time friend of Radovan Karadžić until the latter went into hiding in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Before Massino became boss, <b>John</b> <b>Gotti</b> {{was one of}} {{his closest}} allies. Massino had backed Gotti in his plot to take over the Gambino family, and as Gambino boss, Gotti tried to get Massino a seat on the Commission as the Bonannos' acting boss. Gotti was {{reportedly}} infuriated that Massino had been officially promoted without him being consulted, and Massino would later testify he believed Gotti conspired with Vitale to kill him. Gotti, however, was marginalized by his 1992 racketeering and murder conviction and consequent life imprisonment. Massino, for his own part, was angered at Gotti's high public profile and later criticized Gotti for killing his predecessor Paul Castellano. Massino also had a poor relationship with Vincent Gigante, who had backed the opposition to Rastelli and blocked Gotti's attempts to bring Massino onto the Commission.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1960s Massino was a Bonanno associate. He led a {{successful}} truck hijacking crew, {{with the assistance}} of his brother-in-law Salvatore Vitale and carjacker Duane Leisenheimer, while fencing the stolen goods and running numbers using the lunch wagon as a front. He also befriended another mob hijacker, future Gambino crime family boss <b>John</b> <b>Gotti.</b> Increasingly prosperous, Massino opened his own catering company, J Catering, which became another front for his activities. Massino's mentor Rastelli was expected to become Bonanno boss upon the 1973 death of Natale Evola, but he had been convicted the previous year of loansharking and then in 1976 of extortion, leaving him imprisoned. In his absence Carmine Galante, a former consigliere and convicted drug trafficker, seized control of the Bonannos as unofficial acting boss.|$|E

25|$|Castellano's {{most vocal}} critic was <b>John</b> <b>Gotti,</b> a Queens-based capo and Dellacroce protégé. Gotti was ambitious {{and wanted to}} be boss himself. He was also angry that Castellano allowed the DeMeo crew to deal in {{narcotics}} while forbidding him from doing it. Gotti and his men conducted their drug trade in secret. The 1983 Ruggiero indictment came from phone conversations that Federal agents had recorded on Gotti's phone. The taped conversations included Ruggiero discussing drug deals and expressing his contempt for Castellano. By law, the defendants were allowed transcripts of these wiretap conversations to aid their defense. Castellano immediately demanded copies for himself. Dellacroce kept the transcripts from Castellano – the drug dealing and disrespectful language on the transcripts would have given Castellano cause to kill both Ruggiero and <b>John</b> <b>Gotti.</b> In turn, Dellacroce prevented Gotti from deposing Castellano, citing his promise to Carlo Gambino.|$|E

5000|$|Despite everyone's low {{expectations}} for Peter Gotti, {{he was soon}} fulfilling a more {{important role in the}} family.

25|$|In 1994, Casso {{revealed}} that two respected New York City police detectives worked as hitmen and informants for Casso during the 1980s and early 1990s before their retirement. They were Louis Eppolito and Stephen Caracappa, who {{spent much of}} their combined 44 years with the NYPD committing murders and leaking confidential information to the Lucchese family. Between 1986 and 1990, Eppolito and Caracappa participated in eight murders and received $375,000 from Casso in bribes and payments for murder 'contracts'. Casso used Caracappa and Eppolito to pressure the Gambino crime family by murdering several of their members. This is because Casso, along with the imprisoned Amuso and Genovese crime family boss Vincent Gigante, wanted their rival <b>John</b> <b>Gotti</b> out of the way. Caracappa and Eppolito are now seen as {{the main source of}} 'tension' between these three families during the late 1980s and early 1990s.|$|E
