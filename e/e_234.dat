40|$|Protein folding {{homeostasis}} in the {{endoplasmic reticulum}} (ER) is defended by an unfolded protein response that matches ER chaperone capacity to {{the burden of}} unfolded proteins. As levels of unfolded proteins decline, a metazoan-specific FIC-domain-containing ER-localized enzyme (FICD) rapidly inactivates the major ER chaperone BiP by AMPylating T 518. Here we show that the single catalytic domain of FICD can also release the attached AMP, restoring functionality to BiP. Consistent with a role for endogenous FICD in de-AMPylating BiP, FICD_-/- hamster cells are hypersensitive to introduction of a constitutively AMPylating, de-AMPylation-defective mutant FICD. These opposing activities hinge on a regulatory residue, <b>E</b> <b>234,</b> whose default state renders FICD a constitutive de-AMPylase in vitro. The location of <b>E</b> <b>234</b> on a conserved regulatory helix and the mutually antagonistic activities of FICD in vivo, suggest a mechanism whereby fluctuating unfolded protein load actively switches FICD from a de-AMPylase to an AMPylase.

40|$|The {{survival}} protein SurE from Salmonella typhimurium (StSurE) is a dimeric {{protein that}} {{functions as a}} phosphatase. SurE dimers are formed by the swapping of a loop {{with a pair of}} beta-strands and a C-terminal helix between two protomers. In a previous study, the Asp 230 and His 234 residues were mutated to Ala to abolish a hydrogen bond that was thought to be crucial for C-terminal helix swapping. These mutations led to functionally inactive and distorted dimers in which the two protomers were related by a rotation of 167 degrees. New salt bridges involving Glu 112 were observed in the dimeric interface of the H 234 A and D 230 A/H 234 A mutants. To explore the role of these salt bridges in the stability of the distorted structure, E 112 A, E 112 A/D 230 A, <b>E</b> 112 A/H <b>234</b> A, <b>E</b> 112 A/D 230 A/H 234 A, R 179 L/H 180 A/H <b>234</b> A and <b>E</b> 112 A/R 179 L/H 180 A/H 234 A mutants were constructed.

40|$|Shiga toxin type 1 (Stx 1) {{belongs to}} the Shiga family of bipartite AB toxins that {{inactivate}} eukaryotic 60 S ribosomes. The A subunit of Stxs are N-glycosidases that share structural and functional features in their catalytic center and in an internal hydrophobic region that shows strong transmembrane propensity. Both features are conserved in ricin and other ribosomal inactivating proteins. During eukaryotic cell intoxication, holotoxin likely moves retrograde from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum. The hydrophobic region, spanning residues I 224 through N 241 in the Stx 1 A subunit (Stx 1 A), was hypothesized to participate in toxin translocation across internal target cell membranes. The TMpred computer program was used to design a series of site-specific mutations in this hydrophobic region that disrupt transmembrane propensity to various degrees. Mutations were synthesized by PCR overlap extension and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutants StxAF 226 Y, A 231 D, G <b>234</b> <b>E,</b> and A 231 D-G <b>234</b> <b>E</b> and wild-type Stx 1 A were expressed in Escherichia coli SY 327 and purified by dye-ligand affinity chromatography.

40|$|The {{final step}} in the {{biosynthesis}} of the plant signaling molecule ethylene is catalyzed by 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylate (ACC) oxidase, {{a member of the}} non-heme iron(II) dependent family of oxygenases and oxidases, which has a requirement for ascorbate as a co-substrate and carbon dioxide as an activator. ACC oxidase (tomato) has a particularly short half-life under catalytic conditions undergoing metal-catalyzed oxidative (MCO) fragmentation. Sequence comparisons of ACC oxidases with isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) and members of the 2 -oxoglutarate Fe(II) dependent dioxygenases show an aspartate and two of six ACC oxidase conserved histidine residues are completely conserved throughout this subfamily of Fe(II) dependent oxygenases/oxidases. Previous mutagenesis, spectroscopic, and crystallographic studies on IPNS indicate that the two completely conserved histidine and aspartate residues act as Fe(II) ligands. To investigate the role of the conserved aspartate and histidine residues in ACC oxidase (tomato fruit), they were substituted via site-directed mutagenesis. Modified ACC oxidases produced were H 39 Q, H 56 Q, H 94 Q, H 177 Q, H 177 D, H 177 E, D 179 E, D 179 N, H 177 DandD 179 E, H 211 Q, H 234 Q, H 234 D, and H <b>234</b> <b>E.</b> Among those histidine mutants replaced by glutamine, H 39 Q, H 56 Q, H 94 Q, and H 211 Q were catalytically active, indicating these histidines are not essential for catalysis.

Replacement of H 177 with glutamate or D 179 with glutamate resulted in modified ACC oxidases which still effected the conversion of ACC to ethylene, albeit at a very low level of activity, which was stimulated by bicarbonate. The H 177 D (inactive), H 177 E (low activity), D 179 E (low activity), and H 234 Q (inactive) modified ACC oxidases all underwent MCO fragmentation, indicating that they can bind iron, dioxygen, ACC, and ascorbate. The results suggest that MCO cleavage results from active site-mediated reactions and imply that, while H 177, D 179, and H 234 are all involved in metal ligation during catalysis, ligation to H 234 is not required for fragmentation. It is possible that MCO fragmentation results from reaction of incorrectly folded or "primed" ACC oxidase...|$|R

40|$|G protein-gated {{inwardly}} rectifying K+ channels (GIRKs) are {{activated by}} a direct interaction with Gbetagamma subunits {{and also by}} raised internal [Na+]. Both processes require the presence of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP 2). Here we show that the proximal C-terminal region of GIRK 2 mediates the Na+-dependent activation of both the GIRK 2 homomeric channels and the GIRK 1 /GIRK 2 heteromeric channels. Within this region, GIRK 2 has an aspartate at position 226, whereas GIRK 1 has an asparagine at the equivalent position (217). A single point mutation, D 226 N, in GIRK 2, abolished the Na+-dependent activation of both the homomeric and heteromeric channels. Neutralizing a nearby negative charge, <b>E</b> <b>234</b> S had no effect. The reverse mutation in GIRK 1, N 217 D, was sufficient to restore Na+-dependent activation to the GIRK 1 N 217 D/GIRK 2 D 226 N heteromeric channels. The D 226 N mutation did not alter either the single channel properties or the ability of these channels to be activated via the m 2 -muscarinic receptor. PIP 2 dramatically increased the open probability of GIRK 1 /GIRK 2 channels {{in the absence of}} Na+ or Gbetagamma but did not preclude further activation by Na+, suggesting that Na+ is not acting simply to promote PIP 2 binding to GIRKs. We conclude that aspartate 226 in GIRK 2 plays a crucial role in Na+-dependent gating of GIRK 1 /GIRK 2 channels...|$|E

We identified key residues required for the self-association of HrpR (D 32, E 202 and K 235) with HrpS (D 32, E 200 and K 233), showed that the HrpR D 32 and HrpS K 233 residues form interacting pairs directly involved in an HrpR-HrpS association and that the change in side-chain length at position 233 in HrpS affects self-association and interaction with the HrpR and demonstrated that the HrpS D 32, E 200 and K 233 are not involved in negative regulation imposed by HrpV. We established that the equivalent residues K 30, E 200 and <b>E</b> <b>234</b> in a homo-oligomeric bEBP, PspF, are required for the subunit communication and formation of an oligomeric lock that cooperates with the ATP γ-phosphate sensing PspF residue R 227, providing insights into their roles in the heteromeric HrpRS co-complex...|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} isolated a Brassica juncea cDNA encoding BjCHI 1, a novel chitinase {{with two}} chitin-binding domains. Synthesis of its mRNA is induced by wounding, methyl jasmonate treatment, Aspergillus niger infection and caterpillar (Pieris rapae) feeding, {{suggesting that the}} protein has a role in defense. In that it possesses two chitin-binding domains, BjCHI 1 resembles the precursor of Urtica dioica agglutinin but unlike that protein, BjCHI 1 retains its chitinase catalytic domain after post-translational processing. To explore the properties of multi-domain BjCHI 1, we have expressed recombinant BjCHI 1 and two derivatives, which lack one (BjCHI 2) or both (BjCHI 3) chitin-binding domains, as secreted proteins in Pichia pastoris. Recombinant BjCHI 1 and BjCHI 2 showed apparent molecular masses on SDS-PAGE larger than calculated, and could be deglycosylated using α-mannosidase. Recombinant BjCHI 3, without the proline/ threonine-rich linker region containing predicted O-glycosylation sites, {{did not appear to}} be processed by α-mannosidase. BjCHI 1 's ability to agglutinate rabbit erythrocytes is unique among known chitinases. Both chitin-binding domains are essential for agglutination; this property is absent in recombinant BjCHI 2 and BjCHI 3. To identify potential catalytic residues, we generated site-directed mutations in recombinant BjCHI 3. Mutation E 212 A showed the largest effect, exhibiting 0 % of wild-type specific activity. H 211 N and R 361 A resulted in considerable (> 91 %) activity loss, implying these charged residues are also important in catalysis. <b>E</b> <b>234</b> A showed 36 % retention of activity and substitution Y 269 D, 50 %.

40|$|The {{intensity}} of biogenic sediment mixing is often {{expressed as a}} &#x 201 c;biodiffusion coefficient&#x 201 d; (D b), quantified by fitting a diffusive model of bioturbation to vertical profiles of particle-bound radioisotopes. The biodiffusion coefficient often exhibits a dependence on tracer half-life: short-lived radioisotopes (<b>e.</b> g. <b>234</b> Th) tend to yield notably larger D b values than longer-lived radioisotopes (e. g. 210 Pb). It has been hypothesized {{that this is a}} result of differential mixing of tracers by particle-selective benthos. This study employs a lattice-automaton model of bioturbation to explore how steady-state tracers with different half-lives are mixed in typical marine settings. Every particle in the model is tagged with the same array of radioisotopes, so that all tracers experienced exactly the same degree of mixing. Two different estimates of the mixing intensity are calculated: a tracer-derived D b, obtained in the standard way by fitting the biodiffusion model to resulting tracer profiles, and a particle-tracking D b, derived from the statistics of particle movements. The latter provides a tracer-independent measure of mixing for use as a reference. Our simulations demonstrate that an apparent D b tracer-dependence results from violating the underlying assumptions of the biodiffusion model. Breakdown of the model is rarely apparent from tracer profiles, emphasizing the need to evaluate the model&#x 2019;s criteria from biological and ecological parameters, rather than relying on obvious indications of model breakdown, e. g., subsurface maxima. Simulations of various marine environments (coastal, slope, abyssal) suggest that the time scales of short-lived radioisotopes, such as 234 Th and 7 Be, are insufficient for the tracers to be used with the biodiffusion model. 210 Pb appears an appropriate tracer for abyssal sediments, while 210 Pb and 228 Th are suitable for slope and coastal sediments...|$|R

40|$|The Endosomal sorting complex {{required}} for transport (ESCRT) machinery facilitates the trafficking of ubiquitylated proteins from endosomes to lysosomes via the multivesicular bodies (MVBs) in yeast and mammals. Its components {{are arranged in}} three subcomplexes and associated proteins. The ESCRT complexes play critical roles in receptor downregulation, retroviral budding, and protein sorting. Disassembly of ESCRT complexes from endosomal membranes during the last stage of sorting is mediated by the AAA ATPaseVps 4. In my thesis I have investigated two aspects of ESCRTs function in Arabidopsis thaliana. Analysis of the interactions of ESCRT homologous proteins of Arabidopsis by yeast two hybrid and BiFC assays showed that an interaction network of the ESCRT homologues in Arabidopsis exists. Vps 23 /ELCH plays {{a central role in}} the plant ESCRT machinery. It directly interacts with putative upstream ESCRT components and also ESCRT II and ESCRT III. In this study I found a TOM 1 homologue and a member of a novel class of plant specific FYVE proteins that interact with ELCH suggesting that they might recruit cargo protein in Arabidopsis instead of Vps 27 and HSE 1 which are not exist in Arabidopsis genome. In the second part of my thesis I examined the role of AtSKD 1 in ESCRT pathway in Arabidopsis. I identified one sequence homologue of Vps 4 in Arabidopsis (AtSKD 1). Yeast two hybrid and BiFC assays detected binding of AtSKD 1 to the ESCRT III complex and regulatory proteins like AtLIP 5, Vps 60 and Vps 46. In additio YFP-AtSKD 1 colocalizes with endosomal markers such as Ara 6 and Ara 7, and endocytic marker dye FM 4 - 64 in Arabidopsis protoplasts.

MÉTODO: Entre outubro de 1991 e julho de 2003, 273 prematuros e prematuros extremos foram submetidos à ligadura cirúrgica do canal arterial por toracotomia miopreservadora, com anestesia geral, em UTI neonatal. Os dados demográficos pré-operatórios e os desfechos de mortalidade e eventos adversos foram, retrospectivamente, avaliados por meio de consulta aos prontuários. RESULTADOS: Não houve óbito relacionado com o ato operatório <b>e</b> <b>234</b> (86 %) pacientes tiveram alta hospitalar. Os 39 óbitos ocorreram entre o 1 º e o 51 º dias e foram atribuídos à sepse (14 pacientes), hemorragia intracraniana (11 pacientes) e enterocolite necrotizante (nove pacientes), todas causas inerentes à prematuridade. Em cinco pacientes, a causa não foi adequadamente estabelecida. As complicações mais freqüentes relacionadas ao procedimento foram: pneumotórax 3, 3 % (nove pacientes) e hemorragia 1, 4 % (quatro pacientes). CONCLUSÕES: A técnica de toracotomia minimamente invasiva para a ligadura do canal arterial quando realizada em prematuros e prematuros extremos é aplicável, segura, eficaz, relacionada à baixa morbidade e não depende da estrutura hospitalar local. OBJECTIVES: To {{analyze the}} feasibility, the safety, {{and the primary}} outcomes of a minimally invasive thoracotomy for the occlusion of ligamentum arteriosum (ductus arteriosus) in preterm infants. METHODS: Between October 1991 and June 2003, 273 preterm infants and very low birth weight preterm infants were submitted to a surgical occlusion of the ligamentum arteriosum (ductus arteriosus) through muscle-sparing thoracotomy under general anesthesia in the neonatal ICU. Pre-operative demographic data, mortality outcomes, and adverse events were retrospectively analyzed through medical records consultation. RESULTS:There were no deaths related to surgery, and 234 (86 %) patients were discharged from hospital. Thirty-nine deaths have occurred between the 1 st and the 51 st days. The {{cause of death was}} sepsis (14 patients); intracranial bleeding (11 patients); and necrotizing enterocolitis (9 patients). All causes were related to prematurity.

40|$|AbstractThe cytoplasmic {{surface of}} the BR (initial) state of {{bacteriorhodopsin}} {{is characterized by a}} cluster of three carboxylates that function as a proton-collecting antenna. Systematic replacement of most of the surface carboxylates indicated that the cluster is made of D 104, E 161, and <b>E</b> <b>234</b> (Checover, S., Y. Marantz, E. Nachliel, M. Gutman, M. Pfeiffer, J. Tittor, D. Oesterhelt, and N. Dencher. 2001. Biochemistry. 40 : 4281 – 4292), yet the BR state is a resting configuration; thus, its proton-collecting antenna can only indicate the presence of its role in the photo-intermediates where the protein is re-protonated by protons coming from the cytoplasmic matrix. In the present study we used the D 96 N and the triple (D 96 G/F 171 C/F 219 L) mutant for monitoring the proton-collecting properties of the protein in its late M state. The protein was maintained in a steady M state by continuous illumination and subjected to reversible pulse protonation caused by repeated excitation of pyranine present in the reaction mixture. The re-protonation dynamics of the pyranine anion was subjected to kinetic analysis, and the rate constants of the reaction of free protons with the surface groups and the proton exchange reactions between them were calculated. The reconstruction of the experimental signal indicated that the late M state of bacteriorhodopsin exhibits an efficient mechanism of proton delivery to the unoccupied—most basic—residue on its cytoplasmic surface (D 38), which exceeds that of the BR configuration of the protein. The kinetic analysis was carried out in conjunction with the published structure of the M state (Sass, H., G. Büldt, R. Gessenich, D. Hehn, D. Neff, R. Schlesinger, J. Berendzen, and P. Ormos. 2000. Nature. 406 : 649 – 653), the model that resolves most of the cytoplasmic surface. The combination of the kinetic analysis and the structural information led to identification of two proton-conducting tracks on the protein's surface that are funneling protons to D 38. One track is made of the carboxylate moieties of residues D 36 and E 237, while the other is made of D 102 and E 232. In the late M state the carboxylates of both tracks are closer to D 38 than in the BR (initial) state, accounting for a more efficient proton equilibration between the bulk and the protein's proton entrance channel. The triple mutant resembles in the kinetic properties of its proton conducting surface more the BR-M state than the initial state confirming structural similarities with the BR-M state and differences to the BR initial state...|$|E

The difference in drug release values {{was found to be}} 100. 45 ± 1. 89 and 56. 47 ± 1. 89, respectively. To prevent bitter taste and unacceptable odour of the drug, the drug was taste masked with weak cation exchange resins like Indion 234, Indion 204 and Indion 414. The drug was characterized according to different compendial methods, on the basis of identification by UV spectroscopy, pH, organoleptic properties and other tests. Among the three resins, one was selected for further studies i. <b>e.,</b> Indion <b>234,</b> because of high drug loading capacity. Drug–resin complex was prepared using batch method and effect of various processing parameters viz. drug–resin ratio, pH, temperature and drug concentration was studied to optimize the loading conditions. Maximum loading was obtained at drug–resin ratio 1 : 2, pH 5, temperature 50 °C and drug concentration 4 mg/ml. A successful taste masking of resinate was confirmed by time intensity method and also by taking drug release in 0. 01 N hydrochloric acid and in simulated salivary fluid. The values of pre-compression parameters evaluated, were within prescribed limits and indicated good free flowing properties. The data obtained of post-compression parameters such as weight variation, hardness, friability, wetting time, water absorption ratio, content uniformity, disintegration time and dissolution and was found superior over conventional formulation. The F 5 batch with disintegration time 25. 24 ± 0. 75 and dissolution 100. 46 %± 3. 78 was selected as optimized formulation. This was compared with conventional marketed formulation and was found superior. Batch F 5 was also subjected to stability studies for three months and was tested for its disintegration time, drug contents and dissolution behaviour monthly.
