5000|$|George is {{the main}} character. He is in his 30’s and in his “real life” is married to Joyce. George is a stock broker and is {{brilliant}} at math. He discovered {{at a young age}} about alternate lives that he could live when he was young doing a math problem, or so he says. In reality all of this is constructed inside George’s brain and never really takes place {{as far as we can}} tell. George is the Protagonist of the play although some of his actions throughout the play pose as blocks to what he wants. What he wants is to be loved by Joyce and be in a relationship with Joyce in every world that he encounters. George is also a semi-static character as far as the worlds go. George is always George while other characters appear in way that they would not in the real world. George stays the same through the play so that the viewer can connect with him and feel bad for him at the end. He is the only main “human” character because of how he does not really change from one world to the next. Joyce is George’s real life wife. In every world he pursues her. Sometimes he is successful and sometimes not. Joyce is a scientist on some worlds, a stock broker in others and in one entirely different construct she is Jocelyn, the teacher of a meditation type class focused at increasing intelligence through imagination. Joyce is one of the main antagonists of the play in most worlds. Especially in the world where she has a boyfriend because George can not reach his goal at all in the world. Joyce is also an agent of action because without her decisions George could not further pursue his goals or change his tactics to pursue new goals. [...] Berkely and Williams are detectives and they are in the real world. They are the voice of Justice and the morals in the world. They are pitted against the scientist and they tend to show that they feel bad for the brains being kept alive by Pensfield. They question Pensfield right to experiment on the brains while searching for the murderer of their case who turns out to be Pensfield. [...] Pensfield is the neurologist who is killing people and stealing their brains. In this plot line, which includes Berkely and Williams he is not only the antagonist but the bad guy. Pensfield shows up throughout the play as the Guide, the Scientist and the Doctor. Pensfield causes discomfort in the characters and the viewer and forces them to think about questions in morality, especially concerning science and man. The question that immediately jumps out is, <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>ok</b> <b>to</b> kill in the name of scientific advancement? The man is the caretaker of George’s building. He goes to the detectives with a story of seeing UFO lights the night that George was killed. They don’t believe him of course even when he says that “they” are going to kill him. Later the man shows up dead, frozen to death at room temperature which makes the detectives question what they are dealing with in these cases.|$|E

[...] "Do you agree there were instances where Dr. Murray deviated from {{standard of care}} on June 25, 2009?" [...] "Yes". Walgren asked [...] "have you ever administered propofol in someone's bedroom?" [...] "No". [...] "Have you heard anyone else doing it?" [...] "No." [...] Dr. White agrees Dr. Murray deviated from the 'standard of care' of Jackson but doesn't know to what degree. [...] "Do you disagree with Dr. Shafer's opinion that failure to keep medical records 'egregious and unconscionable' deviation?" [...] White doesn't know what the words egregious and unconscionable mean in this case. [...] "Would you administer propofol to a patient without proper airway-opening equipment?" [...] "I would certainly have means for ventilation, means of ventilation could be an ambu bag and a mask, not necessarily other respiratory equipment". It was heard that Dr. White has received $11,000 so far for his testimony in this case. He usually charges $3,500 per day and any expenses such as airfares. He doesn't think the defense have this much so will not bill them that much. Dr. Safer testified for many days, and performed numerous simulations for both the prosecution and defense for free. [...] "Was Dr. Murray offered money to provide Jackson's propofol?" [...] "It is my understanding that Dr. Murray was offered money to be Jackson's personal doctor." [...] Walgren then asked [...] "If you injected 25 mg propofol, <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>ok</b> <b>to</b> {{walk out of the}} room?" [...] "25 mg only lasts 15-30 minutes, after that I see no problem in leaving the patient's bedside." [...] "If the patient liked to 'push' propofol themselves, would you walk out of room?" [...] "No." [...] Upon being asked about Murray's actions after he found Jackson, Dr. White said [...] "I would have done things differently. I would have called for help, called 911 and initiated CPR." [...] When being asked about Murray's delay to call 911 he stated [...] "I would have called 911 earlier but do not believe it would have made any difference in this case." [...] "3-5 minutes after finding him I would call 911." [...] It was heard that [...] "forgetting to mention propofol was a detail overlooked, could also be a lie?" [...] "Yes." [...] After Dr. White mentioned he believed that Jackson had his own stash of propofol, Walgren asked the judge to admonish witness to respond the question only. Judge asked jurors to leave the courtroom. Walgren asked [...] "Do you reject that Jackson drank propofol and that caused his death?" [...] "Yes. I speculated that oral administration may have played a role. I don't reject completely the self-administration theory. The evidence suggests that Jackson did not drink propofol". Flanagan then asked Dr. White: [...] "If patient died on noon, would it matter if help came 5 minutes later?" [...] "Unlikely." [...] Dr. White continued and added, [...] "Propofol does not have a reversal treatment, only treatment for propofol overdose is time." ...|$|E

40|$|Telo Tulku: Due to misunderstanding, people {{sacrifice}} animals. This is {{not what}} Buddhism is about. This is totally against Buddhist principles when people say that during gal tyalgn (fire rituals) they need to kill a sheep as an offering. I think in Mongolia people do similar rituals as well. Buddha taught non-violence, the sacredness of life, and prohibited killing any living being. When we say that by killing a sacrificial sheep we carry out purification, this is a complete contradiction to and misunderstanding of Buddhism. Sacrificing animals is a shamanistic tradition, not Buddhist tradition at all. In Kalmykia people sacrifice sheep less {{than they do in}} Mongolia. The number of sacrificial animals has declined in Kalmykia, because of our continuous explanations and criticising people who are doing these rituals. The situation is improving and people are starting to understand. Baasanjav: <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>OK</b> <b>to</b> substitute a real sheep with a statue of a sheep, for example? That is what some people do in Kalmykia. TT: I think that would be good enough. B: Do you think this mind-set is acceptable, given there is still this intention to sacrifice an animal?TT: We need to erase this intention. We {{have to get rid of}} it. We need to change this mind-set. There is nowhere in the Buddhist canons, scriptures or texts that says ‘you must sacrifice certain life for this ritual or for that prayer’. B: There are rituals called gazr usn tyaklgn. It is different from gal tyalgn…TT: Gazr tyaklgn is a ritual of the purification of land. For example, when you build a stupa you must purify the land, the earth. And that is when it is performed. Gazr tyalgn is more about offering incenses (Jupiter), flower, milk, honey, sugar, and various other substances. In some cases, people include pieces of meat in their offerings. B: <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>OK</b> <b>to</b> include meat or fat?TT: People use fat. I don’t like it, because of what it symbolises. B: <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>OK</b> <b>to</b> put butter?TT: Yes… You know about this offering of a sheep. For us, nomads, the sheep has been the most important animal for our survival. When you make offerings you give something that you value most in your life. And the sheep is something that we value as nomads. Therefore, we have this attitude ‘I am going to make this offering with a sheep’. That is how it all began. But in reality, this truly contradicts the principles of Buddhism and the teachings of Buddha when one takes the life of an animal and offers it as a sacrifice. B: Some people in Kalmykia call these rituals ‘clan rituals’. The idea is that it is family members who participate in these rituals and they are performed for the wellbeing of clans and not outsiders. TT: There are no such things as clan rituals. I do not believe in clan rituals. These are generic rituals. B: Should be for all people?TT: Yes. It is for all people. Arcadi...|$|E
