5|$|Inflammation of the cervix is {{referred}} to as cervicitis. This <b>inflammation</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> of the endocervix or ectocervix. When associated with the endocervix, it is associated with a mucous vaginal discharge and the sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea. As many as half of pregnant women having a gonorrheal infection of the cervix are asymptomatic. Other causes include overgrowth of the commensal flora of the vagina. When associated with the ectocervix, <b>inflammation</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> caused by the herpes simplex virus. Inflammation is often investigated through directly visualising the cervix using a speculum, which may appear whiteish due to exudate, and by taking a Pap smear and examining for causal bacteria. Special tests may be used to identify particular bacteria. If the inflammation is due to a bacterium, then antibiotics may be given as treatment.|$|E
25|$|Inflammation along any {{portion of}} the GI tract can lead to colic. This leads to pain and {{possibly}} stasis of peristalsis (Ileus), which can cause excessive accumulation of fluid in the gastrointestinal tract. This is a functional rather than mechanical blockage of the intestine, but like the mechanical blockage seen with simple obstructions, it can have serious effects including severe dehydration. Inflammation of the bowel may lead to increased permeability and subsequent endotoxemia. The underlying cause of <b>inflammation</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> due to infection, toxin, or trauma, and may require special treatment in order to resolve the colic.|$|E

40|$|Ocular <b>inflammations</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> due to {{a variety}} of diseases, and {{microorganisms}} {{play a major role in}} both acute and chronic eye diseases. Treatment of serious infections needs a good microbiological diagnostic. The indications and techniques for investigations are determined by the site of infection, severity of the process, and knowledge of the likely responsible organisms. Immediate inoculation of specimens on culture media in the examining room is often recommended. This article describes organisms associated with ocular infections, and is designed to assists ophthalmologists in the collection, processing and transport of specimens...|$|R
25|$|Specific pretreatments, {{drugs to}} prevent {{chemically}} induced lung injuries due to respiratory airway toxins, are not available. Analgesic medications, oxygen, humidification, and ventilator support currently constitute standard therapy. In fact, mechanical ventilation remains the therapeutic mainstay for acute inhalation injury. The cornerstone of treatment {{is to keep}} the PaO2 > 60 mmHg (8.0 kPa), without causing injury to the lungs with excessive O2 or volutrauma. Pressure control ventilation is more versatile than volume control, although breaths should be volume limited, to prevent stretch injury to the alveoli. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is used in mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS to improve oxygenation. Hemorrhaging, signifying substantial damage to the lining of the airways and lungs, can occur with exposure to highly corrosive chemicals and may require additional medical interventions. Corticosteroids are sometimes administered, and bronchodilators to treat bronchospasms. Drugs that reduce the inflammatory response, promote healing of tissues, and prevent the onset of pulmonary edema or secondary <b>inflammation</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> used following severe injury to prevent chronic scarring and airway narrowing.|$|E
2500|$|The primary {{pathologic}} change seen in {{atrial fibrillation}} is the progressive fibrosis of the atria. [...] This fibrosis is due primarily to atrial dilation; however, genetic causes and <b>inflammation</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> factors in some individuals. Dilation of the atria can {{be due to}} almost any structural abnormality of the heart that can cause {{a rise in the}} pressure within the heart. This includes valvular heart disease (such as mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation), hypertension, and congestive heart failure. [...] Any inflammatory state that affects the heart can cause fibrosis of the atria. [...] This is typically due to sarcoidosis but may also be due to autoimmune disorders that create autoantibodies against myosin heavy chains. Mutation of the lamin AC gene is also associated with fibrosis of the atria that can lead to atrial fibrillation.|$|E
2500|$|NCRP Report No. 153 [...] notes that: “Denisova et al. exposed rats to 1.5 Gy of 1 GeV/u56Feions {{and tested}} their spatial memory in an eight-arm radial maze. Radiation {{exposure}} impaired the rats’ cognitive behavior, since they committed more errors than control rats in the radial maze and {{were unable to}} adopt a spatial strategy to solve the maze. To determine whether these findings related to brain-region specific alterations in sensitivity to oxidative stress, inflammation or neuronal plasticity, three regions of the brain, the striatum, hippocampus and frontal cortex that are linked to behavior, were isolated and compared to controls. Those that were irradiated were adversely affected as reflected through the levels of dichlorofluorescein, heat shock, and synaptic proteins (for example, synaptobrevin and synaptophysin). Changes in these factors consequently altered cellular signaling (for example, calciumdependent protein kinase C and protein kinase A). These changes in brain responses significantly correlated with working memory errors in the radial maze. The results show differential brain-region-specific sensitivity induced by 56Fe irradiation (...) [...] These findings {{are similar to those}} seen in aged rats, suggesting that increased oxidative stress and <b>inflammation</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> responsible for the induction of both radiation and age-related cognitive deficits.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Salmonella typhi {{has been}} linked to {{gallbladder}} cancer but <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> useful in delivering chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of melanoma, colon and bladder cancer. [...] Bacteria found in the gut <b>may</b> <b>be</b> related to colon cancer but <b>may</b> <b>be</b> more complicated due to the role of chemoprotective probiotic cancers. [...] Microorganisms and their metabolic byproducts, or impact of chronic <b>inflammation,</b> <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> linked to oral cancers.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} stages, signs of <b>inflammation</b> <b>may</b> not <b>be</b> {{apparent}} if the bacteria are {{deep within the}} tissue. If they are not deep, signs of inflammation, such as redness and swollen or hot skin, develop very quickly. Skin color may progress to violet, and blisters may form, with subsequent necrosis (death) of the subcutaneous tissues.|$|R
50|$|In {{pediatric}} patients varicella <b>inflammation</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{followed by}} vasculitis of intracranial vessels. This condition is called post varicella angiopathy {{and this may}} be responsible for arterial ischaemic strokes in children.|$|E

50|$|Phlegmon is a {{spreading}} diffuse inflammatory {{process with}} formation of purulent exudate (the suppuration of pus). This {{is the result}} of acute purulent <b>inflammation</b> which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> related to bacterial infection; however, the term 'phlegmon' (from Greek 'phlegmone', inflammation) mostly refers to a walled-off inflammatory mass without bacterial infection, one that <b>may</b> <b>be</b> palpable on physical examination.|$|R
50|$|Acute <b>inflammation</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{regarded}} as {{the first line of}} defense against injury. Acute inflammatory response requires constant stimulation to be sustained. Inflammatory mediators are short-lived and are quickly degraded in the tissue. Hence, acute inflammation begins to cease once the stimulus has been removed.|$|E

50|$|Posthitis {{can have}} {{infectious}} causes such as bacteria or fungi, or non-infectious causes such as contact dermatitis or psoriasis. The <b>inflammation</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> caused by irritants in the environment. Common causative organisms include candida, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. The cause must be properly diagnosed before a treatment can be prescribed. A common risk factor is diabetes.|$|E
5000|$|Signs of {{anterior}} uveitis include dilated ciliary vessels, {{presence of}} cells and flare in the anterior chamber, and keratic precipitates ("KP") on the posterior {{surface of the}} cornea. In severe <b>inflammation</b> there <b>may</b> <b>be</b> evidence of a hypopyon. Old episodes of uveitis are identified by pigment deposits on lens, KPs, and festooned pupil on dilation of pupil.|$|R
50|$|Regular {{monitoring}} {{is essential}} to achieve a good outcome. This is because {{even if there is}} no active <b>inflammation,</b> there <b>may</b> still <b>be</b> occult CNV which requires treatment to avoid suffering vision loss.|$|R
50|$|Irritation in the {{external}} ear canal due to <b>inflammation</b> or eczema <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a condition for which a conventional air conduction aid is not an appropriate treatment. Direct bone conduction <b>may</b> <b>be</b> an option.|$|R
50|$|Treatment {{is aimed}} at {{reducing}} itching and minimizing existing lesions because rubbing and scratching exacerbate LSC. The itching and <b>inflammation</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> treated with a lotions or steroid cream (such as triamcinolone or Betamethasone) applied to the affected area of the skin. Nighttime scratching can be reduced with sedatives and antihistamines. SSRIs can effectively reduce the scratching associated with obsessive psychosomatic behaviors.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} IC/BPS is unknown. While it can, {{it does not}} {{typically}} run in a family. The diagnosis is usually based on the symptoms after ruling out other conditions. Typically the urine culture is negative. Ulceration or <b>inflammation</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> seen on cystoscopy. Other conditions which can produce similar symptoms include urinary tract infection (UTI), overactive bladder, sexually transmitted infections, endometriosis, bladder cancer, and prostatitis.|$|E
5000|$|Often due to {{excessive}} use of the vocal folds such as excessive yelling, screaming, singing. Though this often results in damage to the outer layers of the vocal folds, the subsequent healing may lead {{to changes in the}} physiology of the folds. Another potential cause of <b>inflammation</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> overuse of the vocal cords.56789 Laryngeal trauma, including iatrogenic (caused by endotracheal intubation), can also result in inflammation of the vocal cords.|$|E
50|$|No {{treatment}} required. It {{is standard}} practice for men with infertility and category IV prostatitis {{to be given}} a trial of antibiotics and/or anti-inflammatories, although evidence of efficacy are weak. Since signs of asymptomatic prostatic <b>inflammation</b> <b>may</b> sometimes <b>be</b> associated with prostate cancer, this can be addressed by tests that assess the ratio of free-to-total PSA. The results of these tests were significantly different in prostate cancer and category IV prostatitis in one study.|$|R
5000|$|Treatments {{are given}} to manage the {{symptoms}} the patient is having. [...] In patients who are very sick, supportive treatment, such as mechanical ventilation, is equally important. Steroids are used to reduce brain swelling and <b>inflammation.</b> Sedatives <b>may</b> <b>be</b> needed for irritability or restlessness. Acetaminophen is used for fever and headache. Anticonvulsants are used to prevent seizures. If brain function is severely affected, interventions like physical therapy and speech therapy <b>may</b> <b>be</b> needed after the illness is controlled.|$|R
50|$|With {{posterior}} lens luxation, {{the lens}} falls {{back into the}} vitreous humour and lies {{on the floor of}} the eye. This type causes fewer problems than anterior lens luxation, although glaucoma or ocular <b>inflammation</b> <b>may</b> occur. Surgery <b>is</b> used to treat dogs with significant symptoms. Removal of the lens before it moves to the anterior chamber may prevent secondary glaucoma.|$|R
50|$|In the pulp, just as {{in other}} areas of the body, {{inflammation}} can be present. Inflammation of the pulp does not take place only when the bacteria in the decay have reached the pulp. Bacterial products may reach the pulp much earlier and begin the inflammatory response. The <b>inflammation</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> acute or chronic because just like other tissues in the body, the pulp will react to irritants with innate and/or adaptive immune responses.|$|E
50|$|Ulcerative {{dermatitis}} is a {{skin disorder}} in rodents associated with bacterial growth often initiated by self-trauma {{due to a}} possible allergic response. Although other organisms can be involved, bacteria culture frequently shows Staphylococcus aureus. Primarily found on the rib cage, neck, and shoulder, lesions are often irregular, circumscribed, and moist. Intense itching may lead to scratching which may aggravate and perpetuate the lesion. Destruction of the epidermis along with underlying pustules or abscesses, and granulomatous <b>inflammation,</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> present.|$|E
50|$|The <b>inflammation</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{caused by}} {{infection}} with viruses, bacteria, or other microorganisms, and less commonly by certain drugs. Meningitis can be life-threatening {{because of the}} inflammation's proximity to the brain and spinal cord; therefore, the condition is classified as a medical emergency. A lumbar puncture can diagnose or exclude meningitis. A needle is inserted into the spinal canal {{to collect a sample}} of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), that envelops the brain and spinal cord. The CSF is examined in a medical laboratory.|$|E
30|$|TiO 2 NP {{exposure}} {{resulted in}} cardiac inflammation coupling with pulmonary <b>inflammation,</b> which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> associated with immune dysfunction and imbalance of Th 1 -related cytokine expression and Th 2 -related cytokine expression in mouse heart. The finding exhibits new {{insight into the}} mechanisms of the TiO 2 NP-induced cardiovascular damage. However, the interaction of other Th 1 /Th 2 -related cytokines associated with TiO 2 NP-induced cardiovascular injury will be further investigated in future.|$|R
50|$|Characteristic of the myrtle family Myrtaceae, {{it is used}} to distill {{essential}} oil. It is {{the primary}} species for commercial production of tea tree oil (melaleuca oil), a topical antibacterial. Tea tree oil is commonly used as a topical antiseptic agent because of its antimicrobial properties, especially in the treatment of acne.
