5|$|There {{are three}} major {{conflicting}} factions {{present in the}} expansion, all residing in separate areas: the Harbormen of Far Harbor; the synth (synthetic humans) colony of Acadia; and the Church of the Children of Atom. The Harbormen of Far Harbor are led by the town leader, Captain Avery, and seek to reclaim The Island from the fog that has gradually driven {{them out of their}} homes. The Children of Atom live in an old nuclear submarine base called the Nucleus and are led by High Confessor Tektus. Tektus is a fanatical follower of the Church of Atom who seeks to disable or destroy the fog condensers. The refuge for the synth colony of Acadia is an abandoned research center at the top of The Island; the group are led by a mysterious prototype synth called DiMA. DiMA <b>is</b> <b>friendly</b> to both the Harbormen and the Children so long as Acadia remains autonomous and isolated {{from the rest of the}} world.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} model of two sociological phenomena: the tendencies to form groups and to favor others who are similar. Individuals divide society into friends and enemies. Individualspayo¤s depend on their own choices and on the choices of others. We assume di¤erent types of complementarities: Other things equal, each {{individual}} prefers to <b>be</b> <b>friendly</b> towards those who <b>are</b> <b>friendly</b> toward her (second-degree complementarity) and toward those who <b>are</b> <b>friendly</b> toward those [...] . who <b>are</b> <b>friendly</b> toward her (higher-degree complementarity). With second-degree complementarities, but no higher-degree externalities, individuals want to reciprocate friendship. Any additional amount of higher-degree complementarities pushes individuals to form groups. Next, we assume everybody may make mistakes that make him confuse individuals who are similar to each other. To minimize {{the cost of the}} mistakes, individuals want to keep their friends as di¤erent from their enemies as possible. Combined with group formation, individuals would like to <b>be</b> <b>friendly</b> toward others who are similar to them. Although individuals act as if they have preferences for similar others, in reality, their behavior is a best response to the equilibrium behavior of others. 1...|$|R
25|$|Those who breed Tollers for {{conformation}} shows {{consider the}} head (clean cut, slightly wedge-shaped) {{to be an}} important feature, and believe it should resemble that of a fox, and must never be blocky like that of a Golden Retriever.

The pigment on a toller's nose, lips and eye rims should match, and should be either black (which normally fades with age) or liver, blending into the coat. Lips fit fairly tightly around the mouth. The correct bite is a scissor bite, full dentition is required. Jaws are strong enough to carry a large bird, but Tollers must have a soft mouth too. Eyes are set well apart, almond shaped, medium-sized. Colour, amber to dark brown. Expression <b>is</b> <b>friendly,</b> alert and intelligent.|$|E
