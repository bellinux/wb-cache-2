40|$|SummaryThe current {{understanding}} of gene expression considers transcription and translation {{to be independent}} processes. Challenging this notion, we found that translation efficiency is determined during transcription elongation through the imprinting of mRNAs with Not 1, the central scaffold of the Ccr 4 -Not complex. We determined that another subunit of the complex, Not 5, defines Not 1 binding to specific mRNAs, particularly those produced from ribosomal protein genes. This imprinting mechanism specifically regulates ribosomal protein gene expression, which in turn determines the translational capacity of cells. We validate our model by SILAC and polysome profiling experiments. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that enhanced translation compensates for transcriptional <b>elongation</b> <b>stress.</b> Taken together, our data indicate {{that in addition to}} defining mRNA stability, components of the Ccr 4 -Not imprinting complex regulate RNA translatability, thus ensuring global gene expression homeostasis...|$|E
30|$|Silicon {{fractures}} under {{tensile stress}} at a certain load. In maximum tensile stress areas, silicon bond breakage appears to stem from tensile stress caused by diamond tip friction[27]. Therefore, the reaction of silicon may {{take place at the}} rear edge of the sliding contact area where the <b>elongation</b> <b>stress</b> is the highest. At loads of over 8 μN, protuberance height increased rapidly at 13.8 -GPa contact pressure and 1.8 -GPa tensile stress. Therefore, this protuberance-related phenomenon occurred through a mechanochemical reaction where adsorbates, such as water and oxygen, reacted with the silicon. The local destruction of interatomic bonds seems to increase at over 6 μN because of the concentrated stress and reaction of the newly formed surface with surrounding materials. This boundary load that increases and decreases the etching depth is nearly 6 μN. At this load, the contact pressure and tensile stress are 12.5 and 1.5  GPa, respectively.|$|E

A comprehensive understanding of the behavior and the morphology of this material are essential to propose an effective and feasible alternative to existing structural strengthening and retrofitting materials. This article presents the findings obtained from a series of experimental investigations to characterize the physical, mechanical, chemical and thermal behavior of eight types of palm-based polyurethane (PU) elastomers, which were synthesized from the reaction between palm kernel oil-based monoester polyol (PKO-p) and 4, 4 -diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) with polyethylene glycol (PEG) as the plasticizer via pre-polymerization. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy analysis was conducted to examine the functional groups in PU systems. Mechanical and physical behavior was studied with focus on <b>elongation,</b> <b>stresses,</b> modulus, energy absorption and dissipation, and load dispersion capacities by conducting hardness, tensile, flexural, Izod impact, and differential scanning calorimetry tests. Experimental results suggest that the palm-based PU has positive effects as a strengthening and retrofitting material against dynamic impulsive loadings both in terms of energy absorption and dissipation, and load dispersion. In addition, among all PUs with different plasticizer contents, PU 2 to PU 8 (which contain 2 % to 8 % (w/w) PEG with respect to PKO-p content) show the best correlation with mechanical response under quasi-static conditions focusing on energy absorption and dissipation and load dispersion characteristics...|$|R

40|$|High-speed running {{accounts}} {{for the majority of}} hamstring strains in many sports. The terminal swing phase {{is believed to be the}} most hazardous as the hamstrings are undergoing an active lengthening contraction in a long muscle length position. Prevention-based strength training mainly focuses on eccentric exercises. However, it appears crucial to integrate other parameters than the contraction type. Therefore, the aim of this study is to present a conceptual framework based on six key parameters (contraction type, load, range of motion, angular velocity, uni-/bilateral exercises, kinetic chain) for the hamstring's strength exercise for strain prevention. Based on the biomechanical parameters of sprinting, it is proposed to use high-load eccentric contractions. The movement should be performed at a slow to moderate angular velocity and focused at the knee joint, while the hip is kept in a large flexion position in order to reach a greater <b>elongation</b> <b>stress</b> of the hamstrings than in the terminal swing phase.

Here we demonstrated that modulation of miR- 200 c in breast cancer cells regulates cell migration, cell elongation, and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) -induced stress fiber formation by impacting the reorganization of cytoskeleton that is independent of the ZEB/E-cadherin axis. We identified FHOD 1 and PPM 1 F, direct regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, as novel targets of miR- 200 c. Remarkably, expression levels of FHOD 1 and PPM 1 F were inversely correlated with the level of miR- 200 c in breast cancer cell lines, breast cancer patient samples, and 58 cancer cell lines of various origins. Furthermore, individual knockdown/overexpression of these target genes phenocopied the effects of miR- 200 c overexpression/inhibition on cell <b>elongation,</b> <b>stress</b> fiber formation, migration, and invasion. Mechanistically, targeting of FHOD 1 by miR- 200 c resulted in decreased expression and transcriptional activity of serum response factor (SRF), mediated by interference with the translocation of the SRF coactivator mycocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTF-A). This finally led to downregulation of the expression and phosphorylation of the SRF target myosin light chain 2 (MLC 2) gene, required for stress fiber formation and contractility.

This paper investigates a method of anchoring CFRP laminates by utilisation of a mechanical chase cut into the concrete over the anchorage length. Experiments have shown this to be an effective way to improve the strength of the concrete substrate, resulting in higher CFRP bond strength and improvements in maximum <b>elongations,</b> bond <b>stress,</b> slip and load carrying capacity of the CFRP to concrete joint...|$|R
40|$|Rubber is {{commonly}} reinforced with colloidal aggregates of carbon or silica, whose structure has the scale invariance of a fractal object. Reinforced rubbers support large stresses, which often grow faster than linearly with the strain. We argue that under strong <b>elongation</b> the <b>stress</b> arises through lateral compression of the aggregates, {{driven by the}} large bulk modulus of the rubber. We derive a power-law relationship between <b>stress</b> and <b>elongation</b> λ when λ≫ 1. The predicted power p depends on the fractal dimension D and a second structural scaling exponent C. For diffusion-controlled aggregates this power p should lie beween 0. 9 and 1. 1  ; for reaction-controlled aggregates p should lie between 1. 8 and 2. 4. For uniaxial compression the analogous powers lie near 4. Practical rubbers filled with fractal aggregates should approach the conditions of validity for these scaling laws...|$|R

A comprehensive set of experiments on a two-dimensional constriction flow of a foam are described. Image analysis of the flow is used to ascertain bubble shape and flow dynamics. The bubble velocity, <b>elongation</b> (texture), <b>stress,</b> and deformation rate for a reference case are used to validate a quasistatic simulation. Changes to the constriction geometry, most especially in the rounding of the corners, {{have a significant effect on}} the response of the foam, captured in both experiment and simulation. On the other hand, foam properties such as bubble size have little C impact on the rheological behavior of the foam in the range considered here. Peer reviewe...|$|R
