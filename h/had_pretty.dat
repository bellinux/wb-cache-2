25|$|Logic {{suggests}} that Ward's fate {{was destined to}} be much the same. However, in Ward's case, his invention enabled him to turn his fate to his immense advantage. Family members state that the fact that the travels associated with the promotion of his invention took him away from the farm a lot was not something city-bred Ward considered to be disagreeable. In fact, his son David Bryant King <b>had</b> <b>pretty</b> much taken over operation of the farm {{by the time he reached}} eighteen. Leffler, after many years on his Hancock County farm, was finally able to move back to Springfield to help his father manage the family's considerable real estate holdings during his father's declining years. Like his brother, his son Edwin Askam King pretty much took over the operation of Grassland Farm. Although separated by distance, the brothers always remained very close, and they constantly worked together on the family's real estate undertakings in Springfield. Ironically, in the remarkably parallel lives of these two Springfield-reared farmers, their children were more farm people than they were.|$|E
500|$|Designer Steve Meretzky {{conceived}} Hodj 'n' Podj in {{the late}} 1980s, five or more years before the project began in 1994. His initial goal was to revive [...] "all those fun, simple games which <b>had</b> <b>pretty</b> much disappeared" [...] at the time. To increase its value, he believed it needed a structure that tied together its minigames; and this inspired its storyline and board game motif. Its story was {{in the style of}} Fractured Fairy Tales, from The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show. Meretzky later noted that other companies beat him to reviving these games in the years between Hodj 'n' Podjs conception and release, and saw success without any using overarching structures. However, he still felt [...] "very happy creatively" [...] with the final design of his project.|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone {{film critic}} Peter Travers rated the reissue 3.5 stars out of 4, {{explaining}} {{he found it}} [...] "pretty damn dazzling". He said, [...] "The 3D intensifies Titanic. You are there. Caught up like never before in an intimate epic that earns {{its place in the}} movie time capsule." [...] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman gave the film an A grade. He wrote, [...] "For once, the visuals in a 3-D movie don't look darkened or distracting. They look sensationally crisp and alive." [...] Richard Corliss of Time who was very critical in 1997 remained in the same mood, [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>pretty</b> much the same reaction: fitfully awed, mostly water-logged." [...] In regards to the 3D effects, he noted the [...] "careful conversion to 3D lends volume and impact to certain moments ... in separating the foreground and background of each scene, the converters have carved the visual field into discrete, not organic, levels." [...] Ann Hornaday for The Washington Post found herself asking [...] "whether the film's twin values of humanism and spectacle are enhanced by Cameron's 3-D conversion, and the answer to that is: They aren't." [...] She further added that the [...] "3-D conversion creates distance where there should be intimacy, not to mention odd moments in framing and composition." ...|$|E

The club management presented the key measures of the anti-violence which intended to pacify the Parc des Princes. By the name [...] "Tous PSG", many celebrities, such as former player Nicolas Anelka, attended and committed to the call of the club on the occasion of its 40 years. Paris Saint-Germain maintained the services of key players such as Claude Makélélé, Guillaume Hoarau, Stéphane Sessègnon and Mevlüt Erdinç, as well as adding Mathieu Bodmer and Nenê to their player pool. Robin Leproux <b>had</b> <b>pretty</b> high ambitions and declared that PSG was on the course to become more competitive.

Mathieu also published her autobiography with co-author [...] The title is Oui Je Crois [...] "Yes, I Believe" [...] which is taken from the lyrics of Mon crédo, her first recording. The book {{was seen as a}} final chapter in her career. The French public <b>had</b> <b>pretty</b> much disowned her, as a conservative relic. She was considered a pre-revolution (1968) Gaullist figurehead, and hated by the left. Stark was also exhausted and overweight by this time. Pierre Delanoë wrote a passionate song about Joan of Arc in [...] for Mireille. The final lyric: [...] "When I think of all I have given France... and she has forgotten me" [...] was truly how the singer felt as she was made a caricature by the Communists in power. She used her fists in punching the air while singing the song.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the extreme}} {{empiricism}} of the neopositivists—at least before the 1930s—any genuinely synthetic assertion must be reducible to an ultimate assertion (or set of ultimate assertions) that expresses direct observations or perceptions. In later years, Carnap and Neurath abandoned {{this sort of}} phenomenalism {{in favor of a}} rational reconstruction of knowledge into the language of an objective spatio-temporal physics. [...] That is, instead of translating sentences about physical objects into sense-data, such sentences were to be translated into so-called protocol sentences, for example, [...] "X at location Y and at time T observes such and such." [...] The central theses of logical positivism (verificationism, the analytic-synthetic distinction, reductionism, etc.) came under sharp attack after World War II by thinkers such as Nelson Goodman, W.V. Quine, Hilary Putnam, Karl Popper, and Richard Rorty. [...] By the late 1960s, it had become evident to most philosophers that the movement <b>had</b> <b>pretty</b> much run its course, though its influence is still significant [...] among contemporary analytic philosophers such as Michael Dummett and other anti-realists.|$|E
2500|$|The band took {{a simpler}} {{approach}} {{partly because the}} members felt the songs on ...And Justice for All were too long and complex. Hetfield said that radio airplay was not their intention, but because they felt [...] "we <b>had</b> <b>pretty</b> much done the longer song format to death," [...] and considered a good change doing songs with just two riffs and [...] "only taking two minutes to get the point across". Ulrich added that the band was feeling a musical insecurity — [...] "We felt inadequate as musicians and as songwriters, That made us go too far, around Master of Puppets and Justice, {{in the direction of}} trying to prove ourselves. 'We'll do all this weird-ass shit sideways to prove that we are capable musicians and songwriters'" [...] – and Hetfield added he wanted to avoid getting stale: [...] "Sitting there and worrying about whether people are going to like the album, therefore we have to write a certain kind of song — you just end up writing for someone else. Everyone's different. If everyone was the same, it would be boring as shit." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Bird was delighted with the victory, calling his achievement [...] "incredible" [...] and congratulated Formula E for organising the ePrix: [...] "I can imagine how difficult it was, but it’s been an amazing week so far. We <b>had</b> <b>pretty</b> good speed today." [...] He said that the Berlin races were [...] "a turning point" [...] for his team {{as they had been}} extensively educated on their performance and praised his teammate Lynn for taking the pole position. Vergne was pleased to finish in second place but claimed his getaway off the grid prevented him from winning the race as there was a large amount of dirt off the racing line which caused him to lose positions. However, he was aware he could reclaim ground in the opening phase of the event, and increased his pace to conserve more electrical energy than Bird and felt the latter deserved the victory. Sarrazin said that he felt [...] "very good" [...] to secure a third-place finish, and despite making a small error in qualifying, he was aware that his car was good but felt [...] "lucky" [...] because of Abt's final lap problem.|$|E

2500|$|Colvin's first {{involvement}} with international cricket came in August 2005, when the England team {{was preparing to}} face the Australian women's international team at the Hove County Cricket Ground. She was invited to bowl against the English team in the nets to give them practice against a left-arm spinner, who the Australian team was fielding {{in the form of}} Shelley Nitschke. After the practice session, Colvin was asked to be available for the four-day [...] by team coach Richard Bates. Team captain Clare Connor admitted that her inclusion was [...] "pure hunch", believing that the dry, dusty wicket would be favourable to spin bowling. Bates explained to The Times that [...] "the pitch [...] a little worn, and we felt that Holly could help us exploit it". Colvin made her England debut on 9 August 2005, becoming at 15 years and 336 days the youngest cricketer (of either sex) to play Test cricket for England. She took three wickets in her inaugural game, dismissing Kate Blackwell and Julia Price in two consecutive balls and nearly taking Julie Hayes for a hat-trick. Reminiscing over the experience in February 2008, Colvin remarked that [...] "I think I was fortunate... I had no idea who I was playing against – all these big names that were coming up against me and I <b>had</b> <b>pretty</b> much no idea". She described her near-hat-trick as a [...] "pretty special [...] ".|$|E
