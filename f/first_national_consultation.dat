5000|$|IEAB {{argues that}} [...] "everyone baptized, {{faithful}} and obedient to God, {{regardless of their}} sexual orientation, are full members of the Body of Christ, the Church". According to Cardoso, the Church has welcomed gay people as members since 1998. In 1997, the Bishops of IEAB signed a document saying that [...] "sexuality is a gift from God, and sexual intercourse, when practiced {{in a context of}} love and mutual respect, should not only be accepted but also considered as one of the good things that God has created". In 2001, IEAB conducted the <b>first</b> <b>national</b> <b>consultation</b> on human sexuality, when its members decided to reject [...] "the principle of exclusion implicit in the ethics of sin and uncleanness" [...] and declare inclusiveness as an [...] "essence of the ministry of Jesus". On 12 May 2011, IEAB released a statement declaring its support for the Supreme Federal Court decision to recognize same-sex unions in Brazil. More recently, the Presiding Bishop issued a letter in support of the Episcopal Church's decision to adopt a non-gender marriage stance and stating that he wanted his church to do the same soon. The Church has declared its support for the ordination of openly gay clergy and has offered a service of blessing for same-sex marriages. According to Santos, the political progressivism of IEAB's religious leaders is the reflex of their broad theological education.|$|E
40|$|This {{review was}} Australia 2 ̆ 7 s <b>first</b> <b>national</b> <b>consultation</b> {{with people with}} disability, their {{families}} and service providers. Overview For much of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s history there was no national program of disability service provision. This changed {{with the election of}} the Whitlam government, which passed the Handicapped Program Assistance Act 1974, funding non-government organisations to provide housing or care to disabled people. In 1983, the Hawke Government instituted a review of programs developed under this Act. For the first time, the review involved people with disabilities, and their families, as part of an extensive consultation process. The report resulted in the replacement of the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act 1974 (HPAA), with the Disability Services Act 1986. The new Act covered a much broader range of services than had the HPAA, including: 	 accommodation support 	 respite care 	 supported employment 	 competitive employment, training and placement 	 advisory and information services 	 individual assessment and program planning 	 the CRS (formerly administered under the Social Security Act). The Disability Services Act 1986 also provided funding for States, recognising that they were involved involved in such service provision. Australia did not again see a report recommending such wide-ranging changes in disability service provision until the release of the Productivity Commission’s Interim Report on Disability in August 2011, which helped spur the establishment of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Report 2 ̆ 7 s introduction This report outlines the major issues and options raised during the Handicapped Programs Review (HPR) and gives an indication of the broad directions in which the Commonwealth Government will be developing its programs and services in the immediate and longer term future. The chapters of the report have been grouped into the following broad sections: • A new direction • Focus on functional areas • Focus on community • Special considerations • Organisation and administration for the future The review process adopted was quite unlike most public inquiries undertaken by the Commonwealth Government and it is important to describe that process first. The major focus of the Review was to establish appropriate long term goals and develop program options based on the aspirations of consumers. This consumer outcomes approach is a most important development and will form the basis of new programs for people with disabilities to be established by the Commonwealth. The replacement of the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act 1974 (HPAA), by the proposed Disability Services Legislation {{will be one of the}} more immediate outcomes of the Review. This legislation will be designed to be more flexible than the current Act, involve a number of funding innovations and provide for better co-ordination of services than currently exists. The terms of reference of the Review, while focusing on Commonwealth programs of relevance to disabled people, were quite broad and consequently attracted comment on an extensive range of issues. It is not practical to attempt to list all such issues in a report of this nature and hence only the main themes are covered here. Other reports will be available later giving further details on some of the matters referred to in this report. Throughout the report selected quotes from people participating in the consultation or who wrote to the Review have been used as illustration. The cartoons are the work of Simon Kneebone. In Australia at the present time, the terms disability and disabled are more generally acceptable to the people involved than are the terms handicap and handicapped. Accordingly, the former are the terms used in this report. A number of abbreviations have also been used in this report. These are listed in Attachment F. Because of the nature of the HPR, the report concentrates on comments and opinions and the development of options for im provement in programs and services. Such a review is, of course, not a detailed scientific or statistical investigation but it does provide for a clear reflection of cu rrent community views. The report 2 ̆ 7 s conclusion (Chapter 29) is followed by a summary of the recommendations (Chapter 30) designed to give effect to the new directions to be taken by the Commonwealth Government.   [...] - Part of the Policy History Collection.

The evaluation was conducted on behalf of the King Baudouin Foundation, Brussels. Its major objective was to review the methodological concept and design, but also the organisational and process-related qualities of the European Citizens’ Consultations (ECC) project. The evaluation especially focused on the conditions, the promoting and impeding factors for initiating, conducting and sustaining a constructive dialogue among citizens from all EU member countries. The evaluation was mainly based on four criteria: fairness, competence, efficiency and transparency. The ECC dialogue process (www. european-citizens-consultations. eu) was initiated by the Agenda-Setting Event in Brussels in October 2006 with 200 citizens from all EU countries. In February and March 2007, <b>national</b> <b>consultation</b> events took place in each member state of the European Union. The purpose of the <b>national</b> <b>consultation</b> processes was to further elaborate the topics that were developed and selected during the Agenda-Setting Event. The final report was adopted in May 2007 during the final event in Brussels (Synthesis Event) by citizens from all European countries. The evaluation team of DIALOGIK used three main methods for data input and processing: ·Direct observations during all events at European level and 12 selected <b>national</b> <b>consultation</b> events (documentation of general and specific features of the dialogue process by using a pre-structured observation sheet) ·Personal/telephone interviews with key actors (coordinators, facilitators, stakeholders and involved citizens) as well as ·Written surveys among the participants during all events at European level and the selected <b>national</b> <b>consultations</b> to elicit participants’ perceptions and assessments regarding the process and the results developed. In addition, the evaluation team analysed the project’s website and other documents of the ECC-project as well as “external” websites.

40|$|From 1966, the Belgian State {{had become}} more and more {{involved}} in elaborating Belgian steel policy. This industry were poorly equipped to deal with the growing competition of the new steel producers in a period (1966 - 1975) marked by a strong growth in demand for steel followed by an unprecedented market collapse. It ‘s in this context that the <b>first</b> <b>national</b> institution for <b>consultation</b> and cooperation had been created in 1967. It was a rather original and innovative way to elaborate a more coordinated and cooperative steel policy in Belgium. Leaded by a major figure of the Belgian political and socio-economic « landerneau », André Oleffe, the CCPS had to managed the necessary sort out of the steel sector by the way of a tripartite consultations process between the governement, the sector’employers and trade unions. The challenge Andre Oleffe as chairman of the CCPS had to face was not the most easy one. While he played a central and very active role in this attempt to bring some order to the chaos of an industry more preoccupied with direct, short term profits than a long-term industrial policy, the institutional basis for tripartite cooperation had become inoperative from 1972. But the holding companies were {{become more and more}} dependent on it for obtaining State subsidies for their still firms.
