40|$|The Automatic Test Equipment {{industry}} {{must maintain}} a tester accuracy of roughly one tenth the pulsewidth {{of the device}} under test (DUT). Funneling {{a vast number of}} electrical signals into a very tiny area to contact the DUT while still maintaining good signal fidelity is a problem not only in the ATE industry, but also for personal computers, network servers and supercomputers. As the speed of processors increase, ATE companies must find new ways to achieve the required accuracy. A solution to this problem is investigated whereby a large number of semi-rigid coaxial wires are routed in 3 D space from a low-density array (the tester side) to a high-density array (the DUT side). The three dimensional paths are subject to bend constraints and cannot intersect with any other paths. A software program has been written and tested that is able to find solutions to this 3 D routing problem for many test cases. For relatively simple test cases with less than 15 wires, solutions can typically be found in under a minute. Once the geometries of the paths are determined, a block is made with 3 D tunnels transversing through it. This part is created using a 3 D additive process (e. g. stereolithography), and the coaxial wires are pushed into each tunnel. The maximum force used to insert a wire into a tunnel is limited by the force at which buckling occurs. Uncontrolled buckling of the coaxial wire will compromise electrical signal fidelity or cause opens and must therefore be prevented. To this end, models have been developed to predict the force required to push wires into a predetermined path. Relatively good experimental agreement, within 20 % in many cases, was achieved for paths with radii of curvature to wire diameter ratios between 200 : 1 and 10 : 1. A perfectly elastic beam model is developed as well as an elastic-plastic beam model. (cont.) Additional models are developed which account for the friction and the effect of clearance between the tunnel and the beam. The model is used to guide the routing software such that no path is created that cannot have a wire inserted into it. The solution proposed provides an excellent alternative to a printed circuit board for high speed electrical signals. The general method of using additive manufacturing to create tunnels to <b>guide</b> <b>signal</b> opens up many possibilities for not just coaxial cables, but fluid piping, optical fibers and solid wires. The solution has many further advantages and applications that are reviewed briefly but have not been investigated. by Keith J. Breinlinger. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Many {{problems}} in image processing and computer vision (e. g. colorization, style transfer) can be posed as 'manipulating' an input image into a corresponding output image given a user-specified <b>guiding</b> <b>signal.</b> A holy-grail solution towards generic image manipulation {{should be able}} to efficiently alter an input image with any personalized signals (even signals unseen during training), such as diverse paintings and arbitrary descriptive attributes. However, existing methods are either inefficient to simultaneously process multiple signals (let alone generalize to unseen signals), or unable to handle signals from other modalities. In this paper, we make the first attempt to address the zero-shot image manipulation task. We cast this problem as manipulating an input image according to a parametric model whose key parameters can be conditionally generated from any <b>guiding</b> <b>signal</b> (even unseen ones). To this end, we propose the Zero-shot Manipulation Net (ZM-Net), a fully-differentiable architecture that jointly optimizes an image-transformation network (TNet) and a parameter network (PNet). The PNet learns to generate key transformation parameters for the TNet given any <b>guiding</b> <b>signal</b> while the TNet performs fast zero-shot image manipulation according to both signal-dependent parameters from the PNet and signal-invariant parameters from the TNet itself. Extensive experiments show that our ZM-Net can perform high-quality image manipulation conditioned on different forms of <b>guiding</b> <b>signals</b> (e. g. style images and attributes) in real-time (tens of milliseconds per image) even for unseen signals. Moreover, a large-scale style dataset with over 20, 000 style images is also constructed to promote further research...|$|R

This work was devoted to the debonding damage detection of lap splice joints in carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) structures, which is based on <b>guided</b> ultrasonic wave <b>signals</b> captured by using fiber optic Doppler (FOD) sensor with spiral shape. Interferometers based on two types of laser sources, namely the He-Ne laser and the infrared semiconductor laser, are proposed and compared in this study for the purpose of measuring Doppler frequency shift of the FOD sensor.

The FOD sensors are subsequently used to detect the guided ultrasonic waves propagating in the CFRP structures. By taking advantage of signal processing approaches, features of the <b>guided</b> wave <b>signals</b> can be revealed.

40|$|A Bayesian {{approach}} is proposed to quantitatively identify damages in beam-like structures using experimentally measured <b>guided</b> wave <b>signals.</b> The proposed methodology treats the damage location, length and depth as unknown parameters. Damage identification {{is achieved by}} solving an optimization problem, in which a hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm is applied to maximize the probability density function of a damage scenario conditional on the measured <b>guided</b> wave <b>signals.</b> Signal envelopes extracted by the Hilbert transform are proposed to minimize {{the complexity of the}} optimization problem in order to enhance the robustness and computational efficiency of the damage identification. One of the advantages of the proposed methodology is that instead of only pinpointing the multivariate damage characteristics, the uncertainty associated with the damage identification results is also quantified. This outcome provides essential information for making decisions about the remedial work necessary to repair structural damage. The experimental data consist of <b>guided</b> wave <b>signals</b> measured at a single location of the beams.

40|$|Guided wave sensors {{are widely}} used {{in a number of}} {{industries}} and have found particular application in {{the oil and gas industry}} for the inspection of pipework. Traditionally this type of sensor was used for one-off inspections, but in recent years there has been a move towards permanent installation of the sensor. This has enabled highly repeatable readings of the same section of pipe, potentially allowing improvements in defect detection and classification. This paper proposes a novel approach using independent component analysis to decompose repeat <b>guided</b> wave <b>signals</b> into constituent independent components. This separates the defect from coherent noise caused by changing environmental conditions, improving detectability. This paper demonstrates independent component analysis applied to <b>guided</b> wave <b>signals</b> from a range of industrial inspection scenarios. The analysis is performed on test data from pipe loops that have been subject to multiple temperature cycles both in undamaged and damaged states. In addition to processing data from experimental damaged conditions, simulated damage signals have been added to “undamaged” experimental data, so enabling multiple different damage scenarios to be investigated.

Here, we examined the orientation of cultured human melanocytes exposed to grooved topographies. To predict the cells' orientation response, we describe the cell behavior with an automatic controller model. The predicted dependence of the cell response to height and spatial frequency of the grooves is obtained by considering the symmetry of the system (cell + substrate). One basic result is that the automatic controller responds to the square of the product of groove height and spatial frequency or to the aspect ratio for symmetric grooves. This theoretical prediction was verified by the experiments, in which melanocytes were exposed to microfabricated poly(dimethylsiloxane) substrates having parallel rectangular grooves of heights (h) between 25 and 200 nm and spatial frequencies (L) between 100 and 500 mm− 1.

The term coaxial comes from the inner conductor and the outer shield sharing the same geometric axis. Coaxial cables are often used as a transmission line for radio frequency signals. In a hypothetical ideal coaxial cable the electromagnetic field carrying the signal exists only in the space between the inner and outer conductors.

40|$|Multiple wave modes often {{exist in}} the {{ultrasonic}} guided waves simultaneously, and these modes are dispersive, so the <b>guided</b> wave <b>signals</b> are very complex, even for the relatively simple situation of a narrowband excitation. The <b>guided</b> wave <b>signals</b> are {{even more difficult to}} analyze for broadband excitations. Time-frequency representations are appropriate for the analysis of the <b>guided</b> wave <b>signals</b> considering their non-stationary and transient nature. As a post-processing tool, the squeezed wavelet transform is studied for broadband Lamb wave mode identification in this work. The influence of the parameters of the Gabor mother wavelet on the performance of the transform is analyzed in details. It is found that the product of the σ parameter of the used Gauss function and the center frequency ω 0 of the wavelet decides the overall time and frequency resolutions, so a proper selection of the value of this product σω 0 is crucial for the squeezed wavelet transform. The squeezed wavelet transform is first applied to the analysis of a synthesized signal for verification. Then it’s applied for mode identification of a simulated broadband Lamb wave signal. By traversing the value of σω 0, a roughly optimum analysis performance is achieved for the squeezed wavelet transform for the case of σω 0 = 11, where the modes are well separated and the interferences between the modes are minimal. It’s proved that as an alternative tool, the squeezed wavelet transform could be used for the analysis of a broadband Lamb wave signal.

40|$|Ultrasonic {{guided wave}} is an {{effective}} tool for structural health monitoring of structures for detecting defects. In practice, <b>guided</b> wave <b>signals</b> are dispersive and contain multiple modes and noise. In the presence of overlapped wave-packets/modes and noise together with dispersion, extracting meaningful information from these signals is a challenging task. Handling such challenge requires an advanced signal processing tool. The {{aim of this study}} is to develop an effective and robust signal processing tool to deal with the complexity of <b>guided</b> wave <b>signals</b> for non-destructive testing (NDT) purpose. To achieve this goal, Sparse Representation with Dispersion Based Matching Pursuit (SDMP) is proposed. Addressing the three abovementioned facts that complicate signal interpretation, SDMP separates overlapped modes and demonstrates good performance against noise with maximum sparsity. With the dispersion taken into account, an overc-omplete and redundant dictionary of basic atoms based on a narrowband excitation signal is designed. As Finite Element Method (FEM) was used to predict the form of wave packets propagating along structures, these atoms have the maximum resemblance with real <b>guided</b> wave <b>signals.</b> SDMP operates in two stages. In the first stage, similar to Matching Pursuit (MP), the approximation improves by adding, a single atom to the solution set at each iteration. However, atom selection criterion of SDMP utilizes the time localization of guided wave reflections that makes a portion of overlapped wave-packets to be composed mainly of a single echo. In the second stage of the algorithm, the selected atoms that have frequency inconsistency with the excitation signal are discarded. This increases the sparsity of the final representation. Meanwhile, leading to accurate approximation, as discarded atoms are not representing guided wave reflections, it simplifies extracting physical meanings for defect detection purpose. To verify the effectiveness of SDMP for damage detection results from numerical simulations and experiments on steel pipes are presented...|$|R

However, any small degree of complexity in the geometry such as contacting with other materials may cause an extra amount of complication {{in the interpretation of}} <b>guided</b> wave <b>signals.</b> The problem deepens if defects have irregular shapes such as natural corrosion. Signal processing techniques that have been proposed for guided wave signals’ analysis are generally good for simple signals obtained in a highly controlled experimental environment. In fact, <b>guided</b> wave <b>signals</b> in a real situation such as the existence of natural corrosion in wall-covered pipes are much more complicated. Considering pipes in residential buildings that pass through concrete walls, in this paper we introduced Smooth Empirical Mode Decomposition (SEMD) to efficiently separate overlapped guided waves. As empirical mode decomposition (EMD) which is a good candidate for analyzing non-stationary signals, suffers from some shortcomings, wavelet transform was adopted in the sifting stage of EMD to improve its outcome in SEMD. However, selection of mother wavelet that suits best for our purpose plays an important role. Since in guided wave inspection, the incident waves are well known and are usually tone-burst signals, we tailored a complex tone-burst signal to be used as our mother wavelet. In the sifting stage of EMD, wavelet de-noising was applied to eliminate unwanted frequency components from each IMF. SEMD greatly enhances the performance of EMD in guided wave analysis for highly contaminated signals.
