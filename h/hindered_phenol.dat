30|$|The color {{formation}} in neat and stabilized samples after γ-serialization is also represented {{in terms of}} delta yellowness index (d YI) in Figs.  1 and 2. The effect addition of oligomeric HAS, tert-HAS and organo-phosphite to <b>hindered</b> <b>phenol</b> {{can be seen in}} Fig.  2 where yellowness index reduced. It can be seen that the combination of <b>hindered</b> <b>phenol</b> with other stabilizers highly prevent the discoloration. For example, the combination of <b>hindered</b> <b>phenol</b> with oligomeric HAS, tert-HAS and organo-phosphite (i.e. CTXS) drastically reduces the yellowness index from 3.1 to 0.5. It can be seen that the addition of organo-phosphite (S) to (CX) reduced the YI values from 1.9 to 1.1, while addition of tert-HAS (T) to (CX) did not reduce the yellowness index. The significant reduction in yellowing after addition organo-phosphite (S) to CX and CTX {{can be attributed to the}} fact that organo-phosphite decomposes the hydroperoxides to reduce further oxidation and their reaction with oxidized products of <b>hindered</b> <b>phenol,</b> i.e. highly colored quinonoids which are transformed into colorless benzenoid forms [20, 21, 22, 34]. In contrast to tensile property, where the combination of oligomeric HAS stabilizer ‘C’ and <b>hindered</b> <b>phenol</b> ‘X’ (i.e. CX) exhibited the antagonistic effect, the incorporation of oligomeric HAS stabilizer into <b>hindered</b> <b>phenol</b> ‘X’ significantly diminished the YI from 3.1 to 1.8. As explained [20, 21, 22], the reduction in YI after combination oligomeric HAS with <b>hindered</b> <b>phenol</b> may be due to the radical scavenging effect of oligomeric HAS stabilizer. The efficiency of phenolic stabilizer systems for protection against yellowing is as follows: CTXS > CXS > CX > CTX > X. This trend is similar to that observed for iPP and EP, but the magnitude of discoloration was lower in all samples of LDPE than that of iPP and EP due to the high durability of LDPE against γ-radiation. The results clearly indicate that the combination of <b>hindered</b> <b>phenol</b> with different stabilizers highly prevent discoloration. This could be explained by the presence of various stabilizers which prevent the polymer degradation via different protection mechanisms at different stages synergistically.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Food {{is widely}} {{packaged}} with plastic materials to prevent microbial contamination and spoilage. Ionizing radiation {{is widely used}} to sterilize the food-packaging materials. Sterilization by γ-radiation causes degradation such as embrittlement, stiffening, softening, discoloration, odour generation, and decrease in molecular weight. Many antioxidants can prevent γ-degradation {{but most of them}} are toxic. The migration of antioxidants to its environment gives rise to major concerns in case of food packaging plastics. In this attempt, we have aimed to utilize synergistic mixtures of stabilizers which are approved for food-contact applications. Ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymer has been melt-mixed with hindered amine stabilizers (HAS), phenolic antioxidants and organo-phosphites (hydroperoxide decomposer). Results were discussed by comparing the stabilizing efficiency of mixtures with and without phenol system. Among phenol containing systems where we mostly observed discoloration due to the oxidation of <b>hindered</b> <b>phenol,</b> the combination of secondary HAS, tertiary HAS, organo-phosphite and <b>hindered</b> <b>phenol</b> exhibited improved stabilization efficiency than single or binary additive systems.

The effect of the different antioxidants, when used separately and in combination, was investigated by characterising the changes in the polymer's rheological behaviour, colour formation and structural changes based on unsaturated groups and carbonyl content during five multi-pass extrusions. The results showed that all stabilisation systems examined offered higher efficiency in the metallocene polymers compared to the Zeigler. The effect of the extent of SCB in the metallocene polymers on the stabilising efficacy of the antioxidant systems was also examined, and it was shown that it had a significant effect, with both single and combinations of antioxidants giving higher efficiency in the m-LLDPE polymer containing higher extent of SCB. The presence of the lactone HP 136 in mixtures containing hindered phenol–phosphite antioxidant systems gave a higher melt stabilisation efficiency than in its absence and this has been attributed to a co-operative antioxidant reaction steps that take place between the antioxidants resulting in the possible regeneration of the lactone antioxidant through a redox reaction.

40|$|Antioxidant norbornene-based {{monomers}} bearing biobased sterically <b>hindered</b> <b>phenols</b> (SHP) —NDF (norbornene dihydroferulate) and NDS (norbornene dihydrosinapate) —have {{been successfully}} prepared through biocatalysis from naturally occurring ferulic and sinapic acids, respectively, in presence of Candida antarctica Lipase B (Cal-B). The ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of these monomers was investigated according to ruthenium catalyst type (GI) vs. (HGII) and monomer to catalyst molar ratio ([M]/[C]). The co-polymerization of antioxidant functionalized monomer (NDF or NDS) and non-active norbornene (N) {{has also been}} performed in order to adjust the number of SHP groups present per weight unit and tune the antioxidant activity of the copolymers. The polydispersity of the resulting copolymers was readily improved by a simple acetone wash to provide antioxidant polymers with well-defined structures. After hydrogenation with p-toluenesulfonylhydrazine (p-TSH), the radical scavenging ability of the resulting saturated polymers was evaluated using α,α-diphenyl-β-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) analysis. Results demonstrated that polymers bearing sinapic acid SHP exhibited higher antiradical activity than the polymer bearing ferulic acid SHP. In addition it was also shown {{that only a small}} SHP content was needed in the copolymers to exhibit a potent antioxidant activity...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen bond {{assisted}} alkylation of phenols {{is compared}} with the classical base assisted reactions. The influence of solvents on the fluoride assisted reactions is discussed,· with emphasis on the localization of hydrogen bond charge density. Polar aprotic solvents such as DMF favour a-alkylation, and nonpolar aprotic solvents such as toluene favourC-alkylation of phenol. For more reactive and soluble fluorides, such as tetrabu~ylammoniumfluoride, the polar aprotic solvent favours a-alkylation and nonpolar aprotic solvent favours fluorination. Freeze-dried potassium fluoride is a better catalytic agent in hydrogen bond assisted alkylation reactions of phenol than the oven-dried fluoride. The presence {{of water in the}} alkylation reactions reduces the expected yield drastically. The tolerance of the reaction to water has also been studied. The use ofa phase transfer catalyst such as tetrabutylammonium bromide in the alkylation reactions of phenol in the presence of potassium fluoride is very effective under anhydrous conditions. Sterically <b>hindered</b> <b>phenols</b> such as 2, 6 -ditertiarybutyl- 4 -methyl phenol could not be alkylated even by using the more reactive fluorides, such as tetrabutylammonium fluoride in either polar or nonpolar aprotic solvents. Attempts were also made to alkylate phenols in the presence of triphenylphosphine oxide...|$|R
