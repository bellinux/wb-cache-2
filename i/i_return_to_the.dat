500|$|Late in life, when {{he looked}} back at his years acting in Adler and Goldfaden's companies, Adler saw it as merely the [...] "childhood" [...] of his career. He {{describes}} his thoughts toward the end of this period, [...] "For three years I had wandered in the cave of the Witch in the clown's rags of Shmendrick and what did I really know of my trade?... If someday <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Yiddish theater, let me at least not be so ignorant." ...|$|E
60|$|Hearing this, I {{wait to hear}} no more. <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sitting-room (by way of the corridor) {{and resume}} my place at the table.|$|E
60|$|However, I shall {{endeavour}} {{to see you}} somewhere, {{and make}} my bow with decorum before <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ottomans, I believe I shall turn Mussulman in the end.|$|E
60|$|His unwonted wordiness inspirited me. <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> charge.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hotel, <b>to</b> make {{inquiries}} about conveyances.|$|R
60|$|The servant {{answered}} <b>the</b> bell, as <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sitting-room.|$|R
60|$|And when <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Lily, {{she tells}} me that she cannot trust me. She has watched me with those others. She knows me for a gad-about. Her gentle face is full of pain.|$|E
6000|$|... "Will ye not greet me, {{children}} of my children? [...] Have ye forgotten {{the promise of}} the dead? [...] Shall <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dream-land whence I wander? [...] Will ye refuse me, the Mother of the Snake?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot conceal from myself," [...] {{said the}} doctor, rising, and hesitating a little, [...] "that I am intruding on you. But I am {{compelled}} to beg your indulgence if <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> subject of Mr. Armadale." ...|$|E
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hall, {{carrying}} my bag, I found Audrey there.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> waiting-room, not forgetting {{of course}} <b>to</b> close <b>the</b> door of communication.|$|R
60|$|After {{half an hour}} of aimless {{wandering}} in <b>the</b> valley, <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rectory.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, cousin John, I will bandy {{words with}} you no longer; {{for the last}} twelve months you have done little else than try to lessen the joyful anticipations with which <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> home of my childhood." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ovid {{acknowledged}} the hint with a neatness of retort almost worthy of his mother. [...] "You {{have your own}} merciful disposition to blame, if <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> subject," [...] he replied. [...] "My cousin cannot forget your kindness to the monkey." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} {{impossible}} even for me. Poyor is the only guide, and when he has done his work you sail on the steamer, while he and <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> little hut, there to wait for another opportunity of getting inside the Silver City." ...|$|E
60|$|Having {{seen him}} safely stowed below deck <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> trail {{for a final}} word with Burton.|$|R
60|$|It {{was useless}} <b>to</b> pursue <b>the</b> question, knowing {{no more than}} I knew now. <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> book-case.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> drawing-room {{where the}} others were still {{discussing}} the remarkable performance of the two native conjurers.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know not," [...] he answered, [...] "we {{have found}} nothing of her. Give me brandy and another horse, {{for the sun}} rises, and <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> search. The tide is down, perhaps we shall {{discover}} her among the rocks," [...] and he groaned and entered the house with me.|$|E
60|$|I have ceased exercising. As long as I {{remain in}} the room, the {{hallucination}} does not bother me. But when <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> room after an absence, he is always there, sitting at the desk, writing. Yet I dare not confide in a physician. I must fight this out by myself.|$|E
60|$|Here {{the girl}} importuned her {{again with the}} utmost earnestness, and cried bitterly, insomuch that my poor Quaker was {{softened}} with it, and began to persuade me to consider of it, and, if it might consist with my affairs, to see her, and hear {{what she had to}} say; but this was afterwards. <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> discourse.|$|E
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pilot house <b>to</b> report <b>the</b> {{good news}} <b>to</b> my {{companion}} {{he handed me}} a paper.|$|R
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> drawing-room, Aunt Emma {{sat there}} on the sofa, crying silently, the very picture of misery.|$|R
60|$|The {{poor man}} spoke honestly. I {{was ashamed of}} having doubted him. <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> subject of the knife.|$|R
60|$|I might relate {{other things}} which befell {{me during the}} six weeks and more that I {{remained}} in Liverpool, often visiting the cellars, sinks, and hovels of the wretched lanes and courts near the river. But to tell of them, would only be to tell over again the story just told; so <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> docks.|$|E
60|$|Sad as this estrangement is, {{there is}} one consolation--so far as I am concerned, it will not last. My father and I are sure, sooner or later, {{to come to an}} {{understanding}} together. When <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rectory, I shall make my peace with him, and we shall get on again as smoothly as ever.|$|E
6000|$|COUNT. [...] What? my time? Is it my time? Well, I {{can give}} my time To him {{that is a}} part of you, your son. Shall <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> castle with you? Shall I Sit by him, read to him, tell him my tales, Sing him my songs? You know that I can touch The ghittern to some purpose.|$|E
60|$|We {{watched the}} coach {{out of sight}} up the busy street, and then Mr. Canning and <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> office.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> {{next day}} <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hall, and asking once more <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> housekeeper, I communicated to her my plan.|$|R
50|$|In 1813, his son, King William <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands {{and became}} the first Dutch monarch from the House of Orange.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Only on one {{condition}} could <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Holt,' said Lucilla, resolutely. 'If Honor would freely offer to receive your son, I {{would go to}} take care of him. Except for his sake, I had rather she would not. I will not go to be crushed with pardon and obligation, while you are proscribed. I will be independent, and help to support the boy.' ...|$|E
60|$|Dismissing the {{messenger}} who waits below, <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> corridor {{in which my}} rooms are situated, and softly {{open the door of}} my bed-chamber. A second door communicates with the sitting-room, and has a ventilator in the upper part of it. I have only to stand under the ventilator, and every word of the conversation between Sir James and the physician reaches my ears.|$|E
60|$|Utopia! The word {{is enough}} to bring anyone out of bed, to the nearest window, but thence I see {{no more than the}} great {{mountain}} mass behind the inn, a very terrestrial looking mountain mass. <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> contrivances about me, and make my examination as I dress, pausing garment in hand to hover over first this thing of interest and then that.|$|E
60|$|At length he {{declared}} me a sound animal, {{and wrote a}} certificate to that effect, with which <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> deck.|$|R
60|$|Having sought my shawl, <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vestibule. M. Emanuel {{stood there}} as if waiting. He {{observed}} that the night was fine.|$|R
60|$|But one {{alternative}} remained. <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> street, <b>to</b> {{wait for}} Mrs. Van Brandt at the gallery door until the performance was over.|$|R
