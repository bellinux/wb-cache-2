Since he was the only Dallas-based member of the press in camera car two, Grant directed his driver to the Trade Mart, where they saw no activity. A worker across the street said he saw a limousine speed past, accompanied by motorcycles with their sirens blaring; Grant <b>knew</b> <b>immediately</b> that they were headed to Parkland Memorial Hospital. Once at Parkland, Grant started snapping pictures of anything he could, including Vice President Johnson's car, and a man and a police officer delivering what Grant believed was blood plasma.|$|E

I already knew Alan, but I didn't know the kids. It all just meshed, though, and we <b>knew</b> <b>immediately</b> what type of family {{we were going to}} be." [...] Susan was given a teaching job at the local high school and Karl became the local GP, giving the family immediate links with other characters. In 1995, Rainey Mayo portrayed a teenage Susan in a daydream. In October 2009, Woodburne became the longest-serving actress in the show's history, having appeared on-screen as Susan for fifteen years. Of her television milestone, Woodburne said, [...] "It seems both bizarre and wonderful to me that I'm coming up to 15 years on the show, even though the world of Neighbours feels instinctive and familiar, I'm still challenged and rewarded by the work." ...|$|E

Reporters and photographers rushed into the area from both directions, contributing to the confusion and chaos. As Kennedy lay wounded, Juan Romero cradled the senator's head and placed a rosary in his hand. Kennedy asked Romero, [...] "Is everybody OK?" [...] and Romero responded, [...] "Yes, everybody's OK." [...] Kennedy then turned away from Romero and said, [...] "Everything's going to be OK." [...] Captured by Life photographer Bill Eppridge and Boris Yaro of the Los Angeles Times, this moment became the iconic image of the assassination. There was some initial confusion in who was shot, one witness believing that the primary victim was Kennedy's campaign manager, Stephen Edward Smith. This was quickly realized to be untrue.|$|E
500|$|Jinks and Cohen {{involved}} Ball {{throughout the}} film's development, including casting and director selection. The producers met with about 20 interested directors, several {{of whom were}} considered [...] "A-list" [...] at the time. Ball was not keen on the more well-known directors because he believed their involvement would increase the budget and lead DreamWorks to become [...] "nervous about the content". Nevertheless, the studio offered the film to Mike Nichols and Robert Zemeckis; neither accepted. In the same year, Mendes (then a theater director) revived the musical Cabaret in New York with fellow director Rob Marshall. Beth Swofford of the Creative Artists Agency arranged meetings for Mendes with studio figures in Los Angeles to see if film direction was a possibility. Mendes came across American Beauty {{in a pile of}} eight scripts at Swofford's house, and <b>knew</b> <b>immediately</b> that it was the one he wanted to make; early in his career, he had been inspired by how the film Paris, Texas(1984) presented contemporary America as a mythic landscape and he saw the same theme in American Beauty, as well as parallels with his own childhood. Mendes later met with Spielberg; impressed by Mendes' productions of Oliver! and Cabaret, Spielberg encouraged him to consider American Beauty.|$|E

2500|$|Director Hugh Hudson was {{determined}} to cast young, unknown actors in all the major roles of the film, and to back them up by using veterans like John Gielgud, Lindsay Anderson, and Ian Holm as their supporting cast.

They then saw Scottish stage actor Ian Charleson performing the role of Pierre in the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of Piaf, and <b>knew</b> <b>immediately</b> they had found their man.

[...] "When I saw Eric Braeden's first performance- the voice, the power, the inner strength- I <b>knew</b> <b>immediately</b> that I didn't want to lose this man," [...] Bell said. [...] "He was exactly what the show needed. Not the hateful man we saw on-screen, but the man he could and would become."

Madonna explained her choice: [...] "I {{was looking for a}} certain quality: something fragile, androgynous and yet feminine in a really old-fashioned way. When I saw Andrea, I <b>knew</b> <b>immediately</b> she was the one." [...] Cornish commented on her role as Winthrop, [...] "Madonna is a strong, independent woman who doesn't need a man to define her– and that's admirable. She's studied every aspect of what happened with Wallis Simpson and Edward VIII. [...] It's a fascinating insight into class and romance. Madonna's created a contemporary woman—who I will play—called Wally, who is fascinated by what happened to Mrs. Simpson." [...] Madonna's daughter Lourdes was offered a part, but Madonna decided against the idea. However, she later allowed Lourdes to appear for a minor role in the film. The part she played was later confirmed by Cornish in an interview in March 2011 as the younger self of her character Wally Winthrop.|$|E
