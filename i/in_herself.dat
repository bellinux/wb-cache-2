5|$|Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) {{is angry}} that {{the club is}} now {{stronger}} than ever, and punishes Quinn and Santana. Quinn retaliates by thanking Sue for helping her realize that believing <b>in</b> <b>herself</b> negates the need to bring other people down. Will realizes that his passion is teaching, not performing, and resolves to recommit to the glee club.|$|E
5|$|According to latter {{episode of}} Devi Mahatmya, Durga created Matrikas from herself {{and with their}} help {{slaughtered}} the demon army. In this version, Kali {{is described as a}} Matrika, who sucked all the blood of demon Raktabija. Kali is given the epithet Chamunda in the text. When demon Shumbha challenges Durga to a single combat, she absorbs the Matrikas <b>in</b> <b>herself</b> and says that they are her different forms. In the Vamana Purana too, the Matrikas arise from different parts of Devi and not from male gods although they are described and named after the male deities.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of her death, Garza was a second grade teacher; she taught indigent {{students}} at an elementary school {{on the south side of}} McAllen. In a letter that Garza wrote to a friend shortly before her disappearance, Garza described herself as extremely shy, but she expressed fulfillment in her work. Noting that she had recently become secretary of her parent-teacher association, she said that she was beginning to feel more confident <b>in</b> <b>herself.</b> A member of the Legion of Mary, Garza took her Catholic faith seriously. In her letter, she indicated that was finding comfort in attending Mass and Communion every day.|$|E

5|$|That wasn't just a faith <b>in</b> <b>herself</b> and her talent, {{but also}} the ability to let herself go, to pray to God, and to trust in what would happen. These were, by far, her most inspiring words to date, letting others know {{that no matter what}} they were doing, no matter how {{difficult}} things were, with help they would win through. Musically, the piece had a restrained dance beat, very Mowtownish, that owed a little more to gospel, with a chorus - sung by Mariah, Trey and Patrique - that rose gloriously from the verse to repeat and drive and its very positive message home.|$|E
5|$|As {{punishment}} {{for bringing the}} world into chaos, Ashera subsequently petrifies Tellius; only the most powerful warriors and human-laguz half-breeds survive. She decides that humankind is unworthy of survival and must be eradicated, and recruits the Begnion senate to this end. Guided by Yune through Micaiah, who sides with humanity, Ike, Micaiah, and King Tibarn of Phoenicis lead three groups in a campaign through Begnion to the Tower of Guidance (a massive structure in Begnion's capital) where Ashera lies. Micaiah and her fellow Daeins seek to use the petrification {{of the world as}} a means to destroy the blood pact without harming Daein. Each of them run into the Disciples of Order, formerly regular {{men and women who have}} been empowered by Ashera to stop the protagonists. In separate engagements they confront various senators and Izuka, who reveals that Pelleas was not Ashnard's son, but an unwitting dupe used to place Daein further under Begnion's thumb. Ike also learns that the Black Knight's true identity is that of the Begnion general Zelgius. In an encounter with Senator Lekain, Empress Sanaki asks him why she has been declared a false apostle by the senate. Lekain responds that Sanaki lacks the clairvoyance and foresight traditionally associated with the royal line of Begnion as the trait only effects the eldest child, and that her (previously unknown) older sister was killed years previously. This revelation is outwardly refuted by the Empress, but she inwardly develops a degree of doubt <b>in</b> <b>herself.</b> All three armies eventual convene at the base of the Tower of Guidance. Fifteen heroes are then picked to be Yune's champions against Ashera.|$|E

She and Will share a private moment in a garden square as they walk back from the birthday party. The following evening {{they go to a}} restaurant, where Will overhears a group of patrons making crude remarks about Anna and attempts to defend her, before Anna steps <b>in</b> <b>herself</b> and humiliates them. As they walk back to her hotel, she invites Will up to her room. But when he arrives, she tells him he must leave immediately. Her American movie star boyfriend (who was never mentioned until now) appears and starts to bark orders at him, as well as make unflattering comments about Anna's weight. Anna is apologetic and embarrassed, while a stunned Will leaves. Over the next six months, Max and Bella set Will up on a series of blind dates, trying to help him move on; however Will, still hung up on Anna, does not connect with any of them.|$|E

5|$|For the actress, having Chloe {{become part}} of the meteor {{infected}} community in season six allowed Mack's character to continue to evolve. Mack views this transition as a means for her character to become more emotionally connected to those people—the meteor infected—she spent five seasons trying to expose to the public. Being infected by the meteors gives Chloe motivation to try to understand them and allows her to grow closer to Clark, as she can better understand {{what it feels like to}} live in a world where you have a special ability. Writer Holly Harold believes that, in addition to being infected by the meteor rocks, bringing Lois into the journalistic field also provides Chloe with a lot of ammunition for growth and development. Lois's presence at the Daily Planet allows Chloe the chance to reflect upon herself, and discover what things are most important to her – her career or her family and friends. The competition that Lois provides is beneficial, as it gives Chloe a chance to bring out the best <b>in</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sid {{finds the}} eighth spirit at the crater {{site of the}} alien asteroid's impact on Earth. He lowers a {{shielded}} vehicle, with Aki and Gray aboard, into the crater to locate the final spirit. Just before they can reach it, Hein fires the Zeus cannon into the crater, not only destroying the eighth spirit but also revealing the Phantom Gaia. Aki has {{a vision of the}} Phantom home planet, where she is able to receive the eighth spirit from the alien particles <b>in</b> <b>herself.</b> When Aki awakens, she and Gray combine it with the other seven. Hein continues to fire the Zeus cannon despite overheating warnings and unintentionally destroys the cannon and himself. Gray sacrifices himself as a medium needed to physically transmit the completed spirit into the alien Gaia. The Earth's Gaia is returned to normal as the Phantoms ascend into space, finally at peace. Aki is pulled from the crater holding Gray's body, and is seen looking into the newly liberated world.|$|E

The three fairies, Flora, Fauna and Merryweather, provide gowns and outfits for the trio, but Kilala's dress turns into that of a maid and is forced {{to work at the}} castle's party for Princess Aurora's 17th birthday. Kilala helps Prince Phillip's little cousin find a glass bead. When they do find it, the little princess gives it to her as a token for her help. Sylphy laughs at Kilala for being naïve and unsuitable to be a real princess. Princess Aurora finds Kilala on the balcony and tells her to keep on believing <b>in</b> <b>herself</b> and her love for Rei. Maleficent appears (disguise as Lady Malecent) and attempts to curse Aurora with magic rose thorns. Kilala shields the princess and falls under the spell. Rei breaks Maleficent's magic with true love's kiss. Right after Maleficent is defeated, the glass bead turns into a rose quartz and joins with the Tiara.|$|E

25|$|Fisher was {{considered}} {{by those who}} met {{her to be a}} strong, witty businesswoman who was not afraid to speak her mind. In 1919, Fisher gave a speech {{at a meeting of the}} National Negro Business League. In her speech, Fisher told those assembled how to make a profit from catering and about her life growing up. She said she was a 57 year old woman who was not afraid to tell her age. In 1907, Fisher divorced her husband William and offered him a little over 100 dollars to not contest the divorce in court. William refused and was awarded nothing by the court system. Fisher said that her marriage wasn't a success and that for her to be successful she had to believe <b>in</b> <b>herself</b> and no one else. Fisher put her daughter Lucille through college and a music conservatory with the profits from her catering business. Fisher's first home was a 16 room house on Park Avenue which stood until 1960. In the 1920s she had a house built along Old Highway 63. During construction, she bought the materials, hired her own workers, and stayed on the property in a tent to oversee construction. Fisher was a celebrated personality in Columbia, with multiple articles written about her in the University Missourian. One particularly interesting article was her suggestions for Thanksgiving dinner. Fisher rented her properties out to black families who couldn't find housing easily in 1913. Annie gave out her recipes freely, but noted that she couldn't teach the common sense needed to cook her food. In a 1927 article in the Springfield Leader, Fisher's estimated net worth was approximately 100,000 dollars. Fisher was buried in a modest grave in 1938 at the Memorial Park Cemetery in Columbia.|$|E

Part Two, [...] "Traveling", focus on the hardships, such as drug addiction, child abuse, inner-city life, and conditions in the Old South, that the author and others have experienced.

She gathered around her talented women {{writers such as}} Izumi Shikibu and Akazome Emon—the author of an early vernacular history, The Tale of Flowering Fortunes. The rivalry that existed among the women is evident in Murasaki's diary, where she wrote disparagingly of Izumi: [...] "Izumi Shikibu is an amusing letter-writer; {{but there is something}} not very satisfactory about her. She has a gift for dashing off informal compositions in a careless running-hand; but in poetry she needs either an interesting subject or some classic model to imitate.

500|$|Bannon was 22years {{old when}} she began writing her first pulp novel.

Bannon said, [...] "Both books completely obsessed me {{for the better part of}} two years." [...] Although recently married and on her way to having two children, she found the books struck a chord in her life and recognized emotions <b>in</b> <b>herself</b> that compelled her to write about them.

Natasha responds by taking advantage of her new independence to try to get Michael's attention. She also tries to get back on her father's good side, by doing some housekeeping, but Michael brushes it all aside.

[...] Natasha and Michael eventually make amends, but it is not an easy journey and they have a lot to work through.

In an {{interview}} with The Daily Telegraph, she revealed the reason for accepting the role was [...] "to play somebody who feels confident <b>in</b> <b>herself</b> as a sexy, beautiful woman".
