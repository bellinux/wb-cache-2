A hagiographic account has it that one night the Deity of Jagannath personally spoke to Kedarnath in a dream: [...] "I didn't bring you to Puri to execute legal matters, but to establish Vaishnava siddhanta." [...] Kedarnath replied, [...] "Your teachings have been significantly [...] depreciated, and I lack the power to restore them. Much of my life has passed and I am otherwise engaged, so please send somebody from Your personal staff so that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>start</b> this movement". Jagannath then requested Kedarnath to pray for an assistant {{to the image of}} the Goddess Bimala Devi worshiped in the Jagannath temple. When his wife gave birth to a new child, Kedarnath linked the event to the divinatory dream and named his son Bimala Prasad ('"the mercy of Bimala Devi"). The same account mentions that at his birth, the child's umbilical cord was looped around his body like a sacred brahmana thread (upavita) that left a permanent mark on the skin, as if foretelling his future role as religious leader.|$|E

I am now going to the mound in the cave to get out some of that gold, and I don't want anybody but you to go with me. I have just sent all the negroes down to the beach to carry things to the boat, and we must be quick about our business. You take this leather bag. It is Mrs. Cliff's, but I think it is strong enough. The lantern is lighted, so come on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{cannot be}} blamed," [...] Trent said. [...] "I am {{satisfied}} {{that you knew}} nothing about it. Now I am {{going to let you}} into a secret. Monty is a rich man if he had his rights, and I want to help him to them. I shall take him back to England with me, but I can't leave for a week or so. If you can keep him till then and have some one to watch him day and night, I'll give your husband a hundred pounds for your work here, and build you a church. It's all right! Don't look as though I were mad. I'm a very rich man, that's all, and I shan't miss the money, but I want to feel that Monty is safe till <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>start</b> back to England. Will you undertake this?" ...|$|E

"Not {{unless you}} like, Dicky. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> either <b>start</b> alone, or {{with someone else}} who has some {{knowledge}} of French; but I {{am not going to}} run the risk of being recaptured by taking anyone with me who cares so little for liberty that he grudges three or four hours' work, a day, to get up the means of making his escape." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{to write}} to-night then and accept?" [...] {{the young man}} asked. [...] "I knew you would both be of the same mind as myself, but of course I couldn't close with the offer until we had talked it over. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> get <b>started</b> {{in a week or}} two, and then {{in a couple of months}} I'll have all ready for you on the other side." ...|$|R

[...] "I know that I should never have done anything if it hadn't been for this, and though I am not fool enough to suppose I am ever going to turn out anything great, I am sure that after a couple of years' hard work I ought to paint decently, and anyhow to turn out as good things as some of those men. It is just what I have always been wanting, though I did not know it. I am afraid I shall have to cut all those dear old fellows, for I should never be able to give myself up to work among them. I should say it would be best for me to go over to Paris; <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>start</b> on a fresh groove there. At my age I should not like to go through any of the schools here. I might have three months with Terrier; that would be just the thing to give me a good start; he is a good fellow but one who never earns more than bread and cheese.|$|E
6000|$|It's treachery to her memory. But {{you don't}} {{know what it}} is when your prison door is opened. [As he speaks he grows more and more excited.] I don't want to die. I want to live, and I want to take life by both hands and enjoy it. I've got such a desire for happiness. Let's open the windows, and let the {{sunlight}} in. [He goes to the window and flings it open.] It's so good just to be alive. How can I help thinking that now <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>start</b> fresh? The slate is wiped clean, and I can begin again. I will be happy. God forgive me, I can't help the thought. I'm free. I made a ghastly mistake, and I suffered for it. Heaven knows how I suffered, and how hard I tried {{to make the best of}} it. It wasn't all my fault. In this world we're made to act and think things because other people have thought them good. We never have a chance of going our own way. We're bound down by the prejudices and the morals of everybody else. For God's sake, let us be free. Let us do this and that because we want to and because we must, not because other people think we ought. [He stops suddenly in front of JOHN.] Why don't you say something?

We have had all sorts of rich men backing up literary enterprises, but the natural-gas man in literature is a new thing, and the combination of your picturesque past and your aesthetic present is something that will knock out the sympathies of the American public the first round. I feel," [...] said Fulkerson, with a tremor of pathos in his voice, [...] "that 'Every Other Week' is at a disadvantage before the public as long as it's supposed to be my enterprise, my idea. As far as I'm known at all, I'm known simply as a syndicate man, and nobody in the press believes that I've got the money to run the thing on a grand scale; a suspicion of insolvency must attach to it sooner or later, and the fellows on the press will work up that impression, sooner or later, if we don't give them something else to work up. Now, as soon as I begin to give it away to the correspondents that you're in it, with your untold millions--that, in fact, it was your idea from the start, that you originated it to give full play to the humanitarian tendencies of Conrad here, who's always had these theories of co-operation, and longed to realize them for the benefit of our struggling young writers and artists--" ...|$|E

"So {{often there}} is {{conflict}} between them, {{and this is}} my greatest sorrow....Whatever I have written is to try to help our own people to understand and to get rid of their fear and suspicion of abstraction in Western art.

60|$|DEAR FOLKS,--I enclose $20 for Ma. I thought I {{was getting}} ahead of her little {{assessments}} of $35 a month, but find I am falling behind with her instead, and have let her go without money. Well, I {{did not mean to}} do it. But you see when people have been getting ready for months in a quiet way to get married, they are bound to grow stingy, and go to saving up money against that awful day when it is sure to be needed. I am particularly anxious to place myself in a position where I can carry on my married life in good shape on my own hook, because I have paddled my own canoe so long that I could not be satisfied now to let anybody help me--and my proposed father-in-law is naturally so liberal that it would be just like him to want to give us a start in life. But I don't want it that way. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>start</b> myself. I don't want any help. I can run this institution without any outside assistance, and I shall have a wife who will stand by me like a soldier through thick and thin, and never complain. She is only a little body, but she hasn't her peer in Christendom. I gave her only a plain gold engagement ring, when fashion imperatively demands a two-hundred dollar diamond one, and told her it was typical of her future lot--namely, {{that she would have to}} flourish on substantials rather than luxuries. (But you see I know the girl--she don't care anything about luxuries.) She is a splendid girl. She spends no money but her usual year's allowance, and she spends nearly every cent of that on other people. She will be a good sensible little wife, without any airs about her. I don't make intercession for her beforehand and ask you to love her, for there isn't any use in that--you couldn't help it if you were to try.|$|E

5000|$|Dan Goldin {{had been}} working at Island Def Jam Music Group but was {{dissatisfied}} working with music he didn't quite enjoy {{as much as the}} bands he and Spak had been seeing at local shows around the area. While working at Def Jam, Goldin decided to start operating a music blog which was the first appearance of the Exploding in Sound name. According to an interview with Consequence of Sound, Goldin stated: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do this blog long enough to where it develops an audience, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> eventually <b>start</b> a label which in theory, has a built-in audience with that same taste."

However, as his relationship deepens and he grows closer to Sango, he can no longer find solace in its words and phrases.
