The Quagmires {{disguise}} themselves as Klaus and Violet, get a sack of flour to represent Sunny, and do the exercises (at night) so that the Baudelaire orphans can study and make staples (Coach Genghis doesn't know that it's the Quagmires that are running because it is night time and he can't see them.) The Quagmires leave their notebooks with Violet and Klaus so that they can study. Violet invents a staple-making device (using a small crab, a potato, metal rods, creamed spinach, and a fork) and makes staples while Klaus reads the notebooks out loud.|$|E

500|$|The Simpson {{family is}} advised of a citywide nuclear safety drill {{and all the}} {{inhabitants}} of Springfield are told {{to stay in their}} basements for three hours. The family members quickly become bored in the basement and decide to leave the house and <b>go</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> empty city. As they walk through Springfield, they see an unusual number of cars parked by the City Hall. The Simpsons go in and discover that everyone in town has gathered for a secret town meeting and have voted unanimously to kick them out of Springfield forever. Mayor Quimby reveals that the city has gone bankrupt due to the constant cleaning up of the family's shenanigans over the years, ranging from Homer's drunken antics, Bart's various pranks, and Lisa's environmental concerns. Marge delivers a heart-felt plea to the residents to let the Simpsons live in the one place they call home, but they refuse, with Quimby declaring her the [...] "worst Simpson" [...] for always trying to see the family in a positive light.|$|E

500|$|The play {{had a good}} initial run, {{although}} Horner's trick and {{the notorious}} china scene immediately raised offence. Wycherley laughed off such criticisms in his next play, The Plain Dealer (1676), where he has the hypocritical Olivia exclaim that the china scene in The Country Wife [...] "has quite taken away the reputation of poor china itself, and sullied the most innocent and pretty furniture of a lady's chamber". Olivia's sensible cousin Eliza insists that she'll <b>go</b> <b>see</b> <b>The</b> Country Wife anyway: [...] "All this will not put me out of conceit with china, nor the play, which is acted today, {{or another of the}} same beastly author's, as you call him, which I'll go see." [...] Writing himself into The Plain Dealer as the [...] "beastly author" [...] of the china scene, Wycherley seems more amused than repentant. The Country Wife did in fact survive the complaints to become a dependable repertory play from 1675 till the mid-1740s, but by then public taste had changed too much to put up with the sex jokes any longer. Its last eighteenth century performance in 1753 was followed by a hiatus of 171 years, until the successful Phoenix Society production in 1924 at the Regent Theatre in London. The first-ever American performance of Wycherley's original Country Wife took place in 1931.|$|E
500|$|Part 1 {{begins as}} the group heads off to Ross's wedding in London leaving behind a heavily {{pregnant}} Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow), and Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), who has declined the invitation. In London, Joey (Matt LeBlanc) and Chandler (Matthew Perry) <b>go</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> sights in a musical montage featuring The Clash's song [...] "London Calling", with Joey filming everything on his camcorder. Chandler becomes embarrassed by his friend's enthusiasm, and after Joey buys a large Union Flag hat from a vendor (played by guest star Richard Branson), they part company. They reunite in their hotel room and Chandler apologizes. Joey impresses him with a video recording of Sarah, Duchess of York (who played herself). Emily takes Ross to the hall where the wedding will be, but they discover it is being demolished earlier than originally scheduled. Monica later suggests Emily postpone the wedding until everything is perfect. She passes the thought on to Ross, angering him; he tells her people have flown from America {{to be there and}} that it is [...] "now or never"; she chooses [...] "never". Monica berates Ross for his insensitivity and Ross apologizes to Emily, showing her the ceremony can still take place in the half-demolished hall that he has tidied up. She agrees. In New York, Rachel realizes she still loves Ross, and flies to London to tell him.|$|E

Coxey, Sr. decided to replicate his 1894 poor people's protest march and lead a group of unemployed workers to Washington, D.C. When [...] "Coxey's Army" [...] reached Massillon, Fairless resolved to <b>go</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> march. [...] Passing by the Central Steel Company plant (then under construction) on a train, Fairless decided not to see the march. Instead, he got off the train, went to the steel plant construction site, and asked the surveying team foreman for a job. He was given a job on the spot. He was promoted from [...] "transit man" [...] (someone who operated a theodolite for the surveying team) to engineer when another person failed to show up for work for a week. After the plant was finished, he was asked to stay on at the steel mill rather than travel to another Central Steel construction site near Chicago.|$|E
2500|$|Producer Burk {{explained}} the viral tie-in, [...] "It was all done {{in conjunction with}} the studio... The whole experience in making this movie is very reminiscent of how we did Lost." [...] Director [...] Reeves described Slusho! as [...] "part of the involved connectivity" [...] with Abrams' Alias and that the drink represented a [...] "meta-story" [...] for Cloverfield. The director explained, [...] "It's almost like tentacles that grow out of the film and lead, also, to the ideas in the film. And there's this weird way where you can <b>go</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> movie and it's one experience... But there's also this other place where you can get engaged where there's this other sort of aspect for all those people who are into that. All the stories kind of bounce off one another and inform each other. But, {{at the end of the}} day, this movie stands on its own to be a movie.... The Internet sort of stories and connections and clues are, in a way, a prism and they're another way of looking at the same thing. To us, it's just another exciting aspect of the storytelling." ...|$|E
