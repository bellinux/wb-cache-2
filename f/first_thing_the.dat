25|$|For Merezhkovsky the October Socialist {{revolution}} was a catastrophe. He {{saw it as}} the Coming of Ham he wrote about a decade later, the tragic victory for, as he choose to put it, Narod-Zver (The Beast-nation), {{the political and social}} incarnation of the universal Evil, putting the whole human civilization to danger. Merezhkovsky and Gippius tried to use whatever influence they retained upon the Bolshevist cultural leaders to ensure the release of their friends, the arrested Provisional government ministers. Ironically, one of the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> Soviet government did was lift the ban from anti-monarchist Pavel Pervy play and it was staged in several Red Russia's theaters.|$|E
25|$|After Arthur {{has taken}} {{each of the}} seven keys, and the will becomes fulfilled, a huge wave of Nothing dissolves the Incomparable Gardens, Lord Sunday's domain, and the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> Architect created. This causes the whole of {{creation}} to be destroyed with it including all of the secondary realms (including Earth). Arthur regains consciousness in the void of Nothing (as he holds the power of all seven keys, he is unable to be destroyed unless he so wishes), and he meets the Architect, who is revealed to be the Old One and the Will, once split into two parts to govern the house and the secondary realms respectively. When the Architect and the Old One fell out, the Architect chained the Old One eternally. Doing this meant that she could not return to Nothing when she wished, as she had to go as one. The only way to release the Old One was to destroy creation. These terms were laid out in the will.|$|E
25|$|Arnaz {{appeared}} in several {{movies in the}} 1940s such as Bataan (1943). He received his draft notice, but before reporting, he injured his knee. He completed his recruit training, but was classified for limited service in the United States Army during World War II. He was assigned to direct United Service Organization (U.S.O.) programs at a military hospital in the San Fernando Valley. Discovering the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> wounded soldiers requested was a glass of cold milk, he arranged for movie starlets to meet them and pour the milk for them. Following his discharge from the Army, he formed another orchestra, which was successful in live appearances and recordings. He sang for troops in Birmingham Hospital with John Macchia and hired his childhood friend Marco Rizo to play piano and arrange for the orchestra. When he became successful in television, he kept the orchestra on his payroll, and Rizo arranged and orchestrated the music for I Love Lucy.|$|E

25|$|Ian Redpath and Wally Edwards saw {{off the new}} {{ball and}} were 1/0 at stumps on the first day. The next day Bob Willis (2/91) hit Edwards with a bouncer and appealed for Redpath caught behind off his gloves, which was {{declined}} by the umpire. They took the score to 64 runs {{in less than an}} hour when Edwards hit Tony Greig to David Lloyd at cover-point. The usually static Redpath was stumped when he danced down the wicket to Fred Titmus (2/84) and Ian Chappell edged Geoff Arnold (2/129) to Alan Knott while trying to leg glance, leaving Australia 113/3. Greg Chappell made 62, his fifth successive 50 against the tourists and added 79 runs with Ross Edwards by tea, though Titmus conceded only 20 runs in nine 8-ball overs. Chappell was out at 192/4 when he cut Willis into the gully where Colin Cowdrey knocked the ball up to be caught by Greig. After tea Doug Walters came out and took command of the game as Denness declined to use Willis to attack his well-known weakness around the off stump. Instead Greig sent up his slow off-cutters and gave away 69 runs off nine overs. Walters reached his 50 in 44 minutes, followed by that of Edwards in 174 minutes. The English fielding became ragged as they added 158 runs after tea. Walters reached his century off the last ball of the day by pulling Willis for six and was engulfed by fans as he left the field, as well they might as he was the first batsman since Bradman to score a hundred runs in a session in an Ashes Test. Australia were 352/4 and well ahead in the game, but the Australian team played a trick on Walters when he returned, hiding in the showers before coming out to congratulate him. He was out <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> next day, caught by Fletcher in the gully off Willis waving his bat outside off-stump for 103, but Edwards stayed in to make 115, having been 79 overnight and became the first Western Australian to make a hundred at the WACA. He was bowled by Arnold, but Rod Marsh hit 41 and the tail added 65 runs before Chris Old cleared things up with 3/85. Australia made 481, a lead of 273 in the first innings and few thought England could avoid an innings defeat.|$|E
500|$|Both sides {{tried to}} exploit the Villers-Bocage battle for propaganda. Having escaped from their knocked-out tank, Lieutenant John Cloudsley-Thompson and his crew of the 4th CLY {{spent much of the}} day in a {{basement}} in Villers-Bocage. They made their way back after dark and were picked up by troops of the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division. During debriefing Cloudsley-Thompson said that he [...] "never wished to see another tank as long as [...] lived" [...] but the British press reported this as: [...] "The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> five tank men asked for was another tank". Because the British had lost contact with the forces on Point 213 and withdrawn from Villers-Bocage, they were ignorant of the losses on both sides. The German propaganda machine swiftly credited Wittmann, a household name in Germany, with all the British tanks destroyed at Villers-Bocage.|$|E

In the episode's first draft, Gloria worked as a food truck driver; however, this was later changed so that she instead worked as a police lady. Scully also stated that, in the scene after Homer carries Burns and Gloria up the stairs, there were originally a lot of jokes about Homer [...] "taking care of business" [...] for Burns; however, the staff decided to leave it out since it would make Homer [...] "unlikable."

500|$|Choosing a {{name for}} the game was the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> team did before {{starting}} development. They decided on the name Sunset Overdrive because they felt it was unique, and captured the feeling of the [...] "grindhouse" [...] from the 1970s. The project was originally conceived as an open world survival game similar to DayZ. The initial version of the game did not feature the traversal system, nor the unusual weapons included in the final version, and was described as [...] "grounded" [...] by Murray. In this version, players were tasked with scavenging resources during daytime, and defending their base at night. This later evolved to become the game's cooperative multiplayer mode. It employed the animation model from Insomniac's previous game, Fuse. The direction of the game changed after the team watched a video based on Gorillaz, and Murray gave up the idea of a realistic survival game. He then asked the team to start prototyping ideas for a game that they thought would work. Some team members {{came up with the idea}} of having skateboarding elements in the game, which led the development team to start working and experimenting with a new traversal system. In hindsight, Murray described the shift in focus as an [...] "organic, evolutionary process". As the game's development progressed, the team began to draw on elements from other video game franchises such as Prince of Persia, Jet Set Radio, and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, and put the emphasis on momentum.|$|E

Well aware that he was detested by his subjects, Lê Uy Mục protected himself by hiring a group of elite bodyguards to surround him at all times. Among them was Mạc Đăng Dung, who became very close to the emperor and eventually rose to the rank of general. Despite his precautions, in 1509 a cousin, whom Lê Uy Mục had put in prison, escaped and plotted with court insiders to assassinate the emperor.

2500|$|The {{whole process}} unravels when H arrives {{at its own}} number K. We will proceed with our example. Suppose the successful-tally/record R stands at 12. H finally arrives at its own number minus 1, i.e. N = K-1 = 4335...3214, and this number is unsuccessful. Then H {{increments}} N to produce K = 4355...3215, i.e. its own number. H converts this to “LDDR...DCAR” and passes it to decision-machine D. Decision-machine D must return “satisfactory” (that is: H must by definition {{go on and on}} testing, ad infinitum, because it is [...] "circle-free"). So H now increments tally R from 12 to 13 and then re-converts the number-under-test K into its S.D and uses U to simulate it. But this means that H will be simulating its own motions. What is the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> simulation will do? This simulation K-aka-H either creates a new N or “resets” the “old” N to 1. This [...] "K-aka-H" [...] either creates a new R or “resets” the “old” R to 0. Old-H “runs” new [...] "K-aka-H" [...] until it arrives at its 12th figure.|$|E
2500|$|One {{afternoon}} in August 1913, Captain Bucey {{was attempting to}} run the BC Express through the Grand Canyon {{when he realized that}} the current was particularly strong in the whirlpool. Bucey decided that it would be necessary to line the sternwheeler through the canyon, and was pulling over to the side when a [...] spruce tree, complete with root structure, appeared {{on the surface of the}} whirlpool and swept under the BC Express, jamming against her three main rudders. Though Bucey had lost his main method of steering, he was still able to use the steamer's paddlewheel to maneuver backwards through the canyon, where he would eventually come to a place along the shore where he could tie up and his crew could disembark and remove the tree and check for damages. Most of his passengers, knowing Bucey's skillful reputation, were untroubled by the BC Express's plight, but one man panicked and raced across the bow and leapt onto the canyon wall, where he was left clinging 6 feet above the whirlpool. Unable to do anything for the passenger, Bucey had to continue downstream, where half an hour later he was able to tie up. After landing, Bucey's first thought was for his stranded passenger, and he sent out a rescue party of three men, led by AK Bouchier, the BC Express Company's agent at Tête Jaune Cache. The men walked back up the canyon and were relieved and astonished to find the man still clinging to the canyon wall, 70 feet below them. One of the rescuers was lowered down with a rope, and the passenger was hauled up to safety. The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> rescued man did was check his pockets for two small leather bags he was carrying, both full of diamond rings that he peddled along the new rail towns to brothels and private buyers. Once assured that his precious diamonds were safe, he was taken back to his berth on the BC Express and given a stiff scotch.|$|E
