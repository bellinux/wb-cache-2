Abraham said of the franchise, [...] "I was around when the series was first introduced to television {{and it was a}} hoot", He praised his make-up and prosthetics, saying [...] "The <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> be somebody else behind the mask is an extraordinary feelingit's very primitive and mysterious. A gap opens somewhere in the brain and it encourages wildness. It had me chewing at the scenery". He was particularly pleased to be working with Patrick Stewart.|$|E
500|$|The {{violence}} of the fight clubs serves not to promote or glorify physical combat, but for participants to experience feeling {{in a society where}} they are otherwise numb. The fights tangibly represent a resistance to the impulse to be [...] "cocooned" [...] in society. Norton believed that the fighting between the men strips away the [...] "fear of pain" [...] and [...] "the reliance on material signifiers of their self-worth", leaving them to experience something valuable. When the fights evolve into revolutionary violence, the film only half-accepts the revolutionary dialectic by Tyler Durden; the Narrator pulls back and rejects Durden's ideas. Fight Club purposely shapes an ambiguous message, the interpretation of which is left to the audience. Fincher elaborated, [...] "I love this <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> have fascism without offering any direction or solution. Isn't the point of fascism to say, 'This is the way we should be going'? But this movie couldn't be further from offering any kind of solution." ...|$|E

Gray said, [...] "At this point, {{people who are going to}} see Avatar are going to see Avatar and would even if the slate was strong." [...] Marketing the film as a [...] "novelty factor" [...] also helped. Fox positioned the film as a cinematic event that should be seen in the theatres. [...] "It's really hard to sell the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> have the same experience at home," [...] stated David Mumpower, an analyst at BoxOfficeProphets.com. The [...] "Oscar buzz" [...] surrounding the film and international viewings helped. [...] "Two-thirds of Titanics haul was earned overseas, and Avatar [...] similarly...Avatar opened in 106 markets globally and was No. 1 in all of them", and the markets [...] "such as Russia, where Titanic saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today" [...] with [...] "more screens and moviegoers" [...] than before.|$|E

500|$|In {{collaboration}} with composer David Julyan, Nolan's films featured slow and atmospheric scores with minimalistic expressions and ambient textures. In the mid-2000s, starting with Batman Begins, Nolan {{began working with}} Hans Zimmer, {{who is known for}} integrating electronic music with traditional orchestral arrangements. With Zimmer, the soundscape in Nolan's films evolved into becoming increasingly more lush, kinetic and experimental. An example of this is the main theme from Inception, which is derived from a slowed down version of Edith Piaf's song Non, je ne regrette rien. For 2014's Interstellar, Zimmer and Nolan wanted to move in a new direction: [...] "The textures, the music, and the sounds, and the thing we sort of created has sort of seeped into other people's movies a bit, so it's time to reinvent." [...] The score for Dunkirk (2017) was written to accommodate the auditory illusion of a Shepard tone, as well as being based on a recording of Nolan's own pocket watch, which he sent to Zimmer to be synthesised. Responding to some criticism over his [...] "experimental" [...] sound mix for Interstellar, Nolan said, [...] "I've always loved films that approach sound in an impressionistic way and that is an unusual approach for a mainstream blockbuster ... I don't agree with the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> only achieve clarity through dialogue. Clarity of story, clarity of emotions — I try to achieve that in a very layered way using all the different things at my disposal — picture and sound." ...|$|E

[...] It takes two points to define a straight line, three points to fully define a quadratic, four points to define a cubic curve, and so on.

[...] The method is to create a polynomial of degree t − 1 with the secret as the first coefficient and the remaining coefficients picked at random. [...] Next find n points on the curve and give one to each of the players.
