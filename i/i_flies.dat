Flies' Prussians were defeated in the Battle of Langensalza, but the Hanoverians were unable to capitalize on their victory. Falckenstein's troops arrived the following day, and Arentschildt was forced to flee eastward into territory ringed by Prussian railways, leading to Hanover's surrender at Nordhausen on 29 June.|$|E
5000|$|The words {{containing}} the i sound, cry, <b>I,</b> <b>flies,</b> suicidal, drive, Eye, all represent her thrusting her 'I'dentity into reality.From a feminist view point though, this poem is troubled. Earlier {{in the poem}} her [...] "I"ness is repressed, for the [...] "Nigger-eye" [...] represents her [...] "Nigger-"I"", for she is still repressed by her father or male dominance in general, as espoused in [...] "Daddy". As the poem progresses, she begins a series of transformations out of this repressed self.First in the poem she becomes a stallion, a masculine image, {{the image of her}} repressor. Then as she picks up speed she becomes an arrow, a penetrating force which alongside her becoming [...] "one with the drive" [...] suggests she is becoming her rapist (her father) in order to prevent her submission and kill her father. Finally though, she loses this identity and breaks down into water, which Freud (who she was read up on) defines as a feminine symbol, as well as being a purifying substance.|$|E
40|$|Lysozyme {{amyloidosis}} is a {{hereditary disease}} in which mutations in the gene coding for lysozyme leads to misfolding and consequently accumulation of amyloid material. To improve {{understanding of the}} processes involved we expressed human wild type (WT) lysozyme and the disease-associated variant F 57 I in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) of a Drosophila melanogaster model of lysozyme amyloidosis, with and without co-expression of serum amyloid p component (SAP). SAP is known to be a universal constituent of amyloid deposits and to associate with lysozyme fibrils. There are clear indications that SAP may {{play an important role in}} lysozyme amyloidosis, which requires further elucidation. We found that flies expressing the amyloidogenic variant F 57 I in the CNS have a shorter lifespan than flies expressing WT lysozyme. We also identified apoptotic cells in the brains of F 57 <b>I</b> <b>flies</b> demonstrating that the flies neurological functions are impaired when F 57 I is expressed in the nerve cells. However, co-expression of SAP in the CNS prevented cell death and restored the F 57 <b>I</b> <b>flies</b> lifespan. Thus, SAP has the apparent ability to protect nerve cells from damage caused by F 57 I. Furthermore, it was found that co-expression of SAP prevented accumulation of insoluble forms of lysozyme in both WT- and F 57 I-expressing flies. Our findings suggest that the F 57 I mutation affects the aggregation process of lysozyme resulting in the formation of cytotoxic species and that SAP is able to prevent cell death in the F 57 <b>I</b> <b>flies</b> by preventing accumulation of toxic F 57 I structures.

40|$|Knowledge {{about how}} parasites choose their hosts is scarce and incomplete. Recent work has {{primarily}} focused on host health (i. e. immunocompetence) whereas ecological {{factors have been}} largely neglected. Here we investigate whether the immunocompetence, the nutritional condition or body size of nestling European bee-eaters Merops apiaster are used as parameters for habitat choice of the haematophagous fly Carnus hemapterus. We found that (<b>i)</b> <b>flies</b> consistently and nonrandomly preferred larger nestlings, even after controlling for differences in habitat availability (host surface), (ii) {{in the presence of}} similar-sized hosts, parasites' choice for an individual was less likely than if hosts differed in size, (iii) the more the hosts differed in size, the more the parasites aggregated on the larger nestling and (iv) parasites changed their preference according to size criteria regardless of the identity of the larger host. Neither immunocompetence nor host body condition could account for parasites' preference. Our results do not support the prediction of the Tasty Chick Hypothesis, namely that the poor immunocompetence ability of junior chicks makes them more attractive to parasites. We conclude that basic ecological factors (e. g. body size) can be essential for parasites when choosing a host...|$|E
40|$|Variations in egg length were {{observed}} for two populations of cryptic species of Anastrepha fraterculus (Wiedemann). The eggs of type <b>I</b> <b>flies</b> were smaller {{than those of}} type II individuals. For both types, in regard to yolk mass extrusion, four classes of embryos were detected. Class 1 : embryos that extrude masses at both extremities; class 2 : embryos in which extrusion occurs only at the anterior pole; class 3 : embryos that eliminate mass only at the posterior pole, and class 4 : embryos that do not extrude any mass. Embryo class frequencies were similar for populations belonging to the same type, but different between types. Individual females may produce eggs from different embryo classes, but for any given female the pattern remains constant during {{a long period of}} oviposition. Variation in size of the extruded masses was similar for both populations. Individual females produced embryos with a small range of mass diameters, and different females produced masses of different mean size. However, individual mass size remained constant during oviposition. The results suggest the existence of genetic components involved in the control of this unusual process. Larvae of both types presented, just before eclosion, similar unusual behaviors: they ingest the anterior extruded mass, rotate 180 °, absorb the posterior mass and eclose near the posterior pole. Data show that cryptic A. fraterculus type I and type II differs in regard to egg size {{as well as to the}} phenomenon of yolk mass extrusio...|$|E
