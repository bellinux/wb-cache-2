5|$|A recent calm period, {{with almost}} no {{earthquake}} or magmatic activity at Hualālai, has seen the growth of homes, businesses, and resorts on the mountain's flanks. The most recent major activity at the volcano was in 1929, when an intense earthquake swarm rocked Hualālai, most likely caused by magmatic action near the volcano's peak. Although it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>relatively</b> placid in the recent past, Hualālai is still potentially active, {{and is expected to}} erupt again within the next 100years.|$|E
5|$|Mycobacteria infect many {{different}} animals, including birds, rodents, and reptiles. The subspecies Mycobacterium tuberculosis, though, is rarely present in wild animals. An effort to eradicate bovine tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium bovis from the cattle and deer herds of New Zealand <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>relatively</b> successful. Efforts in Great Britain {{have been less}} successful.|$|E
5|$|Planetary {{science is}} the study of the {{assemblage}} of planets, moons, dwarf planets, comets, asteroids, and other bodies orbiting the Sun, as well as extrasolar planets. The Solar System <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>relatively</b> well-studied, initially through telescopes and then later by spacecraft. This has provided a good overall understanding of the formation and evolution of this planetary system, although many new discoveries are still being made.|$|E

5|$|The {{price for}} pure bismuth metal <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>relatively</b> stable {{through most of}} the 20th century, except for a spike in the 1970s. Bismuth has always been {{produced}} mainly as a byproduct of lead refining, and thus the price usually reflected the cost of recovery and the balance between production and demand.|$|E
5|$|All {{historical}} eruptions at Kīlauea {{have occurred}} {{at one of}} three places: its summit caldera, its eastern rift zone, or its southwestern rift zone. Half of Kīlauea's historical eruptions have occurred at or near Kīlauea's summit caldera. Activity there was nearly continuous {{for much of the}} 19th century, capped by a massive explosive eruption in 1924 before petering out by 1934. Recent activity has mostly shifted to Kīlauea's eastern rift zone, the site of 24 historical eruptions, located mostly on its upper section; by contrast, the volcano's southwestern rift zone <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>relatively</b> quiet, and has only been the site of five events to date.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, {{the use of}} {{the flag}} and other {{national}} symbols <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>relatively</b> low for most of the time since the Second World War—a reaction against the widespread use of flags by the Nazi Party and against the nationalistic furore of the Nazis in general. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which took place in Germany, public use of the national flag increased dramatically. Although this explosion in the flag's popularity was initially greeted by many Germans with a mixture of surprise and apprehension, the decades-old fear that German flag-waving and national pride was inextricably associated with its Nazi past was dismissed {{by the end of the}} tournament by Germans and non-Germans alike.|$|E

5|$|Rae is not {{included}} in Max Germaine's Dictionary of Women Artists in Australia, Caroline Ambrus's The Ladies' Picture Show, or Helen Topliss's Modernism and Feminism: Australian Women Artists 1900–1940. Nevertheless, the secondary market for Rae's works <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>relatively</b> strong, with one work selling in 2012 for 10,000 Euros, as against a pre-auction estimate of two-thirds that sum. Works by Rae are held in the collections of the National Gallery of Australia, National Gallery of Victoria, and the Australian War Memorial. Outside Australia, her work is represented in the Musée du Touquet, just outside Étaples township.|$|E
5|$|The volcano has two {{fields of}} fumaroles (<) {{in the area}} between Uturunku's two summits and has caused {{hydrothermal}} alteration of country rock. These fumaroles form visible clouds of steam. This heat may have been replenished from the APVC melt generating zone or survived since the last eruption of the volcano. Fumarolic activity is distinct enough to be visible from ASTER satellite image but barely visible from the ground. The temperature of the hotspot <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>relatively</b> constant in contrast to Lascar. The presence of lava flows overlying moraines, which indicate post-glacial activity, is controversial; the summit lava flows have been glaciated.|$|E
5|$|Living mammals {{are divided}} into the Yinotheria (platypus and echidnas) and Theriiformes (all other mammals). There are around 5450 species of mammal, {{depending}} on which authority is cited. In some classifications, extant mammals {{are divided into}} two subclasses: the Prototheria, that is, the order Monotremata; and the Theria, or the infraclasses Metatheria and Eutheria. The marsupials constitute the crown group of the Metatheria, and include all living metatherians {{as well as many}} extinct ones; the placentals are the crown group of the Eutheria. While mammal classification at the family level <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>relatively</b> stable, several contending classifications regarding the higher levels—subclass, infraclass and order, especially of the marsupials—appear in contemporaneous literature. Much of the changes reflect the advances of cladistic analysis and molecular genetics. Findings from molecular genetics, for example, have prompted adopting new groups, such as the Afrotheria, and abandoning traditional groups, such as the Insectivora.|$|E

5|$|Shostakovich's musical {{influence}} on later composers outside the former Soviet Union <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>relatively</b> slight, although Alfred Schnittke {{took up his}} eclecticism and his contrasts between the dynamic and the static, and some of André Previn's music shows clear links to Shostakovich's style of orchestration. His influence {{can also be seen}} in some Nordic composers, such as Lars-Erik Larsson. Many of his Russian contemporaries, and his pupils at the Leningrad Conservatory were strongly influenced by his style (including German Okunev, Boris Tishchenko, whose 5th Symphony of 1978 is dedicated to Shostakovich's memory, Sergei Slonimsky, and others). Shostakovich's conservative idiom has grown increasingly popular with audiences both within and beyond Russia, as the avant-garde has declined in influence and debate about his political views has developed.|$|E
5|$|The Cascade Range was {{produced}} by convergence of the North American Plate with the subducting Juan de Fuca Plate. Active volcanism has taken place for approximately 36million years; the nearby Challis Range features complexes as old as 55 mya. Most geologists believe that activity in the Cascades <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>relatively</b> intermittent, producing up to 3,000 volcanic calderas at a time. Frequent volcanism within the last 10,000years created complexes from Mount Garibaldi in British Columbia to north California's Lassen Peak complex. Remarkably different from state to state, the volcanism ranges from large volcanoes to zones of many smaller geologic features such as lava shields and cinder cones. TheCascadevolcanoes are divided into two large sectors, called the High Cascades and the Western Cascades; Thielsen {{is part of the}} High Cascades, which are east of the Western Cascades.|$|E
5|$|The Minister of the Interior is {{responsible}} for the national police force, paramilitary force (gendarmerie) and the secret police. The police and gendarmerie are stationed and administered at the local level. However, in 2009 fewer than a third of all communes had access to the services of these security forces, with most lacking local-level headquarters for either corps. Traditional community tribunals, called dina, are presided over by elders and other respected figures and remain a key means by which justice is served in rural areas where state presence is weak. Historically, security <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>relatively</b> high across the island. Violent crime rates are low, and criminal activities are predominantly crimes of opportunity such as pickpocketing and petty theft, although child prostitution, human trafficking and the production and sale of marijuana and other illegal drugs are increasing. Budget cuts since 2009 have severely impacted the national police force, producing a steep increase in criminal activity in recent years.|$|E
