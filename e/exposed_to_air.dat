5|$|Abyssal plains are {{typically}} covered by very deep sea, but during {{parts of the}} Messinian salinity crisis much of the Mediterranean Sea's abyssal plain was <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>air</b> as an empty hot dry salt-floored sink.|$|E
5|$|Carbon may burn vigorously and brightly in the {{presence}} of air at high temperatures. Large accumulations of coal, which have remained inert for hundreds of millions of years in the absence of oxygen, may spontaneously combust when <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>air</b> in coal mine waste tips, ship cargo holds and coal bunkers, and storage dumps.|$|E
5|$|Many older {{buildings}} {{in certain areas}} of Boston are supported by wooden piles driven into the area's fill; these piles remain sound if submerged in water, but are subject to dry rot if <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>air</b> for long periods.|$|E

50|$|Water migrates {{from areas}} of high aw to areas of low aw. For example, if honey (aw ≈ 0.6) is <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> humid <b>air</b> (aw ≈ 0.7), the honey absorbs {{water from the}} air. If salami (aw ≈ 0.87) is <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> dry <b>air</b> (aw ≈ 0.5), the salami dries out, which could {{preserve}} it or spoil it.|$|R
30|$|Pregnant C 57 BL/ 6 mice were <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> room <b>air</b> or SHS for 14  days. The newborn pups were {{subsequently}} <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> room <b>air</b> or SHS (5  h/day) for 1 or 14  days, and lungs were harvested. Soluble and insoluble protein fractions isolated from pediatric mice lungs {{were subjected to}} immunoblotting for ubiquitin (Ub), p 62, VCP, HIF- 1 α, and β-actin.|$|R
5|$|Mercury(II) oxide, {{the main}} oxide of mercury, arises when the metal is <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>air</b> {{for long periods}} at {{elevated}} temperatures. It reverts to the elements upon heating near 400°C, as was demonstrated by Joseph Priestley in an early synthesis of pure oxygen. Hydroxides of mercury are poorly characterized, as they are for its neighbors gold and silver.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium forms {{a number}} of oxides when <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>air,</b> {{including}} rubidium monoxide (Rb2O), Rb6O, and Rb9O2; rubidium in excess oxygen gives the superoxide RbO2. Rubidium forms salts with halides, producing rubidium fluoride, rubidium chloride, rubidium bromide, and rubidium iodide.|$|E
5|$|The metal {{takes on}} a bluish tinge when <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>air</b> at room {{temperature}} for extended periods. Despite a high melting point in elemental form (2,468°C), it has a lower density than other refractory metals. Furthermore, it is corrosion-resistant, exhibits superconductivity properties, and forms dielectric oxide layers.|$|E

50|$|Galeolaria {{build and}} live within white to grey {{calcareous}} tubes, up to 3 cm in length. These tubes {{may be found}} singly or in complex interwoven colonies, forming a distinctive zone at the mid tidal regions. They may be so thick and dense that they form a microhabitat for many other creatures. When <b>expose</b> <b>to</b> <b>air</b> at low tide, these animals retreat within their tubes.|$|R
50|$|To {{defeat the}} Blob, he once {{intentionally}} broke a web cartridge, <b>exposing</b> the fluid <b>to</b> <b>air,</b> rather than channeling it through his webshooter. By <b>exposing</b> it <b>to</b> <b>air,</b> the web fluid immediately expanded, covering the Blob {{in a large}} mass of webbing. Though expanded, it {{did not appear to}} lose any of its strength, as it was able to contain the Blob until the police arrested him.|$|R
5|$|Care {{needs to}} be taken when {{machining}} hafnium because it is pyrophoric—fine particles can spontaneously combust when <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>air.</b> Compounds that contain this metal are rarely encountered by most people. The pure metal is not considered toxic, but hafnium compounds should be handled as if they were toxic because the ionic forms of metals are normally at greatest risk for toxicity, and limited animal testing has been done for hafnium compounds.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{is one of}} a few {{metallic}} elements with {{a natural}} color other than gray or silver. Pure copper is orange-red and acquires a reddish tarnish when <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>air.</b> The characteristic color of copper results from the electronic transitions between the filled 3d and half-empty 4s atomic shells – the energy difference between these shells corresponds to orange light.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius repraesentaneus {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to Lactarius scrobiculatus, which has latex that turns yellow when <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>air,</b> a different smell, a stinging flesh and a different reaction of the milk to alkali: in L.scrobiculatus the milk turns reddish-orange while that of L.representaneus does not change color. Lactarius uvidus also has a violet reaction {{but it has a}} different color and is not hairy at the margin of the cap. L.flavidus has a yellowish cap but does not have a hairy margin.|$|E
40|$|CsI {{can be used}} as a {{photocathode}} {{material in}} UV photon detectors. The detection efficiency of the detector strongly depends on the photoemission property of the photocathode. CsI is very hygroscopic in nature. This limits the photoelectron yield from the photocathode when <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> humid <b>air</b> even for a short duration during photocathode mounting or transfer. We report here on the improvement of photoemission properties of both thick (300 nm) and thin (30 nm) UV-sensitive CsI film <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> humid <b>air</b> by the process of vacuum treatment.

5|$|Lead is a {{chemical}} element that is assigned the symbol Pb (from the Latin plumbum) and the atomic number 82. It {{is a heavy}} metal that is denser than most common materials. Lead is soft and malleable, and has a relatively low melting point. When freshly cut, lead is bluish-white; it tarnishes to a dull gray color when <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>air.</b> Lead has the highest atomic number of any stable element and concludes three major decay chains of heavier elements.|$|E
5|$|Thorium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Th and atomic number 90. Thorium metal is silvery and tarnishes black {{when it is}} <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>air,</b> forming the dioxide; it is moderately hard, malleable, and has a high melting point. Thorium is an electropositive actinide whose chemistry {{is dominated by the}} +4 oxidation state; it is quite reactive and can ignite in air when finely divided.|$|E
5|$|Authentic bird's nest soup is {{made from}} the nests of the edible-nest swiftlet (or white-nest swiftlet), Aerodramus fuciphagus, and the black-nest swiftlet, Aerodramus maximus. Instead of {{incorporating}} twigs, feathers and straw like others in the genus, these two swiftlets make their nest only from strands of their gummy saliva, which harden when <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>air.</b> Once the nests are harvested, they are cleaned and sold to restaurants. Over the past twenty years, the high demand for the nests of these Aerodramus species has had an adverse effect on their populations. The Niah caves population of black-nest swiftlets plunged from around 1.5 million pairs in 1959 to 150,000–298,000 pairs in the early 1990s through over-harvesting.|$|E

5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} fixed to a leaf {{with a special}} glue which hardens rapidly. As it hardens it contracts, {{deforming}} {{the shape of the}} egg. This glue is easily seen surrounding the base of every egg forming a meniscus. The nature of the glue has been little researched {{but in the case of}} Pieris brassicae, it begins as a pale yellow granular secretion containing acidophilic proteins. This is viscous and darkens when <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>air,</b> becoming a water-insoluble, rubbery material which soon sets solid. Butterflies in the genus Agathymus do not fix their eggs to a leaf, instead the newly laid eggs fall to the base of the plant.|$|E
5|$|Calcium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ca and atomic number 20. An alkaline earth metal, calcium is a reactive pale yellow metal that forms a dark oxide-nitride layer when <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>air.</b> Its {{physical and chemical}} properties are most similar to its heavier homologues strontium and barium. It is the fifth most abundant element in Earth's crust and the third most abundant metal, after iron and aluminium. The most common calcium compound on Earth is calcium carbonate, found in limestone and the fossilised remnants of early sea life; gypsum, anhydrite, fluorite, and apatite are also sources of calcium.|$|E
5|$|Cerium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ce and atomic number 58. Cerium is a soft, ductile and silvery-white metal that tarnishes when <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>air,</b> {{and it is}} soft enough to be cut with a knife. Cerium is the second element in the lanthanide series, and while it often shows the +3 oxidation state characteristic of the series, it also exceptionally has a stable +4 state that does not oxidize water. It is also traditionally {{considered one of the}} rare-earth elements. Cerium has no biological role and is not very toxic.|$|E

Pregnant C 57 BL/ 6 mice were <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> room <b>air</b> or SHS for 5  h/day for 14  days {{as we have}} previously described in detail [12]. After delivery, the pediatric mice were similarly <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> either room <b>air</b> or SHS for one day, and likewise, another group was <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> either conditions for 14  days. After the respective exposures, the mice were sacrificed and the pediatric lungs were harvested for further analysis by immunoblotting.|$|R
5|$|Neptunium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Np and atomic number 93. A radioactive actinide metal, neptunium {{is the first}} transuranic element. Its position in the periodic table just after uranium, named after the planet Uranus, led to it being named after Neptune, the next planet beyond Uranus. A neptunium atom has 93 protons and 93 electrons, of which seven are valence electrons. Neptunium metal is silvery and tarnishes when <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>air.</b> The element occurs in three allotropic forms and it normally exhibits five oxidation states, ranging from +3 to +7. It is radioactive, poisonous, pyrophoric, and can accumulate in bones, which makes the handling of neptunium dangerous.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium is a {{transuranic}} radioactive {{chemical element}} with symbol Pu and atomic number 94. It is an actinide metal of silvery-gray appearance that tarnishes when <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>air,</b> and forms a dull coating when oxidized. The element normally exhibits six allotropes and four oxidation states. It reacts with carbon, halogens, nitrogen, silicon and hydrogen. When exposed to moist air, it forms oxides and hydrides that can expand the sample up to 70% in volume, {{which in turn}} flake off as a powder that is pyrophoric. It is radioactive and can accumulate in bones, which makes the handling of plutonium dangerous.|$|E
5|$|Thallium is {{malleable}} and sectile {{enough to}} be cut with a knife at room temperature. It has a metallic luster that, when <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>air,</b> quickly tarnishes to a bluish-gray tinge, resembling lead. It may be preserved by immersion in oil. A heavy layer of oxide builds up on thallium if left in air. In the presence of water, thallium hydroxide is formed. Sulfuric and nitric acid dissolve thallium rapidly to make the sulfate and nitrate salts, while hydrochloric acid forms an insoluble thallium(I) chloride layer.|$|E
