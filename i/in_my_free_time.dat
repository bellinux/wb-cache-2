Grimm may not stack up character moments like its genre show peers, but when it does decide to give you a peek behind the curtain, it's usually a whole lot of fun, as evidenced by last night's episode that gave just about everybody a moment or two to just be themselves." ...|$|E

40|$|In the end {{phases of}} an urban design course that was {{oriented}} towards children, it dawned on me: the shocking realization {{that we are talking}} about play as something that is only significant for children. How could it be that we are talking about playgrounds that adults have no business in. Not that children don’t require specific attention, seeing that they are the future of our world, but what I experienced was quite the epiphany. I started wondering why playfulness isn’t discussed in our studies as a quality? Why isn’t play an important activity of adult life? Personally, all I do <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>free</b> <b>time</b> is play. I do all the things I don’t like doing for the sake of play. I play board games, computer games, football. I am exremely playful when I hang out with my friends as I joke around and talk about unserious matters. When I walk in the city I play with it. I do not walk for health reasons, I walk because I like walking for walking’s sake. I watch people for watching’s sake and I have coffee {{for the sake of a}} nice conversation. Such a big part of our lives deserves some attention, I thought. I started looking into urban design studies and found almost none that brought up play. As I was reading more, cities started looking alarmingly similar and serious. Public spaces, the areas in our cities that have the potential to be the adult playgrounds, began to feel more and more deserted. Slowly, I got increasingly convinced that play as a subject was worth studying. However, it quickly seemed like a difficult angle to approach public space design. Its definition was tricky and people I talked to associated it with children at the first chance. Regardless, in hopes of gaining a fresh perspective, something I felt the field of urban design sorely needed, I foolishly pushed onwards. The result is a short introduction to playful urban design – a merger between playtheory and urban studies...|$|E
40|$|Research focus Control of {{autophagy}} {{during both}} physiological development and in stress {{conditions in the}} sea urchin embryo. Model system Sea urchin embryo and larvae in development. Education and career 1971, biology degree, University of Palermo, Italy; advisor: G. Giudice. 1972 – 1973, fellowship from the Italian Ministry of Public Education, Institute of Comparative Anatomy, University of Palermo. 1974 – 1980, associate scientist at the Institute of Comparative Anatomy, University of Palermo. 1981 – 2005, associate professor of cell biology, Department of Cell and Development Biology, University of Palermo. 2000 – 2005, member of the scientific committee for PhD in “Biotechnology applied to prenatal medicine. ” 2006 –present, full professor of cell biology, in the Department of Molecular and Biomolecular Sciences and Technologies (STEMBIO) Section of Cell Biology, University of Palermo; 1995 -present, member of the scientific committee for PhD in “Cell Biology and Drugs Technology” (Cell Biology). 2000 – 2003 and 2008 –present, vice-head of the School of Natural Sciences. Why do you study autophagy? My interest in autophagy is to understand how autophagy contributes to cell differentiation {{in the development of}} embryos {{as well as to the}} ability of embryos to defend themselves against environmental stresses, including the remodeling of an alternative phenotype. I recently observed that autophagosomes/ autolysosomes are present in different numbers depending on the stage of development, but increase greatly under stress. Furthermore, my interest is to recognize the molecular pathways that, both during physiological development and in stress conditions, the embryo uses. I am also interested in investigating the relationship between autophagy and the apoptotic process, because in sea urchin embryos, apoptosis is used to remove irreversibly damaged cells as a response to stress. In addition, I am extending my research on autophagy and apoptosis in human granulosa cells and cumulus oophorus, as part of medicalassisted reproduction, in order to select the best corresponding oocyte, for fertilization. What do you think is a key question in the autophagy field? Autophagy is a process that enables the cell to choose to live or die. The main goal would be to understand the molecular pathways through which this process regulates survival or death, in order to use this ability to tip the balance one way or another. In this way we could push the cell toward survival in the case of excessive cell death, as in aging, or vice versa push toward death, as in tumorigenesis. Is teaching a substantial part of your current position? As a professor of cell biology at the university, I explain the main processes involving the cell, including apoptosis and autophagy. The research that I discuss certainly makes the content of my lectures more interesting and at the same time students are a good stimulus because they always ask new questions. In addition, this year, I was tutor of a doctoral thesis of a subject about the autophagic process in sea urchin embryos exposed to stress.

30|$|From {{previous}} studies on casual contributors [14] and quasi-contributors [19], {{we found out}} that the main reason for a developer to place a contribution to a project is to “scratch his/her own itch.” In many cases, this motivation was triggered by the company where the developer worked. We hypothesize that this can be the case for many contributors to these company-owned projects. Interestingly, we found cases in which developers voluntarily contribute, for a long period. It is the case of one of the top 10 contributors of atom, who, in his personal home page, mention that “In <b>my</b> <b>free</b> <b>time</b> I contribute to Atom, GitHub’s text editor, as one of the community maintainers of the project.” We found similar when analyzing the top contributors of git-lfs and electron.

I collected my set nearby tweets by saving the first handful of nearby tweets every time I posted a tweet of my own, wherever I was in the city. This allowed me to gather a database consisting of voices from all around the city, each contributing to the collective portrait I was hoping to draw. Twitter and the streets of New York City are similar in nature, both full of strangers and dialogue with little or no context. By examining the whole collective voice, however, I worked to overcome the lack of context and to draw a picture of life in the city as it was in early 2014. While living in New York City I worked at a high-tech startup and spent <b>my</b> <b>free</b> <b>time</b> mostly with educated foreigners or people in the arts—all in close proximity to other New Yorkers whose lives are radically different.
