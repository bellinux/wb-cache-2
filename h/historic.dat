5|$|A <b>historic</b> {{preservation}} {{movement in}} Omaha {{has led to}} a number of <b>historic</b> structures and districts being designated Omaha Landmarks or listed on the National Register of <b>Historic</b> Places. Much of the push toward preservation came after Omaha gained the notorious designation of having, in 1989, demolished the largest-ever National Register <b>historic</b> district in the United States, a record that still stands as of 2013. The Jobbers Canyon <b>Historic</b> District, along the Missouri River, was felled for a new headquarters campus for ConAgra Foods, a company which threatened to relocate if Omaha did not allow them to raze the city's <b>historic</b> district. The Jobber's Canyon warehouses had before then been allowed to deteriorate and were the scene of several fires set by the homeless population that had come to live in the abandoned buildings. At the time, there were no plans in place for revitalizing the buildings.|$|E
5|$|After {{surveys of}} <b>historic</b> {{properties}} in the county, in 2008 the Hampshire County <b>Historic</b> Landmarks Commission and the Hampshire County Commission began an initiative to place structures and districts on the National Register of <b>Historic</b> Places. The county received funding from the State <b>Historic</b> Preservation Office of the West Virginia Division of Culture and History to survey and document its architecture and history. As {{a result of this}} initiative, Valley View {{was one of the first}} eight <b>historic</b> properties to be considered for placement on the register. The other seven were Capon Chapel, Fort Kuykendall, Hickory Grove, Hook Tavern, North River Mills <b>Historic</b> District, Old Pine Church and Springfield Brick House. The house at Valley View was listed on the NRHP on December12, 2012.|$|E
5|$|Amarillo's <b>historic</b> {{homes and}} {{buildings}} {{listed on the}} National Register of <b>Historic</b> Places reflect the economic growth from around 1900 {{to the start of}} World War II. Polk Street contains many of the city's <b>historic</b> downtown buildings and homes. The large <b>historic</b> homes on this street were built close to downtown, and homes were located {{on the west side of}} the street as a symbol of status because they would be greeted with the sunrise every morning.|$|E
5|$|As a result, the Riverside <b>Historic</b> District, Jacksonville's first <b>historic</b> district, {{was added}} to the National Register of <b>Historic</b> Places in 1985; it now {{comprises}} 6870 acres and contains 2120 <b>historic</b> buildings. In 1989, the Avondale <b>Historic</b> District was added, and the following year the Jacksonville City Council established the Jacksonville <b>Historic</b> Preservation Commission in order to protect <b>historic</b> structures. Riverside Avondale Preservation has grown into one of the largest such organizations in the country. As a result of this focus on preservation and planning, the American Planning Association named Riverside and Avondale one of the country's top ten neighborhoods in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Clwyd {{consists}} of {{the whole of the}} <b>historic</b> county of Flintshire, and most of Denbighshire. Since 2003 it has also included the former district of Aberconwy, which lies in the <b>historic</b> county of Caernarfonshire, and also Edeyrnion Rural District which was previously part of the <b>historic</b> county of Merionethshire.|$|E
5|$|Eight <b>Historic</b> Landmarks in Indiana {{are more}} {{specifically}} designated National <b>Historic</b> Landmark Districts, {{meaning that they}} cover a large area rather than a single building. The Lanier Mansion and Charles L. Shrewsbury House are {{within the boundaries of}} the Madison <b>Historic</b> District.|$|E
5|$|Farmers {{markets in}} the area, {{including}} the Nassau Bay Farmers Market and the Farmers Market at Clear Lake Shores, provide opportunities for area residents to connect with local growers, producers, and other businesses. <b>Historic</b> districts such as the Goose Creek <b>Historic</b> District (Baytown), the Morgan's Point <b>Historic</b> District, and the League City <b>Historic</b> District are available providing views of early area architecture in addition to unique shopping venues.|$|E
5|$|Four <b>historic</b> {{sites in}} the state are managed by the National Park Service. One of these, the Tuskegee Institute National <b>Historic</b> Site, is also {{designated}} a NHL. The others are Horseshoe Bend National Military Park, Russell Cave National Monument, and Tuskegee Airmen National <b>Historic</b> Site.|$|E
5|$|Galveston {{is home to}} six <b>historic</b> {{districts with}} over 60 {{structures}} listed representing architectural significance in the National Register of <b>Historic</b> Places.

The East End <b>Historic</b> District {{on both sides of}} Broadway and Market Streets, contains 463 buildings. Other <b>historic</b> districts include Cedar Lawn, Denver Court and Fort Travis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Historic</b> Lifeboat Collection in Chatham <b>Historic</b> Dockyard with 17 <b>historic</b> vessels.|$|E
5|$|<b>Historic</b> {{districts are}} {{generally}} {{two types of}} properties, contributing and non-contributing. Broadly defined, a contributing property is any property, structure or object which adds to the historical integrity or architectural qualities that make a <b>historic</b> district, listed locally or federally, significant. Different entities, usually governmental, at {{both the state and}} national level in the United States, have differing definitions of contributing property but they all retain the same basic characteristics. In general, contributing properties are integral parts of the <b>historic</b> context and character of a <b>historic</b> district.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, the {{waterfront}} area {{was among the}} earliest National <b>Historic</b> Landmarks designated by the Secretary of the Interior. Five years later, in 1971, WHALE succeeded in getting today's <b>historic</b> district designated as the Bedford Landing Waterfront <b>Historic</b> District. The city later enacted zoning regulations to preserve its character.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, the church, rectory, {{and schools}} were {{recorded}} by a <b>historic</b> preservation program {{run by the}} Ohio Historical Society, known as the Ohio <b>Historic</b> Inventory. This survey found the church in excellent condition, the elementary school in fair condition, and {{the high school and}} rectory in good condition. Although no <b>historic</b> preservation program was in effect, no threats to <b>historic</b> integrity were identified for any of the buildings, except for the elementary school, which was deemed to be in danger from being outdated.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, three {{separate}} <b>historic</b> districts incorporating the existing CCC structures in Black Moshannon State Park {{were placed on}} the National Register of <b>Historic</b> Places. The structures in all three districts were built between 1933and 1937and are designated as part of either the Beach and Day Use, Family Cabin, or Maintenance <b>Historic</b> Districts.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, the Barlow Road {{was placed}} on the National Register of <b>Historic</b> Places as a <b>historic</b> district.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, the Webster Sycamore {{was one of}} five trees {{nominated}} by the West Virginia Humanities Council to the National Register of <b>Historic</b> Trees, a registry of <b>historic</b> trees maintained by the American Forests <b>Historic</b> Tree Nursery.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s The Beeches {{and a large}} part of the grounds were sold for the {{establishment}} of St. Brendan's Sixth Form College. The grounds, which are Grade II* listed on the Register of <b>Historic</b> Parks and Gardens of special <b>historic</b> interest in England, are now on the Heritage at Risk register of <b>Historic</b> England.|$|E
5|$|Local <b>historic</b> districts usually {{enjoy the}} {{greatest}} {{level of protection}} legally from any threats that may compromise their <b>historic</b> integrity because many land-use decisions are made at the local level. There are more than 2,300 local <b>historic</b> districts in the United States. Local <b>historic</b> districts can be administered at the county or the municipal level; both entities are involved in land use decisions.|$|E
5|$|Omaha is home {{to dozens}} of nationally, {{regionally}} and locally significant landmarks. The city {{has more than a}} dozen <b>historic</b> districts, including Fort Omaha <b>Historic</b> District, Gold Coast <b>Historic</b> District, Omaha Quartermaster Depot <b>Historic</b> District, Field Club <b>Historic</b> District, Bemis Park <b>Historic</b> District, and the South Omaha Main Street <b>Historic</b> District. Omaha is notorious for its 1989 demolition of 24 buildings in the Jobbers Canyon <b>Historic</b> District, which represents to date the largest loss of buildings on the National Register. The only original building surviving of that complex is the Nash Block.|$|E
5|$|On May 29, 1998, the Blackstone Hotel was {{designated}} as a Chicago Landmark. The hotel {{was added to the}} National Register of <b>Historic</b> Places on May 8, 1986. It is also a <b>historic</b> district contributing property for the Chicago Landmark <b>Historic</b> Michigan Boulevard District.|$|E
5|$|On October 15, 1966, the <b>Historic</b> Preservation Act {{created the}} National Register of <b>Historic</b> Places and the {{corresponding}} State <b>Historic</b> Preservation Offices (SHPO). Initially, the National Register consisted of the National <b>Historic</b> Landmarks designated before the Register's creation, {{as well as any}} other <b>historic</b> sites in the National Park system. Approval of the act, which was amended in 1980 and 1992, represented the first time the United States had a broad-based <b>historic</b> preservation policy. The 1966 act required those agencies to work in conjunction with the SHPO and an independent federal agency, the Advisory Council on <b>Historic</b> Preservation (ACHP), to confront adverse effects of federal activities on <b>historic</b> preservation.|$|E
5|$|Owners of income-producing {{properties}} listed individually in the National Register of <b>Historic</b> Places or {{of properties}} that are contributing resources within a National Register <b>Historic</b> District may {{be eligible for}} a 20% investment tax credit for the rehabilitation of the <b>historic</b> structure. The rehabilitation may be of a commercial, industrial, or residential property, for rentals. The tax incentives program is operated by the Federal <b>Historic</b> Preservation Tax Incentives program, which is managed jointly by the National Park Service, individual State <b>Historic</b> Preservation Offices, and the Internal Revenue Service. Aside from the 20% tax credit, the tax incentive program offers a 10% tax credit for rehabilitation to owners of non-historic, non-residential buildings constructed before 1936.|$|E
5|$|Seven bridges {{along the}} US41 {{corridor}} {{have been recognized}} for their <b>historic</b> character by various organizations.

5|$|The 1966 National <b>Historic</b> Preservation Act, {{which created}} the National Register of <b>Historic</b> Places, {{empowered}} individual states to create review boards to function {{with the state}} historical preservation officer. Illinois did not create its <b>historic</b> preservation program until the early 1970s, {{under the direction of}} the Illinois Department of Conservation. The Department of Conservation dispatched field surveyors to all Illinois counties to find anything that might qualify for inclusion on the National Register of <b>Historic</b> Places.|$|E
5|$|The Broadway Hollywood Building is a {{contributing}} property to the National Register of <b>Historic</b> Places U.S. <b>Historic</b> District-listed Hollywood Boulevard Commercial and Entertainment District. It has been listed as both a <b>historic</b> district contributing property and individually registered <b>historic</b> property {{by the city of}} Los Angeles and the state of California. The building has a neon sign above it that is considered notable and <b>historic.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Nathaniel Backus House was {{submitted}} to the National Register of <b>Historic</b> Places for its historical value in local history and {{as an example of}} Greek Revival domestic architecture. It was listed on the National Register of <b>Historic</b> Places (NRHP) in 1970 and was also included in the NRHP's Chelsea Parade <b>Historic</b> District designation in 1989.|$|E
5|$|The National Park Service {{administers the}} {{national}} <b>historic</b> sites, {{with the exception}} of Grey Towers National <b>Historic</b> Site (managed by the U.S. Forest Service) and Fort Craig National <b>Historic</b> Site (managed by the Bureau of Land Management).|$|E
5|$|The RNLI Heritage Trust's {{collection}} of <b>historic</b> items at its HQ in Poole, including fine art, model lifeboats, and an archive of <b>historic</b> documents and photographs.|$|E
5|$|The Railroad Addition <b>Historic</b> District {{was added}} to the National Register of <b>Historic</b> Places in 1983.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. federal {{government}} designates <b>historic</b> districts through the United States Department of Interior {{under the auspices}} of the National Park Service. Federally designated <b>historic</b> districts are listed on the National Register of <b>Historic</b> Places, but listing usually imposes no restrictions on what property owners may do with a designated property. State-level <b>historic</b> districts may follow similar criteria (no restrictions) or may require adherence to certain <b>historic</b> rehabilitation standards. Local <b>historic</b> district designation offers, by far, the most legal protection for <b>historic</b> properties because most land use decisions are made at the local level. Local districts are generally administered by the county or municipal government.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of I-280 destroyed {{a large part}} of the <b>historic</b> urban cores of Orange, East Orange, and Newark. The Interstate passed through the <b>historic</b> downtown cores of East Orange and Orange, and many commercial buildings and <b>historic</b> Victorian homes were demolished in the process.|$|E
