40|$|Veterinary Needs Appraisals have {{indicated}} {{that there is a}} need for improved supply of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> to subsistence and emerging farmers in South Africa. No studies have been conducted to describe and assess the adequacy of the current routes and methods of supply of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> to these farmers. A combination of focus groups, self-administered questionnaires and direct observations was used to collect information for the purpose of describing and understanding the situation regarding the supply of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> to the farmers of the Madikwe district. A combination of semi-structured interviews, questionnaires and direct observation was used to gather information. The results indicated that the routes and methods of supply of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> to the farmers of the Madikwe district were inadequate. The annual sales from outlets within the Madikwe district were poor, with a total of 396 units sold over a period of one year, although there were approximately 2000 farmers in the Madikwe district who were potential clients for these outlets. The majority of products sold by these outlets were ectoparasiticides, followed by Tetracycline antibiotics. The outlets within the Madikwe district were unable to supply vaccines, as they did not have adequate facilities for the storage of these thermolabile products. Farmers had to travel an average of 70 km if they wished to purchase <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> from farmers' co-operatives and pharmacies in larger towns outside the Madikwe district. The routes and methods of supply did not ensure correct storage, and safe and effective use of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Several examples of misuse and incorrect storage and handling of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> were discovered. Inadequate information transfer, inaccessibility of outlets, poor reliability and quality of outlets and poor service were discovered as reasons for the inadequacy of the routes and methods of supply.

40|$|Summary: The main {{consequences}} for the <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> sector of the recent wave of liberalisation in Africa’s livestock sector have been a proliferation of operators, a diversification of product origin and a general decline in product quality. In this context, all the stakeholders involved agree that legislation on <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> needs to be harmonised among the African countries. Despite this consensus, however, the situation has not changed much in the countries themselves. In order to explore operational guidelines for harmonising national legislation in Africa, with particular reference to the registration and quality control of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) drew up a status report on the member countries of the OIE Regional Commission for Africa based on the answers to a questionnaire.

40|$|In Germany and Europe <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> {{are subject}} to strict {{regulatory}} requirements. As part of the authorisation procedure, active substances are investigated in regard to their effects on humans, animals and the environment. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) for humans of each active substance is derived {{on the basis of}} scientific studies. The ADI serves to determine maximum residue levels (MRL) for foodstuff of animal origin (meat, kidney, fat, milk, eggs and honey). The MRL are determined so that the daily intake of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> residues up to these levels is not expected to endanger the health of the consumer. In light of the discovery that plants are able to take up <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> residues from soil, the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) carried out an expert panel in December 2009. The aim of the panel was to reveal the current state of scientific knowledge on the potential carry-over of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> residues in foods of plant origin and its effects. It was determined that results from model experiments and modelling have provided initial indications for the behaviour of some active substances and their metabolites (transformation products) in slurry, in soil and in the plant.

Current guidance, e.g., the “guideline on determining the fate of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in manure” [19], takes transformation of VMPs and biocides in manure into account. However, there is no standardized experimental test protocol available to examine the transformation of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (VMPs) and biocides in liquid manure. The EMA guideline on transformation in manure [19] only contains basic regulatory requirements.

40|$|A {{ranking system}} for <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and {{medicated}} feed additives {{has been developed}} {{as a tool to}} be applied in a risk-based approach to the residue testing programme for foods of animal origin in the National Residue Control Plan. In the context of food sampling and residue testing for the National Residue Control Plan, there is firstly, the risk to human health from residues of chemical substances in food and secondly, the issue of non-compliance with regulations relating to residues in food due to improper farm practices; both these elements are included in the developed risk-ranking of substances. Three characteristics of substances that may occur as residues in food are included in the developed risk-ranking system: ‘Potency’, as measured by the acceptable daily intake value assigned to each substance; ‘Usage’, as measured by the three factors of number of doses, use on individual animals or for group treatment, and withdrawal period; ‘Residue Occurrence’, as measured by non-compliant samples in the National Residue Control Plan. The risk-ranking system for substances has been developed using a scoring system applied to the various parameters to give an overall score. It is a relatively simple system, designed to provide a basis for selecting the <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and medicated feed additives that might be prioritised for residue testing. However, a number of limitations are associated with the system and this risk-ranking of substances represents only one component of a total risk-based approach to designing the residue testing programme. Other factors which should be taken into account include issues such as evidence of misuse of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and medicated feed additives and changes to maximum residue limits in the specifications for particular <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and medicated feed additives.

40|$|The {{spread of}} <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (VMP) and {{biocides}} onto agriculturally used areas represents {{a very important}} path of entry into the environment for these product groups. For this reason, current guidance (e. g. "Guideline on determining the fate of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in manure" (EMA/CVMP/ERA/ 430327 / 2009) (EMA, 2011) stipulates experimental studies on transformation of VMPs and biocides in manure. Though, the documents only contain basic regulatory requirements, whereas an experimental test guideline is still missing, both on EU and OECD level. To allow for a consistent assessment of studies within the registration process, a harmonized internationally accepted and validated test method is needed. A draft test guideline was developed within a previous R&D-Project "Development of test guidance for transformation of veterinary pharmaceuticals and biocides in liquid manure" (FKZ 3710 67 422) (Hennecke et al., 2015).

The authors compared the abundance of earthworms and springtails in soil beneath dung from untreated cattle and from cattle treated 0 [*]d, 3 [*]d, 7 [*]d, 14 [*]d, and 28 [*]d previously with ivermectin. Study sites were located in different ecoregions in Switzerland (Continental), The Netherlands (Atlantic), France (Mediterranean), and Canada (Northern Mixed Grassland). Samples were collected using standard methods from 1 mo to 12 [*]mo after pat deposition. Ivermectin concentrations in soil beneath dung pats ranged from 0. 02 [*]mg/kg dry weight (3 [*]mo) to typically < 0. 006 [*]mg/kg dry weight (5 – 7 [*]mo). Earthworms were abundant and species-rich at the Swiss and Dutch sites, less common with fewer species at the French site, and essentially absent at the Canadian site. Diverse but highly variable communities of springtails were present at all sites. Overall, results showed little effect of residues on either earthworms or springtails.

40|$|By {{degrading}} the dung {{of livestock}} that graze on pastures, coprophilous arthropods accelerate the cycling of nutrients to maintain pasture quality. Many <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> such as ivermectin, are excreted unchanged in the dung of treated livestock.

It is argued that the experience obtained by pesticide research largely can be used when evaluating VMPs, although there are several major differences between pesticides and pharmaceuticals (e. g., knowledge of their mechanisms of action on nontarget organisms). Also, because microorganisms are often the target organisms of VMPs, risk assessment should focus more on endpoints describing functional processes.

So far, only regulatory guidance (Guideline on determining the fate of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in manure (EMA/CVMP/ERA/ 430327 / 2009 (revised in 2011)) addresses this issue. However, an experimental guidance is still missing as it is available in form of OECD test guidelines for testing fate in soils and water-/sediment systems. It was the aim of the project to develop a method to determine the transformation of substances in liquid manure. In a first step, the heterogeneity of manure of different type and origin was tested. Furthermore, a procedure was tested which is capable to take samples homogeneously from a manure storage tank. Obviously, representative sampling is possible in case mixing devices which are routinely applied by the farmers are used prior to sampling. In order to get an overview on the variability of liquid manure of different type and origin (pig-/cattle manure; manure sampled in summer and winter, from different regions and livestock breeding) 30 manures were sampled and characterized.

However, while the prevalence of veterinary drug residues in foods of animal origin is less than 1 % in Europe, in some African countries it can be as high as 94 %. Antimicrobial residues in foods of animal origin can cause allergies, cancer, alterations in the intestinal flora, bacterial resistance and the inhibition of fermentation in the dairy industry.
