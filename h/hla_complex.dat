In this study, we show that human pDCs, although inefficient in the internalization of cell membrane fragments by phagocytosis, can efficiently acquire membrane patches and associated molecules from cancer cells of different histotypes. The transfer of membrane patches to pDCs occurred {{in a very short time}} and required cell-to-cell contact. Membrane transfer also included intact <b>HLA</b> <b>complexes,</b> and the acquired Ags could be efficiently recognized on pDCs by tumor-specific CD 8 (+) T cells.

These data demonstrate that pDCs are well suited to acquire membrane patches from contiguous tumor cells by a cell-to-cell contact-dependent mechanism that closely resembles "trogocytosis.

40|$|Simple T cell assays {{specific}} for any chosen HLA class I {{or class}} II/peptide combination, are of enormous value in cancer immunotherapy, clinical trials, vaccine and infectious disease research. The reliable measurement of T cell activity {{can be difficult}} due {{to the presence of}} other alleles on target cells, particularly for the non-HLA-A 2 alleles, and the varying baseline characteristics of the different APCs employed. In the absence of pulsing with HLA-A 2 restricted peptides, T 2 cells are functionally HLA class I and II negative. By coating these cells with recombinant <b>HLA</b> peptide <b>complexes,</b> <b>HLA</b> mono-specific cells are produced that present only a defined single epitope, and generate minimal background immune activation. In ELISPOT, intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) and killing assays using T cells specific for HLA-A 2 /peptide <b>complexes,</b> the <b>HLA</b> mono-specific cells gave comparable results, to those using standard peptide pulsed HLA-A 2 positive T 2 cells without significant background.

The data, obtained with ELISPOT, ICS and FACS-based killing assays, all demonstrate high specificity of T cell activity and low levels of background activity. HLA mono-specific cells are simple to prepare, and can be used with any stable recombinant HLA allele/peptide combination; providing a useful system for improved T cell functional analyses across all HLA allotypes.

40|$|The {{remarkable}} clinical {{efficacy of}} the immune checkpoint blockade therapies has motivated researchers to discover immunogenic epitopes and exploit them for personalized vaccines. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -binding peptides derived from processing and presentation of mutated proteins {{are one of the}} leading targets for T-cell recognition of cancer cells. Currently, most studies attempt to identify neoantigens based on predicted affinity to HLA molecules, but the performance of such prediction algorithms is rather poor for rare HLA class I alleles and for HLA class II. Direct identification of neoantigens by mass spectrometry (MS) is becoming feasible; however, it is not yet applicable to most patients and lacks sensitivity. In an attempt to capitalize on existing immunopeptidomics data and extract information that could complement HLA-binding prediction, we first compiled a large HLA class I and class II immunopeptidomics database across dozens of cell types and HLA allotypes and detected hotspots that are subsequences of proteins frequently presented. About 3 % of the peptidome was detected in both class I and class II. Based on the gene ontology of their source proteins and the peptide’s length, we propose that their processing may partake by the cellular class II presentation machinery. Our database captures the global nature of the in vivo peptidome averaged over many HLA alleles, and therefore, reflects the propensity of peptides to be presented on <b>HLA</b> <b>complexes,</b> which is complementary to the existing neoantigen prediction features such as binding affinity and stability or RNA abundance. We further introduce two immunopeptidomics MS-based features to guide prioritization of neoantigens: the number of peptides matching a protein in our database and the overlap of the predicted wild-type peptide with other peptides in our database. We show as a proof of concept that our immunopeptidomics MS-based features improved neoantigen prioritization by up to 50 %. Overall, our work shows that, in addition to providing huge training data to improve the HLA binding prediction, immunopeptidomics also captures other aspects of the natural in vivo presentation that significantly improve prediction of clinically relevant neoantigens...|$|R
