40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in {{conjunction}} with Universities Space Research Association (USRA) has requested that the feasibility of a fleet of regolith tossing devices designed to cover a lunar habitat for radiation protection be demonstrated. The regolith, or lunar soil, protects the lunar habitat and its inhabitants from radiation. Ideally, the device will operate autonomously in the lunar environment. To prove the feasibility of throwing regolith on the Moon, throwing solutions were compared to traditional, Earth-based methods for moving soil. Various throwing configurations were investigated. A linear throwing motion combined with a spring and motor <b>energizing</b> <b>system</b> proved a superior solution. Three different overall configurations for the lunar device are presented. A single configuration is chosen and critical parameters such as operating procedure, system volume, mass, and power are developed. The report is divided into seven main sections. First, the Introduction section gives background information, defines the project requirements and the design criteria, and presents the methodology used for the completion of this design. Next, the Preliminary Analysis section presents background information on characteristics of lunar habitats and the lunar environment. Then, the Alternate Designs section presents alternate solutions {{to each of the}} critical functions of the device. Fourth, a detailed analysis of throwing the regolith is done to demonstrate its feasibility. Then, the three overall design configurations are presented. Next, a configuration is selected and the conceptual design is expanded to include system performance characteristics, size, and mass. Finally, the Conclusions and Recommendations for Future Work section evaluates the design, outlines the next step to be taken in the design process, and suggests possible goals for future design work...|$|E

40|$|Some {{characteristics}} of the energized uptake of safranine by rat heart mitochondria were studied. When monitored by changes in differential absorbance (between 524 and 554 nm) of a whole suspension in safranine-containing medium, the changes seen are not linearly related to the quantity of the safranine moving. It happens coincidentally that the changes observed are nearly linearly related to the logarithm of the ratio between the accumulated safranine and its residual concentration in the medium; this explains why the changes of absorbance have been found by other authors to be linearly related to the logarithms of the ratio of internal/external concentrations of such other cations as are permeable. The uptake process appears to compete for energy with Ca 2 + uptake and vice versa. Energized safranine uptake has an anion requirement, which is seen when movement of endogenous Pi has been inhibited; the small residual safranine uptake obtained when energy is provided {{in the presence of}} mersalyl may be attributable to internal Pi. However, a limited anion-independent energized uptake of safranine, in exchange for internal K+, may be elicited in the presence of nigericin.

All ΔG values were calculated at 298 K. (1) PhO(CH 2) 2 O− effects an ipso Smiles rearrangement (ΔGr = + 35 kJ mol− 1; barrier to transition state ΔG# = + 40 kJ mol− 1) equilibrating the two oxygen atoms. The Smiles intermediate reverts to PhO(CH 2) 2 O− which then undergoes an SNi reaction to form PhO− and ethylene oxide (ΔGr = − 24 kJ mol− 1; ΔG# = + 54 kJ mol− 1). (2) The formation of PhO− from energized PhO(CH 2) 3 O− is more complex. Some 85 % of the PhO− formed originates via a Smiles intermediate (ΔGr = + 52 kJ mol− 1; ΔG# = + 61 kJ mol− 1). This species reconverts to PhO(CH 2) 3 O− which then fragments to PhO− by two competing processes, namely, (a) an SNi process yielding PhO− and trimethylene oxide (ΔGr = − 27 kJ mol− 1; ΔG# = + 69 kJ mol− 1), and (b) a dissociation process giving PhO−, ethylene and formaldehyde (ΔGr = − 65 kJ mol− 1; ΔG# = + 69 kJ mol− 1). The other fifteen percent of PhO− is formed prior to formation of the Smiles intermediate, occurring directly by the SNi and dissociation processes outlined above.

40|$|Diode {{junction}} photovoltaic (PV) generators exhibit nonlinear V-I {{characteristics and}} the maximum power extractable {{varies with the}} intensity of solar radiation, temperature and load conditions. A {{maximum power point tracking}} (MPPT) controller is therefore usually employed in PV-generator applications to automatically extract maximum power irrespective of the instantaneous conditions of the PV system.

40|$|In {{photovoltaic}} (PV) {{water pumping}} systems, a {{maximum power point}} tracking (MPPT) controller is extremely important. Since PV generators exhibit nonlinear I-V characteristics and their maximum power point varies with solar insolation. Therefore, the MPPT controller optimises the solar energy conversion by ensuring that the PV generator runs at the maximum power point at all times under different illumination conditions. In this paper, a new artificial neural network (ANN) based searching algorithm is proposed for {{maximum power point tracking}} (MPPT). The system is composed of solar array, buck converter and centrifugal pump load driven by a permanent magnet DC motor. The proposed ANN controller uses the output power of the PV generator and speed of the DC motor as input signals and generates the pulse width modulation (PWM) control signal to adjust the operating duty ratio of a buck converter to match the load impedance to the internal impedance of the PV array; thus maximizing the motor speed and the water discharge rate of a centrifugal pump. A complete dynamic simulation of the system is developed in MATLAB/SIMULINK to demonstrate the feasibility of the ANN control scheme under different sunlight insolation levels. The results obtained verify that the proposed ANN controller shows a significant improvement in the power extraction performance under different sunlight conditions, when compared with a directly-connected PV generator <b>energized</b> pumping <b>system.</b> Moreover, the simulation results match the calculated improvement...|$|R

40|$|Certain {{inflation}} models undergo pre-heating, {{in which}} inflaton oscillations can drive parametric resonance instabilities. We discuss several phenomena stemming from such instabilities, especially in weak-scale models; generically, these involve <b>energizing</b> a resonant <b>system</b> {{so that it}} can evade tunneling by crossing barriers classically. One possibility is a spontaneous change of phase from a lower-energy vacuum state to one of higher energy, as exemplified by an asymmetric double-well potential with different masses in each well. If the lower well is in resonance with oscillations of the potential, a system can be driven resonantly to the upper well and stay there (except for tunneling) if the upper well is not resonant. Another example occurs in hybrid inflation models where the Higgs field is resonant; the Higgs oscillations can be transferred to electroweak (EW) gauge potentials, leading to rapid transitions over sphaleron barriers and consequent B+L violation. Given an appropriate CP-violating seed, we find that preheating can drive a time-varying condensate of Chern-Simons number over large spatial scales; this condensate evolves by oscillation as well as decay into modes with shorter spatial gradients, eventually ending up as a condensate of sphalerons. We study these examples numerically and to some extent analytically. The emphasis in the present paper is on the generic mechanisms, and not on specific preheating models; these will be discussed in a later paper.

Integral cytoplasmic membrane proteins ExbB and ExbD appear to harvest PMF and transduce it to TonB. The carboxy terminus of TonB then physically interacts with outer membrane transporters to allow translocation of ligands into the periplasmic space. The structure of the TonB carboxy terminus (residues ~ 150 to 239) has been solved several times with similar results. Our previous results hinted that in vitro structures might not mimic the dimeric conformations that characterize TonB in vivo. To test structural predictions and to identify irreplaceable residues, the entire carboxy terminus of TonB was scanned with Cys substitutions. TonB I 232 C and N 233 C, predicted to efficiently form disulfide-linked dimers in the crystal structures, did not do so.

However, they also are skeptical and concerned about the security, trust and privacy issues related to its adoption. In this study we identify the roles of security and trust in cloud computing environments from the perspective of organizations who would entrust their private information to the cloud computing providers. We compare cloud computing and banking since to both security and trust is of vital importance for their service users and providers. For any new technology such as cloud computing trust is not easily established, it gradually builds based on providers’ reputation for good performance and security, earning users’ trust over time. The clients must trust the cloud providers just like {{they would be willing to}} trust banks to put their money into them. Similarly, the cloud providers must demonstrate that they are reliable and trustworthy. Therefore for widespread adoption of cloud computing, we contend that customers should be able to store their data in the cloud with same confidence as they store their money and other valuables in the banks today. To help study and address the roles of security and trust further, we provide technological, regulatory, and behavioral recommendations for consideration...|$|R
40|$|Optimization {{techniques}} are widely applied in various engineering areas, such as modeling, identi�cation, optimization, prediction, forecasting {{and control of}} complex systems. This thesis presents the novel optimization methods {{that are used to}} control Photovoltaic (PV) generation systems. PV power systems are electrical power <b>systems</b> <b>energized</b> by PV modules or cells. This thesis starts with the introduction of PV modeling methods, on which our research is based. Parameter estimation is used to extract the parameters of the PV models characterizing the utilized PV devices. To improve e�ciency and accuracy, we proposed sequential Cuckoo Search (CS) and Parallel Particle Swarm Optimization (PPSO) methods to extract the parameters for di�erent PV electrical models. Simulation results show the CS has a faster convergence rate than the traditional Genetic Algorithm (GA), Pattern Search (PS) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in sequential processing. The PPSO, with an accurate estimation capability, can reduce at least 50 % of the elapsed time for an Intel i 7 quad-core processor. A major challenge in the utilization of PV generation is posed by its non linear Current-Voltage (I-V) relations, which result in the unique Maximum Power Point (MPP) varying with di�erent atmospheric conditions. Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) is a technique employed to gain maximum power available from PV devices. It tracks operating voltage corresponding to the MPP and constrains the operating point at the MPP. A novel model-based two-stage MPPT strategy is proposed in this thesis to combine the o�ine maximum power point estimation using the Weightless Swarm Algorithm (WSA) with an online Adaptive Perturb & Observe (APO) method. In addition, an Approximate Single Diode Model (ASDM) is developed for the fast evaluations of the output power. The feasibility of the proposed method is veri�ed in an MPPT system implemented with a Single-Ended Primary-Inductor Converter (SEPIC). Simulation results show the proposed MPPT method is capable of locating the operating point to the MPP under various environmental conditions...|$|R

40|$|In 2008, MIT’s Peter Senge et al. {{wrote that}} the Industrial Age bubble was ending and that, {{especially}} due to climate change, a “Necessary Revolution” was needed to create a sustainable flourishing world in the decades ahead. Since then, many business organizations have moved toward sustainability to some degree, and many other organizations have emerged, mostly non-profits, to help business and/or prod them to pursue ethical strategies. This report explains how the revolution is unfolding, by briefly mapping some 150 organizations that are driving the greening of capitalism, and grouping them in several meaningful categories: Business-Led Groups, Ethical Groups, Broadened Accounting Groups, Certifying Organizations, Green Investing Groups, Sustainability Consultants, and Green Business Publishing. Each of these groups is important in facilitating the revolution, especially those promoting corporate social responsibility, broader accounting practices, certification, and green investing. Among groups that list their beginning, the median start-up date was 2003 —thus a doubling in 13 years. This revolution certainly appears to be well underway, leading to a contest between 21 st Century Green (or Sustainable) Capitalism, valuing the triple bottom line of People/Planet/Profit to some degree vs. 20 th Century Industrial Era Capitalism that adheres to a single bottom line and narrow accounting measures. But the revolution is a quiet one that is underappreciated, due to fragmentation and lack of leadership. Hopefully, if well-publicized and widely discussed, the January 2017 Better Business, Better World report of the Business and Sustainable Development Commission, making a strong all-win business case for pursuing the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals, could provide a large boost to the necessary revolution. In turn, this could <b>energize</b> the larger <b>system</b> of more than 1500 sustainability-related organizations that are identified in the 329 -page April 2017 Interim Draft of The Security & Sustainability Guide. We are not yet winning the struggle for sustainability in our era of great and intensifying uncertainty and danger. But with cities and responsible business taking the lead, and with more horizontal thinking that includes broad consideration of security issues, the necessary revolution can become more visible and thus accelerate...|$|R
40|$|The {{fixation}} of {{inorganic carbon}} and the conversion to organic molecules {{is a prerequisite}} for life and the foundation of the carbon cycle on Earth. Since the industrial revolution, this carbon cycle has become inbalanced and consequently the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentration is increasing and is a major cause of global warming. On the contrary, atmospheric CO 2 can also be considered as an important carbon feedstock of the future. However, human society has not yet come up with a viable solution to convert this inorganic atmospheric CO 2 back into reduced carbon compounds and is still relying on natural CO 2 fixation. Nature has evolved multiple solutions to reduce CO 2 and incorporate it into organic molecules. The involved pathways differ in their cofactor requirements and are often limited to anoxic conditions. Many {{attempts have been made to}} improve natural carbon fixation to a more energy efficient process, but showed little success. The emerging field of synthetic biology offers an alternative approach by designing novel pathways for the fixation of CO 2. Although, several such artificial pathways have been designed, none of them have been realized so far. This reveals an existing gap between the design and the realization and implementation of such a synthetic CO 2 fixation pathway. In this work we designed several synthetic oxygen-tolerant CO 2 fixation pathways in a bottom-up approach, by freely combining enzymes from different biological sources. The pathways were designed around an efficient central carboxylase from the family of enoyl-CoA carboxylases/reductases. Some members of this family belong to the most efficient carboxylases known so far, do not accept oxygen as a substrate and only require the ubiquitous NADPH as co-substrate. The theoretical analysis of thermodynamic and energetic properties of the designed pathways for CO 2 fixation also showed that they are comparable or even more energy efficient than naturally occurring oxygen-tolerant CO 2 -fixing pathways. We were able to realize two of these cycles in vitro and investigated their efficiencies for the fixation of inorganic CO 2 into organic molecules. We established the Crotonyl-CoA/EThylmalonyl-CoA/Hydroxybutyryl-CoA (CETCH) and HydrOxyPropionyl-CoA/Acrylyl-CoA (HOPAC) cycle in vitro and their CO 2 fixation efficiencies were increased in several rounds of optimization. In this process, we <b>energized</b> the <b>systems</b> by ATP- and NADPH-regeneration modules, applied the principle of metabolic proofreading to recycle undesired side products and engineered several enzymes to efficiently catalyze desired reactions. The CETCH cycle in its current version 5. 4 is a reaction network of 17 enzymes originating from nine different organisms of all three domains of life. It converts CO 2 into organic molecules at a rate of 5 nmol CO 2 per minute and mg enzyme. In comparison, the HOPAC cycle in its current version 4. 1 comprises 15 enzymes originating from eight different organisms. A stepwise incorporation of 13 CO 2 into the intermediates of both synthetic pathway confirmed a continuous operation for multiple rounds of conversion. During the development of the synthetic cycles for CO 2 fixation, we solved a novel crystal structure of a key enzyme for both pathways, the methylsuccinyl-CoA dehydrogenase. This is a member of the well described family of flavin dependent acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. We elucidated the substrate specificity of the enzyme for (2 S) -methylsuccinyl-CoA, which represents a complex substrate amongst the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family. In summary, this study laid the foundation for the development of artificial pathways for the fixation of CO 2 and narrow the gap between theoretical design of synthetic CO 2 fixation pathways and their application in vivo. The CETCH and HOPAC cycle expands the solution space beyond the six naturally evolved CO 2 fixation pathways by two man-made alternative that are thermodynamically more efficient than the CBB cycle of plants...|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} side, the {{protection}} systems have changed {{significantly from the}} bygone decade and will change continuously {{as a result of}} the advancement of technology. Therefore, power systems designers are seeking to apply digital devices to handle the increasing complexity of power system, which improve the cost and usability. Subsequently, the digital technology has appeared in the protection system of microprocessor relays since 1980 and developing to those with communications interfaces in the a 990 s [20]. Today, digital relays have featured with high speed communication, which helped in replacing wires for safety interlocking, control and also circuit breakers tripping action. Furthermore, there are many applications of digital relays in transmission and generation system protection due to their flexibility, high performance level, and capability of operating under different temperatures compared to the classical electromechanical relays. Therefore, this study focuses on the digital protection device, (e.g. OUFR) to be coordinated with LFC for MG dynamic security. There are several studies have dealt this problem from the short circuit fault side only such as, the optimized time-based coordination of conventional over-current relays; which is the earliest protection technique for utility grids including micro-grids [21]. This method has a limit in its ability of multi-relay protection because of its high sensitivity to components parameters in high fault levels. Sheng et al. [22] presented a multi-agent method depend on assumptions of high fault current levels. However, this method has been developed to island the MG for any fault in the utility grid and also disconnecting most of distributed generations (DGs) for faults within the MG. Furthermore, some studies handled the frequency protection problems such as; Laghariet et al. [23] applied an intelligent computational technique for load shedding of the power system under faulted conditions. Moreover, Komsan and Naowarat [24] discussed the same issue by using the rate of change under frequency relay to improve the load shedding scheme in MGs. Further, Freitas et al. [25] presented a comparative study of the rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) and vector surge relays for distributed generation applications. However, they faced a very hard task in relays coordination as their design may not detect the islanded conditions within the required time. Teimourzadeh et al. [26] introduced a new Region of Attraction (ROA) based protection zone for the detection of MG security status. However, the proposed approach is an efficient index for providing a quick detection of MG security status. Jose Vieira et al. in [27] proposed the coordination of ROCOF and under/over frequency relays. However, this presented coordination has a drawback, which it did not compensate the frequency fluctuations within the allowable frequency limit due to the action of the relay is <b>energized</b> when the <b>system</b> frequency become out of the allowable limit. Such a problem can be overcome by designing the proposed coordination strategy of LFC and digital OUFR for an islanded MG system dynamic security.|$|R
