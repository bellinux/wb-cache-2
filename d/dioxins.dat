5|$|Many {{organochlorine}} compounds {{have been}} isolated from natural sources ranging from bacteria to humans.

40|$|The <b>dioxin</b> {{receptor}} mediates {{signal transduction}} by <b>dioxin</b> (2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) and binds to DNA target sequences as a heterodimer {{of the approximately}} 100 kDa ligand binding receptor and the approximately 85 kDa auxiliary factor, Arnt. Both of these factors encompass an N-terminal basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) motif required for DNA binding and dimerization. In this study we describe the construction of glucocorticoid/dioxin receptor fusion proteins which allow the regulation of glucocorticoid receptor activity by <b>dioxin</b> in transient transfections of CHO and hepatoma cells. Thus, {{in the absence of}} <b>dioxin,</b> chimeric receptor constructs which contain large 500 - 720 amino acid C-terminal <b>dioxin</b> receptor fragments, but lack the N-terminal bHLH motif, confer repression upon the transcriptional activity of a glucocorticoid receptor derivative, tau DBD, containing its N-terminal strong transactivating signal (tau) and its DNA binding domain (DBD). In the presence of <b>dioxin,</b> this repression is reversed. Importantly, these chimeric receptors did not require the bHLH Arnt co-factor for function. A considerably smaller region of the <b>dioxin</b> receptor, located between amino acids 230 and 421, showed specific <b>dioxin</b> binding activity in vitro. Moreover, <b>dioxin</b> binding in vitro correlated with the ability of receptor fragments to form stable complexes in vitro with the molecular chaperone hsp 90. These findings support the notion that hsp 90 may be important for folding of a <b>dioxin</b> binding configuration of the receptor. Finally, tau DBD activity was constitutively repressed in a <b>dioxin</b> non-responsive manner by <b>dioxin</b> receptor fragments which failed to bind ligand but also failed to bind hsp 90 in vitro, indicating that alternative mechanisms in addition to hsp 90 binding may contribute to the inactivation function. In summary, the <b>dioxin</b> receptor system provides a novel and complex model of regulation of bHLH factors that may also give important insights into the mechanism of action of ligand-activated nuclear receptors...|$|R
40|$|Aimed {{to give a}} {{preliminary}} image of <b>dioxin</b> pollution in China, chemometric analysis was performed to determine background <b>dioxin</b> levels during the period 1994 - 2002 and potential emission sources. Using principal components analysis (PCA), the congener profiles of 71 sediment samples from rivers, lakes, and sea bays around China were compared with the congener profiles of various known or suspected industrial, residential, and municipal <b>dioxin</b> sources {{to determine whether the}} <b>dioxin</b> residues typically found in a broad range of potential environmental sources could explain the presence of these chemicals in China. It was found that the background <b>dioxin</b> levels of China were similar to those of lightly polluted samples from other countries during the period 1994 - 2002. Primary ferrous ore sintering and secondary lead and aluminum smelters were the major sources of <b>dioxin</b> emission in China. Chloranil and wastewater from chemical plants, sodium pentachlorophenate, and pulp bleaching were also important sources of <b>dioxin</b> emission. Open burning of e-waste as well as diesel-fueled and leaded gas-fueled vehicles were additional possible sources of <b>dioxin.</b> In contrast to other countries, in China, flue gases from incineration of municipal waste, hazardous waste, and medical waste might be minor sources of <b>dioxin</b> emission.

5|$|About 17.8 percent——of {{the total}} forested area of Vietnam was sprayed during the war, which {{disrupted}} the ecological equilibrium. The persistent nature of <b>dioxins,</b> erosion caused by loss of tree cover, {{and loss of}} seedling forest stock meant that reforestation was difficult (or impossible) in many areas. Many defoliated forest areas were quickly invaded by aggressive pioneer species (such as bamboo and cogon grass), making forest regeneration difficult and unlikely. Animal-species diversity was also impacted; in one study a Harvard biologist found 24 species of birds and five species of mammals in a sprayed forest, while in two adjacent sections of unsprayed forest there were 145 and 170 species of birds and 30 and 55 species of mammals.|$|E
5|$|Some {{types of}} organochlorides, though not all, have {{significant}} toxicity to plants or animals, including humans. <b>Dioxins,</b> produced when organic matter is {{burned in the}} presence of chlorine, and some insecticides, such as DDT, are persistent organic pollutants which pose dangers when they are released into the environment. For example, DDT, which was widely used to control insects in the mid 20th century, also accumulates in food chains, and causes reproductive problems (e.g., eggshell thinning) in certain bird species. Due to the ready homolytic fission of the C–Cl bond to create chlorine radicals in the upper atmosphere, chlorofluorocarbons have been phased out due to the harm they do to the ozone layer.|$|E

40|$|In mammals {{the basic}} helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim (bHLH/PAS) family of {{transcription}} factors includes the <b>dioxin</b> receptor {{which is a}} ligand-dependent transcription factor which mediates biological effects of environmental pollutants such as 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-rho-dioxin (<b>dioxin).</b> In the absence of ligand, the <b>dioxin</b> receptor {{is associated with the}} molecular chaperone Hsp 90 and two Hsp 90 interacting proteins, the co-chaperone p 23 and an immunophilin-like protein XAP 2. The interaction of Hsp 90 with the receptor is required to maintain the nonactivated form of the <b>dioxin</b> receptor in a high-affinity ligand-binding and repressed conformation. In our studies we have demonstrated that the stability of the latent, p 23 associated <b>dioxin</b> receptor-Hsp 90 complex, is critical determinant for ligand-iducible activation of the receptor to a functional form. Furthermore, the molecular chaperone Hsp 90 complex regulate intracellular localization of the <b>dioxin</b> receptor. More specifically, ligand-inducible nuclear import of the <b>dioxin</b> receptor is regulated by the Hsp 90 -p 23 complex via modulation of the interaction of the NLS motif of the receptor with importin-alpha (pendulin). Moreover, the association of the Hsp 90 complex with the PAS domain of the <b>dioxin</b> receptor is required to maintain a pool of the nonactivated receptor in the cell cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic accumulation of the <b>dioxin</b> receptor complex is mediated by a novel Hsp 90 -interacting protein XAP 2. In addition, XAP 2 has a role in stabilizing protein levels of the <b>dioxin</b> receptor by inhibiting ubiquitination of the receptor. Recently we have demonstrated that the Cterminal part of XAP 2 is required to directly contact Hsp 90, whereas the N-terminal portion of XAP 2 serves as an interaction site for the <b>dioxin</b> receptor complex and plays a role in stabilizing the ternary <b>dioxin</b> receptor-Hsp 90 -XAP 2 complex. In addition, the integrity of the N-terminal region of XAP 2 is essential for XAP 2 to regulate intracellular localization of the <b>dioxin</b> receptor. These studies provide a basis for our understanding of regulation of protein function by the still enigmatic and intricate Hsp 90 molecular chaperone machinery. This is illustrated by the complex mechanism of conditional regulation of <b>dioxin</b> receptor function which is critically dependent on the interaction with the Hsp 90 chaperone complex...|$|R
25|$|The next largest {{sources of}} <b>dioxin</b> in the EPA {{inventory}} are medical and municipal waste incinerators. Various {{studies have been}} conducted that reach contradictory results. For instance a study of commercial-scale incinerators showed no relationship between the PVC content of the waste and <b>dioxin</b> emissions. Other studies have shown a clear correlation between <b>dioxin</b> formation and chloride content and indicate that PVC is a significant contributor to the formation of both <b>dioxin</b> and PCB in incinerators.|$|R
40|$|The {{intracellular}} basic region/helix-loop-helix (bHLH) <b>dioxin</b> receptor mediates {{signal transduction}} by <b>dioxin</b> (2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) and {{functions as a}} ligand-activated DNA binding protein directly interacting with target genes by binding to <b>dioxin</b> response elements. Here we show that the partially purified, ligand-bound receptor alone could not bind target DNA. In contrast, DNA binding by the receptor could be induced by addition of a cytosolic auxiliary activity which functionally and biochemically corresponded to the bHLH factor Arnt. While Arnt exhibited no detectable affinity for the <b>dioxin</b> response element {{in the absence of}} the <b>dioxin</b> receptor, it strongly promoted the DNA binding function of the ligand-activated but not the ligand-free receptor forms. Arnt also functionally reconstituted in vitro the DNA binding activity of a mutant, nuclear translocation-deficient <b>dioxin</b> receptor phenotype in cytosolic extracts from a dioxin-resistant hepatoma cell line. Importantly, coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that Arnt physically interacted in solution with the ligand-activated <b>dioxin</b> receptor but failed to heterodimerize with the ligand-free, hsp 9 O-associated receptor form. Mutational analysis suggested that the functional interaction between these two factors occurred via the bHLH motif of Arnt. These data suggest that <b>dioxin</b> receptor activity is governed by a complex pattern of combinatorial regulation involving repression by hsp 9 O and then by ligand-dependent recruitment of the positive coregulator Arnt. The <b>dioxin</b> receptor system also provides the first example of signal-controlle...|$|R
5|$|Gases {{from the}} furnace are cleaned using {{selective}} non-catalytic reduction (SNCR), spray absorbers and active carbon injection. These processes remove nitrogen oxides, acidic gasses, <b>dioxins</b> and heavy metals from the plants emissions.

Each incineration line has its own independent stack in the chimney, and the flue gases are continuously monitored before being released. This information is relayed to the control room. The remaining fly ash from the filters contains particles from the incineration, lime from the spray absorbers, salt and carbon dust, and so is stored in a sealed silo until it is taken from the site for disposal. Incinerator bottom ash left on the incineration grate after the burning is moved by converyor to a bunker. Whilst on the conveyor, a magnet removes ferrous metal from the ash for recycling. The remaining ash is then used as an aggregate in the construction industry.|$|E
5|$|By far most {{information}} on toxicity of dioxin-like chemicals {{is based on}} animal studies utilizing TCDD. Almost all organs are affected by high doses of TCDD. In short-term toxicity studies in animals the typical effects are anorexia and wasting, and even after a huge dose animals die only 1 to 6 weeks after the TCDD administration. Seemingly similar species have varying sensitivities to acute effects: lethal dose for a guinea pig is about 1µg/kg, but to a hamster {{it is more than}} 1,000µg/kg. A similar difference can be seen even between two different rat strains. Various hyperplastic (overgrowth) or atrophic (wasting away) responses are seen in different organs, thymus atrophy is very typical in several animal species. TCDD also affects the balance of several hormones. In some species, but not in all, severe liver toxicity is seen. Taking into account the low doses of <b>dioxins</b> in the present human population, only two types of toxic effects have been considered to cause a relevant risk to humans: developmental effects and cancer.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{the problem}} of ammonia levels in the final {{effluent}} was addressed by {{the construction of a}} system using anoxic zones and diffuse air activated sludge treatment. This dramatically reduced ammonia levels, and was the most significant factor in the re-establishment of fish stocks in the lower River Don. In 1990, the outdated filter presshouse and incineration plant were replaced by a new sludge-dewatering plant and a fluidized-bed incinerator. The new plant made the old sludge beds, situated to the east of the River Don and on the island formed by the Don and the Holmes Cut, redundant, and these have now become a nature reserve. Further improvements to the process were completed by 2005. These included an upgrade to the wet scrubbing system, in order to remove heavy metals and acid gases such as sulphur dioxide, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride from the flue gases produced by the incinerator, and the addition of a tertiary adsorption filter, which removes mercury and <b>dioxins.</b> The improvements were designed to ensure that the plant met the standards set out in the Waste Incineration Directive.|$|E

A total number of twenty female goats were divided into four groups, each group consisted of 5 animals. The first group kept as control till the end of experimental period after 3 weeks post-treated. The second group was vaccinated with the Brucella Rev 1 vaccine. The third group was given an oral dose of 4 ml of stock standard solution of <b>dioxin</b> for 3 successive days. The fourth group was vaccinated with the Brucella Rev 1 vaccine and then given after that the dose of <b>dioxin</b> for each animal for 3 successive days. Blood samples were collected for detection of micronucleus, chromosome aberrations and Brucella antibodies titer.

Here we demonstrate that {{the integrity of the}} hsp 90 complex characterized by the presence of the hsp 90 -associated cochaperone p 23 and additional cochaperone proteins is important for regulation of the intracellular localization of the <b>dioxin</b> receptor by two mechanisms. First, in the absence of ligand, the <b>dioxin</b> receptor-hsp 90 complex was associated with the immunophilin-like protein XAP 2 to mediate cytoplasmic retention of the <b>dioxin</b> receptor. Second, upon exposure to ligand, the p 23 -associated hsp 90 complex mediated interaction of the <b>dioxin</b> receptor with the nuclear import receptor protein pendulin and subsequent nuclear translocation of the receptor. Interestingly, these two modes of regulation target two distinct functional domains of the <b>dioxin</b> receptor.
