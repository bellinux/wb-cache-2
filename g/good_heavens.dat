2500|$|Cushing is {{well known}} for playing Baron Victor Frankenstein and Professor Van Helsing in a long series of horror films {{produced}} by Hammer Film Productions in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. He was often cast alongside Christopher Lee, who became his best friend. His first appearances in his two most famous roles were in Terence Fisher's films The Curse of Frankenstein (1957) and Dracula (1958). He later said that his career decisions entailed selecting roles where he knew that he would be accepted by the audience. [...] "Who wants to see me as Hamlet? Very few. But millions want to see me as Frankenstein, so that's the one I do." [...] The film critic Roger Ebert described Cushing's work in the Hammer films thusly: [...] " [...] the one in all those British horror films, standing between Vincent Price and Christopher Lee. His dialog usually runs along the lines of, 'But <b>good</b> <b>heavens,</b> man! The person you saw has been dead for more than two centuries!'" ...|$|E
