40|$|Vent blocking, the {{covering}} of the filter ventilation zone on a cigarette during smoking, is a potentially {{important aspect of}} smoking behavior. Various techniques {{have been used to}} assess the incidence of vent blocking, and widely different views have been expressed on its importance. Studies relevant to <b>filter</b> <b>vent</b> blocking have been reviewed with two overall objectives: to examine critically the evidence on the occurrence of vent blocking and to assess the effects of vent blocking on the smoke yield to the smoker. The reviewed studies fall into four main categories: (1) measurements of the incidence of <b>filter</b> <b>vent</b> blocking among smokers; (2) the observed effects of vent blocking on cigarette ventilation and machine smoke yields; (3) the effect of experimentally blocking vents on human smoke yields; and (4) simultaneous determination of vent blocking and smoke yield under human smoking conditions. Direct observation indicates that only 4 % of smokers have their fingers in direct contact with the cigarette during puffing. Estimates of vent blocking incidence by lips during smoking range from 15 - 24 % (saliva-staining technique) to up to 50 % ('tar’ staining pattern technique) of smokers. For those smokers who do block the ventilation zone, a mean of 27 % of the vents are blocked, and a maximum of about 50 %. When the cigarettes are machine-smoked, the smoke yield increases in a highly non-linear manner as the blocked portion of the filter ventilation zone increases. This effect is also more pronounced at higher original filter ventilation levels. In contrast, smoking behavior monitoring techniques have shown that when the experimenter deliberately blocks the vent zone, the human smoker adjusts by taking smaller and fewer puffs. The blocked filter affects the yields of smoke components to the smoker less than it does smoking-machine measured yields. It is concluded that the incidence of vent zone blocking by fingers is quite low and relatively insignificant. The most reliable estimate for lip blocking is that up to 25 % of smokers may cover the vent zone during at least one puff and for most smokers the coverage is partial. Ventilation zone blocking as it occurs in practice has only a relatively minor effect on human smoke yields compared to other smoker behavior factors. When a human smoker inadvertently partially or completely blocks the filter ventilation zone during smoking, he/she adjusts by taking smaller and fewer puffs. Because of these changes in puffing behavior during human smoking, predictions of the effects of <b>filter</b> <b>vent</b> blocking on smoke yields based solely on smoking machine yields are deceptive...|$|E

40|$|From the {{viewpoint}} of protecting a containment vessel of light water reactor and suppressing the diffusion of radioactive materials from a light water reactor, {{it is important to}} develop the device which allows a <b>filtered</b> <b>venting</b> of contaminated high pressure gas. In the <b>filtered</b> <b>venting</b> system that used in European reactors, so called Multi Venturi scrubbers System is used to realize <b>filtered</b> <b>venting</b> without any power supply. This system is able to define to be composed of Venturi scrubbers (VS) and a bubble column. In the VS, scrubbing of contaminated gas is promoted by both gas releases through the submerged VS and gas-liquid contact with splay flow formed by liquid suctioned through a hole provided by the pressure difference between inner and outer regions of a throat part of the VS. However, the scrubbing mechanism of the self-priming VS including effects of gas mass flow rate and shape of the VS are understood insufficiently in the previous studies. Therefore, we started numerical and experimental study to understand the detailed two-phase flow behavior in the VS. In this paper, to understand the VS operation characteristics for the <b>filtered</b> <b>venting,</b> we performed numerical simulations of two-phase flow behavior in the VS. In the first step of this study, we perform numerical simulations of supersonic flow by the TPFIT to validate the applicability of the TPFIT for high velocity flow like flow in the VS.

40|$|As {{revealed}} by Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, countermeasures against severe accidents in {{nuclear power plants}} are an urgent need. In particular, {{from the viewpoint of}} protecting containment and suppressing diffusion of the radioactive materials, it is most important to install <b>filtered</b> <b>venting</b> devices to release high pressure contaminated gas to the atmosphere with elimination radioactive materials in the gas. A Multi Venturi Scrubber System (MVSS) is one of the <b>filtered</b> <b>venting</b> devices, and used in European reactors [1, 2]. One of the main components of the MVSS is a Venturi Scrubber (VS). It is considered that a dispersed or dispersed annular flow is formed in the VS by a self-priming phenomena. In the self-priming phenomena, the liquid was suctioned from a surrounding region of the VS {{to the inside of the}} VS. And a part of the radioactive materials are eliminated through the gas-liquid interface of the dispersed or annular dispersed flow. Therefore, to consider the MVSS operation characteristics, it is important whether to occur the self-priming or not and the liquid flow rate of the self-priming of the VS. The objective of this paper is to understand the self-priming phenomena of the VS for the <b>filtered</b> <b>venting.</b> And theoretical analysis and experiment were conducted. By comparing these results, we discussed about the mechanism of the self-priming phenomena.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{awareness and}} knowledge of cigarette filter ventilation in a national probability sample of smokers of Ultra-light, Light, and regular cigarettes. DESIGN: Random-digit-dialling and computer-assisted telephone interviewing was used on a probability sample of daily cigarette smokers (ages 18 and above). SUBJECTS AND SETTING: 218 Smokers of Ultra-light cigarettes, 360 smokers of Light cigarettes, and 210 smokers of Regular cigarettes living in the continental United States. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Percentage of respondents indicating knowledge {{of the presence of}} <b>filter</b> <b>vents</b> and the consequences of behavioural blocking of vents. RESULTS: Many smokers had not heard about or seen the filter holes: 43 % (95 % CI = 36 to 50 %) of smokers of Ultra-lights, 39 % (95 % CI = 34 to 44 %) of smokers of Lights, and 47 % (95 % CI = 40 to 54 %) of smokers of Regulars. About two in three smokers either did not know of the existence of rings of small holes on the filters of some cigarettes, or did not know that blocking increases tar yields: 69 % (95 % CI = 63 to 75 %) of Ultra- lights, 66 % (95 % CI = 61 to 71 %) of Lights, and 69 % (95 % CI = 63 to 75 %) of Regulars. CONCLUSIONS: Smokers are generally unaware of the presence and function of filter vents-a major design feature subject to behavioural blocking by smokers and now present on most cigarettes in the United States. Smokers and policy-makers need to be informed about the presence of <b>filter</b> <b>vents</b> and how vent blocking increases tar and nicotine yields from ostensibly very low-yield cigarettes. ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 In {{the wake}} of nuclear {{accidents}} such as Three Mile Island Unit 2 and Fukushima, the nuclear power industry’s safety record is scrutinized. Today the main concerns lies with hydrogen production in a nuclear reactor core when the zirconium fuel cladding reacts with the water coolant during an accident, creating combustible hydrogen gas. This concern is being addressed with new technologies for new nuclear power plants {{and the development of}} hydrogen mitigation techniques for currently operating plants. This study looks at a few potential safety upgrades including hydrogen mitigation upgrades such as hydrogen ignitors and Passive Autocatalytic Recombiners (PARs). As well as some radionuclide release mitigation safety upgrades, <b>filtered</b> <b>vents</b> and hardened vents. Using event tree/fault tree analysis to obtain probabilities and consequences of accidents and a newly developed “Economic Safety Factor (ESF) ” has been proposed. The ESF is a metric that is aimed at helping utilities and regulators decide whether a particular safety upgrade is beneficial for the cost. While the ESF is not the only mechanism a utility or regulator will consider when evaluating plant changes, it can give a good indication of whether or not a safety upgrade, or another type of upgrade is a good idea. It was found that hydrogen ignitors and PAR should be implemented. The addition of <b>filtered</b> <b>vents</b> is dependent on their cost {{based on the results of}} an ESF cost-benefit analysis method.

40|$|Filter {{ventilation}} is {{the dominant}} design feature of the modern cigarette that determines yields of tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide on smoking machine tests. The commercial use of filter ventilation was precipitated by the 1964 United States Surgeon‐General's report, further advanced by the adoption of an official Federal Trade Commission test in 1967, and still further advanced by {{the inclusion of a}} gas phase (carbon monoxide) measure in 1979. The first vented‐filter brand on the market in the United States (Carlton) in 1964 and the second major vented‐filter brand (True) in 1966 illustrate this. Ultimately, filter ventilation became a virtually required way to make very low tar cigarettes (less than 10  mg or, even more so, less than 5  mg tar). The key to the lower tar cigarette was not, in effect, the advanced selective filtration design characteristics or sophisticated tobacco selection or processing as envisioned by experts (although these techniques were and are used); the key to the very much lower tar cigarette was simply punching holes in the filter. We propose that the banning of <b>filter</b> <b>vents,</b> coupled with low maximum standard tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide yields, would contribute to making cigarettes much less palatable and foster smoking cessation or the use of clearly less hazardous nicotine delivery systems.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—The {{purpose was}} to {{determine}} filter ventilation and the nicotine content of tobacco and their contribution to machine-smoked yields of cigarettes from the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.  METHODS—Ninety-two brands of cigarettes (32  American, 23  Canadian, and 37  British brands) were purchased at retail outlets in State College, Pennsylvania, United States, Toronto, Canada, and London, United Kingdom. A FIDUS FDT filter ventilation tester measured the percentage air-dilution from <b>filter</b> <b>vents.</b> High-pressure, liquid chromatography {{was used to measure}} the nicotine content of tobacco. Regression techniques were used to examine the contributions of tobacco nicotine content and filter ventilation to machine-smoked yields of tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide (CO).  RESULTS—Ninety-four per cent of the American brands, 91 % of the Canadian brands, and 79 % of British brands were ventilated. The total nicotine content of tobacco and percent nicotine (by weight of tobacco) averaged 10. 2  mg (standard error of the mean (SEM) 0. 25, range: 7. 2  to 13. 4) and 1. 5 % (SEM 0. 03, range 1. 2  to 2) in the United States, 13. 5  mg (SEM 0. 49, range: 8. 0  to 18. 3) and 1. 8 % (SEM 0. 06, range: 1. 0  to 2. 4) in Canada, 12. 5  mg (SEM 0. 33, range: 9  to 17. 5) and 1. 7 % (SEM 0. 04, range: 1. 3  to 2. 4) in the United Kingdom. Multiple regression analyses showed that ventilation was by far the largest factor influencing machine-smoked yields of tar, nicotine, and CO.  CONCLUSION—Filter ventilation appears to be the predominant method for reducing machine-smoked yields of tar, nicotine, and CO in three countries. However, some brands contain about twice as much nicotine (total content or percent nicotine) as do others, indicating that tobacco types or blends and tobacco casings can be used to manipulate nicotine content and nicotine delivery of cigarettes.    Keywords: filter ventilation; nicotine content; cigarette...|$|R

40|$|The TRENDS {{models are}} applied at each time step to each control volume. Significant {{amounts of water}} occur only in the wetwell and drywell sump (the {{refueling}} pool is not a factor, as discussed earlier). In Fig. 2, we show the radiolytic acid production feeding into each of these pools. Since the water is initially neutral and no chemical additives are present, the acid additions are the major factors affecting pH. In Fig. 3, we see the downward trend of pH resulting from these acid additions. The conversion of iodide (I{sup {minus}}) to molecular iodine (I{sub 2 }) is most noticeable in the wetwell, since this is the repository of most iodide and HCl. Gradually, during the transient small amounts of more volatile iodine are formed. While iodide remains the dominant form, noticeable amounts of I{sub 2 } and intermediate species are created. Once produced in water, some I{sub 2 } is free to evaporate into airspace. Fig. 4 indicates the increase in all airborne iodine throughout the transient. This is compared to the MELCOR result for CsI aerosol, which decreases dramatically due to containment sprays. The I{sub 2 } in the airspace can be vented to the enclosure building or the environment. In the present accident sequence, the only path to the environment was through the SGTS, which was assumed to operate as in MELCOR. However, both are dwarfed by the MELCOR gaseous release during the first 12 h because MELCOR does not model spray washout of gaseous iodine. Steadily increasing throughout the transient, the revolatilization release is eventually more than an order-or-magnitude higher than the MELCOR aerosol release. Also, 99 % of iodine flowing directly through the SGTS was retained in filters. The remaining 1 % was released to the environment.
