For good {{management}} of the composting process {{it is essential to}} dispose of criteria to follow the progressive changes with time of chemical parameters in order to set the optimun composting endpoint. On the other hand, monitoring of changes in compost composition during the stabilization process is of key importance in assuring the quality of the final product for its agricultutal use. Among the well specified standards for compost the organic matter stability assume a particularly important role. To this stability made a decisive contribution the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the lipidic fraction. In this work we have monitorized by GC-MS the chemical changes that undergoes the lipids isolated from city refuse wastes at discrete intervals {{in the course of the}} composting process. Three different lipidic fraction were studied: i) from free monomers, ii) from sterified monomers, and from high molecular weight lipidic macromolecules, the two later obtained after saponification of the extract and the non <b>extractable</b> <b>residue.</b> Some significative alterations were detected, such as the increase in the concentration of low molecular weight alkanoic acids among the free lipids. Likewise, clear differences were found among the lipidic components released after transesterification treatment of compost samples at different degree of maturation with F 3 B-methanol.

40|$|Six major use {{pesticides}} (Atrazine, Dicamba, Isoproturon, Lindane, Paraquat and Trifluralin) {{with differing}} physico-chemical properties were evaluated for {{the significance of}} `bound' or non <b>extractable</b> <b>residue</b> formation. Investigations were carried out in purpose-built microcosms where mineralization, volatilisation, `soil water' extractable and organic solvent extractable residues could be quantified. Extractable residues were defined as those accessible by sequential extraction where the solvent used became increasingly non-polar. Dichloromethane was the `harshest' solvent used {{at the end of}} the sequential extraction procedure. C- 14 - labelled volatilised and (CO 2) -C- 14 fractions were trapped on exit from the microcosm. The pesticides were categorised into 3 classes based on their behaviour. (i) Type A (Atrazine, Lindane and Trifluralin) in which ring degradation was limited as was the formation of non-extractable residues; the remainder of the C- 14 -activity was found in the extractable fraction. (ii) Type B (Dicamba and Isoproturon) in which approximately 25 % of the C- 14 -activity was mineralised and a large portion was found in the non-extractable fraction after 91 days. Finally, Type C (Paraquat) in which almost all of the C- 14 -activity was quickly incorporated into the non-extractable fraction. The implications of the data are discussed, with respect to the variability and significance of regulatory aspects of non-extractable residues. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{objectives}} of these laboratory experiments were: (1) to assess bromoxynil sorption, mineralization, bound residue formation and <b>extractable</b> <b>residue</b> persistence in a Dundee silt loam collected from 0 – 2 cm and 2 – 10 cm depths under continuous conventional tillage and no-tillage; (2) {{to assess the}} effects of autoclaving on bromoxynil mineralization and bound residue formation; (3) to determine the partitioning of non-extractable residues; and (4) to ascertain the effects of bromoxynil concentration on extractable and bound residues and metabolite formation. RESULTS: BromoxynilKd values ranged from 0. 7 to 1. 4 L kg− 1 and were positively correlated with soil organic carbon. Cumulative mineralization (38. 5 % ± 1. 5), bound residue formation (46. 5 % ± 0. 5) and persistence of extractable residues (T 1 / 2 < 1 day) in non-autoclaved soils were independent of tillage and depth. Autoclaving decreased mineralization and bound residue formation 257 -fold and 6. 0 -fold respectively. Bromoxynil persistence in soil was rate independent (T 1 / 2 < 1 day), {{and the majority of}} non-extractable residues (87 %) were associated with the humic acid fraction of soil organic matter. CONCLUSIONS: Irrespective of tillage or depth, bromoxynil half-life in native soil is less than 1 day owing to rapid incorporation of the herbicide into non-extractable residues. Bound residue formation is governed principally by biochemical metabolite formation and primarily associated with soil humic acids that are moderately bioavailable for mineralization. These data indicate that the risk of off-site transport of bromoxynil residues is low owing to rapid incorporation into non-extractable residues...|$|E

Here we studied the bioaccumulation, elimination, and biotransformation of NP (12. 3 mg kg(- 1) soil dry weight) in a typical Chinese geophagous earthworm, Metaphire guillelmi, in a rice paddy soil, using 4 -[1 -ethyl- 1, 3 -dimethylpentyl]phenol (4 -NP(111)), the main constitute of technical NP, radiolabeled with (14) C. Earthworms rapidly bioaccumulated (14) C- 4 -NP(111) following a two-compartment first-order kinetics model. At steady state (after 20 days exposure), the normalized biota-soil accumulation factor amounted to 120, and 77 % of the accumulated radioactivity were present as nonextractable bound residues. The total radioactivity was eliminated from the earthworm following an availability-adjusted decay model and controlled by the elimination rate of the bound residues (half-life = 22. 6 days). The <b>extractable</b> <b>residues</b> consisted mainly of one less-polar metabolite (37 %) and polar compounds (50 %), including glucuronide conjugates of 4 -NP(111) and the metabolite; and free 4 -NP(111) accounted for only 9 % of the total <b>extractable</b> <b>residues.</b> This study provides the first results of the toxicokinetics and biotransformation of 4 -NP in a terrestrial organism, and underlines the significant underestimation of the bioaccumulation and risk assessment based only on free NP in earthworms...|$|R

However, the environmental behavior and fate of aminocyclopyrachlor are not fully understood. The aim {{of the present study}} was thus to evaluate the mineralization, <b>extractable</b> <b>residue</b> and bound residue formation of aminocyclopyrachlor in three tropical soils with different physico-chemical properties. 14 C-labeled [pyrimidine- 2 - 14 C] aminocyclopyrachlor was used to assess the fate of this herbicide in soil placed in biometer culture flasks. Total mineralization (accumulated 14 CO 2) of aminocyclopyrachlor was found to be Oxisol—Typic Hapludox (loamy sand) > Plinthosol—Petric (sandy clay). Overall, constant rate of mineralization (k) values for all soils were very low (0. 00050 % to 0. 00079 % 14 CO 2 d− 1), with mineralization half-life times (MT 50) consequently very high (877 to 1376 days), suggesting potential long persistence in soil. The amount of extractable residues decreased from ~ 31 % to 50 % in all soils after 126 days of incubation, indicating an increase in bound residue formation from ~ 5. 0 - to 7. 5 -fold compared to evaluation immediately after herbicide application, suggesting that degradation herbicide is involved in the formation of bound residues. Extractable residues are important factors that control mineralization and bound residue formation from aminocyclopyrachlor in the soil. The present study is the first to assess the fate, distribution, and formation of bound residues of aminocyclopyrachlor in soils. Aminocyclopyrachlor residues were predominantly associated with the OM and clay contents of soil.

The uptake and metabolism of [(14) C]diuron and [(14) C]linuron were investigated in wheat and radish.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{sorption}} and desorption of 14 C-labelled phenanthrene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, on soils, {{both in the}} laboratory using batch experiments and during 6 months of natural conditions using lysimeters. The laboratory results show that phenanthrene is strongly adsorbed, yielding empirical constants of sorption isotherms Kf of 163 for the clay soil and of 77 for the sandy loam soil. This result is unexpected because phenanthrene has a relatively high water solubility of 1. 1 mg/L. Phenanthrene is also poorly desorbed, as shown by leaching of only 30 % of initially sorbed phenanthrene. The natural condition results show that 27 % of the initial phenanthrene occurs as nonavailable, bound residues after 6 months. The leaching of 14 C phenanthrene derivatives amounts to less than 2 % of the applied phenanthrene. The 14 C phenanthrene derivatives leached included 80 % of polar products.

30|$|Methodological {{uncertainties}} come {{primarily from}} the procedures for removing the <b>extractable</b> <b>residues</b> to obtain the matrix containing only NER. Taking the paper from Barriuso et al. [11], the amounts of NER of pesticides vary strongly depending on the extraction procedures, with the largest variations of a factor up to 10. To give few examples: the amounts of NER of imazosulfuron vary between 19 and 68 % of the applied radioactivity, that of propoxycarbazone between 6 and 65 %, of propiconazole between 4 and 48 %. Another methodological uncertainty is the extraction procedures for investigation of NER (silylation for type I and type II NER differentiation and acidic hydrolysis for bioNER quantification): {{it is likely that}} silylation extracts and residues besides xenobiotic residues also contain bioNER, especially for compounds that are readily biodegraded. Therefore, type I non-extractable residues need to be investigated to address this uncertainty, but a method for analytical differentiation needs to be developed. Chemical analysis of type II NER, which are strongly bound and not releasable under physiological, natural conditions, is, however, not possible, i.e., the uncertainty of the apportionment of xenobiotic and biogenic residues in these fraction cannot be settled.|$|R

Wastewater treatment plants aren't usually able to clear pollution by pharmaceuticals completely, so part of them gets into the surface water. The ability to eliminate low concentrations of metformin via phytoextraction by Zea mays was studied in this thesis. The media of plants were contaminated by two levels of metformin concentration and during the plant cultivation the samples of media were taken in 24 hours interval. The decrease of metformin concentration in the samples was studied by HPLC with UV detection at 233 nm. The decrease was about 15 - 20 % per one day.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Metsulfuron-methyl {{is widely}} used for {{controlling}} many annual grasses and broadleaf weeds in cereal crops. Nonetheless, increasing evidence has demonstrated that even extremely low levels of metsulfuron-methyl residues in soil can be toxic to subsequent crops or non-target organisms. The behavior of herbicides in soils is mostly related to their residual forms. The intent {{of the present study}} was to investigate the dynamics of <b>extractable</b> <b>residues</b> (ERs) and non-extractable residues (NERs) of 14 C-metsulfuron-methyl in twelve Chinese paddy soils and their relationships to soil properties. RESULTS: ERs decreased gradually after application, whereas NERs increased rapidly during the initial 28 days, and gradually decreased thereafter. ERs and NERs were respectively 10. 1 – 67. 9 % and 5. 6 – 28. 7 % of applied radioactivity in soils at 224 days after application. ERs correlated positively with soil pH and silt fractions, and negatively with microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and clay fractions, but the opposite was observed for NERs. CONCLUSION: Both ERs and NERs may be present in the soil at the time of planting following rice crops, and the risk of phytotoxic effects needs to be considered. Soil pH, MBC and clay/silt fractions were the main factors in affecting the amounts of both ERs and NERs of metsulfuron-methyl in the tested soils...|$|R

Water and methanol <b>extractable</b> <b>residues</b> of 14 C labeled isoproturon have been determined in two Moroccan soils by β-counting–liquid chromatography. The quantification of bound residues in soil and in different fractions of soil humic substances has been performed using pyrolysis/scintillation-detected gas-chromatography. Microbial mineralization of the herbicide and soil organic matter has been also monitored. Retention of isoproturon residues after 30 -days incubation ranged from 22 % to 32 % (non-extractable fraction). The radioactivity extracted in an aqueous environment was from 20 % to 33 % of the amount used for the treatment; meanwhile, methanol was able to extract another 48 %. Both soils showed quantities of bound residues into the humin fraction higher than humic and fulvic acids. The total amount of residues retained into the organic matter of the soils was about 65 % of non-extractable fraction, and this percentage did not change with incubation time; on the contrary, the sorption rate of the retention reaction is mostly influenced by the clay fraction and organic content of the soil.

Ten months after atrazine treatment and with a cumulative rainfall of 502 mm, the leachates from the calcareous clay soil contained 3. 3 % of applied s-triazine radioactivity, while those from the loamy clay and high clay soils contained only 0. 9 % and 1. 1 %, respectively. The mobility of the s-triazine residues {{was not related to}} the distribution of organic carbon content withh depth. The proportion of <b>extractable</b> <b>residues</b> in the upper levels of the lysimeters was lower for the calcareous clay soil, 19. 2 % compared to 30. 0 and 28. 6 % in the loamy clay and high clay soils.

Erythromycin was reduced in surface water of sediment-containing systems by day 7, which corresponded to an increase of eryrthromycin detected in sediment.

To study the formation of tissue-bound residues in poultry, broilers were treated orally with nifursol during a period of 7 consecutive days, via medicated feed at a dosage of 50 mg/kg feed. Muscle, kidney, liver, bile and plasma samples were collected at the day of cessation of medication (day 0) and at days 3, 7, 14 and 21 after the end of medication. Samples were analysed for nifursol and the acid-hydrolysable side-chain of nifursol (DNSH; 3, 5 -dinitro salicylhydrazide). Samples were also analysed for the ratio between free (solvent-extractable) metabolites and tissue-bound (non-extractable) metabolites. The results obtained clearly indicate the formation of tissue-bound residues in poultry. Concentrations of non-extractable residue at zero withdrawal time averaged to 900 µg/kg in liver tissue, 2000 µg/kg in kidney tissue, 225 µg/kg in muscle tissue, 1000 µg/kg in bile and 1000 µg/kg in plasma.

HPLC analyses showed that the main metabolite of glyphosate, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) was detected after three days of incubation in the extracts of all three soils. Our results suggested that the possibility of contamination of groundwater by glyphosate was high on a long-term period in soils with high adsorption capacity and low degrading activities and/or acid similar to sandy loam soil.

While in the fulvic and humic acid fractions, the amount of BR increased with the ageing of the BR and occurred predominantly (60 %) in the fulvic acid fraction. The possibility of the mineralization and release of BR with ageing was studied using fresh soil and an incubation period of 90 days.

40|$|A {{sequential}} extraction {{scheme was}} developed for the quantitation of extractable and bound pesticide residues in field and wetland soils. Extractable and bound fractions of pesticides in soil were measured in spiked field and wetland soils that were stored for periods of up to ninety days. Treatment conditions included microbiological control {{through the use of}} irradiated soil and biocide. Bound pesticide residue formation was also studied as affected by moisture level, dark and light storage, and concentration. The water column of wetland microcosms was dosed with pesticides to study sorption behavior of pesticides in intact wetland systems. Extractable pesticide degradation in soils could be described by first-order rate kinetics. Dissipation curves of <b>extractable</b> <b>residues</b> in soil and from the water column of wetland microcosms exhibited biphasic kinetic behavior. Bound pesticide formation was greater in soils exposed to light than samples stored in the dark. Bound pesticides in spiked wetland soils after ninety days of storage accounted for nearly all the pesticide present in the soil and represented a major fraction of the amount of initially added pesticide. The formation of bound pesticide residues occurs during {{the first few days of}} contact with the soil with a substantial amount of instantaneous formation of bound residues. The instantaneous formation of bound residues in soil favors a model of energetically favorable entrapment of pesticides within voids and micropores arising within aromatic rich portions of the structure of aggregated humic acids. A triangular model of pesticides in soil was developed between those pesticides in the aqueous soil solution phase, pesticides partitioned to the soil phase, and those pesticides in the bound fraction. Equations were developed that describe the concentration of bound pesticides in field and wetland soils upon initial soil contact and also the maximum concentrations of bound pesticides in the soil as a function of contact time...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} in the US EPA Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Research House to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of chlorpyrifos following a professional crack and crevice application in the kitchen. Following the application, measurements were made in the kitchen, den and master bedroom over 21 days. Airborne concentrations were collected using both polyurethane foam (PUF) and the OSHA versatile sampler composed of XAD and PUF media located in tandem. Measured airborne concentrations were similar for the two samplers and were higher in the three rooms following the application. The highest measured concentrations were reached during the initial 24 -h following application; concentrations subsequently declined over the 21 -day study period to levels slightly above background. Spatial and temporal distributions onto surfaces were measured using 10 -cm 2 rayon deposition coupons located on the floor. Sections were cut from existing carpet to determine the total <b>extractable</b> <b>residues.</b> Chlorpyrifos was measured from all matrixes in the kitchen, den and bedroom and the data shows the transport of airborne residues from the point of application to remote locations in the house. The findings are compared and discussed relative to another study conducted in which total release aerosols containing chlorpyrifos were activated in the IAQ research house and the resulting distributions evaluated. For both studies dose estimates were constructed for the exposure pathways using the Stochastic Human Exposure and Dose Estimation Model for pesticides. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has been mandated to examine children’s exposure to environmental pollutants such as pesticides. This research specifically reduces uncertainties associated with estimating children’s potential exposures to residentially applied pesticides and provides inputs to further evaluate and validate residential exposure models which might be used to reduce exposures and perform risk assessments...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{long-term}} pesticide usage on soil microbial activities and degradation of 14 C-monocrotophos was observed under cotton field conditions. The experimental field {{was divided into}} treated and untreated plots. Pesticides were applied to treated plots at weekly intervals as in common practice in Thailand. The total numbers of applications were 11, 16 and 16 for first, second and third crop seasons, during the three years from 1996 to 1998. Soil samples at depths of 0 - 15 cm and 15 - 30 cm were sampled before and after pesticide application {{for the first two}} crops, while in the third crop season only the surface layer of soil was taken. The samples were assessed for CO 2 from respiration, soil microbial population, iron reduction capacity, and rates of nitrification. Soil biomass and microbial activities as measured from respiration and iron reduction decreased in the treated plots at both depths after each pesticide application over the three crop seasons, whereas samples from untreated plots at both depths did not show decreases. Repeated application of pesticides did not show any effect on nitrification rates of the first crop but there was inhibition {{in the second and third}} crops. Soil columns, treated with 14 C- monocrotophos one week after last pesticide application, were harvested after 0, 3, 6, 9, 18, 24 and 30 months. <b>Extractable</b> <b>residues</b> of 14 C were found only in the 0 - 15 cm layer. In treated and untreated plots, residues declined from 80. 17 and 85. 68 to 0. 44 % of the applied 14 C within 6 months. The long-term usage of pesticides did not affect the half-life of 14 C- monocrotophos. Bound residues of 14 C were found at the highest concentrations, 18. 94 and 12. 58 % of that applied, at 6 months in treated and untreated plots, thereafter the binding decreased to 4. 68 and 2. 74 % within 30 months...|$|R

Most work has been carried out on non—extractable residues in soils since in a number of cases such material may constitute {{a large proportion of the}} residual pesticide (as detected using radiochemical techniques).

40|$|The {{mineralization}} of 2, 4 -D, carbofuran and pirimiphos-methyl in Egyptian soils was studied over {{a period}} of 90 days. Laboratory studies under aerobic and anaerobic conditions were conducted using 14 C-ring labelled pesticides. Under anaerobic conditions 10 - 14 % of applied ring labelled 2, 4 -D mineralized during 90 days with no significant variations due to soil type. Under aerobic conditions, 2, 4 -D mineralized more readily in clay soil to reach 29 - 34 % of applied dose within 90 days. In clay loam soil, 14 C-carbofuran and 14 C-pirimiphos-methyl mineralized at a rather slow rate to reach 12 - 14 % and 12 - 13 % of applied dose in 90 days, respectively under aerobic conditions. Generally, soils repeatedly treated with pesticides gave a slightly lower percentage of mineralization than control soils. In all studies, the soil <b>extractable</b> pesticide <b>residues</b> decreased with time and the bound residues gradually increased. The highest binding affinity of about 26 - 29 % was observed with 2, 4 -D in clay soil under aerobic conditions in 90 days. Carbofuran, and pirimiphos-methyl, on the other hand, had lower binding capacity that did not exceed 16 % of applied radioactivity...|$|R
40|$|Veterinary {{and human}} {{antibiotics}} {{are found in}} manures and biosolids used in agriculture as organic amendments. The repeated introduction in cultivated soils of small amounts of antibiotics and by-products with organic waste may {{have an impact on}} microbial functions and communities, in particular by contributing to the acquisition of resistance against antibiotics. The effects of antibiotics on microorganisms are in theory linked to the bioavailable fraction of compounds in soil, which could be influenced by the treatment of organic waste (e. g. composting). The objective {{of this study was to}} follow the evolution of the (bio) available fraction of two antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole, SMX; ciprofloxacin, CIP) in soil after the application of two types of organic waste (compost of sewage sludge with green waste, bovine manure) currently used on the long-term field experiment QualiAgro (INRA–Veolia partnership 1998 – 2013). Soft chemical extractants were selected for this purpose and compared. Mixtures of soil (5 g dry mass, DM) and organic waste (0. 15 g DM of either compost or manure) initially enriched with of a 14 C-labelled antibiotic (14 C-SMX: 0. 74 mg. kg- 1 DM; 14 C-CIP: 4. 97 mg. kg- 1 DM) were incubated under controlled aerated conditions for 28 days. The mineralization of the 14 C-antibiotic and the organic matter was followed over the incubation period. At 0, 7 and 28 days, the (bio) availability of each 14 C-antibiotic in mixtures was assessed through a soft chemical extraction with different aqueous solutions. A second extraction with an acetonitrile/water mixture was performed and solid residues were then dried and burnt in order to quantify the fraction of non-extractable 14 C-SMX and 14 C-CIP residues. The fractions of extracted 14 C-antibiotic residues differed according to the type of aqueous solution in both types of organic waste-soil mixtures. The availability of 14 C-SMX decreased rapidly over time. The availability of 14 C-CIP was very low at the start of the incubation but it slightly increased at 7 days for the manure treatment. Regardless of the choice of the aqueous solution, significant amounts of non- <b>extractable</b> <b>residues</b> (NER) were formed after 28 days. The choice of the aqueous solution impacted more the relative proportions of 14 C-antibiotic residues extracted by the aqueous solutions and the acetonitrile/water mixture than the amounts of NER. Less than 1 % of the initially added 14 C-CIP was mineralized after 28 days, against 2 - 3 % for 14 C-SMX. The mineralization of organic matter was more important with manure. We hypothesize that the stimulation of microbial activity may explain the greater formation of NER of 14 C-SMX residues for the manure treatment...|$|R
40|$|A 1, 280 -day {{laboratory}} simulation of the “landfarming” process explored the fate in soil of polynuclear aromatics (PNAs) and total <b>extractable</b> hydrocarbon <b>residues</b> originating from {{the disposal of}} an oily sludge. In addition to the measurement of CO 2 evolution, periodic analyses of PNAs and hydrocarbons monitored biodegradation activity. The estimation of carbon balance and of soil organic matter assessed the fate of residual hydrocarbons. Seven sludge applications during a 920 -day active disposal period were followed by a 360 -day inactive “closure” period with no further sludge applications. A burst of CO 2 evolution followed each sludge addition, but substantial amounts of undegraded hydrocarbons remained {{at the end of}} the study. Hydrocarbon accumulation did not inhibit biodegradation performance. Conversion of hydrocarbons to CO 2 predominated during active disposal; incorporation into soil organic matter predominated during the closure period. In this sludge, the predominant PNAs were degraded more completely (85 %) than total hydrocarbons. Both biodegradation and abiotic losses of three- and four-ring PNAs contributed to this result. Some PNAs with five and six rings were more persistent, but these constituted only a small portion of the PNAs in the sludge. The study confirmed that the microbially mediated processes of mineralization and humification remove sludge hydrocarbons from soils of landfarms with reasonable efficiency...|$|R
30|$|The {{approach}} of the described extraction steps “Use of aqueous solutions to {{determine the amount of}} residues being easily desorbable”, “Use of organic solvent mixtures to extract thoroughly the matrix” and “Exhaustive extraction” follows in principle that of Ortega-Calvo et al. [70] who suggests to use the extraction sequence aqueous solutions, passive sampling extractions (e.g., TENAX), organic solvents at room temperature and at elevated temperature (e.g., ASE), to obtain the matrix containing only NER. Each of the fractions obtained by the above extraction steps can be used to analyze the amounts and to identify the structures of the <b>extractable</b> fractions. The <b>residues</b> remaining after the extractions in the matrix are defined as non-extractable residues (NER), which may include also bioNER (type III). These NER, thus, should be analyzed for the different types of NER.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{environmental}} effects of the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin from livestock production practices and its possible influence in aquatic ecosystems. The veterinary antibiotic, erythromycin, is used for disease prevention and growth promotion in livestock. Erythromycin has been frequently detected in streams and sediments in the U. S. The widespread use of veterinary antibiotics in agriculture has led to increased concern about their environmental fate. For this research, a microcosm system was utilized to monitor the fate (including movement, binding, and degradation) along with bioavailability of the compound to aquatic invertebrates. The bioavailability study included {{the development of a}} surrogate model using a passive sampling device to assess erythromycin in aquatic systems with and without sediment. Analytical procedures to detect erythromycin in water and sediment were improved to assist in quantification. Results from the environmental fate study indicate that erythromycin has an affinity to bind to particulate matter and sediment and is influenced by biotic processes especially mineralization. An aged sediment microcosm system was incubated with erythromycin for 0, 1, 3, and 8 weeks which demonstrated its ability to be sequestered, but addition of surface water columns to the aged residues influenced the mobility of erythromycin into water and from <b>extractable</b> sediment <b>residues.</b> Erythromycin {{has been shown to be}} less bioavailable to aquatic organisms, compared to sulfamethazine, but additional studies with sediment containing a manure amendment could possibly influence its ability to affect non-target organisms through exposure and uptake...|$|R
30|$|I {{have been}} working on NER of {{xenobiotics}} mainly in the soil world, and I was surprised to realize that compared to soil very little has been published on sediments although it is quite plausible to assume a similar mechanistic picture of NER formation. For instance Luo et al. stated that it is not sufficient to analyze just the extractable portions of brominated flame retardants in sediments but rather to characterize also the sequestered portions (type I NER, that might be remobilized) to get the full picture of contamination [5]. El-Mufleh et al. (2013) showed that PAH are mainly sequestered in the unsoluble part of sediment organic matter (humin) [6]. Sediment bound pesticides were identified as the primary source for ecotoxicity, although in most papers this refers only to the <b>extractable</b> part of <b>residues</b> [6]. Anyway, it is obvious that sediment NER is a neglected research field which needs more attention. I will try to work on that in the remaining years until I will be retired.|$|R
