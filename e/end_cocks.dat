50|$|On 5 July 1864 Cock and {{his family}} arrived in Nelson. The {{directors}} were disappointed when on examining the mines Cock came {{to the same conclusion}} that had already been conveyed to them regarding the chromite supplies. He set about prospecting other areas in the mineral belt in an attempt to find other workable lodes of chromite, including a deposit below the railway which would have required a branch line to be constructed. In the <b>end,</b> <b>Cock</b> reported that constructing such a line would not be financially viable.|$|R
60|$|To {{this the}} Beggar listened with his {{knuckles}} resting against his hips, and when Robin had <b>ended</b> he <b>cocked</b> {{his head on}} one side and thrust his tongue into his cheek.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cock</b> <b>ended</b> {{his first}} class playing career with 234 Football League goals from 391 matches. He wound down playing for non-league sides such as Folkestone and Walton & Hersham. He managed Millwall between 1944 and 1948, {{leading them to}} the War Cup South final at Wembley in 1945, where they lost to his old side Chelsea. The club's playing squad was hit hard by World War II and they were relegated {{at the end of}} the 1947-48 season; he left the job shortly afterwards.|$|R
50|$|In 1773 the Leeds and Liverpool Canal {{was opened}} {{and then in}} 1786 the Keighley to Kendal turnpike road was opened. This was {{followed}} in 1823 by the Blackburn, Addingham, <b>Cocking</b> <b>End</b> Road. The improvements brought {{large numbers of people}} to the area and many more houses and workplaces were built. Six stagecoaches a day took advantage of these new roads. In 1847, Kildwick and Cross Hills railway station was opened, which had perhaps the greatest effect on the village and marked the end of the stagecoach era.|$|R
5000|$|John Gilbert Cock DCM MM (14 November 1893 - 19 April 1966) Born in Hayle, had the {{distinction}} of being the first Cornishman to play football, and score, for the England national team. Cock played for Huddersfield Town, Chelsea, Everton, Plymouth Argyle & Millwall. Cock was a decorated World War I soldier, and an actor. <b>Cock</b> <b>ended</b> his first class playing career with 234 Football League goals from 391 matches. He managed Millwall between 1944 and 1948, leading them to the War Cup South final at Wembley in 1945, where they lost to Chelsea. He made his England debut against Ireland in 1919, and scored after 30 seconds.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I've got a messmate,' he continued; 'William Cooley is his name. We {{call him}} Truthful Billy. He's {{as good a}} seaman as ever trod quarter-deck; but when he gets {{spinning}} yarns he ain't {{the sort of man}} as I could advise you to rely upon. Well, Billy, he's got a dog, and I've seen him sit and tell yarns before that dog that would make a cat squirm out of its skin, and that dog's taken 'em in and believed 'em. One night, up at his old woman's, Bill told us a yarn by the side of which salt junk two voyages old would pass for spring chicken. I watched the dog, to see how he would take it. He listened to it from beginning to <b>end</b> with <b>cocked</b> ears, and never so much as blinked. Every now and then he would look round with an expression of astonishment or delight that seemed to say: [...] "Wonderful, isn't it!" [...] "Dear me, just think of it!" [...] "Did you ever!" [...] "Well, if that don't beat everything!" [...] He was a chuckle-headed dog; you could have told him anything.|$|R
50|$|The cocking piece {{doubles as}} a safety and is {{attached}} {{at the rear of}} the bolt sleeve assembly and secures the firing pin. When the <b>cocking</b> piece <b>ending</b> in a <b>cocking</b> ring is pulled rearward and turned horizontal, the cocking piece sear can be placed in a recessed safety slot in the bolt plug. This slot is shorter than the firing slot so the firing pin cannot protrude past the face of the bolt cylinder. Any contact with the cartridge primer is thus prevented. The safe mode also prevents the action from being cycled hence preventing the bolt from accidental opening. The operating ring is quite large, making it easy to operate with gloves. When the operating ring is in the vertical position and pulled back by cycling the action or cocking it by hand the action is ready to fire.|$|R
50|$|The non-reciprocating {{cocking handle}} is located above the {{handguard}} and protrudes from the cocking handle tube at approximately a 45° angle. This rigid control {{is attached to}} a tubular piece within the cocking lever housing called the cocking lever support, which in turn, makes contact with the forward extension of the bolt group. It is not however connected to the bolt carrier and therefore cannot be used as a forward assist to fully seat the bolt group. The cocking handle is held in a forward position by a spring detent located in the front <b>end</b> of the <b>cocking</b> lever support which engages in the cocking lever housing. The lever is locked back by pulling it fully to the rear and rotating it slightly clockwise where it can be hooked into an indent in the cocking lever tube.|$|R
5000|$|Standard {{accessories}} {{supplied with}} the rifle include: a detachable bipod (not included with rifles {{that have a}} perforated plastic handguard), sling, cleaning kit and a speed-loading device. Several types of bayonet are available for the G3, but with few exceptions they require an adapter to be inserted into the <b>end</b> of the <b>cocking</b> tube. The most common type features a 6 inch spear-point blade nearly identical with the M7 bayonet, but with a different grip because of its mounting above the barrel. The weapon can also mount a 40 mm HK79 under-barrel grenade launcher, blank firing adapter a straight blowback bolt (called a [...] "PT" [...] bolt, lacks rollers) used for firing 7.62×51mm ammunition with plastic bullets, a conversion kit used for training with [...]22 Long Rifle ammunition and a sound suppressor (that uses standard ammunition).|$|R
5000|$|... "First Love, Last Rites" [...] {{the title}} story tells {{the tale of}} a narrator and his teenage lover, Sissel, who enjoy a long summer of love making. As well as {{acknowledging}} the immense gratification he gains from satisfying his most base instincts [...] "sperms... inches from my <b>cock's</b> <b>end...</b> the unstoppable chemistry of a creature growing out of dark red slime" [...] the narrator details the temptation he and his lover have of wallowing in animalistic decadence. This is personified by a giant pregnant rat whose presence is felt more and more, until it bursts out from its den and attacks. The narrator bludgeons it to death and realises the significance of it when he sees [...] "a translucent purple bag, and inside five pale crouching shapes" [...] i.e., the baby rats. Again a female has been killed and the reader must determine the relevance themselves.|$|R
5000|$|The artists {{included}} in the book were (in {{the order in which}} they appear in the book): Hubert van Eyck, Jan van Eyck, Hieronymus Bosch, Rogier van der Weyden, Dirk Bouts, Bernard van Orley, Jan Mabuse, Joachim Patinir, Quentin Matsys, Lucas van Leyden, Jan van Amstel, Joos van Cleve, Matthys Cock, Herri met de Bles, Jan Cornelisz Vermeyen, Pieter Coecke van Aelst, Jan van Scorel, Lambert Lombard, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Willem Key, Lucas Gassel, Frans Floris and <b>ending</b> with Hieronymus <b>Cock.</b> The book includes a poem by Lampsonius dedicated to the memory of Hieronymus Cock and applauding the work of his widow. [...] The portraits and texts present an honour roll of the earlier generations of Netherlandish artists. Their publication thus contributed to the formation of a canon of famous Netherlandish painters, which was well underway even before Karel van Mander published in 1604 his biographies of early and contemporary Netherlandish artists in his Schilder-boeck.|$|R
40|$|Background: Spontaneous {{fracture}} of the humeral shaft in throwers {{is a rare}} but well-known phenomenon. Although it has been hypothesized that the biomechanics of the throw cause such fractures, {{it is not clear}} how or when the fractures occur in the pitching motion. Methods: The torque acting about the long axis of the humerus was calculated in 25 professional baseball pitchers throwing in game situations. Results: Peak humeral axial torque reached a mean value of 92 ± 16 Nm near the time of maximum shoulder external rotation at the <b>end</b> of the <b>cocking</b> phase. This torque tended to externally rotate the distal end of the humerus relative to its proximal end. The direction of the torque was consistent with the external rotation spiral fractures of the humerus noted to occur in throwers. The magnitude of the peak humeral torque averaged 48 % of the theoretical torsional strength of the humerus, suggesting that repetitive stress plays a role in humeral shaft fractures. Conclusions: Fractures are most likely to occur near the time of maximum shoulder external rotation when humeral torque peaks. Pitchers whose elbows were more extended at stride foot contact tended to have lower peak humeral torques...|$|R
5000|$|The women wore {{their hair}} {{very long and}} tied {{together}} at the back, or [...] "tied {{at the back of}} the head and folded into a tress of about a hand's length, like a beaver tail… they wear around the forehead a strap of wampum shaped like the headband that some was worn in olden times." [...] "The men have a long lock hanging down, some on one side of the head, and some on both sides. On the top of their heads they have a streak of hair from the forehead to the neck, about the breadth of three fingers, and this they shorten until it is about two or three fingers long, and it stands right on <b>end</b> like a <b>cock's</b> comb or hog's bristles; on both sides of this cock's comb they cut all the hair short, except for the aforesaid locks, and they also leave on the bare places here and there small locks, such as aree in sweeping brushes and then they are in fine array." [...] This is the forerunner to what is today called a [...] "Mohawk hairstyle." ...|$|R
50|$|A small mill {{had been}} {{established}} by the Ecroyd family at Edge End as early as 1740, {{and there were two}} coal mines nearby, but it was the coming of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in 1796, followed by the East Lancashire Railway Line in 1849, that spurred its development as an industrial town, with an economy based mainly upon cotton weaving. The first Ordnance Survey map of the area, published in 1848 shows three small villages; Marsden (around St Paul's church), and Hebson and Bradley, both on Walverden Water in the modern-day centre of town. Also apparent are the estates of Marsden Hall to the east and Carr Hall across Pendle Water to the northwest. And the turnpike roads of the Marsden, Gisburn and Long Preston trust (Scotland Road) heading north and the Blackburn, Addingham and <b>Cocking</b> <b>End</b> trust (Manchester Road) heading east.Brierfield railway station was originally called Marsden and Nelson railway station became known as the Nelson Inn, Great Marsden, after the adjacent public house, the Lord Nelson Inn (named after Admiral Lord Nelson). As the villages developed into a town, the name Nelson was chosen to differentiate it from Marsden across the Pennines in the neighbouring county of Yorkshire (West Riding).|$|R
5000|$|The {{next stage}} in the Bank's {{development}} was to seek a London presence and, in particular, to gain {{a seat in the}} London Clearing House. Unsuccessful overtures were made to both Glyn's (the Bank's London agent), and to Cocks, Biddulph. However, the Bank's Chairman [...] "was successful in persuading the chairman ... of Martins Bank to agree to amalgamation and to accept the primacy of the Bank of Liverpool". Martins in turn recognised its need to expand into the provinces and the acquisition of Martins duly too place in 1918. Although Martins was much smaller than the Bank of Liverpool, the goodwill of its name and its seat on the Clearing House, meant that it {{was the only one of}} Liverpool's acquisition to preserve its name; the enlarged entity was called the Bank of Liverpool and Martins and when the name was eventually shortened in 1928, it was to just Martins Bank. The increased standing possessed by the Bank of Liverpool following its entry into the clearing house system then persuaded the private West <b>End</b> firm of <b>Cocks,</b> Biddulph to agree to its acquisition. By 1919, the Bank of Liverpool had become a national bank but one still based in the provinces.|$|R
