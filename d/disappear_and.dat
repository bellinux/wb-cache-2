Geno returns to the Star Road, Bowser rebuilds his castle with his newly reformed army, Mallow regains his rightful title as prince of Nimbus Land, and Mario and the princess return to the Mushroom Kingdom to celebrate their victory.|$|E
5|$|As Scully and the home's head doctor {{manage to}} stop the patient's seizures, the spirits <b>disappear</b> <b>and</b> the {{bathroom}} door gives way, freeing Mulder and Charters. The government of Massachusetts takes over the facility, and the orderly supplying the medicine is turned over to immigration services. The remaining original patients, no longer having access to the drug, revert to their previous state of dementia.|$|E
5|$|By {{the third}} chorus, the {{interior}} expands and more kachinas are summoned; this sequence also has flowing cherry blossom leaves. The bridge re-plays {{sections of the}} animated lady but with Utada singing the song, both overlapping each other. From there, {{the interior of the}} cathedral starts to <b>disappear</b> <b>and</b> move but then focuses on a herd of houses running through a vast corn field. The video ends with Utada stretching her arms against the sunlight, as the camera zooms away from her via bird's eye view, all shot by a toy airplane which was controlled by the director of the video.|$|E
40|$|<b>Disappeared</b> <b>and</b> reappeared: Nomada roberjeotiana (Hymenoptera: Apidae s. l.) In 2006 the waspbee Nomada roberjeotiana {{was found}} near Gees in the {{province}} of Drenthe. These were the first records since 1963. Possibly this species has really <b>disappeared</b> <b>and</b> recolonized the Netherlands. Its probable host Andrena denticulata has expanded in recent years...|$|R

5|$|In {{the second}} step, the crystal {{is placed in}} an intense beam of X-rays, usually of a single {{wavelength}} (monochromatic X-rays), producing the regular pattern of reflections. As the crystal is gradually rotated, previous reflections <b>disappear</b> <b>and</b> new ones appear; the intensity of every spot is recorded at every orientation of the crystal. Multiple data sets {{may have to be}} collected, with each set covering slightly more than half a full rotation of the crystal and typically containing tens of thousands of reflections.|$|E
5|$|In this episode, Veronica and {{her father}} Keith (Enrico Colantoni) {{investigate}} more suspects {{in the murder of}} Dean O'Dell (Ed Begley, Jr.), particularly his wife Mindy (Jaime Ray Newman) and her lover Hank Landry (Patrick Fabian). Both of them become particularly suspicious when they <b>disappear,</b> <b>and</b> Hank is implied as the killer when Mindy's dead body washes onshore. However, Veronica later deduces that teaching assistant Tim Foyle (James Jordan) committed the murder to frame Hank.|$|E
5|$|The game begins {{during the}} climax of Final Fantasy VII. As Vincent and Yuffie Kisaragi help to {{evacuate}} Midgar, which {{is about to be}} destroyed by Sephiroth's Meteor spell, Vincent finds the body of Professor Hojo slumped at the controls of the Sister Ray cannon. After a flash of lightning, Hojo's body seems to <b>disappear,</b> <b>and</b> before Vincent can investigate, the cannon explodes, forcing Vincent to escape with Yuffie.|$|E

5|$|The show {{ran from}} 2005 until 2010, {{at which point}} he had been {{featured}} for more hours on primetime television than any other magician in history. Other tricks performed in the show included making an elephant <b>disappear</b> <b>and</b> the performance of séances {{as well as other}} tricks in order to teach his audience about con men and how to avoid scams intended to manipulate money out of people.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} Victorville area the scenery changes, as {{suburban}} neighborhoods <b>disappear</b> <b>and</b> the highway traverses the Mojave Desert. While crossing the desert, the route clips the northeastern corner of Edwards Air Force Base. Just past the base the road intersects SR 58 at Kramer Junction. This is currently an at-grade intersection; however, SR58 is gradually being upgraded to a freeway. After leaving Kramer Junction 395 passes the Kramer Junction Solar Electric Generating Station. US395 crosses the Rand and El Paso Mountains, where the highway crosses into San Bernardino–Kern county line, near Johannesburg. While traversing these mountains the route crosses a former Southern Pacific rail line, {{now owned by}} the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) that loosely follows the route of State Route 14 through the Mojave. Though the railroad is abandoned north of Searles Station, US 395 parallels the old railroad grade from this point to Lone Pine.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} ruminants, the infant can stand within 30 minutes of birth. Although {{generally}} similar to adults, newborn calves have false eyelashes, a long dorsal mane and long white hairs in the stripes. These features gradually <b>disappear</b> <b>and</b> {{give way to}} the general appearance within a year. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. The growth rate of calves is appreciably high in {{the first few months of}} birth, after which it gradually declines. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and weaning takes place at six months. Horn development in males takes one year after birth. The okapi's average lifespan is 20 to 30 years.|$|E

5|$|Colony {{collapse}} disorder (CCD) is {{the phenomenon}} {{that occurs when}} the majority of worker bees in a colony <b>disappear</b> <b>and</b> leave behind a queen, plenty of food and a few nurse bees {{to care for the}} remaining immature bees and the queen. While such disappearances have occurred throughout the history of apiculture, and were known by various names (disappearing disease, spring dwindle, May disease, autumn collapse, and fall dwindle disease), the syndrome was renamed colony collapse disorder in late 2006 in conjunction with a drastic {{rise in the number of}} disappearances of western honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies in North America. European beekeepers observed similar phenomena in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, Switzerland and Germany, albeit to a lesser degree, and the Northern Ireland Assembly received reports of a decline greater than 50%.|$|E
5|$|Forum members whose ruses are {{discovered}} by their support groups are frequently banned from such communities—sometimes after demanding that site administrators do so—moving to other websites to display other ailments. Denise Grady noted in The New York Times {{that the woman}} with the eating disorder moved to a group for sexual abuse survivors then another where she claimed to be dying of AIDS. An article in The Weekend Australian highlighted an example of this in 2003: a woman in London admitted to belonging to online support forums dedicated to helping members cope with migraines, grieving over dead children, and breast cancer, all at the same time. She told a psychiatrist that she would study a specific malady and subsequently present herself with its symptoms; her time at each forum followed a daily schedule. Others <b>disappear</b> <b>and</b> simply stop posting, such as the monk who claimed to have cancer.|$|E
5|$|Mace {{discovers the}} fugitives {{and refuses to}} let them go or help find Morrow. The Ghost Rider attacks and defeats Mace, only sparing his life because of Gabe's pleading. Coulson convinces Mace that Robbie can be prosecuted later, and that they need to stop Lucy now. When they find Lucy, Robbie destroys her, but not before she reveals that Morrow wanted the Darkholds power for himself and had {{intentionally}} turned her into this ghostly state. Coulson finds Morrow, to see him attempt an experiment on himself. An energy blast from the experiment makes Coulson, Robbie, and agent Leo Fitz <b>disappear,</b> <b>and</b> Morrow successfully displays the ability to create matter.|$|E

5|$|Sea otters (Enhydra lutris) are {{commonly}} cited {{as an example}} of a keystone species; because, they limit the density of sea urchins that feed on kelp. If sea otters are removed from the system, the urchins graze until the kelp beds <b>disappear,</b> <b>and</b> this has a dramatic effect on community structure. Hunting of sea otters, for example, is thought to have led indirectly to the extinction of the Steller's sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas). While the keystone species concept has been used extensively as a conservation tool, it has been criticized for being poorly defined from an operational stance. It is difficult to experimentally determine what species may hold a keystone role in each ecosystem. Furthermore, food web theory suggests that keystone species may not be common, so it is unclear how generally the keystone species model can be applied.|$|E
5|$|The {{woman is}} {{revealed}} to be a genie. Stokes is angry that he wasted his first two wishes; Stokes had previously wished for his boss to stop talking (which caused Gilmore's mouth to <b>disappear)</b> <b>and</b> for a boat. The boat, however, was not placed in water and Stokes is still forced {{to pay taxes on}} it. The genie suggests that Anson should give his physically handicapped brother the ability to walk as his third wish; but he instead wishes for the ability to be turned invisible. Anson, now invisible, runs out into the street and is killed by a truck as he crosses the road.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} peak intensity, {{an increase}} in wind shear caused the eye to <b>disappear,</b> <b>and</b> the convection decreased significantly. On December1, the IMD estimated Agni weakened to cyclonic storm status, around which time the center became exposed from the convection. The cyclone continued its steady weakening continued due to the wind shear, the presence of dry air, and cooler water temperatures, and by December2, the IMD downgraded Agni to depression status, which was its final warning on the system. As it approached the coast of Somalia, it turned westward due to {{the building of a}} ridge over Saudi Arabia. Despite unfavorable conditions, thunderstorms briefly reformed over the circulation, which allowed the storm to maintain its intensity. By late on December3, Agni weakened to below tropical storm status, and the JTWC issued its final warning while the storm was about 450km (275mi) south-southeast of Cape Guardafui—the easternmost point of the Horn of Africa. The circulation became difficult to locate by early on December4, by which time the system had little remaining convection. It turned southwestward and later to the south, moving ashore on eastern Somalia before dissipating on December5 near Ceel Huur over water.|$|E

5|$|An ice core is a {{vertical}} column through a glacier, sampling the layers that formed through an annual cycle of snowfall and melt. As snow accumulates, each layer presses on lower layers, making them denser until they turn into firn. Firn is not dense {{enough to prevent}} air from escaping; but at a density of about 830kg/m3 it turns to ice, and the air within is sealed into bubbles that capture {{the composition of the}} atmosphere at the time the ice formed. The depth at which this occurs varies with location, but in Greenland and the Antarctic it ranges from 64m to 115m. Because the rate of snowfall varies from site to site, the age of the firn when it turns to ice varies a great deal. At Summit Camp in Greenland, the depth is 77 m and the ice is 230 years old; at Dome C in Antarctica the depth is 95 m and the age 2500 years. As further layers build up, the pressure increases, and at about 1500m the crystal structure of the ice changes from hexagonal to cubic, allowing air molecules to move into the cubic crystals and form a clathrate. The bubbles <b>disappear</b> <b>and</b> the ice becomes more transparent.|$|E
5|$|Besides gyres, {{there are}} {{temporary}} surface currents that occur under specific conditions. When waves meet a shore at an angle, a longshore current is created as water is pushed along {{parallel to the}} coastline. The water swirls up onto the beach {{at right angles to}} the approaching waves but drains away straight down the slope under the effect of gravity. The larger the breaking waves, the longer the beach, and the more oblique the wave's approach, the stronger the longshore current is. These currents can shift great volumes of sand or pebbles, create spits, and make beaches <b>disappear</b> <b>and</b> water channels silt up. A rip current can occur when water piles up near the shore from advancing waves and is funnelled out to sea through a channel in the seabed. It may occur at a gap in a sandbar or near a man-made structure such as a groyne. These strong currents can have a velocity of , can form at different places at different stages of the tide, and can carry away unwary swimmers. Temporary upwelling currents occur when the wind pushes water away from the land and deeper water rises to replace it. This cold water is often rich in nutrients and creates blooms of phytoplankton and a great increase in the productivity of the sea.|$|E
5|$|By 1985, Bobby and Pam {{realize that}} they want to be together. Bobby proposes, Pam accepts and they spend the night together. The next day, Bobby is tragically cut down by a car driven by her half-sister, Katherine Wentworth, and dies hours later, leaving Pam heartbroken. Pam goes on to make {{television}} history by dreaming Bobby's death. Pam awakes and finds Bobby in the shower, alive and well. Pam receives good news {{at the end of the}} 1986–1987 season finale: she is finally able to conceive a baby, after confirming that there would be no health risks involved. However, she never gets that chance. While calling her husband to tell him the good news, she is in a massive auto accident where she hits an oil tanker and is severely burned in a subsequent fire. While recovering from her burns, she decides to get away from the Ewings and everyone else, including her son, <b>disappear</b> <b>and</b> divorce Bobby for a second time.|$|E
