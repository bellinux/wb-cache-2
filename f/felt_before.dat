25|$|Although no foreshocks were {{reported}} <b>felt</b> <b>before</b> the mainshock, a pressure gauge recording card {{at the local}} waterworks showed disturbances beginning at 3:27a.m., which were likely caused by foreshocks. At 6:44a.m. the mainshock occurred which lasted 19 seconds. The epicenter of the earthquake was located in the sea {{off the coast of}} Santa Barbara, in the Santa Barbara Channel. The fault on which it occurred appears to have been an extension of the Mesa fault or the Santa Ynez system. The earthquake was felt from Paso Robles (San Luis Obispo County) to the north to Santa Ana (Orange County) to the south and to Mojave (Kern County) to the east.|$|E

Emma asks {{to speak with}} Regina alone, and tells {{her that if she}} tells Robin the truth about how she feels, {{everything}} will be fixed and they can both get their happy endings with the men they love, acknowledging that she herself never got the chance to tell Hook how she really <b>felt</b> <b>before</b> it was too late. The trio arrive at the chapel to stop the wedding, but before they can do so, Rumple suddenly appears to stop them. Emma and Henry try to distract Rumple as Regina tries to work up the nerve to interrupt the ceremony. Emma engages Rumple in a sword fight, until he is able to knock her out temporarily. He then aims his sword at Henry, but Regina jumps in front of him just in time to take the hit herself, opting to save Henry instead of pursuing Robin. Moments later, Robin and Zelena exit the chapel and Robin rushes to Regina's side as Zelena's envy starts to take over, causing her to start turning green. Robin tells Regina that she won't have to die alone.|$|E

Paul stirred up {{controversy}} when he announced his displeasure with the move, commenting that team management should have [...] "consulted with me and asked how I <b>felt</b> <b>before</b> it happened." [...] In early February, 2010, Paul tore cartilage in his left knee and was sidelined for over a month by surgery, forcing him to miss the All-Star Game. In total, he played in only 45 games and his averages dropped to 18.7 points, 3.8 rebounds, 10.7 assists, and 2.1 steals per game. Without Paul, the Hornets struggled, missing the playoffs.|$|E
500|$|A {{spokesperson}} for Hollyoaks confirmed that Ste didn't realise [...] "how much {{power and control}} Brendan was wielding over him". This was because Ste was still {{coming to terms with}} his sexuality. Ste felt a connection he never <b>felt</b> <b>before</b> because he hadn't had another male partner. Brendan manipulated Ste into believing he was to blame for Brendan's anger. The representative said this was why he ended up apologising. The storyline also aimed to shock viewers with the [...] "dark depths" [...] Brendan would go to in order to control Ste. Marquess later stated that Brendan's past would be explained and that everyone should remember it was Ste who used to hit Amy first, adding: [...] "So it's a dark and interwoven story made all the more complicated by the introduction of a new love interest for Ste".|$|E

[...] Unlike previous Sonic Youth albums, Experimental Jet Set was not ranked in the Top 40 of The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1994, but Christgau placed it at No. 3 in his own [...] "Dean's List". In a retrospective review for About.com, 90s rock expert Melissa Bobbitt wrote: [...] "Though {{it might not be}} as universally celebrated as 1988's Daydream Nation or Dirty, this record represented the triumphant rise of the Alternative Nation and its progressive nature."

At Hole's performance on August 26, 1994 at the Reading Festival— Love's first public performance following her husband's death— she appeared onstage with outstretched arms, mimicking crucifixion.

"A Change in Me" [...] is {{considered}} to be among the musical's original songs that both advance its storyline and provide character development; [...] "A Change in Me" [...] specifically allows Belle to further explore and elaborate on her newfound feelings for the Beast, adding dimension to their relationship. The song also further empowers Belle, expanding upon her dimension as a character. Appearing during the show's second act, the ballad is performed by Belle to indicate that her feelings towards the Beast have softened. Delivered simply, she explains to her father Maurice that she no longer longs for the things she had wished for earlier in Act 1's [...] "Belle (Reprise)", revealing just how much her time spent in the Beast's castle has transformed both her identity and perspective. Belle claims that she has evolved into a better person as a result of having gotten to know and ultimately fallen in love with the Beast, the same individual she once viewed [...] "with abhorrence and dread". Forced to confront feelings she has never <b>felt</b> <b>before,</b> Belle tries to convince Maurice that the Beast is not the monster he thinks he is while explaining how much she has matured. According to Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle, [...] "A Change in Me" [...] "encapsulate the show's sweet emotion."

2500|$|In conclusion, a {{cheating}} partner {{can cause}} {{problems for the}} innocent partner-- not just after the infidelity has been discovered, but through every stage. The suspicion <b>felt</b> <b>before</b> creates paranoia, angry bursts, anxiety and insights jealousy.

2500|$|The song has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from music critics. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave the song a [...] "D+" [...] rating, he remarked [...] "The lyrics are generalized banalities (I never lived before your love/I never <b>felt</b> <b>before</b> your touch), the melodies destined to endure as wedding songs or florist ads. A choir {{at the end}} of [...] "A Moment Like This" [...] is meant to indicate earthiness; the gentle acoustic guitar throughout [...] "Before Your Love," [...] sensitivity."

2500|$|... 1929 is {{regarded}} as a turning point by French historians, who point out that it was last year in which prosperity was <b>felt</b> <b>before</b> the effects of the Great Depression. The Third Republic had been in power since before World War I. On July 24, French prime minister Raymond Poincaré resigned for medical reasons; he was succeeded by Aristide Briand. Briand adopted a foreign policy of both peace and defensive fortification. The Kellogg–Briand Pact, renouncing war as an instrument of foreign policy, went into effect in this year (it was first signed in Paris in 1928 by most leading world powers). The French began work on the Maginot Line in this year, as a defense against a possible German attack, and on September 5 Briand presented a plan for the United States of Europe. On October 22, Briand was replaced as Prime Minister by André Tardieu. Primo de Rivera's dictatorship in Spain experienced growing dissatisfaction among students and academics, as well as businessmen who blamed the government for recent economic woes. Many called for a fascist regime, like that in Italy.|$|E
