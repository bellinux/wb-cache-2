5|$|If we were {{to regard}} Sirius and Procyon as double stars, the change of their motions would not {{surprise}} us; we should acknowledge them as necessary, and <b>have</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> investigate their amount by observation. But light is no real property of mass. The existence of numberless visible stars can prove nothing against the existence of numberless invisible ones.|$|E
5|$|A graphic {{description}} of the nuckelavee as it appears on land was given by an islander {{who claimed to have}} had a confrontation with it, but accounts describing the details of the creature's appearance are inconsistent. In common with many other sea monsters it is unable to tolerate fresh water, therefore those it is pursuing <b>have</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> cross a river or stream to be rid of it. The nuckelavee is kept in confinement during the summer months by the Mither o' the Sea, an ancient Orcadian spirit, and the only one able to control it.|$|E
5|$|Traveling across Filgaia, {{the heroes}} {{make their way}} to the long-abandoned Guardian Temple to gain the {{alliance}} of the mystical guardians who maintain the forces of nature across the planet. There they are tested individually. After each of them fails their personal tests of character, the Guardians reluctantly agree to aid them. The Guardians tell Rudy and his companions that the demons have already begun to revive their leader, and <b>have</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> lift the seal on her cocoon-like prison by destroying the three scattered statues that lie across Filgaia. Utilizing ancient Elw technology in the form of teleportation devices, the group travels the world to stop the Quarter Knights from destroying the statues, but they fail in each attempt. The consequent resurrection of Mother occurs, yet the demons are informed by their leader that it is her intention to eradicate Filgaia rather than subjugate it and tells her followers that their own deaths will follow soon after.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} {{approaches}} to this issue. One {{approach is to}} argue that all real forces drop off with distance from their sources in a known manner, so we <b>have</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> be sure that a body is {{far enough away from}} all sources to ensure that no force is present. A possible issue with this approach is the historically long-lived view that the distant universe might affect matters (Mach's principle). Another approach is to identify all real sources for real forces and account for them. A possible issue with this approach is that we might miss something, or account inappropriately for their influence, perhaps, again, due to Mach's principle and an incomplete understanding of the universe. A third approach {{is to look at the}} way the forces transform when we shift reference frames. Fictitious forces, those that arise due to the acceleration of a frame, disappear in inertial frames, and have complicated rules of transformation in general cases. On the basis of universality of physical law and the request for frames where the laws are most simply expressed, inertial frames are distinguished by the absence of such fictitious forces.|$|E
500|$|When Kinne {{failed to}} appear {{for the murder}} of her husband, a warrant was issued for her arrest in October 1964. [...] It is still {{outstanding}} 53 years later—making it the oldest outstanding murder warrant known to exist in the Kansas City area. Kinne's status in the Mexican system also remains outstanding, though authorities have pointed out {{that at the time of}} her escape, jailbreak was not a crime under Mexican law; if she were re-captured there, she would <b>have</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> serve out the remainder of her outstanding sentence.|$|E

Operating in and through these qualities was his own extensive knowledge of human nature and life. No Shakespearean critic or editor has ever approached him in this respect.|$|E

500|$|Toscanini, Beecham {{and many}} others {{regarded}} Sargent as the finest choral conductor in the world. Even orchestral musicians gave him credit: the principal violist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra wrote of him, [...] "He is able to instil into the singers a life and efficiency they never dreamed of. You <b>have</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> see {{the eyes of a}} choral society screwing into him like hundreds of gimlets to understand what he means to them." [...] However, another of Sargent's colleagues, Sir Adrian Boult, said of him, [...] "e was a great all-rounder but never developed his potentialities, which were enormous, simply because he didn't think hard enough about music – he never troubled to improve on a successful interpretation. He was too interested in other things, and not single-minded enough about music." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{then went}} out on a rainy night and [...] "to make her clothes heavy with water, she {{walked up and down}} about half an hour" [...] before jumping into the River Thames, but a {{stranger}} saw her jump and rescued her. Wollstonecraft considered her suicide attempt deeply rational, writing after her rescue, I <b>have</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> lament, that, when the bitterness of death was past, I was inhumanly brought back to life and misery. But a fixed determination is not to be baffled by disappointment; nor will I allow that to be a frantic attempt, {{which was one of the}} calmest acts of reason. In this respect, I am only accountable to myself. Did I care for what is termed reputation, it is by other circumstances that I should be dishonoured.|$|E

2500|$|Socrates {{responds}} to this sophistical paradox with a mythos (poetic story) {{according to which}} souls are immortal and have learned everything prior to transmigrating into the human body. [...] Since the soul has had contact with real things prior to birth, we <b>have</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> 'recollect' them when alive. [...] Such recollection requires Socratic questioning, which according to Socrates is not teaching. [...] Socrates demonstrates his method of questioning and recollection by interrogating a slave who is ignorant of geometry.|$|E
2500|$|Rundstedt, {{like most}} German officers, had favoured {{the policy of}} good {{relations}} with the Soviets followed by the Reichswehr commander General Hans von Seekt during the Weimar Republic years, when the Soviet connection was seen as a counter to the threat from Poland. He was also apprehensive about launching a new war in the east while Britain was undefeated. If so, he did nothing to oppose them, and in this he was in company even with officers who disliked and opposed Hitler's regime, such as Halder, who threw themselves into planning the invasion, and believed it would succeed. Even the most experienced officers shared Hitler's contempt for the Soviet state and army. [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> kick in the door," [...] Hitler told Rundstedt, [...] "and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 7:30 a.m., {{the entire}} Confederate Defense Fleet had been destroyed, as the {{converted}} steamboats proved {{no match for}} the powerful Federal ironclads and rams, resulting in the immediate surrender of the city of Memphis to Union forces within a few hours. The Benton dropped anchor and sent her gig to retrieve a well dressed man standing near the shore waving a white flag. Phelps brought the man aboard to see commander Flag Officer Davis for a conference. After their meeting Phelps accompanied the man back and proceeded into town with an official request for surrender, and was met with jeers from some of the crowd, but without further incident. Phelps handed the notice to Mayor John Park, who replied: [...] "Your note of this date is received and the contents noted. on reply, I <b>have</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> say, that as the city authorities have no means of defense, by the force of circumstances the city is in your hands." [...] Phelps was promoted to Lieutenant Commander in July 1862.|$|E

2500|$|Imprisoned oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky {{has claimed}} that the protests were inspired, at least in part, by {{the example of the}} Arab Spring. He told The Guardian, [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> reflect on the events in {{countries}} swept up in the Arab Spring to recognise the transformation taking place in the compact between the rulers and the ruled. While there are certainly many differences between those countries and Russia, there are some fundamental similarities." [...] In March 2012 Sergei Mironov, running for the presidency of Russia, also compared the situation to the Arab Spring, saying that: [...] "Whoever wins the presidency, if he does not immediately begin deep political and social reforms [...] Russia will be shaken by a kind of Arab Spring within two years." [...] The Telegraph pointed out that since Mironov is a former ally of Vladimir Putin, he could have been trying to scaremonger [...] "as a subtle way of endorsing a crackdown on street demonstrations that are expected {{in the days after the}} vote".|$|E
2500|$|Zangi did {{not offer}} long resistance. He was unpopular with his {{subjects}} and wished {{to return to his}} Sinjar, the city he governed previously. An exchange was negotiated where Zangi would hand over Aleppo to Saladin in return for the restoration of his control of Sinjar, Nusaybin, and Raqqa. Zangi would hold these territories as Saladin's vassals on terms of military service. On 12 June, Aleppo was formally placed in Ayyubid hands. The people of Aleppo had not known about these negotiations and were taken by surprise when Saladin's standard was hoisted over the citadel. Two emirs, including an old friend of Saladin, Izz al-Din Jurduk, welcomed and pledged their service to him. Saladin replaced the Hanafi courts with Shafi'i administration, despite a promise he would not interfere in the religious leadership of the city. Although he was short of money, Saladin also allowed the departing Zangi to take all the stores of the citadel that he could travel with and to sell the remainder—which Saladin purchased himself. In spite of his earlier hesitation to go through with the exchange, he had no doubts about his success, stating that Aleppo was [...] "the key to the lands" [...] and [...] "this city is the eye of Syria and the citadel is its pupil." [...] For Saladin, the capture of the city marked the end of over eight years of waiting since he told Farrukh-Shah that [...] "we <b>have</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> do the milking and Aleppo will be ours".|$|E
2500|$|Beresford {{wrote to}} Fitzwilliam on 22 June that his {{character}} had been unjustly attacked: [...] "Direct and specific charges I could fairly have met and refuted, but crooked and undefined insinuations against private character, through {{the pretext of}} official discussion, your Lordship must allow, are the weapons of a libeller". Fitzwilliam replied the next day that domestic matters took charge of his attention but on 28 June that he let Beresford know he was now in town and [...] "As I could not misunderstand the object of your letter, I <b>have</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> signify that I am ready to attend your call". Rumours of the impending duel leaked and Fitzwilliam was [...] "obliged to quit the house...hastily in the morning, for fear of arrest by the police". His second, Lord George Cavendish, met Beresford's second (Sir George Montgomery) on 28 June and debated an apology by Fitzwilliam. His proposed apology was not acceptable to Beresford. Their first arena, Marylebone fields, was crowded with prospective spectators so they moved to a field near Paddington. As Beresford and Fitzwilliam were taking their marks a magistrate ran onto the field and arrested Fitzwilliam. Fitzwilliam said to Beresford [...] "that we have been prevented from finishing this business in the manner I wished, I have no scruple to make an apology". Beresford accepted and they shook hands, with Fitzwilliam saying [...] "Now, thank God, there is a complete end to my Irish administration" [...] and hoped that [...] "whenever they met it {{might be on the}} footing of friends". Burke wrote to Lord John Cavendish on 1 July that [...] "it is happy, that a Virtuous man has escaped with Life and honour—and that his reputation for spirit and humanity, and true dignity must stand higher than ever, if higher it could stand".|$|E
