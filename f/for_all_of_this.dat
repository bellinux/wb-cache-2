5|$|Glinda and Elphaba {{meet again}} at the site where Nessarose has been crushed by {{a house with a}} girl named Dorothy inside. Fueled by the rivalry over Fiyero, the two have a heated argument. The guards arrive, and Elphaba guesses that Glinda {{arranged}} <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this.</b> Fiyero arrives as well, and holds Glinda hostage until Elphaba can escape. Glinda realizes that Fiyero does truly love Elphaba, and tells the guards not to hurt him, but they don't listen as they escort Fiyero to the field where they can interrogate him into revealing where Elphaba has fled to so they can recapture her. Elphaba tries to cast a spell to save his life and protect him from injury, but is frustrated by the limitations of her power. She decides that from this point on, she will live up to her reputation as the Wicked Witch of the West ("No Good Deed").|$|E
5|$|Kentish {{manufacture}} before 600 included glass beakers and jewelry. Kentish jewellers {{were highly}} skilled, {{and before the}} end of the sixth century they gained access to gold. Goods from Kent are found in cemeteries across the channel and as far away as at the mouth of the Loire. It is not known what Kent traded <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> wealth, although it seems likely that there was a flourishing slave trade. It may well be that this wealth was the foundation of Æthelberht's strength, although his overlordship and the associated right to demand tribute would have brought wealth in its turn.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{planned for}} December, {{a variety of}} {{problems}} delayed the first Steinbock raid until the night of 21/22 January 1944. Using every trick the RAF had developed, Luftwaffe pathfinders dropped white marker flares along the route and marked London in green. Throughout the raid the attackers dropped large quantities of Düppel, which successfully jammed the 1.5m band radars. A number of newer centrimetric sets had recently been deployed, and these were able to continue guiding the fighters {{to the best of}} their abilities given operator overload. Mosquitos of ADGB claimed 16 bombers destroyed or probable, while the new centimetric guided anti-aircraft artillery added another 9. A further 18 German aircraft never returned, having become lost or crashing while landing. This represented about 10% of the attacking force of 447 bombers. This sort of loss exchange ratio was greater than the Luftwaffe typically managed to achieve against the RAF, and great enough that continued missions with these sorts of losses would quickly deplete the force. <b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> effort, the bombers dropped a total of only 30 tons on the city, causing 14 killed and 74 injured, a tiny fraction of the nightly load during The Blitz. Hitler was apoplectic.|$|E

Nevertheless, he came to define this position as [...] "a bad solution", and, as Maiorescu and Ionescu formed an alliance, he successfully requested appointment from Bădărău, eventually obtaining it through the means of a decree signed by King Carol I. Caragiale later commented: [...] " [...] entrusted me with this golden key, which I had wanted for so long, and which, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> I had not been desperate to obtain." [...] This contradicted another one of his accounts, in which he confessed that, initially received with indifference by Bădărău, he had claimed that him joining the Conservative-Democrats had been Ion Luca's dying request.

She was far from pretty, and her manner were not suited to her rank. But, which fully atoned <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> she was good-tempered, much loved by those in her service, and scrupulous in fulfilling the duties of wife and mother.

2500|$|In a 1999 article, “A Book that Made a Difference,” {{author and}} {{attorney}} Dale Carpenter {{noted that in}} the 1990s, the defining gay political causes were not revolutionary in nature but instead “sought to weave gays into the larger fabric of American life” and that “No author better crystallized this deep and widespread yearning than Bruce Bawer in... A Place at the Table, the decade's most important book on the gay movement.” The book, claimed Carpenter, “articulated better than any book before or since gays' rightful place in our culture” and “fueled a self-conscious movement of gay moderates and conservatives that is still redirecting gay politics.” Largely {{as a result of}} Bawer's book, a “new generation” of gays entered politics and “insisted that gay organizations put issues like marriage {{at the top of the}} agenda.” To be sure, “A Place at the Table wasn't solely responsible <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this...</b> But the book brought it together, nurtured it, and sent it on its way. Bawer's world, to a very large extent, is now our world; his methods, our methods; his goals, our goals. He wrote the book of the decade and changed gay politics forever.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Common to {{the trilogy}} was a {{somewhat}} morbid {{look at the}} history of the Russian monarchy of the previous three centuries, where, as the author saw it, all the efficient rulers happened to be evil, and all the 'good' ones proved to be inefficient. The three stories of three different historical figures had similarly didactic finales: [...] "God help you, Tsar Ivan, and God forgive us all! That's the fate autocracy deserved! Here's the result of our disintegration!" [...] (Zakharyin's words over Ivan the Terrible's dead body), [...] "I am to blame <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this...</b> Oh God, why did you make me Tsar?!" [...] (Tsar Fyodor), [...] "What Evil spawns is only more evil and nothing else." [...] (Boris Godunov). All three parts of the trilogy, which, according to Nestor Kotlyarevsky, were [...] "united by the idea of tragedy being intrinsic to Tsarist power in Russia," [...] had serious problems with the censorship. The trilogy continued to divide opinion in Russia up until 1917. Not long before the Revolution, in Alexandrinsky Theatre the public reacted to Tsar Boris in an overtly political fashion. Monarchists applauded Boris Godunov's words, the left [...] "supported" [...] boyarin Sitsky, seeing in him a fighter of despotism.|$|E
