5|$|Hoshino {{commented that}} most of her ideas for the series come after falling asleep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bath</b> for six hours. An {{exception}} occurs in the plot for second volume of the series, {{which is based on}} a Noh play called Koi no Omoni. As she works, she enjoys listening to Final Fantasy soundtracks, Dragon Ball CDs, the bands Porno Graffitti, L'Arc-en-Ciel, and jazz music.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Stafford {{said there}} were good and bad points to working closely with Weston. His {{knowledge}} of her {{made it easy for}} him to arrange her music, but sometimes it caused difficulties. Weston knew Stafford's abilities and would write or arrange elaborate music because he knew she was capable of performing it. She also said she did not believe she could perform in Broadway musicals because she thought her voice was not powerful enough for stage work. In 2003, she recalled that there was often limited rehearsal time before she recorded a song, and how Weston would sometimes slip musical arrangements under the bathroom door as she was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bath</b> {{getting ready to go to}} the studio.|$|E

He {{was arrested on}} {{suspicion}} of her murder, but not charged with any offence. An inquest later determined that Collins {{had died of a}} drug overdose and severe burns from hot water. In April that year, Speight was reported missing and was later discovered to have taken his own life by hanging himself near Paddington station. Two suicide notes were discovered, describing how he could no longer live without Collins.|$|E
5|$|Lord Rosebery had {{purchased}} Craigiehall {{as a home}} for his second son Neil Primrose MP, {{who was killed in}} Gaza during the First World War. In 1926 Rosebery therefore decided to lease the house and policies, although the agricultural lands continue to be farmed as part of Lord Rosebery's neighbouring Dalmeny estate. The lease was taken by Mr James Morton, an Edinburgh textile manufacturer, who commissioned Robert Lorimer to make various alterations, the property having stood empty for ten years. Lorimer added the oriel window on the south front, and modernised many of Bruce's remaining interiors. A water turbine was constructed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bath</b> house to provide electricity.|$|E
5|$|Series 6 {{began on}} 26 September 1998 and {{began with the}} leprechaun Mr Onion being {{temporarily}} written out of the show after supposedly being swept down the plughole <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bath.</b> This was done intentionally as puppeteer John Eccleston was in Australia filming for Farscape for the year {{and would not be}} available. To compensate for Eccleston's absence, a new leprechaun puppet was added called 'Shamrock' (voiced by Rebecca Nagan of Rosie and Jim fame) who made her debut {{at the end of the}} first show as their long lost sister. She then became a regular fixture from the following week and performed alongside Mr Sage for the rest of the series as a replacement to Mr Onion.|$|E

5|$|Several foods have an {{association}} with the city. Sally Lunn buns (a type of teacake) have long been baked in Bath. They were first mentioned by name in verses printed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bath</b> Chronicle, in 1772. At that time they were eaten hot at public breakfasts in Spring Gardens. They can be eaten with sweet or savoury toppings and are sometimes confused with Bath buns, which are smaller, round, very sweet and very rich. They {{were associated with the}} city following The Great Exhibition. Bath buns were originally topped with crushed comfits created by dipping caraway seeds repeatedly in boiling sugar; but today seeds are added to a 'London Bath Bun' (a reference to the bun's promotion and sale at the Great Exhibition). The seeds may be replaced by crushed sugar granules or 'nibs'.|$|E
5|$|Things {{apparently}} get better: {{the flat}} is tidy, Tom is smartly dressed and clean-shaven. Gerri is happily chatting to him. Tom answers {{the door to}} Stevie, who asks Tom {{to come back to}} work. He is alarmed to see Tom call Gerri; Stevie says that Gerri was killed in a car accident, and that Tom went back to work too soon. Stevie heads to the bathroom to get Tom's medication, but freezes when he sees the corpse of Migg <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bath.</b> Tom tells him not to worry, and that Migg is not real. He invites Stevie to stay for coffee, saying Gerri is just boiling the kettle.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the evidence of witnesses and CCTV cameras, there was substantial forensic evidence linking him to the murders. Investigators found over a dozen bloodstains on his car, on his clothing and in his flat, all matching the victims. There were bloodstains on the boots with which he had kicked both Corcoran and Jordan, which he was still wearing {{at the time of}} his arrest. Smith had tried to clean his clothes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bath</b> of his flat along with a pair of trousers belonging to Corcoran, and a bag containing items belonging to Hyde was discovered outside. Detectives matched the tyre marks from his car, which had four different types of tyre, to the Worcestershire murder scene and to Corcoran's body, over which he had driven. Paintwork and fragments of glass found on Jordan's body matched those from Smith's car, including a broken light cluster which he had thrown into the car's boot.|$|E

When she comes home, she blackmails David and tells Victoria that she slept with him but later admits that she lied. Amy, Val and Eric move into their new home at the barn conversion but her happiness is short-lived as a young man from her past, Jared, tracks her down. He threatens to tell her new family and friends about her past and demands money to keep quiet until Zak Dingle (Steve Halliwell) intervenes, realizing something is wrong. She tells Zak about her past and makes him promise to keep quiet. She pays Jared but when threatened by Zak, he reveals that Amy's affair with his father caused his family to break down. Zak makes Jared leave but Amy discovers she is pregnant and tells Cain, who demands she have a termination.

On Christmas Day 2011, Amy is bathing Kyle but freezes when she remembers her mother dropping her <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bath</b> and giving her to social services. Amy runs away, leaving Kyle with Val, and confides in Victoria who helps her decide to give Kyle up for adoption. Val is upset by Amy's decision and that Eric is supporting her, making them drift apart. Val tries to win Amy back with a family trip to Portugal but goes alone and clears the bank account. Amy is upset when Eric begins dating Brenda Walker (Lesley Dunlop) and attempts to keep them apart; however, she realizes how happy Brenda makes Eric and supports the relationship.|$|E

50|$|Rectangular halls {{connected}} to the hemicycle have been suggested to be libraries because of their similar set-up to those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baths</b> of Caracalla. Historians, to support this theory, have demonstrated that these halls with their niches could properly house books from that day. References {{to the presence of}} libraries within <b>the</b> <b>Baths</b> of Diocletian both confirm and contradict themselves, such as the case of the author of the life of Probus. In it, he mentions that part of the Bibliotheca Ulpia, which are found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Forum of Trajan, are being housed within the baths; a statement he later contradicts when later referencing the Bibliotheca Ulpia. However, with the presence of similar rooms that suggest that they were libraries found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baths</b> of Caracalla and <b>the</b> <b>Baths</b> of Trajan, it is not a stretch to theorize that <b>the</b> <b>baths</b> of Diocletian contained a library.|$|R

50|$|During World War II (for Japan 1941-1945), many Japanese {{cities were}} damaged.

Furthermore, as most houses were damaged or destroyed, few people had access to a private bath, resulting in a great increase <b>in</b> customers for <b>the</b> <b>bath</b> houses. New buildings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> post war period also often lacked baths or showers, leading to a strong increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of public baths. In 1965 many baths also added showerheads to <b>the</b> faucets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>baths.</b> <b>The</b> number of public baths in Japan peaked around 1970.|$|R
