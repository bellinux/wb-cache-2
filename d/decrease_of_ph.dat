30|$|Liao et al.[70] {{observed}} a pH < 6. There {{is a slight}} increase in the uptake of R with the <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> <b>pH</b> because the solubility of R is dependent on pH; due to the weak acidity of R, the solubility of R decreases with the <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> <b>pH.</b> The adsorption onto AC suggested that the uptake of phenolic derivatives was inversely proportional to solubility[118]; thus, the uptake of R on MWCNTs increased with the <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> <b>pH.</b> Lin and Xing[75] have conducted experiments for the adsorption of P, C, and pyrogallol onto CNTs over a range of pH. It was found that the final solution pH (4.0 to 6.5) was lower than the pKa of the phenolics and close to the point of zero charge (pHPZC) of CNTs, which suggested that phenolics used for adsorption should be primarily in neutral form. Therefore, electrostatic interaction might not greatly influence the sorption of phenolics to CNTs in the weakly acidic environment. Sorption was found to increase sharply from P to C and then to pyrogallol, while their hydrophobicity decreased. Thus, the hydrophobic interaction can be insignificant as a major influencing factor regulating the sorption of these phenolics to CNTs.|$|E

40|$|A {{major factor}} in {{secondary}} brain injury following cerebral trauma is accumulation of lactic acid resulting in glial swelling. Further, evidence obtained in this context demonstrates activation of protein kinase C (PKC) under these circumstances. Glial swelling from acidosis is attributable to activation of the Na+/H+-exchanger, mediating influx of Na+-ions {{in exchange for the}} extrusion of H+ ions. The antiporter is activated following phosphorylation by PKC. The current study was made to elucidate the role of PKC activation in acidosis-induced glial swelling. For that purpose, suspended C 6 glioma cells were used to examine changes of the cell volume and intracellular pH (pHi). Acidosis was induced by administration of isotonic lactic acid. Stimulation of PKC by the phorbolester PMA was significantly enhancing glial swelling from severe acidosis (pH 6. 2), whereas the <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> <b>pH</b> 1 was somewhat attenuated. On the other side, inhibition of PKC by staurosporine did not affect cell swelling nor the <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> <b>pH,</b> from acidosis.

40|$|The acidity of {{precipitation}} {{has been observed}} at stations of the Acid Rain Monitoring Network run by the China Meteorological Administration (CMA-ARMN) since 1992. Previous {{studies have shown that}} different long-term trends exist in different regions but detailed analysis of the causes of these is lacking. In this paper, we analyze summertime precipitation acidity data from the CMA-ARMN during 1992 – 2006 using EOFs and show that the summertime pH in China had different trends before and after 2000. The most significant <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> <b>pH</b> is found in Central China. To investigate the causes of this <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> <b>pH</b> in summer, we explore the relationship between changes in the pH value, the East Asian summer monsoon index, rainfall data, and pollutants emissions. We find that the East Asian summer monsoon can significantly affect the acidity of summer precipitation in Central China. In strong monsoon years, the pH in Central China is about 0. 33 lower than that in weak monsoon years. Chemical transport model simulations using fixed emissions indicate that about 65 % of the pH value difference (i. e., 0. 22) is related to the summer monsoon, and constitutes 18 – 36 % of the observed pH change (0. 6 – 1. 2) in Central China during 1992 – 2006. Further studies reveal a teleconnection between the pH in Central China and the rainfall in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MLYR), which can explain about 24 % of the variance of pH in Central China. Simulations using an annually varying emission inventory show that at least 60 % of the variation in precipitation acidity in Central China can be attributed to changes in pollutant emissions. Therefore, the increase in emissions of acidic species is the most important cause for the observed <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> <b>pH</b> in Central China, and changes in meteorological factors, such as rainfall and other parameters related to the East Asian summer monsoon, play a less important but still significant role...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this study was to {{investigate}} how different decreasing of pH regimes during microencapsulation process with melamine-formaldehyde (MF) resin affects the composition, morphology and thermal stability of microcapsules containing a phase-change material (PCM). Technical butyl stearate was used as PCM. Microencapsulation was carried out at 70 °C. For all experiments the starting pH value was 6. 0. After one hour of microencapsulation at the starting pH value, the pH value was lowered to final pH value (5. 5; 5. 0; 4. 5) in a stepwise or linear way. The properties of microcapsules were monitored during and after the microencapsulation process. The results showed that pH value decreasing regime was critical for the morphology and stability of microcapsules. During microencapsulations with a stepwise <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> <b>pH</b> value we observed faster increase of the amount of MF resin in the microencapsulation product compared to the microencapsulations with a linear pH value decrease. However, faster deposition in the case of microencapsulations with stepwise <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> <b>pH</b> value did not result in thicker MF shells. The shell thickness increased much faster when the pH value was decreased in a linear way or in several smaller steps.
