5|$|His ruse revealed, Redheffer {{immediately}} {{departed for}} New York City {{where he was}} still unknown. He changed <b>his</b> <b>machine</b> somewhat {{so that it could}} not be detected as easily, and he exhibited it as he had done in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Redheffer {{moved to}} New York City {{and set up}} a similar scam after {{rebuilding}} <b>his</b> <b>machine.</b> However, an engineer detected that it was a fake by listening to its unsteady motions at an exhibition. He discovered that the machine was operated by a man using a crank in a room on the floor above. Redheffer returned to Philadelphia. He later claimed to have created another machine, but refused to demonstrate it to anyone. He managed to get a patent for <b>his</b> <b>machine</b> in 1820, but after this his fate is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Though {{production}} of hammered coinage ceased in France in 1645, edge lettering wasn't immediately reintroduced to that nation's milled coinage. At some point prior to 1679, Jean Castaing, a French engineer, invented a machine to apply edge lettering to coins, and in 1685, {{he approached the}} French government with a proposal to use <b>his</b> <b>machine</b> in that nation's mints. King Louis XIV favoured the invention, but his financial minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, believed {{that it would not}} be economically viable to pay the expenses required to put it into use. In 1686, over Colbert's objection, the French Council of State entered a contract with Castaing wherein all of the nation's gold and silver coinage would include edge lettering created by <b>his</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E

50|$|As World War II approached, {{and with}} his own {{sporting}} success ad that of <b>his</b> <b>machines</b> fading, Baughan focused his skills on the production of aircraft parts.|$|R
5|$|Charles Redheffer and <b>his</b> <b>machine</b> became {{well known}} in Philadelphia in 1812. Redheffer claimed he had invented a {{perpetual}} motion machine and exhibited it in a house near the Schuylkill River in {{the outskirts of the}} city. He charged an admission fee of $5 (some sources claim $1) for men to view it; depending on the source, women were admitted free or at a charge of $1. The machine caused a sensation, and Redheffer lobbied for funds to build a larger version.|$|E
5|$|Charles Redheffer was an American {{inventor}} {{who claimed}} to have invented a perpetual motion machine. First appearing in Philadelphia, Redheffer exhibited <b>his</b> <b>machine</b> to the public, charging high prices for viewing. When he applied to the government for more money, a group of inspectors were sent to examine the machine. It was discovered the machine was actually powered by a device Redheffer claimed was powered by the machine.|$|E
5|$|Little {{has been}} {{recorded}} about Redheffer's life, other than his connection to the hoax. According to one source, he was from Germantown in Philadelphia, but most sources simply state that he appeared in Philadelphia with <b>his</b> <b>machine.</b> Redheffer disappeared from public view after {{the discovery of the}} fraud, and his fate is unknown.|$|E
5000|$|In their mature form, McTammany voting {{machines}} {{were used in}} a number of jurisdictions in the United States. McTammany received legislative approval for limited use of <b>his</b> <b>machines</b> in Massachusetts in 1893, {{but it was not until}} 1896 that <b>his</b> <b>machines</b> saw widespread use in that state. Connecticut approved use of the McTammany machine in 1895. [...] In Rhode Island, the question of whether a vote on the McTammany machine met the legal definition of a ballot went all the way to the state supreme court in 1895.|$|R

5|$|Mälzel {{eventually}} {{took the}} Turk {{on his second}} tour to Havana, Cuba. In Cuba, Schlumberger died of yellow fever, leaving Mälzel without a director for <b>his</b> <b>machine.</b> Dejected, Mälzel died at sea in 1838 {{at the age of}} 66 during his return trip, leaving his machinery with the ship captain.|$|E
5|$|An {{attempt to}} open a sealed chamber using a Borazon drill fails to make progress. However, a few moments after the drill is stopped, a small hole is seen, though the drill operator, Sladden (Duncan Lamont), is certain it was not created by <b>his</b> <b>machine.</b> The hole widens to reveal the corpses of three-legged, insectoid creatures with horned heads. Roney and Judd work to {{preserve}} the bodies before they decay. An examination of the creatures' physiology suggests {{they came from the}} planet Mars. Quatermass and Roney note the similarity between the appearance of the creatures and images of the Devil.|$|E
5|$|As the Ju 87s {{reached the}} coast, the {{respective}} groups split off {{and headed for}} their assigned targets. By this time, some 15 miles off the Isle of Wight, the Bf 109s had caught up and were now zigzagging around the dive-bombers. Bode led III./StG 77 to attack from the northwest, dead into wind in order to bomb accurately. Usually the Ju 87s attacked in line astern, but Bode chose to attack in groups of three to split the anti-aircraft fire. To keep the enemy's heads down, he fired <b>his</b> <b>machine</b> guns in an 80-degree dive. He soon left an altitude of 13,000feet, releasing his bombs and pulling out at 2,275feet. The rest of his unit followed.|$|E

5|$|McCudden was {{determined}} <b>his</b> <b>machine</b> {{would remain in}} first-class fighting order. He spent three days working with his fitters and armourers, stripping down the Vickers gun's synchronising gear, firing at the butts and making eight test flights shooting at ground targets. His armourers joked that his guns would never work in the air if he wore {{them out on the}} ground. He continued to experience jams and his unclaimed victim of 14 September 1917—Ernst Wiegand—was able to escape and crash-land wounded in German territory thanks to another stoppage. Since his crash was not witnessed his claim went uncredited.|$|E
5|$|On 18 August 1917 McCudden scored {{his first}} victory as an {{official}} member of 56 Squadron over an Albatros D.V. Another the following day and two on 20 August raised his tally from 7 to 11 victories. He was pleased with his success but berated the armourers for the frequent gun-stoppages. Over the next four weeks <b>his</b> <b>machine</b> suffered engine difficulties and gun-jams. He could only claim damaged enemy aircraft and once suffered a galling experience when the DFW C.V reconnaissance he was attacking holed his engine while his guns jammed. It had to be sent for major repairs. He received a new fighter, B4863, which then became his regular mount.|$|E
5|$|On September 14, 1951, PFC Edward Gomez (1932–1951), an Ammunition Bearer in Company E, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines, 1st Marine Division, voluntarily {{moved down}} an {{abandoned}} trench {{to search for}} a new location for <b>his</b> <b>machine</b> gun and, when a hostile grenade landed between himself and his weapon, he shouted a warning to those around him as he grasped the activated charge in his hand. Determined to save his comrades, he unhesitatingly chose to sacrifice himself and, diving into a ditch with the deadly missile, absorbed the violence of the explosion in his own body.|$|E

5|$|Steiner, Mitchell, and Hill {{feel they}} are ready to present, but at the event, Blanchard places acid on the machine when {{everyone}} is unaware, causing an explosion. The funding for Steiner's project is ended instantly, however, Mitchell later discovers that the device has been tampered with. Steiner goes to Blanchard's house, where Lembach and Latham are having dinner. He presents the men with the evidence that <b>his</b> <b>machine</b> was deliberately tampered with, and Lembach allows him to have another chance. Steiner decides to try to project himself to Lembach's house, and, with help from his secretary, Sheila (Tracey Crisp), he begins the procedure. However, right then, Mitchell and Hill return to the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|During the Catalonia Offensive in January 1939, the Junkers Ju 87 {{returned}} to Spain. On {{the morning of}} 21 January 1939, 34 Heinkel He 111, along with some escorts and three Ju 87B, attacked the Port of Barcelona, five days before the city was captured by the Fascists. 29 Republican fighters were defending the city. There were more than 100 aircraft operating over the city and, while a Ju 87 was dive-bombing a ship, a Republican Polikarpov I-15 pilot, Francisco Alférez Jiménez, claimed it destroyed near el Vendrell, in Coma-ruga, but the Stuka was capable of landing on the beach without crashing. That {{was the only time}} a Stuka attacked the capital of Catalonia. On 24 January 1939, a group of Stukas prevented the destruction of a bridge near Barcelona by strafing the demolition engineers on Molins de Rei. During the attack the Republican ground defenders, equipped with a quadruple PM M1910 mounting, hit one pilot (Heinz Bohne) in both legs and the Stuka crashed, seriously injuring Bohne, and <b>his</b> <b>machine</b> gunner, Albert Conrad. Those two were the only Stuka casualties of the war.|$|E
5|$|McCudden set {{out across}} the English Channel. Unsure of the dispositions on the ground after the German advance he checked the {{airfield}} he suspected to be Boffles but found it empty. Flying in heavy mist he decided to head to Auxi-le-Château, France, to get directions from the RAF personnel stationed there. He approached Corporal W.H. Burdett and L. E Vallins of 52 Squadron. Burdett had served with McCudden in 3 Squadron back in 1915. Burdett did not recognise him in his flying gear. They marked his map and McCudden returned to <b>his</b> <b>machine.</b> Around 90 seconds after takeoff from Auxi-le-Château, the S.E.5a plunged into the ground. 8 Squadron's Corporal W.H. Howard was on the scene within minutes and fought through the fire to free McCudden who was lying {{next to one of}} the wings—he had not worn his safety belt. Burdett followed and recognised the pilot as soon as his headgear had been removed. He was taken to No. 21 Casualty clearing station and diagnosed with a fractured skull. He did not regain consciousness and died at 20:00.|$|E
50|$|He {{is remembered}} as being {{thoroughly}} courageous without being reckless, and {{was successful in}} his amazing feats because he was practically faultless as a pilot, and {{knew exactly what he}} and <b>his</b> <b>machines</b> could do.|$|R
50|$|After {{successful}} {{use in the}} 1910 census, Mr. Powers {{formed a}} corporation to manufacture <b>his</b> <b>machines</b> and sell them commercially. The company was founded in 1911 in Newark, New Jersey. In 1914, he moved to Brooklyn, New York.|$|R
50|$|The initial machine only {{sold for}} $6,000, but later re{{invention}}s would boost <b>his</b> <b>machine's</b> worth to around $200,000. Another invention that Hammerstein created {{was a more}} efficient plumbing system for his sink when it had leaked one night.|$|R
5|$|On 23 April 1917, Ball {{was under}} strict orders to stay over British lines, but still engaged the Germans {{five times in}} his Nieuport. In his first combat that day, using his {{preferred}} belly shot, he sent an Albatros into a spin, following it down and continuing to fire at it until it struck the ground. It was No.56 Squadron's first victory. Regaining an altitude of , he tried to dive underneath an Albatros two-seater and pop up under its belly as usual, but he overshot, and the German rear gunner put a burst of 15 bullets through the Nieuport's wings and spars. Ball coaxed the Nieuport home for repairs, returning to battle in an S.E.5. In his third combat of the day, he fired five rounds before <b>his</b> <b>machine</b> gun jammed. After landing to clear the gun, he took off once more, surprising five Albatros fighters and sending one down in flames. His fifth battle, shortly thereafter, appeared inconclusive, as the enemy plane managed to land safely. However, its observer had been mortally wounded.|$|E
5|$|Then, after flying past McCudden in a head-on firing pass, Voss's Fokker was {{hit with}} bullets on the {{starboard}} side by Hoidge. Meantime, Rhys Davids had pulled aside to change an ammunition drum; he rejoined combat with a 150meter (500foot) height advantage over Voss's altitude of 450meters (1,500feet), and began a long flat dive onto the tail of Voss' triplane. At point-blank range, he holed the German aircraft end to end with <b>his</b> <b>machine</b> guns before turning. It wandered into his line of flight again, in a gentle westward glide; Rhys Davids again ripped the German plane as its engine quit. The aircraft missed a mid-air collision by inches. The British ace fired again. As the triplane's glide steepened, Rhys Davids overran him at about 300meters (1,000feet) altitude and lost sight of his opponent. From above, Bowman saw the Fokker in {{what could have been}} a landing glide, right up until it stalled. It then flipped inverted and nose down, dropping directly to earth. The resulting smash left only the rudder intact.|$|E
5|$|Voss, an avid motorcyclist, had {{a love of}} {{machinery}} {{that led him to}} consort with his enlisted mechanics, Karl Timms and Christian Rueser; he was even on a first name basis with them. In time, they would transfer squadrons to accompany him. Voss contravened uniform regulations at times and could often be found in the hangar working on <b>his</b> <b>machine</b> beside the mechanics, dressed in a grubby jacket without insignia. His care extended to his craft's exterior; he adorned his Albatros D.III with both a swastika and a heart for good luck. And although he was a casual dresser around his home airfield, when flying he would be well-dressed with a silk shirt beneath his aviation gear. He joked {{that he wanted to be}} presentable to the girls of Paris if he were captured; however, the shirt's silk collar protected his neck from chafing while he swivelled his head about watching for other aircraft during flight.|$|E
5000|$|Alexandre Dang {{started his}} artistic work in 2004. He has been {{influenced}} by artists like Alexander Calder with his mobiles and stabiles and Jean Tinguely with <b>his</b> <b>machines.</b> He creates especially in situ installations with [...] "Dancing Solar Flowers".|$|R
40|$|The {{engineer}} Konrad Zuse (1910 - 1995) devotes {{himself to}} the design and construction of a binary, programmable machine, the Z 1. While building <b>his</b> <b>machines,</b> he also started to devise a conceptual and notational system for writing 'programs' to execute applications much {{more complex than the}} basic arithmetic calculations. He delved deep into the study of formal logic in order to work out his "computation plan", the Plankalkül. The aim of the present study is to highlight the general purpose and technical specifics of this language, its historical and scientific background, and the philosophical inspiration leading Konrad Zuse to employ the predicate logic in the formalization of the " computation projects " for <b>his</b> <b>machines...</b>|$|R
25|$|On 4 October, he {{was called}} away from {{rebuilding}} <b>his</b> <b>machine's</b> engine to report to Army High Command Headquarters. There {{he was awarded the}} Iron Cross First Class. For both classes of the Iron Cross, Berthold received his award second only to Bülow.|$|R
