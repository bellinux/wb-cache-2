5|$|Taiko {{performance}} is generally taught orally and through demonstration. Historically, general patterns for taiko were written down, {{such as in}} the 1512 encyclopedia called the Taigensho, but written scores for taiko pieces are generally unavailable. One reason for the adherence to an oral tradition is that, from group to group, the rhythmic patterns in a given piece are often performed differently. Furthermore, <b>ethnomusicologist</b> WilliamP. Malm observed that Japanese players within a group could not usefully predict one another using written notation, and instead did so through listening. In Japan, printed parts are not used during lessons.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the band}} members grew up together: Dama, Dadah and Bekoto were playmates and {{attended}} the same primary school; during their secondary school studies, Dadah's older brother Nono likewise became {{a close friend of}} Raoul, the older brother of Dama. The high school offered a music program in which Dadah, Nono, Charle, Bekoto and Fafa participated together, with Fafa as a vocalist and Bekoto as a pianist. Beginning in 1970, Raoul became enamored with the acoustic guitar. He met frequently with Dadah and Nono to play together using guitars he constructed from wood and bicycle brake cables available at a workshop attached to a center for the deaf and blind where his father worked; the trio began performing at school parties and events. As teens, the trio often listened to a radio show hosted by popular Malagasy journalist and <b>ethnomusicologist</b> Latimer Rangers, who recorded, broadcast and promoted contemporary and traditional music from villages across Madagascar. Rangers also broadcast foreign artists who were relatively unknown to the Malagasy public, such as Bob Dylan, described the meaning and history of the protest song and other foreign genres, and drew connections between Malagasy musical styles and American Blues music, South African music and other genres.|$|E
50|$|As {{technology}} advanced, researchers {{graduated from}} depending on wax cylinders and the phonograph to digital recordings and video cameras, allowing recordings {{to become more}} accurate representations of music studied. These technological advances have helped <b>ethnomusicologists</b> be more mobile in the field, but have also let some <b>ethnomusicologists</b> shift back to the “armchair analysis” of Stumpf and Hornbostel. Since video recordings are now considered cultural texts, <b>ethnomusicologists</b> can conduct fieldwork by recording music performances and creating documentaries of the people behind the music, which can be accurately studied outside of the field. Additionally, {{the invention of the}} internet and forms of online communication could allow <b>ethnomusicologists</b> to develop new methods of fieldwork within a virtual community.|$|R
50|$|Slobin {{also points}} out an {{interesting}} facet of ethical thinking among <b>ethnomusicologists</b> in {{that many of the}} ethical rules deal with Westerners studying in non-Western, third world countries.

50|$|Musical {{interaction}} through globalization {{played a}} huge role in ethnomusicology in the 1990s. Musical change was increasingly discussed. <b>Ethnomusicologists</b> began {{looking into a}} 'global village', straying away from a specialized look at music within a specific culture. There are two sides to this globalization of music: on one hand it would bring more cultural exchange globally, {{but on the other}} hand it could facilitate the appropriation and assimilation of musics. <b>Ethnomusicologists</b> have approached this new combination of different styles of music within one music by looking at the musical complexity and the degree of compatibility. This Westernization and modernization of music created a new focus of study; <b>ethnomusicologists</b> began to look at how different musics interact in the 1990s.|$|R

While admiring the song's transcendent qualities, Everett quotes the <b>ethnomusicologist</b> David Reck, who wrote in 1988: [...] "Most memorable is the sheer simplicity and straightforwardness of the haunting modal melody, somehow capturing perfectly the mood and truth and aphoristic essence of the lyrics." ...|$|E

50|$|However, even {{as early}} as the 1960s some <b>ethnomusicologists</b> were proposing that ethnomusicological methods should also be used to examine western music. For instance, Alan Merriam, in a 1960 article, defines ethnomusicology not as the study of non-European music, but as the study of music in culture. In doing so he {{discards}} some of the 'external' focus proposed by the earlier (and contemporary) <b>ethnomusicologists,</b> who regarded non-European music as more relevant to the attention of scholars. Moreover, he expands the definition from being centered on music to including the study of culture as well.|$|R

500|$|By 1965's Rubber Soul, Harrison {{had begun}} to lead the other Beatles into folk rock through his {{interest}} in the Byrds and Bob Dylan, and towards Indian classical music through his use of the sitar on [...] "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)". He later called Rubber Soul his [...] "favourite [...] album". Revolver (1966) included three of his compositions: [...] "Taxman", [...] "Love You To" [...] and [...] "I Want to Tell You". His introduction of the drone-like tambura part on Lennon's [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] exemplified the band's ongoing exploration of non-Western instruments. The tabla-driven [...] "Love You To" [...] was the Beatles' first genuine foray into Indian music. According to the <b>ethnomusicologist</b> David Reck, the song set a precedent in popular music as an example of Asian culture being represented by Westerners respectfully and without parody. Harrison continued to develop his interest in non-Western instrumentation, playing swarmandal on [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever".|$|E
500|$|Following {{a series}} of concerts in Northern Italy in spring 1913, Busoni was offered the {{directorship}} of the Liceo Rossini in Bologna. He had recently moved to an apartment in Viktoria-Luise-Platz in Schöneberg, Berlin, but took up the offer, intending to spend his summers in Berlin. The posting proved {{not to be a}} success. Bologna was a cultural backwater, despite occasional visits from celebrities such as Isadora Duncan. Busoni's piano pupils were untalented, and he had constant arguments with the local authorities. After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, he asked for a year of absence to play an American tour; in fact he was never to return. Virtually his sole permanent achievement at the school was to have modernized its sanitary facilities. He had however during this time composed another concertante work for piano and orchestra, the Indian Fantasy. The piece is based on [...] melodies and rhythms from various American Indian tribes; Busoni derived them from a book he had received from [...] his former pupil, the <b>ethnomusicologist</b> Natalie Curtis Burlin during his 1910 tour of the USA. The work was premiered with Busoni as soloist in March 1914 in Berlin.|$|E
500|$|According to Religion News Service writer Steve Rabey, [...] "Within You Without You" [...] "contrast Western individualism with Eastern monism". The lyrics convey basic {{tenets of}} Vedanta philosophy, {{particularly}} in Harrison's {{reference to the}} concept of maya (the illusory nature of existence), in the lines [...] "And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion / Never glimpse the truth". Author Joshua Greene paraphrases the song-wide message as: [...] "A wall of illusion separates us from each other … which only turns our love for one another cold. Peace will come when we learn to see past the illusion of differences and come to know that we are one …" [...] The solution espoused by Harrison is for individuals to see beyond the self and each seek change within, further to Vivekananda's contention in Raja Yoga that [...] "Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest that divinity …" [...] According to <b>ethnomusicologist</b> David Reck, aside from the reference to maya, the lyrics convey Indian philosophical concepts such as advait (the one essential reality), satya (perception of truth) and, in the line [...] "With our love we could save the world", universal love.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethnomusicologists</b> {{also tend}} towards the {{discussion}} of ethics in sociological contexts. Timothy Taylor writes on the byproducts of cultural appropriation through music, arguing that the 20th century commodification of non-western musics serves to marginalize certain groups of musicians who are not traditionally integrated into the western music production and distribution industries. Steven Feld argues that <b>Ethnomusicologists</b> also have their place in analyzing the ethics of popular music collaboration, such as Paul Simon's work with traditional zydeco, Chicano, and South African beats on Graceland. Feld notes that inherently imbalanced power dynamics within musical collaboration can contribute to cultural exploitation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ethnomusicologists</b> {{continued}} {{to deal with}} and consider the effects of globalization on their work. Bruno Nettl identifies Westernization and modernization as two concurrent and similar cultural trends that served to help streamline musical expression all over the world. While creeping globalization had an undeniable effect on cultural homogeneity, it also helped broaden musical horizons all over the world. Rather than simply lamenting the continuing assimilation of folk music of non-western cultures, many <b>ethnomusicologists</b> chose to examine exactly how non-western cultures dealt {{with the process of}} incorporating western music into their own practices to facilitate the survival of their previous traditions.|$|R
