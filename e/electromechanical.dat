5|$|Ferranti Technologies is an electronic, <b>electromechanical</b> and {{electrical}} engineering {{company based in}} Waterhead.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they are}} {{sometimes}} included {{in the category of}} electronic organs, the majority of Hammond organs are, strictly speaking, electric or <b>electromechanical</b> rather than electronic organs, because the sound is produced by moving parts rather than electronic oscillators.|$|E
5|$|Among the tetrahedrally bonded semiconductors, it {{has been}} stated that ZnO has the highest {{piezoelectric}} tensor, {{or at least one}} comparable to that of GaN and AlN. This property makes it a technologically important material for many piezoelectrical applications, which require a large <b>electromechanical</b> coupling.|$|E
5|$|By 2005, Clavia {{had found}} {{commercial}} {{success with the}} Nord Lead synthesizer, which emulated analog synthesis, and the Nord Electro virtual <b>electromechanical</b> keyboard, which emulated the Hammond Organ and Rhodes and Wurlitzer electric pianos. The goal of the Nord Stage was to combine these two technologies together into a flagship instrument.|$|E
5|$|Five months later, Harry is {{coping with}} the aftereffects of his {{transformation}} while incarcerated at Ravencroft. His associate, Gustav Fiers, visits Harry and the pair discuss forming their own team. Harry orders Fiers to start with Sytsevich. Later, an unknown team of men break Sytsevich out of prison. Equipped with an <b>electromechanical</b> suit of armor, Sytsevich calls himself the Rhino and rampages through the streets. Peter, inspired by Gwen's graduation speech, resumes his role as Spider-Man, and confronts him.|$|E
5|$|There were three, {{relatively}} independent, research {{areas in}} the 1960s and 1970s {{that lead to the}} field of augmentative and alternative communication. First was the work on early <b>electromechanical</b> communication and writing systems. The second was the development of communication and language boards, and lastly there was the research on ordinary (without disability) child language development.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Turing {{worked for}} the Government Code and Cypher School (GC) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that {{produced}} Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the section which was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an <b>electromechanical</b> machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing {{played a pivotal role}} in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic, and in so doing helped win the war.|$|E
5|$|Induction generators, {{which were}} {{often used for}} wind power {{projects}} in the 1980s and 1990s, require reactive power for excitation so substations used in wind-power collection systems include substantial capacitor banks for power factor correction. Different types of wind turbine generators behave differently during transmission grid disturbances, so extensive modelling of the dynamic <b>electromechanical</b> characteristics of a new wind farm is required by transmission system operators to ensure predictable stable behaviour during system faults. In particular, induction generators cannot support the system voltage during faults, unlike steam or hydro turbine-driven synchronous generators.|$|E
5|$|Konrad Zuse's Z3 was the world's first working programmable, fully {{automatic}} computer, with binary digital arithmetic logic, but it lacked the conditional branching of a Turing machine. On 12 May 1941, it was successfully presented {{to an audience}} of scientists of the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt ("German Laboratory for Aviation") in Berlin. The Z3 stored its program on an external tape, but it was <b>electromechanical</b> rather than electronic. The Colossus of 1943 was the first electronic computing device, {{but it was not a}} general-purpose machine.|$|E
5|$|Like its sibling V-Bombers, the Victor {{made use}} of the Navigational and Bombing System (NBS); a little-used optical sight had also been {{installed}} upon early aircraft. For navigation and bomb-aiming purposes, the Victor employed numerous radar systems. These included the H2S radar, the first airborne ground-scanning radar, and the Green Satin radar. Radar information was inputted into the onboard <b>electromechanical</b> analogue bomb-aiming apparatus. Some of the navigation and targeting equipment was either directly descended from, or shared concepts with, those used on Handley Page's preceding Halifax bomber. Operationally, {{the accuracy of the}} bomb-aiming system proved to be limited to roughly 400 yards, which was deemed sufficient for high-level nuclear strike operations.|$|E
5|$|The Nord Stage {{follows the}} success of earlier {{keyboard}} instruments from Clavia, and contains similar emulations of vintage <b>electromechanical</b> keyboards such as the Hammond Organ and electric pianos as found on the Nord Electro 2, with additional functionality including a weighted piano-like keyboard on certain models, a synthesizer section based on the Nord Lead, a more versatile organ section and extended effects processing. The Nord Stage is multitimbral, which means it can play more than one sound at once, either by splitting the internal keyboard or connecting an external MIDI controller.|$|E
5|$|The Rhodes Mk III EK-10 was a {{combination}} electric piano and synthesizer instrument, introduced in 1980 before CBS bought ARP Instruments in 1981. It used analog oscillators and filters alongside the existing <b>electromechanical</b> elements. The overall effect {{was that of a}} Rhodes piano and a synthesizer being played simultaneously. The instrument was unreliable with a problematic production, particularly when a shipment of 150 units to Japan caused interference with local television reception. Compared to the new polyphonic synthesizers being marketed at the same time, it was limited in scope and sound, and very few units were sold.|$|E
5|$|Fermi {{argued that}} {{by using the}} delayed neutrons, and by {{carefully}} controlling the reaction rates as the power is ramped up, a pile can reach criticality at fission rates slightly below that of a chain reaction relying solely on the prompt neutrons from the fission reactions. Since the rate of release of these neutrons depends on fission events taking place some time earlier, there is a delay between any power spikes and the later criticality event. This time gives the operators leeway; if a spike in the prompt neutron flux is seen, they have several minutes before this causes a runaway reaction. If a neutron absorber, or neutron poison, is injected {{at any time during}} this period, the reactor will shut down. Consequently, the reaction can be controlled with <b>electromechanical</b> control systems such as control rods. Compton felt this delay was enough to provide a critical margin of safety, and allowed Fermi to build Chicago Pile-1 at Stagg Field.|$|E
5|$|Mariko {{is brought}} before Shingen at Ichirō's estate when ninjas led by Harada attack and whisk her away. Logan and Yukio arrive later and, using Ichirō's X-ray machine, {{discover}} a robotic parasite attached to Logan's heart, suppressing his healing ability. Logan cuts himself open and extracts the device. During the operation, Shingen attacks but Yukio holds Shingen off {{long enough for}} Logan to recover and kill Shingen. Logan follows Mariko's trail {{to the village of}} Ichirō's birth, where he is captured by Harada's ninjas. Logan is placed in a machine by Dr. Green, who reveals her plans to extract his healing factor and introduces him to the Silver Samurai, an <b>electromechanical</b> suit of Japanese armour with energized swords made of adamantium. Mariko escapes from Harada, who believes he is acting in Mariko's interests, and frees Logan from the machine. Harada sees the error of his ways and is killed by the Silver Samurai while helping Logan escape.|$|E
5|$|The scheme {{presented}} in the table {{is known as the}} impedance analogy. Circuit diagrams produced using this analogy match the electrical impedance of the mechanical system seen by the electrical circuit, making it intuitive from an electrical engineering standpoint. There is also the mobility analogy, in which force corresponds to current and velocity corresponds to voltage. This has equally valid results but requires using the reciprocals of the electrical counterparts listed above. Hence, M → C, S → 1/L, D → G where G is electrical conductance, the inverse of resistance. Equivalent circuits produced by this scheme are similar, but are the dual impedance forms whereby series elements become parallel, capacitors become inductors, and so on. Circuit diagrams using the mobility analogy more closely match the mechanical arrangement of the circuit, making it more intuitive from a mechanical engineering standpoint. In addition to their application to <b>electromechanical</b> systems, these analogies are widely used to aid analysis in acoustics.|$|E
5|$|The Mk 8 Rangekeeper was an <b>electromechanical</b> analog {{computer}} whose function was to continuously calculate the gun's bearing and elevation, Line-Of-Fire (LOF), {{to hit a}} future position of the target. It did this by automatically receiving information from the director (LOS), the FC Radar (range), the ship's gyrocompass (true ship's course), the ship's Pitometer log (ship's speed), the Stable Vertical (ship's roll and pitch), and the ship's anemometer (relative wind speed and direction). Also, before the surface action started, the FTs made manual inputs for the average initial velocity of the projectiles fired out of the battery's gun barrels, and air density. With all this information, the Rangekeeper calculated the relative motion between the ship and the target. It then could calculate an offset angle and change of range between the target's present position (LOS) and future position {{at the end of}} the projectile's time of flight. To this bearing and range offset, it added corrections for gravity, wind, Magnus effect of the spinning projectile, earth's curvature, and coriolis effect. The result was the turret's bearing and elevation orders (LOF). During the surface action, range and deflection Spots and target altitude (not zero during Gun Fire Support) were manually entered.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} type of {{electricity}} meter is the <b>electromechanical</b> induction watt-hour meter.|$|E
25|$|With Edward George Boulenger of the London Zoo, {{he built}} a timer-operated <b>electromechanical</b> rat trap.|$|E
25|$|On March 30, 2007, Berkshire Hathaway {{announced}} TTI, Inc. {{to be part}} of the Berkshire Hathaway Group. Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, TTI, Inc. is {{the largest}} distributor specialist of passive, interconnect and <b>electromechanical</b> components. TTI’s extensive product line includes: resistors, capacitors, connectors, potentiometers, trimmers, magnetic and circuit protection components, wire and cable, identification products, application tools and <b>electromechanical</b> devices.|$|E
25|$|<b>Electromechanical</b> {{switching}} systems required sources of electricity {{in form of}} direct current (DC), as well as alternating ring current (AC), which were generated on-site with mechanical generators. In addition, telephone switches required adjustment of many mechanical parts. Unlike modern switches, a circuit connecting a dialed call through an <b>electromechanical</b> switch had DC continuity within the local exchange area via metallic conductors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Electromechanical</b> {{protective}} relays operate by either magnetic attraction, or magnetic induction. Unlike switching type <b>electromechanical</b> relays with fixed and usually ill-defined operating voltage thresholds and operating times, {{protective relays}} have well-established, selectable, and adjustable time and current (or other operating parameter) operating characteristics. Protection relays may use arrays of induction disks, shaded-pole, magnets, operating and restraint coils, solenoid-type operators, telephone-relay contacts, and phase-shifting networks.|$|E
25|$|More modern designs now use {{solid state}} {{technology}} (transistors) {{to perform the}} same function that the relays perform in <b>electromechanical</b> regulators.|$|E
25|$|Electronic {{music is}} music that employs {{electronic}} musical instruments, digital instruments and circuitry-based music technology. An electronic musician is a musician who composes or performs such music. In general, a distinction {{can be made}} between sound produced using <b>electromechanical</b> means, such as violins and drums, and that produced using electronic technology. <b>Electromechanical</b> instruments include mechanical elements, such as strings, hammers, and so on, and electric elements, such as magnetic pickups, power amplifiers and loudspeakers. Examples of <b>electromechanical</b> sound producing devices include the telharmonium, Hammond organ, and the electric guitar, which are typically made loud enough for performers and audiences to hear with an instrument amplifier and speaker cabinet. Pure electronic instruments do not have vibrating strings, hammers, or other sound-producing mechanisms. Devices such as the theremin, sound synthesizer, and computer can produce electronic sounds.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Union began {{offering}} 30-line <b>electromechanical</b> test broadcasts in Moscow on October 31, 1931, and a commercially manufactured television set in 1932.|$|E
25|$|For an {{electrically}} resonant system, the Q factor {{represents the}} effect of electrical resistance and, for <b>electromechanical</b> resonators such as quartz crystals, mechanical friction.|$|E
25|$|A {{microprocessor-based}} digital {{protection relay}} can replace {{the functions of}} many discrete <b>electromechanical</b> instruments. These relays convert voltage and currents to digital form and process the resulting measurements using a microprocessor. The digital relay can emulate functions of many discrete <b>electromechanical</b> relays in one device, simplifying protection design and maintenance. Each digital relay can run self-test routines to confirm its readiness and alarm if a fault is detected. Digital relays can also provide functions such as communications (SCADA) interface, monitoring of contact inputs, metering, waveform analysis, and other useful features. Digital relays can, for example, store multiple sets of protection parameters, which allows {{the behavior of the}} relay to be changed during maintenance of attached equipment. Digital relays also can provide protection strategies impossible to implement with <b>electromechanical</b> relays. This is particularly so in long distance high voltage or multi-terminal circuits or in lines that are series or shunt compensated They also offer benefits in self-testing and communication to supervisory control systems.|$|E
25|$|Early exchanges were <b>electromechanical</b> systems using motors, shaft drives, {{rotating}} {{switches and}} relays. Some types of automatic exchanges were the Strowger switch or step-by-step switch, All Relay, X-Y, panel switch and the crossbar switch.|$|E
25|$|A {{characteristic}} of <b>electromechanical</b> switching equipment {{is that the}} maintenance staff could hear the mechanical clattering of Strowgers, panel switches or crossbar relays. Most Bell System central offices were housed in reinforced concrete buildings with concrete ceilings and floors.|$|E
25|$|The only fully <b>electromechanical</b> Selectric Typewriter with fully {{proportional}} spacing and which used a Selectric type element was the expensive Selectric Composer, which {{was capable of}} right-margin justification and was considered a typesetting machine rather than a typewriter.|$|E
25|$|MEMS {{resonators}} {{are small}} <b>electromechanical</b> structures that vibrate at high frequencies. They {{are used for}} timing references, signal filtering, mass sensing, biological sensing, motion sensing, and other diverse applications. This article concerns their application in frequency and timing references.|$|E
25|$|The TDC {{performed}} the trigonometric calculations required to compute a target intercept {{course for the}} torpedo. It also had an <b>electromechanical</b> interface to the torpedoes, allowing it to automatically set courses while torpedoes were still in their tubes, ready to be fired.|$|E
25|$|All {{solenoids}} and coils used on microprocessor games {{include a}} special reverse-biased diode {{to eliminate a}} high-voltage pulse of reverse EMF (electromotive force). Without this diode, when the solenoid is de-energized, the magnetic field that was built up in the coil collapses and generates a brief, high-voltage pulse backward into the wiring, capable of destroying the solid-state components used to control the solenoid. Proper wiring polarity must be retained during coil replacement or this diode will act as a dead short, immediately destroying electronic switches. Older <b>electromechanical</b> AC game solenoids do not require this diode, since they were controlled with mechanical switches. However, <b>electromechanical</b> games running on DC do require diodes to protect the rectifier.|$|E
25|$|Circuits {{interconnecting}} switches {{are called}} trunks. Before Signalling System 7, Bell System <b>electromechanical</b> switches in the United States communicated {{with one another}} over trunks {{using a variety of}} DC voltages and signaling tones. It would be rare to see any of these in use today.|$|E
25|$|Mechatronics is an {{engineering}} discipline {{which deals with}} the convergence of electrical and mechanical systems. Such combined systems are known as <b>electromechanical</b> systems and have widespread adoption. Examples include automated manufacturing systems, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, and various subsystems of aircraft and automobiles.|$|E
25|$|Electronic {{switching}} systems gradually evolved in stages from <b>electromechanical</b> hybrids with {{stored program control}} to the fully digital systems. Early systems used reed relay-switched metallic paths under digital control. Equipment testing, phone numbers reassignments, circuit lockouts and similar tasks were accomplished by data entry on a terminal.|$|E
