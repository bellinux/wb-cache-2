The review Marge reads of Talk to the Hand [...] "The writing snaps, crackles and pops" [...] was how Variety reviewed the sitcom Just Shoot Me! when it first aired in 1997. The musical argument between kids, adults and seniors is a parody of the song [...] "Kids" [...] from the musical Bye Bye Birdie.

500|$|In {{an early}} {{interview}} with Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker, Watchmen artist Dave Gibbons {{said that he}} thought the time had passed to make a Watchmen movie. Gibbons felt that the window to make a Watchmen movie was during {{the success of the}} 1989 Batman film. When that time passed, Gibbons also told Neon magazine that he was [...] " [...] glad because it wouldn't have been up to the book". Gibbons felt it would probably be better adapted as a television series like The Prisoner. When given the opportunity, Gibbons enjoyed the script by Alex Tse. Gibbons gave Snyder some script advice, which the director accepted. He drew licensing art for the film, consulted on merchandise and the webcomics, publicized the film with Snyder, and wrote a tie-in book about the creation of the comic, entitled Watching the Watchmen. Moore did not mind Gibbons' involvement and felt it did not have any impact on their friendship. Snyder asked Gibbons to draw up a storyboard for the film's altered ending, which the comics' colorist John Higgins also returned to work on. Gibbons believed watching the film on DVD would emulate <b>flipping</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> book, with viewers pausing or rewinding the film to catch details.|$|E
2500|$|While at Rochester, Ashkin was {{the first}} {{scientist}} to formally {{recognize the importance of}} the Feynman diagram. Feynman devised the diagram in 1948 to provide a simple visualization of the mathematical expressions governing the behavior of subatomic particles. Although the diagram and its offshoots were later seen as extremely important tools, Feynman did not give them a theoretical framework nor did he explain how he proposed they be used. Physicists had difficulty in understanding their function, distrusted their simplicity, and were reluctant to give them formal recognition. Feynman later said physicists did not realize the diagram's power and would employ a more complex method created by Julian Schwinger. Ashkin, he said, {{was the first}} to break with this pattern: [...] "They somehow or other couldn’t do it. They had to go through this [...] to believe it. But that's all right. The only person who didn't, the first paper where it was used directly — which I kept looking for, I kept <b>flipping</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Physical Review as it came out — was Ashkin. He'd done some calculation for some experiment, and he said, 'We’ve calculated this using Feynman's rules.' Bloop! There it was in writing! Then gradually more and more people did it." ...|$|E

Manson spent the remainder of his stay in New York at the clubbers' hotel room, where he stumbled on public-access television cable television channels, which were [...] "a completely new phenomenon" [...] to him. Manson [...] "spent hours <b>flipping</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> station, watching Pat Robertson preach about society's evils and then ask people to call him with their credit card number," [...] while [...] "on the other channel, a guy was greasing up his cock with Vaseline and asking people to call and give him their credit card number." [...] This inspired Manson to grab the hotel notepad and begin penning the song's lyrics. Manson explains in his autobiography The Long Hard Road Out of Hell that [...] "I had written other songs I thought were good, but [...] "Cake and Sodomy" [...] {{was more than just a}} good song.
