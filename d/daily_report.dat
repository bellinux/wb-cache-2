5|$|The Malovan-based {{battalion}} set up {{its first}} roadblock on 26 March, and the Kupres Battalion established its own checkpoints in response the following day. On 27 March, {{an attempt to}} reach a negotiated settlement failed and the commanding officer of the 19th Partisan Brigade announced that armed combat might start at a moment's notice. The news prompted the evacuation of civilians of all ethnicities on 27–28 March. According to the <b>daily</b> <b>report</b> of the 30th Partisan Division of 29 March, the Kupres Plateau was deserted except for able bodied and armed men. The same report noted that the JNA could not deploy to Kupres itself without a fight. The JNA {{was convinced that the}} HV had intervened at Kupres to threaten the Bosnian Serbs. Kupres had a high strategic value, because it sat astride a road linking the towns of Bugojno and Tomislavgrad from the central Bosnia region to western Herzegovina and further on to Croatia.|$|E

25|$|Sheldon {{wrote that}} the <b>daily</b> <b>report</b> of the 4th Army claimed that the Allied attack had been a costly failure, which was hyperbole. The attackers had {{advanced}} , two defensive positions had been overrun and heavy artillery had severely bombarded German Eingreifdivisionen moving behind the front line. On the Gheluvelt Plateau, the German defence was most successful and despite {{the loss of the}} observation posts on Bellewaarde Ridge, the Eingreifdivisionen of Gruppe Wytschaete had not been needed. The Germans had proved capable of powerful and determined counter-attacks and the success of the defence of the plateau compromised a further British advance in the north, by leaving it vulnerable to enfilade fire by small arms and observed artillery-fire. A British advance across the Gheluvelt Plateau {{would have to be a}} slow process of preparatory bombardments and limited advances. British and French commanders considered the attack to be the first of a series of blows which would lead to an inevitable German collapse and German commanders were concerned at the demands that the battle made on their troops.|$|E
500|$|An {{article in}} the local press {{describing}} Zappa as [...] "the Movie King of Cucamonga" [...] prompted the local police to suspect that he was making pornographic films. In March 1965, Zappa was approached by a vice squad undercover officer, and accepted an offer of $100 to produce a suggestive audio tape for an alleged stag party. Zappa and a female friend recorded a faked erotic episode. When Zappa was about {{to hand over the}} tape, he was arrested, and the police stripped the studio of all recorded material. The press was tipped off beforehand, and next day's The <b>Daily</b> <b>Report</b> wrote that [...] "Vice Squad investigators stilled the tape recorders of a free-swinging, a-go-go film and recording studio here Friday and arrested a self-styled movie producer". Zappa was charged with [...] "conspiracy to commit pornography". This felony charge was reduced and he was sentenced to six months in jail on a misdemeanor, with all but ten days suspended. His brief imprisonment left a permanent mark, and was central to the formation of his anti-authoritarian stance. Zappa lost several recordings made at Studio Z in the process, as the police only returned 30 out of 80 hours of tape seized. Eventually, he could no longer afford to pay the rent on the studio and was evicted. Zappa managed to recover some of his possessions before the studio was torn down in 1966.|$|E

2500|$|The former {{community}} of Grapeland, first settled in 1869, lay roughly between today's Victoria Groves Park and Central Park. There was a schoolhouse which also doubled as a church.

Scofield as {{the focal point of}} a network of irrigation pipes. [...] The system was unused, however, because the bond issue was declared illegal. [...] "Orchards and vineyards began to die," [...] The <b>Daily</b> <b>Report</b> newspaper reported in a retrospective. [...] "Residents moved out. The post office closed in 1905. Homes, buildings were destroyed or abandoned." [...] The reservoir remained unused until 1956, when the Fontana Union Water Company filled it with 5million gallons of water. The local school district was merged with the Etiwanda district in 1901. In 1957 the settlement was practically deserted, but there were still rabbit-proof stone walls marking boundaries of previous citrus orchards.|$|E

2500|$|In 1892, as {{a member}} of the Pacific Coast Women's Press Association, Keith, who wrote for the San Francisco News Letter over the pen name of “Di Vernon,” and was noted as having scored a [...] "journalistic triumph" [...] for her {{comments}} published by the Illustrated American. Beginning with a Fourth of July article, 1890, she published a glowing article in the News Letter, in which she stated: “It is treason to haul down the flag from the masthead; it is treason to degrade it in the estimation of a child.” In February, 1891, she asked: “Shall the flag of our country be debased by bearing upon its fair surface an advertising device? If there be no law to prevent it, let us have one at once.” In September, 1891, she delivered an address before the Pacific Coast Women's Press Association at Union Square Hall. The peroration was a patriotic outburst, calling upon Congress to protect the flag from the advertising 'fiend'. This was published in the <b>Daily</b> <b>Report,</b> of San Francisco, and in the New York Journalist, giving it a widespread circulation. This address also contained an exposition of “Di Vernon's” pet project, the organization of the “Order of the American Flag,” a patriotic legion, among the children of America. At other times during the last few years which preceded this, Keith (as Di Vernon) made similar appeals to arouse the patriotic sentiment. So she was surprised, after picking up a copy of the Illustrated American in April, 1892, to find a self-laudatory editorial, in which the paper congratulated itself that the crusade which it had inaugurated against the flag-advertising was about yield results. To claim the whole credit for that aroused Di Vernon's sense of justice. She wrote to the editor, asking the date of the “inauguration.” Maurice Meyer Minton, Sr. replied in a courteous note, stating that the matter was brought up in editorials of vol. 9, page 530, dated Feb. 6, 1892. Keith (Di Vernon) found all the dates of her patriotic articles, and in the News Letter of May 14, 1892, published a history of the whole matter, under the [...] caption: “Honor the Flag.” With characteristic directness, Di Vernon asked: “Don't you think that instead of taking the lead, you were rather late in dropping into line?” ...|$|E

60|$|From the 2d to the 7th of December, {{the steward}} waited punctually on the platform, saw the trains come in, and {{satisfied}} himself, evening after evening, that the travelers were all strangers to him.

By a coincidence so extraordinary that his enemies might have suspected it of not being a coincidence at all, the morning on which Miss Gwilt lost her patience proved to be also the morning on which the doctor lost his confidence for the first time.|$|E

Her house was always quiet; to-night, however, it seemed unusually so. At supper her women served her with a silent assiduity; it spoke what their sealed lips could not utter--the sympathy of Mormon women. Jerd came to her with the key of the great door of the stone stable, and to make his <b>daily</b> <b>report</b> about the horses. One of his daily duties was to give Black Star and Night and the other racers a ten-mile run. This day it had been omitted, and the boy grew confused in explanations that she had not asked for. She did inquire if he would return on the morrow, and Jerd, in mingled surprise and relief, assured her he would always work for her. Jane missed the rattle and trot, canter and gallop of the incoming riders on the hard trails. Dusk shaded the grove where she walked; the birds ceased singing; the wind sighed through the leaves of the cottonwoods, and the running water murmured down its stone-bedded channel. The glimmering of the first star was like the peace and beauty of the night. Her faith welled up in her heart and said that all would soon be right in her little world. She pictured Venters about his lonely camp-fire sitting between his faithful dogs. She prayed for his safety, for the success of his undertaking.|$|E

6000|$|The {{subject of}} thunderbolts {{is a very}} {{fascinating}} one, and {{all the more so}} because there are no such things in existence at all as thunderbolts of any sort. Like the snakes of Iceland, their whole history might, from the positive point of view at least, be summed up in the simple statement of their utter nonentity. But does that do away in the least, I should like to know, with their intrinsic interest and importance? Not a bit of it. It only adds to the mystery and charm of the whole subject. Does anyone feel as keenly interested in any real living cobra or anaconda as in the non-existent great sea-serpent? Are ghosts and vampires less attractive objects of popular study than cats and donkeys? Can the present King of Abyssinia, interviewed by our own correspondent, equal the romantic charm of Prester John, or the butcher in the next street rival the personality of Sir Roger Charles Doughty Tichborne, Baronet? No, the real fact is this: if there were thunderbolts, the question of their nature and action would be a wholly dull, scientific, and priggish one; it is their unreality alone that invests them with all the mysterious weirdness of pure fiction. Lightning, now, is a common thing that one reads about wearily in the books on electricity, a mere ordinary matter of positive and negative, density and potential, to be measured in ohms (whatever they may be), and partially imitated with Leyden jars and red sealing-wax apparatus. Why, did not Benjamin Franklin, a fat old gentleman in ill-fitting small clothes, bring it down from the clouds with a simple door-key, somewhere near Philadelphia? and does not Mr. Robert Scott (of the Meteorological Office) calmly predict its probable occurrence within the next twenty-four hours in his <b>daily</b> <b>report,</b> as published regularly in the morning papers? This is lightning, mere vulgar lightning, a simple result of electrical conditions in the upper atmosphere, inconveniently connected with algebraical formulas in x, y, z, with horrid symbols interspersed in Greek letters. But the real thunderbolts of Jove, the weapons that the angry Zeus, or Thor, or Indra hurls down upon the head of the trembling malefactor--how infinitely grander, more fearsome, and more mysterious! ...|$|E
