5|$|Sega {{was one of}} {{the primary}} {{competitors}} to Nintendo in the video game console industry. A few of Sega's early consoles outsold their competitors in specific markets, such as the Master System in Europe. Several of the company's later consoles were commercial failures, however, and the financial losses incurred from the Dreamcast console caused the company to restructure itself in 2001. As a result, Sega ceased to manufacture consoles and became a third-party video game developer. The only console that Sega has produced since is the <b>educational</b> <b>toy</b> console Advanced Pico Beena in 2005. Third-party variants of Sega consoles have been produced by licensed manufacturers, even after production of the original consoles had ended. Many of these variants have been produced in Brazil, where versions of the Master System and Genesis are still sold and games for them are still developed.|$|E
5|$|Struggling {{to fit in}} at Howard, {{unable to}} make tenure, and with {{concerns}} about the increasing crime rates in Washington, in 1977 the family decided to move once again, this time to Athens, Georgia. Shortly after the move Jarrell became {{an assistant professor at}} the University of Georgia. He and his wife started a high-end <b>educational</b> <b>toy</b> company that stemmed from their children's love for similar toys when living in Washington, D.C.. They opened a small shop called Tadpole Toys and Hobby Center in Athens to great reception. However, as a result of poor sales in May1982 they were forced to close it. Soon afterwards, Jarrell received tenure at the University. In 1988, he retired from his position and from teaching as a whole in order to focus on his creative work. By 1994 all three children were grown; the two daughters attended the Art Institute of Chicago, and Wadsworth Jr. became a seafarer. That year, Jae and daughter Jennifer moved to New York {{to find a place to}} live, settling in SoHo, where they were joined by Jarrell a few months later. Currently, Jarrell and Jae live and work in Cleveland, Ohio.|$|E
