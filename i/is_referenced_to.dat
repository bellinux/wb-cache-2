The supply voltage <b>is</b> <b>referenced</b> <b>to</b> the ground pin of the connector (pin 1 of an XLR), which normally {{is connected to the}} cable shield or a ground wire in the cable or both. Phantom power is usually supplied at a nominal 48 volts DC, although lower voltages are permissible and modern microphones will often operate over a wide range.|$|E
25|$|Often {{viewed as}} a {{minority}} figure in his own times and in the centuries that followed, Ibn Taymiyyah {{has become one of}} the most influential medieval writers in contemporary Islam, where his particular interpretations of the Qur'an and the Sunnah and his rejection of some aspects of classical Islamic tradition are believed to have had considerable influence on contemporary Wahhabism, Salafism, and Jihadism. Indeed, particular aspects of his teachings had a profound influence on Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the founder of the Hanbali reform movement practiced in Saudi Arabia known as Wahhabism, and on other later Wahabi scholars.

The middle summit fell victim to one of the cable car summit stations in 1930. In 1938 the west summit was blown up to create a building site for a planned flight control room for the Wehrmacht. This was never built however. Originally the height of the west summit was given as [...]|$|E
2500|$|The decibel (symbol: dB) is a {{logarithmic}} unit used {{to express}} the ratio of one value of a physical property to another, and may be {{used to express}} a change in value (e.g., +1 dB or -1 dB) or an absolute value. In the latter case, it expresses the ratio of a value to a reference value; when used in this way, the decibel symbol should be appended with a suffix that indicates the reference value or some other property. For example, if the reference value is 1 volt, then the suffix is [...] "V" [...] (i.e., [...] "20 dBV"), and if the reference value is one milliwatt, then the suffix is [...] "m" [...] (i.e., [...] "20 dBm"). [...] However, sound pressure level <b>is</b> <b>referenced</b> <b>to</b> the [...] "threshold of hearing" [...] (generally given as 20 micropascals at 1 kHz), and the suffix is [...] "SPL" [...] (i.e., [...] "60 dB SPL").|$|E
