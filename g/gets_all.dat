5|$|Players {{control the}} player {{character}} Kid Klown as {{he attempts to}} rescue Princess Honey from the villain Black Jack. The game's graphics are presented in an isometric view as Kid Klown automatically moves down a path to thwart Black Jack's plans of blowing up one of his spade bombs in each level. Various obstacles cause Kid Klown to slow down if they collide with him; if Kid Klown {{does not make it}} to the bomb in time or if he is hit too many times, the level is lost. The game consists of 5 stages. In each stage, Kid Klown must find all 4 card suit orbs and stop the bomb to complete the level. At the end of each stage Kid Klown gets a key which in turn at the ending could be of use to unlock Honey's cage. If the player <b>gets</b> <b>all</b> 4 orbs in the very first turn, Kid Klown also gets a Honey heart. After the fifth stage Kid Klown must find the correct lock out of the 10 locks to unlock Honey's cage.|$|E

25|$|One player {{begins by}} downing (playing the first tile) {{one of their}} tiles. This tile starts the line of play, in which values of {{adjacent}} pairs of tile ends must match. The players alternately extend the line of play with one tile at one of its two ends; if a player is unable to place a valid tile, they must keep on pulling tiles from the stock until they can. The game ends when one player wins by playing their last tile, or when the game is blocked because neither player can play. If that occurs, whoever caused the block <b>gets</b> <b>all</b> of the remaining player points not counting their own.|$|E

Lennon's reaction was, [...] "Jesus Christ! He <b>gets</b> <b>all</b> the credit for it!" [...] He later wrote, [...] "I started the band. I disbanded it. It's as simple as that." [...] In later interviews with Rolling Stone magazine, he revealed his bitterness towards McCartney, saying, [...] "I was a fool not to do what Paul did, which was use it to sell a record." [...] Lennon also spoke of the hostility he perceived the other members had towards Ono, and of how he, Harrison, and Starr [...] "got fed up with being sidemen for Paul...

[...] American music journalist Robert Christgau enjoyed the album's central theme of sex and wrote: [...] "when she <b>gets</b> <b>all</b> soprano on your ass you could accuse her of spirituality". A more lukewarm review came from Pitchforks Ryan Schreiber, who felt that: [...] "while undeniably beautiful, Vespertine fails to give electronic music the forward push it received on Björk's preceding albums". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly said [...] "her lyrics occasionally dive into the deep end" [...] and [...] "her voice is at times stiff", although he also wrote [...] "when it all comes together, [...] Björk and her electronica collaborators create moving interplanetary chorals". Almost Cool wrote: [...] "if there's one question to be raised with the album, it's that it's all simply so lush and nice that on some levels it fails to excite". Various reviews named Vespertine Björk's best album to date, including The A.V. Club, Rolling Stone, About.com, and PopMatters.|$|E

"Can't Hold Us Down" [...] lyrically {{discusses}} feminism; {{the song}} criticizes [...] "common" [...] gender-related double standards, {{in which men}} are applauded for their sexual behaviors, while women who behave {{in a similar fashion}} are disdained. In the book Therapeutic Uses of Rap and Hip-Hop, Susan Hadley and George Yancy discuss that [...] "Can't Hold Us Down" [...] is a hip hop song that [...] "encourages young women to be proud, strong, and empowered to be all that they can be". At the song's first verse, Aguilera sings [...] "Call me a bitch 'cause I speak what's on my mind / Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled"; she later rejects that all women [...] "should be seen, not heard" [...] and encourages them to [...] "shout louder" [...] during the chorus. Aguilera comments on the double standard with the lyrics [...] "The guy <b>gets</b> <b>all</b> the glory the more he can score / While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore". Lil' Kim shares a similar sentiment during her verse in the bridge, questioning why a man is able to give a woman [...] "some sex or sex her raw" [...] while [...] "if the girl do the same and then she's a whore".|$|E
500|$|Similar to many {{fighting}} games, {{the aim is}} for {{the player}} to reduce their opponent's HP to zero. A character's offensive (and, to a lesser extent, defensive) power is shown in numerical form called BRV or [...] "Bravery Points". Both characters {{start out with a}} set amount of BRV, and each must reduce their health to 0 by attacking them with a HP attack. Players can steal BRV from their opponent by attacking them with the basic [...] "BRV attack" [...] to add it to their own total and gain the upper hand. Players can then use the [...] "HP attack" [...] to cause direct damage to their opponent; HP damage is equal to the player's current amount of Bravery. However, once an HP attack is used, the character's own BRV is reduced to 0 and then slowly recovers to its starting amount. A character whose BRV total has been depleted (past 0 BRV and into the negatives) is forced into [...] "Break mode", where, aside from not being able to cause HP and BRV damage (But being able to gain BRV), all attacks made against them cause critical damage and the opponent <b>gets</b> <b>all</b> of the BRV in the [...] "Bravery Pool" [...] (a number that can be seen {{at the bottom of the}} screen), massively boosting their BRV amount.|$|E

500|$|Before the 1946 season, Feller {{signed a}} $50,000 {{contract}} for the year, including a bonus for attendance, as the Indians felt many were attending baseball games primarily to see him; he was offered $100,000 by Jorge Pasquel {{to play in the}} Mexican League, but declined to leave the States again. Feller recorded his second career no-hitter on April 30, 1946, against the New York Yankees. He allowed five walks and struck out 11 Yankees. Feller said of the game, [...] "The no-hitter on opening day in Chicago is the one that <b>gets</b> <b>all</b> the attention. But my no-hitter at Yankee Stadium was against a much better team than the White Sox. There was no comparison. I had to pitch to Tommy Henrich, Charlie Keller and Joe DiMaggio in the ninth inning to get the Yankees out." [...] At one point during the season (as Feller thought he might be nearing Rube Waddell's AL record for strikeouts), Feller confirmed Waddell's record of 344 strikeouts with the AL office as opposed to 349. In his last appearance of the season on September 29, Feller threw five strikeouts against the Detroit Tigers to set the then-AL single-season strikeout record. During the 1946 season, he registered career-highs in strikeouts (348), games started (42) and games pitched (48), shutouts (10), complete games (36) and innings pitched (377.1)—all major league bests that season. Feller finished 26–15 with an ERA of 2.18, the latter a career-low. Nearly 20 years later, Feller recalled, [...] "For the 1946 season, though, the Indians were so thin in pitching that Boudreau decided I was to pitch every fourth day, regardless of rainouts, open dates, or anything else." ...|$|E
