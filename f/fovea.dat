5|$|Although {{they lack}} a <b>fovea,</b> some diurnal lemurs have a cone-rich, {{although}} less clustered, area centralis. This area centralis {{has a high}} rod-to-cone cell ratio in many diurnal species studied thus far, whereas diurnal anthropoids have no rod cells in their <b>fovea.</b> Once again, this suggests lower visual acuity in lemurs than in anthropoids. Furthermore, the rod-to-cone cell ratio can be variable even among diurnal species. For instance, Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) and the indri (Indri indri) {{have only a few}} large cones scattered along their predominantly rod-dominated retina. The eyes of the ring-tailed lemur contain one cone to five rods. Nocturnal lemurs such as mouse lemurs and dwarf lemurs, on the other hand, have retinas made up entirely of rod cells.|$|E
5|$|Like all primates, strepsirrhine orbits (eye sockets) have a postorbital bar, a {{protective}} ring of bone {{created by a}} connection between the frontal and zygomatic bones. Both living and extinct strepsirrhines lack a thin wall of bone behind the eye, referred to as postorbital closure, which is only seen in haplorhine primates. Although the eyes of strepsirrhines point forward, giving stereoscopic vision, the orbits do not face fully forward. Among living strepsirrhines, most or all species are thought to possess a reflective layer behind the retina of the eye, called a tapetum lucidum (consisting of riboflavin crystals), which improves vision in low light, but they lack a <b>fovea,</b> which improves day vision. This differs from tarsiers, which lack a tapetum lucidum but possess a <b>fovea.</b>|$|E
5|$|Adaptations {{to night}} vision include the large {{size of the}} eye, its tubular shape, large numbers of closely packed retinal rods, and an absence of cone cells, since rod cells have {{superior}} light sensitivity. There are few coloured oil drops, which would reduce the light intensity. Unlike diurnal birds of prey, owls normally have only one <b>fovea,</b> and that is poorly developed except in daytime hunters like the short-eared owl.|$|E

5|$|The {{nervous system}} is large {{relative}} to the bird's size. The most developed {{part of the brain}} is the one that controls the flight-related functions, while the cerebellum coordinates movement and the cerebrum controls behaviour patterns, navigation, mating and nest building. Most birds have a poor sense of smell with notable exceptions including kiwis, New World vultures and tubenoses. The avian visual system is usually highly developed. Water birds have special flexible lenses, allowing accommodation for vision in air and water. Some species also have dual <b>fovea.</b> Birds are tetrachromatic, possessing ultraviolet (UV) sensitive cone cells in the eye as well as green, red and blue ones.|$|E
5|$|Z. ferox is {{only known}} from small, {{wingless}} females. The head {{is similar to}} those of queens of Z. tonsora, but they can be separated by the lack of ocelli and rugose patches found on the vertex. Only a single row of denticles is present, and the vertexal margin (seen posterodorsally) is concave. The mesosoma is smooth and contains a single spine, <b>fovea</b> (a pit or depression in a structure) or carina (a keel-like elevation on the body-wall of an insect). The posterior portion of the propodeal surface is concave; it is high and strongly angled. All legs have flattened femurs (the largest region of an insect's leg) and tibiae, and the tibiae are carinated both anteriorly and posteriorly. The gaster (the bulbous posterior portion of the metasoma) has five known segments. Like the queen, Z. ferox has a large, retractable stinger, in which the external part is enclosed by the gonostyli (sting sheaths).|$|E
25|$|A {{challenge}} for any diving bird {{is the change}} in refraction between air and water. The eyes of many birds have two foveae (the <b>fovea</b> is {{the area of the}} retina the greatest density of light receptors), and a kingfisher is able to switch from the main central <b>fovea</b> to the auxiliary <b>fovea</b> when it enters water; a retinal streak of high receptor density which connects the two foveae allows the image to swing temporally as the bird drops onto the prey. The egg-shaped lens of the eye points towards the auxiliary <b>fovea,</b> enabling the bird to maintain visual acuity underwater. Because of the positions of the foveae, the kingfisher has monocular vision in air, and binocular vision in water. The underwater vision is not as a sharp as in air, but the ability to judge the distance of moving prey {{is more important than the}} sharpness of the image.|$|E

25|$|Towards {{the centre}} of the retina is the <b>fovea</b> (or the less specialised, area centralis) which has a greater density of receptors and is the area of {{greatest}} forward visual acuity, i.e. sharpest, clearest detection of objects. In 54% of birds, including birds of prey, kingfishers, hummingbirds and swallows, there is second <b>fovea</b> for enhanced sideways viewing. The optic nerve is a bundle of nerve fibres which carry messages from the eye to the relevant parts of the brain and vice versa. Like mammals, birds have a small blind spot without photoreceptors at the optic disc, under which the optic nerve and blood vessels join the eye.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{distribution}} of cones in the eye, the tristimulus values depend on the observer's field of view. To eliminate this variable, the CIE defined a color-mapping function called the standard (colorimetric) observer, to represent an average human's chromatic response within a 2° arc inside the <b>fovea.</b> This angle was chosen owing {{to the belief that}} the color-sensitive cones resided within a 2° arc of the <b>fovea.</b> Thus the CIE 1931 Standard Observer function is also known as the CIE 1931 2° Standard Observer. A more modern but less-used alternative is the CIE 1964 10° Standard Observer, which is derived from the work of Stiles and Burch, and Speranskaya.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, cone {{cells are}} less {{sensitive}} to the overall intensity of light, but come in three varieties that are sensitive to different frequency-ranges and thus {{are used in the}} perception of colour and photopic vision. Cone cells are highly concentrated in the <b>fovea</b> and have a high visual acuity meaning that they are better at spatial resolution than rod cells. Since cone cells are not as sensitive to dim light as rod cells, most night vision is limited to rod cells. Likewise, since cone cells are in the <b>fovea,</b> central vision (including the vision needed to do most reading, fine detail work such as sewing, or careful examination of objects) is done by cone cells.|$|E

25|$|The {{forward-facing}} {{eyes of a}} bird of prey give binocular vision, {{which is}} assisted by a double <b>fovea.</b> The raptor's adaptations for optimum visual resolution (an American kestrel can see a 2–mm insect {{from the top of}} an 18–m tree) has a disadvantage in that its vision is poor in low light level, and it must roost at night. Raptors may have to pursue mobile prey in the lower part of their visual field, and therefore do not have the lower field myopia adaptation demonstrated by many other birds. Scavenging birds like vultures do not need such sharp vision, so a condor has only a single <b>fovea</b> with about 35,000 receptors mm2. Vultures, however have high physiological activity of many important enzymes to suit their distant clarity of vision.|$|E
25|$|The visual {{ability of}} {{birds of prey}} is legendary, and the keenness of their {{eyesight}} {{is due to a}} variety of factors. Raptors have large eyes for their size, 1.4 times greater than the average for birds of the same weight, and the eye is tube-shaped to produce a larger retinal image. The resolving power of an eye depends both on the optics, large eyes with large appertures suffers less from diffraction and can have larger retinal images due to a long focal length, and on the density of receptor spacing. The retina has a large number of receptors per square millimeter, which determines the degree of visual acuity. The more receptors an animal has, the higher its ability to distinguish individual objects at a distance, especially when, as in raptors, each receptor is typically attached to a single ganglion. Many raptors have foveas with far more rods and cones than the human <b>fovea</b> (65,000/mm2 in American kestrel, 38,000 in humans) and this provides these birds with spectacular long distance vision. It is proposed that the shape of the deep central <b>fovea</b> of raptors can create a telephoto optical system, increasing the size of the retinal image in the <b>fovea</b> and thereby increasing the spatial resolution. Behavioural studies show that some large eyed raptors (Wedge-tailed eagle, Old world vultures) and have ca 2 times higher spatial resolution than humans, but many medium and small sized raptors have comparable or lower spatial resolution.|$|E
25|$|In ophthalmology, {{binocular}} retinal birefringence {{screening of}} the Henle fibers (photoreceptor axons that go radially outward from the <b>fovea)</b> provides a reliable detection of strabismus and possibly also of anisometropic amblyopia. Furthermore, scanning laser polarimetry utilises the birefringence of the optic nerve fibre layer to indirectly quantify its thickness, which is of use in the assessment and monitoring of glaucoma.|$|E
50|$|Normal retinal {{correspondence}} (NRC) is a binocular {{condition in}} which both <b>foveas</b> work together as corresponding retinal points, with resultant images fused in the occipital cortex of the brain.|$|R

25|$|Long-term or {{permanent}} damage includes solar retinopathy, which {{occurs when the}} sun burns {{a hole in the}} retina, usually at the <b>fovea</b> (the focus of the retina). Symptoms can occur as long as several weeks after the incident, and can include loss of central vision and/or other vision, as well as eye pain and light sensitivity, afterimages, and changes in color vision.|$|E
25|$|The {{experiments}} {{were conducted by}} using a circular split screen (a bipartite field) 2 degrees in diameter, which is the angular size of the human <b>fovea.</b> On {{one side of the}} field a test color was projected and on the other side, an observer-adjustable color was projected. The adjustable color was a mixture of three primary colors, each with fixed chromaticity, but with adjustable brightness.|$|E
25|$|Cones are {{responsible}} for colour vision. They require brighter light to function than rods require. In humans, there are three types of cones, maximally sensitive to long-wavelength, medium-wavelength, and short-wavelength light (often referred to as red, green, and blue, respectively, though the sensitivity peaks are not actually at these colours). The colour seen is the combined effect of stimuli to, and responses from, these three types of cone cells. Cones are mostly concentrated in and near the <b>fovea.</b> Only a few are present {{at the sides of}} the retina. Objects are seen most sharply in focus when their images fall on the <b>fovea,</b> as when one looks at an object directly. Cone cells and rods are connected through intermediate cells in the retina to nerve fibres of the optic nerve. When rods and cones are stimulated by light, they connect through adjoining cells within the retina to send an electrical signal to the optic nerve fibres. The optic nerves send off impulses through these fibres to the brain.|$|E

The promesonotal suture (a rigid joint between two or more hard elements of an organism) is also well developed and complete. The sulcus is known to demarcate the entirety of the ants' mesoscutum and mesoscutellum. When measured, the scutellum is approximately half the length of the scutum, and the scutellums dorsal surface has a pair of deep, rectangular-shaped <b>foveae</b> that is located nearby the median line. The dorsellum is well developed and has a pair of shallow <b>foveae.</b> The pronotum contains little to no <b>foveae</b> or setae, but it is fully developed. The mesopleuron is separated from the mesosoma by complete sulci, and when viewed dorsally, it bears a series of C-shaped grooves and <b>foveae.</b> The propodeum measures [...] long and sports a slit-like spiracle which faces to the rear; the posterior margin of the propodeum is shelf-like and medically emarginates. The metapleural gland has a large, crescent shaped opening and well developed metapleural bulla. Trochantellus is found on all legs, and they are very well separated from the trochanter (leg part attached rigidly to the femur) and femur on both the meso- and metathoracic legs (the middle and hindmost pair of legs).

25|$|For a {{human eye}} with {{excellent}} acuity, the maximum theoretical resolution is 50 CPD (1.2 arcminute per line pair, or a 0.35mm line pair, at 1 m). A rat can resolve only about 1 to 2 CPD. A horse has higher acuity {{through most of}} the visual field of its eyes than a human has, but does not match the high acuity of the human eye's central <b>fovea</b> region.|$|E
25|$|Rods cannot {{distinguish}} colours, but {{are responsible}} for low-light (scotopic) monochrome (black-and-white) vision; they work well in dim light as they contain a pigment, rhodopsin (visual purple), which is sensitive at low light intensity, but saturates at higher (photopic) intensities. Rods are distributed throughout the retina but there are none at the <b>fovea</b> and none at the blind spot. Rod density is greater in the peripheral retina than in the central retina.|$|E
