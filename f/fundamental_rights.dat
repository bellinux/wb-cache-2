5|$|The <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Rights</b> are not {{absolute}} and {{are subject to}} reasonable restrictions as necessary {{for the protection of}} public interest. In the Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala case in 1973, the Supreme Court, overruling a previous decision of 1967, held that the <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Rights</b> could be amended, subject to judicial review in case such an amendment violated the basic structure of the Constitution. The <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Rights</b> can be enhanced, removed or otherwise altered through a constitutional amendment, passed by a two-thirds majority of each House of Parliament. The imposition of a state of emergency may lead to a temporary suspension any of the <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Rights,</b> excluding Articles 20 and 21, by order of the President. The President may, by order, suspend the right to constitutional remedies as well, thereby barring citizens from approaching the Supreme Court for the enforcement of any of the <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Rights,</b> except Articles 20 and 21, during the period of the emergency. Parliament may also restrict the application of the <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Rights</b> to members of the Indian Armed Forces and the police, in order to ensure proper discharge of their duties and the maintenance of discipline, by a law made under Article 33.|$|E
5|$|The Right to Constitutional Remedies {{empowers}} {{citizens to}} approach the Supreme Court of India to seek enforcement, or protection against infringement, of their <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Rights.</b> Article 32 provides a guaranteed remedy, {{in the form of}} a Fundamental Right itself, for enforcement of all the other <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Rights,</b> and the Supreme Court is designated as the protector of these rights by the Constitution. The Supreme Court has been empowered to issue writs, namely habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari and quo warranto, for the enforcement of the <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Rights,</b> while the High Courts have been empowered under Article 226 – which is not a Fundamental Right in itself – to issue these prerogative writs even in cases not involving the violation of <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Rights.</b> The Supreme Court has the jurisdiction to enforce the <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Rights</b> even against private bodies, and in case of any violation, award compensation as well to the affected individual. Exercise of jurisdiction by the Supreme Court can also be suo motu or on the basis of a public interest litigation. This right cannot be suspended, except under the provisions of Article 359 when a state of emergency is declared.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Rights</b> is to {{preserve}} individual liberty and democratic principles based on equality of all members of society. Dr Ambedkar said that {{the responsibility of the}} legislature is not just to provide <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> but also and rather more importantly, to safeguard them.|$|E
50|$|Raw {{milk and}} herdshare advocates argue that {{individuals}} have a <b>fundamental</b> <b>right</b> to contract, {{or in the}} alternative, that individuals have a <b>fundamental</b> <b>right</b> to consume and grow the foods of their choice. Courts have rejected both of these arguments.|$|R
50|$|Education as a <b>fundamental</b> <b>right.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} opinion, {{reversing the}} District Court, {{stated that the}} appellees did not sufficiently prove a textual basis, within the US Constitution, supporting the principle that education is a <b>fundamental</b> <b>right.</b> Urging that the school financing system led to wealth-based discrimination, the plaintiffs had argued that the <b>fundamental</b> <b>right</b> to education should {{be applied to the}} States, through the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court found that there was no such <b>fundamental</b> <b>right</b> and that the unequal school financing system was not subject to strict scrutiny.|$|R
5|$|<b>Fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> {{primarily}} protect {{individuals from}} any arbitrary state actions, but some rights are enforceable against individuals. For instance, the Constitution abolishes untouchability and also prohibits begar. These provisions {{act as a}} check both on state action {{as well as the}} action of private individuals. However, these rights are not absolute or uncontrolled and are subject to reasonable restrictions as necessary for the protection of general welfare. They can also be selectively curtailed. The Supreme Court has ruled that all provisions of the Constitution, including <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> can be amended. However, the Parliament cannot alter the basic structure of the constitution. Since the <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> can be altered only by a constitutional amendment, their inclusion is a check not only on the executive branch but also on the Parliament and state legislatures.|$|E

Seven <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> were originally provided by the Constitution– right to equality, right to freedom, right against exploitation, right to freedom of religion, cultural and educational rights, right to property and right to constitutional remedies. However, the right to property was removed from Part III of the Constitution by the 44th Amendment in 1978.|$|E

5|$|During {{the final}} stages of the British raj, the 1946 Cabinet Mission to India {{proposed}} a Constituent Assembly to draft a Constitution for India as {{part of the process of}} transfer of power. The Constituent Assembly of India, composed of indirectly elected representatives from the British provinces and Princely states, commenced its proceedings in December 1946, and completed drafting the Constitution of India by November 1949. According to the Cabinet Mission plan, the Assembly was to have an Advisory Committee to advise it on the nature and extent of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights,</b> protection of minorities and administration of tribal areas. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee was constituted in January 1947 with 64 members, and from among these a twelve-member sub-committee on <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Rights</b> was appointed under the chairmanship of J.B. Kripalani in February 1947. The sub-committee drafted the <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Rights</b> and submitted its report to the Committee by April 1947, and later that month the Committee placed it before the Assembly, which debated and discussed the rights over the course of the following year, adopting the drafts of most of them by, December 1948. The drafting of the <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Rights</b> was influenced by the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the U.N. General Assembly and the activities of the United Nations Human Rights Commission, as well as decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court in interpreting the Bill of Rights in the American Constitution. The Directive Principles, which were also drafted by the sub-committee on <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Rights,</b> expounded the socialist precepts of the Indian independence movement, and were inspired by similar principles contained in the Irish Constitution. The Fundamental Duties were later added to the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment in 1976.|$|E

25|$|The Supreme Court usually looks {{first to}} see whether the <b>right</b> is a <b>fundamental</b> <b>right</b> by {{examining}} whether it is deeply rooted in American history and traditions. If the right is not a <b>fundamental</b> <b>right,</b> the court applies a rational basis test: if the violation of the right can be rationally related to a legitimate government purpose, the law is then held valid. If the court establishes that the right being violated is a <b>fundamental</b> <b>right,</b> it applies strict scrutiny and asks whether the law is justified by a compelling state interest and whether the law is narrowly tailored to address that interest.|$|R
5|$|In Malaysian Bar v. Government of Malaysia (1987), the Supreme Court of Malaysia {{referred}} to the strict scrutiny approach but asserted that in reality it was not {{very different from the}} traditional rational nexus standard, which it then proceeded to apply. The Court's endorsement of strict scrutiny was much less ambiguous in Government of Malaysia v. V.R. Menon (1990). It held that the impugned Act was concerned with economic and social welfare and not <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights,</b> and therefore the trial judge had erred in applying a stricter standard of review. As such, the court implicitly endorsed the application of the strict scrutiny test in cases concerning <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|The Directive Principles {{have been}} used to uphold the Constitutional {{validity}} of legislations in case of a conflict with the <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Rights.</b> Article 31C, added by the 25th Amendment in 1971, provided that any law made to give effect to the Directive Principles in Article 39(b)–(c) would not be invalid {{on the grounds that they}} derogated from the <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Rights</b> conferred by Articles 14, 19 and 31. The application of this article was sought to be extended to all the Directive Principles by the 42nd Amendment in 1970, but the Supreme Court struck down the extension as void on the ground that it violated the basic structure of the Constitution. The <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Rights</b> and Directive Principles have also been used together in forming the basis of legislation for social welfare. The Supreme Court, after the judgement in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has adopted the view of the <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Rights</b> and Directive Principles being complementary to each other, each supplementing the other's role in aiming at the same goal of establishing a welfare state by means of social revolution. Similarly, the Supreme Court has used the Fundamental Duties to uphold the Constitutional validity of statutes which seeks to promote the objects laid out in the Fundamental Duties. These Duties have also been held to be obligatory for all citizens, subject to the State enforcing the same by means of a valid law. The Supreme Court has also issued directions to the State in this regard, with a view towards making the provisions effective and enabling a citizens to properly perform their duties.|$|E

5|$|These <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> help {{not only}} in {{protection}} but also the prevention of gross violations of human rights. They emphasise on the fundamental unity of India by guaranteeing to all citizens the access {{and use of the}} same facilities, irrespective of background. Some <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> apply for persons of any nationality whereas others are available only to the citizens of India. The right to life and personal liberty is available to all people and so is the right to freedom of religion. On the other hand, freedoms of speech and expression and freedom to reside and settle in any part of the country are reserved to citizens alone, including non-resident Indian citizens. The right to equality in matters of public employment cannot be conferred to overseas citizens of India.|$|E
5|$|Changes to the <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> {{require a}} {{constitutional}} amendment, {{which has to}} be passed by a special majority of both houses of Parliament. This means that an amendment requires the approval of two-thirds of the members present and voting.

They also forbid trafficking of human beings and forced labour (a crime). They also protect cultural and educational rights of ethnic and religious minorities by allowing them to preserve their languages and also establish and administer their own education institutions.
