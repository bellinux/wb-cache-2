25|$|The real {{exchange}} rate appreciated through 1981 and 1982, public sector investment rose 54 percent {{in real terms}} from 1979 to 1982, and public sector consumption rose 25 percent during the same three-year period. The combination effectively turned the current-account surplus into a large deficit, as increased spending plus import liberalization practically doubled imports {{of goods and services}} between 1979 and 1981. The appreciation also turned manufacturing exports back downward, and a plunge in external prices of primary exports brought them down too. And then the mistake of focusing on the earlier export surplus as the main cause of inflation became clear: the increases in spending led to a leap of inflation despite the return to an <b>external</b> <b>deficit.</b> The rate of inflation went from 59 percent in 1980 to 111 percent by 1983.|$|E
25|$|The <b>external</b> <b>deficit</b> {{was driven}} up {{primarily}} by {{high rates of}} growth of domestic demand and production through 1974. But in addition, the government's policy of holding to a fixed nominal exchange rate, in an increasingly inflationary context, allowed the real exchange rate to fall steadily from 1969 to 1975. The government refused to consider devaluation for fear it would worsen inflation and managed to avoid it by borrowing abroad to finance the continuing deficit. By 1975 external creditors had lost confidence in Peru's ability to repay its debts and began {{to put on the}} brakes. Whether because of such external pressure or because of growing internal opposition to the increasingly arbitrary decisions of the government, the Peruvian military decided to replace Velasco in 1975. The experiment ended on a note of defeat, not so much of its objectives as of its methods.|$|E
25|$|The two {{horsemen}} of {{this particular}} apocalypse—the <b>external</b> <b>deficit</b> and the swift rise of Central Bank credit—would have made 1988 a bad year no matter what else happened. But President García guaranteed financial disaster by his totally unexpected decision in July 1987 to nationalize the banks not already under government ownership. No one has yet been able {{to explain why he}} decided to do so. It would not seem to have been a move necessary for any component of his program, or needed for government control in a banking sector in which it already had a dominant position. In any case, the action underlined the unilateral character of economic policy action under Peru's presidential system and wrecked any possibilities of further cooperation with private sector leadership. Private investment began to fall, and the whole economy followed it down shortly thereafter.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses cointegration and multicointegration {{analysis}} {{to explore the}} issue of twin deficits for the USA in the post-World War II period. The results suggest that prior to 1974 the systems of fiscal and foreign sector variables exhibit multicointegration. These results do not rule out short-run correlations between government <b>deficits</b> and <b>external</b> <b>deficits.</b> However, they do preclude {{the possibility that the}} twin deficit phenomenon describes a long-run structural relationship in the post-World War II, Bretton Woods era. In the more recent period, 1974 forward, neither system exhibits evidence of multi/cointegration. But, weak evidence of cointegration is present between fiscal deficits and trade deficits. Error correction models suggest that causality runs from internal to <b>external</b> <b>deficits</b> in the dynamic adjustment process. This evidence provides some support for the notion that more recently fiscal deficits may have contributed to <b>external</b> <b>deficits.</b> In combination with the results from the early sub-period, the evidence indicates that to the extent the twin deficit relationship exists, it is time specific and weak. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{financial}} crisis caused an unprecedented drop {{in demand for}} size and abruptness. After a successful co-ordinated fiscal stimulus to contain financial sector risks and second round effects, most western economies now find themselves with weak prospects for recovery in demand and with no bullets left in terms of room for further fiscal expansions. After a relatively widespread global slump, the outlook now varies greatly across world regions. Demand remains weak especially in those world regions where net savings are adjusting {{in such a way}} to rebalance <b>external</b> <b>deficits.</b> Against this background, the EU and the euro area itself cannot be considered as homogenous areas because some countries (“the center”) record external surpluses and a strong recovery while the periphery is generally characterized by <b>external</b> <b>deficits,</b> deteriorated fiscal positions, and weak or negative growth rates...|$|R
25|$|The {{decision}} to remove {{controls on the}} exchange rate had been expected {{to lead to a}} much higher foreign-exchange price, to encourage exports, and to permit import liberalization without a surging <b>external</b> <b>deficit.</b> But when the rate was set free, the price of dollars went down instead of going up. That initial effect could be explained by the tight restraints imposed on liquidity, which drove firms and individuals who held dollar balances to convert them to domestic currency in order to keep operating. This movement should presumably have gone into reverse when holdings of dollars ran out, but fully eighteen months later no reversal had occurred. Dollars remained too cheap to make exports profitable and too cheap for many producers to compete against imports for several reasons, including the continuing influx of dollars from the drug trade into street markets and then into the banking system. A second reason has involved the continuing low level of domestic income and production, and corresponding restraint of demand for imports as compared with what they would be in an expanding economy. But perhaps the most fundamental reasons have been the continuing squeeze on liquidity in terms of domestic currency and the resulting high rates of interest for borrowing domestic currency, which strongly favor borrowing dollars instead or repatriating them from abroad. All this means that the economy has had no foreign-exchange problem, but also that incentives to produce for export have been held down severely, when both near-term recovery and longer-term growth badly need the stimulus of rising exports.|$|E
25|$|The García {{government}} {{reacted to}} the growing <b>external</b> <b>deficit</b> {{in exactly the same}} way as had the governments of Velasco and of Belaúnde—by postponing corrective action while the problem continued to worsen. As ever, a major fear was that devaluation would worsen inflation. Inflationary pressures were, in fact, beginning to worsen behind the façade of control. To some degree, they were growing in response to the high rate of growth of demand and output, reducing margins of previously underutilized productive capacity. But the more explosive pressures were being built up by relying on price controls that required a dramatic expansion of credit to keep the system in place. Prices of public sector services—gasoline above all, oil products in general, electricity, telephones, and postal services—were frozen at levels that soon became almost ridiculous in real terms. The restrictions on prices charged by state firms drove them ever deeper into deficits that had to be financed by borrowing. The borrowing came from wherever it could, but principally from the Central Bank. At the same time, Central Bank credit rose steadily to keep financing agricultural expansion. Still another direction of Central Bank credit creation was the financing used to handle the government's new structure of multiple exchange rates. Differential rates were used to hold down the cost of foreign exchange for most imports, again with the dominant goal of holding down inflation, while higher prices of foreign exchange were paid to exporters to protect their incentives to export. The Central Bank thus paid more for the foreign exchange it bought than it received for the exchange it sold.|$|E
2500|$|In {{economic}} terms, Wilson's {{first three}} years in office were dominated by an ultimately doomed effort {{to stave off the}} devaluation of the pound. He inherited an unusually large <b>external</b> <b>deficit</b> on the balance of trade. This partly reflected the preceding government's expansive fiscal policy {{in the run-up to the}} 1964 election, and the incoming Wilson team tightened the fiscal stance in response.

In the latter half of 1967, however, an attempt was made to prevent the recession in activity from going too far in the form of a stimulus to consumer durable spending through an easing of credit, which in turn prevented a winter rise in unemployment.|$|E
