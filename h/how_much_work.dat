5|$|Once {{he moved}} to Nutting, Bushnell took over the {{majority}} of the engineering work for the game; Dabney has stated that he advised Bushnell on some of the design, and that some of the construction was done by Steve Bristow, an intern at Ampex. There is disagreement in interviews with Bushnell and Dabney as to <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>work</b> Dabney did on the final cabinet, with Dabney claiming credit for the controls, sound, power supply, initial wooden cabinet, and invention of the hyperspace color inversion, while Bushnell claims credit for everything but the sound, cabinet, power supply, and monitor. By August 1971, an initial prototype of the game—now named Computer Space to be similar to Computer Quiz—was complete, and Syzygy moved on to location testing. They installed the game at the Dutch Goose bar near Stanford University, where it met with great success. Nutting was heartened by the response and rushed to make several finished cabinets for the Music Operators of America (MOA) Music & Amusement Machines Exposition in October. Further location tests found a less enthusiastic response from customers confused by the game mechanics and controls, and Syzygy hurriedly tried to adjust the game to be more understandable to players.|$|E
5|$|To {{encourage}} individual {{workers to}} work hard and produce as much as they possibly could, most workers in Soviet industry were paid on a piece-rate; their wage payments depended upon <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>work</b> they personally completed. Soviet workers were given individual quotas for the amount of work they should personally deliver and would earn a basic wage (stavka) by fulfilling 100 percent of their quota. The wage rate for work would grow as production over this level increased. If a worker produced 120 percent of his own personal quota for the month (for example, if he was supposed to produce 1,000 items, but actually produced 1,200) he would receive his basic wage for the first 100 percent, a higher rate for the first 10 percent of over production and an even higher rate for the next 10 percent. Soviet authorities hoped that this would encourage a Stakhanovite spirit of overfulfillment of quotas among the Soviet workforce. In 1956, approximately 75 percent of Soviet workers were paid under such a piece-rate system, so the majority of Soviet workers could significantly boost their earnings by increasing their output.|$|E

25|$|However, Joule's {{interest}} {{diverted from}} the narrow financial question {{to that of}} <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>work</b> could be extracted from a given source, leading him to speculate about the convertibility of energy. In 1843 he published results of experiments showing that the heating effect he had quantified in 1841 was due to generation of heat in the conductor and not its transfer from {{another part of the}} equipment. This was a direct challenge to the caloric theory which held that heat could neither be created or destroyed. Caloric theory had dominated thinking in the science of heat since introduced by Antoine Lavoisier in 1783. Lavoisier's prestige and the practical success of Sadi Carnot's caloric theory of the heat engine since 1824 ensured that the young Joule, working outside either academia or the engineering profession, had a difficult road ahead. Supporters of the caloric theory readily pointed to the symmetry of the Peltier–Seebeck effect to claim that heat and current were convertible in an, at least approximately, reversible process.|$|E

Lopez-De La Cruz also assisted farmworkers by translating for them, taking them to the doctors, writing letters, and filling out paperwork for {{those who could not}} write. In addition to her work protesting, organizing, and running the hiring hall; Lopez-De La Cruz acted as an interpreter for farm workers and often testified at hearings on farm labor, pushed for food stamps for farm workers in Fresno, pushed for bilingual education, and was eventually appointed to community and state organizations like the Fresno County Economic Opportunity Commission, the Central California Action Associates (Community education project where she taught English to Farm workers), and California’s Commission on the Status of Women. In 1966 Lopez-De La Cruz volunteered to teach farm workers practical English at the CCAA in an old building on Olive Avenue in Fresno, CA. When the CCAA got a local TV show on Fresno’s Channel 53, Lopez-De La Cruz enthusiastically taught English on the show for a short period that ended when Arnold’s truck broke down. Lopez-De La Cruz also assisted the UFW by consulting as an expert farmworker. In 1971, Delores Huerta reached out to Lopez-De La Cruz to help her negotiate a contract with Christian Brothers Wine Company. Since she was a farm worker and Huerta was not, Lopez-De La Cruz could accurately know <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>work</b> was acceptable and for what pay. In 1972 she represented the Christian Brothers Workers at the first convention of the United Farm Workers of America in Fresno.|$|E

500|$|The team {{wanted to}} make the game as {{consistently}} realistic as possible, wishing to avoid the situation of realistic character models standing in front of low-resolution backgrounds. They created varying degrees of technical advancement for different locations: the most realistic location they created was the Detroit hub, while the most advanced was the two-level fictional metropolis of Hengsha. Architecture in the Detroit area was inspired by then-modern buildings from Japan and Europe. Jacques-Belletête spent a long time researching furniture designs while creating interiors for in-game environments, joking that they could fill an IKEA catalogue with the results. Multiple other hub locations were planned, including the upper levels of Hengsha, and an area of Montreal dubbed [...] "Plateau" [...] that featured [...] "very specific architecture, called tri-plexes, with twirling exterior staircases made of [...] old metal". At the beginning of production, there were even plans to feature a hub location in India.

2500|$|Jerôme is {{generally}} regarded as a skilled sculptor, but a less original or innovative artist than his brother François. His artistic talent has been questioned based on assumptions surrounding the use for his own work of designs made by his brother, {{and in particular the}} designs for the bust (now in the Louvre Museum in Paris) and the tomb of Bishop Triest. Already in 1642 Bishop Antonius Triest had approached François Duquesnoy in relation to this bust and monument and had sent along a painting of himself to be used {{as the basis for the}} bust. François had declined the commission because of his upcoming move to France but is still said to have made a few terracotta models for putti for the monument. [...] There is no documentation whether or <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>work</b> François had done on the design and execution of the bust before he died in 1643.
