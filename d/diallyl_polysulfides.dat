In agriculture, diallyl disulfide and related <b>diallyl</b> <b>polysulfides</b> show useful activity as environmentally-benign nematicides. Diallyl disulfide is also a starting material for the synthesis of allicin. In the food industry, diallyl disulfide is used to improve the taste of meat, vegetables and fruits.|$|E

5000|$|Diallyl {{disulfide}} can {{be readily}} oxidized to allicin with hydrogen peroxide or peracetic acid. Allicin in turn can hydrolyze giving diallyl disulfide and trisulfide. Reaction of diallyl disulfide with liquid sulfur gives a mixture containing <b>diallyl</b> <b>polysulfides</b> {{with as many as}} 22 sulfur atoms in a continuous chain. [...] When diallyl disulfide is heated it decomposes giving a complex mixture. The carbon-sulfur bond of diallyl disulfide is 16 kcal mol−1 weaker than the sulfur-sulfur bond (46 kcal mol−1 versus 62 kcal mol−1, respectively), with the consequence that on heating diallyl disulfide gives the allyldithio radical (AllSS•), which through addition to the double bonds in diallyl disulfide followed by fragmentation and subsequent reactions generates numerous organosulfur compounds, many of which are found in trace amounts in distilled garlic oil. In the presence of a catalyst, diallyl disulfide can combine with alkyl halides forming 1-alkylthio-3-allylthio-1-propene and 1,3-di(alkylthio)propene.|$|E
40|$|Coumarins and {{coumarin}} derivatives {{as well as}} <b>diallyl</b> <b>polysulfides</b> {{are well}} known as anticancer drugs. In order to find new drugs with anticancer activities, we combined coumarins with polysulfides {{in the form of}} di-coumarin polysulfides. These novel compounds were tested in the HCT 116 colorectal cancer cell line. It turned out that they reduced cell viability of cancer cells in a time and concentration dependent manner. Cells tested with these coumarin polysulfides accumulate in the G(2) /M phase of the cell cycle and finally they go into apoptosis. A decrease in bcl- 2 level, and increase in the level of bax, cytochrome c release into the cytosol, cleavage of caspase 3 / 7 and PARP suggested that coumarin polysulfides induced the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Comparison of these new coumarin compounds with the well known <b>diallyl</b> <b>polysulfides</b> revealed that the coumarin disulfides were more active than the corresponding diallyl disulfides. The activities of the coumarin tetrasulfides and the corresponding diallyl tetrasulfides are similar. The novel coumarin compounds regulated the phosphatase activity of the cell cycle regulating cdc 25 family members, indicating that these phosphatases are implicated in the induction of cell cycle arrest and possibly in apoptosis induction as well. In addition, coumarin polysulfides also down-regulated the level of cdc 25 C, which also contributed to the arrest in the G(2) -phase of the cell cycle. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Garlic (Allium sativum) {{contains}} {{a wide range}} of organosulfur compounds which show a variety of biological effects including broad spectrum antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activity, as well as selective anticancer activity. One highly bioactive class of compounds from garlic are <b>diallyl</b> <b>polysulfides</b> (DAS), containing one to six sulfur atoms in a linear chain. The bioactivity of DAS has been shown to increase with increasing sulfur chain length up to DAS 4 and in this study the even higher bioactivity of DAS 5 and DAS 6 was demonstrated. The bioactivity of DAS is believed to be initiated following initial reaction with intracellular low molecular weight (LMW) and protein thiols. In this study the interaction between DAS and LMW thiols was investigated {{and for the first time}} the reduced DAS metabolites allyl hydropolysulfides have been detected in vitro and in vivo in the Gram positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Additionally, formation of mixed polysulfides between DAS and LMW thiols with up to five sulfur atoms was observed in vitro. Proteomic studies revealed a large number of proteins in B. subtilis that formed mixed di- and trisulfides with DAS. Therefore multiple points of DAS attack have been proven and the disturbance of the cellular redox status through lowering the pool of reduced LMW thiols was established in two different organisms (B. subtilis and the nematode Steinernema feltiae). To exploit the polysulfide chemistry for the development of a “green” nematicide, the nematicidal activity of DAS was investigated in bioassays as well as the efficacy of DAS formulations towards plant pathogenic nematodes (Meloidogyne spp. and Globodera spp.) in potato and carrot field trials. It was demonstrated that the DAS derived nematicides form an equally effective alternative compared to synthetic nematicides at a much lower environmental and health risk...|$|E
