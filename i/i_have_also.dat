500|$|The General Assembly first {{considered}} the Civil Marriage Protection Act in 2011. Governor Martin O'Malley {{stated that he}} would sign the bill, despite urges from then-Archbishop of Baltimore Edwin Frederick O'Brien requesting that he [...] "resist pressure to do so." [...] O’Malley said [...] "I have concluded that discriminating against individuals based on their sexual orientation {{in the context of}} civil marital rights is unjust. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> concluded that treating the children of families headed by same-sex couples with lesser protections under the law than the children of families headed by heterosexual parents, is also unjust." [...] On February 24, 2011, the Senate, which was thought to be the biggest obstacle to passage, approved the bill in a 25–21 vote. The House of Delegates proved to be a challenge, where same-sex marriage advocates struggled to gain support from social conservatives from Prince George's County, southern Maryland, and the Baltimore suburbs who cited religious concerns.|$|E
500|$|Following his {{retirement}} from professional Scouting, Goodman served the National Council of Churches (NCC) during 1951–1954 as the NCC's first general {{director of the}} United Church Men, a laymen's program he formed to strengthen men's ties to local churches and their communities. Goodman publicly inaugurated the laymen's group on October 7, 1951 in Cincinnati, Ohio. By the end of 1952, United Church Men departments were formed in more than 24states, providing financial support to NCC-affiliated colleges and missionary work. His new post entailed working closely with Eugene Carson Blake, NCC president (1954–1957), and meeting frequently with officials of the participating denominations in the NCC. Speaking with various men's church groups in the U.S. and abroad was, he believed, a means of promoting brotherhood. Reflecting on his NCC service with these notable church leaders, Goodman said {{more than a decade}} later, [...] "Great faith and devoted service, I am very sure, are for ordinary folk {{as well as for the}} clergy. ... I have been privileged to know some great clergymen in my day ... but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> known and loved some truly great laymen, men whose lives and works matched their faith". Goodman retired from his NCC post on September 1, 1954 because of tuberculosis.|$|E

2500|$|The Royal Coachman {{was first}} made by John Haily a {{professional}} fly dresser living in New York City. In writing of other matters, he enclosed this fly {{for us to}} see, saying [...] "A gentleman wanted me to tie up some Coachman {{for him to take}} to the north woods and to make them extra strong, so I have tied them with a little band of silk in the middle to prevent the peacock bodies from fraying out. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> added a tail of the barred feathers of the wood-duck, and I think it makes a very handsome fly." [...] A few evenings later, a circle of us were together [...] "disputing the fly in question", one of the party claiming that numbers were [...] "quite as suitable to designate the flies as so many nonsensical names". The others did not agree with him, but he said: [...] "What can you do? Here is a fly intended to be a Coachman; {{but it is not the}} true Coachman; it is quite unlike it and what can you call it?" [...] Mr. L. C. Orvis, brother of Mr. Charles Orvis, who was present said: [...] "Oh that is easy enough; call it the Royal Coachman it is so finely dressed!" [...] And this name in time came to be known and used by all who are familiar with the fly.|$|E
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> to {{acknowledge}} receipt of a letter from Mr. H.E. Holmes of Durban, enclosing the text of a pronouncement made by the South African Board of Control to the effect that, {{in the opinion of}} that body, the contest between the MCC team and The Reef at Vogelfontein on 22 and 23 December 1909, was not a first-class match. In the course of this encounter Hobbs scored 70 runs which are counted in his first-class aggregate. Seeing that the game was regarded, {{at the time it was}} played, as first-class and until a little while ago had been left in undisputed possession of that rank, the need for raising any question about the matter after more than twenty years is not at all obvious. In any circumstances, I should not advise the dragging up of what, with all due respect to the recent ruling of the South African Board, must remain a debatable matter. The Reef team included some Test match players and others who had appeared in Inter-State games so it certainly had considerable claims to be regarded as first-class and from that standing, I cannot, all things considered, agree after such a long lapse of time to reduce it. Outside the merits of the case, is there not something rather grotesque in the idea of a controlling body sitting in solemn conclave over so small a matter and deciding to upset what had been accepted for twenty years? ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{section of}} {{scholars}} {{believe that the}} Satavahanas originated in western Deccan (present-day Maharashtra). All of the four extant inscriptions from the early Satavahana period (c. 1st century BCE) {{have been found in}} and around this region. The oldest known Satavahana inscription was found at [...] of the Pandavleni Caves in Nashik district, and was issued during the reign of Kanha (100-70 BCE). An inscription found at Naneghat was issued by Nayanika (or Naganika), the widow of Satakarni I; another inscription found at Naneghat has been dated to the same period on paleographic basis. A slightly later inscription dated to the reign of Satakarni II has been found at Sanchi in Madhya Pradesh, located to the north of Maharashtra. The majority of the other Satavahana inscriptions have also been found in western Deccan. On the other hand, the epigraphic evidence from eastern Deccan does not mention the Satavahanas before the 4th century CE. At Nevasa, a seal and coins attributed to Kanha have been discovered. Coins attributed to Satakarni <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> been discovered at Nashik, Nevasa and Pauni in Maharashtra (besides places in eastern Deccan and present-day Madhya Pradesh). Based on these evidences, some historians argue that the Satavahanas initially came to power in the area around their capital Pratishthana (modern Paithan, Maharashtra) and then expanded their territory to eastern Deccan. Carla Sinopoli cautions that the inference about the western Deccan origin of the Satavahanas is [...] "tentative at best" [...] given the small sample of early inscriptions.|$|E
2500|$|Rather less {{is known}} about the diocesan {{organisation}} of the Church of the East under the caliphate than during the Sassanian period. [...] Although the acts of several synods held between the 7th and 13th centuries were recorded (the 14th-century author ʿAbdishoʿ of Nisibis mentions the acts of the synods of Ishoʿ Bar Nun and Eliya I, for example), most have not survived. [...] The synod of the patriarch Gregory in 605 was the last ecumenical synod of the Church of the East whose acts have survived in full, though the records of local synods convened at Dairin in Beth Qatraye by the patriarch Giwargis in 676 and in Adiabene in 790 by Timothy <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> survived by chance. [...] The main sources for the episcopal organisation of the Church of the East during the Ummayad and ʿAbbasid periods are the histories of Mari, ʿAmr and Sliba, which frequently record the names and dioceses of the metropolitans and bishops present at the consecration of a patriarch or appointed by him during his reign. [...] These records tend to be patchy before the 11th century, and the chance survival of a list of bishops present at the consecration of the patriarch Yohannan IV in 900 helps to fill one of the many gaps in our knowledge. [...] The records of attendance at patriarchal consecrations must be used with caution, however, as they can give a misleading impression. [...] They inevitably gave prominence to the bishops of Mesopotamia and overlooked those of the more remote dioceses who were unable to be present. [...] These bishops were often recorded in the acts of the Sassanian synods, because they adhered to their acts by letter.|$|E
2500|$|Reading the words, [...] "And I {{appeared}} to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob," [...] in [...] a Midrash taught that God thus told Moses that God longed {{for those who}} were gone and could not be replaced – the three Patriarchs. The Midrash said that God told Moses that many times, God had revealed God's Self to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty ( [...] , El Shadai), and God had not made known to them that God's name is the Lord ( [...] , the Tetragrammaton). But still they did not criticize God's ways. To Abraham, God said in [...] "Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it, for to you will I give it," [...] yet when Abraham wanted to bury Sarah, he found no plot of ground until he had purchased one; still, he did not murmur at God's ways. God said to Isaac in [...] "Sojourn in this land [...] [...] [...] for to you, and to your seed, I will give all these lands." [...] Yet when Isaac sought water to drink, he found none; instead (as [...] reports), [...] "The herdsmen of Gerar strove with Isaac's herdsmen, saying: ‘The water is ours.'" [...] Still Isaac did not murmur at God's ways. God said to Jacob in [...] "The land on which you lie, to you will I give it, and to your seed." [...] Yet when he sought a place to pitch his tent, he found none until he purchased one for a hundred kesitah (as reported in [...] ). And still Jacob did not complain at God's ways. The Patriarchs did not ask God, as Moses did in [...] what God's name was. In contrast, at the commencement of God's commission of Moses, Moses inquired of God's name. And in [...] Moses told God, [...] "For since I came to Pharaoh [...] [...] [...] he has dealt ill with this people; neither have You delivered Your people." [...] On this account, the Midrash taught, God said in [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> established my covenant with them," [...] the Patriarchs, to give them the land, and they never complained of God's ways. And God said in [...] "I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel," [...] because they did not complain against God. Although the Israelites of that generation did not conduct themselves righteously, yet God heard their cry on account of the covenant that God had made with the Patriarchs. Hence, it says in [...] "And I have remembered My covenant. Therefore, say to the children of Israel." [...] The Midrash taught that the word [...] "therefore" [...] ( [...] , lachein) in [...] implies an oath, as it does in [...] where God says, [...] "And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli." [...] Thus, the Midrash taught that God swore to Moses that God would redeem the Israelites, so that Moses would have no reason to fear that the Attribute of Justice would retard their redemption.|$|E
