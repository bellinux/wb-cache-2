5|$|Although {{the regular}} Confederate {{military}} had a paper strength of 6,000 personnel, the first 100,000 volunteers {{from all over}} the South participated in a variety of dress. Many were from state militia outfits, which had their own state-issued uniforms. In the early battles, some Confederate units that wore dark blue uniforms were often mistaken on the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>battle</b> for the enemy. Conversely, many Union units that were originally militia units went to war wearing gray.|$|E
5|$|In Guatemala the Spanish {{routinely}} fielded indigenous allies; {{at first}} these were Nahua {{brought from the}} recently conquered Mexico, later they also included Maya. It is estimated that for every Spaniard on the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>battle,</b> {{there were at least}} 10 native auxiliaries. Sometimes there were as many as 30 indigenous warriors for every Spaniard, and the participation of these Mesoamerican allies was decisive.|$|E
5|$|The militia men {{involved}} in the Battle of Horseshoe Bend proved their ability to obey orders, act as a disciplined unit, and show bravery. Unlike at Stillman's Run, the troops waited for Colonel Henry Dodge's commands before acting on the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>battle.</b> When ordered to charge, the men obeyed and eventually won a fight that descended into a bloody hand-to-hand battle. A memorial marker was erected to commemorate the battle in 1922. Today the battleground at Horseshoe Bend is a county park.|$|E

5|$|As part of {{the bicentennial}} celebration of the battle, in 2015 Belgium minted a 2 Euro coin {{depicting}} the Lion monument over {{a map of the}} <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>battle.</b> France officially protested this issue, while the Belgian government noted that the French mint sells souvenir medals at Waterloo. After 180,000 coins were minted but not released, the issue was melted. Instead, Belgium issued an identical commemorative coin in the non-standard value of 2½ Euros. Legally only valid within the issuing country (but unlikely to circulate) it was minted in brass, packaged, and sold by the Belgian mint for 6 Euros. A 10 Euro coin, showing Wellington, Blücher, their troops and the silhouette of Napoleon, was also available in silver for 42 Euros.|$|E
5|$|Chinautla Viejo was {{attacked}} by the invading Spanish in 1525; the first two attacks against the heavily fortified city were unsuccessful. The besieged city received Poqomam reinforcements that were comprehensively defeated on an open <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>battle,</b> with the Spanish cavalry being decisive. The capture of Poqomam prisoners allowed the Spanish to discover {{the location of a}} cave providing a secret entrance to the city. A third assault broke the month-long siege, allowing the Spanish to take the city. The surviving inhabitants were moved to another settlement and Pedro de Alvarado ordered the city to be burned.|$|E
5|$|From July 1943, the 29th Infantry Division was {{commanded}} by Major General Charles H. Gerhardt. The division {{had such a}} high casualty rate that {{it was said that}} Gerhardt actually commanded three divisions: one on the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>battle,</b> one in the hospital and one in the cemetery. The 29th Infantry Division lost 3,887 killed in action, 15,541 wounded in action, 347 missing in action, 845 prisoners of war, in addition to 8,665 non-combat casualties, during 242 days of combat. This amounted to over 200 percent of the division's normal strength. The division, in turn, took 38,912 German prisoners of war.|$|E

5|$|Given {{the ferocity}} of the Russian defense, {{everyone}} was aware that {{such a move would}} cost the lives of thousands of Guardsmen, but it was thought that the presence of this prestigious unit would bolster the morale of the entire army for a final decisive push. A notable exception was Marshal Bessières, commander of the Guard cavalry, {{who was one of the}} very few senior generals to strongly advise against the intervention of the Guard. As the general staff were discussing the matter, general Rapp, a senior aide-de-camp to the Emperor, was being brought from the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>battle,</b> having been wounded in action.|$|E
5|$|In May 1800 Napoleon, by {{then the}} undisputed leader of France, brought his troops across the Alps to Italy once again. On 14June his army met the Austrian forces at the Battle of Marengo (near Alessandria). Austrian troops were {{initially}} successful; by mid-morning they were {{in control of the}} <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>battle.</b> Their commander, Michael von Melas, sent this news south towards Rome. However, fresh French troops arrived in late afternoon, and Napoleon attacked the tired Austrians. As Melas retreated in disarray with the remains of his army, he sent a second courier south with the revised message. The Neapolitans abandoned Rome, and the city spent the next fourteen years under French domination.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} years Pembroke {{worked closely with the}} King. He was appointed the King’s lieutenant in Scotland in 1314, and was present at the disastrous English defeat at the Battle of Bannockburn, where he helped lead Edward away from the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>battle.</b> In 1317, however, while returning from a papal embassy to Avignon, he was captured by a Jean de Lamouilly, and held for ransom in Germany. The ransom of £10,400 was to cause Pembroke significant financial difficulties for the remainder of his life.|$|E

50|$|After a moment, the elves get up, silent, saddle {{their horses}} {{and start to}} leave. Filavandrel bids Geralt farewell, Toruviel gives Dandelion a new lute, and they part ways.

5|$|Later on, {{being told}} by his brother, Jerome, of some gossip overheard by a waiter between British {{officers}} at lunch at the 'King of Spain' inn in Genappe that the Prussians were to march over from Wavre, Napoleon declared that the Prussians would need at least two days to recover and would {{be dealt with by}} Grouchy. Surprisingly, Jerome's overheard gossip aside, the French commanders present at the pre-battle conference at Le Caillou had no information about the alarming proximity of the Prussians and did not suspect that Blücher's men would start erupting onto the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>battle</b> in great numbers just five hours later.|$|E
5|$|The Indians were {{a harder}} fight; {{they were out}} of the main <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>battle,</b> skirmishing on the edge of an {{adjacent}} swamp. Richard Johnson eventually ordered a suicide squad of twenty men to ride forward and draw the Indians' fire, planning to charge with the rest as they reloaded. But the ground before the Indian position was too swampy to support many cavalry. Johnson had to order his men to dismount and hold until Shelby's infantry came up. But eventually they broke, and fled into the swamp, during which time Tecumseh was slain, some say by Johnson, others believing it was someone else.|$|E
5|$|The emperor's role as supreme judge {{could be}} {{temporarily}} duplicated by any official he designated {{in times of}} emergency or in distant borderlands where central government had little influence. This entailed a symbolic conferral of power, which was embodied in the Staff of Authority (Jiezhang 節杖). Roughly 2m (6ft) in height and decorated with ribbons, the Staff of Authority was often granted to an official with a specific errand, such as {{acting on behalf of}} the emperor as ambassador to a foreign country, appointing civilians to office, or immediately promoting a deserving military officer on the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>battle.</b> Moreover, it granted its bearer the authority to sentence criminals and political rebels with execution without notifying the court first.|$|E

50|$|The year is 1108 in the {{official}} calendar of the Pajan Empire. Far from the <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>battle,</b> Okko the ronin heads {{a small group of}} demon hunters, wandering the realms of Empire. He is accompanied by Noburo, a mysterious giant who hides his face behind a red oni mask, and the whimsical monk Noshin, the saké lover with the power to summon and commune with the spirits of nature.|$|R
5|$|The {{traditional}} role of cavalry in war is scouting—gathering {{information about the}} enemy's location, strength, and movements—while denying the enemy the same information about one's own forces. Other tasks include raiding into enemy territory and damaging their infrastructure and economy while avoiding conflict with enemy forces. On the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>battle,</b> cavalry were expected to charge into and break up enemy infantry and cavalry formations. The prestige gained by participating in a cavalry charge was such that additional officers would attempt to join one whenever possible. Notable examples of this include Louis Nolan of the 15th Hussars joining the Charge of the Light Brigade in the Crimean War and Winston Churchill of the 4th Hussars joining the 21st Lancers for their charge during the Battle of Omdurman.|$|E
5|$|While {{attempting}} to rally fleeing French forces during a cavalry charge, Pulaski was mortally wounded by grapeshot. The reported grapeshot {{is on display}} today at the Georgia Historical Society in Savannah; The Charleston Museum also has a grapeshot reported to be from Pulaski's wound. A wounded Pulaski was carried from the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>battle</b> and taken aboard the South Carolina merchant brig privateer Wasp, {{under the command of}} Captain Samuel Bulfinch, where he died two days later, having never regained consciousness. His death, perceived by American Patriot supporters as heroic, further boosted his reputation in America.|$|E
5|$|Gloucester was {{involved}} in a brief skirmish with the Scots on 23June, the day before the main battle. While the king considered whether to camp for the night or to engage the Scots immediately, Gloucester and Hereford – either through insubordination or a misunderstanding – charged directly into the place called the New Park, where the Scots were encamped. The English immediately ran into difficulties, and Hereford's cousin Henry de Bohun was killed by King Robert the Bruce. It was perhaps during the subsequent retreat that Gloucester was thrown off his horse, but managed to escape unharmed. The next day the English were still not entirely decided on the course of action. While Gloucester took the part of certain experienced captains, recommending that Edward avoid battle that day, the younger men surrounding the king labelled this lethargic and cowardly, and advised attack. According to the Vita Edwardi, when Edward grew angry and accused Gloucester of treason, the earl forcefully replied that he would prove his loyalty on the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>battle.</b>|$|E

In at least one case, encomienda rights were granted to one of the Tlaxcalan leaders who came as allies, and land grants and exemption from being given in encomienda were given to the Mexican allies as rewards for their participation in the conquest. In practice, such privileges were easily removed or sidestepped by the Spanish and the indigenous conquistadors were treated in a similar manner to the conquered natives.|$|E
5|$|Monmouth {{fled from}} the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>battle,</b> but was {{captured}} in a ditch on 8 July (either at Ringwood in the New Forest, or at Horton in Dorset). Parliament had passed an Act of Attainder, on 13 June sentencing Monmouth to death as a traitor, Therefore, no trial was needed before his execution. Despite begging for mercy and claims of conversion to Roman Catholicism, he was beheaded at Tower Hill by Jack Ketch on 15 July 1685. It is said that it took multiple blows of the axe to sever his head. Though some sources say it took eight blows, the official Tower of London website says it took five blows, while Charles Spencer, in his book Blenheim, claims it was seven. His dukedoms of Monmouth and Buccleuch were forfeited, but the subsidiary titles of the dukedom of Monmouth were restored to the Duke of Buccleuch.|$|E
5|$|The Kingdom Hearts games contain {{elements}} of action role-playing video games with hack-and-slash elements. The games {{are driven by}} a linear progression from one story event to the next, usually shown {{in the form of}} a cutscene, though there are numerous side quests available that provide bonus benefits to the characters. In most games, the player primarily controls the principal protagonist of the series, Sora. Sora is usually accompanied by Donald Duck and Goofy, who are artificial intelligence-controlled non-playable characters that aid Sora in battle. In the first and third game, their behavior can be altered to suit different combat objectives. The games feature real-time combat that incorporates physical attacks, magic, and summonings, though each game handles battles differently. The game also allows for items to be used on the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>battle</b> to heal oneself or one's party members.|$|E
