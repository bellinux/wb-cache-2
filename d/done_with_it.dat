As such these terms did not satisfy the requirements of either the Open Source Initiative or the Free Software Foundation to be considered open source or free software, and Sun Java was therefore a proprietary platform.|$|E

But then, I didn't send the song to the Oscars, the makers did. I just composed the tune in three weeks and was <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> However, I too feel 'Jai Ho' was apt for that particular moment in the film—the protagonist comes out of darkness and pain to light amid 'Jai Ho' hammering in the background." ...|$|E

Frear enjoyed the large variety in the music, and how the sound effects managed to keep the audio experience interesting despite their simplicity.

500|$|The {{writing process}} for this album was more {{communal}} {{compared to that}} for Hello Master; Heppner had written much of the band's debut album himself and his bandmates helped him in arranging the material, but the sophomore album featured more contributions from each band member. Nudo once again wrote and sang a song for the record, and although Watchorn did not write the lyrics to an entire song by himself for this album, he and Heppner collaborated on several of them, including [...] "Lady Killer". Watchorn explained that the songs changed drastically between {{the time they were}} first written and when they got recorded, and that the songs [...] "weren't complete until they actually made the record." [...] He also said that the album's protracted production history enabled the group to experiment with the songs and repeatedly alter them to taste, thus ironically yielding a record that was considered better than if they had been able to simply record it and be <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> sooner.|$|E

500|$|Initially {{struggling}} to find financial backing for Donnie Darko in Hollywood, director Richard Kelly spent {{a year and a}} half pitching the project to executives. After reading the script, Drew Barrymore agreed to finance the film through her production company Flower Films. Following Barrymore's involvement, Kelly was able to hire several well-known actors—such as Patrick Swayze, Mary McDonnell and Katharine Ross—and to produce the film for a budget of $4.5million. On January 19, 2001, Donnie Darko made its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival. Despite the film receiving considerable acclaim from critics, distributors felt daunted and were unsure of what could be <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> With its genre-bending themes and complex plot, it was described as [...] "inaccessible" [...] and [...] "not marketable". After several months it was close to going directly to home video, but was eventually picked up by Newmarket Films and received a wide release on October 26, 2001.|$|E
500|$|In 2017, Holt {{talked about}} {{recording}} the guitar solos, [...] "That's {{one of my}} favorites on the album. I'm never blown away by anything I've done musically. I always want to redo it five minutes after I'm <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> That goes down to songwriting too - it's never going to be perfect. Nothing's perfect. So yeah, I went in and did all the solos for that album in a day. I just sat down with a six pack of beer with Kerry and Terry Date. They just let me do my own thing. Tom came in after I had been messing around with a solo for a half an hour and he told me the first take was perfect. I told him they've got to let me know because I'll keep going over it and sometimes you lose a good thing when that happens. You've got to know when to just let it go and keep it whether it's raw or rough or perfect or maybe there a little bit of magic in there." ...|$|E
500|$|Retrospective {{reception}} of the Sega CD is mixed, praising certain titles in its game library but criticizing its low value for money and limitations on the benefits it provides to the Genesis. GamePro listed the Sega CD as the 7th-worst selling video game console of all time, with reviewer Blake Snow noting that [...] "The problem was threefold: the device was expensive at $299, it arrived late in the 16-bit life cycle, and it didn't do much (if anything) to enhance the gameplay experience." [...] Snow went on to note, however, that the Sega CD did have in its library [...] "the greatest Sonic game of all time" [...] in Sonic CD. IGN's Levi Buchanan criticized Sega's implementation of CD technology for the Genesis, noting, [...] "What good is the extra storage space if there is nothing inventive to be <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>it?</b> No new gameplay concepts emerged from the SEGA CD—it just offered more of the same. In fact, with few exceptions like Sonic CD, it often offered some of the 16-bit generation's worst games, like Demolition Man." [...] Jeremy Parish of USgamer pointed out that [...] "Sega was hardly the only company to muddy its waters with a CD add-on in the early '90s" [...] and highlighted some [...] "gems" [...] for the system, but cautioned [...] "the benefits offered by the Sega CD had to be balanced against {{the fact that the}} add-on more than doubled the price (and complexity) of the [...]" [...] Writing for Retro Gamer, Damien McFerran cited various reasons for the Sega CD's limited sales, including the add-on's high price, lack of significant enhancement to the Genesis console, and lack of ability to function without a console attached. Retro Gamer writer Aaron Birch, however, defended the Sega CD and wrote that [...] "the single biggest cause of the Mega-CD's failure was the console itself. When the system came out, CD-ROM technology was still in its infancy and companies had yet to get to grips with the possibilities it offered... quite simply, the Mega-CD was a console ahead of its time." ...|$|E

2500|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, some Deadheads began to sell tie-dye T-shirts, veggie burritos, or other items at Grateful Dead concerts.

During the early 1980s, the number of Deadheads taping shows increased, and the band created a special section for fans who wished to record the show.
