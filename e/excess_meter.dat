25|$|The {{mountains}} of the East-Zagros, the Kuh-i-Jupar (4135 m), Kuh-i-Lalezar (4374 m) and Kuh-i-Hezar (4469 m) do not currently have glaciers. Only at Zard Kuh and Dena some glaciers still survive. However, before the Last Glacial Period {{they had been}} glaciated to a depth in <b>excess</b> of 1900 <b>meters,</b> and during the Last Glacial Period to a depth in <b>excess</b> of 2160 <b>meters.</b> Evidence exists of a 20km wide glacier fed along a 17km long valley dropping approximately 1500 meters along its length {{on the north side}} of Kuh-i-Jupar with a thickness of 350-550m. Under precipitation conditions comparable to the current conditions, this size of glacier could be expected to form where the annual average temperature was between 10.5 and 11.2°C, but since conditions are expected to have been dryer during the period in which this glacier was formed, the temperature must have been lower.|$|R
50|$|On the {{previous}} evening, the Jaeger Battalion 5th {{had been given}} a command by Siilasvuo to go directly to Pudasjärvi, where the troops were exchanging shots with Germans. Prior to this, the Finns had proceeded in accordance with the agreed schedule followed by the Germans. Olhavalla troops were given the task to take over the intact Olhavajoen in <b>excess</b> of 45 <b>meters</b> long railway and road bridge.|$|R
50|$|Shirakawa Village and its {{surrounding}} area are a moderately inhabited area, featuring some of the heaviest snowfall found not just within mainland Japan but the whole world. Yearly average snowfall amounts average out in <b>excess</b> of 10 <b>meters</b> (415.4") with snowbanks developing well over 2 meters tall. As {{a consequence of the}} frequent heavy snow, characteristically thick thatched roofed houses are a cultural heritage of this village.|$|R
5000|$|Under Emperor Shenzong, the horse-chopping backsword, or [...] "zhanmadao", a heavy two-handed sword used by anti-cavalry {{infantry}} {{is introduced}} in the year 1072. (If Song dimensions {{are exactly the same}} as the Tang, this backsword should be slightly in <b>excess</b> of 1.2 <b>meters.)</b> This weapon is stout and massive to chop through heavy armour and continued to be in use in the Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties.|$|R
50|$|The PlayPump {{water system}} is a {{playground}} merry-go-round attached to a water pump. The spinning motion pumps underground water into a 2,500-liter tank raised seven meters above ground. The water in the tank is easily dispensed by a tap valve.

50|$|The deepest {{areas of}} the lake are, ironically, very close to shore. The eastern-most shore of Lake Kagawong {{consists}} of a sheer rocky ledge. This ledge can be as low as 1-2 meters, but rises up to 15 meters at Red Rock. The cliffs of Red Rock rise from water that is in <b>excess</b> of 40 <b>meters</b> deep. Care should be taken when boating next to these cliffs, as rockfalls are frequent.|$|R
40|$|A general {{overview}} of a conceptual {{design for a}} Microwave Radiometer Spacecraft using a large passive reflector, microwave radiometers, and advanced control concepts is presented. The mission requirements, developed around high resolution, large area mapping of soil moisture for global crop forecasting, are reviewed. These mission requirements, along with system design requirements, dictate {{the need for a}} reflector in <b>excess</b> of 700 <b>meters</b> in diameter. Conceptual designs for supporting structures and subsystems, including attitude and surface control, are summarized...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we report}} a novel {{technique}} for inexpensive {{high-speed internet access}} in buildings. Our work shows that, one can use heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) ducts for indoor wireless transmission systems and networks. Measurements and system calculations show that coverage distances in <b>excess</b> of 100 <b>meters</b> from the base station and data rates of up to 100 Mbps should be possible, when HVAC system is {{used in conjunction with}} OFDM technology...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of thermally stable graphite epoxy materials in flexure is discussed and deployment mechanism designs that are adaptable {{to both the}} proof of concept and the full scale 100 meter system with no modification to the basic concept are presented. The ground deployment test techniques and mechanisms developed for ground demonstration and evaluation of large size antenna structures are presented to illustrate the complexities involved in supporting antenna structural elements in <b>excess</b> of 25 <b>meters</b> in length...|$|R
50|$|Under the European Union legislation, VMS {{is a legal}} {{requirement}} for vessels in excess of 15 metres.By 1999, Europe had 7000 vessels, in <b>excess</b> of 15 <b>meters,</b> under VMS. Since 2005, all Community vessels automatically transmit vessel identification, date, time, position, course and speed either hourly or every 2 hours (if the responsible Fisheries Monitoring Centre can request positions). The only exception is for vessels that operate only inside home waters, and are used exclusively for aquaculture.|$|R
5000|$|The upper ocean, {{characterized}} by warm temperatures and active motion, varies in depth from 100 m {{or less in}} the tropics and eastern oceans to in <b>excess</b> of 800 <b>meters</b> in the western subtropical oceans. This layer exchanges properties such as heat and freshwater with the atmosphere on timescales of a few years. Below the mixed layer the upper ocean is generally governed by the hydrostatic and geostrophic relationships. [...] Exceptions include the deep tropics and coastal regions.|$|R

50|$|Entire {{sections}} of {{countries have been}} rendered unproductive by erosion. On the high central plateau of Madagascar, approximately ten percent of that country's land area, virtually the entire landscape is devoid of vegetation, with erosive gully furrows typically in <b>excess</b> of 50 <b>meters</b> deep and one kilometer wide. Shifting cultivation is a farming system which sometimes incorporates the slash and burn method in some regions of the world. Erosion causes loss of the fertile top soil and reduces its fertility {{and quality of the}} agricultural produce.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} address the {{shortcomings}} of the Type 88 75 mm AA Gun, the Army Technical Bureau developed a larger version with superior range, designated the Type 3. It {{was one of the}} few weapons in the Japanese inventory capable of reaching the USAAF B-29 Superfortress bombers that were attacking cities and other targets in the Japanese home islands. However, by late 1943 it became apparent that the B-29 was capable of flying at altitudes in <b>excess</b> of 10,000 <b>meters,</b> beyond the effective ceiling of the Type 3 12 cm gun.|$|R
50|$|In contrast, because {{wind power}} has been {{harnessed}} for over 100 years, its underlying technology is relatively stable. Its economics are largely determined by siting (e.g., how hard the wind blows and the grid investment requirements) and the prices of steel (the largest component of a wind turbine) and select composites (used for the blades). Because current wind turbines are often in <b>excess</b> of 100 <b>meters</b> high, logistics and a global manufacturing platform are major sources of competitive advantage. These issues and others were explored in a research report by Sanford Bernstein.|$|R
50|$|The {{diverted}} water available continuously {{can be used}} in China for {{hydroelectric power}} generation where the head drop available is in <b>excess</b> of 800 <b>meters</b> over a 40 km long stretch. This would be a joint project of China, Nepal and India for controlling river water pollution and making the Ganga river live and flowing throughout the year. With the diversion of Manasarovar lake water to Ganga basin, Lake Rakshastal would turn into a Soda lake with further increase in water salinity which is useful in abstracting the water-soluble chemicals on commercial scale.|$|R
5000|$|The {{standard}} combat ammunition mix for the M60 {{consists of}} four ball (M80) cartridges and one tracer (M62) in belts of 100 rounds. The four-to-one ratio theoretically allows the gunner to accurately [...] "walk" [...] the fire into the enemy. Tracer bullets do not fly quite the same trajectory as ball, and weapon's sights must be used for accurate fire—particularly at ranges in <b>excess</b> of 800 <b>meters,</b> where 7.62×51mm NATO tracer bullets usually burn out and are no longer visible. This {{is a problem for}} all weapons in this caliber using this tracer round.|$|R
