40|$|Interactions between {{cells and}} the {{surrounding}} matrix are critical to the development and engineering of tissues. We have investigated the role of cell-derived traction forces in the assembly of extracellular matrix using what we believe is a novel assay that allows for simultaneous measurement of traction forces and fibronectin fibril growth at discrete cell-matrix attachment sites. NIH 3 T 3 cells were plated onto arrays of deformable cantilever posts for 2 – 24 h. Data indicate that developing fibril orientation is guided by {{the direction of the}} traction force applied to that fibril. In addition, cells initially establish a spatial distribution of traction forces that is largest at the cell edge and decreases toward the cell center. This distribution progressively shifts from a predominantly peripheral pattern to a more uniform pattern as compressive strain at the cell perimeter decreases with time. The impact of these changes on fibrillogenesis was tested by treating cells with blebbistatin or calyculin A to tonically block or augment, respectively, myosin II activity. Both treatments blocked the <b>inward</b> <b>translation</b> of traction forces, the dissipation of compressive strain, and fibronectin fibrillogenesis over time. These data indicate that dynamic spatial and temporal changes in traction force and local strain may contribute to successful matrix assembly...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Linear {{acceleration}} generally {{gives rise}} to translation perception. Centripetal acceleration during centrifugation, however, has never been reported giving rise to a radial, <b>inward</b> <b>translation</b> perception. OBJECTIVE: To study whether centrifugation can induce a radial translation perception {{in the absence of}} visual cues. METHODS: To that end, we exposed 12 subjects to a centripetal acceleration with eyes closed. To avoid confounding with angular motion perception, subjects were fist rotated on-axis, and were shifted out fast and slow only after rotation sensation had vanished. They were asked for translation direction and velocity right after the shift-out, as well as after about 60 seconds of constant centrifugation. RESULTS: Independent of fast or slow shift-out, the vast statistically significant majority of trials yielded an inward radial translation perception, which velocity was constant after 60 seconds of constant centrifugation. CONCLUSIONS: We therefore conclude that during centrifugation, an inward radial translation perception does exist in humans, which perception reaches a constant, non-zero value during constant rotation, lasting for at least one minute. These results can be understood by high-pass filtering of otolith afferents to make a distinction between inertial and gravitational acceleration, followed by a mere integration over time to reach a constant velocity perception...|$|E

40|$|The morphologic {{transition}} from complex impact craters, to peak-ring basins, and to multi-ring basins has been well-documented for decades. Less clear {{has been the}} morphometric characteristics of these landforms due to their large size {{and the lack of}} global high-resolution topography data. We use data from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) instrument onboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft to derive the morphometric characteristics of impact basins on the Moon, assess the trends, and interpret the processes involved in the observed morphologic transitions. We first developed a new technique for measuring and calculating the geometric/morphometric properties of impact basins on the Moon. This new method meets a number of criteria that are important for consideration in any topographic analysis of crater landforms (e. g., multiple data points, complete range of azimuths, systematic, reproducible analysis techniques, avoiding effects of post-event processes, robustness with respect to the statistical techniques). The resulting data more completely capture the azimuthal variation in topography that is characteristic of large impact structures. These new calculations extend the well-defined geometric trends for simple and complex craters out to basin-sized structures. Several new geometric trends for peak-ring basins are observed. Basin depth: A factor of two reduction in the depth to diameter (d/Dr) ratio in the {{transition from}} complex craters to peak-ring basins may be characterized by a steeper trend than known previously. The d/Dr ratio for peak-ring basins decreases with rim-crest diameter, which may be due to a non-proportional change in excavation cavity growth or scaling, as may occur in the simple to complex transition, or increased magnitude of floor uplift associated with peak-ring formation. Wall height, width, and slope: Wall height and width increase with increasing rim-crest diameter, while wall slope decreases; decreasing ratios of wall width to radius and wall height to depth may reflect burial of wall slump block toes by impact melt redistribution during transient cavity collapse. Melt expulsion from the central basin may help to explain the observed increase in floor height to depth ratio; such central depressions are seen within the largest peak-ring basins. Peak-ring height: Heights of peak rings increase with increasing rim-crest diameter (similar to central peak heights in complex craters); peak-ring height to basin depth ratio also increases, suggesting that floor uplift is even larger in magnitude in the largest peak-ring basins. No correlation is found between peak-ring elevation and distance to the rim wall within a single basin, suggesting that rim-wall slumping does not control the topography of peak rings. Offset of peak rings: Peak rings often show minor offset from the basin center. Enhancement in peak-ring elevation in the direction of offset is generally not observed, although this could be a function of magnitude of offset. Basin volume: Volumes of peak-ring basins are about 40 % smaller than the volumes predicted by geophysical estimates of the dimensions of corresponding excavation cavities. This difference indicates that collapse of the transient cavity must result in large <b>inward</b> and upward <b>translations</b> of the cavity floor. These new observations of geometric/morphometric properties of protobasins and peak-ring basins place some constraints on the processes controlling the onset and formation of interior landforms in peak-ring basins. Comparisons of the geometric trends of the inner rings of Orientale basin with those of peak-ring basins are generally consistent with a mega-terrace model for the formation of multi-ring basins.
