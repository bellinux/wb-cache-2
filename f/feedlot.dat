25|$|Some cattle {{may also}} be {{so-called}} “super-shedders” of the bacterium. Super-shedders may be defined as cattle exhibiting rectoanal junction colonization and excreting >103 to 4 CFU g−1 feces.

A majority with a one-time feeding capacity of more than 10, 000 head were using a microcomputer record-keeping system, whereas most of those with fewer than 10, 000 head used a manual, paper-based system. Those <b>feedlots</b> using computerized record-keeping systems had purchased their software package from one of five companies. Managers felt these software packages were adequate for billing customers, monitoring pharmaceutical inventory and withdrawal period, and aiding treatment diagnosis. Proper monitoring of animal inventory was indicated by some <b>feedlots</b> as a limitation of their particular software. Almost all <b>feedlots</b> using computer record-keeping systems indicated that fewer than five employees operate the system on a regular basis.

25|$|Beef is {{the culinary}} name for meat from cattle, {{particularly}} skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times. Beef {{is a source}} of high-quality protein and essential nutrients. Depending on economics, the number of heifers kept for breeding varies. The meat from older bulls is usually tougher, so it is frequently used for mince (known as ground beef in the United States). Cattle raised for beef may be allowed to roam free on grasslands, or may be confined at some stage in pens as part of a large feeding operation called a <b>feedlot</b> (or concentrated animal feeding operation), where they are usually fed a ration of grain, protein, roughage and a vitamin/mineral preblend.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{analysis}} and description of pollution {{problems caused by}} large <b>feedlots</b> in Utah. A description of pollution caused by cattle <b>feedlots</b> is undertaken {{as part of the}} study. The 26 <b>feedlots</b> analyzed had a capacity to/or did feed over 1, 000 head. They were broken down into four groups {{on the basis of their}} pollution problems: those having no apparent pollution problem, those having minor problems, those having major problems, and those requiring relocation. The cost impact of meeting environmental standards with regard to runoff control was found to be very slight for the cattle feeding industry as a whole - only 18 cents per head fed on the average. The <b>feedlots</b> with minor problems averaged costs of slightly over 2 cents per head fed. The <b>feedlots</b> with major problems averaged costs of almost 5 cents per head fed using the least cost method of natural evaporation ponds and mechanical disposal systems.

25|$|Animals {{that feed}} on grain or rely on grazing require more water than grain crops. Producing 1kg of meat {{requires}} up to 15,000 liters of water. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), growing crops for farm animals requires {{nearly half of}} the US water supply and 80% of its agricultural land. Animals raised for food in the US consume 90% of the soy crop, 80% of the corn crop, and 70% of its grain. However, where an extensive farming system (as opposed to a <b>feedlot)</b> is used, some water and nutrients are returned to the soil to provide a benefit to the pasture. This cycling and processing of water and nutrients is less prevalent in most plant production systems, so may bring the efficiency rate of animal production closer to the efficiency of plant based agricultural systems. In tracking food animal production from the feed through to the dinner table, the inefficiencies of meat, milk, and egg production range from a 4:1 energy input to protein output ratio up to 54:1. The result is that producing animal-based food is typically much less efficient than the harvesting of grains, vegetables, legumes, seeds, and fruits.|$|E

2500|$|One of the cited changes {{suggested}} to reduce {{greenhouse gas emissions}} is intensification of the livestock industry, since intensification leads to less land for a given level of production. This assertion is supported by studies of the US beef production system, suggesting practices prevailing in 2007 involved 8.6% less fossil fuel use, 16.3% less greenhouse gas emissions, 12.1% less water use, and 33.0% less land use, per unit mass of beef produced, than those used in 1977. [...] The analysis took into account not only practices in feedlots, but also feed production (with less feed needed in more intensive production systems), forage-based cow-calf operations and back-grounding before cattle enter a <b>feedlot</b> (with more beef produced per head of cattle from those sources, in more intensive systems), and beef from animals derived from the dairy industry.|$|E
2500|$|The {{industrial}} agriculture system consumes fossil fuel, water, and topsoil at unsustainable rates. It contributes to numerous forms of environmental degradation, including {{air and water}} pollution, soil depletion, diminishing biodiversity, and fish die-offs. Meat production contributes disproportionately to these problems, in part because feeding grain to livestock to produce meat—instead of feeding it directly to humans—involves a large energy loss, making animal agriculture more resource intensive than other forms of food production. ... One personal act that can have {{a profound impact on}} these issues is reducing meat consumption. To produce 1 pound of <b>feedlot</b> beef requires about 2,400 gallons of water and 7 pounds of grain (42). Considering that the average American consumes 97 pounds of beef (and 273 pounds of meat in all) each year, even modest reductions in meat consumption in such a culture would substantially reduce the burden on our natural resources.|$|E
