5|$|The {{land that}} Van Cortlandt Park now {{occupies}} {{was purchased by}} Jacobus Van Cortlandt from John Barrett around 1691. His son Frederick built the Van Cortlandt House on the property, but died before its completion. Later, the land was used during the Revolutionary War when the Stockbridge militia was destroyed by the Queen's Rangers. In 1888, the family property was sold to the City of New York and made <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> parkland. The Van Cortlandt House, which would later be designated as a historic landmark, was converted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> museum, and new paths were created across the property {{to make it more}} passable.|$|E

5|$|In , the {{caretaker}} government approved plans to turn Biman <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> limited company with shareholdings split between seven public sector organisations. As {{a part of}} the restructuring, the government put in place a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) to reduce the man-equipment ratio (MER) of 367:1 (ratio of manpower to aircraft). The industry average at the time was 200:1, and other Asian airlines operated with MERs of about 150:1. The VRS provided compensation based on length of service, at a cost to the government of over BDT2.97billion borrowed from the World Bank. Biman management expected to reduce its workforce by 1,600, but 2,162applications were received, many from employees who expected to be dismissed with little or no severance pay if the quota was not met. Biman accepted between 1,863 and 1877 applications, and affirmed that key personnel {{would not be allowed to}} leave the organisation via VRS.|$|E

5|$|The Cavendish family {{sold the}} abbey in 1733, at which point, with Cavendish House in ruins, the precinct {{was being used}} as {{agricultural}} land. By the 19th century the abbey {{had come into the}} possession of the Earls of Dysart. Lionel Tollemache, 8th Earl of Dysart, sold the land east of the River Soar (known as Abbey Meadows) in 1876; this was to allow Leicester Town Council to undertake flood prevention work.

5|$|The {{east end}} of the Cleveland Railway, from Loftus to Brotton plus the {{connection}} to the Tees Valley Line west of Saltburn, is still in use as a mineral railway serving Boulby Mine.

It is now a public footpath, the South Bank Walkway, which links Flatts Lane Country Park to South Bank. The middle section of the line from Normanby to Guisborough is in private ownership or has been built on, though the former railway's embankment can still be clearly seen running alongside the A171 Middlesbrough Road.

5|$|There {{are three}} {{government}} columbaria and 57 private ones. The government-operated columbaria are at Mandai, Yishun and Choa Chu Kang. (A fourth government columbarium at Mount Vernon {{is due to}} close at an unspecified date due to redevelopment of its surrounding area <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> housing estate.) Private columbaria are operated by the Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery, the Roman Catholic Church of Saint Mary of the Angels in Bukit Batok, and the Singapore Soka Association, among others. As with crematoria, {{there is a significant}} price difference between niches in private and government columbaria. A standard niche in any government columbarium costs less than $900, but one at the Kong Meng San monastery costs more than $15,000. The government columbaria allocate niches sequentially, and charge an extra $250 for any location change request; for an extra price, the private columbaria allow families to choose niche locations subject to availability, and even to pre-book niches before death.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Red Letter Day, Dewees became a {{full-time}} member as the band began recording their second studio album in Los Angeles in June 1999 with producer Alex Brahl. Before the album went into production, Vagrant Records co-owner John Cohen borrowed money from his parents, who had mortgaged their house in order to fund {{the production of the}} album. On September 21, 1999, the band released Something to Write Home About on Vagrant Records. The album's lyrics reflected the record label strife the band had experienced and their distance between friends and family back home after their move to Los Angeles. Something to Write Home About has been singled out as the band's only 'true' emo album, as the album's aesthetic fit more into the contemporary definition of the genre. Furthermore, the album single-handedly turned the struggling Vagrant label into one of the top indie labels in the country, selling over 140,000 copies after its release. Not only did the album make The Get Up Kids the poster children for emo, but it also launched the genre <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> consciousness broader than the scattered local scenes that had previously embraced it. The album gave Vagrant Records the financial backing to grow and sign a string of other bands. At the same time, the addition of keyboards alienated some fans who thought it moved the band away from the contemporary punk scene's DIY ethic.|$|E
5|$|As Antoine {{decided to}} model Antoinist {{holidays}} on Catholicism, followers celebrate Christian holidays, including All Saints, Christmas, Easter, Easter Monday and Ascension; these days, appropriate portions of Antoine's works are read during the services. There are also three special days in Antoinism, and attendance at worship is generally higher at these moments: (1) 25 June, the Father's Day. It {{was established by}} Antoine's wife shortly after his death. At first, from 1913, all the temples except the one in Jemeppe were closed {{that day in the}} purpose that followers came to attend the ceremony in that city. So many Antoinists performed a pilgrimage to Jemeppe-sur-Meuse to participate in a procession through the city which outlined the main events of Antoine's life. The procession was withdrawn in 1937 and the pilgrimage seems to be no longer organized. That day, the faithful pay homage to the founder in the temples. (2) 15 August, the consecration of the temple's Day, which commemorates the consecration of the first temple. In 1911, on that day, the General Operation took place at the temple, then the ceremony continued <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> hall, which shocked followers; therefore, the following year, the whole ceremony took place exclusively in the temple. (3) 3 November, the Mother's Day, as anniversary of Catherine's death.|$|E

5|$|Cromwell {{did much}} work through his many offices {{to remove the}} tasks of {{government}} from the Royal Household (and ideologically from the personal body of the King) and <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> state. He did so, however, in a haphazard fashion that left several remnants, not least because he needed to retain Henry's support, his own power, {{and the possibility of}} actually achieving the plan he set out. Cromwell made the various income streams put in place by Henry VII more formal and assigned largely autonomous bodies for their administration. The role of the King's Council was transferred to a reformed Privy Council, much smaller and more efficient than its predecessor. A difference emerged between the financial health of the king, and that of the country, although Cromwell's fall undermined much of his bureaucracy, which required his hand to keep order among the many new bodies and prevent profligate spending that strained relations as well as finances. Cromwell's reforms ground to a halt in 1539, the initiative lost, and he failed to secure the passage of an enabling act, the Proclamation by the Crown Act 1539. He too was executed, on 28 July 1540.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the closure}} of the Great Exhibition in October 1851, Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace was bought and moved to Penge Place atop Sydenham Hill, South London by the newly formed Crystal Palace Company. The grounds that {{surrounded}} it were then extensively renovated and turned <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> park with ornamental gardens, replicas of statues and two new man-made lakes. As part of this renovation, Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins was commissioned to build the first-ever life-sized models of extinct animals. He had originally planned to just re-create extinct mammals before deciding on building dinosaurs as well, which he did with advice from Sir Richard Owen, a celebrated biologist and palaeontologist of the time. Hawkins set up a workshop on site at the park and built the models there. The models were displayed on three islands acting as a rough timeline, the first island for the Paleozoic era, a second for the Mesozoic, and a third for the Cenozoic. The models were given more realism by making the water level in the lake rise and fall, revealing different amounts of the dinosaurs. To mark the launch of the models, Hawkins held a dinner on New Year's Eve 1853 inside the mould of one of the Iguanodon models.|$|E
5|$|Four Fokker F27s {{joined the}} fleet in 1973, {{enabling}} Biman {{to double the}} frequency of the Kolkata flight to a twice daily service. A Boeing 707 was added to the fleet in September and the flight to London became twice-weekly, while a Chittagong–Kolkata flight also began operating. In 1974, operations were extended to Kathmandu (February), Bangkok (November) and Dubai (December). In 1976, Biman sold two of its Fokker F27s and bought another Boeing 707 to extend international services to Abu Dhabi, Karachi and Mumbai. Singapore was added to Biman's list of international destinations, when a third Boeing 707 was purchased in February 1977, followed by Jeddah, Doha and Amsterdam the following year, which also saw the purchase of its fourth Boeing 707. In 1977, Biman was converted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> sector corporation to be governed by a board of directors appointed by the government. The airline broke even {{for the first time in}} 1977–78, and made a profit the following year. International destinations expanded to include Kuala Lumpur, Athens, Muscat and Tripoli in 1979, followed by Yangon, Tokyo and Dhahran in 1980. Biman took delivery of its first 85-seater Fokker F28-4000 in 1981. In 1983, three Douglas DC-10s joined the fleet and the airline started to phase out the Boeing 707s. The flight network expanded further to include Baghdad (1983), Paris (1984) and Bahrain (1986). On 5 August 1984, Biman faced its worst accident ever when a Fokker F27 flying in from Chittagong crashed near Dhaka, killing all 49 on board. The long haul fleet was then supplemented by the purchase of two new Airbus A310s in 1996, followed by the addition of two more in 2000, from Singapore Airlines and Air Jamaica, and another in 2003.|$|E
