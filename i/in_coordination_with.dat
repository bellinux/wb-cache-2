5|$|Anderitum {{appears to}} have been a {{particularly}} important link in the Saxon Shore forts, which extended from Hampshire to Norfolk and may have been connected by intermediate watchtowers. The Notitia Dignitatum mentions a fleet that was presumably based there, the Classis Anderidaensis. It would probably have acted <b>in</b> <b>coordination</b> <b>with</b> naval units based on the other side of the Channel to intercept pirate ships passing through the Channel. Like the other Saxon Shore forts, Anderitum's position at a strategic harbour would have enabled the Romans to control access to the shoreline and prevent invaders from penetrating inland. It was linked by a road built in the late Roman period, probably at the same time as the fort.|$|E

Initial trials carried out with active Sea Kings found several advantages to the BERP rotor, including a longer fatigue life and improved aerodynamic characteristics. Subsequent Westland helicopters, such as the record-breaking Lynx and the AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin, took advantage of BERP rotors for greater performance. Westland equipped later-built Sea Kings with the new composite rotors as well.|$|E
5|$|On August 5, the KPA's 12th Division {{pushed back}} the ROK Capital Division in the Ch'ongsong-Kigye area, and linked up with {{elements}} of the 766th which had infiltrated the area of Pohyunsan.

The Regiment was ordered to begin an attack <b>in</b> <b>coordination</b> <b>with</b> the KPA's 5th Division. The Korean People's Army planned simultaneous offensives across the entire Perimeter, including a flanking maneuver by the 766th and the 5th Division to envelop UN troops and push them back to Pusan.

5|$|Articles 41–43 mandate the State to {{endeavour}} to secure to all citizens the right to work, a living wage, social security, maternity relief, and a decent standard of living. These provisions aim at establishing a socialist state as envisaged in the Preamble. Article 43 also places upon the State the responsibility of promoting cottage industries, {{and the federal government}} has, in furtherance of this, established several Boards for the promotion of khadi, handlooms etc., <b>in</b> <b>coordination</b> <b>with</b> the state governments. Article 39A requires the State to provide free legal aid to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are available to all citizens irrespective of economic or other disabilities. Article 43A mandates the State to work towards securing the participation of workers in the management of industries. The State, under Article 46, is also mandated to promote the interests of and work for the economic uplift of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and protect them from discrimination and exploitation.

Members of the Cabinet of Burma donated 3.7million kyat (US$2,960) in cash and 140bags of rice to victims in the Ayeyarwady Region. On May3, another 1.7million kyat (US$1,360) was donated by social organizations to residents in rural areas outside Yangon. Temporary shelters were set up across Gwa Township. Local donations provided residents in the town with 200,000kyat (US$160) worth of blankets, clothes, and cash. A local newspaper, The New Light of Myanmar, claimed that government officials immediately provided assistance to affected residents across the country. Red Cross operations continued through November30, by which time 3,485families were provided with aid. Additionally, though the agency planned to assist 4,000families with rebuilding their homes, a lack of necessary funds prevented the operation. Instead, a cash donation was provided to the 1,000most affected families.|$|E
40|$|Lecture on {{the first}} SFB/TR 15 meeting, Gummersbach, July, 18 - 20, 2004 : This paper explores {{predictability}} of behavior <b>in</b> <b>coordination</b> games <b>with</b> multiple equilibria. In a laboratory experiment we measure subjects' certainty equivalents for three coordination games and one lottery. Attitudes towards strategic uncertainty <b>in</b> <b>coordination</b> games are related to risk aversion, experience seeking, gender and age. From the distribution of certainty equivalents among participating students we estimate probabilities for successful <b>coordination</b> <b>in</b> {{a wide range of}} coordination games. For many games success of <b>coordination</b> is predictable <b>with</b> a reasonable error rate. The best response of a risk neutral player is close to the global-game solution. Comparing choices <b>in</b> <b>coordination</b> games <b>with</b> revealed risk aversion, we estimate subjective probabilities for successful <b>coordination.</b> <b>In</b> games <b>with</b> a low <b>coordination</b> requirement, most subjects underestimate the probability of success. In games <b>with</b> a high <b>coordination</b> requirement, most subjects overestimate this probability. Data indicate that subjects have probabilistic beliefs about success or failure of coordination rather than beliefs about individual behavior of other players...|$|R
