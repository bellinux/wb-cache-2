5|$|The city's growing Latino {{population}} has <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> {{to a number}} of local and regional Spanish language newspapers. These include El Planeta (owned by the former publisher of The Boston Phoenix), El Mundo, and La Semana. Siglo21, with its main offices in nearby Lawrence, is also widely distributed.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the years, {{the unusual}} {{nature of the}} House with Chimaeras has <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> {{to a number of}} stories {{occasionally}} repeated in guide-books or newspapers, which are however either untrue or lacking any verifiable source.|$|E
5|$|A Polish Nobleman is a 1637 {{painting}} by Rembrandt depicting {{a man in}} a costume of either Polish szlachta or boyar nobility. The identity of the subject of the painting is unclear, and has <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> to several different interpretations. The view that the figure's dress is clearly Polish is not universally held and {{it may have been a}} self-portrait.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ancestors}} of Monogenea were probably free-living flatworms similar to modern Turbellaria.According {{to the more}} widely accepted view, [...] "rhabdocoel turbellarians <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to monogeneans; these, in turn, <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to digeneans, from which the cestodes were derived. Another {{view is that the}} rhabdocoel ancestor <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to two lines; one <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to monogeneans, who <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to digeneans, and the other line <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to cestodes" [...] 1 [...]|$|R
50|$|Due {{to their}} faith, they will {{experience}} feelings {{as a result}} of repeated contact through the six sense bases. In them feeling <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> to craving; craving <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> to clinging; clinging <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> to current existence (upapatti bhava) and the kammic causal process (kamma bhava); the kammic causal process <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> to rebirth; and rebirth <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> to ageing, death, grief, lamentation, pain, distress and despair.|$|R
50|$|The AB lineage <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> to neurons, skin, and pharynx. The P1 cell divides into EMS and P2. The EMS cell divides into MS and E. The MS lineage <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> to pharynx, muscle, and neurons. The E lineage <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> to intestines. The P2 cell divides into P3 and C founder cells. The C founder cells <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> {{to muscle}}, skin, and neurons. The P3 cell divides into P4 and D founder cells. The D founder cells <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> to muscle while the P4 lineage <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> to the germ line.|$|R
5|$|Both sexes are {{territorial}} on {{the breeding}} grounds, with distinctive threat displays, but are more gregarious during migration and in wintering areas. Pairs {{stay in their}} territory throughout the year where the climate is sufficiently temperate. This common and conspicuous species has <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> {{to a number of}} literary and cultural references, frequently related to its song.|$|E
5|$|In July 1943, a plane {{carrying}} Sikorski {{plunged into}} the sea immediately after takeoff from Gibraltar, killing all on board except the pilot. The exact circumstances of Sikorski's death have been disputed and have <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> {{to a number of}} different theories surrounding the crash and his death. Sikorski had been the most prestigious leader of the Polish exiles, and his death was a severe setback for the Polish cause.|$|E
5|$|In later centuries Narihira {{has been}} {{considered}} the epitome of the amorous bel homme, and his romantic escapades have <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> to many later legends. He and his contemporary Ono no Komachi were considered the archetypes of the beautiful man and woman of the Heian court, and appear as such in many later literary works, particularly in Noh theatre.|$|E
50|$|The Mandaloceratidae {{are derived}} from the Reudemannoceratidae through Madiganella. The {{earliest}} mandeloceratid is Pseudogomphoceras which <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to Ovocerina. Ovocerina <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to Cinctoceras, Umbeloceras, Verspoeras, and Mandaloceras. It also <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to the Mesoceratidae representing Mesoceras.|$|R
50|$|Synergy is caudo-caudal. The gametocysts are 70 µm × 55 µm and <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> to {{multiple}} gametes. After fertilization the zygote <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> to ~20 sporocysts. There is no residual body. The sporocysts are bivalved and <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> {{to multiple}} sporozoites.|$|R

5|$|In recent years, Belgrade {{has also}} <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> to several {{world-class}} tennis {{players such as}} Ana Ivanović, Jelena Janković and Novak Đoković. Ivanović and Đoković are the first female and male Belgraders, respectively, to win Grand Slam singles titles and been ATP number 1 with Jelena Janković. The Serbian national team won the 2010 Davis Cup, beating the French team in the finals played in the Belgrade Arena.|$|E
5|$|Ottoman cuisine has <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> to the cuisines {{of modern}} Turkey, {{parts of the}} Balkans, Cyprus, and Greece. A {{distinctive}} element is the family of small flaky pastries called börek. These are popular and widespread across the Eastern Mediterranean region, and date {{as far back as}} ancient Roman times. Börek are made of thin sheets of filo pastry, filled with mixtures such as meat, caramelised onion and sweet peppers.|$|E
5|$|Well-explored deposits, {{potentially}} classifiable as reserves, {{include the}} Green River deposits {{in the western}} United States, the Tertiary deposits in Queensland, Australia, deposits in Sweden and Estonia, the El-Lajjun deposit in Jordan, and deposits in France, Germany, Brazil, China, southern Mongolia and Russia. These deposits have <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> to expectations of yielding at least 40liters of shale oil per tonne of oil shale, using the Fischer Assay.|$|E
50|$|In males, the UG sinus {{is divided}} into three regions: upper, pelvic, and phallic. The upper part <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> to the urinary bladder and the pelvic part <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> to the prostatic and {{membranous}} parts of the urethra. The phallic portion <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> to the penile urethra.|$|R
50|$|The {{addition}} of 6-thioguanine <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to the DAT regimen, and the {{addition of}} 6-mercaptopurine <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to the DAM regimen.|$|R
50|$|Aulatornoceras, type for the Aulatornoceratinae was {{previously}} considered a subgenus of Tornoceras {{and is known}} from the Upper Devonian of North America and Europe. Aulatornoceras <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to Truyolsoceras and Polonoceras, which <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to Armatites, Kirsoceras, and Pernoceras, which <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to Pseudoclymenia making up the Aulotornoceratidae.|$|R
5|$|Carroll Baker {{was born}} and raised in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, in a Roman Catholic family, the {{daughter}} of Edith Gertrude (née Duffy) and William Watson Baker, who was a traveling salesman. She is of Polish descent, which has <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> to a rumor that her birth name was Karolina Piekarski. However, this currently cannot be substantiated by known records. Baker's parents separated when she was eight years old, and she moved with her mother and younger sister, Virginia, to Turtle Creek, Pennsylvania. According to Baker, her mother struggled as a single parent, and the family was poor for much of her upbringing.|$|E
5|$|Contact between English and {{immigrant}} languages has <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> to new accents and dialects. For instance, {{the variety of}} English spoken by Poles in Manchester is distinct both from typical Polish-accented English and from Mancunian. At a local level, the diversity of immigrant communities means that some languages that are extremely rare in {{the country as a}} whole have strongholds in Northern towns: Pashto is spoken natively by 0.08% of the population of England but 0.7% of the population of Bradford, while Cantonese is the first language of 0.4% of the population of Manchester compared to 0.08% nationally.|$|E
5|$|From its {{beginnings}} in the 1930s, ski flying has developed its own distinct history and <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> {{to all of}} the sport's world records. The first hill designed specifically for ski flying was built in Slovenia in 1934, after which both Germany and Austria built their own hills in 1950. This was followed by Norway in 1966, the United States in 1970, and the Czech Republic in 1980. From the 1960s to 1980s, a friendly rivalry between the European venues saw world records being set regularly, together with hill upgrades and evolutions in technique to fly longer distances.|$|E
50|$|Protophragmoceras <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to the Middle Silurian Phragmoceras, which <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to the {{closely related}} Middle Silurian Tubiferoceras {{and to the}} Upper Silurian Pristeroceras and Phragmocerina. Protophagmoceras also <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to the less {{characteristic}} but still included Middle Silurian Endoplectoceras and Sthenoceras, which extends into the Lower Devonian.|$|R
50|$|Because each nucleus {{contains}} {{a large population}} of neurons, the dorsal column nuclei <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> to characteristic bumps or tubercles when viewing the posterior side of the intact brainstem. In particular, the cuneate nucleus <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> to the cuneate tubercle, while the gracile nucleus <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> to the gracile tubercle.|$|R
5000|$|Strandoceras <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to the Phragmoceratidae {{and very}} likely to Kiaeroceras and Cyrtogomphoceras, which in turn <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to Landeroceras, within the Cyrtogomphoceratidae ...|$|R
5|$|In 1876, Frederick Law Olmsted {{was hired}} to survey the Bronx and map out streets based on the local geography. Olmsted noted {{the natural beauty of}} the Van Cortlandt estate, {{comparing}} it to Central Park which he designed, and recommended the city purchase the property. The land was part of a proposed greenbelt across the Bronx, consisting of parks and parkways that would align more with existing geography than a grid system similar to the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 in Manhattan. That grid had <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> to Central Park, a park with mostly artificial features within the bounds of the grid. However, in 1877, the city declined to act upon his plan.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the American ornithologist Dean Amadon {{suggested}} that Sturnus-like species could have arrived in Africa, and <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> to the wattled starling (Creatophora cinerea) and the Mascarene starlings. According to Amadon, the Rodrigues and hoopoe starlings {{were related to}} Asiatic starlings, such as some species of Sturnus, rather than the glossy starlings (Lamprotornis) of Africa and the Madagascan starling (Saroglossa aurata); he concluded this based on the colouration of the birds. A 2008 study, which analysed the DNA of various starlings, confirmed that the hoopoe starling was a starling, but with no close relatives among the sampled species.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs lack any shared {{traits that}} make them stand out from all other primates. Different types of lemurs have evolved unique {{combinations}} of unusual traits to cope with Madagascar's harsh, seasonal climate. These traits can include seasonal fat storage, hypometabolism (including torpor and hibernation), small group sizes, low encephalization (relative brain size), cathemerality (activity both day and night), and strict breeding seasons. Extreme resource limitations and seasonal breeding are also thought to have <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> to three other relatively common lemur traits: female social dominance, sexual monomorphism, and male–male competition for mates involving low levels of agonism, such as sperm competition.|$|E
5000|$|Measles {{may cause}} {{auditory}} nerve damage but usually <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> to a chronic middle ear problem <b>giving</b> <b>rise</b> to a mixed hearing loss.|$|R
50|$|Assuming this {{is correct}} the {{evolutionary}} order appears to be: the Archigregarinorida <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to the Eugregarinorida {{who in turn}} <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to the Neogregarinorida.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{statement of}} Huygens' principle for the D'Alembertian <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> to the KdV hierarchy, analogously, the Dirac operator <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> to the AKNS hierarchy.|$|R
5|$|Palaeobotanists study ancient {{plants in}} the fossil record to provide {{information}} about the evolutionary history of plants. Cyanobacteria, the first oxygen-releasing photosynthetic organisms on Earth, are thought to have <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> to the ancestor of plants by entering into an endosymbiotic relationship with an early eukaryote, ultimately becoming the chloroplasts in plant cells. The new photosynthetic plants (along with their algal relatives) accelerated the rise in atmospheric oxygen started by the cyanobacteria, changing the ancient oxygen-free, reducing, atmosphere to one in which free oxygen has been abundant for more than 2 billion years.|$|E
5|$|Psittacosaurus {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} ceratopsians, but closer to Triceratops than Yinlong. Once in its own family, Psittacosauridae, with other genera like Hongshanosaurus, it is now considered to be senior synonym of the latter and an early offshoot of the branch that led to more derived forms. The genera closely related to Psittacosaurus are all from Asia, with the exception of Aquilops, from North America. The first species was either P. lujiatunensis or closely related, and it may have <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> to later forms of Psittacosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Roger of Hoveden {{described}} Uhtred of Galloway as a consanguinus ("cousin") of King Henry II of England, {{an assertion}} that has <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> {{to the theory}} that, since Gille-Brighde is never described as such, {{they must have been}} from different mothers. Fergus must therefore, according to the theory, have had two wives, one of whom was a bastard daughter of Henry I; that is, Uhtred and his descendants were related to the English royal family, while Gille-Brighde and his descendants were not. According to historian G.W.S. Barrow, the theory is disproved by one English royal document, written in the name of King John of England, which likewise asserts that Donnchadh was John's cousin.|$|E
50|$|According to Donovan et al (1981) the Stephanoceratidae and Otoitdae {{both have}} their {{origin in the}} Hildoceratoidea, in the Phymatoceratidae. The Otoitidae <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to the Sphaeroceratidae which <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to the Cardioceraticae, the Stephanoceratidae to the Kosmoceratidae, all within the Stephanoceratoidea. The Stephanoceratidae, accordingly, also <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to the Perisphinctidae, root stock of the Perisphictoidea.|$|R
50|$|The Phylloceratina is {{the ancestral}} stock, {{derived from the}} Ceratitida {{near the end of}} the Triassic. The Phylloceratina <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to the Lytoceratina near the {{beginning}} of the Jurassic which in turn <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to the highly specialized Ancyloceratina {{near the end of the}} Jurassic. Both the Phylloceratina and Lytoceratina <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to various stocks combined in the Ammonitina.|$|R
