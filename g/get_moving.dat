5|$|On {{the morning}} of 8 December, Ottoman {{artillery}} began firing on a road junction, which Mott's Detachment had to negotiate. Unable to advance or retaliate against the accurate shell fire from an Ottoman battery near Bethlehem, the detachment waited. At around noon, Chetwode, the corps' commander, ordered the detachment to <b>get</b> <b>moving.</b> Mott finally attacked his main objective at Beit Jala at 16:00, but the Ottoman Army had already retired. It {{was not until the}} evening that they continued their advanced to find the way completely clear of Ottoman defenders. At the crucial moment, Mott's Detachment was unable to cover the southern flank of the 60th (London) Division, forcing the Londoners to pause during daylight, as enfilading fire would have made any advance extremely costly.|$|E
5|$|The 1993 Independence Bowl {{kicked off}} on December 31, 1993 in Shreveport, Louisiana. Indiana jumped {{out to an}} early lead {{courtesy}} of a 75-yard pass from quarterback John Paci. Virginia Tech equalized the score before the first quarter ran out, then took a 14–7 lead with a second-quarter touchdown run by fullback Joe Swarm. Indiana climbed back with two field goals that cut Tech's lead to 14–13. With Indiana in possession of the ball and time running down, it appeared that Indiana would {{have at least one}} more attempt on offense before halftime. Before the Indiana drive could <b>get</b> <b>moving,</b> John Paci fumbled the ball, which was recovered by Virginia Tech and returned 20yards for a touchdown. On Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff, Indiana returned the ball deep into Virginia Tech territory, setting up a potential field goal by kicker Bill Manolopoulos. During the kick, Virginia Tech defender Jeff Holland broke through the Indiana offensive line and blocked the field goal attempt. Tech's Antonio Banks scooped up the ball and ran 80yards for another touchdown—Virginia Tech's second in less than 40seconds.|$|E

25|$|Once an Accident, Out of Gas, or Flat Tire hazard {{has been}} played, and the {{appropriate}} remedy card played to correct it, the player must next play a Roll card in order to <b>get</b> <b>moving</b> again. A hazard can be played onto an opponent's battle area even if another one is already showing, but only the topmost hazard needs to be corrected before that player can use a Roll card. Playing a Roll against a Stop hazard corrects it and allows the player to start moving; a second Roll is not needed.|$|E

25|$|At this point, the Broncos offense {{finally managed}} to <b>get</b> <b>moving,</b> picking up a first down {{for the first time}} in the game at 10:37 and moving the ball to the Seattle 35-yard line. But on third-and-13, Manning was hit by Seahawks {{defensive}} end Cliff Avril as he tried to throw a pass to Moreno, causing a high short floater that was intercepted by linebacker Malcolm Smith and returned 69 yards for a touchdown. After Seattle's kickoff, Denver mounted a drive to the Seahawks' 19-yard line, aided by Demaryius Thomas's 19-yard reception on third-and-5. With just over a minute left in the half, Denver faced fourth-and-2. Rather than kick a field goal, they tried to pick up a first down, but Manning's pass was incomplete and the score would remain 22–0 at the end of the half. The 22-point deficit was the largest faced by the Broncos all season. It was also the third-largest halftime deficit in Super Bowl history, and the previous two were also against the Broncos – the Redskins led the Broncos 35–10 in Super Bowl XXII and the 49ers led the Broncos 27–3 in Super Bowl XXIV.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of 7 November 1976, three insurgents {{from a group of}} seven were spotted by an Army observation post in the Mutema Tribal Trust Lands, just south-west of Birchenough Bridge in Manicaland province. Fireforce was called up and the Rhodesians readied themselves to fly out by helicopter and engage the guerrillas. There were eight four-man [...] "stops" [...] involved in a Fireforce, and on this occasion Lamb headed Stop 2. Just before they left, Lamb ran over to Lance-Corporal Phil Kaye, the leader of Stop 3, and shouted over the noise of the aircraft.

[...] Kaye and his MAG gunner, Trooper Pat Grogan, waved away this comment and told Lamb to <b>get</b> <b>moving.</b> [...] "Go nail gooks!" [...] Kaye called after Lamb as he and the rest of Stop 2 took off aboard their Alouette III gunship. Lamb's men were an 18-year-old national service MAG gunner of Portuguese-Rhodesian extraction named Trooper Soares; Trooper Cornelius Olivier, a 20-year-old Rhodesian regular who carried an FN FAL battle rifle; and Trooper Tony Rok, an Australian Vietnam veteran, aged 28 and also equipped with an FN. Lamb carried the stick's radio on his back with his FN FAL ready in his hands.|$|E

He noted that while the episode had a slow start, [...] "the script ... doesn't <b>get</b> <b>moving</b> until the bus gets moving" [...] and comended the writers for using the ensemble cast to reach a [...] "height of funniness" [...] and compared the [...] "mob mentality" [...] of the cast to The Simpsons. He ultimately awarded the episode a B+. IGN writer Cindy White called the episode a [...] "pretty {{good example of how}} to do an out-of-the-office episode right", considering it to be superior to other out-of-office episodes, including [...] "Christening" [...] and [...] "Gettysburg". She also complimented the characterization of the characters, specifically Jim, Pam and Dwight, and their relationships with each other. Despite this, she criticized the [...] "aforementioned characterization of Andy" [...] as well as the cold open, for making Andy too similar to Michael and later on commented that his new [...] "douche-bagery" [...] spoiled the episode for her. She ultimately gave the episode a 7.8/10, concluding that it was a [...] "good" [...] episode. Michael Tedder of New York gave a positive review and praised the scene featuring Jim and Dwight {{on the roof of the}} bus, and praised their dynamic for maturing over the years. Tedder also complimented Cranston's direction in the episode, commenting that the [...] "cramped quality of 'Work Bus' was well matched with Cranston's talents". He also wrote that the Nellie-Andy subplot had some potential to become [...] "promising" [...] if their rivalry continues through the rest of the season, but [...] "we'll have to see".|$|E

50|$|Boucherot was {{interested}} in using polyphase supplies to power asynchronous motors as early as 1894. The squirrel-cage rotor asynchronous motor was invented by Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky in 1889 and they were being built industrially from 1891. A problem with asynchronous machines {{is that they are}} difficult to start. The coupling to the rotor is weak until it <b>gets</b> <b>moving</b> and the current drawn by the motor is high. Boucherot solved this problem with his discovery of the double cage asynchronous motor in 1912. In fact, Dolivo-Dobrovolsky had already invented the double cage all the way back in 1893 but it was long since forgotten.|$|R

2500|$|Moltke (the Younger) made {{substantial}} {{changes to the}} offensive concept sketched by Schlieffen in the memorandum War against France of 1905–06. The 6th and 7th armies with eight corps were to assemble along the common border, to defend against a French invasion of Alsace-Lorraine. Moltke also altered {{the course of an}} advance by the armies on the right (northern) wing, to avoid the Netherlands, retaining the country as a useful route for imports and exports and denying it to the British as a base of operations. Advancing only through Belgium, meant that the German armies would lose the railway lines around Maastricht and have to squeeze the [...] of the 1st and 2nd armies through a gap [...] wide, which made it vital that the Belgian railways were captured quickly and intact. In 1908, the General Staff devised a plan to take the Fortified Position of Liège and its railway junction by coup de main on the 11th day of mobilisation. Later changes reduced the time allowed to the 5th day, which meant that the attacking forces would need to <b>get</b> <b>moving</b> only hours after the mobilisation order had been given.|$|E
