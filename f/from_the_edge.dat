The conditions for formation of the incomplete faceted shapes during dislocation growth are considered.

5|$|Originally budgeted at $400million, the new South Ferry station cost a {{total of}} $530million, {{with most of the}} money being a grant from the Federal Transit Administration {{earmarked}} for World Trade Center reconstruction. In January 2009, the opening was delayed because the tracks were too far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the platform. The problem was corrected and the station opened on March 16, 2009, with a new free transfer to between the 1 and the N, R, and W trains at the older Whitehall Street station. It was the first new subway station completed since 1989 when the IND 63rd Street Line stations opened.|$|E
5|$|The Castaing {{machine is}} a device used to add {{lettering}} and decoration {{to the edge}} of a coin. Such lettering was necessitated by counterfeiting and edge clipping, which was a common problem resulting from the uneven and irregular hammered coinage. When Aubin Olivier introduced milled coinage to France, he also developed a method of marking the edges with lettering which would make it possible to detect if metal had been shaved <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge.</b> This method involved using a collar, into which the metal flowed from the pressure of the press. This technique was slower and more costly than later methods. France abandoned milled coinage in favour of hammering in 1585.|$|E

A connection to the BMT Canarsie Line would use a pair of the tracks, while the other pair would go to Atlantic Avenue and Hicks Street in Brooklyn through an East River tunnel. Then it would turn down to Red Hook. There would also be a loop at Battery Park. Another branch would be built; it would consist of two tracks, and would go between 162nd Street and 190th Street via Amsterdam Avenue.|$|E
5|$|A simple {{frequency}} allocation {{problem can be}} specified as follows: a number of transmitters in a wireless network must choose a frequency channel on which they will transmit data. To avoid interference, transmitters that are geographically close should use channels with frequencies that are far apart. If this condition is approximated with a single threshold to define 'geographically close' and 'far apart', then a valid channel choice again corresponds to a graph homomorphism. It should go from the graph of transmitters G, with edges between pairs that are geographically close, to the graph of channels H, with edges between channels that are far apart. While this model is rather simplified, it does admit some flexibility: transmitter pairs that are not close but could interfere because of geographical features can added {{to the edges of}} G. Those that do not communicate at the same time can be removed from it. Similarly, channel pairs that are far apart but exhibit harmonic interference can be removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> set of H.|$|E

5|$|After leaving Stevenage, Byrom joined League One side Preston North End, then {{managed by}} Graham Westley, who had {{previously}} signed him for Stevenage. He signed on a free transfer. Byrom made his competitive debut for Preston in the club's 2–1 away victory over Bury, coming on as a second-half substitute. It took Byrom just three games to open his goalscoring account, scoring the first goal in the club's 5–0 win over Hartlepool United at Deepdale. In the club's following match four days later, on 22 September 2012, he netted in a 3–1 away defeat to Walsall, arriving unmarked {{in the area to}} give Preston an early lead in the match. His third and final goal of the campaign came at the beginning of November 2012, scoring <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the area in Preston's 3–0 FA Cup win over Yeovil Town. Byrom made 27 appearances, eleven of which as a substitute, during his first season with the club, scoring three times.|$|E
5|$|After {{starting}} {{in both of}} Stevenage's opening fixtures of 2011–12, Charles signed a contract extension on 11 August 2011, keeping him contracted to the club until 2013. Two days later, Charles scored his first goal {{of the season with}} a close range header in a 1–1 draw away at Chesterfield. Charles' appearances were sporadic throughout the remainder of 2011, with the player suffering from a knee injury. He made his first start in nearly two months in Stevenage's 1–0 away victory against Reading at the Madejski Stadium in the FA Cup on 7 January 2012, with Charles scoring the winning goal in the first-half with a finish <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the area. Charles' season ended prematurely after he suffered a hamstring injury in Stevenage's 1–1 draw with Wycombe Wanderers on 31 March 2012, with the injury ruling him out of action for up to six weeks. He made 34 appearances during the season, scoring five times.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the return}} of Tesche on a {{permanent}} contract seemed likely to endanger Davis's first-team place, he began the 2016–17 season in the starting eleven. He was booked {{in each of the}} first four matches, but two goals and a series of strong performances meant that when the fifth booking finally arrived in mid-October, he came straight back into the side after serving his suspension. He was named man of the match in the Second City derby against Aston Villa. Initially used on the right of midfield to counteract the attacking threat of Jordan Amavi, he moved into a more familiar central role after David Cotterill entered the match, and within minutes scored the equalising goal with a composed finish <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the penalty area. The goal earned him the club's Moment of the Season award.|$|E

5|$|At {{first he}} took soft clay in his bill <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> {{of the water}} and seemed to be {{smearing}} it on one leg near the knee. Then he fluttered away on one foot for a short distance and seemed to be pulling tiny roots and fibers of grass, which he worked into the clay that he had already smeared on his leg. Again he took some clay and plastered it over the fibers, putting on more and more till I could plainly see the enlargement, working away with strange, silent intentness for fully fifteen minutes, while I watched and wondered, scarce believing my eyes. Then he stood perfectly still for a full hour under an overhanging sod, where the eye could with difficulty find him, his only motion meanwhile being an occasional rubbing and smoothing of the clay bandage with his bill, until it hardened enough to suit him, whereupon he fluttered away from the brook and disappeared in the thick woods.|$|E

Barcelona won the {{historic}} match 2–6, which was the largest margin of victory by which Barcelona had won in Madrid since the 1970s, when Johan Cruyff led Barcelona to win 0–5. On 6 May 2009, Barcelona played against Chelsea in the second leg of the Champions League semi-finals. Following a goalless first leg, Chelsea led the second leg at Stamford Bridge 1–0, from the eighth minute until injury time, when Andrés Iniesta scored an equaliser in the 93rd minute <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the penalty area, sending Barcelona through to the final on the away goals rule. On 13 May, Barcelona beat Athletic Bilbao 4–1 to win the Copa del Rey for a record 25th time.
