40|$|Abstract. High {{contact stress}} between the vane tips and the cam ring {{is one of}} the main {{obstacles}} to improve the working pressure of a water <b>hydraulic</b> <b>vane</b> <b>pump.</b> A pressure-reducing valve for regulating the bottom pressure of the <b>vanes</b> at the <b>pump</b> suction zone is presented in this paper. Through optimization and simulation, it is found that the throttle structure has great influence on the dynamic performance of the pressure-reducing valve, and the triangular-rectangular groove is proved to be more suitable for the valve among all the investigated grooves. The theoretical analysis results show that the use of the pressure reducing valve can obviously reduce the contact forces between the cam ring and the vanes at the suction zone of the pump. The work in this research provides a feasible solution to improve the working pressure of a water <b>hydraulic</b> <b>vane</b> <b>pump...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} control the high PV value between the vanes and the cam ring in a water <b>hydraulic</b> <b>vane</b> <b>pump,</b> a pressure-reducing valve with a {{constant}} pressure ratio was developed in this study. The pressure and leakage characteristics of the valve were theoretically analyzed by simulation and the experiments were also conducted based on the valve prototype. The theoretical analysis agrees well with the experimental results. Further, these results reveal that the pressure ratio of the valve decreases to the design value with the increasing working pressure. Additionally, the leakage of the valve rises simultaneously with the increasing working pressure and can be reduced significantly by decreasing the clearance between the valve body and the spool. The presented research not only proves the successful development of the pressure-reducing valve but also lays a foundation for the investigation of a high-pressure water <b>hydraulic</b> <b>vane</b> <b>pump...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{possibility}} of {{application of the}} advanced hypertrochoid curve in the inner surface of the stator of fixed displacement <b>hydraulic</b> <b>vane</b> <b>pump,</b> theoretically was studied in the last our work. By considering the properties of this curve, sealing action between pressure and suction sides of the pump can be improved. One of the important characteristics of a new profile must be improving of the inertial reaction of the vanes in each position where these vanes have a radial movement because it causes a smooth sliding motion of the vanes and hence, a higher performance of the pump while attaining a longer life of it. Then at this paper, {{the effect of the}} inertial force of the vanes on the performance of the pump with this curve will be studied. The regular motion of the vanes on the inner surface of the stator with smooth profile suppresses the lateral reactional force applied to the vanes and results to diminish local wear of the vanes tip and noise.

In the <b>vane</b> <b>pump,</b> the friction torque arising from the friction between a cam contour and vane tips is significant. In this article, first, the values of the coefficient of friction between the vane tip and its sliding surfaces were measured by using cylindrical test rings with various kinds of surface roughness. Then the torque characteristics of <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> having cam ring contours with various values of surface roughness were measured and their results compared with the results of an analysis of the coefficient of friction investigated using test rings. As a result, the friction torque caused by the friction between the cam contour and the vane tip was reduced by lessening the surface roughness of the cam contour, resulting in an improvement of the mechanical efficiency. The coefficient of friction measured by using the test rings could be applied to the actual <b>vane</b> <b>pumps...</b>|$|R

These forces are composed of two components: a continuous component due to the exposure of chambers to the line port, and an intermittent component due to a hydraulic lock phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} reducing friction torque in a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> through a short-period pump operation by using physical vapour deposition (PVD) -coated vanes. It {{is well known that}} the friction torque in a <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> as well as in other hydraulic machines can be reduced by running-in through a long-time pump operation. This paper revealed that the reduction in the friction torque was derived from lowered friction between a cam contour and vane tips owing to the smoothed surface of a cam contour. Commonly, it was difficult to obtain such an effect through a short-period pump operation. The author has attempted to lessen the surface roughness of the cam contour and to decrease the friction torque of a vane {{in a short period of}} time by using vanes coated with an extremely hard PVD layer on their tips. In this study, three kinds of coatings of chromium nitride (CrN), titanium carbonitride (TiCN), and diamond-like carbon (DLC) by PVD were examined. It was found that the TiCN-coated vane was excellent in smoothing the surface roughness of the cam contour and in reducing the friction torque of the vane in a short period of time. It was also shown that the reduced friction torque of the vane depended essentially on the smoothness of the cam contour surface. In addition, the difference of the friction at the vane tip between an ordinary vane and coated vanes was indistinct for the same surface roughness of the cam contour below 0. 8 Î¼m Rz...|$|R
