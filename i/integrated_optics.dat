40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been an {{increased}} interest in the interaction of vortices and turbulence with free surfaces. A central issue in understanding the free surface turbulence is to relate the surface elevation to the near-surface flow field.

Therefore, in this abstract we present a new technique, <b>integrating</b> <b>optics,</b> colorimetry, and digital image processing, to measure the three-dimensional surface elevation for a time-evolving flow. The basic idea is to color code the surface slopes by light beams of different colors.

40|$|It was {{recently}} discovered that transparent micro-spheres and cylinders can function as super-resolution lens (i. e superlens) to focus light beyond the diffraction limit.

This natural bio-superlens can distinctly resolve 100 nm features under a conventional white-light microscope with peak wavelength at 600 nm, attaining a resolution of λ/ 6 that is well beyond the classical limit.

An optical waveguide is a viable means of delivering optical energy from one point to another in a microfluidic chip. A waveguide typically consists of two optically transparent materials with the material of higher refractive index forming a core and a material with lower refractive index forming the cladding. Such a structure is commonly seen in optical fibers. Different methods exist for <b>integrating</b> <b>optics</b> into a microfluidic chip – glass optical fibers can be embedded into polymer chips or polymeric waveguides may be patterned in parallel with the microfluidic chip[2]. These solutions require multi-step processes, different polymers and a lot of time to fabricate.
