5|$|McNary was the Republican {{vice presidential}} {{candidate}} in 1940, on the ticket with presidential candidate Wendell Willkie; both died in 1944, during {{what would have been}} their first term had they won. They lost to the Democratic ticket, composed of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was running for his third term as president, and Henry A. Wallace in a landslide.

He left Stanford and {{returned}} to Oregon in 1897 after his family asked him to come home. Back in Salem, he read law under the supervision of his brother John and Samuel L. Hayden, and passed the bar in 1898. The brothers practiced law together in Salem as McNary & McNary, while John also served as <b>deputy</b> <b>district</b> attorney for Marion County.

5|$|Wilder-Neligan's initial {{role was}} as a <b>deputy</b> <b>district</b> officer for the {{garrison}} of Rabaul {{on the island of}} Neupommern (later renamed New Britain). In May 1921, when the military administration of the former German colony was handed over to an Australian civil one mandated by the League of Nations, he was transferred to the administration of the newly created Territory of New Guinea as district officer for Talasea in west New Britain. Early in January 1923, the Administrator, Evan Wisdom, summoned him to Rabaul to answer allegations of financial malpractice that had been made against him by a former German planter. It appears that he resigned and sailed for Rabaul. Going ashore to rest for a few days at the village of Ekerapi before continuing his journey, he died during the night of 9/10 January. Survived by his wife and daughter, he died intestate and with debts.|$|E

40|$|This work {{considers}} how {{a ruling}} party in an increasing authoritarian regime utilizes legislative electoral system changes. It {{argues that the}} placement of former <b>district</b> <b>deputies</b> {{on the list of}} Russia’s ruling party after the move to a PR-only system reflected an interest in expanding its presence in the countryside as well as the attractiveness of the ruling party to the former <b>district</b> <b>deputies</b> themselves. It submits that both the party’s willingness to place former <b>district</b> <b>deputies</b> on its list and the willingness of the deputies to accept positions should vary by previous party affiliations, yielding predictable pat-terns in the aggregate. In terms of list ranking, it finds that the ruling party’s <b>district</b> <b>deputies</b> received significantly better placement than previously independent deputies, but not better placement than <b>district</b> <b>deputies</b> who made the list but had competed under a different party label in the previous election...|$|R
