5000|$|The song is more upbeat {{and urgent}} than Tunstall's UK lead single, [...] "(Still a) Weirdo".

She told Music Remedy, [...] "The person {{is still very much}} alive, but my interactions with them led to these weird, almost visitation-like feelings that I found difficult to shake off." [...] Tunstall expanded on the song to M Is For Music: [...] "The song is about when I met someone who had a really negative effect on me, and even though they were still alive, I experienced these almost visitation-like hauntings that I couldn't shake off. I took to wearing a t-shirt with the person's name on to try and exorcise them, which finally worked." ...|$|E

The lyrics are much stronger and the music is much heavier than in their previous two works which has earned the album a place in their top 3 as one of their best albums. LoudWire wrote [...] "the group offers one of their finest albums to date by digging deep and expressing themselves in a variety of ways". Nonetheless, most fans recognize Isolate and Medicate is most of all a clever album where Seether have risked very little presenting a wide range of styles that can easily meet the taste {{of a wide range of}} fans. AllMusic said [...] "Seether gravitate toward the melodic, a shift apparent in both the verses and the riffs, although there's still a tendency to grind out thick neo-grunge guitar workouts both slow ("My Disaster") and fast ("Suffer It All")". It can actually be a good album to re-discover Seether but it’s far from the heavy post-grunge style the longtime fans love. MusicReviewRadar said [...] "the exploratory character of the album is regrettable from a band that just 10 years ago knew exactly where they were heading… but is admirable from a band that lost their course somewhere in the past and is fighting to find their way back. Seether could have carried on the easy way but chose to crawl back to a slightly harder alternative rock style (as far from grunge as from pop). Good move!". BlabberMouth wrote [...] "Isolate and Medicate shows Seether trying to roll after more than a decade and a half in the life, but it presents a case of identity crisis, since it's apparent these guys are capable of writing pretty kickass stuff if left to their own devices.|$|R

Jones also commented that [...] "Bottom line - Steven Curtis Chapman has presented us with an album that is compelling, personal, and touching... This is an album that is destined to be ministering to generations long after ours is gone". Jared Johnson of Allmusic gave the album four-and-a-half out of five stars, commenting that [...] "Songs like Dive, Live Out Loud, and For the Sake of the Call, known for their big production, are stripped down to their barest essentials and brought back with new instrumentation and new life. Magnificent Obsession shines in totally new ways. As Chapman belts out, This is everything I want, this is everything <b>I</b> need, you <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> these words mean more to him than they did ten years prior", also noting that [...] "The original songs are just as strong, from the catchy first single Do Everything to the laid-back island vibe of Long Way Home." ...|$|R

At this point, any vote for anyone that is not Donald Trump is a vote for Hillary Clinton. Also, both Presidential boxes left blank is a vote for Hillary Clinton because as mindless as Liberals can be even they don’t enter into suicide pacts with that petulant, whiny part of themselves. As that is your wont, fine…do it! But don’t bullshit yourself. You’re electing Hillary Clinton because you want to elect Hillary Clinton."

5000|$|The prequel trilogy films often {{refer to}} the {{original}} trilogy {{in order to help}} connect the films together. Lucas has often referred to the films as a long poem that rhymes. Such examples include the line [...] "I have a bad feeling about this", a phrase used in each film, and lightsaber duels which almost always occur over a pit. As with Attack of the Clones, The Empire Strikes Back was the middle film in a trilogy, and of the original trilogy films, The Empire Strikes Back is the object of the most references in Attack of the Clones. In both films, an asteroid field is the backdrop of a major star battle {{in the middle of the}} film. Obi-Wan escapes Jango Fett by attaching his spacecraft to an asteroid in order to disappear from the enemy sensors; Han Solo uses a similar tactic by attaching the Millennium Falcon to a Star Destroyer in The Empire Strikes Back. As a retcon, John Knoll confirms on the film's DVD commentary that Boba Fett, who would later catch Solo in the act in The Empire Strikes Back, [...] "learned his lesson" [...] from the events of Attack of the Clones. In another scene, Obi-Wan asks Anakin [...] "Why do <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> you're going to be the death of me?" [...] This is an allusion to A New Hope where Anakin, as Darth Vader, kills Obi-Wan aboard the Death Star.

5000|$|.....stand {{back from}} each picture {{and take it}} all in, blink your eyes, and do it again. Then, move in close. Move in so your eyes nearly go crossed. Get close. Look at the brushwork. Look at the lines that fall like {{feathers}} across the canvas. The shapes they form {{look as though they}} grew there, organic. She applies her brush with surgical precision. Some of the forms appear cut and stenciled in place. Look close. You will not find a flaw, a misplaced stroke, a wandering streak of paint. Look at the spatters that land exactly where they should. Look at how she overlays color.Now, step back again, and appreciate her choice of color. It seems as though she perceives wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum that elude the rest of us. Her choice of color imbues her pictures with a radiant energy that pulls at you, like the ineffable force that draws subatomic particles close to one another, yielding the essential elements of the universe. Somehow, <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> she sees microwaves emanating from cell towers, or navigates guided by Earth’s magnetic field. She sees something {{the rest of us do}} not. I would not be surprised to hear that when she steps on to a glorious crowded beach drenched in glittering sunshine, populated by the myriad colors and contrasts of beach umbrellas, skin tones, sand, bathing suits, water—when she steps on that beach she feels breathless for the intensity of it. I would not be surprised if she hears music in the midst of such a clamorous riot of light—sort of an inverse synesthesia, where you see colors when you hear music. Somehow, she pairs colors that feel right, but are by no means obvious brethren. And those color pairings elevate her pictures to another plane where sensibility transcends sense.|$|E
5000|$|Looking at {{the artwork}} of Robert Koenig <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of having seen {{something}} similar, {{or at least}} artwork created in a similar spirit. These reminders result from experiences both personal and those from other creators seeking their own means of expression. They are, often intuitively, acquired layers of historical aspirations used towards the needs of expressing one's own feelings when confronted by nature, the fate of mankind or one's own emotions. As {{in the case of}} Koenig this means touching and discovering family events. For the artist inspiration can be found everywhere. It is enough to fire the imagination and to charge it with genuine emotion. The results appear in an unexpected way and surprise even the very creator who in professional and often unavoidably routine activities forgets about the need to constantly test one's sensitivity for the presence of the authentic world untainted by aesthetic calligraphy.Robert Koenig set in motion his own mechanism for perceiving matters which formed him through the experiences of the century in which many families and human groups gather knowledge about facts and exercise an adaptability to things both magnificent and tragic. Whilst regularly visiting family lands he creates a saga, by now however for universal use, because art always has a scope which goes beyond the enclaves of even the most typical for human fate.Especially the sculptures figures which seemingly express an indifference to the events which pass by but which in fact bow down over the inevitability of their fate. In this work, whether he wanted to or not, he continues the lament of the Greek chorus in the ancient tragedy. We can never protect our creativity from the dependence on the paralysing knowledge and philosophical indifference locked in ancient art. The consolation is that every creator, consciously or not, feels an irresistible urge to find himself in this honourable march towards wisdom and beauty.|$|E
30|$|This is {{a finely}} crafted, rich volume {{on a wide}} variety of topics of {{importance}} to Aoluguya Ewenki society. The articles have a heavy emphasis on reindeer husbandry and reindeer pastoralism, which is arguably the way that their nationality is most clearly defined by the state. On reading this book, <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that hunting, taiga life, and exchange are likely dearer to the hearts of people there. Keeping reindeer allows those important relationships to grow. Being better acquainted with Evenkis on the Russian side of the border, I am constantly surprised and challenged by texts like this on their Chinese kin. It is remarkable how the power of the Chinese state, and the influence of neighbouring peoples, create different concerns and challenges to a group which likely once shared many of the same features and traditions as Evenkis on the Russian side of the border. In terms of reindeer pastoralism, it is striking how the velvet antler economy dominates the pastoral techniques. In terms of the politics of forced resettlement, it is striking and somewhat sad how little seems to have been known in China about the social and ecological effects on indigenous communities of resettlements worldwide, if not nearby in the Russian Federation. With this book, and the project that sponsored it, one could hope for increased dialogue and communication with this rich and ultimately transnational pastoralist community at the edge of the Chinese taiga.|$|E
