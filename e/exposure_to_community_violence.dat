[...] However, {{it is important to}} note that these are not static factors, but rather transactional in nature (e.g., individuals are influenced by and also influence their environment). For instance, neighborhood safety and exposure to violence has been studied in conjunction with conduct disorder, but it is not simply the case that youth with aggressive tendencies reside in violent neighborhoods. Transactional models propose that youth may resort to violence more often as a result of <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>community</b> <b>violence,</b> but their predisposition towards violence also contributes to neighborhood climate.|$|E
50|$|Neighbourhoods and {{communities}} provide {{the context for}} school violence. Communities with high rates of crime and drug use teach youth the violent behaviors that are carried into schools. Dilapidated housing in the neighbourhood of the school {{has been found to}} be associated with school violence. Teacher assault was more likely to occur in schools located in high-crime neighbourhoods. Exposure to deviant peers is a risk factor for high levels of aggressivity. Research has shown that poverty and high population densities are associated with higher rates of school violence. Well controlled longitudinal research indicates that children's <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>community</b> <b>violence</b> during the early elementary school years increases the risk of aggression later in elementary school, as reported by teachers and classmates. Other, well controlled longitudinal research that utilized propensity score matching indicates that exposure to gun violence in early adolescence is related to the initiation of serious physical violence in later adolescence. Neighbourhood gangs are thought to contribute to dangerous school environments. Gangs use the social environment of the school to recruit members and interact with opposing groups, with gang violence carrying over from neighbourhoods into some schools.|$|E

The aim {{of the study was to}} explore possible differences in the expression of personality between adolescents exposed <b>to</b> <b>community</b> interpersonal <b>violence</b> and those not exposed to such violence. The sample comprised 183 grade 12 learners from a secondary school in a middle class community in Gauteng. Participants were divided into two groups: adolescents who reported <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>community</b> interpersonal <b>violence</b> (n = 93) and those who did not report <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> such violence (n = 90). Both groups completed the 16 Personality Factor and Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scales. Differences between the groups were explored using a one-way between groups multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and t-tests for independent groups. Results indicated statistically significant differences between the two groups on Factor G (rule consciousness), Factor I (emotional sensitivity) and Factor Q 4 (anxiety). Adolescents exposed to interpersonal violence reported higher levels of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms than the control group. The group that experienced PTSD symptoms differed more in terms of personality functioning (Factor I and Q 4). Violence-exposed adolescents experienced more emotional volatility, difficulty to regulate emotions, anxiety and sensitivity to environmental stressors than those not exposed to such violence. Although causality cannot be assumed, it is possible that <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>community</b> interpersonal <b>violence,</b> which could result in PTSD symptoms, has implications for the personality development of adolescents.

40|$|Objective: Although {{experiences}} of community violence are linked with negative outcomes {{for adults and}} children, few stan-dardized measures assessing community violence exist, and available measures lack consistency concerning the definition of community violence. Further, most measures currently utilized to assess adult <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>community</b> <b>violence</b> were designed for use with children and adolescents. To address these identified concerns and make recommendations for future research, this article reviews contemporary definitions of community violence, identifies the outcomes of <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>community</b> <b>violence</b> for adults, and evaluates measures of <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>community</b> <b>violence</b> with published psychometric data employing adult samples. Method: A systematic {{review of the literature}} was conducted to identify studies that (1) included a self-report of community violence exposure, (2) included primarily adult respondents, and (3) reported psychometric data.

The mechanisms through which <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>community</b> <b>violence</b> impacts adolescent adjustment are unclear. A change in adolescent schemas has been proposed as a mechanism through which the impact occurs. The goals of this study were to develop a measure of relevant adolescent schemas and examine their relation to <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>community</b> <b>violence.</b> A sample of 320 5 th and 8 th graders were assessed and confirmatory factor analyses of the measure supported a three factor model, including self-schemas, world schemas and use of violence schemas. <b>Exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>community</b> <b>violence,</b> including victimization and witnessing violence, was associated with more negative adolescent schemas.

Research {{on social}} ecologies of {{political}} violence has been largely confined to cross-sectional tests of the impact {{of political violence}} on child adjustment, limiting perspectives on more nuanced causal pathways, including tests of reciprocal relations between child adjustment and political violence. Based on a four-wave longitudinal design, this study breaks new ground in assessing bidirectional relations between sectarian <b>community</b> <b>violence</b> and children’s adjustment problems. Method. The study included 999 mother-child dyads selected from working class neighborhoods in Belfast ranked in the bottom quartile in terms of social deprivation in Northern Ireland, with approximately 35 - 40 families recruited to participate from each neighborhood. Across the four waves of data collected in consecutive years, child participants (52 % female) were 12. 18 (SD= 1. 82), 13. 24 (SD= 1. 83), 13. 62 (SD= 1. 99), and 14. 66 (SD= 1. 96) years old. Data Analysis. Cross-lagged path models were tested through R package lavaan with full information maximum likelihood. Results. Children’s <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> sectarian antisocial behavior in their <b>community</b> related <b>to</b> greater adjustment problems one year later. Reflecting a reciprocal pathway, children’s adjustment problems also related to their report of <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> sectarian antisocial behavior in their community one year later.

40|$|<b>Exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>community</b> <b>violence</b> is a {{pressing}} public health issue that disproportionately impacts poor, urban, and ethnic minority youth. It {{has been associated}} with a multitude of negative externalizing and internalizing symptoms, most frequently with posttraumatic stress. This study investigates the role that posttraumatic stress has in mediating the relation between <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>community</b> <b>violence</b> and other adjustment difficulties. Moreover, because not all adolescents experience these difficulties in the face of significant violence exposure, the study examines the moderating role of family cohesion and support in buffering the effect of violence and posttraumatic stress on later adjustment.

Impact on child behavioral outcomes has frequently been found; however, the effects of its use are not clear, particularly for African-American children. This systematic review of the literature examined the impact of <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> nonabusive {{physical punishment}} on the behavior of African-American children. METHODS: A search was conducted of PubMed and Psyclnfo from 1970 to 2000 using the key terms: corporal punishment, physical punishment, disciplinary practices, and discipline and parenting. Studies that described ethnicity of the population and included a majority of a well-described African-American population were included. Each study was required to include measurable data on child behavioral outcomes and at least one measure of discipline that assessed use of nonabusive physical punishment in children 0 - 14 years of age. RESULTS: All seven included studies used lower socioeconomic status (SES) and/or urban African-American populations. Study design and rural versus urban populations differentiated beneficial and detrimental outcomes. In all longitudinal studies, African-American children had beneficial or neutral outcomes. DISCUSSION: This review suggests that it is possible that there are benefits to nonabusive physical punishment for African-American children. However, needed are further longitudinal studies that better assess the multiple confounders that impact the use of discipline, such as SES, parental education level, and <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>community</b> or domestic <b>violence...</b>|$|R

The {{present study}} investigates the {{relationships}} between <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>community</b> <b>violence,</b> household demographic characteristics, social support, parenting attitudes and child/adolescent behavioural adjustment. Participants were drawn from two economically disadvantaged, high-violence neighbourhoods in the Western Cape. The total sample comprised 305 children aged between 9 and 16 years and their primary caregivers (N = 213). Questionnaires were administered to children at primary and high schools. Caregivers were administered questionnaires in their homes by trained research assistants. Children completed the Survey of <b>Exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>Community</b> <b>Violence,</b> the Piers-Harris Self-Concept Scale and the Social Support Scale for children. Caregivers completed a demographic questionnaire, the South African Child Assessment Schedule, the Adult-Adolescent Parenting Inventory and the Social Support Questionnaire for caregivers. Analyses of variance and covariance, Pearson's Product-Moment correlations, and hierarchical multiple regression procedures were conducted to establish direct and indirect relationships between <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>community</b> <b>violence,</b> household demographic characteristics, social support, parenting attitudes and child/adolescent behavioural adjustment. The {{results of this study}} indicate strikingly few violence-related behavioural disturbances in children and adolescents. Other variables, particularly parenting attitudes and child social support were identified as the most important determinants of child and adolescent outcomes. The findings additionally indicate that parental social support mediates the relationship between parental attitudes and internalising symptoms in participating children and adolescents. The need to develop more complex and comprehensive models of community, parental and child factors contributing to child/adolescent outcomes in high-risk South African neighbourhood contexts is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Previous studies {{find that}} {{childhood}} <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> family and <b>community</b> <b>violence</b> {{is associated with}} trauma symptoms. Few studies, however, have explored whether <b>community</b> <b>violence</b> exposure (CVE) predicts trauma symptoms after controlling for the effects associated with family violence exposure (FVE). In the current study, CVE and FVE were examined {{in a sample of}} 179 youth with a recent history of maltreatment. CVE was associated with trauma symptoms after controlling for FVE, but FVE was not associated with trauma symptoms after controlling for CVE. In addition, negative coping strategies (e. g., self-harm, interpersonal aggression) partially mediated the association between CVE and trauma symptoms. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for interventions aimed at addressing the needs of children exposed to violence. In the United States, family violence exposure (FVE) and <b>community</b> <b>violence</b> exposure (CVE) among children is a pervasive and serious problem. Recent estimates indicate that 30 % of youth in the United States have been exposed to at least one act of domestic violence in the previous year (McDonald, Jouriles, Ramisetty-Mikler, Caetano, & Green, 2006), with a large majority of these children (between 75 % and 95 %) also experiencing physical abuse (McCloskey, 2001; Smith-Slep & O’Leary, 2005). Similarly, a high percentage of youth are subjected to CVE. Studies involving youth from urban settings find that between 75 % and 90 % of adolescents have witnessed at least one act of violence in their neighborhood...|$|R
40|$|The {{level of}} crime in South Africa as {{reflected}} by crime statistics affects {{a high number of}} adolescents. Trauma and stress associated with interpersonal violence can adversely affect the neurobiology of the individual, since social, emotional and cognitive influences interact in multifaceted ways with neurobiological systems to affect every-day adaptive functioning. This study was embarked upon to determine the difference in the expression of personality between adolescents exposed <b>to</b> <b>community</b> related interpersonal <b>violence</b> and those not exposed to such violence. The 183 research participants were selected from a group of 335 grade 12 learners from a single secondary school in a middle class community. The participants were placed into two sample groups by means of purposive sampling as follows: Sample 1 consisted of all the research participants that reported <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>community</b> related interpersonal <b>violence</b> during the past 5 years on the self-reporting questionnaire (n = 93). The research participants that did not report <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> such violence formed Sample 2 (n = 90). Reflecting on the adolescent’s emotional, adaptive functioning and referring to high levels of anxiety and feelings of worthlessness, certain factors of the 16 PF questionnaire were predicted to show a statistical significant difference after <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>community</b> related interpersonal <b>violence</b> after a period of 3 to 5 years. To assess the differences in personality profiles of adolescents exposed <b>to</b> <b>community</b> related interpersonal <b>violence</b> and those not exposed to violence, a MANOVA was used in analysing 16 PF results. There were statistically {{significant differences between the two}} groups on Factor G (rule consciousness), Factor I (emotional sensitivity) and Factor Q 4 (anxiety). This indicated that adolescents exposed <b>to</b> incidents of <b>community</b> related interpersonal <b>violence</b> are inclined to experience more tension, are emotional volatile, depressed and anxious. They tend to be more sensitive to environmental stressors and are likely to give up easily. The group exposed to interpersonal violence (Sample 1) experienced higher levels of PTSD as assessed with the PSD Questionnaire than the group that was not exposed to interpersonal violence (sample 2). The personality profiles of three groups (Sample 1 with high PTSD, Sample 1 with low PTSD and Sample 2) were compared by means of a MANOVA to test whether adolescents who experience high levels of PTSD express their personality different from others. The results identify differences in the expression of personality between adolescents of Sample 1 experiencing higher levels of PTSD and the adolescents who did not experience <b>community</b> related interpersonal <b>violence</b> (sample 2) on Factors G- (Selfindulgent and disregards obligations to people), I + (Perception might be emotionally influenced) and Q 4 + (Elevated levels of anxiety). The coping style (positive or negative coping) of adolescents exposed <b>to</b> <b>community</b> related interpersonal <b>violence</b> was assessed using the Kidcope. This was done to examine the possible influence of coping on the development of posttraumatic stress and differences in the expression of personality. There were no correlations between positive and negative coping and the level of PTSD symptoms and the 16 PF. The research could therefore not identify coping as a medicating variable in the development of PTSD and differences in the expression of personality. However, research is required to evaluate coping closer to the time of the actual event. The results of this research are a clear indication that the experience of community-related violence has serious implications for the well-being and development of the personality of adolescents. Violence-exposed adolescents may experience symptoms characteristic of PTSD, including significant difficulty regulating one’s emotions and behaviour impacting on their social, cognitive, physiological and emotional functioning. The original target group for this study was the middle class income population and suburb with relatively good security. The sample was drawn from a typical middleclass environment and adolescents from communities with less protection may present different results if sampled for similar research.

40|$|Relatively {{little of}} the {{existing}} research on homelessness has focused on children. Those studies that do exist suggest that homeless children experience serious psychological and environmental problems. However, findings are inconsistent and most are comprised of nonrepresentative samples, have a limited range of measures with no evidence of reliability and validity, and, most importantly, lack appropriate comparison groups {{on which to base}} their results. The present study attempts to determine if there is a higher occurrence of psychological and environmental problems in homeless children when compared to a carefully matched sample of housed children using the same interview protocol and procedures. This study attempts to compare a representative sample of 54 homeless children (ages 4 - 10) to 54 demographically matched housed poor children on various psychological and environmental variables. A representative sample of homeless mothers with dependent children were recruited in the Detroit Metropolitan area. The comparison groups of housed mothers with dependent children were matched for age, gender, race, maternal age, and neighborhood (same zip code as the previous home of the currently homeless family). Mental health status was measured using the CBCL and Perceived Competence Scales. Environmental variables included privacy, safety, comfort, spaciousness, friendliness, overall quality, <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> domestic and <b>community</b> <b>violence.</b> A series of MANOVAs and Chi Squares were used to examine {{differences between the two groups}} (housed vs. homeless). Results indicated that the homeless children came from environments with more violence, less safety, spaciousness, and overall quality. The two groups did not differ on psychological variables: however, both the homeless and the housed had significantly higher scores on the CBCL than normative samples. Implications of this study suggest that, at least in the short-term, homelessness may not necessarily be detrimental to children 2 ̆ 7 s psychological functioning, particularly relative to the effects of poverty...|$|R
