40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{capacity}} problem for some multiple-access scenarios with cooperative transmitters. First, a general Multiple-Access Channel (MAC) with common information, i. e., a scenario where p transmitters send private messages {{and also a}} common message to q receivers and each receiver decodes all of the messages, is considered. The capacity region of the discrete memoryless channel is characterized. Then, the general <b>Gaussian</b> <b>fading</b> MAC with common information wherein partial Channel State Information (CSI) {{is available at the}} transmitters (CSIT) and perfect CSI is available at the receivers (CSIR) is investigated. A coding theorem is proved for this model that yields an exact characterization of the throughput capacity region. Finally, a two-transmitter/one-receiver <b>Gaussian</b> <b>fading</b> MAC with conferencing encoders with partial CSIT and perfect CSIR is studied and its capacity region is determined. For the <b>Gaussian</b> <b>fading</b> models with CSIR only (transmitters have no access to CSIT), some numerical examples and simulation results are provided for Rayleigh fading.

With the fading-link information, also known as channel state information (CSI), available locally at the respective transmitters and full CSI at the receiver, the analytical solution to optimal power problem is considered not feasible. We specialize alternating-maximization algorithm for computing the optimal powers and ergodic capacity of the decentralized <b>Gaussian</b> <b>fading</b> MAC channel.

40|$|Abstract — New non-asymptotic upper bounds on the {{capacity}} of non-coherent multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) <b>Gaussian</b> <b>fading</b> channels with memory are proposed. These bounds are used to derive upper bounds on the fading number of regular <b>Gaussian</b> <b>fading</b> channels and on the pre-log of non-regular ones. The resulting bounds are tight in the multiple-input single-output (MISO) spatially IID Gaussian case whence they yield the exact fading number and pre-log. A new approach is proposed for the derivation of lower bounds on the fading number of MIMO channels. This approach is applied to derive a lower bound on the fading number of spatially IID zero-mean <b>Gaussian</b> <b>fading</b> channels with memory. The new {{upper and lower bounds}} on the fading number demonstrate that when the number of receive antennas does not exceed the number of transmit antennas, the fading number of zero-mean spatially IID slowly varying Gaussian MIMO channels is proportional to the number of degrees of freedom, i. e., to the minimum of the number of transmit and receive antennas. We conjecture that the same is true also when the number of receive antennas exceeds the number of transmit antennas. The single-input multipleoutput case that was recently solved by Lapidoth & Moser supports this conjecture. I...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is the {{proposition}} of the κ-μ/Inverse Gaussian distribution which corresponds to a physical fading model. This is a composite distribution {{which is based on}} the κ-μ multipath model and the recently proposed Inverse Gaussian shadowing model. The former is a generalised model which includes as special cases the widely known Nakagamim, Rayleigh, Rice and one sided Gaussian distributions and accounts particularly for Non-Line-of-Sight communications. The latter is a convenient model which was recently shown to characterize shadowing effect more accurately than the widely used gamma distribution. As a result, the proposed composite model provides an overall efficient characterisation of multipath and shadowing effects which typically occur simultaneously. The offered modelling accuracy is achieved thanks to the remarkable flexibility of its parameters which is verified {{by the fact that the}} model is capable of providing good fittings to measurement data from realistic communication scenarios.

40|$|We {{consider}} a peak-power-limited single-antenna block-stationary <b>Gaussian</b> <b>fading</b> channel where neither the transmitter nor the receiver knows the channel state information, but both know the channel statistics. This model subsumes most previously studied <b>Gaussian</b> <b>fading</b> models. We first compute the asymptotic channel {{capacity in the}} high SNR regime and show that the behavior of channel capacity depends critically on the channel model. For the special case where the fading process is symbol-by-symbol stationary, we also reveal a fundamental interplay between the codeword length, communication rate, and decoding error probability. Specifically, we show that the codeword length must scale with SNR in order to guarantee that the communication rate can grow logarithmically with SNR with bounded decoding error probability, and we find {{a necessary condition for}} the growth rate of the codeword length. We also derive an expression for the capacity per unit energy. Furthermore, we show that the capacity per unit energy is achievable using temporal ON-OFF signaling with optimally allocated ON symbols, where the optimal ON-symbol allocation scheme may depend on the peak power constraint.

40|$|Abstract — We {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} feedback on the capacity of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) non-coherent fading channels with memory. We derive an upper bound on the feedback capacity of regular fading channels, which is shown to coincide with a previously known upper bound on the capacity without feedback. Hence, it is concluded that whereas feedback does in general increase capacity, this increase is relatively small {{in the sense that}} the same upper bound holds for both scenarios. From this bound we derive an upper bound on the MIMO fading number in the presence of feedback and show that in the single-input single-output (SISO) case this bound is tight, i. e., the SISO fading number is not changed by feedback. Next, we derive an upper bound on the feedback capacity of spatially independent MIMO <b>Gaussian</b> <b>fading</b> channels. From this bound we derive a new upper bound on the corresponding fading number and show that in the multiple-input single-output (MISO) case this bound is tight. Finally, in the case of a non-regular SISO <b>Gaussian</b> <b>fading</b> process we show that feedback does not increase the pre-log, i. e., the ratio of the capacity to the logarithm of the signal-to-noise ratio log SNR is not changed in the limit when the SNR tends to infinity.
