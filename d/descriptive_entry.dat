5000|$|The final {{category}} of VEC activity is the extensive (and growing) INTERMEDIA ARCHIVE, {{that is in}} a very real way a key component of Summers' art, not so much in what is collected, but in the gesture of creating <b>descriptive</b> <b>entries</b> (including log-in times and precise categories) for each object as it is added to the collection. This impeccable note-keeping and care exhibited for ephemera raises the act of collecting to the level of Sado (Tea Ceremony)--a gesture both precise and humanly generous to the present- (in artifact) -yet-absent artist—and is carried out by Summers almost as an end in itself. Some may see a similarity to Kurt Schwitters' Merz constructions, but Summers' VEC ARCHIVES is more systematically—even meditatively—done. Summers himself signals the importance (and the praxis) of the ARCHIVE in the Janssen interview (See reference 2), in which he tells of an early VEC action (1977) in Den Appel in Amsterdam. At the end of the performance the first VEC Mail Art Archive is destroyed, but as Summers says,"....noted artists participated in full knowledge of what would happen to their work at the end....A little documentation exists...including the shredded remains of the work destroyed." [...] That is, destruction/ conservation of the object are obverse sides of the same coin: both extremes exist on the same continuum in which gesture takes precedence over content, action over being.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study of the hearing records is to {{identify}} factors that are likely to impact the performance of a waterflood in the Nebraska panhandle. The records consisted of 140 cases. Most of the hearings were held prior to 1980. Many of the records were incomplete, and data believed to be key to estimating waterflood performance such as Dykstra-Parson permeability distribution or relative permeability were absent. New techniques were applied to analyze the sparse, incomplete dataset. When information is available, but not clearly understood, new computational intelligence tools can decipher correlations in the dataset. Fuzzy ranking and neural networks were the tools used to estimate secondary recovery from the Cliff Farms Unit. The hearing records include 30 <b>descriptive</b> <b>entries</b> that could influence {{the success or failure of}} a waterflood. Success or failure is defined by the ratio of secondary to primary oil recovery (S/P). Primary recovery is defined as cumulative oil produced at the time of the hearing and secondary recovery is defined as the oil produced since the hearing date. Fuzzy ranking was used to prioritize the relevance of 6 parameters on the outcome of the proposed waterflood. The 6 parameters were universally available in 44 of the case hearings. These 44 cases serve as the database used to correlate the following 6 inputs with the respective S/P. (1) Cumulative Water oil ratio, bbl/bbl; (2) Cumulative Gas oil ratio, mcf/bbl; (3) Unit area, acres; (4) Average Porosity, %; (5) Average Permeability, md; (6) Initial bottom hole pressure, psi. A 6 - 3 - 1 architecture describes the neural network used to develop a correlation between the 6 input parameters and their respective S/P. The network trained to a 85 % correlation coefficient. The predicted Cliff Farms Unit S/P is 0. 315 or secondary recovery is expected to be 102, 700 bbl...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the contents of type 2 diabetes patient self-management counselling documentation, how counselling of self- management appeared in various content areas and how patients’ self- management competence developed during the counselling. The research data consisted of nurses’ documentations from type 2 diabetes patient self- management counselling situations (N = 60) in primary health care. The data was collected in 2014 from the period between the years 2005 and 2014. Data were analyzed using content analysis as well as a case study approach. The documentation of self-management counselling included entries from content areas on nutrition, exercise, weight control, substance abuse, medication, self-monitoring, foot care, mood, and follow-up treatment. There were no entries related to sleep and rest content areas. The main focus of the self-management counselling documentation was <b>descriptive</b> <b>entries</b> related to nutritional discipline and change as well as planning and following medication care. In the descriptions, patients’ knowledge and skills were described briefly while their attitudes were described in a number of ways. The support offered by nurses consisted mainly of giving information. In addition, only in scattered instances did the patients’ own experiences, understanding, and the application of their knowledge to practice appear in the entries. Entries made on the guidance offered in self-management counselling situations consisted of short references to issues that were handled. They resembled notes more than they did considerations of patients’ progress in their need to change or evaluations of changes or competence development from the previous meeting. The overall guidance of the treatment path seemed illogical and in places even contradictory because early entries were not returned to. The same issues were repeated while others remained open. These findings suggest that self-management documentation should include the patient`s point of view more often than is currently the case. Findings are useful for the development of self-management counselling documentation...|$|R

In {{order to find}} out encyclopedic features, we choose a specific domain, disease, from an encyclopedia, analyze <b>descriptive</b> texts in <b>entries</b> of human disease, and derive features about the disease. The features are defined as structural, content-based, and linguistic ones. The content-based feature reflects the necessary characteristics of the concept. We also use linguistic features to extract the relevant information on the characteristics and organize it using the structural and content-based features. Our experiment shows that the encyclopedic features help the extraction of relevant information with 81 % of precision. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} longitudinal aspects of Japanese {{foreign direct investment}} in Canada. In looking at the longitudinal aspects, {{the focus was on}} a <b>descriptive</b> analysis of <b>entry</b> and exit rates and on an econometric analysis of the determinants of subsidiary survival and exit. In these analyses, we find that exit rates are related to subsidiary-level variables such as business size, expatriate employment levels, equity-ownership levels, and entry mode. The sector and region in which the investments are made is also related to subsidiary survival, with manufacturing-sector subsidiaries located in Ontario being the least likely to exit. The results of our study suggest that region and industry interact both to draw investment to a region and to influence the likelihood of survival of foreign-owned businesses. Furthermore, the focus an regional issues for Canada shows that even within a small open economy subnational (interprovincial) variance can have important effects on the characteristics and performance of foreign direct investment...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} paper {{considers the}} role of vocal behaviour {{in the construction of}} Self. It examines evidence from an ongoing research project investigating the nature and function of singing in men's everyday lives. The present article looks at how men create and regulate identity through singing and through the construc-tion of personal narratives about their vocal behaviour. Extensive, informal, vocal-history interviews were carried outwith eight men who all sing in a male-voice choir in north-east Iceland. Additionally these men and sixteen others who sing in the same choir, kept one-week vocal diaries, making regular <b>descriptive</b> and reflective <b>entries</b> about their own vocal activity. Using the methodology of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis OPAl, the study explores personal perceptions of vocal behaviour. Emerging themes suggest that singing is seen by these men as a central concept of Self. Furthermore, these themes appear to correspond closely to the psychological theory proposed by Robert Weber in his recent revision of William James's seminal, triadic model of Self. Data are discussed here in relation to this particular theoretical framework. Men's vocal behaviour appearsto be an important technology of Self;that is, a forming agent and defining concept in tripartite elements of body, persona and spirit. Findings illustrate singing's agency in the changing Self and in the maintaining of core and unitary Selfs, and they exemplify ways in which personal identities can be vocally-constructed, performed and celebrated...|$|R
