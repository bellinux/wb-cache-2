5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was controlled by}} a fighter-type control stick and rudder bar which operated the powered flying controls (PFCs). Each PFC had a single <b>electro-hydraulic</b> powered flying control unit (PFCU) except the rudder which had two, one running as a back-up. Artificial feel and autostabilisation {{in the form of}} pitch and yaw dampers were provided, as well as an auto mach trimmer.|$|E
5|$|The best-known {{hallmark}} of Vanaja, the full-load lifting tandem axle, {{was introduced in}} January 1957. This invention enabled an additional load of 2.5 tonnes to be carried and the entire load on the tandem could be moved to the fore axle using an <b>electro-hydraulic</b> system. The system improved the traction, offering a significant advantage on slippery surfaces. The innovative lifting tandem was developed under leadership of the company's chief engineer Veikko Muronen. Vanaja became the leader in the Finnish logging vehicle market and maintained this position until production ceased. In forestry work, a layout with a driven front axle and a tandem axle with a driven fore axle, called 4×4+2, became famous in Finland but is seldom seen outside the Nordic countries.|$|E

25|$|In flight, the Puma was {{designed}} to be capable of high speeds, exhibit great maneuverability, and have good hot-and-high performance; the engines have an intentionally high level of reserve power to enable a Puma to effectively fly at maximum weight with only one functioning engine and proceed with its mission if circumstances require. The cockpit has conventional dual controls for a pilot and copilot, a third seat is provided in the cockpit for a reserve crew member or commander. The Puma features a SFIM-Newmark Type 127 <b>electro-hydraulic</b> autopilot; the autopilot is capable of roll and pitch stabilization, the load hook operator can also enter corrective adjustments of the helicopter's position from his station through the autopilot.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{adopted an}} atypical tail-first configuration; this approach {{had the effect}} of greatly reducing trim-drag while also generating increased lift at slower speeds. Longitudinal control was provided by the nose-mounted tail plane via trailing edge elevators, lateral control was enacted by ailerons located on the wing's trailing edge, and directional control was achieved by a conventional rudder. All four of the primary flight control surfaces were actutated by a quadruple-redundant <b>electro-hydraulic</b> control unit, designed by Boulton Paul. Fly-by-wire electrical controls and automatic control systems were also to be employed on the type. The undercarriage, designed by Dowty Group, used an arrangement of a single centre-fuselage main unit complete with four wheels, a nose unit with two wheels, and a pair of outriggers located on the engine nacelles.|$|E

2500|$|The BL1 and BL2 were {{virtually}} identical, differing only in throttle mechanism. The only BL1 was built with an air-actuated throttle. The BL1 was {{converted to a}} BL2 in February 1948 by replacing the air-actuated throttle with a standard electrically-actuated throttle. The production BL2 used the standard <b>electro-hydraulic</b> governor and notched throttle as used in the F3. While EMD public relations claimed {{the difference between the}} BL1 and BL2 was a lack of Multiple Unit control, photographs of the BL1 demonstrator clearly show it was MU-equipped.|$|E
2500|$|The load {{regulator}} {{is essentially a}} large potentiometer that controls the main generator power output by varying its field excitation and hence the degree of loading applied to the engine. [...] The {{load regulator}}'s job is relatively complex, because although the prime mover's power output is proportional to RPM and fuel rate, the main generator's output is not (which characteristic was not correctly handled by the Ward Leonard elevator- and hoist-type drive system that was initially tried in early locomotives). Instead, a quite complex <b>electro-hydraulic</b> Woodward governor was employed. Today, this important function would be performed by the Engine control unit, itself {{being a part of}} the Locomotive control unit.|$|E

The trim levels include the L, LE, SE, XLE, SE V6, XLE V6, Hybrid LE, Hybrid XLE and for 2014 a Hybrid SE model. All models except for the hybrids are standard with six-speed automatic transmissions. No manual transmissions are offered. Hybrids are equipped with an eCVT transmission. The SE model gets paddle shifters, and a stiffer suspension. The new model has increased fuel economy due to lighter weight, a sleeker body, and low rolling-resistance tires.|$|E

2500|$|From January to March 2009, turbine2 was {{undergoing}} scheduled repairs and modernization. It {{was the first}} and only turbine in the station which was equipped with a new <b>electro-hydraulic</b> regulator of its rotational speed supplied by the Promavtomatika company. [...] During the course of the repair, the turbine blades were welded, because after a long period of operation, cracks and cavities had once again appeared. The turbine runner was not properly rebalanced after these repairs, following which turbine2 had increased vibrations, ca [...] for the main bearing during the full load of the turbine. While this did not exceed specifications, the increased vibrations were unacceptable for long term use. The elevated vibration levels compared to other turbines were apparent for turbine 2 before the repair as well.

2500|$|Modern {{knowledge}} {{of the effect of}} earthquakes on structures led to a program to retrofit the Golden Gate to better resist seismic events. The proximity of the bridge to the San Andreas Fault places it at risk for a significant earthquake. Once thought {{to have been able to}} withstand any magnitude of foreseeable earthquake, the bridge was actually vulnerable to complete structural failure (i.e., collapse) triggered by the failure of supports on the [...] arch over Fort Point. A $392million program was initiated to improve the structure's ability to withstand such an event with only minimal (repairable) damage. One challenging undertaking is completing this program without disrupting traffic. A complex <b>electro-hydraulic</b> synchronous lift system was custom built for construction of temporary support towers and a series of intricate lifts, transferring the loads from the existing bridge onto the temporary supports. This was completed with engineers from Balfour Beatty and Enerpac, accomplishing this task without disrupting day-to-day San Francisco commuter traffic. The retrofit was planned to be completed in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|EE-9U Cascavel MX-8: Version modernized by Equitron for the Brazilian Army and {{the other}} Cascavel users. It is {{equipped}} with a 300hp (220kW) MTU / Mercedes electronic engine with overcharging by turbocharger and intercooler. The boomerang suspension has received improvements in performance, the disc brake system is completely new and the engine exhaust drawing as well, expelling the air upwards and not backwards, thus reducing the thermal signature of the car. It also provides a highly praised air conditioning system for the crew. Integrates night vision for the driver and shooting systems. The tower received the <b>electro-hydraulic</b> system of rotation and tube elevation (back-up by manual system) similar to that used in the German KMW's Leopard tank, as well as receiving the laser, thermal and infrared rangefinder systems made by Orlaco, of Netherlands, selected by the commander and / or shooter through a joystick and associated keys, and increased ammunition capacity in the tower.

2500|$|The 1988 Fiero {{brought a}} new {{suspension}} design, thought by many to have {{a striking resemblance to}} those designed by Lotus, which at the time, was about to be acquired by General Motors. The suspension was never a Lotus design though; it was the suspension the Pontiac engineers had designed in the beginning, along with what they learned from the racing program. Up front were revised control arms and knuckles that reduced steering effort and improved the scrub radius. In the back, the old Citation parts were replaced with a real tri-link suspension with all new knuckles. This new suspension came with staggered wheel sizes on WS6 suspension equipped models, with [...] by [...] wide wheels up front and [...] by [...] wide wheels in the rear for improved handling balance and to offset the slightly increased front track that resulted from the improvements. Topping off the package were the new vented disc brakes at all four corners, which addressed braking complaints of road testers. A variable effort <b>electro-hydraulic</b> power steering unit, the same design later found on the GM EV1, was also to be a late addition. This option never made it to production — one reason cited is that models with the prototype power steering were noted as being too loud. The four-cylinder engine received an in-pan oil filter element and balance shaft. A [...] "Formula" [...] option was added, which offered many of the GT features with the standard coupe body, including the [...] speedometer, WS6 Suspension (which includes offset crosslace wheels) and the rear spoiler. 1988 marked the end of production for the Fiero, and is also considered to be the best Fiero produced. Improvements to suspension, brakes, steering, and improvements to both the four-cylinder and V6 engines took the car to a level far beyond the 1984 model that had received much criticism. 1988 was also the only year a yellow exterior color was available as a factory option. During the Fiero's final model year (on August 16, 1988) the last window sticker was placed on the last Fiero to roll off the Pontiac, Michigan plant line. The 1988 Fiero is the most desired by automotive collectors because of the improvements made to the 1988 model year, and this being the last year of production. The 1988 Mera seen as the most sought after model and tops the Fiero list in resale value this model is commonly used to create [...] "kit cars" [...] (replicas of high end sports cars).|$|E
