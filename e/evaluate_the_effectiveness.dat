A recent study investigated the use of miRNA as a biomarker in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, a form of pancreatic cancer. The study analyzed RNA from biopsied pancreatic cysts to identify deviations in expression of miRNAs. The study found that 228 miRNAs were expressed differently relative to normal pancreatic cells. Included in the findings was an association between hepatocellular carcinoma and the upregulation of miR-92a, a member of OncomiR-1.|$|E

25|$|Insulin pumps, cartridges, and {{infusion}} sets may be {{far more}} expensive than syringes used for insulin injection with several insulin pumps costing more than $6,000; necessary supplies can cost over $300. Another disadvantage of insulin pump use is {{a higher risk of}} developing diabetic ketoacidosis if the pump malfunctions. This can happen if the pump battery is discharged, if the insulin is inactivated by heat exposure, if the insulin reservoir runs empty, the tubing becomes loose and insulin leaks rather than being injected, or if the cannula becomes bent or kinked in the body, preventing delivery. Therefore, pump users typically monitor their blood sugars more frequently to <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of insulin delivery.|$|E
25|$|Though no {{formulation}} of progesterone is approved for use via sublingual administration, {{a few studies}} have investigated the use of progesterone by this route. A study of sublingual progesterone for luteal support in patients undergoing embryo transfer found that after sublingual administration of 50 or 100nbsp&mg progesterone dissolved in a 1nbsp&mL suspension, peak levels of progesterone were reached in 30 to 60 minutes and were on average 17.61nbsp&ng/mL with the 100-mg dose. However, the duration was short and re-administration had to be done two or three times per day for adequate circulating levels of progesterone to be maintained throughout the day. Another study found that sublingual progesterone had to be administered at a dose of 400nbsp&mg every 8nbsp&hours to achieve circulating levels similar to those produced by 100nbsp&mg/day intramuscular progesterone. Further clinical research is necessary to <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of progesterone via the sublingual route of administration.|$|E

While King George V and Ajax were scrapped, Centurion was demilitarized by the removal of her armament and was converted into a radio-controlled target ship. In addition to {{being used as a}} target for surface ships, Centurion was used to <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of various types of aerial bombing. During the Second World War, she was rearmed with light weapons and was converted into a blockship in 1941. In preparation for that operation (subsequently cancelled), she was modified into a decoy with dummy gun turrets in an attempt to fool the Axis powers. Centurion was sent to the Mediterranean in 1942 to escort a convoy to Malta, although the Italians may have figured out the deception. The ship was scuttled off Omaha Beach in June 1944 to form a breakwater to protect a mulberry harbour built to supply the forces ashore.|$|E

She was commissioned on 15 June 1912 at Devonport. Including her armament, her cost is variously quoted at £1,892,823 or £1,885,145. Thunderer and her sister ships comprised the Second Division of the 2nd Battle Squadron (BS) of the Home Fleet. The ship, together with her sisters [...] and , participated in the Parliamentary Naval Review on 9 July at Spithead. They then participated in training manoeuvres with Vice-Admiral Prince Louis of Battenberg commanding the [...] "Blue Fleet" [...] aboard Thunderer. On 13 November, the ship participated in comparative gunnery trials with Orion to <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of the former's gunnery director. Thunderer decisively outshot the latter ship, although some of her success was because her director was above the smoke that obscured the target from Orions guns. The test was repeated in better conditions on 4 December and Orion performed much better, apparently beating Thunderer. The three sisters were present with the 2nd BS to receive the President of France, Raymond Poincaré, at Spithead on 24 June 1913. During the annual manoeuvres in August, Thunderer was the flagship of Vice-Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, commander of the [...] "Red Fleet". On 4 November, Thunderer, Orion, the dreadnought [...] and the predreadnought [...] fired at and sank the target ship [...] to give their crews experience in firing live ammunition against a real ship.|$|E

The article analyzes the basic problems of evaluation <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of civil service modernization and scientific papers on these issues. The basic theoretical approaches {{to the definition of}} «assessment» and «evaluation» are studied. Existing theoretical and methodological approaches to the assessment process are analyzed and summarized, the main methods of <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of <b>the</b> civil service modernization and the most common assessment methods are defined. Eligible for <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of civil service modernization are special analytical techniques: functional review, Balanced Scorecard, taxonomic analysis, Key Performance Indicators, methods of multivariate analysis and others. Among the methods of studying consumer expectations about <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of <b>the</b> civil service modernization such ones are singled out: questionnaires, surveys, interviews, testing, monitoring, analysis of statistical sources, contents of documents, reports and regulatory framework and others. The methods of improving efficiency include: benchmarking, reengineering, performance assessment models and more. The importance of gradual replacement of cost evaluation methods by the results evaluation method is determined. It was shown the need for a comprehensive balanced scorecard to evaluate. With a view to the mutual agreement of principles, mechanisms and instruments for <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of civil service modernization the expediency of a systematic, targeted, synergistic, process, situational, strategic and resource approaches is grounded. Development of theoretical concepts and methodological principles of <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of civil service modernization should be based on the harmonious combination (integration) of all these approaches to modernization. Among the models of evaluation of efficiency such ones are studied: the essential, economic and professional models, model CAF, the process model etc. The basic components of evaluation models are analyzed.
