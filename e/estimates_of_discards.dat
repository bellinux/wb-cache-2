40|$|Total marine {{fisheries}} catches by Latvia in the Baltic Sea (or its equivalent entity {{prior to}} {{separation from the}} USSR in 1991) were estimated from 1950 - 2007 using an approach called ‘catch reconstruction’. ICES landing statistics (which only report commercial landings) formed the baseline of the reconstruction, to which we added ‘adjustments to ICES landing statistics ’ (particularly disaggregated data from when Latvia {{was part of the}} USSR), estimates of unreported landings, <b>estimates</b> <b>of</b> <b>discards,</b> and estimates of recreational catches. The reconstructed catch from 1950 - 2007 is approximately 4. 7 million tonnes, attributing an additional 3. 5 million tonnes to Latvia above catches reported by ICES for independent Latvia. From 1991 - 2007 when ICES landing statistics were reported for Latvia independently, our reconstructed catch was 28 % higher than their reported 1. 2 million tonnes. The most commercially important species are herring (Clupea harengus), sprat (Sprattus sprattus), and cod (Gadus morhua). We believe that this reconstruction represents a conservative estimate...|$|E

Not only are the stocks of discarded species affected, but entire trophic webs and habitats may be disrupted at the ecosystem level. This paper reviews discarding in the marine fisheries of the United States, however, the type and diversity of fisheries as well as regulatory mechanisms are similar to developed fisheries and management programs throughout the world.

40|$|<b>Estimates</b> <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> by the Dutch pelagic freezer-trawler fleet {{were derived}} {{based on data}} from {{observers}} on board commercial vessels. In all, 27 fishing trips of duration 2 – 5 weeks each were sampled between 2002 and 2005, covering the North Sea and the western waters of the British Isles. Different methods to estimate discards were compared, and raising these estimates by number of trips or by total landings did not greatly influence the annual estimates of total discards. Some 30 000 t of fish were discarded annually by the fleet, the commercial target species mackerel, herring, and horse mackerel being discarded most, with 41 %, 19 %, and 15 % of the total discards by weight, respectively. The most commonly discarded non-commercial species was boarfish, accounting for 5 % of total discards. Slippage accounts for 10 % of all discards, and the most common species slipped is herring.

40|$|Discarding in commercially {{exploited}} fisheries {{has received}} considerable {{attention in the}} last decade, though only more recently in Australia. The Reef Line fishery (RLF) of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) in Australia is a large-scale multi-sector, multi-species, highly regulated hook and line fishery {{with the potential for}} high levels <b>of</b> <b>discarding.</b> We used a range of data sources to estimate discard rates and discard quantities for the two main target groups of the RLF, the coral trout, Plectropomus spp, and the red throat emperor, Lethrinus miniatus, and investigated possible effects on <b>discarding</b> <b>of</b> recent changes in management of the fishery. Fleet-wide <b>estimates</b> <b>of</b> total annual quantities discarded from 1989 to 2003 were 292 – 622 t and 33 – 95 t for coral trout and red throat emperor, respectively. Hypothetical scenarios of high-grading after the introduction of a total allowable commercial catch for coral trout resulted in increases in discard quantities up to 3895 t, while no high-grading still meant 421 t were discarded. Increasing the minimum size limit of red throat emperor from 35 to 38 cm also increased discards to an estimated 103 t. We provide spatially and temporally explicit <b>estimates</b> <b>of</b> <b>discarding</b> for the two most important species in the GBR RLF of Australia to demonstrate the importance of accounting for regional variation in quantification <b>of</b> <b>discarding.</b> Effects <b>of</b> management changes on discarding are also highlighted.

40|$|Obtaining a {{representative}} <b>estimate</b> <b>of</b> <b>discard</b> mortality for population and ecosystem assessments is very challenging. This can only rarely be done directly by recovering tagged discarded individuals. Instead, semi-quantitative measures of individual fish vitality or physical condition, obtained by onboard observers prior to discarding, can be used. Such vitality measures {{can be a}} good indicator <b>of</b> <b>discard</b> mortality, and by virtue of the data collection method, should also reflect the condition <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> throughout the fishery. Furthermore, vitality can be predicted using covariates known to affect discard mortality, allowing for a more general assessment. We argue that {{a representative}} mortality rate can be estimated using the product of at least two probabilities: that of belonging to a particular vitality class, conditional on the factors experienced during capture and catch handling; and the probability of surviving the event, conditional on pre-release vitality. Here we estimate mortalities for five fish taxa captured in southern Gulf of St. Lawrence fisheries. The conditional survival probabilities were obtained using survival analysis of data from experiments in which fish were captured using commercial fishing methods and held to assess short-term mortality (2 – 3 days). The analysis included a mixture model with a fraction of unaffected individuals, which appears appropriate for data from bycatch mortality studies. Based on this study and the mechanistic interpretation of the mixture model, short-term monitoring <b>of</b> <b>discard</b> mortality may be sufficient to characterize longer term impacts in a number of taxa. 13 page(s...|$|R

In 2007, the average discard rates of skipjack and yellowfin tunas under FAD were estimated at 42. 9 kg and 1. 3 kg per ton landed, respectively. The average rate of “faux poisson ” for skipjack and yellowfin landed by the French purse seine fleet was estimated about 150 kg and 15 kg per ton of fish destined to the canneries during 2004 - 2007, respectively.

40|$|A {{review of}} factors {{affecting}} the mortality of discarded Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Last update: July 16, 2011 Previous {{assessments of the}} Gulf of Maine Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) stock have included <b>estimates</b> <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> from the commercial and recreational fisheries. These estimates have assumed {{that there was no}} survival of fish discarded at sea. The topic of discard mortality and evaluation of appropriate mortality rates was included as a term of reference for the most recent Gulf of Maine cod assessment (NEFSC, 2012). Ultimately, the assessment concluded “…that the published studies probably overestimated survival, although it was difficult to characterize the extent of the bias. The discard mortality rates to be used in SARC 53 for Gulf of Maine cod are 100 % for all gears. ” There is a growing body of literature suggesting that there may be some survival of fish discarded at sea with the survival contingent on multiple factors including gear type, fish size, depth, season, soak duration and overall handling care. Incorporating the results from experimental studies into absolute estimates of fisheries removals is difficult due to the number of factors, the high degree of interactions effects and the uncertainty in the general population. This paper provides an overview of the scientific literature relevant to the survival of Atlantic cod discarded in the commercial fishery. While recreational catch is an important component of total catches of cod in United States waters, no known information exists on the survival of cod discarded in the recreational fishery...|$|E
40|$|Discarding {{of small}} fish {{has been and}} still is a large problem in many fisheries. It is a problem {{because most of the}} {{discarded}} fish die and are a direct loss to the biomass of the stock. When discards occur and it is not accounted for in the assessment, the total mortality from the stock is underestimated. Thus, it will cause bias in the VPA estimates and in analysis based on these estimates. In the present work, discards in the commercial trawl fishery for Northeast Arctic cod, during the years 1946 - 1998, were estimated from two points of view. The first was to assume that the USSR did not have any discards and adjust the other countries' catch at age distributions according to the USSR landings. The second was to use selectivity properties and abundance estimates to estimate age distributions in the catches and adjust the catches according to these. The differences between the estimated and reported catch numbers were then regarded as discards. New VPA numbers at age were estimated and the biological reference point Fmed was calculated. The results from the first approach were considered not to be any reliable. The results from the second approach were as expected, high in the 1950 s and 1960 s with a decreasing trend towards the 1980 s. The results indicate also that the USSR had discards or that they had errors in the reported catches. Discards were shown to have a large influence on the VPA estimates, especially stock numbers at age three, which resulted in a small increase in the value of Fmed. Due to the large errors in the VPA stock numbers of Northeast Arctic cod, as indicated by the <b>estimates</b> <b>of</b> <b>discards,</b> it is suggested that the Arctic Fisheries Working Group should revise the catch numbers at age that are used in the VPA...|$|E
40|$|Fisheries {{management}} of the Pacific Trawl Rationalization Program fishery relies on efficient and accurate estimation of the weight <b>of</b> <b>discarded</b> Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) groundfish species (and species groups) {{that occur in the}} fishery. Quota {{management of}} these species is based on weight of fish harvested and discarded. At-sea compliance monitors are currently deployed into this fishery to identify and weigh all at-sea <b>discards</b> <b>of</b> IFQ species (100 % monitoring). This requirement is necessary since there are currently no other methods to speciate and <b>estimate</b> weights <b>of</b> atsea <b>discards.</b> However, on-board monitors can increase costs and reduce flexibility in the fishery.

40|$|Skates and {{rays are}} a common {{component}} of mixed demersal fisheries, and large quantities may be discarded. Given their biological vulnerability, understanding the fate of these elasmobranchs is <b>of</b> management concern. <b>Estimates</b> <b>of</b> <b>discard</b> survival are needed for modelling the possible benefits of management measures. In this study, {{the focus is on}} the Bristol Channel skate fishery, where on-board holding tanks were used to assess the short-term rates of survival of trawl-caught skates (Rajidae). From monitoring the survival rates of 162 fish kept in specially designed on-board holding tanks for periods of up to 72 h, the short-term rate of survival was 55 %. Visual inspection of "health" at time zero was a good indicator of survival, because 79 % of skates with a poor health score did not survive. Mortality rates for fish of moderate health and good "health" were 16 % and 5 %, respectively. This information allows one to predict the consequences of fishing practice on discard survival using a larger dataset on fish scored for health before tagging and release. The proportion in poor condition on capture is positively correlated with estimated codend weight, so technical modifications to fishing gear aimed at reducing unwanted by-catch would increase the survival <b>of</b> <b>discarded</b> skates. Combined with information on discarding rates in the study area, the results indicate that discard mortality removes almost as many fish from the skate stock as are landed commercially...|$|R
40|$|Empirical <b>estimates</b> <b>of</b> <b>discard</b> {{survival}} {{are difficult}} to obtain due to the complex logistics of survival studies, either by accommodating organisms in holding tanks or by tagging. There are few studies on the survival <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> in beam trawl fisheries (Table A 1 in APPENDIX for an overview until 2013), and up till today (March 2014) {{most of them have}} focused on the short-term survival using holding facilities in on-board tanks (Depestele et al., 2014; Revill et al., 2013) or underwater cages (Uhlmann et al., 2014; van Marlen et al., 2013). To our knowledge only very limited information is available on successful tagging studies in beam trawl fishery. As a consequence of the complex methodology, there are only a very limited number of species and/or individuals investigated, thus leading to the investigation of yet another modest number of influential factors. The complex logistic nature of onboard survival tank studies, especially when conducted on-board commercial vessels, resulted in a narrow focus of potential key aspects, such as haul duration, number of tickler chains (van Beek et al., 1990), catch weight (Depestele et al., 2014), or maturity (Revill et al., 2013), etc. Major influential factors could nevertheless be numerous. Beam trawl fisheries, as many other fisheries, disturb fish throughout the catching process, starting by the encounter of the chains (or pulses), followed by a stressing period (e. g. fish trying to escape the net) and culminating in a physical and internal damaging process during retention in the codend, release on deck, and subsequent sorting...|$|R

Few ToR could not be accomplished due to time constraints and/or data deficiencies and will be accomplished during the forthcoming STECF EWG 13 - 13 fishing effort regime evaluations part 2 (7 - 11 October 2013, Barza d’Ispra, Italy). Outstanding ToRs are those dealing with the requested comparative analyses regarding cod and sole selectivity of fully documented fisheries (FDF) and fisheries not participating in FDF schemes, detailed evaluations of the national implementation as regards fishing effort derogations granted under the provisions of article 13 of the new cod plan (Counc. Reg. No 1342 / 2008), as well as spatio-temporal patterns in cod catchability. STECF EWG 13 - 06 tasks have been supported by the DCF fishing effort data call in 2013. STECF EWG 13 - 06 notes a general improvement in data completeness and quality as well as compliance with dead lines regarding Member States’ data provisions. However, STECF EWG 13 - 06 suffered again from delays, incompleteness and erroneous data submissions and re-submissions. Details about the DCF data call definitions, data quality in 2013 and significant shortfalls as identified by JRC and the experts contributing to the working group are summarized in section 4. STECF EWG 13 - 06 notes that its recommendations in 2012 to amend the 2013 DCF data call to support fishing effort regime evaluation have been implemented and that these changes have supported and will support the accomplishment of specific ToR. STECF EWG 13 - 06 noted that the DCF data call in 2013 required re-submissions of re-aggregated data {{in addition to the}} re-quested data update for 2012, which implied additional workload for the national institutions involved in the DCF framework. Notably Denmark, Portugal and UK (without Scotland) have revised their complete time series of fisheries specific catch and effort data. Spanish data were made available for 2012 and discard data were inserted to earlier data submissions to support the effort regime evaluation for Southern hake and Nephrops. STECF EWG 13 - 06 notes that ICES (WGMIXFISH 2013) has undertaken a detailed comparison of the 2011 ICES fisheries data received in 2013 and the 2011 STECF DCF effort data received and compiled in 2012. While the fisheries specific data on landings and nominal effort are found highly consistent, the ICES <b>estimates</b> <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> were consistently higher than the <b>estimates</b> <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> provided in the STECF data base. The pronounced differences in discard estimates are mainly due to different raising procedures applied and shall be further analysed in order to identify best and consistent practices applied to discard raising (section 4. 12). STECF EWG 13 - 06, in response to the general increased interest in discard estimates, has proposed an Index of Discard Coverage DQI to facilitate the use of the discard estimates provided in the STECF data bases on fisheries specific catch and fishing effort and obtained through the 2013 DCF data call. The DQI allows identification and avoidance of the use of discard estimates by fisheries based on the proportion of sums of national landings covered by discard estimates in relation to the overall sums of national landings. The method to derive the DQI and the interpretation of the results are provided in section 4. 5 of the present report.

40|$|Contributors: Dankert Skagen, Else TorstensenThe Herring Assessment Working Group (HAWG) met in ICES {{headquarters}} from 9 to 18 March 2004. The main {{terms of}} reference were to assess the status of and to provide catch options for the North Sea autumn-spawning herring stock in ICES Division IIIa, Sub-area IV and Division VIId, the herring stocks in Division VIa and Subarea VII, the stock of spring-spawning herring in Division IIIa and Subdivisions 22 - 24 (Western Baltic), and the sprat stocks in Sub-area IV and Divisions IIIa and VIId,e. The WG reports {{on the status of}} all of the stocks (8 herring and 3 sprat stocks). Analytical assessments were only carried out on 4 out of the 11 stocks the WG was requested to examine and of these four analytical assessments of only three of the herring stocks were accepted last year. This year the working group adopted the proposed ACFM methodology of allocating assessments to categories (The Benchmark - Update assessment system). Of the different stocks to be considered by the HAWG, the NSAS-stock was on the Observation list, the WBSS was to have a benchmark assessment and herring in VIa, VIIa, Celtic and sprat update assessments. During the progress of the work, the WG agreed to redefine the assessment of WBSS stock into an update assessment as no new relevant information was available and the assessments on Irish Sea herring, herring in VIaS, VIIb and sprat in the North Sea, as experimental assessments. The other stocks were considered as update assessments. For Irish Sea herring, an additional two-stage biomass model was used to assist exploration of the stock dynamics. The assessments of the autumn spawners in the North Sea, VIaN and the Western Baltic spring spawners (WBSS), are consistent with those presented last year, resulting in little changes in the perception of the stocks. With regard to the model used for the assessment of all herring stocks, namely ICA, concern has been raised about the instability in the selection patterns at older ages which would affect the stock estimates {{in the early part of}} the time series. The WG examined the performance of ICA on North Sea herring and Western Baltic Spring Spawners with another regularly used assessment model, XSA. The two models gave very similar perceptions of the state of the stock and the WG felt that the use of the ICA model is still appropriate. This also maintains consistency with assessments in previous years. Most of the stocks assessed are considered within safe biological limits. Corresponding catch predictions are provided in options tables for 2005, where possible by fleet. A number of data revisions have been applied to the assessment input data set for North Sea and WBSS at this year’s WG, as total catch and catch-at-age have been updated for the catch years 1995 - 2002. The catch series for West of Scotland (ViaN) herring were extended back to 1957, with no changes in the perception of the status of the stock compared to the 2003 -assessment for the years 1976 - 2002. There is still a need for better input/sampling data for some stocks, and in other stocks there is a lack of fishery independent data. Though few <b>estimates</b> <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> were available, the amount of discards for most fisheries was regarded as insignificant. The Stock Annexes of the Quality Control Handbook have been drafted and are attached to the HAWG report. In many cases these are incomplete as there is a large amount of information needed for each and they take a considerable amount of time to compile. For stocks without an accepted assessment, general elements (stock definitions, fisheries and ecosystem aspects) are presented. For VIaN herring, the inclusion of the longer time-series of catches including a period with higher stock productivity and higher biomass, resulted in the WG reviewing the support for the proposed reference points for that stock. The WG considered that the proposed Blim of 50, 000 t and a Bpa of 75, 000 t are suitable limits and reference points. The management arrangement for North Sea herring, adopted in 1998 by EU and Norway, was largely based on medium-term simulations made in 1997. Since this is 7 years ago, and the management regime only became effective recently, the WG found it appropriate to reinvestigate the harvest control rules with new simulations. The simulations and the results are presented in the report. Two formal requests from the EU-Commission to advise on TACs for herring in the Skagerrak/Kattegat-area, were considered by the HAW...|$|E

A {{large proportion of the}} fish caught in the Clyde is discarded, the <b>discards</b> mainly consisting <b>of</b> small demersal fish (mean length about 19 cm), particularly young whiting (Merlangius merlangus). Within the study period, annual <b>estimates</b> <b>of</b> total fish <b>discards</b> ranged from 318 to 3 027 tonnes, with a mean of 1 761 tonnes. Fish landings and discards biomass per unit effort both decreased over the study period. However, the decline in landings per unit effort was greater than that in discards per unit effort, corresponding to an increase in the discard rate over time. In recent years, discards have comprised about 70 % of the fish bycatch. The mean length <b>of</b> <b>discarded</b> fish was positively related to mesh size. © 2001 Ifremer/CNRS/Inra/IRD/Cemagref/Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SA...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} presents sampling levels {{obtained with}} Portuguese and Spanish Discard Sampling Programmes, both included in National Sampling Programmes, and some preliminary {{results for the}} Iberian Southern Hake discards. These programs consist on onboard-observer sampling schemes, with co-operative vessels, quasirandom selected, in the ICES Division VIIIc and IXa. The methodology used to estimate hake discards for Portugal and Spain since 2003 {{was based on the}} one proposed in the “Workshop on Discard Sampling Methodology and Raising Procedures” (PGCCDBS, Denmark, 2003). Spain presents results for the years 1994, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2003 and 2004. In the Portuguese Program, 2004 is the first year with an analysis <b>of</b> <b>discard</b> data. The number of trips sampled by the Spanish program for 2004 was 53, distributed by three trawl fleets- BACA trawl, Pair trawl and WHVO trawl. Portuguese onboard-observers sampled 40 trips distributed by Crustacean and Fish trawl fleets. The <b>estimated</b> percentages <b>of</b> <b>discarded</b> hake in relation to total catch were of 19, 9 (C. V. = 22. 6 %) and 46, 7 (C. V. = 72. 1 %) for the Spanish and Portuguese fleets respectively. The confidence interval for the Portuguese discard estimate is very large which denotes the very low precision of the obtained value. A co-operation in the analysis of this kind of data, between the two countries, could be the next step, since a standardisation of the methods would be of great importance for a realistic comparison of results obtained from both programs...|$|R

40|$|A Spanish Discard Sampling Programme {{is being}} carried out in Divisions VIIIc and IXa North since 1993. The series {{provides}} information on discarded catch in weight and number and length distributions for Southem hake. Spanish sampling was used for years 1994, 1997, 1999 - 2000 and 2003 - 2007. The number of trips sampled by the Spanish program was distributed by three trawl fleets: Baca otter trawl, Pair trawl and HVO trawl. Effort (trips number), hake landings and target species landings were the three variables tested to raise the Spanish discard, and the total effort by fleet gave the best results and hence {{it was used to}} estimate total discards. Hake discards for the Spanish fleet were estimated to vary between 240 t (C. V. = 22. 3) and 2 650 t (C.

We have attempted to model the fishermen’s behaviour using data collected by an observer on board fishing vessels. This enabled us to <b>estimate</b> the amounts <b>of</b> <b>discards,</b> which were added to the catches landed, collected by ISMAR-CNR Ancona. Discards were calculated for the period 1987 - 1999, as their values were negligible before 1987. Stock assessment on the entire data series from 1975 - 1999 was carried out by means of Virtual Population Analysis (VPA). Discarding behaviour differs among ports due to different local customs and market conditions. The quantity added to the annual total catch ranged from 900 tonnes to 4000 tonnes, corresponding to between 2 % and 15 % of the total corrected catch. VPAs indicated that mid-year sardine stock biomass rose steadily from 400, 000 tonnes in 1975 to a peak of 950, 000 tonnes in 1984. Subsequently, biomass declined steadily to the more recent values, around 300, 000 tonnes.

To <b>estimate</b> the <b>discards</b> <b>of</b> {{commercial}} and non-commercial species, including pinnipeds, cetaceans, sea turtles and sea birds, incidentally caught by different fishing gears of the Spanish fleets in ICES Divisions. 2. To <b>estimate</b> <b>of</b> {{the total volume}} and/or number discarded by fleet in each ICES Division by scaling-up {{the results of the}} sampling programme using data on the fishing effort. 3. To obtain the size composition of the most significant species <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> <b>of</b> different fisheries unit. 4. To evaluate of the causes <b>of</b> <b>discard</b> procedures per fleet. 5. To evaluate {{of the impact of the}} fishing activity in each fishery unit in relation to the total biomass catches. Methodologies : A discard sampling programme, taking place during the year 1994, was applied based on stratified random sampling by fisheries unit. Fishing gears used were, Trawl, Long Line, Gill Net, and Purse Seine in the ICES Subareas: VI, VII, VIII and IX. <b>Discards</b> volume <b>of</b> all taxa, including target species and low or noncommercial interest species including marine mammals, marine reptiles and sea birds, were sampled and quantified by observers on board commercial Spanish fishing vessels. Results: In 1994 by-catches of marine mammals and sea turtles were no J recorded during the sampling period, and only 5 sea bird by-catches were seen by the observers.. The comparison of the fleets regarding their ratios <b>of</b> <b>discards,</b> in 1994 by Spanish fleets, shows that the larger percentages <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> relative to the total catches are produced in the trawler fisheries (about 35 to 59 %). Conversely, purse seining in Division IXa and Subdivision Vlllc west show the lowest discard rates (1 to 6 %). Long line (8 to 18 %) gill net (25 %) and purse seiners in Subdivision Vlllc East and Division Vlllb (4 to 30 %) have asome intermediate amount <b>of</b> <b>discards).</b> If we analyze the results <b>of</b> total <b>discards</b> made by the fleet, it is trawling which produces the highest discard values (11 155 to 28 006 n, whereas gill net and purse seine In Divisions Vlllc and IXa produces a low volume (146 to 321 t). Total discard estimations for long lining and purse seiners in Subdivision Vlllc East and Division Vlllb show asome intermediate discard values (503 to 5 788 t) The reasons for discarding in 1994 produced by the Spanish fleet were basically: - the lack of commercial interest in many of the species caught, - the length of the trips which mean that it is not possible to maintain certain species on board, - the Spanish fleet's lack of quota for fishing certain species in certain zones, - the size of the individuals caught being below the minimum legal size and/or below the size with a commercial value, - individuals which deteriorate during the fishing process, - the hold capacity of the vessel which means that discards are produced, particularly in the case of purse seining and trawling in coastal areas, - the economic demands or decisions (marked fall in price due to the abundance <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> on certain days), - in low commercial value species, when the haul catch is very low, this species is discarded. Data from this study will be made available to ICES Working Groups on Assessment of Southern Self Demersal Stocks for Hake Megrim and Monks, on Assessment of Mackerel, Horse Mackerel, Sardine and Anchovy, on Assessment of Blue Whiting and in the Study Group on the Biology and Assessment of Deep-Sea Fisheries Resources...|$|R
