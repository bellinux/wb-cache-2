25|$|In 1994, the new 24-hour {{radio station}} Time Highway Radio {{proved to be}} {{competition}} to RTM's existing radio stations. Hence RTM decided to re-brand Radio 4, and brought in new DJs such as Patrick and Yasmin Yusoff. Patrick's talk show slot was from 9 a.m. until 12 noon Mondays to Wednesdays. When Radio 4 went for 24-hour broadcast, Patrick also hosted a show in the 12 a.m. until 3 a.m. slot called 'Midnight Magic'. In Midnight Magic Patrick invited listeners to call <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> ghost stories, a move {{that proved to be}} a hit among his listeners.|$|E

25|$|We want {{every man}} and woman in these two {{counties}} to recall the dates of these murders and also to recall whether or not any person close to them was missing or out of pocket during those nights. Persons who have such information and have been withholding it when they know they should report it are leaving themselves open to possible charges of complicity in event the slayer is captured. Make no mistake {{about the fact that}} the slayer will be captured because we will not give up this hunt until he has been captured or killed. All information received will be treated confidentially. We urge you to come <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> what you know. Don't be hesitant or fear that you are causing an innocent man embarrassment and trouble in as much all investigation will be confidential. This is no time to take any chance on information which might lead us to the slayer. This maniac must be captured. We believe that we are justified in going to any ends to halt this chain of murder. Bear in mind--this killer may strike at any one. He may strike at persons close to him. For that reason, we believe any person with information that may lead us to the murderer should act in the interest of self-preservation.|$|E

2500|$|While on Liveline, Williams denied {{attempting}} {{to link the}} Republican movement with the criminal underworld. This prompted several people, whom Williams had linked to crime in his articles, to phone <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> Joe Duffy that Williams was always making false allegations against them. Williams attempted to deflect the questions by focusing on their time spent in prison and implying that they had therefore lost any right to a reputation. In 2010, Williams contradicted himself by telling an audience that the Republican movement was linked with organised crime, so much so, he claimed, somewhat uncertainly, that 1969 was [...] "probably the last truly peaceful year in this nation of ours. That", he said, [...] "changed with the escalation of problems in Northern Ireland." ...|$|E

2500|$|Arklöv {{was arrested}} {{a short time}} after the {{fighting}} ceased and was accused of war crimes, including torturing pregnant Bosniak prisoners in concentration camps in Gabela camp, Dretelj camp and Grabovina. The crimes were severe and he had, among other things, forced a woman to say [...] "Allah akbar" [...] before shoving his rifle into her mouth, whipped prisoners with a Waffen-SS belt, abused and tortured pregnant girls, as well as having beaten young men and broken their arms and legs. Prisoners in the camps called Arklöv [...] "the black devil" [...] because of his black fascist uniform and skin-colour. When civilians were forced under torture to humiliate themselves by Arklöv but didn't obey him, other guards would step <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> the victims to [...] "do as he says, or he'll kill you, he is totally insane" [...] and laugh. Arklöv was seen talking to camp commander Bosko Previsic (known as [...] "Boko") before and after tortures. Some inmates was forced to hold their fingers apart or stick their tongues out while {{on the ground in}} a shed and then get hit with metal objects so hard that the skin between their fingers and their tongues would split.|$|E

Regina and Robin show up and they look at her pregnant body, which has accelerated by seven months (from two months), a result of Emma's dark magic. Zelena is {{rushed to the hospital}} and says that Emma did this with her onion rings. Dr. Whale is there and Zelena says tells him to get her [...] "angry baby" [...] out, and Whale reminds her about the last baby he delivered, which she tried to steal. He then mocks her, telling her that she must have realized that having a baby was so much more fun than stealing one. Regina asks why his hair is blonde and spiked, with Dr. Whale replying that since Emma changed her hairstyle, he though he could do the same as well. As Dr. Whale continues to joke about Zelena, Regina mutters that they [...] "really need a new doctor in this town." [...] Belle and Mary Margaret rush <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> them that Emma is coming for the baby, and that the only thing she needs other than Excalibur to snuff out the light are the cries of a newborn child. Zelena begs Regina to take off the cuff so she can defend herself and her baby, but Regina says no. Zelena immediately delivers a baby girl, as Regina and Mary Margaret wait in the hall. Mary asks if Regina is ready to meet her new family, but she says she doesn’t know. As Robin hold the newborn, Emma appears, throwing Whale against the wall yet again. Robin and Regina prepare to fight her, but Emma reveals that she wants Zelena instead, and disappears with her.|$|E
