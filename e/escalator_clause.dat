25|$|Although the 1970s in Italy {{was marked}} by violence, {{it was also a}} time of great social and {{economic}} progress. Following the civil disturbances of the 1960s, Christian Democracy and its allies in government (including the PSI) introduced a wide range of political, social, and economic reforms. Regional governments were introduced in the spring of 1970, with elected councils provided with the authority to legislate in areas like public works, town planning, social welfare, and health. Spending on the relatively poor South was significantly increased, while new laws relating to index-linked pay, public housing, and pension provision were also passed. In 1975, a law was passed entitling redundant workers to receive at least 80% of their previous salary for up to a year from a state insurance fund. Living standards also continued to rise, with wages going up by an average of about 25% a year from the early 1970s onwards, and between 1969 and 1978, average real wages rose by 72%. Various fringe benefits were raised {{to the extent that they}} amounted to an additional 50% to 60% on wages, the highest in any country in the Western world. In addition, working hours were reduced so that by the end of the decade they were lower than any other country apart from Belgium. Some categories of workers who were laid off received generous unemployment compensation which represented only a little less than full wages, often years beyond eligibility. Initially, these benefits were primarily enjoyed by industrial workers in northern Italy where the “Hot Autumn” had its greatest impact, but these benefits soon spread to other categories of workers in other areas. In 1975, the <b>escalator</b> <b>clause</b> was strengthened in wage contracts, providing a high proportion of workers with nearly 100% indexation, with quarterly revisions, thereby increasing wages nearly as fast as prices.|$|E

Despite this, the state does not seem more dispute-prone than other states when California’s unionization rate is taken into account.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} union wage contracts in the persistence of inflation, and the implication of these contracts for the problem of disinflation in the United States. A quantitative model of overlapping con- tracts explicitly oriented toward the major union sector is developed.

In addition, the distribution of workers according to contract length as well as deferred wage increases and <b>escalator</b> <b>clauses</b> are explicitly used in the model. The main aim of the model is to determine the constraints which these contracts impose on disinflation paths. The model indicates that the maximum speed of disinflation is extremely slow in the early phases [...] if a rise in unemployment is to be avoided [...] but increases considerably before the new lower rate of inflation is reached. The disinflation path is considerably slower than that observed after hyperinflation periods. However, the existence of a path of inflation reduction raises questions about whether the institution of union wage con- tracts is really the direct cause of costly disinflations, or whether their influence works indirectly by raising credibility problems about a monetary disinflation. ...|$|R
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the First World War, the Washington Naval Treaty was drawn up in 1922 in an effort to stop an arms race developing between Britain, Japan, France, Italy and the United States. This treaty limited the number of ships each nation was allowed to build and capped the displacement of all capital ships at 35,000 long tons. These restrictions were extended in 1930 through the London Naval Treaty, however, in 1935 Japan and Italy would not agree to the Second London Naval Treaty for further armament control.

2500|$|The King George V and {{the four}} other ships of the class as built carried ten BL 14 inch Mk VII naval guns, in two quadruple turrets fore and aft and a single twin turret behind and above the fore turret. There was debate within the Admiralty over the choice of gun calibre; though there was little or no debate within Parliament; other European powers {{preferred}} 15-inch, and the USN, 16-inch main guns. Initially the Admiralty studied vessels armed {{with a variety of}} differing main armament layouts including nine [...] guns in three turrets, two forward and one aft. While this was well within the capabilities of the British shipyards, the design was quickly rejected as they felt compelled to adhere to the Second London Naval Treaty signed in 1936, and there was a serious shortage of skilled technicians and ordnance designers, along with compelling pressures to reduce weight. As a result, the class was designed to carry twelve 14-inch guns in three quadruple turrets and this configuration had a heavier broadside than the nine 15-inch guns. Unfortunately, it proved impossible to include this amount of firepower and the desired level of protection on a 35,000ton displacement, and the weight of the superimposed quadruple turret brought the stability of the vessel into question. In the end, the second forward turret was changed to a smaller two gun turret in exchange for better armour protection, reducing the broadside weight to below that of the nine gun arrangement. The 14-inch Armour Piercing (AP) shell also carried a very large bursting charge of [...] The armour-piercing capability of the gun and its ammunition is exhibited by the conning tower on the wreck of the German battleship Bismarck, provided with 14-inch thick armour, which is said to resemble a [...] "Swiss cheese".

Evidence on money illusion and sticky prices, and evidence from countries (notably Chile) that have created indexed units of account, suggests that creating such indexed units is an important policy option for governments in countries with unstable prices or incomes. Choices for governments designing indexed units of account are discussed. Governments may choose to encourage the use of the units only for large long-deferred non-wage payments, or they may choose to go to the opposite extreme of encouraging the use of the units for defining all prices, wages and payments. A general equilibrium model is given that shows the dynamics of prices when all prices are expressed in the units. Governments may choose to link units to a consumer price index or to a per capita income index, and there may be advantages to creating both kinds of units simultaneously. Downward rigidity of real wages might be reduced if wages are denominated in base-income-indexed units of account, where base income is defined so that the growth rate in money value of the unit is biased down relative to actual per capita income growth.

40|$|Le but de cet article est de décrire l'effet de l'inflation sur les salaires réels, de décrire les principes théoriques régissant la mise sur pied de contrats qui prévoient les indemnités de taux de salaires en termes réels et d'examiner la {{relation}} entre ces principes et leur application aux conventions collectives. The {{purpose of}} this article is to describe the effect of inflation on real wages, to describe the theoretical principles involved in designing contracts that provide wage rate benefits in real terms, and to examine the relation between these principles and their application to collective agreements. Available evidence indicates that one result of rapidly rising consumer prices during 1972 and 1973 was to produce negligible changes in real wages even though money wage rates were rising relatively rapidly. Two basic approaches to negotiating acceptable money wage increases designed to take account of inflation are commonly used. In the first approach union negotiators estimate expected rates of inflation over the life of the contract and determine the amount of money wage increase necessary to neutralize the effectof increased prices on purchasing power. To this amount, they then add money wage demands sufficient to achieve hoped for increases in real wages. In the second approach wage rates are indexed to a consumer price index series so that a rise in the index automatically results in the adjustment of worker's earnings. These arrangements are known as cost of living allowance (COLA) or escalator clauses. C. P. I. Indexes and the Principle of Maintaining the Real Value of Money Wages. In order to correctly estimate an expected change in the C. P. I. or to properly utilize a C. P. I. in a COLA formula it must be decided whether it is real wage rates that are being examined between two specificpoints in time or whether it is average real wage rates being examined between twoperiods of time. Use of the C. P. I. Index Front One Specific Date to Another. If prices increase steadily throughout the year at a rate of 12 percent per year, money wage rates should increase steadily throughout the year at the same rate. Use of the Annual Average Consumer Price Index. The annual average method is equivalent to asking how much prices were higher in each month in 1973 as compared to the same month in 1972 and to average these increases. The use of the average annual method is appropriate for the case where it is theaverage real wage rate of the base period that should be protected. In this case, the real wage rate was not constant during the base period but was declining as prices were rising. The Use of a Cost of Living Allowance or <b>Escalator</b> <b>Clause</b> to Maintain the Real Value of Wage Rates. It is not practical to adjust money wages as soon as prices change and consequently wage adjustments can be made with a lag by using some formula relating increases in the C. P. I. to increases in money wage rates. Workers will have been paying higher prices for some time before their money wage rate is adjusted. There is a loss in real wages due to this lag as compared to the case where real wages are kept constant by increasing money wages as soon as prices increase.
