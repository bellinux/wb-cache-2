You have to turn this into music. You have to try, at least. I was so embarrassed by just everything. I just didn’t {{want to be that}} person that just went down after all of that. A lot of the time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write. They were giving me tracks and doing it all. I was like, Why am I here? Then I got the perfect {{combination}} of people to really support me and make me feel confident. It was an amazing awakening. I walked into the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E

Because I {{would be ready to}} go onstage and just be crying hysterically not understanding even how <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> very dizzy, I had a lot of vertigo, I had pain but it's like fuck if I know what hurts the most because I'd been on tour for a year. But I didn't want to let them down and I just couldn't cancel because the thought of leaving 50,000 kids in the arena just broke my heart. So I went out every night and I played and I played and I played until I couldn't walk one night." ...|$|E

500|$|Tarwater {{was devastated}} by the trial results, later saying, [...] "It was the most empty feeling in the world." [...] He went home to Knoxville to reflect on {{swimming}} and life in general. He told his parents {{that he could not}} stand hearing coverage of the Olympics, so his father quickly organized a vacation to Costa Rica. After returning home, Tarwater's uncle, Richmond Flowers Jr., was able to help him through the experience. [...] In 1968, Flowers had been a gold medal favorite in the hurdles before suffering a hamstring injury two months before the Olympic Trials. [...] "I think he knew the pain <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> and the disappointment <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling,</b> because he felt same thing," [...] Tarwater recalled. Flowers offered perspective, instead of comfort: [...] "I believe there is a God who created this, and it ain't no accident. [...] He's got a plan... maybe it just wasn't the right thing for you." [...] Soon after, Tarwater met pastor Doug Banister of All Souls Church in Knoxville. After several [...] "really tough conversions" [...] with Banister, Tarwater decided to [...] " [...] life to Christ and basically relinquished control." ...|$|E
500|$|Kiedis wrote {{much of the}} song's lyrics {{during a}} period when he felt distraught and emotionally drained. He had {{maintained}} sobriety for roughly three years and felt that this had distanced him from his bandmates. While the group worked on Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Frusciante and Flea often smoked marijuana together, ignoring Kiedis, who felt that Frusciante was [...] "no longer in [...] world." [...] Driving home after rehearsal in April 1991, Kiedis thought of his heroin and cocaine addiction during his relationship with former girlfriend Ione Skye: [...] "the loneliness that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> triggered memories of my time with Ione and how I'd had this beautiful angel of {{a girl who was}} willing to give me all of her love, and instead of embracing that, I was downtown with fucking gangsters shooting speedballs under a bridge." ...|$|E

500|$|The most {{distinctive}} part of Raonic's game is his powerful and accurate serve, from which his [...] "Missile" [...] nickname is derived. He is frequently cited as {{having one of}} the best serves among his contemporaries, along with Karlović and Isner. Some consider Raonic's serve to be among the best of all time. Sampras, Raonic's childhood idol, describes the Canadian's serve as [...] "bigger than big." [...] After a match against Raonic, Djokovic commented [...] "I can't recall the last time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> so helpless returning. Even his second serve." [...] Women's tennis player Serena Williams has said that [...] "If she could take one thing from another player, it would be Milos Raonic's serve." [...] Statistically, Raonic is among the strongest servers in the Open Era, winning 91% of service games to rank third all-time. Raonic has one of the fastest recorded serves of all time.|$|E
500|$|The album's themes {{revolve around}} events {{which took place}} in 2015, such as the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and the British media's {{handling}} of the United Kingdom general election, {{as well as on the}} state of humanity. Lead writer Higgs spent a year writing the album, time he spent watching rolling news and enveloping himself in current events. Pritchard told the London Evening Standard that [...] "we're in an age where we're more conscious of [...] you're constantly bombarded by information". Speaking to Chris Parkin of Red Bull, Higgs explained the songwriting process provided a kind of catharsis following the year's events: [...] "It wasn't until after we finished that I looked back and thought, bloody hell, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> that very heavily and I didn't realise until it was out of me." [...] He later described the album as a [...] "horror bible".|$|E
500|$|Refn chose Johnny Jewel of Desire and the Chromatics {{to score}} the film. He wanted {{electronic}} music {{and to have}} it be abstract, on occasion, so viewers can see things from the Driver's perspective. As Refn was going through mixer Jewel's catalog, he picked out [...] "Under Your Spell" [...] and [...] "Tick of the Clock" [...] because he thought of Drive being a fairy tale. During Drives climax, [...] "A Real Hero"'s keynote melody, about becoming [...] "a real human being, and a real hero", refrains because that is when the Driver displays both those characteristics. At first, Jewel worried that [...] "Under Your Spell" [...] might be too literal, but soon realized it is used in Drive [...] "in the exact same way that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> it when I wrote it. He definitely got the nuance of the song, and understood what {{it was supposed to}} mean, and he wanted to give that emotion to the viewer, that same feeling." ...|$|E

500|$|For {{the first}} time since 1997, the Fugees {{performed}} in September 2004 at Dave Chappelle's Block Party in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. The concert featured Hill's nearly a cappella rendition of [...] "Killing Me Softly". The event was recorded by director Michel Gondry and was released on March 3, 2006, to universal acclaim. The Fugees also appeared at BET Awards 2005 during June 2005, where they opened the show with a 12-minute set. One track, [...] "Take It Easy", was leaked online and thereafter was released as an Internet single in late September. It peaked at number forty on the Billboard R Chart. In 2005, she told USA Today, [...] "If I make music now, it will only be to provide information to my own children. If other people benefit from it, then so be it." [...] When asked how she now felt about the songs on 2.0, she stated [...] "a lot of the songs were transitional. The music was about how <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> at the time, even though I was documenting my distress as well as my bursts of joy." ...|$|E
500|$|After Tuesday Night Music Club, Crow {{wanted to}} prove her {{authority}} as a musician. According to her, [...] "My only objective on this record was to get under people's skin, because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> like I had so much shit to hurl at the tape." [...] Work on the new album began at Toad Hall in Pasadena, California, the same studio where Tuesday Night Music Club was recorded, but sessions were soon relocated to New Orleans, Louisiana because Crow [...] "was feeling ghosts in that room". Bottrell was designated to produce the record and co-wrote three songs that would appear on the album, but eventually left {{because he could not}} sort out his differences with Crow. As a result, Crow took over production duties and wrote most of the songs alone or with only one collaborator. She also played most of the instruments on the album, including bass and guitar work and nearly all the keyboard parts. Most of the album was recorded at Kingsway Studio in New Orleans, although Crow would later return to Los Angeles to complete work at The Sound Factory and Sunset Sound. Audio mastering took place at Gateway Mastering Studios in Portland, Maine.|$|E
500|$|The {{frontman}} {{was more}} involved in the composition of Born Villain than he was for preceding records. Manson has said that this is a result of him beginning the project with a different mindset from that of his chief collaborator, Twiggy. He said he developed a [...] "clear idea" [...] of the album's direction early in its writing stages, which he was reluctant to share {{with other members of the}} band. He worked on the album in a minimally decorated apartment located above a liquor store in Downtown Los Angeles, which was once owned by actor Billy Zane and was the site where Manson created his first painting in 1996. The album contains seven songs which feature the vocalist as a composer, including three where he is listed as the sole writer. At the time of the album's release, Manson distanced himself from the approach he took when creating previous albums, explaining: [...] "On the last two records I made, I was trying to make people feel what I was feeling—which wasn't a good idea, because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> like shit. Check mark number one: don't make records that make people feel bad." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{releasing}} {{her third}} studio album Artpop, Gaga held a private event in New York known as ArtRave, where she performed {{songs from the}} album and showcased art pieces. Later, she took the concept of ArtRave and created ArtRave: The Artpop Ball tour. After abruptly cancelling the North American leg of her previous Born This Way Ball (2012–13) tour due to a major hip injury, the tour began with its first leg in the United States on May 4, 2014, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. ArtRave: The Artpop Ball had the singer visiting cities where she canceled tour dates in order to undergo the surgery, as well as playing new cities. Gaga explained to The Independent: [...] "When I'm onstage with the Artpop Ball, {{the point of the}} show is to take what was the mess of my life and make art of it – to raise the spirit of artistic dreams and creativity and take all the things <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> in pain about, and rage... I take a much more meditative approach to the performance. I've got wide-open ears. The ArtRave has routines, and there's a performance-art aspect that has been designed." [...] Prior {{to the beginning of the}} tour, Gaga headlined six shows (March 28, 30, 31 and April 2, 4, and 6) at the Roseland Ballroom in Manhattan, New York, and these shows were the final performances at the venue. A seventh show was also added for April 7 and officially closed the venue.|$|E

2500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} between 22 March and 26 July 1994 at Master Rock Studios, Kilburn, London. The rehearsals were very tense and would inevitably split the band into two separate camps. Butler {{had his own}} agenda and he frequently clashed {{with the rest of}} the band and producer Ed Buller, who he had concerns with during the recording of the first album. Butler seemed to antagonise his separation further when he appeared on the front cover of Vox magazine with the tag line, [...] "Brett drives me insane." [...] The interview explained how Butler liked to improvise and how Anderson made this impossible because of his slow ways of working, and his obsession with rock stardom. A despondent Anderson remembers reading the article the same morning he was recording the vocals for [...] "The Asphalt World": [...] "I remember trying to channel all this hurt that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> and the iciness <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> into the vocal." [...] Butler later apologised to Anderson over the incident. Musical differences over [...] "The Asphalt World" [...] triggered the next dispute. The version that made it on to the album clocks in at nine minutes 25 seconds, but according to bass player Mat Osman, Butler's initial creation was a 25-minute piece with an eight-minute guitar solo.|$|E
2500|$|Adele {{revealed}} {{that she was}} struggling emotionally when she composed it: [...] "When I was writing it <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> pretty miserable and pretty lonely, which I guess kind of contradicts 'Rolling in the Deep'. Whereas that was about me saying, 'I'm {{going to be fine}} without you', this is me on my knees really." [...] She discussed further the inspiration of the song: [...] "I can imagine being about 40 and looking for him again, only to turn up and find that he's settled with a beautiful wife and beautiful kids and he's completely happy... and I'm still on my own. The song's about that and I'm scared at the thought of that." ...|$|E

"Place de la République" [...] is a slow, [...] "melancholy" [...] {{song with}} a similar sound to Martin's debut album, {{featuring}} her vocals with a piano and an [...] "emotive" [...] and [...] "subdued chamber-pop string adornment". Its name comes from the public square {{of the same name}} in Paris. Written almost immediately after the release of her first album, Martin said that it [...] "became a symbol for whatever <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> afterwards ... It was defining for me". After adding it to her regular performance repertoire, the song was well known by Martin's fans and became a catalyst for Blonde; as Martin stated during an interview on the radio show Q: ...|$|E
