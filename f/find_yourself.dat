50|$|Her {{first three}} books were spiritual memoirs {{describing}} her experiences in contemplative Christianity, the last {{telling the story}} of her journey from traditional Christianity to feminist theology. God’s Joyful Surprise: <b>Finding</b> <b>Yourself</b> Loved (Harper SanFrancisco, 1988) is focused on abandoning a hopeless quest for perfection and accepting one is loved as one is. When the Heart Waits: Spiritual Direction for Life's Sacred Questions (Harper SanFrancisco, 1990) tells of her painful midlife crisis. Finally, The Dance of the Dissident Daughter: A Woman's Journey from Christian Tradition to the Sacred Feminine (Harper SanFrancisco, 1996), discussed her encounter with women's spirituality.|$|R

500|$|Bridge {{impressed}} on Britten {{the importance}} of scrupulous attention to the technical craft of composing and the maxim that [...] "you should <b>find</b> <b>yourself</b> and be true to what you found." [...] The earliest substantial works Britten composed while studying with Bridge are the String Quartet in F, completed in April 1928, and the Quatre Chansons Françaises, a song-cycle for high voice and orchestra. Authorities differ {{on the extent of}} Bridge's influence on his pupil's technique. Humphrey Carpenter and Michael Oliver judge that Britten's abilities as an orchestrator were essentially self-taught; Donald Mitchell considers that Bridge had an important influence on the cycle.|$|E

500|$|In April 2010, Rowling {{published}} an article in The Times, in which she criticised Cameron's plan to encourage married couples to stay together by offering them a £150 annual tax credit: [...] "Nobody who has ever experienced the reality of poverty could say 'it's not the money, it's the message'. When your flat has been broken into, and you cannot afford a locksmith, it is the money. When you are two pence short of a tin of baked beans, and your child is hungry, it is the money.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Daily Telegraph Madonna further explained her inspiration behind the song and stated that [...] " [...] a song most people who work can relate to.

500|$|Christopher Monfette of IGN {{also gave}} the film a {{positive}} review, saying [...] "This is an adult's {{interpretation of a}} childhood phenomenon, and if you're willing {{to give it a}} shot, one suspects that you'll <b>find</b> <b>yourself</b> entertained enough to give your best, [...] "Yo, Joe!" [...] He gave the film three and a half out of five stars. Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times criticized the excessive flashbacks, but praised the action scenes and design, and considered that Marlon Wayans [...] "steals the show". Dan Kois of The Washington Post describing it as [...] "loudest, flashiest, silliest and longest blockbuster in a summer full of long, silly, flashy, loud blockbusters" [...] thought it was [...] "as polished and entertaining as war-mongering toy commercials get".|$|E

500|$|Fuseli's other Macbeth Woodmason {{painting}} Macbeth and the Armed Head {{depicts a}} later {{scene in which}} Macbeth is shown MacDuff and warned {{to be wary of}} him. Fuseli evidently intended the two paintings to be juxtaposed. He said, [...] "when Macbeth meets with the witches on the heath, it is terrible, because he did not expect the supernatural visitation; but when he goes to the cave to ascertain his fate, it is no longer a subject of terror." [...] Fuseli chose to make MacDuff a near-likeness of Macbeth himself, and considered the painting one of his most poetic in that sense, asking, [...] "'What would be a greater object of terror to you if, some night on going home, you were to <b>find</b> <b>yourself</b> sitting at your own table [...] [...] [...] would not this make a powerful impression on your mind?" ...|$|E
500|$|The actor {{was more}} {{successful}} in 2006 with his role opposite Jamie Foxx in Michael Mann's action crime drama, Miami Vice. The film grossed $164million worldwide on a budget of $135million, and TimeOut New York ranked it among the top 50 movies of the decade. (The DVD, released the same year, also managed to sell over a million copies (equivalent to $7.91 million in pirated versions) in its first week alone., and, as of 11 February 2007, had grossed over $36.45million in rentals. A. O. Scott criticised Farrell's work: [...] "When he's not on screen, you don't miss him, and when he is, you <b>find</b> <b>yourself,</b> before long, looking at someone or something else." [...] Conversely, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was enthusiastic. The actor also reportedly took a slight pay cut to make friend and recent Oscar winner Jamie Foxx happy: His salary was initially larger than Foxx's.|$|E
500|$|Farmer {{recorded}} {{only twice}} with Horace Silver's group, as Silver recorded for Blue Note Records, while Farmer was signed to Prestige. Feuds between the label bosses ruled out extensive cross-label collaboration. The transition from Silver's piano-led quintet to Mulligan's piano-less quartet was not straightforward: [...] "to suddenly <b>find</b> <b>yourself</b> in a pianoless group was like {{walking down the}} street naked", commented Farmer. As a member of Mulligan's band, Farmer appeared on film twice – in I Want to Live! (1958) and The Subterraneans (1960) – and again toured Europe, as part of a Jazz at the Philharmonic tour, helping him to develop an international reputation. In New York, Farmer worked with Lester Young, who told him to [...] "tighten up and tell a 'story' in each solo". At this time, Farmer also rented his trumpet on a nightly basis to Miles Davis, who had pawned his own due to his drug dependency.|$|E

500|$|The soundtrack {{was very}} well received. IGN called it a [...] "beautiful soundtrack that you'll <b>find</b> <b>yourself</b> {{listening}} to even after you're done with the game". SEMO said [...] "the compositions and performances are so good that listening to this album on a stand-alone basis can make people feel like they're in a bar back then". RPGFan said [...] "the pieces are beautifully composed, wonderfully played (...). has a stellar soundtrack with music that easily stands alone outside {{the context of the}} game. This CD was an absolute pleasure to listen to and comes highly recommended."

500|$|In addition, Firth watched archive {{footage of}} the King speaking. In an {{interview}} with Allan Tyrer published by the British Stammering Association, Swain said: [...] " [...] was very interesting while {{we were working on}} the film just to think tonally how far we could go and should go with the strength of George's stammer. I think a less courageous director than Tom [...] – and indeed a less courageous actor than Colin [...] – might have felt the need to slightly sanitise the degree and authenticity of that stammer, and I'm really really pleased that neither of them did." [...] In May 2011 Firth said he was finding traces of the stammer difficult to eliminate: [...] "You can probably hear even from this interview, there are moments when it’s quite infectious," [...] he said. [...] "You <b>find</b> <b>yourself</b> doing it and if I start thinking about it the worse it gets. If nothing else it’s an insight into what it feels like." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon release, {{the game}} was lauded by the video game press. It was widely {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the best games released for the NES. Computer and Video Games editors Paul Rand, Tim Boone and Frank O'Connor awarded the game a 98/100, praising it for its gameplay, replayability, sound, and graphics. Boone commented that the game is nearly flawless in its utterly [...] "stupendous incredibility and absolutely impossible to put down for anything less than a fire alarm – and even then you <b>find</b> <b>yourself</b> weighting down the odds." [...] Rand called Super Mario Bros. 3 the best video game ever, labeling it [...] "the Mona Lisa of gaming" [...] and stating that it is [...] "astoundingly brilliant in every way, shape and form."
