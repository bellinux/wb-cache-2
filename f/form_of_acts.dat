50|$|There are {{a number}} of formal differences, from one {{jurisdiction}} to another, {{in the manner in which}} constitutional amendments are both originally drafted and written down once they become law. In some jurisdictions, such as Ireland, Estonia, and Australia, constitutional amendments originate as bills and become laws in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>acts</b> of parliament. This may be the case notwithstanding the fact that a special procedure is required to bring an amendment into force. Thus, for example, in Ireland and Australia although amendments are drafted in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>Acts</b> of Parliament they cannot become law until they have been approved in a referendum. By contrast, in the United States a proposed amendment originates as a special joint resolution of Congress that does not require the President to sign and that the President can not veto.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In Vietnam, the artemisinin-based {{combination}} therapy (<b>ACT)</b> <b>of</b> dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is currently used for first-line treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. However, limited efficacy and tolerability {{data are available}} on alternative <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>ACT</b> in Vietnam in case there is {{a reduction in the}} susceptibility of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. A study was conducted to compare the efficacy and tolerability of two fixed-dose formulations <b>of</b> <b>ACT,</b> artemisinin–piperaquine (Artequick®, ARPQ) and artesunate-amodiaquine (Coarsucam™, ASAQ) for the treatment of P. falciparum malaria in south-central Vietnam. Methods A randomized, open-label trial was conducted comparing the efficacy of a two-day regimen of ARPQ (~ 2. 8 [*]mg/kg artemisinin plus ~ 17. 1 [*]mg/kg of piperaquine per day) and a three-day regimen of ASAQ (~ 4. 7 [*]mg/kg of artesunate plus ~ 12. 6 [*]mg/kg of amodiaquine per day) for the treatment of children and adults with uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Primary efficacy endpoint was day 42, PCR-corrected, parasitological cure rate. Secondary endpoints were parasite and fever clearance times and tolerability. Results Of 128 patients enrolled, 63 were administered ARPQ and 65 ASAQ. Of the patients who completed the 42 [*]days follow-up period or had a recurrence of malaria, 55 were on ARPQ (30 children, 25 adults) and 59 were on ASAQ (31 children, 28 adults). Recrudescent parasitaemia was PCR-confirmed for one patient in each treatment group, with cure rates at day 42 of 98 % (95 % CI: 88 – 100) for both <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>ACT.</b> The median parasite clearance time was significantly slower in the ARPQ group compared with the ASAQ group (48 [*]h vs. 36 [*]h, P vs. 24 [*]h, P [*]=[*] 0. 07). The two <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>ACT</b> were well tolerated with no serious adverse events. Conclusion Both <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>ACT</b> were highly efficacious in the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. Although the two-day course of ARPQ was equally as effective as the three-day course of ASAQ, parasite and fever clearance times were shorter with ASAQ. Further studies are warranted in different regions of Vietnam to determine the nationwide efficacy of ASAQ.

My thesis was called "A governing body acting beyond its powers".

Work has been divided into following main chapters. In the chapter dedicated to the basic terms I wrote about the definiton of governing body, the legal capacity of a legal person and character of governing body acting on behalf of the trade corporation, which is according to me sui generis.

Nonetheless, the law of languages profoundly touches upon concepts that are of capital social importance : culture, minority language rights and fundamental freedoms. Furthermore, the very object of linguistic legislation which of course is language, is per se an object that hardly lands itself to appropriation either linguistically or legally — and as a basic means for expressing legal thought, language simultanously is the subject and object of law dealing with meta-legal and meta-linguistic concepts. Lastly, there exist in Québec important restrictions of both a structural and operative nature that relate to the interpretation and enforcement of Quebec law on language usage. This is why the legal impact of language laws, in general, and Quebec law, in particular, is of minor importance, whereas the cultural impact is of major concern...|$|E

The principle of equality provided in Article 3 of the Constitution is generally not relied upon in civil actions although, theoretically, it could indeed be relied upon; however, reference to this principle of equality is quite often made by the Constitutional Court to verify the constitutional legitimacy of legislation. EU equality directives are normally implemented by legislative decrees. Such a Decree quite often repeats word for word the text of the Directive. The verbatim reproduction of directives in our system can be regarded as a bad practice: indeed, this does not ensure the necessary coordination with other existing provisions and does not promote knowledge of European legislation. In the field of gender equality case law plays only a marginal role, which could be both a cause and an effect of the merely formal implementation of directives. No recent and innovative case law can be recorded as regards equal treatment. There are only a few cases that have found that a dismissal on the ground of maternity was discriminatory. The majority of cases deal with maternity issues {{from the point of view}} of protection rights. Some cases also deal with the issue of sexual harassment, and particularly with the right of the victim to have non-patrimonial damages refunded. As regards local legislation, Article 117 of the Constitution provides for the boundary between the legislative powers of the State and those of the regions. The State has exclusive competence in the ‘determination of the basic standards of welfare relating to those civil and social rights that must be guaranteed in the entire national territory;’ Article 117 then states: ‘regional laws shall remove all obstacles which prevent the full equality of men and women in social, cultural and economic life, and shall promote equal access of men and women to elective office. ’ The regions can thus legislate on substantive equality and gender equalit...|$|E
