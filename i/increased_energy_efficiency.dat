25|$|In the {{assessed}} scenarios, {{economic growth}} is compatible with increasing or decreasing GHG emissions. In the latter case, emissions growth is mediated by <b>increased</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency,</b> shifts to non-fossil energy sources, and/or shifts to a post-industrial (service-based) economy. Most scenarios projecting rising GHGs also project low levels of government intervention in the economy.

25|$|When President Carter {{created the}} U.S. Department of Energy in 1977, {{one of their}} first {{successful}} projects was the Weatherization Assistance Program. During the last 30 years, this program has provided services to more than 5.5 million low-income families. On average, low-cost weatherization reduces heating bills by 31% and overall energy bills by $358 per year at current prices. <b>Increased</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> and weatherization spending has a high return on investment.|$|E
25|$|The {{public is}} also quite clear on its {{priorities}} {{when it comes}} to promoting energy conservation versus increasing the supply of oil, coal, and natural gas. When asked which of these should be the higher priority, the public chooses energy conservation by a very wide 68 percent-to-21 percent margin. The public also predominantly believes that the need to cut down on energy consumption and protect the environment means <b>increased</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> should be mandated for certain products. Ninety-two percent of Americans now support such requirements.|$|E
25|$|Coal {{fueled the}} {{industrial}} revolution in the 18th and 19th century. With {{the advent of the}} automobile, aeroplanes and the spreading use of electricity, oil became the dominant fuel during the twentieth century. The growth of oil as the largest fossil fuel was further enabled by steadily dropping prices from 1920 until 1973. After the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979, during which the price of oil increased from 5 to 45 US dollars per barrel, there was a shift away from oil. Coal, natural gas, and nuclear became the fuels of choice for electricity generation and conservation measures <b>increased</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency.</b> In the U.S. the average car more than doubled the number of miles per gallon. Japan, which bore the brunt of the oil shocks, made spectacular improvements and now has the highest energy efficiency in the world. From 1965 to 2008, the use of fossil fuels has continued to grow and their share of the energy supply has increased. From 2003 to 2008, coal was the fastest growing fossil fuel.|$|E

500|$|According to Saunders, <b>{{increase}}d</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> {{tends to}} increase energy consumption by two means. First, <b>increased</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> makes {{the use of}} energy relatively cheaper, thus encouraging increased use (the direct rebound effect). Second, <b>increased</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> leads to increased economic growth, which pulls up energy use for the whole economy. At the microeconomic level (looking at an individual market), even with the rebound effect, improvements in energy efficiency usually result in reduced energy consumption. That is, the rebound effect is usually less than 100%. However, at the macroeconomic level, more efficient (and hence comparatively cheaper) energy leads to faster economic growth, which increases energy use throughout the economy. Saunders argued that, taking into account both microeconomic and [...] macroeconomic effects, technological progress that improves energy efficiency will tend to increase overall energy use.|$|E

50|$|<b>Increased</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> can {{increase}} energy consumption by three means. Firstly, <b>increased</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> makes {{the use of}} energy relatively cheaper, thus encouraging increased use. Secondly, <b>increased</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> leads to increased economic growth, which pulls up energy use in the whole economy. Thirdly, increased efficiency in any one bottleneck resource multiplies the use of all the companion technologies, products and services that were being restrained by it. One simple example is that suburban development limited by water use can be doubled if the houses adopt water efficiency measures that cut their water demand in half. That way a small efficiency can have large opposite multiplier effect. Similarly cars that use less fuel are likely to cause matching increases {{in the number of}} cars and trips and companion travel activities rather than a decrease in energy demand. It appears that these latent multipliers of opposite effects may be generally greater than the linear result of the original effect. As of late 2008 this appears to not have been factored into the general discussion of sustainability and global warming mitigation strategies.|$|E
