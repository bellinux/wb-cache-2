40|$|Development of teratocarcinoma {{does not}} impair {{immunization}} of mice against Listeria monocytogenes. Endotoxin injection {{a short time}} before tumor cell inoculation allows the growth of teratocarcinoma in non syngenic mice despite immune stimulation. In contrast with this absence of impaired systematic immunity, teratocarcinoma cells were found to repulse macrophages in vitro. This effect on macrophages was also found with three other malignant cells and with trophoblast cells. In vivo, teratocarcinoma cells were found to impair local inflammation. These cells and other malignant cells are able to produce a compound(s) of molecular weight between 103 and 104, which prevents inflammatory reaction. These results suggest that mouse teratocarcinomas and other tumors by-pass the host <b>immunological</b> system of <b>surveillance</b> by at least two mechanisms: a direct toxic effect on macrophages {{and the release of}} an inhibitor of inflammation.

40|$|Cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) {{interactions}} play fundamental {{roles in}} many biological processes. Cells adhere to the ECM and to each other via specific cell surface receptors such as the selectins, integrins, cadherins, members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, and of the CD 44 superfamily [1]. Surface molecules are necessary for cellular cross-talking and thus {{have a major impact}} on gene regulation, immune <b>surveillance,</b> <b>immunological</b> memory, motility, differentiation and growth control. Defined alterations in the cellular communication are features of embryonic development, immunobiology and neoplastic transformation. The model molecule and its functional analysis described here is the glycoprotein CD 44 and its many isoforms [2]. CD 44 has been implicated to act in processes such as lymphocyte homing, haematopoiesis, tumour dissemination, lymphocyte activation, pattern formation in embryogenesis and inflammatory reactions [2, 3, 4, 5]. This multipurpose nature of CD 44 can possibly be explained by the enormous number of isoforms. Although only encoded by one gene, CD 44 represents a large family of molecules which differ in the primary structure. These differences are brought about by alternative splicing of at least ten unique exons, encoding extracellular regions. The function of the variant isoforms has been a matter of speculation for a long time, but now analysing mice which carry targeted mutations of specific exons a clearer picture is emerging...|$|R

40|$|Ovarian cancer spreads intraperitoneally {{and forms}} fluid, whereby the {{diagnosis}} and therapy often become delayed. As the complement (C) system may provide a cytotoxic effector arm for both <b>immunological</b> <b>surveillance</b> and mAb-therapy, we have characterised the C system in the intraperitoneal ascitic fluid (AF) from ovarian cancer patients. Most of the AF samples showed alternative and classical pathway haemolytic activity. The levels of C 3 and C 4 were similar to or in the lower normal range when compared to values in normal sera, respectively. However, elevated levels of C 3 a and soluble C 5 b- 9 suggested C activation in vivo. Malignant cells isolated from the AF samples had surface deposits of C 1 q and C 3 activation products, but not of C 5 b- 9 (the membrane attack complex; MAC). Activation could have become initiated by anti-tumour cell antibodies that were detected in the AFs and/or by changes on tumour cell surfaces. The lack of MAC was {{probably due to the}} expression of C membrane regulators CD 46, CD 55 and CD 59 on the tumour cells. Soluble forms of C 1 inhibitor, CD 59 and CD 46, and the alternative pathway inhibitors factor H and FHL- 1 were present in the AF at concentrations higher than in serum samples.

40|$|With {{the recent}} {{advances}} in the <b>immunological</b> <b>surveillance</b> system, {{an understanding of the}} role of host immunity has become essential to the management of carcinogenesis, tumor proliferation, recurrence and metastasis. Although it is important to continue chemical and surgical treatment of cancer, support of the anti-tumor immune system of the host should also be considered. Long term remission has been reported in leukemia by treating with BCG after chemotherapy whereas surgical treatment is usually more effective in preventing cancer recurrence in digestive organ cancer. The first step is extirpating the tumor as thoroughly as possible and the second step is chemo-immunotherapy. Cancer immunity, however weak, constitutes the basis for other treatments in selectively attacking cancer cells remaining after surgery, chemotherapy or irradiation.

40|$|Phagocytosis {{activity}} of hemocytes {{of the host}} Gallerin mellonella (Lepidoptera) was modulated by the infection of the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema feltiae (Rahbditida) and {{was found to be}} correlated with the opsonization of bacteria by hemolymph factors. The presence of nematodes resulted in a significative decrease in phagocytosis of bacteria by host hemocytes, both in in vivo and in in vitro assays. Host interacting proteins (HIPs), which appear to function as opsonic factors and are essential to perform immune responses, were removed by S. feltiae from host hemolymph, by means of its epicuticle binding properties. Host humoral factors sequestered by the parasite have been identified by monodimensional and 2 D electrophoretic analysis.

30|$|The immune system, {{which plays}} an {{important}} role in immune responses and immunologic function, consists of immune organs (including bone marrow, thymus and lymph nodes), immune cells (including lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils) and secreted factors such as serum complement proteins, immunoglobulins, interferons and tumour necrosis factor. The immune system is subdivided into several groups. The first division is between innate (non-specific) and adaptive (specific) immunity, and adaptive immunity can be further divided into humoral and cell-mediated immunity depending on the target antigen. The immune system is critical for resisting pathogen invasion and has three vital functions: (1) immune defence, or combatting the invasion of pathogenic microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria and other contaminants; (2) <b>immunological</b> <b>surveillance,</b> or recognizing, killing and eliminating mutated cells to prevent cancers; and (3) immunological homeostasis, or removing aged and dying cells to maintain bodily homeostasis.

40|$|Human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) {{infection is}} largely asymptomatic in the immunocompetent host, but remains {{a major cause}} of morbidity in immunosuppressed individuals. Using the recently described technique of staining antigen-specific CD 8 (+) T cells with peptide-HLA tetrameric complexes, we have demonstrated high levels of antigen-specific cells specific for HCMV peptides and show that this may exceed 4 % of CD 8 (+) T cells in immunocompetent donors. Moreover, by staining with tetramers in combination with antibodies to cell surface markers and intracellular cytokines, we demonstrate functional heterogeneity of HCMV-specific populations. A substantial proportion of these are effector cytotoxic T lymphocytes, as demonstrated by their ability to lyse peptide-pulsed targets in "fresh" killing assays.

40|$|Background Notoriously the {{treatment}} of multiple sclerosis (MS) {{is based on the}} use of several different drugs, characterized by a diverse mechanism of action, efficacy and safety. Recently, progress has been made towards developing new oral immunotherapies, and dimethyl fumarate is the third oral agent approved for {{the treatment}} of relapsing-remitting forms. Case A 24 -year-old patient, affected by relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, started treatment in December 2014 with dimethyl fumarate. The common side effects (flushing and gastrointestinal events) of dimethyl fumarate occurred at the beginning of treatment, but resolved after 1 month. Six months later, the patient presented with serious recrudescence of the gastrointestinal event. In addition to this symptom, he had developed acute omphalitis-a very rare infection in adults. Conclusion The pathogenic role of dimethyl fumarate to induce this rare infection was probably related to changes in <b>immunological</b> <b>surveillance</b> {{as well as to the}} irritant effect of this agent on the gastrointestinal epithelium. Therefore, post-marketing studies in clinical practice are still needed to provide the necessary long-term safety data...|$|E

The histological organisation {{and distribution of}} lymphoid cell subpopulations of these tissues {{were similar to those}} described in eutherian mammals, although some differences were found in comparison with previous descriptions of American opossum tissues. The main variation among the 3 species was in the structural organisations of the oropharyngeal tonsil and the caecocolic lymphoid patch which were more complex in the koala than in possums. In the koala the extensive crypts of the oropharyngeal tonsils and folding of the mucosa of the caecocolic lymphoid patch increased their surface area and, in addition, both structures had areas of epithelium heavily infiltrated with T and B cells.

40|$|Summary. -In an {{experiment}} involving 950 mice {{with a normal}} lifespan of 2 - 3 years, in laboratory conditions, regular benzpyrene application to the skin was started at 10, 25, 40 or 55 weeks of age. The incidence rate of malignant epithelial tumours among the survivors in each group increased steeply with time. This increase was associated directly with duration of exposure but, given duration, was independent of age {{at the start of}} exposure, as were the growth rates of already established tumours. In our experiment, although age per se was irrelevant, the cancer incidence rate increased approximately as a power of the duration of exposure to benzpyrene. This shows that the observed approximate power-law increase of most human adult cancer incidence rates with age could exist merely because age equals duration of exposure to background and spontaneous carcinogenic stimuli.
