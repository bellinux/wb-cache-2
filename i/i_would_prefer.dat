Jinnah stated, [...] "If I live to see the ideal of a Muslim state being achieved in India, and I was then offered to make a choice between the works of Iqbal and the rulership of the Muslim state, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> the former." ...|$|E

They had previously been made legal guardians of the two girls; Dykins' parentage had been disregarded as he had never legally married Julia. After Lennon's death and Harriet died, Lennon's wife, Yoko Ono, wanted to sell the house— as {{it was still in}} Lennon's name— but she later gave it to the Salvation Army on 2November 1993, even though Lennon had once written a letter, stating: [...] "I always thought of the house he's in [...] as my contribution towards looking after Julia [...] and Jackie. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> the girls to use it." ...|$|E

500|$|Following Red 2, Zeta-Jones {{took another}} sabbatical from acting, saying: [...] "If I'm {{going to leave}} my family {{for any length of}} time it had better be for a role that I haven't played before, [...] <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> to stay at home". She found the role {{opposite}} Bill Nighy and Toby Jones in the British war comedy film Dad's Army (2016), based on the television sitcom of the same name. She was cast as a glamorous journalist reporting on a British Home Guard platoon based in Walmington-on-Sea. Catherine Bray of Variety found the film to be an [...] "amiable but creaky resurrection" [...] of the popular sitcom, and thought that while Zeta-Jones [...] "hits the required single note with some spirit" [...] she was [...] "generally underused" [...] in it. Zeta-Jones returned to television the following year by portraying the actress Olivia de Havilland in the first season of Ryan Murphy's anthology drama series Feud, subtitled Bette and Joan, about the rivalry between the actresses Joan Crawford and Bette Davis (played by Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon, respectively). Dominic Patten of Deadline.com found Zeta-Jones to be [...] "wonderfully cast" [...] and Sonia Saraiya of Variety praised her for providing [...] "the best turn in the show". Displeased with an [...] "unauthorized use of her name and identity" [...] in the series, de Havilland, at 101 years old, sued the network and producers of Feud for invasion of privacy and other personality rights.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, during CNN {{coverage}} of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, he confronted Sen. Mary Landrieu, Sen. Trent Lott, and the Reverend Jesse Jackson about {{their perception of the}} government response. As Cooper said later in an interview with New York magazine, “Yeah, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> not to be emotional and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> not to get upset, but it's hard not to when you’re surrounded by brave people who are suffering and in need.” As Broadcasting & Cable magazine noted, [...] "In its aftermath, Hurricane Katrina served to usher in a new breed of emo-journalism, skyrocketing CNN's Anderson Cooper to superstardom as CNN's golden boy and a darling of the media circles because of his impassioned {{coverage of}} the storm." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{misconception}} {{could also}} have arisen from a comment made by Winston Churchill, who (regarding Truman's redesign of the seal) joked: [...] "Mr. President, with the greatest respect, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> the American eagle's neck {{to be on a}} swivel so that it could face the olive branches or the arrows, as the occasion might demand".|$|E

2500|$|A [...] "state secret" [...] {{refers to}} any {{information}} that, if disclosed publicly, would be reasonably {{likely to cause}} significant harm to the national defense or foreign relations of the United States.

2500|$|Aderca was {{similarly}} troubled by philosemitism. He believed that positive discrimination was counterproductive, and favored race blindness: [...] "When [...] secretly confesses philosemitism, {{all of a}} sudden I have a hunch. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> to know he is indifferent." [...] Looking back on Romanian antisemitism, Aderca sided with other Jewish thinkers who looked favorably on ethno-nationalists such as Mihai Eminescu. He argued that Eminescu's work was not particularly antisemitic, and evidenced those traits which gave it universal appeal.|$|E

2500|$|In 1997, Gove {{wrote in}} support of {{bringing}} back hanging as capital punishment, which was abolished in the UK in 1965, although he has not repeated such views since.

2500|$|On {{the issue}} of Scottish independence, {{when asked if he}} would {{consider}} himself a unionist, Corbyn said: [...] "No, I would describe myself as a Socialist. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> the UK to stay together, yes, but I recognise the right of people to take the decision on their own autonomy and independence." [...] Corbyn said that he did not favour holding a second Scottish independence referendum, but that it would be wrong for the UK Parliament to block such a referendum if the Scottish Parliament desired to have one.|$|E

He also criticised the decision by Scottish Labour to work with Conservatives in the Better Together campaign, {{and said that he}} had not actively participated in the referendum campaign. Corbyn also stated his belief that economic inequality exists across the UK, and that Labour should unite people {{on the basis of a}} [...] "radical economic strategy".|$|E
2500|$|Assange {{wrote on}} WikiLeaks in February 2016: [...] "I have had years of {{experience}} in dealing with Hillary Clinton and have read thousands of her cables. Hillary lacks judgement and will push the United States into endless, stupid wars which spread terrorism. ...she certainly should not become president of the United States." [...] On 25 July, following the Republican National Convention (RNC), during an interview by Amy Goodman, Assange said that choosing between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is like choosing between cholera or gonorrhea. [...] "Personally, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> neither."

2500|$|Khan has a {{reputation}} for avoiding award ceremonies and not accepting any popular Indian film awards. Though nominated many times, Khan has not attended any Indian film award ceremonies and has stated that [...] "Indian film awards lack credibility". When asked about the selection procedure and authenticity of popular Indian film awards, Aamir Khan said, [...] "Fact is that I have no objections to film awards per se. I just feel that if I don't value a particular film award, then I won't attend it either. Apart from the National Film Awards, I don't see any other award ceremony that I should give value to. My personal experience about these award ceremonies is that I don't trust them. I have no faith in them so <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> to stay away." ...|$|E

[...] Collinet continued, translating from his interview in French with Bopol for the program, [...] "Bopol says, if there were good studios in Zaire <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> to work there, because there I have lots of inspiration -- you can see what people are doing.

2500|$|While in Europe, Zhou, {{also named}} as John Knight, studied the differing {{approaches}} to resolving class conflict adopted by various European nations. In London in January 1921, Zhou witnessed a large miners' strike {{and wrote a}} series of articles for the Yishi bao (generally sympathetic to the miners) examining the conflict between workers and employers, and the conflict's resolution. [...] After five weeks in London he moved to Paris, where interest in Russia's 1917 October Revolution was high. In a letter to his cousin, Zhou identified two broad paths of reform for China: [...] "gradual reform" [...] (as in England) or [...] "violent means" [...] (as in Russia). Zhou wrote that [...] "I do not have a preference for either the Russian or the British way... <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> something in-between, rather than one of these two extremes".|$|E

Fool for a Lifetime album in its {{entirety}} in Santiago in November 2011. Mike Patton recently sung on the Secret Chiefs 3 song [...] "La Chanson de Jacky" [...] in 2012 giving further speculation by fans on the chance of a reunion. Despite this, Trevor Dunn stated in a February 2013 interview with SF Weekly that there will be no Mr. Bungle reunion, saying, [...] "I've heard the faintest murmurings about it, but honestly I don't think anyone is interested. It's nothing personal, either. We all feel like that band said what it needed to say. It would feel weird and awkward to play that music again. It would take a pant-load of money to make it happen, and honestly, I don't want to do it for that reason. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> to let go of it, respectfully." [...] When asked about Mr. Bungle reuniting in an interview published in February 2014, Patton responded by saying, [...] "Who knows?
