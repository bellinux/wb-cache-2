The feed conversion rate of orthopterans is 1.7kg/kg, while for beef it is typically about 10kg/kg. The protein content in fresh weight is between 13–28 g/100g for adult locust, 14–18 g/100g for larvae, as compared to 19–26 g/100g for beef. The calculated protein <b>efficiency</b> <b>ratio</b> is however low, with 1.69 for locust protein compared to 2.5 for standard casein.

A ton of air-conditioning {{is defined as the}} removal of 12,000 BTU/hour (3500 W). The equivalent ton on the cooling tower side actually rejects about 15,000 BTU/hour (4400 W) due to the additional waste heat-equivalent of the energy needed to drive the chiller's compressor. This equivalent ton is defined as the heat rejection in cooling 3 US gallons/minute (1,500 pound/hour) of water 10°F (6°C), which amounts to 15,000 BTU/hour, assuming a chiller coefficient of performance (COP) of 4.0.

MÉTODOS: Após o desmame, 56 ratos Wistar, submetidos à desnutrição pós-natal, foram aleatoriamente distribuídos em 7 grupos diferenciados segundo o tipo de dieta oferecida: controle, dietas deficientes em vitaminas, deficientes em minerais, deficientes em vitaminas e minerais e os grupos cujas dietas deficientes eram suplementadas com a "multimistura" (dietas deficientes em vitaminas + "multimistura", deficientes em minerais + "multimistura" e deficientes em vitaminas e minerais + "multimistura").

O ganho ponderal e os Coeficientes de Eficiência Protéica ou alimentar foram usados como indicadores da efetividade da "multimistura" como suplemento de vitaminas e/ou minerais.

METHODS: After weaning, 56 Wistar rats which had been submitted to under-nutrition since birth, were divided randomly into 7 groups, according to the diet supplied, namely: control, vitamin deficient, mineral deficient, vitamin and mineral deficient, vitamin deficient supplemented with "multi-mixture", mineral deficient supplemented with "multi-mixture", and vitamin and mineral deficient supplemented with "multi-mixture". The recorded weight gains during the treatment period, together with the protein <b>efficiency</b> <b>ratios</b> and the food <b>efficiency</b> <b>ratios,</b> were taken as indicators of the efficiency of "multi-mixture" as a vitamin and/or mineral supplement. RESULTS: After 28 days, gains in body weight and the values of protein <b>efficiency</b> <b>ratios</b> and food <b>efficiency</b> <b>ratios</b> were significantly lower (p< 0. 05) than those of the control group for all treatment groups except for that fed on vitamin deficient supplemented with "multi-mixture".

Very few industry experts have the skills or experience to fully capture benefits of the passive design. Such passive solar designs are much more cost-effective than adding expensive photovoltaic panels on the roof of a conventional inefficient building.

Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a widely used mathematical programming approach for comparing the inputs and outputs {{of a set of}} homogeneous decision making units (DMUs) by evaluating their relative efficiency.

DESIGN: WHO mortality rates for baseline 3 years 1989 - 1991 and 2008 - 2010 were analysed, and confidence intervals determine any significant differences between the UK and other countries in reducing the mortalities. <b>Efficiency</b> <b>ratios</b> are calculated by dividing reduced mortality over the period by the average % of national income. SETTING: Twenty-one similar socio-economic Western countries. PARTICIPANTS: The 21 countries' general population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cancer mortality rates, total mortality rates Gross Domestic Product and <b>Efficiency</b> <b>Ratios.</b> RESULTS: Economic Input: In 1980, UK national income was 5. 6 % and the European average was 7. 1 %. By 2010, UK national income was 9. 4 % being equal 17 th of 21 averaging 7. 1 % over the period. Europe's 1980 - 2010 average of 8. 4 % yields a UK to Europe ratio of 1 : 1. 18. Clinical output 1989 - 2010 : UK Cancer Mortality Rates was the sixth highest, but equal sixth biggest fall, significantly greater than 14 other countries.
