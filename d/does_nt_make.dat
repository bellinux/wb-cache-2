40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of growth cone (GC) and neurite retraction {{resulting from a}} rapid incrase in concentration of the trophic molecule NGF was studied. Neurite outgrowth from explants of 8 -d chick embryo dorsal root ganglia was achieved at very low NGF concentrations with heart conditioned medium during overnight culture. Quickly incrasing the NGF concentration in the growth medium dramatically affected GC and neurite morphology: the majority of GCs and neurites collapsed and retracted towards the cell body over a course of approximately 2 - 5 min. Retraction was elicited by increasing NGF levels from 0 to 0. 05 ng/ml to as little as 0. 5 ng/ml but did not occur if the NGF concentration during the initial overnight culture period exceeded 0. 8 ng/ml, regardless of how much the concentration was elevated. Similar concentration changes of cytochrome c or insulin <b>did</b> <b>nt</b> result in retraction. Neurites that had been separated from their cell bodies by cutting close to their exit from the explant still retracted when NGF levels were raised. Cytochalasin B reversible inhibits retraction, whereas colchicine allows retraction to occur.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that photon shot noise and radiation-pressure back-action noise are the sole forms of quantum noise in {{interferometric}} gravitational wave detectors that operate near {{or below the}} standard quantum limit, if one filters the interferometer output appropriately. No additional noise arises from the test masses' initial quantum state or from reduction of the test-mass state due to measurement of the interferometer output or from the uncertainty principle associated with the test-mass state. Two features of interferometers are central to these conclusions: (i) The interferometer output (the photon number flux N(t) entering the final photodetector) commutes with itself at different times in the Heisenberg Picture, [N(t), N(t') ] = 0, and thus {{can be regarded as}} classical. (ii) This number flux is linear in the test-mass initial position and momentum operators x_o and p_o, and those operators influence the measured photon flux N(t) in manners that can easily be removed by filtering [...] e. g., in most interferometers, by discarding data near the test masses' 1 Hz swinging freqency. The test-mass operators x_o and p_o contained in the unfiltered output <b>N(t)</b> <b>make</b> a nonzero contribution to the commutator [N(t), N(t') ]. That contribution is cancelled by a nonzero commutation of the photon shot noise and radiation-pressure noise, which also are contained in N(t). This cancellation of commutators is responsible for {{the fact that it is}} possible to derive an interferometer's standard quantum limit from test-mass considerations, and independently from photon-noise considerations. These conclusions are true for a far wider class of measurements than just gravitational-wave interferometers. To elucidate them, this paper presents a series of idealized thought experiments that are free from the complexities of real measuring systems.

Stimulation of lipolytic activity in adipose tissue or inhibition of fat synthesis is one way to prevent these serious diseases. Lactic acid bacteria have an anti-obesity effect, but the mechanisms are unclear. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of the administration of lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus gasseri NT) on lipid metabolism and fat synthesis in a mouse high-fat-diet model, focusing on visceral fat. Balb/c mice were fed a 45 kcal % fat diet for 13 weeks with and without a freeze-dried preparation of L. gasseri NT (109 CFU/g). An ex vivo glycerol assay with periovarian fat revealed that L. gasseri <b>NT</b> <b>did</b> not stimulate lipolytic activity.

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at: [URL] {{of the benefits}} from conservation tillage are attained by maintaining crop residues on the soil surface. However, the effectiveness of crop residues depends on their persistence in time and maintenance of sufficient residue cover can become difficult, especially when a long-fallow period is involved. In this study, we evaluate the effects of conventional tillage (CT) and two conservation tillage systems (reduced tillage, RT, and no-tillage, NT), under both continuous cropping (CC) and cereal-fallow rotation (CF), on the dynamics of surface barley residues during four fallow periods in a dryland field of semiarid Aragon. The CC system involves a summer fallow period of 5 - 6 months and the CF rotation a long-fallow of 17 - 18 months. Results indicate {{that the lack of}} residue-disturbing operations in <b>NT</b> <b>makes</b> this practice the best strategy for fallow management. With this tillage system, the soil surface still conserved a residue cover of 10 - 15 % after long-fallowing and percentages of standing residues ranging from 20 % to 40 % of the total mass after the first 11 - 12 months. In both CT and RT, primary tillage operations had the major influence on residue incorporation, with percentages of cover reduction of 90 - 100 % after mouldboard ploughing (CT) and 50 - 70 % after chiselling (RT). Two decomposition models were tested, the Douglas-Rickman and the Steiner models. Our data indicate that the Steiner model described more accurately the decline of surface residue mass over the long-fallow period in the NT plots. Measured and predicted data indicate that, under NT, 80 - 90 % of the initial residue mass is lost at the end of fallow and that 60 - 75 % of this loss occurs during the first 9 - 10 months. Finally, the mass-to-cover relationship established in this study for barley residues could be used to predict soil cover from flat residue mass through the fallow period by using a single Am coefficient (0. 00208 ha kg- 1).
