A PIV set-up was chosen that the light sheet defines a vertical plane (XZ) between {{the ground and the}} train in the symmetry line of the train.

There lacks research on grinding path planning with the constraint of curvature.

The grinding process must satisfy the universal demands of the <b>belt</b> <b>grinding</b> technologies, and {{the most important thing is}} to make the contact wheel conform to the local geometrical features on the contact area. For the local surfaces with small curvature, the curve length between the neighboring cutting locations becomes longer to ensure processing efficiency. Otherwise, for the local areas with large curvature, the curve length becomes shorter to ensure machining accuracy. A series of planes are created to intersect with the target surface to be ground, and the corresponding sectional profile curves are obtained. For each curve, the curve length between the neighboring cutting points is optimized by inserting a cutter location at the local area with large curvatures. A method of generating the grinding paths including curve length spacing optimization is set up. The validity is completely approved by the off-line simulation, and during the grinding experiments with the method, the quality of surface is improved. The path planning method provides a theoretical support for the smooth and accuracy path of robotic surface grinding...|$|R
