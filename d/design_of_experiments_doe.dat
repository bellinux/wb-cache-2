50|$|The {{science of}} <b>Design</b> <b>of</b> <b>Experiments</b> (<b>DOE)</b> {{has been around}} for over a century, pioneered by R.A. Fisher for {{agricultural}} studies. Many of the classic experiment designs can be used in simulation studies. However, computational experiments have far fewer restrictions than do real-world experiments, in terms of costs, number of factors, time required, ability to replicate, ability to automate, etc. Consequently, a framework specifically oriented toward large-scale simulation experiments is warranted.|$|E
50|$|The <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>experiments</b> (<b>DOE,</b> DOX, or {{experimental}} design) is {{the design}} of any task that aims to describe or explain the variation of information under conditions that are hypothesized to reflect the variation. The term is generally associated with true experiments in which the design introduces conditions that directly affect the variation, but may also refer to {{the design of}} quasi-experiments, in which natural conditions that influence the variation are selected for observation.|$|E
30|$|The defect size is {{measured}} by considering the change in intensity over the defect indication compared to the background together with an intensity calibration, a procedure considered conventional in radiography.

40|$|Abstract—Machining {{parameters}} {{are very important}} in determining the surface quality of any material. In the past decade, some new engineering materials were developed for the manufacturing industry which created a need to conduct an investigation {{on the impact of}} the said parameters on their surface roughness. Polyurethane (PU) block is widely used in the automotive industry to manufacture parts such as checking fixtures that are used to verify the dimensional accuracy of automotive parts. In this paper, the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>experiment</b> (<b>DOE)</b> was used to investigate on the effect of the milling parameters on the PU block. Furthermore, an analysis of the machined surface chemical composition was done using scanning electron microscope (SEM). It was found that the surface roughness of the PU block is severely affected when PU undergoes a flood machining process instead of a dry condition. In addition the stepover and the silicon content were found to be the most significant parameters that influence the surface quality of the PU block.

5000|$|<b>Design</b> <b>of</b> <b>Experiments</b> (<b>DOE)</b> is a {{methodology}} for formulating scientific and engineering problems using statistical models. The protocol specifies a randomization procedure for the experiment and specifies the primary data-analysis, particularly in hypothesis testing. In a secondary analysis, the statistical analyst further examines {{the data to}} suggest other questions and to help plan future experiments. In engineering applications, the goal is often to optimize a process or product, rather than to subject a scientific hypothesis to test of its predictive adequacy. The use of optimal (or near optimal) designs reduces the cost of experimentation.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Design</b> <b>of</b> <b>experiments</b> (<b>DOE)</b> is a {{fundamental}} part of experimentation, modeling, and simulation. Banks [...] states, [...] "Experimental design is concerned with reducing {{the time and effort}} associated with simulating by identifying the information needed to be gathered from each simulation replication, how many replications need to be made, and what model parameter changes need to be compared." [...] After a conceptual model has been implemented as a programmed model, DOE is necessary to perform experimentation and obtain simulation results in the most timely and cost-efficient manner. The following examples demonstrate situations where RPDs can be used to draw significant conclusions.|$|E
30|$|The basic {{rule for}} the {{generation}} of the initial population is that it should sample as much genetic material as possible. Considering this point, the problem of generating a good initial population resembles that of creating an optimal <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>experiment</b> (<b>DOE)</b> uniformly filling the sampling space. For this reason, {{it is well known}} (Sloan and Woźniakowski 1998) that low-discrepancy (or quasi-random) sequences as Sobol’s (1967) are to be preferred over pseudo-random generators.|$|R
30|$|To {{determine}} {{the most influential}} variables, a proper screening <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>experiment</b> (<b>DOE)</b> is performed on the selected uncertain parameters. DOE proposes the sufficient number <b>of</b> <b>experiments</b> and determines the levels of all factors during each experiment. The term “experiment” {{in the application of}} well-testing interpretation refers to a well-testing design generated by the analytical or numerical models. Each experiment involves a pressure derivative curve plotted for the corresponding well-testing design that would be used for further analysis.|$|R
30|$|Today’s {{competitive}} environment impels companies {{to improve the}} quality of their products proactively, so the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>experiments</b> (<b>DOEs)</b> can be one of the most efficient methods for this purpose. The experimental design helps us find the effects of the controllable and nuisance factors on one or more responses. Finding the combination of controllable factor levels, namely treatment, which leads to the most appropriate process outputs is one of the common challenges in quality engineering researches.|$|R
50|$|DFSS {{seeks to}} avoid manufacturing/service process {{problems}} by using advanced techniques to avoid process {{problems at the}} outset (e.g., fire prevention). When combined, these methods obtain the proper needs of the customer, and derive engineering system parameter requirements that increase product and service effectiveness {{in the eyes of}} the customer and all other people. This yields products and services that provide great customer satisfaction and increased market share. These techniques also include tools and processes to predict, model and simulate the product delivery system (the processes/tools, personnel and organization, training, facilities, and logistics to produce the product/service). In this way, DFSS is closely related to operations research (solving the knapsack problem), workflow balancing. DFSS is largely a design activity requiring tools including: quality function deployment (QFD), axiomatic design, TRIZ, Design for X, <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>experiments</b> (<b>DOE),</b> Taguchi methods, tolerance design, robustification and Response Surface Methodology for a single or multiple response optimization. While these tools are sometimes used in the classic DMAIC Six Sigma process, they are uniquely used by DFSS to analyze new and unprecedented products and processes. It is a concurrent analyzes directed to manufacturing optimization related to the design.|$|E
