5|$|The curve-billed thrasher can {{generally}} be found running rapidly from {{cover to cover}} or flying near ground level <b>from</b> <b>bush</b> to bush. However, this bird is not shy about being in the open. It is generally a forager on ground level but can be very aggressive in routing out potential competitors for food at feeders, such as the Inca dove and round-tailed ground squirrel. It will usually destroy any nest of cactus wrens.|$|E

5|$|Telopea oreades is {{not listed}} under Commonwealth {{environmental}} legislation {{and is not}} considered by respective state authorities to be rare or threatened in Victoria or New South Wales. The species does occur in the threatened Cool Temperate Rainforest Community in Victoria that is protected under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act, {{and it is a}} component of the threatened Southern Escarpment Wet Sclerophyll Forests of far southern New South Wales. Furthermore, planted specimens are frequently stolen <b>from</b> <b>bush</b> regeneration sites as they are desirable garden plants. Conversely in New Zealand, there is a report of T. oreades escaping into kanuka scrub from the trout hatchery gardens on the Tongariro River south of Lake Taupo.|$|E

In June 2002, the U.S. agreed to forgive $14million of Peru's debt in exchange for a promise to invest $12million in conservation projects. In September, Toledo secured a $300million commitment <b>from</b> <b>Bush</b> to fund alternative-crop development in coca-producing areas. In 2003, the Peace Corps returned to Peru.|$|E
25|$|At its launch, the Service {{was located}} {{along with most}} radio output in Broadcasting House. However, {{following}} the explosion of a parachute mine nearby on 8 December 1940, it relocated to premises away from the likely target of Broadcasting House. The Overseas service relocated to Oxford Street while the European service moved temporarily to the emergency broadcasting facilities at Maida Vale Studios. The European services moved permanently into Bush House {{towards the end of}} 1940, completing the move in 1941, with the Overseas services joining them in 1958. Bush House subsequently became the home of the BBC World Service and the building itself has gained a global reputation with the audience of the service. However, the building was vacated in 2012 {{as a result of the}} Broadcasting House changes and the end of the building's lease that year; the first service to move was the Burmese Service on 11 March 2012 and the final broadcast <b>from</b> <b>Bush</b> House was a news bulletin broadcast at 11.00GMT on 12 July 2012.|$|E

500|$|According to MDD Newitt, Clark {{embodied}} much of {{the pioneering}} spirit {{of the time and}} was [...] "an object of legend" [...] to his fellow frontiersmen. [...] "He had led a wild, tough life but it had not turned him either into a rascal or into an uncouth bush dweller," [...] Brelsford writes. [...] "Changa-Changa" [...] endured in the local vernacular as a word roughly meaning [...] "boss", and was still in use in Zambia in the 1970s. Summarising Clark's life, Peter Duignan and Lewis Gann conclude that he [...] "experienced in his own person the transition <b>from</b> <b>bush</b> feudalism to capitalism." ...|$|E

On July 1, 1918 his convoy spotted two enemy submarines and attacked them with depth charges. It is not known whether the submarines were damaged. During the Henderson's seventh troop transport voyage to France {{there was a fire}} on board on July 2, 1918, that resulted in the ship returning to the United States.

Billboard stated that the lyrics [...] "Are you sure you wanna love me? / I know that it's a lot to handle me / But {{it is what it is}} / It's all part of my broken history" [...] were [...] "ultra personal".

500|$|The NCAA {{found that}} Bush had {{received}} gifts from two sports agents {{from at least}} December 2004, including a limousine ride to the 2005 Heisman Trophy presentation and a rent-free home.

[...] It was also banned from bowl games in 2010 and 2011 and lost 30 scholarships over three years. [...] Running backs coach Todd McNair was banned from off-campus recruiting for one year after the NCAA determined he'd known about Bush's dealings with the agents. [...] The NCAA also forced USC to permanently disassociate itself <b>from</b> <b>Bush.</b> These sanctions have been criticized by some NCAA football writers, including ESPN’s Ted Miller, who wrote, “It's become an accepted fact among informed college football observers that the NCAA sanctions against USC were a travesty of justice, and the NCAA’s refusal to revisit that travesty are a massive act of cowardice {{on the part of the}} organization.

5000|$|Hornung's later {{stories in}} the A. J.

When he published the novel Peccavi in 1900, a critic from The Advertiser wrote a scathing review, writing that Hornung {{should go back to}} Australia so he would be inspired to write something as good as A Bride <b>from</b> the <b>Bush</b> again. Upon Hornung's death, a tribute in The Freeman's Journal called A Bride <b>from</b> the <b>Bush</b> [...] "the best and the best known" [...] of Hornung's Australia-related stories. In 1924 André Cœuroy and Theodore Baker argued in The Musical Quarterly that Hornung's characterisation of the novel's hero as being pitiable for being unable to appreciate anthems demonstrates that A Bride <b>from</b> the <b>Bush</b> is typical of other novels of the time in favouring vocal church music.|$|R
