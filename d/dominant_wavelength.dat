A unique green (green appearing neither yellowish nor bluish) is produced on such a device by mixing light from the green primary with some light from the blue primary.|$|E
500|$|Green is {{the color}} between blue and yellow on the visible spectrum. It is evoked by light with a has <b>dominant</b> <b>wavelength</b> of roughly 495570 nm. In {{subtractive}} color systems, [...] used in painting and color printing, it is created {{by a combination of}} yellow and blue, or yellow and cyan; in the RGB color model, used on television and computer screens, {{it is one of the}} additive primary colors, along with red and blue, which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors. [...] By far the largest contributor to green in nature is chlorophyll, the chemical by which plants photosynthesize and convert sunlight into chemical energy. Many creatures have adapted to their green environments by taking on a green hue themselves as camouflage. Several minerals have a green color, including the emerald, which is colored green by its chromium content.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} purity on hue has been {{reported}} severally (including Munsell and NCS data on constant hue loci) over 100 years but without general agreement. For example, the number of hue shift nulls in the data vary from 2 to 6. Hence, despite this effect’s commonality it lacks reliable data for modeling underlying mechanisms or color appearance. The purity of a stimulus may be decreased by adding white (as in Abney’s experiment), by adding black, or by adding gray such that luminance, or alternatively lightness, remains constant. This article gives new data for CRT stimuli for illuminant D 65 for all four conditions but mainly for equal luminance, for 31 observers and 13 test <b>dominant</b> <b>wavelengths.</b> Further, samples were observed in two temporal conditions: either simultaneously as pairs (the contrast mode) or singly (the no-contrast mode). Three types of samples were tested: (1) equal luminance 30 cd/m 2 for all <b>dominant</b> <b>wavelengths,</b> (2) equal lightness for all <b>dominant</b> <b>wavelengths,</b> and (3) zero-gray colors, requiring different luminances for different <b>dominant</b> <b>wavelengths.</b> In all the above conditions, the resultant hue shifts graphed a robust bimodal curve (two peaks in cyan and red, two troughs in blue and green) across the hue cycle, similar to Munsell and NCS data except the definite peak in cyan. 15 page(s...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: A complex process-based {{model is}} used to {{simulate}} the formation of channels and shoals in a schematised estuary. The model set-up enables a comparison with results obtained with idealised models. Initial as well as long-term simulations are made. <b>Dominant</b> <b>wavelengths</b> of channel-shoal patterns are investigated together with their dependency on width and depth of the basin and the local maximum velocity. Prevalent wavelengths range between 5 and 10 km and increase with increasing width and flow velocity. Initial model results are compared with idealised models. The <b>dominant</b> <b>wavelengths</b> are of the same order of magnitude as {{those found in the}} idealised model of Schramkowski et al. (2002) and their dependency on width and velocity agrees qualitatively. (Exponential) growth of the perturbations during long-term simulations provides information on the validity limits of the idealised models. Subsequent pattern formation and changes of <b>dominant</b> <b>wavelengths</b> are attributed to non-linear interactions. Morphological developments during long-term simulations suggest that channel-shoal patterns evolve into a unique morphodynamic equilibrium state, independent of the initial perturbation. This complex non-linear approach is an innovative step towards an integrated model approach in which different model types and field data are combined in order to make optimal use of each research method...|$|R
2500|$|Blue {{is one of}} {{the three}} primary colours of {{pigments}} in painting and traditional colour theory, {{as well as in the}} RGB colour model. It lies between violet and green on the spectrum of visible light. The eye perceives blue when observing light with a <b>dominant</b> <b>wavelength</b> between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres. [...] Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colors; azure contains some green, while ultramarine contains some violet. The clear sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering. [...] An optical effect called Tyndall scattering explains blue eyes. Distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called atmospheric perspective.|$|E
2500|$|Chromaticity {{diagrams}} are two-dimensional diagrams that plot {{the projection}} of the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) XYZ color space onto the (x, y) plane. The X, Y, Z values (or tristimulus values) are simply used as weightings to create new colors from the primary colors, much {{in the same way}} that RGB is used for creating colors from primaries in televisions or photographs. The x and y values used to create the chromaticity diagram are created from the XYZ values by dividing X and Y by the sum of X, Y, Z. [...] The chromaticity values that can then be plotted are dependent upon two values: <b>dominant</b> <b>wavelength</b> and saturation. Since luminous energy is not included, colors that differ only in its lightness are not distinguished on the diagram. For instance, brown, which is just a low-luminance mixture of orange and red, will not appear as such.|$|E
2500|$|Red is {{the color}} {{at the end of}} visible {{spectrum}} of light, next to orange and opposite violet. It has a <b>dominant</b> <b>wavelength</b> of approximately [...] 625–740 nanometers. [...] It is a primary color in the RGB color model and the CMYK color model, and is the complementary color of cyan. Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red crimson, and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy. [...] The red sky at sunset results from Rayleigh scattering, while the red color of the Grand Canyon and other geological features is caused by hematite or red ochre, both forms of iron oxide. Iron oxide also gives the red color to the planet Mars. The red color of blood comes from protein hemoglobin, while ripe strawberries, red apples and reddish autumn leaves are colored by anthocyanins.|$|E

In {{contrast with the}} well-known high angle wave instability, which involves both the surf and shoaling zones and develops at km-scale wavelengths, the present mechanism involves only the surf zone.

40|$|The {{development}} of a model for deformation in an extending continental lithosphere that is stratified in density and strength is described.
