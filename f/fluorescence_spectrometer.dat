In this article we present a new method for the sensitive detection of exopeptidases based on fluorescently-labeled substrates containing only one fluorophore that is efficiently quenched by an adjacent tryptophan residue via photoinduced electron transfer. Because of their well-known properties we chose carboxypeptidase A (CPA) as a model system.

40|$|A {{group of}} {{variously}} colored proteins {{belonging to the}} green fluorescent protein (GFP) family are responsible for coloring coral tissues. Corals of the Great Barrier Reef were studied with the custom-built fiber laser <b>fluorescence</b> <b>spectrometers.</b> Spectral analysis showed {{that most of the}} examined corals contained multiple fluorescent peaks ranging from 470 to 620 nm.

We isolated a novel photo-convertible fluorescent protein (FP) from one of the tested corals.
