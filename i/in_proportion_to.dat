5|$|Compsognathus were small, bipedal {{animals with}} long hind legs and longer tails, which they used for balance during locomotion. The forelimbs were {{smaller than the}} hindlimbs and {{featured}} three digits equipped with solid claws suited for grasping prey. Their delicate skulls were narrow and long, with tapered snouts.

In contrast, the forelimbs were extremely small and bore only two digits, although Daspletosaurus had the longest forelimbs <b>in</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> body size of any tyrannosaurid.

40|$|Abstract. Taking {{the free}} {{vibration}} system of a {{submerged floating tunnel}} tether as research object, the non-linear free vibration equation was set up. By means of Galerkin method, the partial differential equation {{was transformed into a}} set of ordinary ones. The damping ratios of the first four modes were obtained after complex eigenvalue analysis. Subsequently, effects of inclination, sag, initial tension force and length of tether on its modal damping ratios were analyzed. The results show that inclination and sag of tether merely affect the damping ratio of first in-plane mode; they have no effect on the damping ratios of higher order in-plane modes and out of plane modes; the first in-plane modal damping ratio of tether is <b>in</b> direct <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> its inclination, whereas <b>in</b> inverse <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> its sag; the first modal damping ratio of tether (both in-plane and out of plane) is <b>in</b> direct <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> its length, whereas <b>in</b> inverse <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> its initial tension...|$|R
