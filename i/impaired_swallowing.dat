We investigated whether the use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) controlled by the patient could improve swallowing performances in a population of neuromuscular patients requiring daytime NIV. Ten neuromuscular patients with severe respiratory failure requiring extensive NIV use were studied while swallowing without and with NIV (while ventilated with a modified ventilator allowing the patient to withhold ventilation as desired). Breathing-swallowing interactions were investigated by chin electromyography, cervical piezoelectric sensor, nasal flow recording and inductive plethysmography. Two water-bolus sizes (5 and 10 ml) and a textured yogurt bolus were tested in a random order. NIV use significantly improved swallowing fragmentation (defined {{as the number of}} respiratory interruption of the swallowing of a single bolus) (p = 0. 003) and breathing-swallowing synchronization (with a significant increase of swallows followed by an expiration) (p < 0. 0001). Patient exhibited piecemeal swallowing which was not influenced by NIV use (p = 0. 07). NIV use also significantly reduced dyspnea during swallowing (p = 0. 04) while preserving swallowing comfort, regardless of bolus type.

30|$|Venous malformations {{are common}} {{vascular}} malformations, presenting at any location, including {{the head and}} neck region. They are present at birth, expand slowly during childhood, and often enlarge during trauma, puberty, and pregnancy, due to the hormonal changes occurring during these periods. They are composed of an abnormal collection of veins, which are thin-walled, sponge-like channels of variable size, lacking in smooth muscle. In general, they are a bluish compressible mass and tend to slowly expand with time [7, 8]. For example, a venous infiltration of the tongue results in macroglossia, which presents a risk of swelling or bleeding and may <b>impair</b> <b>swallowing</b> and eating.

40|$|Patients {{with chronic}} obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{may be at}} increased risk of aspiration secondary to <b>impaired</b> <b>swallow</b> function. One possible cause of this impairment is a reduction in laryngopharyngeal sensitivity. The relationship between COPD and laryngopharyngeal sensitivity has not been previously determined. We conducted a study to investigate the effect of COPD on laryngopharyngeal sensitivity by using laryngopharyngeal sensory discrimination testing (LPSDT). Our study population was made up of 20 adults (mean age: 71. 7 yr) with clinically proven COPD and 11 healthy, age-matched controls. All 31 subjects underwent LPSDT with the use of an air-pulse stimulator via a nasendoscope. The threshold of laryngopharyngeal sensation was evaluated by measuring the amount of air pressure required to elicit the laryngeal adductor reflex (LAR). We found that the patients with COPD had a significantly higher LAR threshold than did the controls (p< 0. 001). We conclude that patients with COPD have significantly less mechanosensitivity in the laryngopharynx. This sensory change may place patients with COPD at increased risk for aspiration. 7 page(s...|$|R

We performed a retrospective analysis on the medical records of patients submitted to reconstructive surgery after CPL from July 1991 to November 2011. 75 % of the 94 patients underwent reconstruction with a free flap (group A), while 25 % underwent reconstruction with a pedicled flap (group B); 80 % of patients in group A and none in group B were discharged with a free diet; 14 % of patients in group A and 26 % in group B were unable to resume oral feeding and were discharged with NG-tube or PEG. None of the patients acquired a satisfactory oesophageal voice; 17 % of patients in group A and 7 % in group B underwent voice restoration with tracheo-oesophageal voice-prosthesis. In conclusion, free flaps should be considered the first choice for reconstruction of the hypopharynx after CPL because of the better functional results obtained.

40|$|Background: The {{recently}} postulated disease spreading hypothesis {{has gained}} much attention, especially for Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD). The various nonmotor symptoms (NMS) in neurodegenerative diseases {{would be much}} better explained by this hypothesis than by the degeneration of disease-specific cell populations. Motor neuron disease (MND) is primarily known as a group of diseases with a selective loss of motor function. Recent evidence, however, suggests disease spreading into nonmotor brain regions also in MND. The aim {{of this study was to}} comprehensively detect NMS in patients suffering from MND. Methods: We used a self-rating questionnaire including 30 different items of gastrointestinal, autonomic, neuropsychiatric and sleep complaints (NMSQuest) which is an established tool in PD patients. 90 MND patients were included and compared to 96 controls. Results: In total, MND patients reported significantly higher NMS scores (median: 7 points) in comparison to controls (median: 4 points). Dribbling, impaired taste/smelling, <b>impaired</b> <b>swallowing,</b> weight loss, loss of interest, sad/blues, falling and insomnia were significantly more prevalent in MND patients compared to controls. Interestingly excessive sweating was more reported in the MND group. Correlation analysis revealed an increase of total NMS score with disease progression. Conclusions: NMS in MND patients seemed to increase with disease progression which would fit with the recently postulated disease spreading hypothesis. The total NMS score in the MND group significantly exceeded the score for the control group, but only 8 of the 30 single complaints of the NMSQuest were significantly more often reported by MND patients. Dribbling, <b>impaired</b> <b>swallowing,</b> weight loss and falling could primarily be connected to motor neuron degeneration and declared as motor symptoms in MND...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Laryngotracheal {{separation}} (LTS) is {{an effective}} and reliable definitive treatment for intractable aspiration. A major advantage of this treatment for intractable aspiration is its' potential reversibility. Should the underlying disorder improve, {{a reversal of the}} procedure may be attempted. This has been successfully achieved in the adult population. To our knowledge, no previous cases have been reported of successful reversal of LTS in children. METHODS: A retrospective review from 2003 to 2010 identified four cases of intractable aspiration treated with LTS in our department. Two of these patients displayed objective evidence of sufficient recovery of their underlying aspiration to consider reversal. Patient selection for reversal was dependent upon successful oral intake for 9 months along with videofluoroscopic evidence of normal or minimally <b>impaired</b> <b>swallow.</b> RESULTS: Two children who were successfully treated for intractable aspiration with LTS demonstrated objective evidence of recovery sufficient to attempt reversal. Both children underwent successful surgical reversal of LTS using a cricotracheal resection with end-to-end anastamosis, similar to that used in treatment of subglottic stenosis. Both children can now tolerate oral diet and their speech and language development is in line with their overall developmental level. CONCLUSIONS: Laryngotracheal separation {{is an effective}} and reliable definitive treatment for intractable aspiration facilitating protection of the airway and allowing safe swallowing with unimpeded respiration, but with the major drawback of loss of phonation.
