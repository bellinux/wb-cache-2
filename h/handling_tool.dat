Instead of a hook, they are equipped with a specialized <b>handling</b> <b>tool</b> called a spreader. The spreader can be lowered on top of a container and locks onto the container's four locking points ("corner castings") using a twistlock mechanism. Cranes normally transport a single container at once, but some newer cranes have the capability to pick up two to four 20-foot containers at once.|$|E

2500|$|The adze ( [...] ; {{alternative}} spelling: adz) is {{a cutting}} tool shaped somewhat like an axe {{that dates back to}} the stone age. It can be any tool with a sharp cutting edge. Adzes are used for smoothing or carving wood in hand woodworking, similar to an axe but with the cutting edge perpendicular to the handle. Two basic forms of an adze are the hand adze, a short <b>handled</b> <b>tool</b> swung with one hand, and a foot adze, a long <b>handled</b> <b>tool</b> capable of powerful swings using both hands, the cutting edge usually striking at foot or shin level. The blade of an adze is set at right angles to the tool's shaft (like a hoe or plane), in contrast to an axe's blade, which is in plane with the shaft. A similar, but blunt, tool used for digging in hard ground is called a mattock.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{document}} is to provide the design support information for the Vertical Fuel <b>Handling</b> <b>Tools,</b> developed {{for the removal of}} N Reactor fuel elements from their storage canisters in the K Basins storage pool and insertion into the Single Fuel Element Can for subsequent shipment to a Hot Cell for examination. Examination of these N Reactor fuel elements is part of the overall characterization effort.
