40|$|Railway {{vehicles}} {{are among the}} most complex dynamical systems in engineering due to the large number of degrees of freedom and the non-linear interaction between wheel and rail. The purpose of this research is to analyse the dynamic stability of a railway vehicle travelling on a tangent track at constant speed. As instability index, the establishment of a self-sustained limit cycle is considered. In reality, a limit cycle is almost always present. What separates stability from instability is the amplitude of such cycle. In fact, cycles characterised by small amplitudes can't endanger the vehicle's behaviour. This paper discusses both numerical integration methods of the non-linear equations of motion of the railway vehicle and the linear methods based on the <b>equivalent</b> <b>conicity</b> concept to assess the vehicle's critical velocity limit...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic {{interaction}} between a railway freight vehicle and a track switch is studied by simulations of vehicle dynamics. In particular, {{the influence of}} a stochastic spread (scatter) in traffic parameters on damage in the switch is assessed. The considered parameters are wheel profile and wheel–rail friction coefficient. To form a database for sampling, 120 wheel profiles from freight wagons in traffic have been measured and categorised with respect to wear. Among the investigated parameters, it is shown that <b>equivalent</b> <b>conicity</b> is the wheel profile parameter correlating best to damage in the switch and crossing panels. The influence of hollow worn wheels on damage is also investigated and it is found that such wheel profiles display a different running behaviour at the crossing transition. Convergence properties for samples of runs generated by Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) are compared to the corresponding properties obtained by pure random sampling. It is concluded that the LHS generated samples exhibit a smaller variance...|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} reduce the wheel profile wear of {{high-speed}} trains and extend the service life of wheels, a dynamic model for a high-speed vehicle was set up, in which the wheelset was regarded as flexible body, and the actual measured track irregularities and line conditions were considered. The wear depth of the wheel profile was calculated by the well-known Archard wear law. Through this model, the influence of the wheel profile, primary suspension stiffness, track gage, and rail cant on the wear of wheel profile were studied through multiple iterative calculations. Numerical simulation results show that the type XP 55 wheel profile has the smallest cumulative wear depth, and the type LM wheel profile has the largest wear depth. To reduce the wear of the wheel profile, the <b>equivalent</b> <b>conicity</b> of the wheel should not be too large or too small. On the other hand, a small primary vertical stiffness, a track gage around 1, 435 – 1, 438 mm, and a rail cant around 1 : 35 – 1 : 40 are beneficial for dynamic performance improvement and wheel wear alleviation.|$|E
40|$|This work {{describes}} an analytical approach {{to determine what}} degree of accuracy is required {{in the definition of}} the rail vehicle models used for dynamic simulations. This way {{it would be possible to}} know in advance how the results of simulations may be altered due to the existence of errors in the creation of rolling stock models, whilst also identifying their critical parameters. This would make it possible to maximize the time available to enhance dynamic analysis and focus efforts on factors that are strictly necessary. In particular, the parameters related both to the track quality and to the rolling contact were considered in this study. With this aim, a sensitivity analysis was performed to assess their influence on the vehicle dynamic behaviour. To do this, 72 dynamic simulations were performed modifying, one at a time, the track quality, the wheel-rail friction coefficient and the <b>equivalent</b> <b>conicity</b> of both new and worn wheels. Three values were assigned to each parameter, and two wear states were considered for each type of wheel, one for new wheels and another one for reprofiled wheels. After processing the results of these simulations, it was concluded that all the parameters considered show very high influence, though the friction coefficient shows the highest influence. Therefore, it is recommended to undertake any future simulation job with measured track geometry and track irregularities, measured wheel profiles and normative values of wheel-rail friction coefficient...|$|E

40|$|The turnout (Switch & Crossing) {{is a vital}} {{component}} in railway networks as it provides flexibility to traffic operation by allowing trains to switch between tracks. The flexibility comes at a cost as the common lack of a transition curve in the diverging route together with the variation and discontinuities in rail profiles result in higher rail degradation rates than in regular track. In this thesis, dynamic interaction between vehicle and turnout is studied using numerical tools for multibody dynamics with focus on laying a foundation for robust optimization of turnout geometry. Considering a stochastic spread in traffic parameters, quantitative and qualitative estimates of rail profile degradation are computed. The influence of wheel profile wear on wheel–rail interaction in a turnout is studied, and it is concluded that <b>equivalent</b> <b>conicity</b> is the wheel profile characterization parameter with the best correlation to rail damage of the investigated parameters. In addition, the influence of hollow worn wheels on rail damage is investigated and {{it is found that}} such wheel profiles display a significantly different and potentially more harmful running behaviour at the crossing. The influence of wheel–rail friction coefficient is studied and it is shown that friction correlates strongly to lateral contact forces and wear in the diverging route. Wheelset steering, considering the turnout specific configuration of rail profiles and the presence of check rails, is discussed. One of the track models studied is a discretized mass-spring-damper model with nine degrees-of-freedom. This track model can be tuned to capture the large phase delay at low frequencies found in measurements of dynamic track stiffness, while remaining sufficiently resilient at higher frequencies. Good agreement between the simulation model and field measurement data has been observed. It is concluded that the use of more resilient rail pads can reduce wheel–rail impact loads during the crossing transition...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2012 Raylı taşıt dinamiği demiryolu mühendisliğinin temel konularından biridir. Farklı fiziksel koşullar altında aracın davranışı yapılan dinamik analizler sonucu belirlenir. Aracın dinamiğini etkileyen temel parametreler taşıtın boyutları, kütle ve atalet değerleridir. Ayrıca süspansiyon elemanlarının yay ve sönüm katsayıları ve bu elemanların bağlantı noktalarının konumları da taşıt dinamiğini etkilmektedit. Taşıtın davranışını belirleyen bir diğer önemli parametre ise tekerlek ve ray profilidir. Tekerlek profilinin yuvarlanma düzlemi aracın düz yoldaki davranışını, flanş bölgesi ise kurptaki davranışını belirlemektedir. Metro ve hafif metro sistemlerinde tekerlek profili standartlar tarafından belirlenirken tramvay hatlarında ise işletmeci tarafından hat karakteristikleri ve işletme hızı gibi parametreler göz önünde bulundurularak belirlenmektedir. Tekerlek profili tasarımında dikkat edilmesi gereken ana husus konfor-güvenlik ilişkisinin doğru bir şekilde kurulmasıdır. Bu tez kapsamında raylı taşıt dinamiğinde önemli bir etkiye sahip olan tekerlek-ray teması üzerinde durulmuştur. Öncelikle Simpack yazılımında bir tramvay aracına ait 52 serbestlik dereceli dinamik model oluşturulmuştur. Daha sonra üç farklı tekerlek profili (TTP 1, TTP 2 ve TTP 3) modele eklenerek performansları incelenmiş ve karşılaştırılmıştır. Yapılan kararlılık, konfor ve kurp analizleri sonucunda TTP 2 ve TTP 3 profilleri konfor, yanal kararlılık açısından daha iyi sonuçlar verdiği gözlemlenmiştir. Kurp analizinde ise her üç profilinde güvenlik sınırlarını aşmamakla birlikte TTP 1 profilinin deray oranı daha düşük çıkmıştır. Yapılan bu tez ile modellenen tramvay aracının dinamik sürüş performansı bakımından en uygun tekerlek profili belirlenmiştir. Önerilen tekerlek profili ile konfor iyileştirilirken güvenlik standartlar tarafından belirlenen sınırlar içerisinde tutulmuştur. Metro and trams {{are one of}} {{the most}} cost {{effective}} vehicles in urban transportation. This is due to the low energy loss of metal on metal contact between wheels and rail. The advantageous characteristics in passenger carrying capacity and punctual operation make them more preferable than other urban transportation vehicles. They also offer a secure and comfortable trip for passengers. Metro and trams differ from other railway vehicles in operating conditions. Some main differences are the distance between stations, passenger capacity, braking and acceleration. Especially tram vehicles’ design inputs vary considerably since they are operated within the motorway traffic and with respect to city’s weather condition and geological specification. The selection of railway wheel and rail profiles is a challenge that has faced engineers since the dawn of the railway age. This thesis is mainly focused on rail-wheel profile contact which has a very important effect on railway vehicle dynamics. Metro and light rail vehicle wheel profiles are determined with respect to the predefined standards. However in tramways, it is determined by the operator considering the parameters such as line characteristics and operating speeds. Increasing axle loads, the presence of tight curves and light vehicles causes more complexitty for wheel/rail interface. These differing requirements are all oriented toward same targets; increased durability and comfort, reduction of maintenance costs, and increased safety. First of all, the dynamic model is created in Simpack software. The dynamic behaviour of a railway vehicle can be analysed using three types of analysis: • linear analysis, for the evaluation of the vehicle model eigenvalues; • stability analysis, used for the evaluation of the critical speed of the vehicle; • dynamic analysis, to simulate the actual behaviour of the railway system in operating conditions. The complete vehicle–track system can be split up into three subsystems: vehicle, wheel–rail contact, and track. The first step in every vehicle computer simulation is to set up a mechanical model appropriate to fulfil the desired simulation task. The multibody system (MBS) approach is a powerful and widely used method for this procedure, especially if the vehicle’s running behaviour is to be analyzed. The typical model of a railway vehicle is composed of the three sub-assemblies: the car body, the front bogie, trailer bogie and the rear bogie. Each bogie consists of the bogie frame, bolster, and two wheelsets. In this research, the car body and bogie frames, as well as the wheelsets are treated as rigid bodies and are defined by their mass–inetria characteristics (mass, moments of inertia, and the position of the centre of gravity), and by the relative position of the bogies with respect to the car body itself. Each rigid body has six degrees of freedom; three translations and three rotations. All bodies are connected by linear and non-linear springs and dampers, representing the primary and secondary suspensions. Primary and secondary suspensions are often used to support the carbody components and to provide vibration isolation. The primary suspension is connected between the wheelset and the side frame, while the secondary suspension is connected between the bolster and the side frame. The primary and secondary suspensions consist of spring, damper, bump stop and trailer arm. Difference between contact areas is presented by creating contact models for these three wheel profiles. Mode frequencies and dampings are investigated by applying the modal analysis to investigate the stability of the system. Resonance characteristics of components such as carbody, bogie and bolster are observed with the aid of their mode shapes. Stability of the system indicated by investigating the damping values and root-loci figures for a speed range of 0 - 70 km/h. On the other hand, after the analysis of the most critical curve area under operating conditions, <b>equivalent</b> <b>conicity</b> did not exceed the limits. Lateral irregularity is applied to the straight track to see the lateral movement of the carbody during maximum velocity of 70 km/h. Lateral movement of the carbody is absorbed in time after the analysis and stability of the vehicle is proved for these conditions. Superiority of the TTP 2 and TTP 3 wheel profiles is shown by the lateral stability analysis results. Comfort index from EN 12299 standard is compared between three wheel profiles by using a track irregularity which is defined in ORE B 176 and also superiority of the TTP 2 and TTP 3 is investigated with respect to comfort for passengers. L/V ratio, creepages, creep forces and lateral forces are compared for each wheel profile by curve analysis for the most critical curve in the line. As a result, altough none of the wheel profiles exceed the safety limit, TTP 1 profile yields much safer results. On the other hand, TTP 2 and TTP 3 generates lower lateral forces during the curve than TTP 1 profile. Therefore, TTP 2 and TTP 3 profiles have superior characteristcs for maintenance costs and irregularites on wheel and rail profile. To sum up, TTP 1 profile is safer for curve analysis and TTP 2 and TTP 3 profiles have superior lateral stability and comfort characteristics and less lateral forces generated acting on the rail. Basic principle for wheel profile design process is building the relation between comfort and safety in a proper way. Comfort should be improved while safety limits should not be exceeded for designed wheel profile. With respect to these informations, optimization can be done on the wheel tread and flange area to get better results for safety and comfort. Additionally, profiles can be compared for wear conditions. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
