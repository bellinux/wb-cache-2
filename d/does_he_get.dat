500|$|The episode {{ends with}} talking head {{interview}} with Jim, discussing Dwight's actions for Michael. There {{is a quick}} cut-away to a visual of Jim talking to Pam in the breakroom. He states, [...] "I just don't get it. What <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> out of that relationship?" [...] The camera emphasizes his own relationship with Pam, and why he went through with the jinx all day.|$|E
500|$|After the loss, Rodman made {{headlines}} by directly accusing Celtics star Larry Bird of being overrated {{because he was}} white: [...] "Larry Bird is overrated {{in a lot of}} areas. ...Why <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> so much publicity? Because he's white. You never hear about a black player being the greatest". Although teammate Thomas supported him, he endured harsh criticism, but avoided being called a racist because, according to him, his own girlfriend Anicka [...] "Annie" [...] Bakes was white.|$|E
500|$|What {{happens in}} that moment? [...] Does he despair? [...] <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> {{up and go}} on? For me, {{there is no more}} {{defining}} moment for a character. We tried to do this with almost all the characters in this episode: , Laura, Kara, Lee. We ripped everything out from under them then sat back to see what they would do. What were their individual breaking points? And if they did break, would they stay broken or grope toward a recovery? ...|$|E
60|$|No sooner <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> it pointed {{correctly}} than he {{uttered a}} cry of surprise.|$|R
60|$|Where <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> that word? I do {{not think}} I have ever used it.|$|R
5000|$|Mario Borsalino, called Buddy, he {{is desperate}} to get laid, but when <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> Despinoza [...] "Despie" [...] Carabella pregnant.|$|R
2500|$|Steven Moffat {{has said}} that {{reference}} {{will be made to}} Peter Capaldi's previous appearances in the Whoniverse during his tenure as the Twelfth Doctor: [...] "The face is not set from birth. It’s not like he was always going to be one day Peter Capaldi. We know that’s the case because in The War Games he has a choice of faces. So we know it’s not set, so where <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> those faces from? They can’t just be randomly generated because they've got lines. They've aged. When he turns into Peter he’ll actually have lines on his face. So where did that face come from?” In [...] "Deep Breath" [...] (2014), the Doctor and several other characters speculate about where his new face came from, given that it has lines from frowning. The Doctor considers aloud that it is a face he recognises from somewhere, but due to post-regenerative trauma, he cannot place it. In [...] "The Girl Who Died" [...] (2015), he concludes that he subconsciously chose the face as a reminder of his decision {{to save the life of}} Caecilius (also played by Capaldi) in [...] "The Fires of Pompeii" [...] (2008) and to remind him to save people even with possible historical consequences by doing so.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will let}} that pass for the present," [...] said the Senator. [...] "There he is, however {{he may be}} paid. How <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> there?" [...] Now {{it was the fact}} that Mr. Mainwaring's living had been bought for him with his wife's money,--a fact of which Mr. Gotobed was not aware, but which he would hardly have {{regarded}} had he known it. [...] "How <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{he is just}} roaming around I {{wonder how}} he manages to live," [...] said Dave. [...] "And where <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> all that outlandish outfit?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How in {{the world}} <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> out?" [...] cried Fanny, {{steadying}} herself after a start that nearly sent all three tumbling down stairs.|$|R
6000|$|... "So it is," [...] responded Bob Grenwood, the {{quartermaster}} of {{the school}} battalion. [...] "How in the world <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> on that horse?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> hold {{of all the}} specimens, as {{he calls}} them? What {{business}} has he poking his nose down people's wells and waterbutts?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Before we go any further," [...] he said, [...] "let's get {{one thing}} clear. Who is this Mr. Scobell? How <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> {{mixed up in}} this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But where <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> the money?" [...] Vera demanded. [...] "Only to-day, just now, have I {{learned that}} he paid the bill for white paper--one hundred and forty dollars." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, oh, that's his answer! Where <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> his airs? Who am I, then, to {{be treated}} like that? Shall I beg to a man who has begged to me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Milray gave a {{start of}} alarm. She said, to gain time: [...] "How <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> here? I {{supposed}} {{he was in}} Germany with his--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} admit {{that your father}} has got it?" [...] said the girl, noting these signs with some disapproval. [...] "How <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Two days ago!" [...] {{repeated}} Roger. [...] "Then Porton {{must have}} come here right after leaving the hotel in Lamont. How ever <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Louis,' she said, 'in {{the case}} of a woman marrying a man much younger than herself, <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> to dislike her, even if there has been a social {{advantage}} to him in the union?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And has Philip Carey set up {{for himself}} at Allonfield? <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> any practice? I have a great mind to be ill; it would be such a joke to be doctored by Master Philip!" ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{the mention}} of hay, Peter Rabbit sat bolt upright {{and his eyes were}} wide open with astonishment. [...] "Did you say hay?" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Where under the sun <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> hay way up there, and what does he want of it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Maybe he {{had some}} trouble with that young fellow,” {{returned}} Pardell. “Say, <b>do</b> you know <b>he’s</b> a queer stick? Where <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> those diamonds <b>he</b> offered for his passage?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{the little}} Chevalier, <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> himself wet?" [...] said the {{confidential}} maid, [...] "poor little fellow! {{it was like}} to give him his death of cold." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, yes; and how <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> on there? I cannot {{conceive}} poor Johnny keeping holiday {{with the}} earl and his sister. How <b>did</b> <b>he</b> behave to them, {{and how did}} they behave to him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, in course {{nobody knows}} where he is," [...] {{retorted}} the skipper; [...] "that's where it is. No sooner <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> a small windfall--leastwise, his mother gets it--than he cuts the trawlers, an' all his old friends {{without so much as}} sayin' `Good-bye,' an' goes off to Lunnon or somewheres, to set up for a gentleman, I suppose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is a bad}} business, Bastow, and {{it seems}} to me that two or three years in prison would be the best thing for him, as he will not take up the only trade open to him. At any rate, it would {{separate}} him from his evil associates, and give you peace while he is behind the bars. Where <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> his money?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are {{you trying}} to stuff me with nonsense?" [...] asked Johnny Chuck indignantly. [...] "How can he fasten his nest {{to the side of}} a chimney unless there's a little shelf to put it on? And if he never alights, how <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> the little sticks to make a nest of? I'd just like to know how you expect me to believe any such story as that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Alas! that I {{must say}} it. I believe {{my son to}} be that basest of creatures, a fortune-hunter. How <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> that money left to him by another woman?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fact!" [...] {{continued}} Boyle eagerly. [...] "It's {{the same}} card I {{stuck in his}} hat--there's the greasy mark in the corner. How the devil <b>did</b> it--how <b>did</b> <b>HE</b> <b>get</b> here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dead! he's {{bound to}} be dead, under all that weight. But how the dickens <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> into the cart? Guess we didn't shovel him in, eh; we'd have seen him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course we}} do. Not {{that you have}} to laugh at Dr. Kennicott so much, but MY man, heavens, now there's a rare old bird! Reading story-books when he ought to be tending to business! 'Marcus Westlake,' I say to him, 'you're a romantic old fool.' And <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> angry? He does not! He chuckles and says, 'Yes, my beloved, folks do say that married people grow to {{resemble}} each other!' Drat him!" [...] Mrs. Westlake laughed comfortably.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is what {{my father}} says, but what <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>get?</b> Strong stuff to drink; dresses for those women down there, and {{sometimes}} pearls, jewels and other things for me which I do not want. I have a box full of them set in ugly gold, or loose which I cannot use, and if I put them on, who is there to see them? That clever half-breed, Thomaso--for he is clever in his way, faithful too--or the women down there--no one else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We hear, Mrs. Skim; {{and quite}} {{agree with you}} that he knows very little about us and our affairs," [...] {{answered}} one of the swallows with a shrill chirp, like a scornful laugh. [...] "We work harder than he does any day. Did he build his own house, I should like to know? <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> his daily bread for himself? How many of his neighbors does he help? How much of the world does he see, and who is the happier for his being alive?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'How <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> hold of Crow's leg in {{the first}} place?' Mr. Jay asked {{as if he were}} a regular judge, and had a right to pry into other people's business.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't want {{to think}} of it," [...] the girl answered, {{frowning}} slightly. [...] "It makes my head ache. Nobody has a right to so much money. How <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I shouldn't {{care how}} soon. When {{a man has}} worked as I have <b>done,</b> <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> about tired at my age. I suppose I'd better be down at the committee-room about ten to-morrow?' ...|$|R
