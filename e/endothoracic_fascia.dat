50|$|The <b>endothoracic</b> <b>fascia</b> is {{the layer}} of loose {{connective}} tissue deep to the intercostal spaces and ribs, separating these structures from the underlying pleura. This fascial layer is the outermost membrane of the thoracic cavity. The <b>endothoracic</b> <b>fascia</b> contains variable amounts of fat.It becomes more fibrous over the apices of the lungs as the suprapleural membrane. It separates internal mammary artery from pleura.|$|E

30|$|Posteriorly, <b>endothoracic</b> and transversalis <b>fasciae</b> are {{continuous}} {{behind the}} diaphragm, at lumbocostal arches and the aortic and oesophageal hiatus, providing communication point between mediastinum and retroperitoneum (Fig.  7 b) [21].|$|R
5000|$|It {{refers to}} a {{thickening}} of connective tissue that covers the apex of each human lung. It {{is an extension of}} the <b>endothoracic</b> <b>fascia</b> that exists between the parietal pleura and the thoracic cage.|$|E
50|$|The parietal pleura is {{differentiated}} into {{regions in}} line with the location in the thorax. The ‘’cervical pleura’’ (or ‘’cupula of pleura’’) is in the region of the cervical vertebrae extending beyond the apex of the lung and into the neck. The ‘’costal pleura’’ lines the inner surfaces of the ribs and the intercostal muscles and are separated from them by <b>endothoracic</b> <b>fascia.</b> An extension of the <b>endothoracic</b> <b>fascia</b> known as the suprapleural membrane covers the apex of each lung in a thickened layer of connective tissue. The ‘’diaphragmatic pleura’’ lines the convex surface of the diaphragm. The ‘’mediastinal pleura’’ attaches to the other organs in the mediastinum and forms the separating lateral wall.|$|E
50|$|The {{chest wall}} has 10 layers, namely skin, {{superficial}} fascia, deep fascia, serratus anterior, layer for ribs (containing intercostal muscles), and <b>endothoracic</b> <b>fascia</b> from superficial to deep. However, the muscular layers {{vary according to}} the region of the chest wall. For example, they may include muscles like pectoralis major or latissimus dorsi.|$|E
50|$|Inferiorly, the prevertebral layer blends {{with the}} <b>endothoracic</b> <b>fascia</b> {{peripherally}} and fuses with the anterior longitudinal ligament centrally at approximately {{the level of}} the T3 vertebra. Due to this, the superior extent of the retropharyngeal space is essentially continuous with the root of the neck, and is termed the danger space. It extends laterally as the axillary sheath.|$|E
5000|$|In human anatomy, the pleural cavity is {{the thin}} fluid-filled {{space between the}} two {{pulmonary}} pleurae (visceral and parietal) of each lung. A pleura is a serous membrane which folds back onto itself to form a two-layered membranous pleural sac. The outer pleura (parietal pleura) {{is attached to the}} chest wall, but is separated from it by the <b>endothoracic</b> <b>fascia.</b> The inner pleura (visceral pleura) covers the lungs and adjoining structures, including blood vessels, bronchi and nerves. The pleural cavity {{can be viewed as a}} potential space because the two pleurae adhere to each other (through the thin film of serous liquid) under all normal conditions.|$|E
5000|$|The stellate {{ganglion}} (or cervicothoracic ganglion) is {{a sympathetic}} ganglion {{formed by the}} fusion of the inferior cervical ganglion and the first thoracic ganglion, which exists in 80% of cases. Sometimes the second and the third thoracic ganglia are included in this fusion. Stellate ganglion is relatively big (10-12 x 8-20 mm) compared to much smaller thoracic, lumbar and sacral ganglia and it is polygonal in shape (lat. stellatum meaning star-shaped). Stellate ganglion {{is located at the}} level of C7, anterior to the transverse process of C7 and the neck of the first rib, superior to the cervical pleura and just below the subclavian artery. It is superiorly covered by the prevertebral lamina of the cervical fascia and anteriorly in relation with common carotid artery, subclavian artery and the beginning of vertebral artery which sometimes leaves a groove at the apex of this ganglion (this groove can sometimes even separate the stellate ganglion into so called vertebral ganglion). Relations of the apex of the stellate ganglion:• covered by the <b>endothoracic</b> <b>fascia</b> and parietal pleura• right stellate ganglion is in relation with right brachiocephalic vein anteriorly• right stellate ganglion is in relation with sternal part of subclavian artery anteriorly• laterally: first intercostal artery• medially: longus colli muscle ...|$|E
30|$|According to Terminologia Anatomica the fasciae of {{the trunk}} are listed as parietal, extraserosal and visceral. The fascia parietalis {{is defined as a}} sheet or band of fibrous tissue which lies outside the parietal layer of a serosa and lines the wall of a body cavity; the parietal fascia of the thorax is the <b>endothoracic</b> <b>fascia</b> and that of the abdomen is the endoabdominal fascia. The <b>endothoracic</b> <b>fascia</b> is firmly {{attached}} to the costal pleura, and posteriorly blends with the prevertebral fascia [18].|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{report the}} 7 th {{case of a}} {{traumatic}} extrapleural hematoma that developed in an anticoagulated patient with a thoracic blunt trauma and rib fractures, and required an emergency surgical treatment. Extrapleural hematoma is a rare and life-threatening condition characterized by a collection of blood between the pleura parietalis and the <b>endothoracic</b> <b>fascia.</b> Related symptoms and chest x-ray findings are not characteristic and may present several hours after the injury, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment. Etiological, surgical and prognostic implications of this finding are briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|An {{injection}} {{of a local}} anesthetic in the paravertebral region produces an analgesic field {{on the same side}} of the body. However, the spread of the anesthetic solution in the <b>endothoracic</b> <b>fascia</b> in the paravertebral region is not clearly elucidated yet. One point in question about the block in this region is whether the local anesthetic spreads from the thoracic to the lumbar level of the paravertebral region. We investigated how the anesthetic fluid traveled to the lumbar paravertebral region. A dye was injected into the paravertebral region in the thoracic cavity of cadavers to study the spread of the anesthetic solution. The dye spread into the abdominal cavity through the medial and lateral arcuate ligaments of the diaphragm while the dye also spread in the chest cavity in the <b>endothoracic</b> <b>fascia</b> posterior to the parietal pleura. In the abdominal cavity, the dye was found to have spread so widely in the transversalis fascia that the subcostal, iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal, genitofemoral, lateral femoral cutaneous and femoral nerves, and the celiac ganglion were involved. Although the cadavers were fixed with formalin solution and although there was no blood circulation in the cadavers, the spread of the dye was comparable to the analgesic region produced by anesthetic solution in the human study in previous studies（ref. 3, 4 ）. The functional structure around the vertebral column is yet to be elucidated. Fig. 1 Diagram illustrating placement of needle for dye injection. The needle tip reaches the endothoraci...|$|E

40|$|Technical aspects in skeletonization of the {{internal}} thoracic artery using an ultrasonic scalpel Objective: To describe the technique and evaluate the immediate results of using an ultrasonic scalpel in the skeletonization of {{the internal}} thoracic artery for coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. Methods: From January 2000 to October 2006, 188 patients were submitted to coronary artery bypass grafting with the internal thoracic artery skeletonized using an ultrasonic scalpel. Seventy-one patients (37. 8 %) were women. The patients ’ ages varied from 28 to 81 years old.

40|$|Objective: The {{internal}} thoracic artery (ITA) is the conduit {{of choice}} for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). To avoid spasm of the ITA various topical vasodilators have been suggested either intraluminally or by topical application. In order to describe the best vasodilating agent for preparation of the ITA, a randomized double-blind placebo controlled clinical work was performed {{in a group of}} CABG patients. Methods: Three hundred consecutive patients submitted for elective first time coronary artery bypass grafting were randomly subdivided into five groups. The first measurement was performed shortly after the {{internal thoracic artery}} was dissected from the chest wall and the second just prior to performing distal anastomosis to the left anterior descending coronary artery. During the time interval between the two measurements topical vasodilator has been injected into the <b>endothoracic</b> <b>fascia</b> of the ITA using the following drugs: papaverine 2 mg/ml, nitrogly-cerin 1 mg/ml, nitroprusside 0. 5 mg/ml, mixed solution include sodium nitroprusside (1 mg/ml) and diltiazem (0. 5 mg/ml) and normal saline 0. 9 %. Results: No statistically {{significant differences were found between}} the groups in respect to age, body surface area, cardiopulmonary bypass time, cross clamping time, and time interval between the two flow measurements. Mean arterial pressure at the time of the first and second internal thoracic artery flow measurements did not show statistically significant differences either within or between the groups. In all five groups, the free flow of the internal thoracic artery increased significantly with time. However, no statistically significant differences were shown between the five groups with respect to second flow. Conclusions: We suggest that preparation of the ITA by topical vasodilators injection into the <b>endothoracic</b> <b>fascia</b> does not result in a significantly superior free flow than placebo...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveThe {{internal}} thoracic artery {{is frequently}} used as an arterial graft for coronary bypass. Spasms of {{internal thoracic artery}} may contribute to early myocardial ischemia. To prevent vasospasm and increase the blood flow, some vasodilatory agents (such as carbon dioxide or papaverine) are used. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the combined effects of carbon dioxide and papaverine versus either alone on the blood flow of the internal thoracic artery. MethodsOne hundred patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (28 women and 72 men) with similar characteristics were randomly divided into four groups. We used the classic technique without any vasodilatory management before surgery in group 1, papaverine injection into the <b>endothoracic</b> <b>fascia</b> in group 2, and carbodissection technique in groups 3 and 4. Initial free flows of the internal thoracic arteries were measured after cutting of the vessel. After the first measurement, the ITA pedicles were washed with papaverine solution and wrapped with gauze in the first and fourth groups. Blood flow measurements were repeated 15 minutes later in all groups. ResultsWhen vasodilatory management was applied during excision, the blood flows were significantly increased relative to group 1. The mean blood flows reached a significantly higher level in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 at the second measurements. In groups 2 and 3, the increase at the first measurements compared to the first group’s level was continuously high, but no additional increase was observed between the first and second measurements. In groups 1 and 4, regardless of whether a previous vasodilatory management was present, the increases measured at repeated measurements were significant versus each group’s first measurements (P <. 05). ConclusionsVasodilatory management, such as injection of papaverine into <b>endothoracic</b> <b>fascia</b> or carbon dioxide insufflation applied during excision, increased the free blood flows of internal thoracic artery pedicles. Exogenously applied papaverine produces an additional and continuous vasodilatation regardless of whether a vasodilatory intervention was previously applied...|$|E
40|$|Inadequate {{flow and}} limited length can be {{reasons for not}} using the {{internal}} mammary artery graft for myocardial revascularization. Several methods have been described to obviate these limitations, but each has disadvantages that contraindicate their application on a routine basis. Herein we describe what {{to the best of}} our knowledge is a new surgical technique of harvesting the internal mammary artery graft wherein the <b>endothoracic</b> <b>fascia</b> is incised longitudinally along the artery. In our experience, this surgical maneuver enables an increase in hematic flow (average, 30. 6 %) and in length of the graft (average, 10 %) with reduced risk of damaging the arterial intima. This technique also enables the surgeon to detect the presence of atheromatous plaques and of parietal hematomas of the internal mammary artery wall. Moreover, we have observed a drastic reduction in the incidence of arterial spasms after use of this technique...|$|E
30|$|The parietal pleura is {{attached}} to the thoracic wall by the <b>endothoracic</b> <b>fascia.</b> This fascia lines the diaphragm superiorly, while the transversalis fascia, which is the innermost layer of the endoabdominal fascia, lines its inferior surface [18]. The costal insertions of the diaphragm on the inner surfaces of the lower six ribs and their cartilages provide a separation between theses sleeves. However, three anterior defects in the diaphragmatic attachments provide blending of the two fasciae: [1] one in the midline, between the two slips of sterna origin of the diaphragm that arise from the back of xiphoid process and [2] two parasagittal gaps between the sternal and costal origins of the diaphragm—the sternocostal triangles or foramen of Morgagni, through which run internal mammary vessels that continue in the abdomen as the superior epigastric vessels (Fig.  7 a and b). Therefore, air/disease processes that follow these diaphragmatic defects may enter a space between the transversalis fascia and the parietal peritoneum, the properitoneal (or preperitoneal) space, and spread through it laterally to the flank, arriving into the retroperitoneum[18, 20, 21].|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{effects of}} a local {{anesthetic}} delivered through a catheter inserted in the extrapleural region by a surgeon and an analgesic agent given systemically on pain after thoracotomy were assessed. MethodsThe patients in group I (n = 25) had a catheter inserted between the parietal pleura and the <b>endothoracic</b> <b>fascia</b> by a surgeon, and 0. 5 % bupivacaine was given through this catheter. Another 25 patients (group II) had metamizol given intravenously. Respiratory function tests, arterial blood gases, range of shoulder motion, and postoperative pain were evaluated for each group. Bupivacaine and metamizol were given just before finishing the thoracotomy and then repeated every 4 hours for 3 days. ResultsThere was no statistical difference in arterial blood gases between the groups (P >. 05). There were statistically {{significant differences in the}} respiratory function tests, range of shoulder motion, and visual analogue scale (P <. 05) between the groups. Group I had fewer complications than group II. There was no mortality in either group. ConclusionsBupivacaine given through a catheter to the extrapleural region before finishing thoracotomy is substantially beneficial for the prevention of postoperative pain and reduction of postoperative complications...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Malignant pleural {{mesothelioma}} {{is an ideal}} model for testing new locoregional multimodality approaches because of its aggressive local behavior. METHODS: This study was planned to investigate the feasibility, safety, and pharmacokinetics of a multimodality therapy including an operation, pleural space perfusion (60 minutes) with cisplatin (100 mg/m 2), hyperthermia (41. 5 degrees C), and postoperative radiotherapy (55 Gy to chest wall incisions). The effects {{of the extent of}} resection and perfusion temperature on cisplatin pharmacokinetics were evaluated. Ten patients with epithelial or mixed, stage I or II, malignant {{pleural mesothelioma}} underwent the following procedures: group A (3 patients), pleurectomy/decortication and normothermic pleural space antineoplastic perfusion; group B (3 patients), pleurectomy/decortication and hyperthermic perfusion; and group C (4 patients), pleuropneumonectomy and hyperthermic perfusion. Operations were selectively applied depending on tumor extent. Platinum levels were serially measured by atomic absorption in systemic blood, perfusate, lung, and <b>endothoracic</b> <b>fascia.</b> RESULTS: The overall procedure was completed in every case, without any death or toxicity. No lung damage was demonstrated after treatment. Major complications included 1 wound infection and 1 diaphragmatic prosthesis displacement. The mean peak platinum plasma levels were reached within 45 to 60 minutes after perfusion was started. Systemic drug concentrations were greater after pleurectomy/decortication than after pleuropneumonectomy (P =. 006). The local tissue/perfusate ratio of platinum concentrations tended to be higher after hyperthermic perfusion rather than normothermic perfusion. CONCLUSION: This multimodality approach is feasible, pharmacokinetically advantageous, and safe enough to undergo further clinical investigations...|$|E

40|$|In six male anesthetized, tracheotomized, and {{mechanically}} ventilated rabbits, we imaged subpleural alveoli under microscopic view (60 ×) {{through a}} "pleural window" obtained by stripping the <b>endothoracic</b> <b>fascia</b> {{and leaving the}} parietal pleura intact. Three different imaging scale levels were identified for the analysis on increasing stepwise local distending pressure (P ld) up to 16. 5 cmH 2 O: alveoli, alveolar cluster, and whole image field. Alveolar profiles were manually traced, clusters of alveoli of similar size were identified through a contiguity-constrained hierarchical agglomerative clustering analysis and alveolar surface density (ASD) was estimated {{as the percentage of}} air on the whole image field. Alveolar area distributions were remarkably right-skewed and showed an increase in median value with a large topology-independent heterogeneity on increasing P ld. Modeling of alveolar area distributions on increasing P ld led to hypothesize that absolute alveolar compliance (change in surface area over change in P ld) increases fairly linearly with increasing initial alveolar size, the corollary of this assumption being a constant specific compliance. Clusters were reciprocally interweaved due to their highly variable complex shapes. ASD was found to increase with a small coefficient of variation (CV < 25 %) with increasing P ld. The CV of lung volume at each transpulmonary pressure was further decreased (about 6 %). The results of the study suggest that the considerable heterogeneity of alveolar size and of the corresponding alveolar mechanical behavior are homogenously distributed, resulting in a substantially homogenous mechanical behavior of lung units and whole organ...|$|E
40|$|Thoracic {{paravertebral}} block (TPVB) {{consists of}} an injection of local anaesthetic alongside the thoracic vertebra close to where the spinal nerves emerge from the intervertebral foramen. Clinically TPVB can be accomplished either as a single-injection or as a multiple-injection. It {{can also be used}} as a continuous paravertebral infusion through an indwelling catheter for continuous pain relief. However compared to an epidural block, TPVB is less well understood and not commonly used for anaesthesia and or analgesia in anaesthetic practice. I hypothesized that TPVB is effective for producing unilateral segmental thoracic anaesthesia and managing pain of unilateral origin from the thorax. The objective of this thesis was to develop the technique of TPVB so that it becomes a useful technique for anaesthesia and pain management. So to test my hypothesis a series of clinical studies were performed on 416 patients (396 adults and 20 young infants), presenting for anaesthesia and or acute pain management, to evaluate various aspects of TPVB, namely; clinical application, anatomy of the thoracic paravertebral space, technique and safety, and pharmacology of local anaesthetic after TPVB.
