2500|$|Prince Rogers Nelson {{was born}} on June 7, 1958 in Minneapolis, to Mattie Della (née Shaw; 1933–2002) and John Lewis Nelson (1916–2001). His parents were both African-American and his family ancestry is {{centered}} in Louisiana, with all four of his grandparents hailing from that state. Prince's father was a pianist and songwriter, {{and his mother was}} a jazz singer. Prince was given his father's stage name, Prince Rogers, which his father used while performing with a jazz group called the Prince Rogers Trio. In 1991, Prince's father told A Current Affair, [...] "I named my son Prince because I wanted him to do everything I wanted to do." [...] Prince's childhood nickname was Skipper. Prince has said he was [...] "born epileptic" [...] and [...] "used to have seizures" [...] when he was young. He also said, [...] "My mother told me one day I walked in to her and said, 'Mom, I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sick</b> anymore,' and she said, 'Why?' and I said, 'Because an angel told me so.'" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was very}} chill and dark. She rose and groped {{about for a}} light. Her teeth chattered with cold {{and it seemed to}} her she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sick.</b> She dressed hurriedly and went down.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear child. (Do {{you really}} like it? I keep it for my best friends.) My dee-ar child, I thought I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sick</b> there and then. He knocked every ounce of wind out of me--the angel! But I must really go.' ...|$|E
60|$|Mary Erskine {{succeeded in}} her design of sending {{into the village}} {{by one of the}} workmen, and Dr. Keep came about nine o'clock He {{prescribed}} for Albert, and prepared, and left, some medicine for him. He said he hoped that he <b>was</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very <b>sick,</b> but he could tell better in the morning when he would come again.|$|R
6000|$|... "My--the {{lady that}} I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> marry--has <b>been</b> <b>sick,</b> {{ever since the}} first of October, and I haven't {{had a chance to}} look up any kind of work. But she's better now; and I've heard of this place I can get. I don't like to trouble you; but--everything's gone--I've got my mother down here helping take care of her; and I must do something. I don't know just when I can pay you back; but I'll do it sometime." ...|$|R
3000|$|Well, you’re always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> worry. You <b>were</b> <b>sick</b> once, and you’re afraid you’re gonna get <b>sick</b> again. You <b>are</b> gonna {{be worried}} about it a lot. When you get that sick, you don’t wanna get that sick again. [19 -year-old Caucasian female] [...]...|$|R
60|$|He {{stared in}} front of him with a {{doubtful}} expression, like a man who is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sick,</b> and then, in an instant, every muscle seemed to give way, he shuddered, his head flopped, and White held a dead man in his arms.|$|E
6000|$|... "Queer smell--yes! Like bilge or a rank swamp. It was {{distinctly}} nauseating; when I {{came out}} I {{felt as if}} I had just been <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sick.</b> I shall try back on my visit and see if I can recall any more of what I saw or felt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bev, {{fill the}} kettle {{with water and}} put it on to heat," [...] she said in a {{resigned}} tone. [...] "If Dan's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sick</b> again we've got to be ready for it. I wish mother was home, that's all. I hope she'll never go away again. Dan King, you just wait till I tell her of the way you've acted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I <b>'m</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> down <b>sick!</b> I knew I was! I knew it! And what <b>am</b> I <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do, off {{in such a}} {{place as}} this? No one to nurse me, or look after Bella! I should think you would be {{satisfied}} now, Grace, with the result of your conscientiousness: you were so very sure that Mr. Libby <b>was</b> wanting <b>to</b> flirt with me that you drove us to our death, because you thought he felt guilty and <b>was</b> trying <b>to</b> fib out of it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Guitarist Gary Holt {{commented on}} the bands {{intentions}} for the album's cover: [...] "We wanted to portray the violence of man at its finest, so we started with our {{own version of the}} Leonardo da Vinci sketch of Vitruvian Man, but done the ‘EXODUS’ way! I was pointed in the direction of Colin Larks of Rainsong Design for the cover and he killed it! To me, the artwork represents man and his affinity for bloodshed, ignorance, and all-around ability <b>to</b> <b>be</b> led like sheep to the slaughter. The image fits the songs on this record perfectly. The whole layout <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> as <b>sick</b> as the record itself!" ...|$|R
6000|$|By {{the end of}} {{two weeks}} Father and Mother were slowly going mad with the quiet of their room, and Lulu was getting a little tired of her {{experiment}} in having a visible parental background. She began to let Mother do the sock-darning--huge uninteresting piles of Harris Hartwig's faded mustard-colored cotton socks, and she snapped at Father when he was restlessly prowling about the house, [...] "My head aches so, I'm sure it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a <b>sick</b> headache, and I do think you might {{let me have a}} nap instead of tramping and tramping till my nerves get so frazzled that I could just shriek." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{glanced at}} the others and saw that they, too, were frightened. Stephen turned very white. I {{thought that he was}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sick</b> again, as he was after he drank the coffee out of the wrong bowl on the day we entered Mazitu-land. Brother John stroked his white beard and muttered some {{invocation}} to Heaven to protect him. Hans exclaimed in his abominable Dutch: ...|$|E
60|$|He was {{not very}} well {{for two or three}} days afterward, and his mother let him stay out of school to see whether he was really <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sick</b> or not. When he went back most of the fellows had {{forgotten}} that he had been going to run off with the circus. Some of them that happened to think of it plagued him a little and asked how he liked being a circus actor.|$|E
6000|$|About noon, I was {{standing}} on the upper deck, when I saw Rectus coming toward me, looking very pale. He was generally a dark sort of a boy, and it made a good deal of difference in him to look pale. I was sure he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sick,</b> at last,--although it was rather queer for him to knock under when the voyage was pretty nearly over,--and I began to laugh, when he said to me, in a nervous sort of way: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Standing," [...] he said slowly, [...] "I've {{given you}} all the rope I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to.</b> I <b>am</b> <b>sick</b> and tired of your stubbornness. My {{patience}} is exhausted. Doctor Jackson says you <b>are</b> in condition <b>to</b> stand ten days in the jacket. You can figure your chances. But I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> give you your last chance now. Come across with the dynamite. The moment it is in my hands I'll take you out of here. You can bathe and shave and get clean clothes. I'll let you loaf for six months on hospital grub, and then I'll put you trusty in the library. You can't ask me <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fairer with you than that. Besides, you're not squealing on anybody. You are {{the only person in}} San Quentin who knows where the dynamite is. You won't hurt anybody's feelings by giving in, and you'll <b>be</b> all <b>to</b> the good from the moment you do give in. And if you don't--" ...|$|R
5000|$|At 2000 Sydney Games, she won two {{gold medals}} in the 100 m T46 and 200 m T46 events, and a bronze medal in the 400 m T46 event. [...] She felt under {{enormous}} pressure going into the Sydney Games due to being the 200 m title holder from Atlanta. She said [...] "“I did feel a lot of pressure, but the greatest pressure I felt was the pressure I put on myself. I remember before my final in the 200m, I felt like I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> physically <b>sick.</b> I’d never felt like that before. My usual mindset was ‘whatever happens happens." [...] She won two more gold medals at the 2004 Athens Games in the 100 m and 200 m T46 events. She was an Australian Institute of Sport scholarship holder in the lead up to the Athens Games and was coached by Iryna Dvoskina. [...] She retired in 2005.|$|R
6000|$|She {{somewhat}} coldly suffered Mrs. Erwin to {{kiss her}} and smooth her hair, while she began {{to talk with her}} of her grandfather and her aunt at home. [...] "But this <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> home <b>to</b> you now," [...] said Mrs. Erwin, [...] "and I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let you <b>be</b> <b>sick</b> for any other. I want you to treat me just like a mother, or an older sister. Perhaps I shan't be the wisest mother to you in the world, but I mean <b>to</b> <b>be</b> one of the best. Come, now, bathe your eyes, my dear, and let's go to dinner. I don't like to keep your uncle waiting." [...] She did not go at once, but showed Lydia the appointments of the room, and lightly indicated what she had caused <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done, and what she had done with her own hands, to make the place pretty for her. [...] "And now shall I take your letter, and have your uncle post it this evening?" [...] She picked up the letter from the table. [...] "Hadn't you any wax to seal it? You know they don't generally mucilage their envelopes in Europe." ...|$|R
6000|$|He seemed however to be uneasy and restless, and he moaned now {{and then}} as if in pain. Mary Erskine stood leaning over him for some time, with a countenance filled with anxiety and concern. She then turned away, saying to herself, [...] "If Albert is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sick</b> and to die, {{what will become of}} me?" [...] She kneeled down upon the floor {{at the foot of the}} bed, crossed her arms before her, laid them down very quietly upon the counterpane, and {{reclined}} her forehead upon them. She remained in that position for some time without speaking a word.|$|E
60|$|And sure enough, {{the moment}} her bows passed beyond the pier, the sea struck her, and tossed her like an eggshell, and the deck, from stem to stern, was drenched in a moment, and running with floods {{as if she}} had been under water. For a few moments H. and I both enjoyed the motion. We stood amidships, she in her shawl, I in a great {{tarpauling}} which I had borrowed of Jack, and every pitch sent the spray over us. We exulted that we were not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sick.</b> Suddenly, however, so suddenly that it was quite mysterious, conscience smote me. A profound, a deep-seated remorse developed itself just exactly in the deepest centre of the pit of my stomach.|$|E
60|$|I {{suppose it}} must have been the whisky. Anyhow Italians can never bear hard bitterness. The {{jewellers}} looked distressed, the bounders looked down their noses, half exulting even now, and half sheepish, being caught. The third of the commis voyageurs, the gentle one, made large eyes and was terrified that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sick.</b> He represented a certain Italian liqueur, and he modestly asked us to take a glass of it. He went with the waiter to secure the proper brand. So we drank--and it was good. But he, the giver, sat with large and haunted eyes. Then he said he would go to bed. Our bounder gave him various advice regarding seasickness. There was a mild swell on the sea. So he of the liqueur departed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, wot <b>are</b> we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do?" [...] ses Ginger. [...] "I’m {{beginning}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sick</b> of {{the sight}} of ’im. ’Ave we got to lead ’im about all day on a bit o’ string?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Sure, but Pete went home. His mother <b>'s</b> {{supposed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sick.</b> Gosh, these clerks you get nowadays--overpay 'em {{and then}} they won't work!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Redfield's voice {{interrupted}} with hearty clamor. [...] "And now, Miss Virginia, you go {{back and}} rustle some breakfast for us all. Swenson, bring the horses in and harness my team; I'm going to take these women down the canon. And, Ross, you'd better saddle up as soon as you feel rested and ride across the divide, and go into camp in that little old cabin by the dam above my house. You'll have to be sequestered for a few days, I reckon, till we see how you're coming out. I'll telephone over to the Fork and have the place made ready for you, and I'll have the doctor go up there to meet you and put you straight. If you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sick</b> we'll want you where we can look after you. Isn't that so, Lee Virginia?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{question}} lurked in Pony's {{mind all}} the time that they were waiting for the potatoes to bake, but somehow he could not get it out. He did not feel very well, and he tried to forget his bad feelings by listening {{as hard as he could}} to Jim Leonard's stories. Jim kept taking the potatoes out to see if they were done enough, and he began to eat them while they were still very hard and greenish under the skin. Pony ate them, too, although he was not hungry now, and he did not think the ashes were as good as salt on them, as Jim pretended. The potato he ate seemed to make him feel no better, and at last he had to tell Jim that he was afraid he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sick.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I had champagne, too," [...] said Hadden, [...] "but I {{kept that}} {{in case of}} sickness, until I didn't seem to be <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sick,</b> and then I opened a pint every Sunday. Used to sleep all morning, then breakfast with my pint of fizz, and lie in a hammock and read Hallam's 'Middle Ages.' Have you read that? I always take {{something}} solid to the islands. There's no doubt I did the thing in rather a fine style; {{but if it was}} gone about a little cheaper, or there were two of us to bear the expense, it ought to pay hand over fist. I've got the influence, you see. I'm a chief now, and sit in the speak-house under my own strip of roof. I'd like to see them taboo me! They daren't try it; I've a strong party, I can tell you. Why I've had upwards of thirty cowtops sitting in my front verandah eating tins of salmon." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} old man, [...] "I asked the captain about the {{seasickness}}, and he says she ain't nigh so likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sick</b> as she would on the steamer; the motion's more regular, and she won't have {{the smell of the}} machinery. That's what he said. And he said the seasickness would do her good, any way. I'm sure I don't want her <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sick</b> any more than you do, Maria." [...] He added this like one who has been unjustly put upon his defense.|$|R
60|$|The smooth, moon-like, expressionless virgin face, rather {{pale and}} touching, rather frightened, of the girl-child. A perfect face from a mediaeval picture. It moves one strangely. Why? It is so unconscious, {{as we are}} conscious. Like a little muted animal it sits there, in distress. She is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sick.</b> She goes into the {{corridor}} and is sick--very sick, leaning {{her head like a}} sick dog on the window-ledge. Jupiter towers above her--not unkind, and apparently feeling no repugnance. The physical convulsion of the girl does not affect him as it affects us. He looks on unmoved, merely venturing to remark that she had eaten too much before coming on to the train. An obviously true remark. After which he comes and talks a few common-places to me. By and by the girl-child creeps in again and {{sits on the edge of}} the seat facing Juno. But no, says Juno, if she is sick she will be sick over me. So Jupiter accommodatingly changes places with the girl-child, who is thus next to me. She sits on the edge of the seat with folded little red hands, her face pale and expressionless. Beautiful the thin line of her nut-brown eyebrows, the dark lashes of the silent, pellucid dark eyes. Silent, motionless, like a sick animal.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{wrong for}} once," [...] he said, with a bitter laugh. [...] "The {{exasperating}} {{part of it}} is that Farnaby has said neither Yes nor No. The oily-whiskered brute--you haven't seen him yet, have you?--began by saying Yes. 'A man like me, the heir of a fine old English family, honoured him by making proposals; he could wish no more brilliant prospect for his dear adopted child. She would fill the high position that was offered to her, and fill it worthily.' That was the fawning way in which he talked to me at first! He squeezed my hand in his horrid cold shiny paw till, I give you my word of honour, I felt as if I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sick.</b> Wait a little; you haven't heard the worst of it yet. He soon altered his tone--it began with his asking me, if I had 'considered the question of settlements'. I didn't know what he meant. He had to put it in plain English; he wanted to hear what my property was. 'Oh, that's soon settled,' I said. 'I've got five hundred a year; and Regina is welcome to every farthing of it.' He fell back in his chair as if I had shot him; he turned--it was worse than pale, he positively turned green. At first he wouldn't believe me; he declared I must be joking. I set him right about that immediately. His next change was a proud impudence. 'Have you not observed, sir, in what style Regina is accustomed to live in my house? Five hundred a year? Good heavens! With strict economy, five hundred a year might pay her milliner's bill and the keep of her horse and carriage. Who is to pay for everything else--the establishment, the dinner-parties and balls, the tour abroad, the children, the nurses, the doctor? I tell you this, Mr. Goldenheart, I'm willing to make a sacrifice to you, as a born gentleman, which I would certainly not consent to in the case of any self-made man. Enlarge your income, sir, to no more than four times five hundred pounds, and I guarantee a yearly allowance to Regina of half as much again, besides the fortune which she will inherit at my death. That will make your income three thousand a year to start with. I know something of domestic expenses, and I tell you positively, you can't do it on a farthing less.' That was his language, Rufus. The insolence of his tone I can't attempt to describe. If I hadn't thought of Regina, I should have behaved in a manner unworthy of a Christian--I believe I should have taken my walking-cane, and given him a sound thrashing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... {{who knows}} is there {{anything}} the matter with my insides or have I something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last I Whit Monday yes its only about 3 weeks I {{ought to go to}} the doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that white thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick Dr Collins for womens diseases on

around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what I did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows what else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself 4 and 5 times a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about lo minutes as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very 1st opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like my bed God here we are as bad as ever after 16 years how many houses were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard street and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our 4 sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres Georges church bells wait 3 quarters the hour l wait 2 oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if he has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I dont know deceitful men all their 20 pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell

me in Holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know

ago now yes hed be 11 though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the 7th card after that the 10 of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the 3 queens and the 8 of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and 2 red 8s for new garments look at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I wonder is he too young hes about wait 88 I was married 88 Milly is 15 yesterday 89 what age was he then at Dillons 5 or 6 about 88 I suppose hes 20 or more Im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 I hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face I would too in 1/2 a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I suppose never dream of washing it from I years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age Ill throw them the 1st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard comes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out Ill read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our 2 photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though ...|$|E
