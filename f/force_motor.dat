40|$|We {{introduce}} a new motor parameter imagery paradigm using clench speed and clench <b>force</b> <b>motor</b> imagery. The time-frequency-phase features are extracted from mu rhythm and beta rhythms, and the features are optimized using three process methods: no-scaled feature using "MIFS" feature selection criterion, scaled feature using "MIFS" feature selection criterion, and scaled feature using "mRMR" feature selection criterion. Support vector machines (SVMs) and extreme learning machines (ELMs) are compared for classification between clench speed and clench <b>force</b> <b>motor</b> imagery using the optimized feature. Our results show that {{no significant difference in}} the classification rate between SVMs and ELMs is found. The scaled feature combinations can get higher classification accuracy than the no-scaled feature combinations at significant level of 0. 01, and the "mRMR" feature selection criterion can get higher classification rate than the "MIFS" feature selection criterion at significant level of 0. 01. The time-frequency-phase feature can improve the classification rate by about 20 % more than the time-frequency feature, and the best classification rate between clench speed motor imagery and clench <b>force</b> <b>motor</b> imagery is 92 %. In conclusion, the motor parameter imagery paradigm has the potential to increase the direct control commands for BCI control and the time-frequency-phase feature has the ability to improve BCI classification accuracy.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we {{investigate}} the phase information for classification between clench speed and clench <b>force</b> <b>motor</b> imagery for BCI applications. The multivariate extensions of empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) {{are used to}} decompose EEG data into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Then, the phase information is got by transforming IMFs into analytic signal using Hiblert transforms. Six feature types are compared in the paper for channel C 3, Cz and C 4 : the amplitude of IMFs, the power of IMFs, the amplitude of the corresponding analytic signal, the instantaneous phase of the analytic signal, the instantaneous frequency of the analytic signal and the phase-locking value (PLV) between two channels. The support vector machine with 5 -fold crossvalidation is used to classify clench speed motor imagery from clench <b>force</b> <b>motor</b> imagery. The results show that for some subjects the instantaneous phase can get the best results, while PLV never performs best compared with other features. The minimum classification error rate of 0. 25 is reached in our research. Copyright © 2014 IFSA Publishing, S. L...|$|E

Linear kernal support vector machine (SVM) classification between clench <b>force</b> <b>motor</b> imagery and clench speed motor imagery using four concentration feature types (oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, totalhemoglobin, and HbD) is implemented. Our results demonstrate that feature discretization using Chi 2 algorighm and feature optimization using ‘MIFS’ (Mutual Information Feature Selection) criterion can improve the classification accuracy by more than 35 %.

40|$|Aileron {{actuators}} are pivotal {{components for}} aircraft flight control system. Thus, the fault diagnosis of aileron actuators is vital in {{the enhancement of}} the reliability and fault tolerant capability. This paper presents an aileron actuator fault diagnosis approach combining principal component analysis (PCA), grid search (GS), 10 -fold cross validation (CV), and one-versus-one support vector machine (SVM). This method {{is referred to as}} PGC-SVM and utilizes the direct drive valve input, <b>force</b> <b>motor</b> current, and displacement feedback signal to realize fault detection and location. First, several common faults of aileron actuators, which include <b>force</b> <b>motor</b> coil break, sensor coil break, cylinder leakage, and amplifier gain reduction, are extracted from the fault quadrantal diagram; the corresponding fault mechanisms are analyzed. Second, the data feature extraction is performed with dimension reduction using PCA. Finally, the GS and CV algorithms are employed to train a one-versus-one SVM for fault classification, thus obtaining the optimal model parameters and assuring the generalization of the trained SVM, respectively. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, four types of faults are introduced into the simulation model established by AMESim and Simulink. The results demonstrate its desirable diagnostic performance which outperforms that of the traditional SVM by comparison...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of electrohydraulic floating-disc valves at the University of Surrey {{started in the}} early 1980 's. The progress {{in the last ten}} years since then has shown that floating-disc valves have the advantages of fast response time, reliable operation, simple configurations, few critical dimensions with no precision sliding surfaces, leading to low cost design and manufacture. They have great potential to fill the gap between conventional solenoid valves and high precision servo valves. However, limitations existed in previous designs hindering further development; for instance relatively large moving mass, low hydraulic stiffness, difficulty of installing springs and poor null position when operating in proportional control mode. The work presented in this thesis concentrates on improving the disc valve electromagnetic characteristics, hydraulic stiffness, electric power consumption, operating reliability, valve size and cost. A novel diaphragm-disc <b>force</b> <b>motor</b> has been successfully developed through this research. The theoretical study and experimental work has shown that the <b>force</b> <b>motor</b> has the features of high spring stiffness, fast response, improved accuracy and linearity, and miniaturised size. By implementing a pair of permanent ring magnets, the diaphragm-disc <b>force</b> <b>motor</b> also has the advantages of lower electric power consumption, dual-lane for fail safety operation, and higher control accuracy. Due to the use of conventional mild steel instead of Remco B soft iron as the coil magnetic conductor material, the valve manufacturing cost has been further reduced. Above all, this novel configuration shows good prospects of competing with the existing torque motor due to its low cost and simple construction. The research described also involves designing and testing two prototype disc valves for specific applications. A single disc pilot valve associated with the diaphragm configuration and permanent magnet arrangement has been built for use in an aviation engine fuel supply system. It has a dual-lane operating mode with a valve size of 58 x 50 x 50 millimetres, which is the smallest valve yet made in the disc valve family. The initial test results showed that the valve has good linearity and a bandwidth of 60 Hz in a blocked-load condition. Another successfully built valve is an improved version of a position controlled double-disc valve for use in vehicle semi-active suspension systems. It has been demonstrated that using proportional plus derivative electronic network compensation, the valve can operate continually in the whole damper control domain with the characteristics of balanced fluid forces and low electric power consumption...|$|E
