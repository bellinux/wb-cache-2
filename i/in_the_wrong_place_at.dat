25|$|The United States Department of Defense removed {{seventeen}} {{soldiers and}} officers from duty, and eleven soldiers {{were charged with}} dereliction of duty, maltreatment, aggravated assault and battery. Between May 2004 and March 2006, these soldiers were convicted in courts-martial, sentenced to military prison, and dishonorably discharged from service. Two soldiers, Specialist Charles Graner and PFC Lynndie England, were sentenced to ten and three years in prison, respectively. Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, the commanding officer of all detention facilities in Iraq, was reprimanded and demoted {{to the rank of}} colonel. Several more military personnel who were accused of perpetrating or authorizing the measures, including many of higher rank, were not prosecuted. It is reported that most inmates were innocent of the crimes they were accused of and were simply detained due to them being <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> the wrong time.|$|E
25|$|The counterattack failed, as two battalions in {{the centre}} found the German {{shelling}} {{too heavy for}} them to attack, and Monro eventually ordered a halt. Wilson wanted to court martial the two acting battalion commanders for “funk”, after hearing the view {{of one of the}} actual COs (who had been acting in command of the brigade) that the attack had been feasible. Major Armytage, a staff officer from GHQ, visited the sector on 25 May and reported back that Brigadier-General Kellett (99th Brigade, but acting GOC of 2nd Division) was incompetent and “in complete ignorance of the situation”. Haig wrote to Monro (27 May) that Wilson should be asked to explain and that IV Corps, formerly “the most efficient in the army” “had much decreased in military value” and Wilson “had failed as a commander in the field”. Charteris also visited IV Corps HQ on 27 May, and reported back that officers there were “downhearted” and thought the Germans and French better fighters than the British – Wilson later claimed that the officers had been “pulling Charteris’ leg” as he talked of “sweeping victories” within two months. Wilson was almost “degummed” (sacked) but was saved by a strong report in his favour by Monro. The two acting battalion commanders were not court-martialled, but Kellett was never promoted to command a division. Jeffery argues that Wilson was, like many “unsuccessful” corps commanders, largely <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> the wrong time, and that Haig’s animosity for Wilson was a factor.|$|E
500|$|Film scholar Kevin Wetmore {{noted the}} film's {{portrayal}} of {{violence as a}} reflection of its contemporary culture, writing: [...] "Death is a random act in post-9/11 horror—the result of being <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> the wrong time, as the cliché goes. Unlike in eighties slasher horror, for example, where engaging in negative behavior such as drinking, doing drugs, having premarital sex are often forerunners to being killed by the killer(s); , death is random and unrelated to one's behavior." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{around this}} time, Sarria {{was arrested for}} {{solicitation}} in a sting operation at the St. Francis Hotel. Sarria maintained his innocence, stating that the arresting officer knew him personally. [...] "But {{they had to make}} an example of somebody... I was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> the wrong time." [...] Nonetheless, he was convicted and subjected to a large fine. Sarria, understanding that his conviction meant he could never become certified as a teacher, dropped out of college. Unsure of how to find work, he took the advice of a drag performer named Michelle and entered a drag contest at an Oakland bar called Pearl's. Sarria took second place, winning a two-week performance contract at the bar at $50 a week. [...] "I decided then to be the most notorious impersonator or homosexual or fairy or whatever you wanted to call me–and you would pay me for it." [...] Returning to San Francisco, he picked up some small singing jobs while still cocktail waiting at the Black Cat.|$|E
500|$|While Lillian and Victor Cordero {{had done}} their jobs well (before hiring them, Baird had made several {{attempts}} to employ U.S. citizens, but none had worked out), on January 22 the INS said {{it sought to}} question them and very likely deport them. [...] The couple had previously separated and {{were about to be}} divorced. [...] Lillian Cordero agreed to leave the country and return to Peru, under a 30-day [...] "voluntary departure" [...] program. [...] Victor Cordero first went into hiding, hoping to stay in the country; his lawyer said he had been <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> the wrong time and that, [...] "He doesn't understand why he's being singled out." [...] But by January 29, he too had voluntarily left the U.S. for Peru. [...] Neither of them ever appeared in the media.

Morley's friend said, [...] "This is the second time he was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> the wrong time, but {{for all of us here}} today he will be in the right place at the right time, which is a very special place in all of our hearts."

2500|$|Asked why {{he never}} sought the presidency, Rayburn {{said that he}} was [...] "born <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> the wrong time" [...] to {{undertake}} a national campaign. Rayburn was Speaker at a time that the greater power in the House rested with committee chairmen. He was himself readily accessible to members; historian Anthony Champagne of the University of Texas at Dallas, a Rayburn scholar, views the Speaker as a [...] "bridge between the northern and southern members" [...] of the Democratic Party. Champagne recalled a report that Rayburn so understood the House that he was [...] "married" [...] to the body and could [...] "feel the sentiment of the members" [...] by merely being in their presence. He was careful to fight his own battles, Champagne said. Rayburn was a mentor to such younger members as Richard Bolling of Missouri, Wilbur D. Mills of Arkansas, Carl Albert of Oklahoma, and Homer Thornberry and Jack Brooks, both of Texas. He was also readily accessible to constituents, who were invited to come to his home in Bonham and visit without prior notice.|$|E
2500|$|The {{television}} series {{differs from the}} film versions in one fundamental aspect: Nikita (Peta Wilson) is innocent. She is not a killer, nor a drug user, just a homeless young woman <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> the wrong time. Section One —an elite, top-secret counter-terrorism organization— sets Nikita up {{to be accused of}} murdering a police officer and {{sentenced to life in prison}} where she supposedly commits suicide and is brought into Section One. Because Nikita will be killed (or [...] "cancelled") if she fails to comply, she is forced to carry out the organization's ruthless methods of fighting terrorism, while attempting to keep her moral integrity intact. This personal struggle becomes the primary conflict of the series. A key scene in the two theatrical films involves Nikita's first assignment —to murder a VIP in a crowded restaurant. Although the Nikita of the {{television series}} eventually does become, by necessity, a ruthless killer, in the television version of this first mission she uses her ingenuity to avoid having to kill the VIP (whereas the film versions of the character complete the assignment). However, despite the machinations of others in power around her, Nikita retains her compassion and humanity.|$|E
2500|$|The fan outcry and {{subsequent}} discussions over Lexa's death led several screenwriters and producers {{to sign the}} Lexa Pledge, a pledge promising to treat gay and lesbian characters in future plotlines with consideration to their emotional and cultural impact. Some have argued that this stifles creativity {{and the freedom to}} develop characters and stories, while others have welcomed the debate, even if they have not signed the pledge. Although Rothenberg said he was [...] "very sorry for not recognizing [...] as fully as [...] should have", he would have still killed off Lexa; he would have written {{it in a way that}} does not perpetuate the trope, such as death after sex. He said that while he understands the argument that Lexa should have had a heroic death, having such a powerful character die by a stray bullet was more realistic because it signifies that anyone can be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> the wrong time. Javier Grillo-Marxuach, who wrote the episode, said, [...] "I don't think that the failure here was to discuss , the failure was to recognize the cultural impact it would have outside the show [...] I am grateful for the tidal wave that came down on me. The activism that goes on online is [...] important." ...|$|E
