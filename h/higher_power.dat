Exercising proper selection of packaging component could improve the life time of <b>high</b> <b>power</b> LED. In this work, {{the significance of the}} heat slug geometry on the heat dissipation of <b>high</b> <b>power</b> LED was addressed through simulation analysis. The heat slug geometries were varied in order to compare the heat dissipation of the <b>high</b> <b>power</b> LED. Ansys version 11 was utilized for the simulation. The heat dissipation of the <b>high</b> <b>power</b> LED was evaluated in terms of junction temperature, von Mises stress and thermal resistance.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a hybrid PV-battery grid connected system suitable for <b>high</b> <b>power</b> PV <b>power</b> applications. <b>High</b> <b>power</b> PV systems have impressive voltage fluctuation {{with regards to}} their maximum power point voltage. Using DC/DC converters to regulate this voltage is inefficient in <b>high</b> <b>power</b> systems as it adds an extra power conversion stage. On the other hand switching frequency, voltage stress as inverter limitations and power quality issues {{should be considered in}} <b>high</b> <b>power</b> applications. Central PV structures because of low efficiency and high cost inverters are not suitable for <b>high</b> <b>power</b> systems. Maximum power extraction from PV together with active and reactive injected power control is another challenge in <b>high</b> <b>power</b> system. Z-source multilevel inverter for PV arrays together with battery energy storage systems is a suitable solution for <b>high</b> <b>power</b> application. This paper proposes a control strategy for this hybrid system. A simulation with PSCAD has been done to validate the control strategy. Simulation results show how proposed control and topology satisfies <b>high</b> <b>power</b> requirements for PV grid connected systems...|$|R

In addition to standard demons, the player can ally with one human companion, with three being available on the first playthrough and a fourth unlocking during the second. When the player or their human partner dies in battle, they are granted a Guardian Spirit, who revives them at the last save point and teaches them new skills and alter the player's stats. The Guardian's specialties affect how stats are changed: a <b>higher</b> <b>power</b> ranking will raise the player's strength, but lower magic will decrease their Magic Point meter.

5|$|In {{order to}} achieve even <b>higher</b> <b>power</b> levels in ytterbium-based fiber systems. all factors of the fiber must be considered. These can be {{achieved}} only via optimization of all the ytterbium fiber parameters, ranging from the core background losses to the geometrical properties, {{in order to reduce}} the splice losses within the cavity. Power scaling also requires optimization of matching passive fibers within the optical cavity. The optimization of the ytterbium-doped glass itself through host glass modification of various dopants also plays a large part in reducing the background loss of the glass, improvements in slope efficiency of the fiber, and improved photodarkening performance, all of which contribute to increased power levels in 1 µm systems.|$|E
5|$|Much {{progress}} has been made in the power scaling lasers and amplifiers produced with ytterbium (Yb) doped optical fibers. Power levels have increased from the 1kW regimes due to the advancements in components as well as the Yb-doped fibers. Fabrication of Low NA, Large Mode Area fibers enable achievement of near perfect beam qualities (M2<1.1) at power levels of 1.5 kW to greater than 2 kW at ~1064 nm in a broadband configuration. Ytterbium-doped LMA fibers also have the advantages of a larger mode field diameter, which negates the impacts of nonlinear effects such as stimulated Brillouin scattering and stimulated Raman scattering, which limit the achievement of <b>higher</b> <b>power</b> levels, and provide a distinct advantage over single mode ytterbium-doped fibers.|$|E

5|$|In his Critique of Pure Reason, German philosopher Immanuel Kant {{stated that}} no {{successful}} argument for God's existence arises from reason alone. In his Critique of Practical Reason {{he went on}} to argue that, despite the failure of these arguments, morality requires that God's existence is assumed, owing to practical reason. Rather than proving the existence of God, Kant was attempting to demonstrate that all moral thought requires the assumption that God exists. Kant argued that humans are obliged to bring about the summum bonum: the two central aims of moral virtue and happiness, where happiness arises out of virtue. As ought implies can, Kant argued, it must be possible for the summum bonum to be achieved. He accepted that it is not within the power of humans to bring the summum bonum about, because we cannot ensure that virtue always leads to happiness, so there must be a <b>higher</b> <b>power</b> who has the power to create an afterlife where virtue can be rewarded by happiness.|$|E
5|$|The VFD {{controller}} is a solid-state {{power electronics}} conversion system consisting of three distinct sub-systems: a rectifier bridge converter, a direct current (DC) link, and an inverter. Voltage-source inverter (VSI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below) {{are by far}} {{the most common type of}} drives. Most drives are AC-AC drives in that they convert AC line input to AC inverter output. However, in some applications such as common DC bus or solar applications, drives are configured as DC-AC drives. The most basic rectifier converter for the VSI drive is configured as a three-phase, six-pulse, full-wave diode bridge. In a VSI drive, the DC link consists of a capacitor which smooths out the converter's DC output ripple and provides a stiff input to the inverter. This filtered DC voltage is converted to quasi-sinusoidal AC voltage output using the inverter's active switching elements. VSI drives provide <b>higher</b> <b>power</b> factor and lower harmonic distortion than phase-controlled current-source inverter (CSI) and load-commutated inverter (LCI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below). The drive controller can also be configured as a phase converter having single-phase converter input and three-phase inverter output.|$|E

Alistair, aware of this, recalls an empty field where he was at, a few blocks from where his fiancée died, and plans to use this field where only the vegetation will die out from his arrival. Walter tells Alistair how to correct the mistake that caused him to jump to the train but warns him of the other consequences that changing events will bring, explaining that stealing Peter from the parallel universe has left him wracked with regret.
