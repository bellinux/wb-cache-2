25|$|Resonance {{is simple}} to {{understand}} if {{the spring and}} mass are viewed as energy storage elements – with the mass storing kinetic energy and the spring storing potential energy. As discussed earlier, when the mass and spring have no external force acting on them they transfer energy back and forth at a rate equal to the natural frequency. In other words, to efficiently pump energy into both mass and spring requires that the energy source feed the energy in at a rate equal to the natural frequency. Applying a force to the mass and spring is similar to pushing a child on swing, a push is needed at the correct moment to make the swing get higher and higher. As {{in the case of}} the swing, the force applied need not be high to get large motions, but must <b>just</b> <b>add</b> energy to the system.|$|E

He explained, [...] "this David Foster song is quite demanding vocally, requiring a wider range and more power than anything else on the album. Yet Madonna more than lives up to the challenge, showing enough power and polish to make even Madonna-phobes admit she can sing.

[...] Billboards Keith Caulfield opined that the track [...] "showcased Madonna's newly-trained vocal abilities, which would prepare audiences for her lead role in the following year's Evita". AllMusic's Jose F.

[...] He added, [...] "Not {{one of the}} tracks is second-rate, and the best songs on Something to Remember rank among the best pop music of the '80s and '90s". Neil Strauss of The New York Times felt all the songs on the album [...] "cohere better than a greatest-hits package would" [...] and [...] "they tell a story of their own, of a voice and attitude that have hardened in the dozen years that have elapsed between the bubble-gum-chomping innocence of 1983's 'Crazy for You' and the tortured torch singing of the new 'You'll See'." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly commented: [...] "By placing her greatest-hit ballads ('Live to Tell', 'Crazy for You', 'Take a Bow', etc.) in a new context—that is, separated from her more attention-getting dance music—Madonna reinvigorates them, which is just what a good best-of compilation is supposed to do.

Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone agreed, viewing it as [...] "her hasty return" [...] to music lacking {{the energy of}} L.A.M.B. and in which [...] "she sounds exhausted." [...] The New York Times Jon Pareles commented that Stefani [...] "rebooks {{some of the same}} producers and repeats some of the old tricks with less flair", adding that [...] "superficiality is more fun when it doesn't get so whiny."

During the wedding ceremony, Rashad was [...] "given away" [...] to Ahmad by television husband Cosby, by whom {{the couple had}} first been introduced. Cosby assured Rashad {{that she would be}} allowed to remain on the show should she and Ahmad decide to have a baby, joking, [...] "We'll <b>just</b> <b>add</b> another Huxtable". Rashad became pregnant with their child during season three. To avoid having to add an infant to the main cast, extreme tactics were used to conceal the actress' pregnancy onscreen, such as confining Clair to bed or having her be out of town for several episodes at a time. Scooped out, the bed's mattress was specially constructed to prevent Rashad's growing stomach from being visible underneath the covers but ultimately resulted in the actress suffering a pinched nerve in her back. Rashad would also hide behind props such as kitchen tables, counters and jackets. In the episode [...] "Vanessa's Rich", Rashad uses a large teddy bear to hide her pregnancy while seated on the living room sofa, but the toy's origin and purpose within the episode remains unexplained. After giving birth to daughter Condola Rashad in 1986, Rashad managed to lose the weight she had gained while pregnant by the time season four premiered. Rashad's sister, actress Debbie Allen, appeared in an episode of The Cosby Show as Clair's personal trainer.|$|E

2500|$|One can enumerate all k-combinations {{of a given}} set S of n {{elements}} in some fixed order, which establishes a bijection from an interval of [...] integers with the set of those k-combinations. Assuming S is itself ordered, for instance S = { 1, 2, …, n }, there are two natural possibilities for ordering its k-combinations: by comparing their smallest elements first (as in the illustrations above) or by comparing their largest elements first. The latter option has the advantage that adding a new largest element to S will not change the initial part of the enumeration, but <b>just</b> <b>add</b> the new k-combinations of the larger set after the previous ones. Repeating this process, the enumeration can be extended indefinitely with k-combinations of ever larger sets. If moreover the intervals of the integers are taken to start at0, then the k-combination at a given place i in the enumeration can be computed easily from i, and the bijection so obtained {{is known as the}} combinatorial number system. It is also known as [...] "rank"/"ranking" [...] and [...] "unranking" [...] in computational mathematics.|$|E

2500|$|Most of Orthodox Judaism {{holds that}} the teachings of Kabbalah were {{transmitted}} from teacher to teacher, in a long and continuous chain, from the Biblical era until its redaction by Shimon ben Yochai. Some fully accept the claims that the Kabbalah's teachings are in essence a revelation from God to the Biblical patriarch Abraham, Moses and other ancient figures, but were never printed and made publicly available until {{the time of the}} Zohar's medieval publication. The greatest acceptance of this sequence of events is held within Haredi Judaism, especially Chasidic groups. R' Yechiel Michel Epstein (d.1908), and R' Yisrael Meir Kagan (d.1933) both believed in the authenticity of the Zohar. Rabbis Eliyahu Dessler (d.1953) and Gedaliah Nadel (d.2004) maintained that it is acceptable to believe that the Zohar was not written by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and that it had a late authorship."I approached Rav A [...] with some of the questions on the Zohar, and he responded to me - 'and what about nikud?
