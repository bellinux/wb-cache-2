5|$|Aggressive {{resemblance}} {{is used by}} predators or parasites. In special aggressive resemblance, {{the animal}} looks like something else, luring the prey or host to approach, for example when a flower mantis resembles {{a particular kind of}} flower, such as an orchid. In general aggressive resemblance, the predator or parasite blends in with the background, for example when a leopard <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to see in long grass.|$|E
5|$|As {{the world}} starts to globalize, it is {{accompanied}} by criticism of the current forms of globalization, which are feared to be overly corporate-led. As corporations become larger and multinational, their influence and interests go further accordingly. Being able to influence and own most media companies, it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> {{to be able to}} publicly debate the notions and ideals that corporations pursue. Some choices that corporations take to make profits can affect people all over the world. Sometimes fatally.|$|E
60|$|The {{victoria}} {{stopped in}} the side alley, bordered by the low walls of private grounds. We got out before a wrought-iron gateway which stood half open and walked up a circular drive {{to the door of}} a large villa of a neglected appearance. The mistral howled in the sunshine, shaking the bare bushes quite furiously. And everything <b>was</b> bright and <b>hard,</b> the air <b>was</b> <b>hard,</b> the light <b>was</b> <b>hard,</b> the ground under our feet <b>was</b> <b>hard.</b>|$|R

5|$|Due to the {{rarity of}} the {{syndrome}} itself, it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> {{to determine whether}} certain additional diseases are actually part of the syndrome. With a base population of possibly less than one thousand individuals, one or two outlying cases can skew the statistical population very quickly.|$|E
5|$|Elves {{appear in}} some place-names, though it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> {{to be sure}} how many as {{a variety of other}} words, {{including}} personal names, can appear similar to elf. The clearest English example is Elveden ("elves' hill", Suffolk); other examples may be Eldon Hill ("Elves' hill", Derbyshire); and Alden Valley ("elves' valley", Lancashire). These seem to associate elves fairly consistently with woods and valleys.|$|E
5|$|However, , {{with the}} {{exception}} of Spiroplasma mirum strain SMCA causing spongiform microcystic encephalitis in suckling rats, other researchers have been unable to duplicate these findings, casting doubt on the Spiroplasma hypothesis. In defense of the Spiroplasma hypothesis, Bastian pointed out that Spiroplasma <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to culture and that strain variation makes it hard to detect certain strains using PCR and other techniques, thus giving a false negative.|$|E

Under the assumption of the hardness of solving RSA or Discrete Log problem, it is shown that sets that <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> for class NP, and above, under manyone reductions <b>are</b> also <b>hard</b> under (non-uniform) 1 - 1, and size-increasing reductions. ...|$|R

5|$|It {{is likely}} {{that there is a}} strong genetic {{component}} to deferred gratification, though no direct link has been established. Since many complex genetic interactions are necessary for neurons to perform the simplest tasks, it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to isolate one gene to study this behavior. For this same reason, multiple genes are likely responsible for deferred gratification. Further research is necessary to discover the genetic corollaries to delayed gratification.|$|E

5|$|Manganese is a silvery-gray {{metal that}} resembles iron. It <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> and very brittle, {{difficult}} to fuse, but easy to oxidize. Manganese metal and its common ions are paramagnetic. Manganese tarnishes slowly in air and oxidizes ("rusts") like iron in water containing dissolved oxygen.|$|E
5|$|The role of stay-at-home dad may be {{difficult}} for men who feel as though they had no option. It <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> for these men to adapt from being a financial provider in the family to being a homemaker. Men who willingly choose to become a stay-at-home dad are much more satisfied with their role in the family.|$|E
5|$|The term is controversial, and its precise meaning <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to define. Some {{minority}} students are discouraged from achieving in school by the negative prejudices of ethnic peers; {{such a view}} has been expressed in articles in The New York Times, Time magazine, and The Wall Street Journal—and by public figures and academics across the political spectrum.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{trends in}} special needs {{education}} advocate {{the inclusion of}} children with special needs, including learners who <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> of hearing, in regular schools whenever possible. It is therefore necessary that the environment in the regular classrooms should be conducive to facilitate the interaction, learning, development, participation and working together of learners who <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> of hearing with their peers. For this to be realized, learners who <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> of hearing should freely interact with their hearing peers in various activities. As a natural phenomenon which occurs amongst human beings, interaction plays an integral part in everyday life. The interaction process involves what people actually do when they influence each other s behaviour. Many factors may hinder or sustain the interaction process. This study {{is an attempt to}} investigate the interaction between the learners who <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> of hearing and their hearing peers in regular classrooms in the Oshana Educational Region in Namibia and to describe the initiatives and their participation in classroom activities. A qualitative research and case study design were used. Data was collected by means of observation, with the help of video camera recording for capturing the data. Five learners who <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> of hearing in regular classrooms and were identified by the Hearing Assessment and Research Centre project were purposefully sampled. Three learners were from one school and two from another school. The results obtained indicate that learners who <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> of hearing interact favourably with their hearing peers despite the verbal communication barriers that exist. The results of this study call for the recognition of learners who <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> of hearing in regular classrooms. Proper planning as regards the inclusion and awareness of learners who <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> of hearing <b>is</b> needed. Sensitization of the public and education need to be vigorous so that the regional administrators, school counsellors, school community, parents and all other stakeholders know their roles and the needs of individuals with disabilities, and in particular those who <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> of hearing. A policy guideline will improve service at all levels of government...|$|R

5|$|Zirconium is a lustrous, greyish-white, soft, ductile and {{malleable}} metal that is solid at room temperature, though it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> and brittle at lesser purities. In powder form, zirconium is highly flammable, but the solid form {{is much less}} prone to ignition. Zirconium is highly resistant to corrosion by alkalis, acids, salt water and other agents. However, it will dissolve in hydrochloric and sulfuric acid, especially when fluorine is present. Alloys with zinc are magnetic at less than 35K.|$|E
5|$|Although it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to {{test the}} hearing of sharks, {{they may have a}} sharp sense of hearing and can {{possibly}} hear prey from many miles away. A small opening on each side of their heads (not the spiracle) leads directly into the inner ear through a thin channel. The lateral line shows a similar arrangement, and is open to the environment via a series of openings called lateral line pores. This is a reminder of the common origin of these two vibration- and sound-detecting organs that are grouped together as the acoustico-lateralis system. In bony fish and tetrapods the external opening into the inner ear has been lost.|$|E
