These facts provide evidence that C 3 is produced due to the regeneration of a soot forming sequence and leave it in ionic state.

These applications mostly include fields of air pollutant treatment, wastewater and drinking water decontamination, and thermal disposal of solid waste. The non-thermal plasmas used for environmental applications are mainly <b>high-pressure</b> <b>discharges,</b> such as DBDs, pulsed corona discharges, microwave plasmas, electron beams and dielectric packed bed reactors. An increasing number of investigations are devoted to the decomposition of nitrogen and sulphur oxides in flue gases, and of volatile organic compounds (VOC) emitted from various industrial processes. Many hazardous organic compounds are readily attacked by excited species, free radicals, electrons, ions and/or UV photons generated in DBDs. Moreover, investigations are going on to use dielectric barrier discharges (DBDs) for the generation of H 2 and elemental sulphur from H 2 S and for the conversion of the greenhouse gases CO 2 and CH 4 to liquid fuels.

40|$|We adopted laser Thomson {{scattering}} {{for measuring}} the electron density and the electron temperature of microwave plasmas produced in helium at the pressures higher than the atmospheric pressure. The electron density decreased while we observed {{the increase in the}} electron temperature with the pressure. These are reasonable results by considering the decrease in the reduced electric field, the dominant loss of electrons via three-body recombination with helium as the third body, and the production of electrons with medium energy via heavy particle collisions at the high gas pressure. The temporal variation of the electron temperature had the rise and the fall time constants of approximately 10 ns. The rapid heating and cooling of the electron temperature are due to the fast energy transfer from electrons to helium because of the high collision frequency in the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>discharge...</b>|$|E

The formation and development of discharge filaments in He/F 2 gas mixtures is completely different from that in Ne/F 2. Under the same start up conditions, discharges in Ne/F 2 are dominated by cathode hotspots where as no hot spots are visible in discharges in He/F 2 gas mixtures. However, the discharges in Ne/F 2 gas mixtures {{appear to be more}} uniform even though the discharge width decreases in time and hotspots are persistent on the cathode surface...|$|E

Local {{thermodynamic}} equilibrium is assumed with a single temperature for all species. The model consists of the coupled description of the balance equation for the plasma temperature with the radiation transport equation. The plasma composition is calculated according to the Guldberg–Waage, Boltzmann and Saha laws. These laws were supplemented by additional equations specifying the total pressure, constant element ratios and quasineutrality. The model takes into account atomic, molecular as well as continuum radiation. The broadening of the optically thick lines is approximated by Stormberg's approach.

40|$|A {{model of}} a near-cathode region in <b>high-pressure</b> arc <b>discharges</b> is {{developed}} {{in the framework of}} the hydrodynamic (diffusion) approximation. Governing equations are solved numerically in 1 D without any further simplifications, in particular, without explicitly dividing the near-cathode region into a space-charge sheath and a quasi-neutral plasma. Results of numerical simulation are reported for a very high-pressure mercury arc and an atmospheric-pressure argon arc. Physical mechanisms dominating different sections of the near-cathode region are identified. It is shown that the near-cathode space-charge sheath is of primary importance under conditions of practical interest. Physical bases of simplified models of the near-cathode region in <b>high-pressure</b> arc <b>discharges</b> are analysed. A comparison of results given by the present model with those given by a simplified model has revealed qualitative agreement; the agreement is not only qualitative but also quantitative {{in the case of an}} atmospheric-pressure argon plasma at moderate values of the near-cathode voltage drop.

40|$|Low-pressure {{discharge}} lamps obey {{a set of}} physical laws that {{are different from those}} of <b>high-pressure</b> <b>discharge</b> lamps. In this paper, these differences are addressed. Based on a recently developed HID lamp model frame, a semi-theoretical fluorescent lamp model that can be determined by genetic algorithms and simple electrical measurements is presented. This model does not require any lamp data from lamp manufacturers. Its parameters can be determined from electrical voltage and current measurements of the lamps under ac operation at mains frequency. With the same set of parameters, the model can predict the lamp terminal characteristics accurately under low, medium and high frequency operations. Good simulation results were achieved when the lamp power was reduced to 60 % of rated power and when the lamp was operated under step-up and step-down transient processes. Simulation results for different sizes of tubular and compact fluorescent lamps agree well with their experimental results. Particularly, the differences between simulation results and experimental results under rated power are less than 10 %. Hence, the proposed model shows a good degree of accuracy: 1) for different types of fluorescent lamps; 2) at different operating frequencies; 3) under different dimming levels; and 4) during step-up and step-down transient processes. © 2007 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{constitutes}} {{the third part}} of a series of work with the goal of developing a three-dimensional computational model to help understand the various physical mechanisms involved in <b>high-pressure</b> <b>discharge</b> arcs. The effect of an externally applied magnetic field on the convection and temperature characteristics is studied in the present effort. The classic experiment of Kenty is first simulated. It is found that the magnetic field can induce a downward velocity to the hot gas core to offset the buoyancy-induced nonuniformity in the temperature field. Separate pairs of contra-rotating recirculating eddies resulting from the magnetic and buoyancy effects can be identified. Qualitative as well as quantitative agreements between Kenty's experiment and the present prediction are observed. The feasibility of applying the magnetic control to optimize the operation of the modern discharge lamp is then investigated. The model reveals that convection strengthens if either the pressure inside the arc-tube or the magnitude of the magnetic field increases. Furthermore, with the same geometry, the required strength of the magnetic field to center the hot core and maintain a symmetric temperature distribution is linearly proportional to the arc-tube pressure. This finding yields a very useful method for optimizing the discharge lamp design. © 1992...|$|E
40|$|The {{optimization}} of the photocatalytic {{activity and}} hydrophilic conversion of TiO 2 {{is an active}} research area {{in the field of}} self-cleaning materials and energy storage/conversion. One major focus is the crystalline phase of TiO 2, known to be the most efficient of the anatase structures. Another issue is the decoration of TiO 2 with noble metals, which act as charge carrier traps for electrons. The latter hinders or reduces the electron-hole recombination rate and often leads to a more efficient photocatalytic activity. In this paper, we describe how an interlayer consisting of 3 - 4 nm silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) promotes TiO 2 anatase crystallisation and has a positive effect on the photoinduced catalytic and hydrophylic properties of TiO 2 thin films. Ag-NPs and TiO 2 were deposited by magnetron sputtering in the same reactor in a two-step process: a) condensation of Ag-NPs produced in the gas phase thanks to a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>discharge,</b> and b) conventional TiO 2 magnetron deposition in oxide mode. Four temperatures from RT to 288 °C were investigated and film thickness was 80 nm. Particle size and film structure were determined by TEM, HRTEM and XRD. Photocatalytic activities of the samples were tracked by the evaluation of the surface hydrophilicity after UV illumination and 24. hours post-illumination, and by UV-induced palmitic acid degradation. © 2011.

40|$|Subject of {{the paper}} is {{investigations}} of non-steady state behavior for <b>high-pressure</b> gas <b>discharge</b> in the air-hydrocarbon mixtures as applied {{to the problem of}} ignition and flame stabilization. The device, used in the experiments (Fig. 1), is based on design of classical arc plasmatron [1, 2]. However, the distinctive feature of the plasmatron operation in our experimental conditions is that an average current is limited by the ballast resistor Rb at a level of about 0. 1 A. Average power dissipated in plasmatron does not exceed 100 W. In spite of extremely low average power, plasmatron demonstrates reliable ignition and flame stabilization for air-propane mixtures {{in a wide range of}} equivalence ratios. A key point in understanding physical mechanism of flame ignition and control is elucidation of non-steady state discharge behavior. An important role in the non-steady state discharge processes belongs to capacitance C of connecting cable. If the current from the power supply were high enough, then the discharge would be able to burn as a steady state thermal arc with distinctively expressed cathode spot. However, in the conditions of low current, the cathode spot is extinguished, and during some time, the discharge is sustained in a low-current glow mode.

40|$|We {{tested a}} variety of high-current closing {{switches}} for lifetime and reliability on a dedicated 2 MJ, 500 kA capacitor bank facility at Sandia National Laboratories. Our interest was a switch capable of one shot every few minutes, switching a critically damped, DC-charged 6. 2 mF bank at 24 kV, with a peak current of 500 kA. The desired lifetime is 24 thousand shots. Typical of high-energy systems, particularly multi-module systems, the primary parameters of interest related to the switch are: (1) reliability, meaning absence of both pre-fires and no-fires, (2) total switch lifetime or number of shots between maintenance, and (3) cost. Cost was given lower priority at this evaluation stage because there are great uncertainties in estimating higher-quantity prices of these devices, most {{of which have been}} supplied before in only small quantities. The categories of switches tested are vacuum discharge, <b>high-pressure</b> <b>discharge,</b> and solid-state. Each group varies in terms of triggering ease, ease of maintenance, and tolerance to faults such as excess current and current reversal. We tested at least two variations of each technology group. The total number of shots on the switch test facility is about 50 thousand. We will present the results from the switch testing. The observed lifetime of different switches varied greatly: the shortest life was one shot; one device was still operating after six thousand shots.

The individual streamer properties depend on the gas properties, the pressure and the gap spacing. For a given industrial application of DBD, the large spacing between the electrodes is favored because of treatment restrictions. The advantage of the current apparatus is treating the large samples close to the room temperature while the common dielectric barrier glow discharges suppress the streamers by reducing the electrode gap distances.|$|R
