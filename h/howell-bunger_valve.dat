40|$|Fixed-Cone valves {{are often}} used to {{dissipate}} energy and regulate flow at the low level outlet works of dams. Fixed-Cone valves, also known as <b>Howell-Bunger</b> <b>valves,</b> create an expanding conical jet allowing {{the energy of the}} water to dissipate over a large area. However, in many applications constructing the large stilling basin necessary for these valves is either not possible or not feasible. In order to reduce the relative size of the stilling basin, hoods or concrete containment structures have been used in conjunction with Fixed-Cone valves. This paper compares two methods of energy dissipation used in conjunction with concrete containment structures. The first method of energy dissipation is the use of baffles, and the second is a deflector ring with end sill. In order to determine which type of energy dissipation method was most effective for this particular application, measurements and observations were taken in order to compare the amount of energy dissipated by the structure and the Fixed-Cone valve, the air demand of the structure, the velocities downstream of the structure, and flow stability downstream of the structure. This information will be useful to engineers allowing them to minimize scour and erosion associated with concrete containment structures...|$|R
40|$|The IAHR Hydraulic Structures Section, {{jointly with}} the Instituto Superior Técnico (IST) and the Portuguese Water Resources Association (APRH), {{organised}} the International Junior Researcher and Engineer Workshop on Hydraulic Structures (IJREWHS 2 ̆ 706). The international workshop addressed conventional and innovative aspects of hydraulic structures design, operation, rehabilitation, and {{interaction with the}} environment. The main themes of the workshop embraced the hydraulics of dams and hydropower schemes, river structures, hydraulic structures in urban drainage and sewer systems, as well as coastal protection systems. A total of 8 countries were represented during the event, namely Australia, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States of America. The topics included : Research Quality, Publications and Impact in Hydraulic Engineering, Dynamic Behaviour of Jets Issued from <b>Howell-Bunger</b> <b>Valves,</b> Experimental Investigation of Air Circulation Patterns in Classical Hydraulic Jumps, Labyrinth Spillways Design Methods and Consideration of Non-Standard Approach Conditions and Geometries, Discharge Capacity and Residual Energy of Labyrinth Weirs, Energy Dissipation in Vertical and Stepped Sewer Drops in a Circular Channel, Hydrodynamic Pressure Field on Steeply Sloping Stepped Spillways, Experimental Investigations on the Stability of Riprap Slope Protection Layers on Overtoppable Earth Dams, Non-Aerated Skimming Flow Properties on Stepped Chutes over Embankment Dams, Determination of Design Parameters for Coastal Dikes on the German North Sea, Contribution to the Design of Artificial Surfing Reef Breakwaters for Coastal Protection, Waves caused by Landslides into Reservoirs and their Impacts on Dams, Advanced Post-Processing and Correlation Analyses in High-Velocity Air-Water Flows, PIV Limitations in Water-Pump Intake Measurements, Technologic Innovation in Data Acquisition Systems applied to Environmental Monitoring, and Photographs of Hydraulic Structures...|$|R
40|$|In many {{hydroelectric}} projects {{there is}} a need to safely dissipate the energy associated with the elevation of the water surface. When the flow is not passing through the turbines, bypass valves are often used. A valve that is commonly used is the fixed-cone valve. Fixed-cone valves, also known as <b>Howell-Bunger</b> <b>valves,</b> are devices often used to safely reduce flow energy at dams with medium to high heads. The valve directs the outflow into a conical hollow jet, which requires a large area for energy dissipation. The flow is controlled by an adjustable sleeve, also known as the gate which surrounds the valve and requires minimal power for operation even for large valves. Depending on the installation, the conical jet may need to be controlled by installing a fixed stationary hood or other structure to contain and direct the conical jet. While the hood reduces the spray, the use of the hood causes the formation of a concentrated hollow jet having a high velocity. To eliminate the hollow jet and dissipate much of the associated energy, the hood can have interior baffles. If the hood is not precisely placed relative to the valve, a phenomenon, known as backsplash, will occur. Backsplash is when a significant amount of water exits the upstream end of the hood. Backsplash is a concern for operators because it can prevent access to the valve during operation and can flood valve vaults. Because the use of fixed-cone valves and baffled-hoods are becoming more popular, the need for guidelines to correctly position the hood relative to the valve will benefit both engineers and contractors. 	 In some hydroelectric sites, submerging the fixed-cone valve is used to control the spray and dissipate energy. Submerging the valve can have can produce violent flow conditions which can cause damage to a structure or heavy erosion. The use of a submerged fixed-cone valve is rarely used, and a submerged valve used with a baffled-hood has never been constructed. The study performed shows that the use of a baffled hood with a fixed-cone valve in submerged conditions performs well. The results may lead the way for more submerged fixed-cone valves in the future...|$|R
