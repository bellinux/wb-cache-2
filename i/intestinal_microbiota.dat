25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the normal}} range of volumes of flatus in normal individuals varies hugely (476–1,491ml/24h). All intestinal gas is either swallowed environmental air, present intrinsically in foods and beverages or the result of gut fermentation. Swallowing small amounts of air occurs while eating and drinking. This is emitted from the mouth by eructation (burping) and is normal. Excessive swallowing of environmental air is called aerophagia, and {{has been shown in}} a few case reports to be responsible for increased flatus volume. This is however considered a rare cause of increased flatus volume. Gases contained in food and beverages is likewise emitted largely through eructation, e.g., carbonated beverages. Endogenously produced intestinal gases make up 74 percent of flatus in normal subjects. The volume of gas produced is partially dependent upon the composition of the <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiota,</b> which is normally very resistant to change, but is also very different in different individuals. Some patients are predisposed to increased endogenous gas production by virtue of their gut microbiota composition. The greatest concentration of gut bacteria is in the colon, while the small intestine is normally near sterile. Fermentation occurs when unabsorbed food residues may arrive in the colon. Therefore, even more than the composition of the microbiota, diet is the primary factor that dictates the volume of flatus produced. Diets that aim {{to reduce the amount of}} undigested fermentable food residues arriving in the colon have been shown to significantly reduce the volume of flatus produced. Again, it is emphasised that increased volume of intestinal gas will not cause bloating and pain in normal subjects. Abnormal intestinal gas dynamics will create pain, distension, and bloating, regardless of whether there is high or low total flatus volume.|$|E

40|$|In humans, nonstarch polysaccharides (NSP), such as {{arabinoxylans}} (AX), are not digested in {{the upper}} gut and provide fermentable carbon sources for bacteria growing in the large bowel. Despite the ubiquity of AX in nature, the microbiologic and physiologic consequences of AX digestion in the gut are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the breakdown of ferulic acid-cross-linked AX (AXF) and non-cross-linked AX in children's <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiotas,</b> using starch as a readily fermentable polysaccharide for comparative purposes. The experiments were performed using pH-controlled fermentation vessels under anaerobic conditions. The results demonstrated that there was variation in the metabolism of these polysaccharides by colonic microbiotas. AX was always degraded more slowly than starch, while ferulic acid cross-linking reduced the rate of AX fermentation, as shown by fermentation product measurements. Starch digestion was associated with significant acetate and butyrate production, whereas AX breakdown resulted in increased propionate formation. In general, the presence of fermentable carbohydrate significantly increased the total anaerobe counts and eubacterial rRNA concentrations (P < 0. 01), while non-cross-linked AX digestion was principally associated with increased viable counts of Bacteroides fragilis group organisms, which was supported by increases in Bacteroides-Porphyromonas-Prevotella group rRNA (P < 0. 01). Starch was considerably more bifidogenic than AX in these fermentations. In conclusion, {{in this study we}} found that the effects of AX and AXF on the microbial ecology and metabolism of <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiotas</b> are similar in children and adults...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) is an {{important}} model for human intestinal research. We have characterized the faecal microbiota of 60 guinea pigs using Illumina shotgun metagenomics, and used this data to compile a gene catalogue of its prevalent microbiota. Subsequently, we compared the guinea pig microbiome to existing human gut metagenome data from the MetaHIT project. Results We found that the bacterial richness obtained for human samples was lower than for guinea pig samples. The <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiotas</b> of both species were dominated by the two phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, but at genus level, the majority of identified genera (320 of 376) were differently abundant in the two hosts. For example, the guinea pig contained considerably more of the mucin-degrading Akkermansia, {{as well as of}} the methanogenic archaea Methanobrevibacter than found in humans. Most microbiome functional categories were less abundant in guinea pigs than in humans. Exceptions included functional categories possibly reflecting dehydration/rehydration stress in the guinea pig intestine. Finally, we showed that microbiological databases have serious anthropocentric biases, which impacts model organism research. Conclusions The results lay the foundation for future gastrointestinal research applying guinea pigs as models for humans. </p...|$|R

A life-long gluten free diet (GFD) is the only therapeutic approach. Dysbiosis, which can precede the CD pathogenesis and/or persist when subjects are on GFD, is reviewed and discussed. Salivary microbiota and metabolome differed between healthy and celiac children treated under GFD (T-CD) {{for at least two}} years. The type of GFD (African- vs Italian-style) modified the microbiota and metabolome of Saharawi T-CD children. Different studies showed bacterial dysbiosis at duodenal and/or fecal level of patients with active untreated CD (U-CD) and T-CD compared to healthy subjects. The ratio of protective anti-inflammatory bacteria such as. Lactobacillus-Bifidobacterium to potentially harmful. Bacteroides-Enterobacteriaceae was the lowest in U-CD and T-CD children. In agreement with dysbiosis, serum, fecal and urinary metabolome from U-CD and T-CD patients showed altered levels of free amino acids and volatile organic compounds.

The pathogen was administered on day 11 of the experiment, at an oral dose of 10 (9) CFU. calf- 1.

The respiratory burst of neutrophils that transmigrate into the intestinal lumen during inflammation oxidizes endogenous sulfur compounds to generate a respiratory electron acceptor, tetrathionate. As a result, Salmonella can use tetrathionate respiration to outgrow the fermenting microbiota in the anaerobic environment of the gut, which promotes transmission of the pathogen.
