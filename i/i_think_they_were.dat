500|$|The {{writers were}} new to screenwriting, so their film {{treatment}} ran to 110-pages; the average was 15 pages. Reitman and Simmons pitched it to various Hollywood studios. Simmons met with Ned Tanen, {{an executive at}} Universal Studios. He was encouraged by younger executives Sean Daniel and Thom Mount who were more receptive to the Lampoon type of humor; Mount had discovered the [...] "Seven Fires" [...] film treatment as Tanen's assistant, while investigating projects left by a fired studio executive. Tanen hated the idea. Ramis remembers, [...] "We went further than I think Universal expected or wanted. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> shocked and appalled. Chris' fraternity had virtually been a vomiting cult. And {{we had a lot}} of scenes that were almost orgies of vomit... We didn't back off anything". As the writers created more drafts of the screenplay (nine in total), the studio gradually became more receptive to the project, especially Mount, who championed it. The studio green-lighted the film and set the budget at a modest $3 million. Simmons remembers, [...] "They just figured, 'Screw it, it's a silly little movie, and we’ll make a couple of bucks if we're lucky—let them do whatever they want.' ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{overview}} of the third season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Apocrypha" [...] was rated an A. The review noted that the episode offered [...] "some interesting progressions in the grand theme" [...] of the series, although it was also [...] "worth it just for the awesome missile site finale" [...] alone. Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen also rated the episode an A. Handlen felt the episode was impressive in its general impression, but that the details were not necessarily important; he also added that the cyclical nature of the plot of most mythology episodes was not something he felt negatively about, noting that although the series' protagonists are often defeated, they [...] "can't be corrupted or dissuaded or undone". Co-writer Frank Spotnitz said of the episode [...] "I actually think you didn't learn a lot more about the conspiracy in these two episodes, but emotionally, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> really good episodes ... It is really easy to go through a lot of these action things with people dying and never addressing them. So I thought it was very interesting to do so".|$|E
500|$|On August 22, 2015, Beholder {{became the}} first filly or mare to win the Grade I Pacific Classic against males. She won by [...] lengths with a final time of 1:59.77, against an {{otherwise}} all-male field of nine other horses, including 2014 Breeders' Cup Classic winner Bayern. She won in the third-fastest winning {{time in the history}} of the race, and with the second-largest margin of victory, behind the 2013 win of Game On Dude. Hughes said: [...] "She’s the first horse who has made me feel lucky to be her owner." [...] Mandella quipped, [...] "We didn’t think she would do it quite like that. We thought it was the girls she was picking on." [...] and added later, [...] "I think the boys pissed her off. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> telling sexist jokes on the backside." [...] After the race, her [...] connections announced that she would train with the goal of running in the Breeders' Cup Classic. [...] They also suggested that she might race again in 2016 and that upon retirement, Hughes would be likely to keep her at his Spendthrift Farm and not offer her for sale.|$|E

2500|$|Even {{though the}} group's name {{includes}} Finland's capital Helsinki, they first played {{there at the}} Flow Festival in August 2007: [...] "When we were in Norway {{at the end of}} last year there were a few Finnish interviewers who came to interview us mainly about the name. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> quite perplexed. To us, the name means having to answer many questions and inquiries about the name, which I guess, is entirely understandable." [...] Sam Perry said.|$|E
2500|$|At a 27 July 1960 Republican National Committee {{breakfast in}} Chicago, President Dwight D. Eisenhower said, {{probably}} referring to Sweden, [...] "Only {{in the last}} few weeks, I have been reading quite an article on the experiment of almost complete paternalism in a friendly European country. This country has a tremendous record for socialistic operation, following a socialistic philosophy, and the record shows that their rate of suicide has gone up almost unbelievably and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> almost the lowest nation in the world for that. Now, they have more than twice our rate. Drunkenness has gone up. Lack of ambition is discernible on all sides." ...|$|E
2500|$|John O'Hara, in his 1960 novel Ourselves to Know, uses St. Anthony Hall {{membership}} in the characterizations of the protagonists: [...] "Did you join a fraternity at Penn?" [...] I said. [...] "Yes I did. [...] St Anthony-Delta Psi. [...] But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> sorry that they invited me..." [...] --- [...] "I happened to know, because I had seen it, {{that he had a}} Delta Psi Tea Company gold charm on his watch chain, but the reason he did not show it was one of delicacy; in 1908 they had not accepted his resignation but he kept the insigne hidden..." [...] --- [...] "He and Robert quickly looked at each other's watch-chain and the Delta Psi charm and smiled. [...] "You know, I've been meaning to write you a letter..." [...] ("Tea" [...] Company was a then-used appellation referring to the fraternity's Tau Cross emblem.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Howard {{was born}} as Moses Harry Horwitz on June 19, 1897, in the Brooklyn, New York City {{neighborhood}} of Bensonhurst to Solomon Horwitz and Jennie Gorovitz, the fourth-born of five brothers of Lithuanian Jewish ancestry. He was named Moe {{when he was}} younger and later called himself Harry. Howard's parents and brothers, Benjamin and Irving were not involved in show business, but he, his older brother Shemp Howard, and younger brother Curly Howard all eventually became known as members of The Three Stooges. He loved to read as older brother Jack recalled: [...] "I had many Horatio Alger books, and it was Moe's greatest pleasure to read them. They started his imaginative mind working and gave him ideas by the dozen. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> instrumental in putting thoughts into his head to become a person of good character and to become successful." [...] This helped him in his acting career in later years, such as in memorizing his lines quickly and easily.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002 the {{character}} {{was featured in}} a spoof of the Michael Jackson hit video, Thriller, which was made {{as part of the}} annual fund-raising event, Children in Need. Shaun Williamson as Barry played the Michael Jackson role, while Lucy Speed as Natalie took on Ola Ray’s role as his date. Unlike the original video – where Jackson was seen to turn into a zombie – the spoof saw Natalie transformed into the walking dead. A dozen cast-members took part in the spoof where they recreated the dance routine made famous in the original video. [...] Speed has commented “I really enjoyed that. We were there on our day off but it was brilliant fun. I used to be a dancer {{and to be able to}} do some moves on the Square was good. We all wanted to look as horrific and disgusting as possible. Shaun split his trousers while doing it as well. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> really tight though.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Mistress Grant," [...] said I, [...] "I believe I am already your debtor {{for some}} merry words--and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> kind too--on {{a piece of}} {{unsigned}} paper." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Good gracious, boys, here's Mumty. Shut {{your eyes}} this moment. It's all right, dear. I {{spoke to them}} very {{severely}} and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> nearly asleep." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{replied the}} Eskimo earnestly; [...] "I don't. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> clever scoundrels--clever fools. And more, I don't believe in torngaks {{or any other}} spirits." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then {{they both}} lay still, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> nearly dead {{when they were}} put on the te-train. Their heads moved thus. And there is much blood on the line. Come and see?' ...|$|E
60|$|These {{directions}} I {{translated to}} Anscombe, who went gladly enough with Heda, for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> both {{afraid of the}} terrible old dwarf and did not desire his company in the gathering gloom.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I declare,' said my mother, gently, 'they {{are exactly}} alike. I suppose <b>they</b> <b>are</b> mine. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> the colour of mine. But <b>they</b> <b>are</b> wonderfully alike.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{one of the}} brigands. The ball {{went through}} the brim of my sombrero. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> talking to each other, <b>they</b> know there <b>is</b> no hurry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} the other; [...] "there are two bright things. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> two bits of steel. One {{of the pieces}} of steel is bent or crooked." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I 'd rather work up with you, than sit idle {{while you}} toil away all alone. That 's the way {{father and mother}} did, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> very happy {{in spite of the}} poverty and hard work." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sewell smiled. [...] "From {{one point}} of view <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> wise. It's not the {{contented}} that one usually finds mining in the wilderness. The soil, of course, is British, but that, after all, does not imply very much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No; {{she has no}} {{children}} of her own. There were some Miss Downes; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> Mr. Downe's daughters by a former wife; but they are married and living {{in other parts of}} the town. Mrs. Downe lives alone.' ...|$|E
