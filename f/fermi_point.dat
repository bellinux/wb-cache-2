40|$|We {{study the}} {{electronic}} instabilities in a 2 D Hubbard model {{where one of}} the dimensions has a finite width, {{so that it can be}} considered as a large array of coupled chains. The finite transverse size of the system gives rise to a discrete string of <b>Fermi</b> <b>points,</b> with respective electron fields that, due to their mutual interaction, acquire anomalous scaling dimensions depending on the point of the string. Using bosonization methods, we show that the anomalous scaling dimensions vanish when the number of coupled chains goes to infinity, implying the Fermi liquid behavior of a 2 D system in that limit. However, when the Fermi level is at the Van Hove singularity arising from the saddle points of the 2 D dispersion, backscattering and Cooper-pair scattering lead to the breakdown of the metallic behavior at low energies. These interactions are taken into account through their renormalization group scaling, studying in turn their influence on the nonperturbative bosonization of the model. We show that, at a certain low-energy scale, the anomalous electron dimension diverges at the <b>Fermi</b> <b>points</b> closer to the saddle points of the 2 D dispersion. The d-wave superconducting correlations become also large at low energies, but their growth is cut off as the suppression of fermion excitations takes place first, extending progressively along the <b>Fermi</b> <b>points</b> towards the diagonals of the 2 D Brillouin zone. We stress that this effect arises from the vanishing of the charge stiffness at the <b>Fermi</b> <b>points,</b> characterizing a critical behavior that is well captured within our nonperturbative approach.

We studied the physical structure and band structure of different types of graphene nanoscrolls. The energy dispersion relation of graphene nanoscrolls is determined using the tight-binding (TB) model. The electronic structures of nanoscrolls are significantly dependent on the chirality number (n,m). Armchair nanoscrolls are metallic or semi-metallic depending on their spiral length, and metallic nanoscrolls have a large energy gap at the Fermi level.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} framework based on Huckel tight-binding {{model has been}} formulated to analyze the electronic structure of carbon nanotubes under uniform deformation. The model successfully quantifies the dispersion relation, density of states and bandgap change of nanotubes under uniform stretching, compression, torsion and bending. Our analysis shows that the shifting of the <b>Fermi</b> <b>point</b> away from the Brillouin zone vertices is the key reason for these changes. As {{a result of this}} shifting, the electronic structure of deformed carbon nanotubes varies dramatically depending on their chirality and deformation mode. Treating the <b>Fermi</b> <b>point</b> as a function of strain and tube chirality, the analytical solution preserves the concise form of undeformed carbon nanotubes.

Extension to more complex systems are being performed to relate this analytical solution to the spectroscopic characterization, device performance and proposed quantum structures induced by the deformation.
