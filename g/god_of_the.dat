Unlike <b>the</b> Prey <b>Gods</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hunt these fetishes were never deposited with a keeper, but like <b>the</b> Prey <b>Gods</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hunt they were fed on <b>the</b> blood <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slain and their ceremony involved depositing sacred flour to the four directions and reciting a prayer, and like <b>the</b> Prey <b>Gods</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Six Regions they were protective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carrier (Cushing, 1994:40-43).|$|R

5|$|Little {{is known}} about Kanhopatra. According to most {{traditional}} accounts, Kanhopatra was a courtesan and dancing-girl. These accounts typically concentrate on her death when she chose to surrender to the Hindu god Vithoba—the patron <b>god</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Varkaris—rather than becoming a concubine of the Badshah (king) of Bidar. She died in the central shrine of Vithoba in Pandharpur. She {{is the only person}} whose samadhi (mausoleum) is within the precincts of the temple.|$|E

5|$|Some dances that abound at Carnival and Corpus Christi fiestas {{go back to}} pre-Conquest ritual combat dances of the Aztecs.

5|$|Some of {{the oldest}} and most common {{objections}} to evolution dispute whether evolution can truly account for all the apparent complexity and order in the natural world. It is argued that evolution is too unlikely or otherwise lacking to account for various aspects of life, and therefore that an intelligence, such as <b>God</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Abrahamic religions, must at the very least be appealed to for those specific features.|$|E

5|$|Struve {{came out}} in favour of the name Neptune on 29 December 1846, to the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Soon, Neptune became the internationally {{accepted}} name. In Roman mythology, Neptune was the <b>god</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea, identified with the Greek Poseidon. The demand for a mythological name {{seemed to be in}} keeping with the nomenclature of the other planets, all of which, except for Earth, were named for deities in Greek and Roman mythology.|$|E
5|$|The Odin {{class was}} a pair of coastal defense ships built for the German Kaiserliche Marine in the late 19th century.

The ships were very similar to the preceding s, and are sometimes considered to be one class of ships.|$|E
5|$|The name Pluto, {{after the}} <b>god</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underworld, was {{proposed}} by Venetia Burney (1918–2009), an eleven-year-old schoolgirl in Oxford, England, who {{was interested in}} classical mythology. She suggested it {{in a conversation with}} her grandfather Falconer Madan, a former librarian at the University of Oxford's Bodleian Library, who passed the name to astronomy professor Herbert Hall Turner, who cabled it to colleagues in the United States.|$|E

5|$|The {{protagonist of}} the game is Kratos (voiced by Terrence C. Carson), a Spartan warrior who serves the Olympian Gods. Other {{characters}} include a host of Greek gods, such as Athena (Carole Ruggier), the Goddess of Wisdom and Kratos' ally and mentor; Ares (Steven Blum), the God of War and main antagonist; Poseidon (Fred Tatasciore), the <b>God</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea; Aphrodite (Carole Ruggier), the Goddess of Love and Sexuality; Zeus (Paul Eiding), the King of the Gods; Artemis (Claudia Black), the Goddess of the Hunt; and Hades (Nolan North), the <b>God</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Underworld. Several of the gods aid Kratos with magic or weapons. Minor characters include the Oracle of Athens (Susan Blakeslee), the gravedigger (Paul Eiding), the body burner (Christopher Corey Smith), and the boat captain (Keith Ferguson). Other characters appear in flashbacks, including Kratos' wife Lysandra (Gwendoline Yeo), his daughter Calliope, the Barbarian King, and a Village Oracle (Susan Blakeslee). The game is narrated by Linda Hunt.|$|E
5|$|Tonatiuh, the Aztec <b>god</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sun, {{was usually}} {{depicted}} holding arrows and a shield and was {{closely associated with}} the practice of human sacrifice.

5|$|Although {{the first}} two Uranian moons were {{discovered}} in 1787, they were not named until 1852, a year after two more moons had been discovered. The responsibility for naming was taken by John Herschel, son of the discoverer of Uranus. Herschel, instead of assigning names from Greek mythology, named the moons after magical spirits in English literature: the fairies Oberon and Titania from William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, and the sylphs Ariel and Umbriel from Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock (Ariel is also a sprite in Shakespeare's The Tempest). The reasoning was presumably that Uranus, as <b>god</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky and air, would be attended by spirits of the air.|$|E
