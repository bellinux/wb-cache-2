5|$|Chess {{players and}} theoreticians have long debated whether, given perfect play by both sides, the game should <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> win for White, or a draw. Since {{approximately}} 1889, when World Champion Wilhelm Steinitz addressed this issue, the overwhelming consensus {{has been that}} a perfectly played game would <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> draw. However, a few notable players have argued that White's advantage may be sufficient to force a win: Weaver Adams and Vsevolod Rauzer claimed that White is winning after the first move 1.e4, while Hans Berliner argued that 1.d4 may win for White.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{small number}} of stages were {{expected}} to <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sprint, barring a successful breakaway. Sprinters in the event included Mark Cavendish, Alessandro Petacchi, Allan Davis, Filippo Pozzato, Robert Hunter, Robert Förster, Tyler Farrar, Juan José Haedo, and Oscar Gatto.|$|E
5|$|The premaxillary bones {{each house}} a single incisor, {{which is located}} at the front tip. They <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> V shape at the front margin and in a narrow point at the back margin. Inside each premaxilla is a large opening, the {{anterior}} palatal foramen. The maxillary bone contains the other upper teeth. The mandible ranges from thin to robust and houses the lower teeth.|$|E
50|$|Slovio verbs {{can have}} various endings. To create the infinitive and present, add -vit if the root <b>ends</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> o, -it if it <b>ends</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> consonant, and -t and {{optionally}} -vit if it <b>ends</b> <b>in</b> <b>a,</b> e, i, or u.|$|R
5000|$|French has {{an example}} of morphologically {{conditioned}} alternation. The feminine form of many adjectives <b>ends</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> consonant sound that is missing in the masculine form. In spelling, the feminine <b>ends</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> silent e, while the masculine <b>ends</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> silent consonant letter: ...|$|R
5000|$|Old Thai had a {{three-way}} tone distinction on live syllables (those not <b>ending</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> stop), with no possible distinction on dead syllables (those <b>ending</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> stop, i.e. either [...] or the glottal stop which automatically closes syllables otherwise <b>ending</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> short vowel).|$|R
5|$|Both leagues {{employ the}} same two-series playoff format, {{with the top}} three teams from each league {{participating}} in their own two-stage playoff. If two teams vying for a third Climax Series spot finish the regular season with identical records, the team that finished the previous season with a better record is allowed {{to advance to the}} playoffs, unless if both teams finished with the same previous season record. The First Stage is a best-of-three series involving the regular season's second- and third-place finishers, with all games played at the second-place team's home field. The winner of this series goes on to face the league's pennant-winner in the Final Stage. This series is best-of-six. The league champion is awarded a one-win advantage as well as home field advantage for the entire series, unlike most professional leagues where a 5-game playoff series runs 2-2-1 or 2-3 or a 7-game playoff series that runs 2-3-2 with the higher seed receiving the extra game. The winning teams advance to the Japan Series, where they compete against one another. Unlike MLB, NPB games may <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tie if there is no winner after 12innings of play. If a Climax Series game results in a tie, the win is credited to neither team. If this causes the series to <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tie, the team who finished higher in the regular-season standings advances, unless if both teams finished with the same regular-season record. If both teams finished with the same regular season record, the team who won the most matches against the other team will advance.|$|E
5|$|Both teams' {{responses}} to Liverpool's third goal {{were to make}} substitutions in the final quarter of the game. Liverpool defender Rob Jones was swapped for striker Ian Rush and Newcastle's Darren Peacock was changed for Steve Howey in order to tighten up the Newcastle defence. As the match looked likely to <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> draw, in stoppage time Rush and John Barnes began to play a series of one-twos towards the Newcastle end. Barnes passed the ball to Collymore in a space on the left flank; Collymore kicked it past Srníček to score his second goal of the game, which prompted jubilant scenes in the Liverpool Kop. In contrast, Keegan slumped over the advertising hoardings in distress.|$|E
5|$|Celtic faced Yugoslavia (now Serbian) side Vojvodina Novi Sad in the quarter-finals, {{and lost}} {{the first leg}} 1–0 after a goal from Milan Stanić; this was Celtic's only defeat of the competition. The tie {{looked like it was}} going to <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> draw after Chalmers had given Celtic a 1–0 lead in the second leg. This would have {{resulted}} in the teams from having to go to Rotterdam for a replay. However, in the 90th minute captain Billy McNeill scored to give Celtic the victory. In the semi-finals, Czechoslovakian side Dukla Prague were beaten 3–1 in Glasgow, Johnstone put the hosts in front, before Stanislav Štrunc equalised. A second half brace from Willie Wallace gave Celtic the victory. The teams then drew 0–0 in Prague, which meant Celtic progressed to the final.|$|E

5|$|Chess is a two-player {{board game}} {{utilizing}} a chessboard and sixteen pieces of six types for each player. Each type of piece moves in a distinct way. The {{goal of the}} game is to checkmate (threaten with unescapable capture) the opponent's king. Games do not necessarily end with checkmate; players often resign if they believe they will lose. A game can also <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> draw in several ways.|$|E
5|$|Ernst Lindemann was {{frustrated}} by the fact that—as commander of the Naval Gunnery School—he would never come into {{direct contact with the}} enemy. When he received the news that he had been selected to be the first commander of the battleship , he was honoured by the trust that had been bestowed on him but doubted that {{he would be able to}} get Bismarck ready for action before the war was over. His doubts suggest that he was confident the war would <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> favourable outcome for Germany by mid-1940. Prior to commanding Bismarck, Lindemann had never held any shipboard command, a situation rare if not unique in the Kriegsmarine. Nevertheless, Lindemann had served exclusively on ships with a gun calibre of at least , and he was Germany's leading gunnery expert. In 1940, he ranked second out of Crew 1913 and was considered an outstanding leader.|$|E
5|$|In United States v. Price (1965), {{eighteen}} Ku Klux Klan {{members were}} charged with murder and conspiracy {{for the deaths of}} James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, but the charges were dismissed by the trial court. A unanimous Supreme Court, which included Black, reversed the dismissal and ordered the case to proceed to trial. Seven of these men, including fellow Klansmen Samuel Bowers, Cecil Price and Alton Wayne Roberts were found guilty of the crime; eight of them, including Lawrence A.

5|$|In week nine, the All-Americans {{played the}} Bulldogs. Jim Thorpe, who was later {{inducted}} into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, started the game for the Bulldogs, but he came out at halftime because he believed it would <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tie. Both teams were slowed by a muddy field, and the football became soggy after three quarters. Neither the All-Americans nor the Bulldogs could gain a lot of yards during the game. The lone score of the game came with under four minutes to play: a field goal from the Bulldogs' Al Feeney. He never missed a field goal the entire 1920 season, and the final score of the game was 3–0.|$|E

5|$|Leccinum manzanitae {{mushroom}} {{produce a}} cinnamon-brown spore print. Spores are 13–17 by 4–5.5µm, somewhat elliptical to cylindrical, and tapered on each end (fusoid); their walls are smooth and moderately thick. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are 27–32 by 6–9µm, club-shaped to pear-shaped (pyriform) and four-spored. The cystidia are 23–32 by 4–6µm, fusoid to club-shaped with narrow, elongated apices. Caulocystidia (found on the stipe surface) are thin-walled, club-shaped to somewhat fusoid, and sometimes <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sharp point; they measure 35–45 by 9–14µm. Clamp connections are absent in the hyphae of Leccinum manzanitae.

5|$|Miniopterus mahafaliensis is a small, short-tailed Miniopterus {{with long}} and dense fur. The fur of the upperparts is brown and {{the hairs on}} the underparts have gray tips. Miniopterus brachytragos is similar in color, but other small Malagasy Miniopterus are darker. The ears are {{partially}} haired above, but virtually naked below and <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rounded tip. The tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is relatively thick, has the sides mostly parallel, and ends in a curved, rounded tip. The wing membrane is also brown, but the uropatagium (tail membrane) is lighter. The wing membrane and uropatagium are attached to the upper leg at the same level, above the ankle. The uropatagium is relatively densely covered with hairs, particularly on the upper side. M.manavi and M.brachytragos also have a densely haired uropatagium, but in M.aelleni and M.griveaudi it is only sparsely haired or even mostly naked.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus manavi is a {{diminutive}} species with fur of medium length. The upperparts are blackish or reddish brown. Other small Malagasy Miniopterus are lighter.

The tragus (a projection {{on the inner}} side of the outer ear) is thin for most of its length, ends in an angular tip, and has a flange at the medial side (towards the midline of the animal). The tragus is differently shaped in other species. The wings and uropatagium (tail membrane) are blackish and are attached to the upper leg at the same level, above the ankle. The uropatagium is densely haired above and more sparsely below, as in M.mahafaliensis and M.brachytragos; M.griveaudi and M.aelleni have more nearly naked uropatagia.|$|E
5|$|Nolan captained Newcastle for {{the first}} time in a 5–1 win against Cardiff City taking over for the absent Nicky Butt and Alan Smith. After an 11-game goal drought, Nolan picked up his 11th league goal of the season on 20 February against Preston North <b>End</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 3–0 win. He {{followed}} this up with the final goal in Newcastle's 6–1 home drubbing of Barnsley two games later. He was voted as the Championship Player of the Year at the Football League Awards on 16 March. On 5 April 2010, Newcastle United secured automatic promotion to the Premier League, after fellow contenders Nottingham Forest failed to beat Cardiff City. Newcastle took to the field hours later, in front of 48,750 fans, and Nolan scored the winner with a scissor-kick in the 2–1 win over Sheffield United.|$|E
