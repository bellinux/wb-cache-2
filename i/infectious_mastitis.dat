40|$|Introduction: While {{the role}} of many cytokines during {{infection}} is known, the implication of recently discovered cytokines is not well defined. The involvement of recently describedinterleukin- 32 in <b>infectious</b> <b>mastitis,</b> caused by two prevalent mastitis pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, has not been investigated so far and we present initialresults. Material and Methods: Two bovine mammary gland epithelial cells lines (BME-UV and PS) were infected with bovine <b>infectious</b> <b>mastitis</b> organisms E. coli or S. aureus. Using RT- qPCRthe kinetics of IL- 32, IL- 6 and IL- 8 gene expression was determined. Results: E. coli induces a weak IL- 6 expression in BME-UV and a strong IL- 6 expression in PS cells, while a faint IL- 6 expression was observed during S. aureus infection in both celllines. IL- 8 expression was detected during the exposure to both pathogens with the strongest signal in E. coli-infected PS cells. Regarding IL- 32 expression, different responses wereobserved in cells exposed to E. coli and S. aureus strains: while IL- 32 expression was increased in both cell lines infected with E. coli, there was a decrease of IL- 32 expression in cellsexposed to S. aureus strains. Conclusion: Taking into account that endogenous IL- 32 controls the production of IL- 6, IFN-γ and TNF-α during some infection, the decrease of IL- 32 expression in cells exposed to S. aureus, could be partially responsible for the weak immune response during staphylococcal infection, which may be favorable {{for the development of}} chronic mastitis...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Although Staphylococcus aureus is {{considered}} the main etiological agent of <b>infectious</b> <b>mastitis,</b> recent {{studies have suggested that}} coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) may also {{play an important role in}} such infections. The aims of this work were to isolate staphylococci from milk of women with lactational mastitis, to select and characterize the CNS isolates, and to compare such properties with those displayed by CNS strains isolated from milk of healthy women. Results The milk of 30 women was collected and bacterial growth was noted in 27 of them, of which Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated from 26 patients and S. aureus from 8. Among the 270 staphylococcal isolates recovered from milk of women with mastitis, 200 were identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis by phenotypic assays, species-specific PCR and PCR sequencing. They were typified by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) genotyping. The PFGE profiles of the S. epidermidis strains were compared with those of 105 isolates from milk of healthy women. A representative of the 76 different PFGE profiles was selected to study the incidence of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance. The number of strains that contained the biofilm-related ica D gene and that showed resistance to oxacillin, erythromycin, clindamycin and mupirocin was significantly higher among the strains isolated from mastitic milk. Conclusion S. epidermidis may be a frequent but largely underrated cause of <b>infectious</b> <b>mastitis</b> in lactating women. The resistance to diverse antibiotics and a higher ability to form biofilms found among the strains isolated from milk of women suffering mastitis may explain the chronic and/or recurrent nature of this infectious condition. </p...|$|E

In this research, 135 ewes with mastitis from 31 sheep flocks distributed in 15 districts were examined. Staph. aureus was isolated from sheep milk in 9 (29 %) out of 31 herds located in 47 % of the districts surveyed. MLST analysis allowed the identification of four STs (ST 750, ST 1728, ST 1729 and ST 1730).

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Infectious</b> <b>mastitis</b> is {{a common}} {{condition}} during lactation and in fact, {{represents one of the}} main causes leading to a precocious weaning. The number of studies dealing with lactational mastitis is low and, up to now, the etiological diagnosis is frequently {{made on the basis of}} unspecific clinical signs. The aim of this study was to investigate the microbial diversity of breast milk in 20 women with lactational mastitis employing culture-dependent and culture-independent (PCR-DGGE) approaches. Methods Breast milk samples were cultured in different media to investigate the presence of bacteria and/or yeasts, and a total of 149 representative isolates were identified to the species level by 16 S rRNA gene PCR sequencing. The microorganisms recovered were compared with those found by PCR-DGGE analysis. To identify the DGGE profiles two reference markers of different microbial species were constructed. Sequence analysis of unknown bands was also performed. Results Staphylococci were the dominant bacterial group and Staphylococcus epidermidis was the dominant species. In a lower number of samples, other bacteria (mainly streptococci and a few gram-negative species) were also identified. Globally, PCR-DGGE results showed a good correlation with those obtained by culture-based methods. However, although DNA bands corresponding to different lactic acid bacteria were detected, such bacteria could not be isolated from the milk samples. Conclusion Staphylococci seem to be the main etiological agents of human lactational mastitis. The combined use of culture and molecular techniques allowed a better characterization of the bacterial diversity in milk from women suffering from <b>infectious</b> <b>mastitis.</b> Our results suggest that this condition could be the result of a disbiotic process where some of the bacterial species usually present in human milk outgrow (staphylococci) while others disappear (lactobacilli or lactococci). </p...|$|E

40|$|Mastitis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{economically}} significant diseases for the dairy industry for backyard farmers in developing countries and high producing herds worldwide. Two of the major factors impeding reduction in the incidence of this disease is [a] the lack of availability of an effective vaccine capable of protecting against multiple etiological agents and [b] propensity of some of the etiological agents to develop persistent antibiotic resistance in biofilms. This is further complicated by the continuing revolving shift in the predominant etiological agents of mastitis, depending upon a multitude of factors such as variability in hygienic practices on farms, easy access leading to overuse of appropriate or inappropriate antibiotics at suboptimal concentrations, particularly in developing countries, and lack of compliance with the recommended treatment schedules. Regardless, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus uberis followed by Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae has become the predominant etiological agents of bovine mastitis followed Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysagalactiae, Klebsiella pneumonia and the newly emerging Mycoplasma bovis. Current approaches being pursued to reduce the negative economic impact of this disease are through early diagnosis of infection, immediate treatment with an antibiotic found to either inhibit or kill the pathogen(s) in vitro using planktonic cultures and the use of the currently marketed vaccines regardless of their demonstrated effectiveness. Given the limitations of breeding programs, including genetic selection to improve resistance against <b>infectious</b> diseases including <b>mastitis,</b> it is imperative to have the availability of an effective broad-spectrum, preferably cross-protective, vaccine capable of protecting against bovine mastitis for reduction in the incidence of bovine mastitis, as well as interrupting the potential cross-species transmission to humans.

40|$|Dairy {{cows are}} highly {{susceptible}} to <b>infectious</b> diseases, like <b>mastitis,</b> {{during the period}} around calving. Although factors contributing to increased susceptibility to infection have not been fully elucidated, impaired neutrophil recruitment {{to the site of}} infection and changes in the concentrations of some micronutrients related with the function of the immune defence has been implicated. Most of the current information is based on studies outside the Nordic countries where the conditions for dairy cows are different. Therefore, the aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate changes in blood concentrations of the vitamins A and E, the minerals calcium (Ca), phosphorous (P), and magnesium (Mg), the electrolytes potassium (K) and sodium (Na) and the trace elements selenium (Se), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn), as well as changes in total and differential white blood cell counts (WBC) and expression of the adhesion molecules CD 62 L and CD 18 on blood neutrophils in Swedish dairy cows during the period around calving. Blood samples were taken from 10 cows one month before expected calving, at calving and one month after calving. The results were mainly in line with reports from other countries. The concentrations of vitamins A and E, and of Zn, Ca and P decreased significantly at calving, while Se, Cu, and Na increased. Leukocytosis was detected at calving, mainly explained by neutrophilia, but also by monocytosis. The numbers of lymphocytes tended to decrease at the same time. The mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of CD 62 L and CD 18 molecules on blood neutrophils remained constant over time. The proportion of CD 62 L + neutrophils decreased significantly at calving. The animals were fed according to, or above, their requirements. Therefore, changes in blood levels of vitamins, minerals and trace elements were mainly in response to colostrum formation, changes in dry matter intake, and ruminal metabolism around calving. Decreased levels of vitamins A and E, and of Zn at calving might have negative implications for the functions of the immune defence. The lower proportion of CD 62 L+ neutrophils at calving may result in less migration of blood neutrophils into the tissues, and might contribute to the increased susceptibility to infections at this time. </p...|$|R

In addition, we investigated the effect of elevated plasma BHBA and intramammary lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge on the mammary immune response. Thirteen dairy cows were infused either with BHBA (HyperB, n= 5) to induce hyperketonemia (1. 7 mmol/L) or with a 0. 9 % saline solution (NaCl, n= 8) for 56 h. Two udder quarters were injected with 200 μg of LPS after 48 h of infusion. Rectal temperature (RT) and somatic cell counts (SCC) were measured before, at 48 h after the start of infusions, and hourly during the LPS challenge. The mRNA abundance of factors related to the immune system was measured in hepatic and mammary tissue biopsies 1 wk before and 48 h after the start of the infusion, and additionally in mammary tissue at 56 h of infusion (8 h after LPS administration). At 48 h of infusion in HyperB, the mRNA abundance of serum amyloid A (SAA) in the mammary gland was increased and that of haptoglobin (Hp) tended to be increased. Rectal temperature, SCC, and mRNA abundance of candidate genes in the liver were not affected by the BHBA infusion until 48 h. During the following LPS challenge, RT and SCC increased in both groups. However, SCC increased less in HyperB than in NaCl. Quarters infused with LPS showed a more pronounced increase of mRNA abundance of IL- 8 and IL- 10 in HyperB than in NaCl. The results demonstrate that an increase of plasma BHBA upregulates acute phase proteins in the mammary gland. In response to intramammary LPS challenge, elevated BHBA diminishes the influx of leukocytes from blood into milk, perhaps by via modified cytokine synthesis. Results indicate that increased ketone body plasma concentrations may play a crucial role in the higher mastitis susceptibility in early lactation...|$|R
40|$|Bovine {{mastitis}} is an {{inflammation of}} the mammary gland and most often results from bacterial infection. Major etiologic agents of mastitis include Staphylocccus aureus, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus uberis. These intramammary infections cause huge economic losses in the dairy farming sector and dairy industry. As of yet, prevention of bovine mastitis is mostly based on vaccination, which proved elusive in field conditions, and by thorough hygienic procedures during milking, such as the application of systemic or local therapies (pre- and post-milking teat dipping). Despite these measures, mastitis is not fully under control. The treatment of bovine mastitis is predominantly based on antibiotics. However, they are not totally effective and this massive use contributes {{to the risk of}} antibiotic resistance dissemination, which, via animal-to-human transmission, can further impact both animal and human health. Milk production (as well as the entire farming activities) has to cope with an increasing societal demand for a more sustainable agriculture respectful of the environment (e. g. by reducing inputs and improving animal welfare). This demand prompts the need for alternative strategies that can be used as prophylactic or alternative or complementary curative treatments. One alternative is the emerging concept of mammary probiotics. For this purpose, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are good candidates due to their Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) status and their recognized technological and inhibitory properties. LAB have been investigated for many years for their beneficial effects on human health. Introducing selected bacterial strains such as LAB has been demonstrated to be efficient in human health to restore the microbiota homeostasis and has {{led to the development of}} vaginal and intestinal probiotics. Similarly, the barrier effect of LAB isolated from bovine mammary gland or from exogenous ecosystems against mastitis pathogens is being explored. LAB are able to interfere with the <b>infectious</b> cycle of <b>mastitis</b> pathogen by several means, including a direct inhibition of the pathogen growth, titration of the pathogen by co-aggregation, competition with pathogens for tissue colonization or modulation of the innate immune system. These mechanisms will be reviewed and illustrated by our own results as well as other studies. Among steps of the infectious cycle, tissue colonization deserves special attention. It is suspected to be used by some pathogens such as S. aureus to evade host defenses and persist in the mammary gland. We have notably shown that Lactobacillus casei was able to reduce S. aureus internalization into bovine mammary epithelial cells. This interesting property could help to counteract persistence of S. aureus infections. The beneficial properties of LAB in mastitis context have been mainly explored in vitro, whereas only few studies have evaluated LAB potential in vivo. Nevertheless, these in vivo studies revealed the lack of adverse effects of LAB on mammary tissues and promising results compared to conventional antibiotic treatment against mastitis. Altogether, these studies pointed out interesting properties of LAB that opens avenues to the development of alternative strategies to prevent or treat intramammary infections...|$|R
40|$|<b>Infectious</b> <b>mastitis</b> is {{a common}} {{condition}} among lactating women, with staphylococci and streptococci being the main aetiological agents. In this context, some lactobacilli strains isolated from breast milk appear to be particularly effective for treating mastitis and, therefore, constitute an attractive alternative to antibiotherapy. A (1) H NMR-based metabolomic approach was applied to detect metabolomic differences after consuming a probiotic strain (Lactobacillus salivarius PS 2) in women with mastitis. 24 h urine of women with lactational mastitis was collected at baseline and after 21 days of probiotic (PB) administration. Multivariate analysis (OSC-PLS-DA and hierarchical clustering) showed metabolome differences after PB treatment. The discriminant metabolites detected at baseline were lactose, and ibuprofen and acetaminophen (two pharmacological drugs commonly used for mastitis pain), while, after PB intake, creatine and the gut microbial co-metabolites hippurate and TMAO were detected. In addition, a voluntary desertion of the pharmacological drugs ibuprofen and acetaminophen was observed after probiotic administration. The application of NMR-based metabolomics enabled {{the identification of the}} overall effects of probiotic consumption among women suffering from mastitis and highlighted the potential of this approach in evaluating the outcomes of probiotics consumption. To our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that this approach has been applied in women with mastitis during lactation...|$|E
