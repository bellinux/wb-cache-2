25|$|After {{the release}} of the album, Deaf Havana {{spent a lot of time}} touring as a support band; they would not play a {{headline}} tour until April 2012, 5 months after {{the release of}} Fools and Worthless Liars. They began by supporting Skindred on their headline tour across Europe, followed by acting as support, alongside Tek-One, to Architects on their UK tour. Speaking before their April 2012 headline tour, which featured The Swellers and The Dangerous Summer as support, James Veck-Gilodi said: 'We are so excited to finally get out on the road and headline again. We've spent the last year or so writing and recording the album and been lucky enough to have some amazing support shows... but to be able to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>play</b> songs from Fools and Worthless Liars and headline is going to be great'. The band are due to play another headline tour, at larger venues, in November 2012. Support will come from There For Tomorrow and Canterbury. Deaf Havana had been due to travel to the USA to support There For Tomorrow in September 2012, but due to a problem with the arrival of their visas, this did not take place.|$|E

[...] "That {{was a really}} tough game," [...] he said, [...] "and full credit to Canada, but we can't beat top teams in the world when we only shoot at 34%, that was the key statistic." [...] Merritt, who had a British accent, {{said that she had}} [...] "the utmost respect for Canada.

5000|$|We never {{recorded}} as The Sisterhood, we just <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>played</b> some gigs. ... Andrew {{recorded as}} The Sisterhood, {{and since he}} released something prior to us he got to claim the name. ... To be terribly honest now, I think Andrew was right. I mean, {{two members of the}} band going off and trading on their old band? It's like two ex-members of The Mission going off and naming themselves as The Missionaries. It's a bit cheap.|$|R

All of a sudden, {{he came in and}} said, 'I'd like to try 'Dirge' on the piano.'...We put up a tape and he said to Robbie, 'Maybe you could play guitar on this.'

500|$|Prior to the {{beginning}} of the 2008 season, Hester stated that he would not attend the Bears' summer camp unless the team offered him a new contract. He further voiced his displeasure with his current contract in a phone interview with the Chicago Tribune, commenting, [...] "I can’t <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>play</b> this year making $445,000. Come on, man." [...] Adam Schefter believed that the Bears were puzzled over how Hester should be classified (as a wide receiver or a return specialist of such a star caliber), and be offered a contract accordingly. After receiving a $30,000 fine for not attending two days of training, Hester returned to the team's camp. The team later offered him a new four-year contract extension, worth over $40 million.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the suite has always been mixed, and all band members have expressed negativity toward it in recent times. Gilmour has said the album was [...] "a load of rubbish. We were at a real down point ... I think we were scraping the barrel a bit at that period" [...] and [...] "a good idea but it was dreadful... Atom Heart Mother sounds like we didn't have any idea between us, but we became much more prolific after it." [...] Similarly, in a 1984 interview on BBC Radio 1, Waters said [...] "If somebody said to me now – right – here's a million pounds, <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>play</b> Atom Heart Mother, I'd say you must be fucking joking." [...] Alec Dubro of Rolling Stone gave Atom Heart Mother a negative review, ultimately stating [...] "if Pink Floyd is looking for some new dimensions, they haven't found them here." ...|$|E

Despite having a prosperous career that allowed her to purchase the vehicle she wanted, Aaliyah revealed during her final interview on August 21, 2001 on 106 & Park that she had never owned a car due to living in New York City and hiring a car or driver on a regular basis.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is unknown}} {{of the extent}} of which Ray played with the Panhandles. While he did appear in photos {{advertising}} the Panhandles, he did not play in many games with the club. However why he played in so few games remains a mystery. According to family accounts, Ray sprained his ankle in a game one day, and they put liniment on it and put his sock and shoe back on. He <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>played</b> with it, <b>and</b> when they took the sock and shoe off, the skin just came right off of his foot.|$|R
5000|$|Band manager Rock Scully said [...] "Pigpen <b>went</b> <b>out</b> on {{the stage}} and sat down in a chair ... {{it was the only time}} he ever did it.

He <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> sat down {{on the stage}} — it was Valentine’s Day and he had a honey out in the crowd. He <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>played</b> ‘Katie Mae’ to her.

2500|$|As {{the main}} {{motivation}} for his decision, Lukather said: When Dave [...] retired that was REAL {{hard for me}} 'cause we started the band together. Hell, it's 35 years if you count High School where the core all met. When Mike [...] fell ill and had to leave that was it for me. If there isn't Paich {{or at least one}} Porcaro how can we even call it Toto? … Honestly, I have just had enough. This is NOT a break. It is over. I really can't <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>play</b> Hold The Line with a straight face anymore.|$|E
2500|$|... "It's really {{important}} if you're {{going to remain}} a valid band that you play your new stuff. Otherwise you become a parody of what you started out doing. But it's impossible [...] Back in the early 80s you could probably do it, but now with YouTube and downloading, the songs would all be out before the album was out. We did Somewhere Back in Time and that dealt with the 80s, and the time before that we did A Matter of Life and Death, just the one album. You can't <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>play</b> the greatest hits every time – it's important to play the newer songs because we really believe in them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Often {{recognized}} for their live performances, the band generally does not perform in larger venues such as arenas and amphitheaters {{outside of the}} UK. Instead, they regularly play smaller venues such as House of Blues, as was their intention from the start. Myles Kennedy {{said in an interview}} with Artistdirect, [...] "We're definitely a live band. That's what it's all about for us. We make records so we can <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>play</b> for people." [...] The band has been joined on stage by several surprise guests, including Slash, Paul Reed Smith, Wolfgang Van Halen, and Eric Friedman, and several other notable musicians, such as Eddie Van Halen, Jimmy Page, and John Paul Jones, have been reported to have attended an Alter Bridge concert. Alter Bridge's live performances are generally praised.|$|E
25|$|In 1963 Hibs, battling to {{come out}} of a slump, paid £7,500 for Neil Martin from Queen of the South. Martin's goals helped add impetus to the club, and on 1 April 1964, Jock Stein was {{appointed}} manager of Hibernian. Within months of becoming manager he led them to Summer Cup success. The testimony of his contemporaries was that he was already “miles” ahead of everyone else in his understanding of the game, and in studying how the investment of energy could be tailored to maximum effect.

2500|$|It's {{not really}} revenge, I think, if anything, it's redemption. But it's more about us, it's {{not so much}} about Tennessee. We didn't play very well last year when we went there and {{probably}} got caught a little too much focusing on them and the environment and that type of thing. So at practice this year, we're really just focusing on ourselves if we <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>play</b> to our potential then we'll have a chance to be successful. Last year we didn't come close to our potential so we had no chance. Of course it's a big game like it was last year, two ranked teams, so there's a lot of people watching it to see what's going on. It wasn't that we lost the game last year, I think it was the way we lost the game last year that was the devastating part of it, that hung with us so long.|$|E
