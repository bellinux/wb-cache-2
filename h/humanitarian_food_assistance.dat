40|$|The {{extensive}} {{literature on}} community {{participation in the}} targeting and management of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>food</b> <b>assistance</b> suggests that participatory approaches work best in slow-onset emergencies with no conflict or displacement. Yet the policies of many agencies [...] and compliance with Sphere minimum standards [...] require that the recipient community participate in decisions about the assistance they receive including targeting, regardless {{of the causes of}} the emergency. This paper analyzes current practice in the targeting and management of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>food</b> <b>assistance</b> in complex emergencies, the constraints to recipient communities' participation, and the possibilities for participatory approaches to improve targeting. Access and security considerations, limited staff time and capacity, and other constraints have long meant that the actual oversight of food aid distributions in complex emergencies is left in the hands of local leaders at the village or camp level. Introduced institutions include Food Relief Committees, or other specially-organized bodies to deal with targeting and distribution questions. Differences in the accountability and legitimacy of these leaders and committees, together with post-distribution dynamics over which agencies have little control, account for much of the way in food assistance is actually distributed and utilized. But much of the process of food aid targeting remains opaque to recipients, who are often not aware of their entitlements or the process of determining who is entitled. The paper concludes with a number of practical suggestions to improve participation in targeting in complex emergencies.

These three procurement categories much differ from each other in terms of the manner of procurement implementation. WFP has three important external actors, that is: Governments, Companies and NGOs.

40|$|Access to {{antiretroviral}} therapy (ART) {{for human}} immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has expanded rapidly throughout sub-Saharan Africa, but malnutrition and food insecurity have emerged as major barriers {{to the success of}} ART programs. Protein-calorie malnutrition (a common form of malnutrition in the region) hastens HIV disease progression, and food insecurity is a barrier to medication adherence. Analyses of patient outcomes have identified a low body mass index after the start of ART as an independent predictor of early mortality, but the causes of a low body mass index are multifactorial (eg, normal anthropometric variation, chronic inadequate food intake, and/or wasting associated with HIV infection and other infectious diseases). Although there is much information on population-level <b>humanitarian</b> <b>food</b> <b>assistance,</b> few data exist to measure the effectiveness of macronutrient supplementation or to identify individuals most likely to benefit.

40|$|In their {{excellent}} Seminar on iodine-deficiency disorders (Oct 4, p 1251), 1 Michael Zimmermann {{and colleagues}} highlight the growing problem of excess iodine intake in some sub-Saharan African countries. However, {{they do not}} address concerns regarding excessive iodine intake in refugee and displaced populations within the region. Sub-Saharan Africa has an estimated 16 million refugees and displaced people, many of whom rely on iodised salt provided through food aid from regional governments and international aid agencies. 2 A survey in refugee settlements across several African countries including Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Zambia, and Algeria revealed excessive dietary iodine associated with overiodisation of salt supplies. 3 A similar situation was reported in Sudanese children dependent on <b>humanitarian</b> <b>food</b> <b>assistance.</b> 4 These reports call for urgent monitoring of iodisation in displaced African populations. Vigilance is particularly required where migrant flows arise from severely deficient areas. As noted by Zimmermann and colleagues, precipitous increases in iodine can be harmful in individuals with pre-existing thyroid autonomy (ie, thyroids that can function {{in the absence of}} thyroid-stimulating hormone). The recorded deaths in Zimbabwe in the 1990 s should serve as a reminder that iodine-induced hyperthyroidism is not always benign in poor communities with limited access to health-care facilities. 5 Nevertheless, the risks of iodisation should in no way deter from the ultimate goal of eliminating iodine deficiency. Rather, the task ahead must focus on developing sustainable systems for systematic collection of iodine nutrition data in African populations. Such information will allow appropriate correction of iodine deficiency with safe levels of iodisation...|$|E
40|$|After the North Korean test {{of seven}} medium and long range {{missiles}} on July 4, 2006 and the partially successful {{test of a}} nuclear explosive on October 9, 2006, the international community acted with unity and strength by way of UN resolutions 1695 and 1718 to prevent further tests of missiles, {{as well as a}} second nuclear test of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). On the one hand, the new international sanctions were designed to punish North Korea for its provocative acts; yet on the other, the door should be kept open to bring them back to the Six-party Talks. For this reason, civil goods were excluded from sanctions. The European Union condemned these tests immediately and participated in the sanctions of the UN. The EU is not a major protagonist in countering the proliferation efforts of the leadership in Pyongyang. On the contrary, {{with the end of the}} Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) in May 2006, Brussels had lost its last instrument of influence regarding the nuclear ambitions of North Korea directly. Keeping in mind that the DPRK has become the greatest threat to global proliferation through its retreat from the Non-proliferation Treaty in 2003 and through its declaration to enter the status of a nuclear weapon state in February 2005, the inactivity of the EU comes as a surprise. In 2003 Brussels developed, as an alternative answer to the U. S. invasion of Iraq, its own multilateral strategy to fight the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, mainly by means of diplomacy. In spite of the fact that it has become highly engaged in nuclear nonproliferation efforts in the region, it lacks a comprehensive engagement strategy to counter the nuclear efforts of the North Korean leadership. This report describes Brussels’ relations towards Pyongyang in three areas that were most important for both sides since 1995 : 1. Support of American non-proliferation efforts towards North Korea. 2. Humanitarian aid for the North Korean people and 3. Development of economic trade relations with Pyongyang. Compared to other major protagonists in the region, the EU offered only minor financial assistance to the U. S. led KEDO program with a two percent share. Nearly three times higher, the absolute financial value of its <b>humanitarian</b> <b>food</b> <b>assistance</b> for North Korea was also surpassed by several other countries (e. g. USA, Republic of Korea). Trade relations with North Korea are not important for the EU and can be easily replaced because the DPRK has no goods of strategic value, like crude oil in the case of Iran. For Pyongyang, trade relations with the EU are more important, because it shared 12 percent of its total trade with the European Union. Here the EU has some leverage. As a consequence of the nuclear crisis the EU has reduced its financial support and bilateral economic relations since 2004. Because the outcome of the present nuclear crisis is difficult to predict, two different scenarios are discussed: The best outcome would be the “complete nuclear disarmament” of the DPRK. A less optimal but still constructive outcome would be a “constrained nuclear arms race” in the region. An unconstrained arms competition seems unlikely, beII cause North Korea alone, even if nuclear armed, appears too weak to justify such an effort for major protagonists in the region. Europe has some unique advantages for a greater engagement in order to support the regulation of the nuclear crisis. It was not involved in the Korean war from 1950 - 53 and has no strategic interests at stake. In contrast to major parts of the Bush administration, it rejects a strategy for regime change. Since 2001 the EU and its member states have increased their diplomatic presence in Pyongyang and therefore, compared to other countries like the USA and Japan, have better access to information about the North Korean leadership. This can be used cautiously in order to increase the leverage of Brussels. But a greater engagement of the European Union also faces some serious hurdles. First and foremost, the EU is more interested in U. S. cooperation in order to regulate the nuclear crisis with Iran. Therefore, Brussels has subordinated its non-proliferation policy regarding the DPRK to this goal and has avoided challenging the conservative U. S. government with its alternative non-proliferation strategy. Secondly, the EU members are split about the right strategy to engage North Korea for structural reasons. Some members of the EU (France, UK) possess nuclear weapons; others (Germany, Italy, Greece) are interested in the nuclear commitment of the USA; and others (Sweden, Ireland, Austria) reject the possession of nuclear weapons. Thirdly, the lack of transparency in the North Korean economy and the strong influence of the North Korean military in the economy, which is at present a major obstacle for economic reform in this country, complicates any serious engagement of the European Union. Under these circumstances, the EU can contribute better when multilateral cooperation works between all parties of the Six-party Talks and the DPRK is ready for nuclear disarmament. Political measures to strengthen multilateralism and to support the nonproliferation regime convincingly, can help to create a more conducive environment for negotiations and reduce tensions between the USA and China. EU assistance with economic reforms in the DPRK can increase the political flexibility of the North Korean leadership. In this regard, Brussels can broaden the economic, commercial and social activities of its Chamber of Commerce in Korea; develop a follow-up strategy for its first EU-DPRK country strategy of 2001; negotiate new development programs with Pyongyang; enhance economic transparency for foreign investments in special economic areas; support membership of Pyongyang in the World Bank; and accept negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement with South Korea, including the special North Korean Kaesong area. Furthermore, measures to support the North Korean nuclear disarmament should strengthen the norms of international non-proliferation, help Pyongyang, and reduce the costs for the five members of the Six-party process. In this regard the EU can try to regain a leading role in the follow-up organization of KEDO; contribute to the delivery of energy and/or revival of the light water reactor program; offer financial and technical assistance for the dismantlement of nuclear facilities and equipment; expand these efforts to other categories of WMD (chemical, biological weapons); contribute to a negative security assurance through France and the United Kingdom; and offer seminars on the transfer of European experience with military transparency and confidence building measures. III This list of possible measures shows that the EU has many tools to support the sixparty process. Because the present status of a North Korean uranium enrichment program is uncertain, it does not seem to be an immediate threat to proliferation. There is still time to resolve it. A compromise on the North Korea plutonium program can pave the way and build the necessary confidence to facilitate a regulation afterwards. If the Six-party process fails and North Korea deploys a rudimentary nuclear deterrence force, compensatory security measures are essential to secure the control of these weapons and to reduce the risk of their inadvertent use, and to prevent a ‘use or lose’ position for reasons of stability. Some kind of predictability and accountability together with transparency (although limited), seems necessary to preserve essential cooperation in the region. Here again, the European Union can assist in linking further economic incentives to the DPRK through the fulfillment of certain minimum standards of military confidence and security building measures. It can supplement this with offers by certain member countries to host seminars on military confidence-building. The DPRK has no resources or capabilities for a quick nuclear build-up and, because the option of unification (and then a fast nuclear disarmament) is always possible, Japan and South Korea should not overreact to a nuclear capable North Korea. The European Union should help the international community to convince Tokyo and Seoul that they should further stay in the Non-proliferation Treaty. However, the EU has only limited means to support the six-party process and it lacks the capability to force the main parties back to the negotiating table. It can use persuasion and offer limited incentives, but without a strategic change in its approach to the Sixparty Talks by one or both of the main protagonists, success seems less likely. And without a better outlook for these negotiations, Europe will be unable to develop a new consensus for the necessary engagement measures...|$|E

In this paper, we study three <b>food</b> <b>assistance</b> initiatives, in the Netherlands, Italy and Ireland, that perform new <b>food</b> <b>assistance</b> practices while embedded in specific institutional contexts, and analyse their potential to transform the food system, drawing on Transformative Social Innovation theory.

With {{an increase in the}} number of people affected by complex emergencies and the number of people displaced in urban settings, the international community must adapt intervention strategies to meet the specific demands and contexts of this population. The study aimed to provide information on food security and livelihoods for Iraqi refugees in Syria and Jordan to inform humanitarian assistance planning. National cross-sectional cluster sample surveys of displaced Iraqi populations displaced were conducted in Jordan (October 2008) and Syria (March 2009). Clusters of ten households were randomly selected using probability-based sampling; a total of 1200 and 813 Iraqi households in Jordan and Syria, respectively, were interviewed about food security and receipt of humanitarian assistance. In Syria, 60 % of households reported the household food situation had declined since the arrival period as compared to 46 % in Jordan. Food aid receipt was reported by 18. 0 % of households in Jordan and 90. 3 % of households in Syria. In Jordan, 10. 2 % of households received cash assistance and in Syria 25. 3 % of households received cash assistance. In Jordan, cash assistance was associated with low socioeconomic status, large household size, and UNHCR registration.

40|$|A {{growing number}} of people in high income countries, also from the {{segments}} of population once considered secure, seek <b>food</b> <b>assistance.</b> Diverse <b>food</b> aid initiatives and practices are developed by a range of actors to tackle food poverty; alongside traditional difficulties, new challenges emerge from welfare expenditure cuts, the reorganization of EU Funds for the Most Deprived (FEAD) and from the spreading of surplus food recovery practices by private companies. Based on a preliminary analysis on <b>food</b> <b>assistance</b> practices in Tuscany (Italy), it emerged that operators involved in <b>food</b> <b>assistance</b> activities are reflecting upon future developments: how is <b>food</b> <b>assistance</b> re-thinking its role to deal with the challenges posed by the current context of change? This work adopts a participatory scenario approach to examine pathways that can be considered robust under uncertainties in the planning context of <b>food</b> <b>assistance.</b> We combine the strengths of back-casted planning, which develops desirable pathways for the future, and explorative scenarios that describe plausible future contexts. Results comprise the definition of shared priority themes and plans tested across a set of downscaled scenarios. The methodology provides a promising learning tool to engage with stakeholders and foster a creative future oriented thinking approach to <b>food</b> <b>assistance</b> system’s vulnerability and resilience...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{efficacy}} {{of public and private}} <b>food</b> <b>assistance</b> in alleviating <b>food</b> shortages among poor households by considering the effects of all major forms of domestic food assistance– the Food Stamp Program, WIC, and food pantries. The analyses are based on detailed data that were collected in 1993 from 398 low-income households in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. This research adds to the knowledge base on {{the efficacy of}} public and private <b>food</b> <b>assistance</b> in alleviating <b>food</b> shortages among poor households by jointly considering the effects of both public and private forms of <b>food</b> <b>assistance.</b> After reconsidering standard food consumption models, the analysis modifies these models to account for misspecification and extends these models to include the effects of both public and private <b>food</b> <b>assistance.</b> Then, we examine the effect each of the widely available forms of <b>food</b> <b>assistance</b> has on helping poor households acquire enough resources to potentially meet basic nutritional requirements. Research findings suggest that compared with other forms of <b>food</b> <b>assistance,</b> the receipt of a significant amount in food stamps has a much greater impact on whether a household attains at least the Thrifty Food Plan than the receipt of food from a food pantry or through the WIC program...|$|R
