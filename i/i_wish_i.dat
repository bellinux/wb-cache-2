5|$|Do <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> {{had never}} endured post-partum depression? Absolutely. But {{to deny the}} {{experience}} is to deny who I am. I still mourn the loss of what could have been, but I also feel deep gratitude for those who stood by me, for the lesson that we must never be afraid to ask for help, and for the feeling of summer that still remains.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could dissent {{from the}} general, though not universal, chorus of dispraise that has greeted this long-awaited and fairly long-delayed opera; but unless it has secrets to yield up – {{and one of}} the main reasons for feeling so dispirited as it went on was the sense that one might be even more bored, if possible, during a {{subsequent}} hearing than during the first – the majority verdict is all too depressingly right.|$|E

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> {{could give}} you an idea of the beauty of the {{situation}} of this house.

25|$|The vibrato {{sound is}} incredible, {{and it took}} a long time. I put down the rhythm track on an Epiphone Casino through a Fender Twin Reverb without vibrato. Then we played the track back through four old Twins, one on each side. We had to keep all the amps {{vibrating}} in time to the track and each other, so we had to keep stopping and starting the track, recording it in 10-second bursts... <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could remember exactly how we did the slide part – not writing it down is one of the banes of my life! We did it in three passes through a harmonizer, set to some weird interval, like a sixth. There was a different harmonization for each pass. For the line in harmonics, I retuned the guitar so that I could play it all at the 12th fret with natural harmonics. It's doubled several times.|$|E

500|$|In 2005, Song began {{appearing}} {{in the role of}} spoiled heiress London Tipton in the Disney Channel Original Series, The Suite Life of Zack & Cody. The role was named [...] "Paris" [...] in an early script and alludes to Paris Hilton (London spoofing Paris, and Tipton {{is the name of the}} hotel her father owns in the show). She got the role without an audition and was surprised to find her friend Ashley Tisdale working in the show. Song says, [...] "London is my fantasy person, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could be her. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> had her closet." ...|$|E
500|$|James Earl Jones' guest {{appearance}} in this episode, {{as well as}} in [...] "Treehouse of Horror" [...] and [...] "Das Bus", was listed seventh on IGN's [...] "Top 25 Simpsons Guest Appearances" [...] list. Jones ranked 25th on AOL's list of their favorite 25 The Simpsons guest stars. Matt Groening said that this line is among his favorite lines in the show. David Mirkin said that Homer's line, [...] "Oh <b>I</b> <b>wish,</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> hadn't killed that fish", is one of his favorites in the show, and that the alternate future in which the family are rich [...] "breaks [...] heart every time". Homer's line [...] "close enough" [...] from Time and Punishment was later used in the Stargate SG-1 episode [...] "Moebius".|$|E

500|$|Thief was {{the first}} 3D stealth game for a {{personal}} computer, and its stealth gameplay innovations influenced later games in the genre. The game has been cited as {{the first to use}} light and shadow as a stealth mechanic, and the first to use audio cues, such as the ability to eavesdrop on conversations and alert guards with loud footsteps. The game's use of sound wave propagation, which allowed sounds to travel around corners and through rooms, became widely considered by game developers. Thiefs influence has been recognized in other stealth games, such as Assassin's Creed, Hitman, Splinter Cell, and Tenchu. Marc Laidlaw, writer and designer on Half-Life, said that [...] "Thief is the single most terrifying, immersive, and rewarding game I have played and the one single-player game I continue to replay. [...] There are countless books <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> had written; Thief {{is one of the few}} games <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> had worked on." [...] Laidlaw called Thief his favorite game, an opinion shared by Fallout 3 lead designer Emil Pagliarulo.|$|E
500|$|Initially, Drummond was unrepentant, telling The Observer in 2000 that he couldn't imagine ever feeling regret unless {{his child}} was ill and only [...] "an {{expensive}} clinic" [...] could cure him. [...] By 2004, however, he had {{admitted to the}} BBC the difficulty of explaining his decision. [...] "It's a hard one to explain to your kids and it doesn't get any easier. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could explain why I did it so people would understand." ...|$|E

500|$|Levin made no pretence of even-handedness. There were {{politicians}} {{he liked}} and politicians {{he did not}} like. For those in the latter category, [...] "Taper's lacerations wounded". He invented unflattering nicknames; he wrote later, [...] "I did not (though <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> had) think of calling Sir Hartley Shawcross Sir Shortly Floorcross, but I did call Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller Sir Reginald Bullying-Manner". When the latter was elevated to the peerage as Lord Dilhorne, Levin renamed him Lord Stillborn.|$|E
500|$|Vandernoot recalled, [...] "I think I {{was quite}} close to Tessa, she was very well written, very easy to play and <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> was like that. I'm not sure I'd like that but... it's very nice, you know, to play a {{character}} with nice feelings and nice emotions." [...] Vandernoot had {{to adapt to the}} North American way of filming series and learn to work fast. She said that filming the series was [...] "...exhausting but formative", and that filming in English was [...] "challenging". Vandernoot, who is a native French speaker, had a dialect coach.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] speak of heartbreak and are direct, {{referring}} to the subject by his first name, Drew. The song describes fancying someone who already interested in someone else and, therefore, maintaining the sentiments a secret. To him, Swift acted {{as though she was}} happy about his relationship, while crying and lamenting at home. Dave Heaton of PopMatters interpreted the lines [...] "And there she goes, so perfectly / The kind of flawless <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could be" [...] to address Swift's ideal of perfection and her attempting to meet it, but not succeeding, a predominant theme on Fearless.|$|E

500|$|The critic from The Sunday Times {{considered}} Fleming to have [...] "a sensational imagination, but {{informed by}} style, zest and—above all—knowledge". Anthony Boucher wrote that [...] "As usual, Ian Fleming has less {{story to tell}} in 90,000 words than Buchan managed in 40,000; but Thunderball is still an extravagant adventure". The critic for the Daily Herald implored [...] "Hey!—that man is taking his clothes off again. So is the girl... Can anybody stop this? Unfortunately not. Not {{this side of the}} best-seller lists. I don't envy Mr Bond's wealthy creator, Ian Fleming. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could pity him", whilst L.G. Offord considered Thunderball to be [...] "just about as wild as ever, with a walloping climax." ...|$|E
500|$|Newman, a {{professional}} artist from Minneapolis, {{responded to the}} curators' cogitation by describing how the image came into being. She bought used canvases while a poor art student, and was unsure {{how to use a}} canvas with these dimensions. Inspired by a cartoon of a dachshund, she chose that as a subject, but was unhappy with the effect until she added a hula skirt she had seen in a magazine, and colored dog bones she spied in a pet store. Newman wrote to them, saying [...] "I almost threw it out until I heard of MOBA. After many years of slashing rejected work, now <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> had saved them all for you." ...|$|E
500|$|Lovato had no {{interest}} in forging a relationship with her late father, Patrick, after his divorce from her mother. She has been vocal about her abusive and strained relationship with her father and once stated, [...] "He was mean, but {{he wanted to be a}} good person. And he wanted to have his family, and when my mom married my stepdad, he still had this huge heart where he said, 'I'm so glad that [...] taking care of you and doing the job that <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could do'." [...] She has written multiple songs about him. Patrick died of cancer on June 22, 2013, at age 53. After his death, Lovato said that he had been mentally ill, and in his honor she created the Lovato Treatment Scholarship Program.|$|E
5000|$|After The Gnome-Mobile, [...] "the kids" [...] {{no longer}} kept {{in contact with}} each other.

That was - so unexpected. ... <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>I</b> had picked up the phone over the years, <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>I</b> had treated him more like a brother; but he's indelibly printed in all of our minds, he's eternal.

50|$|Each Make-A-Wish chapter follows {{specific}} {{policies and}} guidelines for granting a child’s wish. Make-A-Wish {{works closely with}} the wish child’s physician and family to determine the most appropriate time to grant the wish, keeping in mind the child’s treatment protocol or other concerns. Most wish requests fall into five categories: <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> to go, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> to be, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> to meet, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> to have, or <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> to give.|$|R
