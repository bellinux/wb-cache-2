The blockhouse itself fell out of use as a magazine in 1834, being briefly used as a government store, and the adjacent gun platforms were sold off in 1835. The blockhouse building was subsequently demolished in 1844.|$|E
5|$|Cray had {{intended}} to use gallium arsenide circuitry in the Cray-2, which would not only offer much higher switching speeds but also used less energy and thus ran cooler as well. At the time the Cray-2 was being designed, the state of GaAs manufacturing simply was {{not up to the}} task of supplying a supercomputer. By the mid-1980s, things had changed and Cray decided {{it was the only way}} forward. Given a lack of <b>investment</b> <b>on</b> the part of large chip makers, Cray decided to invest in a GaAs chipmaking startup, GigaBit Logic, and use them as an internal supplier.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, {{the city}} council changed their {{decision}} to close down the tramway. The main reason was the 1973 oil crisis, which had made it cheaper to run hydroelectric-powered trams than diesel-powered buses. After no <b>investment</b> <b>on</b> the tramway for seventeen years, new stock had to be bought, and Oslo Sporveier opted to buy seven used M-23 units from the Gothenburg Tramway in Sweden. In addition, twenty-five SL79 articulated trams were delivered in 1982 and 1983, followed by a further fifteen in 1989 and 1990. Oslo Sporveier merged with Holmenkolbanen in 1991, and with Ekebergbanen in 1993.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th century, private turnpike {{companies}} {{constructed and}} improved {{a few of}} the more important roadways in the state. Turnpikes were chartered by the state and privately financed, with tolls collected at toll houses every few miles along the road. The first turnpike in Delaware was the Newport Gap Pike, which was built in 1808 and completed to Wilmington in 1811. Many other turnpikes were constructed in northern New Castle County radiating from Wilmington and connected the industrial city to agricultural areas. The turnpikes were built as straight roads in order to reduce costs. Many of these roads were constructed with a macadam surface. During the course of the 19th century, new methods of transportation such as canals and railroads came about and there was less <b>investment</b> <b>on</b> roads. The revenues of the turnpike companies fell and roads became more of a local concern.|$|E
5|$|According to Bruce, {{men were}} needed to allow Australia's {{extensive}} resources to be developed. In 1923, much of Australia's land was virtually unoccupied, and Bruce believed Australia {{had the potential to}} be one of the most fertile and productive nations in the world, which could sustain populations upward of 100 million over time more than 16 times the population of his time. Despite dissenting voices from scientists, who noted that poor climate, soils and water availability were significant barriers to large populations, the Bruce-Page government enacted policies to encourage large numbers of British to migrate to Australia. Under the auspices of the new Development and Migration Commission, £34 million in loans took place over the decade starting in 1924 to facilitate immigrant settlement through improvements to rural infrastructure, land access, and subsidising immigrant journeys ("passages"). Estimates as high as half a million British immigrants over ten years were predicted at the start of the policy, whereas just over 200,000 travelled to Australia during that time period. Bruce's settlement plan rested on rural growth. Migrants were often selected on the basis of their willingness to work on the land; state and Commonwealth governments concentrated their <b>investment</b> <b>on</b> rural development and encouraged returned servicemen to take up farms on the periphery of settled areas. Despite this, a majority of these migrants settled in urban areas, as Australia's rural areas were far more remote and difficult to work (than for example England's) and many of those taking advantage of the assistance scheme were urban workers or family and friends of those already settled. Immigration from outside Great Britain and her dominions was considered unpalatable the Bruce government upheld the White Australia policy by placing strong restrictions on immigration from other areas, notwithstanding its population growth targets.|$|E
5|$|The {{project is}} funded through an equity {{contribution}} of about USD 200m from Diwaco, a USD 300m grant and a USD 100m stand-by facility from the Jordanian government, {{as well as}} USD 475m in foreign loans to Diwaco. The project's total cost {{is expected to be}} $1.1 billion USD. The U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation has lent USD 250m to Diwaco to support U.S. foreign <b>investment</b> <b>on</b> the basis that General Electric partially owns GAMA Energy. The state-owned French bank PROPARCO, which is the part of the French Development Agency (AFD) that supports private sector development, and the European Investment Bank (EIB) each lent about USD 100m to Diwaco. The loan package has been put together by the Arab Banking Corporation. Much of the government grant supporting the project comes from sovereign soft loans that the government of Jordan has borrowed from the EIB and AFD and passes on as a grant to the project. AFD provided USD 50m for the state grant and USD 48m for the stand-by facility.|$|E
