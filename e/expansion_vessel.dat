A combination of Langmuir and Pitot probe measurements provide information on the total ion flux generated by the plasma source (cascaded arc).

To provide maximum neutron flux intensities with high availability for scattering experiments a conceptual liquid hydrogen moderator cooling circulation design proposal was developed. Supercritical hydrogen at 17 K will be utilized to absorb energy of the incoming neutrons in two parallel moderator vessels. A helium refrigerator provides the necessary cooling capacity by implementing an additional helium expansion turbine downstream the refrigerator coldbox.

40|$|Abstract – The {{stagnation}} procedure generally can {{be divided}} into five typical phases. In phases where steam occurs energy is transported very effectively from the collector to other system components and leads to high temperature loads. Solar systems should be constructed {{in such a way that}} at the end of the phase where liquid is pushed out of the collector the residual content of liquid in the collector is as low as possible in order to minimise the thermal loads on system components and the heat transfer fluid. The Stagnation behaviour can be quantified. Collectors with good emptying behaviour exhibit short lasting maximum steam power values of up to 50 W for each m of collector area whereas Collectors with bad emptying behaviour stress the system with long lasting maximum steam power values of up to 120 W/m. On the basis of these values and the specific heat losses of the return and flow lines at the temperature of ebullition the range of the steam area and the volume of steam can be calculated. In this way one can decide if temperature sensitive components will be reached from steam and if measures to improve the stagnation behaviour will be necessary. One of this improvements is the use of a simple stagnation cooler to minimise the steam volume. The knowledge of the maximum steam volume allows the correct dimensioning of the membrane <b>expansion</b> <b>vessel...</b>|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Monocyte activation, {{macrophage}} infiltration, vascular {{oxidative stress}} and matrix proteolysis are inflammatory key steps contributing to abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) development. A phenotypical and functional heterogeneity is recognizable in monocytes by the differential expression of surface molecules: CD 62 L- subset corresponds to activated monocytes, while CD 143 /ACE surface expression increases during their differentiation into macrophages. In this work, Resveratrol, {{which is an}} antioxidant polyphenol with vasoprotective properties, has been evaluated for its potential to limit aneurysm development and monocyte-dependent inflammatory response in a model of elastase-induced AAA. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats received Resveratrol (10 mg/kg/die) (Rsv group, n = 15) or vehicle (ethanol) alone (Et-OH group, n = 15) continuously from 7 d before until 14 d after the AAA induction with elastase; five littermates were used as untreated control group (Ctr group, n = 5). At the end of treatment, CD 143 and CD 62 L monocyte expression was analyzed by flow cytometry, serum antioxidant capacity was evaluated using the TRAP method and circulating TNFα, and MMP- 9 were measured with ELISA and gel zymography, respectively. Aortas were subjected to histology and immunohistochemistry for morphological analysis, macrophage infiltration, and MMP- 9, TNFα, and VEGF expression. RESULTS: Resveratrol counteracted the CD 62 L-monocyte subset expansion, CD 143 monocyte expression, and circulating levels of MMP- 9 activity and TNFα associated to AAA induction. Similarly, treatment with Resveratrol significantly attenuated AAA <b>expansion,</b> <b>vessel</b> wall macrophage infiltration and MMP- 9, VEGF, and TNFα expression, compared with AAA from Et-OH group.

This {{study was}} {{designed}} to define and contrast the mechanisms of lumen enlargement from coronary balloon angioplasty and directional coronary atherectomy using intracoronary ultrasound imaging in vivo. Background. The mechanisms of lumen enlargement produced by percutaneous transluminal coronary balloon angioplasty and directional coronary atherectomy are not known because the coronary artery wall has not previously been studied both before and after dilation. Methods. We used intracoronary ultrasound to quantitate coronary lumen, vessel and plaque area both before and immediately after successful coronary angioplasty (n = 30) and directional coronary atherectomy (n = 25) at the site of most severe stenosis. Results. Angioplasty increased lumen area by 2. 80 ± 0. 25 mm 2 (mean ± SE, p < 0. 0001). Eighty-one percent of this lumen gain resulted from an increase in vessel area and the remaining 19 % from a reduction in plaque area. Lumen gain of individual lesions was separated into three groups: 67 % had an increase in <b>vessel</b> area (<b>vessel</b> <b>expansion),</b> 13 % had a decrease in plaque area and 20 % had a combination of both. In contrast, <b>vessel</b> <b>expansion</b> contributed only 22 % of the lumen gain with directional coronary atherectomy, with the majority (78 %) of increase in lumen size coming from a reduction in plaque area. Directional coronary atherectomy increased from 2. 36 ± 0. 05 to 7. 00 ± 0. 28 mm 2 (p < 0. 0001). Plaque reduction was the sole mechanism in 60 % of lesions, <b>vessel</b> <b>expansion</b> was the sole mechanism in 12 % and a combination of both mechanisms occurred in 28 %. Lumen enlargement of eccentric lesions treated with directional coronary atherectomy was more commonly associated with plaque reduction (p < 0. 02), whereas eccentricity did not affect the mechanism of lumen enlargement with coronary angioplasty. Conclusions. This is the first study to systematically examine the coronary artery wall in vivo at the site of a severe stenosis both before and after catheter-based interventions in humans. Lumen enlargement from coronary asgioptasty occurs predominantly from <b>vessel</b> <b>expansion</b> or stretching, although a reduction in plaque area contributes to the lumen gain in many patients and is the sole mechanism in a few. Lumen gain from directional coronary atherectomy is predominantly from reduction in plaque area (probably owing to tissue removal), although vessel stretching (balloon effect) occurs and is the sole mechanism in a small minority of vessels. Plaque reduction is more common in directional coronary atherectomy of eccentric lesions...|$|R

From the assigned Lyman transitions, also density distributions of the internal energy of the three molecules were determined, close to the exit of the arc. Although the expanding plasma is in ¯rst order identical to a hot gas expansion, the H 2, HD and D 2 density distributions cannot be described by a Boltzmann distribution. Instead, each distribution is described by two Boltzmann distributions, with di®erent temperatures. The ¯rst temperature describes the distribution for the low rotational states and the second temperature describes the distribution for the high rotational states. These temperatures are determined to be 700 K and 3800 K for H 2, 500 K and 3400 K for HD and 300 K and 3000 K for D 2.

On these not-classified resources are not subject to some duties under this Act, especially the obligation to prepare an emergency documentation (except where the regional authority include in the emergency plan then must provide and update the required documents). This paper doesn´t discuss by the massive leakage of 22 tons of ammonia. On the basis of analyzes were identified two sources of the risk. The first is a reservoir about the content of 10 tons which is located {{on the roof of the}} engine room. Maximum real filling is around 6 tons. The second source of risk is an expansion tank about the content of 14 tons, which is located in the building with cylinderconicals tanks (CKT). Considered fulfillment of the <b>expansion</b> <b>vessel</b> is about 7 tons. Although in this case is not about buildings and facility in which is treated with such a amount of dangerous chemical substances, which would belonged to the relevant group, I will perform available analysis according to a regulations issued or supportively used to analysis and risk assessment in according to the Act No. 59 / 2006 Coll., concerning prevention of major accidents. Harmful effects of ammonia are another important aspect. According to the Notice of the Ministry of Interior No. 103 / 2006 Coll., concerning establish principles defining the emergency planning zone and the extent and method of preparation of an external emergency plan, ammonia is taken as moderately toxic substance that irritates the eyes, mucous membranes, and in high concentrations can cause death. The great advantage from the point of view of the protection inhabitants are the warning properties. Characteristic pungency is already known in very weak concentrations. Also disposal of hazardous concentrations isn't technologically challenging, due to its solubility in the water. Another dangerous effect, except the toxicity is its explosiveness (explosive limit from 15 to 28 %) and flammability. Fortunately controlled condensing pressure prevents ignition and explosion of ammonia. Risk of the explosion and ignition of ammonia isn´t analyzed in this thesis, because the range of effects caused by leakage of several tons, is from a toxicological point of view more threatening. Impacts of hazardous concentrations aren´t threat only for people but also for animals and the environment. The thesis focuses on the analysis and evaluation of risks. The results of this research are an important element of the draft of emergency documentation. During the processing is calculated with methods IAEA-TECDOC- 727, Dow's Chemical Exposure Index, Estimation of toxicity and software modeling program ALOHA. Further research is being done by brainstorming and semi-standardized interviews with employees of the company. In conclusion of the thesis is appropriate the drafting of emergency cards and emergency documentation (although not in range under the Act of concerning prevention of major accidents), according to which the reaction proceeded for any leakage of dangerous chemicals (ammonia) into the environment and the protection of workers which occur at the public premises or in the premises of the zone of impact of ammonia spilled outside the area Budweiser Budvar, NC. The use of the draft of emergency documentation is also conditioned by the location of the object in relatively densely populated areas of the county town of České Budějovice...|$|E

Najprej smo definirali parametre ugodja, ki vplivajo na počutje v prostoru. To so: temperatura zraka, temperatura obodnih sten, relativna vla. nost zraka, gibanje zraka in kvaliteta zraka. To so parametri, katere moramo upo. tevati pri določitvi ogrevalnega sistema. V nadaljevanju smo predstavili elemente,ki so ključnega pomena pri centralnem ogrevanjukotel, dimnik, cevno omre. je, regulacija, ekspanzijska posoda, črpalke in ogrevala. Pri tehničnem izračunu smo najprej definirali generični poslovni prostor velikosti 100 m 2. Izračunali smo toplotne prehodnosti obodnih sten, definirali projektne {{temperature}} in na podlagi tega izračunali toplotne izgube za dva različna načina gradnje (manj in bolj izoliranega). Nato smo izračunali. tevilo radiatorskih ogreval pri radiatorskem sistemu ogrevanja in dol. ino cevi pri talnem sistemu ogrevanja. Na podlagi tega smo določili moč kotla in temperaturni re. im ogrevanja. Nato smo se osredotočili na ekonomski vidik diplomske naloge. Najprej smo ovrednotili nalo. be posameznih sistemov ogrevanja in vrednost nalo. be izolacije pri dodatno izolirani izvedbi stavbe. Izračunali smo porabo goriva in stro. ek ogrevanja na kurilno sezono za dva različna energenta (ekstra lahko kurilno olje in drva) in dve izvedbi gradnje. Glede na manj. e stro. ke ogrevanja pri izvedbi gradnje z bolj. o izolacijo, smo izračunali prihranek energije. Ali je smiselno investirati v dodatno izolacijo ali ne, smo se odločili po metodi interne stopnje prihranka. Na koncu smo analizirali vseh deset variant in določili najprimernej. o varianto ogrevanja za poslovni prostor. Glede na vrednost nalo. be in stro. ke ogrevanja je najbolj. a varianta tista, kjer imamo radiatorski visoko temperaturni ogrevalni sistem na trdno gorivo. Glede na funkcionalnost sistema, ugodje v prostoru in prihranek energije pa varianta, pri kateri imamo poslovni prostor dodatno izoliran in imamo nizko temperaturni ogrevalnisistem talnega ogrevanja z ekstra lahkim kurilnim oljem. S tem dose. emo najbolj. e ugodje v sistemu. The present work {{focuses on the}} issues of heating business premises. The question was posed about what should be taken into account when determiningthe heating system and what influences its cost efficiency. First, the comfort parameters that influence the general well-being in the room were defined. These are: air temperature, wall temperature, relative air humidity, air movement and quality. These are the parameters that have {{to be taken into account}} when determining the heating system. When carrying out a technical calculation, the generic business premise of the size of 100 m 2 was defined first. Heat conductance of the wallswas calculated and the project temperatures were defined. On the basis of this, heat losses for two different construction types (less and more insulated) were calculated. Afterwards, the number of segments used in the radiator heating system was established as well as the length of the pipes used in the under - floor heating system. Following this, the strength of the boiler and the temperature regime were determined. Further on, the elements of key importance in the central heating system werepresented: boiler, chimney, pipe network, regulation, <b>expansion</b> <b>vessel,</b> pumps and heating devices. Then the focus was placed on the cost effectiveness of the heating system. First, the evaluation of the investment in the specific heating systems and insulation of an extra insulated buildingwas carried out. The use of fuel and the costs of heating per one heating season for two different energy sources (extra light fuel oil and firewood) were determined for both construction types. Whether an investment in additional insulation is reasonable, was established by observing the internal level of savings. In conclusion all ten options of heating were analysed and the most suitable type for heating business premises was determined. Taking into account the value of the investment as well as the heating costs, the best type of heating is the high-temperature heating system using solid fuel. Considering the system functionality, room comfort and savings of energy, however, the best type of heating proves to be the one with an additionally insulated room and a low- temperature under - floor heating system using extra light fuel oil. The latter enables the best comfort within the system...|$|E
50|$|Just as {{the primary}} loads {{have their origin in}} some force, {{secondary}} loads are caused by displacement of some kind. For example, the pipe connected to a storage tank may be under load if the tank nozzle to which it is connected moves down due to tank settlement. Similarly, pipe connected to a vessel is pulled upwards because the vessel nozzle moves up due to <b>vessel</b> <b>expansion.</b> Also, a pipe may vibrate due to vibrations in the rotating equipment it is attached to.|$|R
