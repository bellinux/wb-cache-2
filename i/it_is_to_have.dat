5|$|On December 15, 2015, Heyward {{signed an}} eight-year, $184 million {{contract}} with the Cubs. One of his first acts after signing his contract was to pay for hotel suites {{large enough to accommodate}} teammate David Ross, his wife, and their three young children on all of the Cubs' road trips during the 2016 season. Ross, set to retire after the 2016 season, had been Heyward's teammate during his first three seasons in Atlanta, and Heyward considered him a key mentor in his early MLB career. In an interview with the Bleacher Report website, Heyward said,I know how special <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> teammates like he was my first three years in Atlanta. You don't take it for granted. I wanted to say thank you {{from the bottom of my}} heart, as a teammate and as a friend, for what he's done for me.|$|E
25|$|On 5 May 2015, the Jordanian {{contracting}} company Sadeen Group and the Government of Malta {{signed an agreement}} at Auberge de Castille for the former {{to set up a}} private educational institution called the American University of Malta (AUM). The university was planned to be set up in Spain, but Prime Minister of Malta Joseph Muscat persuaded the chairman of Sadeen, Hani Salah, to set it up in Malta. The university is to accommodate 4000 students, primarily from the Middle East, North Africa and Europe. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> colleges for engineering, arts, sciences, education and health. The project has an investment of over €115 million, and it is to create around 400 to 750 jobs. The project is to generate an increase of €48 to €85 million in economic growth.|$|E
25|$|The AMY1 gene {{copy number}} {{has been found}} to be {{correlated}} to different levels of starch in diets of different populations. 8 Populations from different continents were categorized into high starch diets and low starch diets and their AMY1 gene copy number was visualized using high resolution FISH and qPCR. It was found that the high starch diet populations which consists of the Japanese, Hadza, and European American populations had a significantly higher (2 times higher) average AMY1 copy number than the low starch diet populations including Biaka, Mbuti, Datog, Yakut populations. It was hypothesized that the levels of starch in one’s regular diet, the substrate for AMY1, can directly affect the copy number of the AMY1 gene. Since it was concluded that the copy number of AMY1 is directly correlated with salivary amylase, the more starch present in the population’s daily diet, the more evolutionarily favorable <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> multiple copies of the AMY1 gene. The AMY1 gene was the first gene to provide strong evidence for evolution on a molecular genetics level. Moreover, using comparative genomic hybridization, copy number variations of the entire genomes of the Japanese population was compared to that of the Yakut population. It was found that the copy number variation of the AMY1 gene was significantly different from the copy number variation in other genes or regions of the genome, suggesting that the AMY1 gene was under a strong selective pressure that had little or no influence on the other copy number variations. Finally, the variability of length of 783 microsatellites between the two populations were compared to copy number variability of the AMY1 gene. It was found that the AMY1 gene copy number range was larger than that of over 97% of the microsatellites examined. This implies that natural selection played a considerable role in shaping the average number of AMY1 genes in these two populations. However, as only 6 populations were studied, it is important to consider the possibility that there may be other factors in their diet or culture that influenced the AMY1 copy number other than starch.|$|E

He adds that its message could hopefully remind people {{that they have a}} choice when they arise in the morning whether to pursue their own choice of activities for the day, or to do what they should do or are obliged to do. Keira Knightley feels that the film's story is alarming, but has said that the film is [...] "more about humanity's ability to look the other way". [...] "You know in fact that if your morals can go out the window if you think you can survive in a certain way, whatever your morals may be".|$|E

[...] Contributors were drawn only from his early supporters, and contributions were limited to $1,000. Nixon was not to be informed of the names of contributors; however, the fundraising letter stated that Nixon [...] "will of course be very appreciative of your continuing interest". By October 30, 1951, some $16,000 had been raised, of which Nixon had spent approximately $12,000, principally from contributors in the Los Angeles area. The senator's Christmas card expense for 1950 and 1951 totaled $4,237.54.

The God Squad, however, was not well received: Canning described it as [...] "conveniently arriving {{for the sake of}} one storyline in this episode" [...] and debating [...] "a forced issue that we all knew would result in acceptance", and VanDerWerff pointed out that as [...] "we already know how the other three kids are going to shake out", it was [...] "surprisingly undramatic" [...] and its sole purpose to [...] "watch a new character decide if he's okay with gay people". Futterman, on the other hand, felt that the sequence [...] "tastefully incorporated religion's views into the show's ongoing look at gay relationships".|$|E

Club said [...] "Go Big or Go Home" [...] not only included many fun moments, but that the jokes felt [...] "fresher and more rambunctious" [...] than they had in the previous season, and that the shows seemed to have discovered [...] "a newfound sense of purpose". Gail Pennington of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch said [...] "Go Big and Go Home", along with the five other first episodes of the season [...] "couldn't be funnier". The Hollywood Reporter writer Tim Goodman felt the episode was a strong start to the season, and particularly praised Rob Lowe, whose character he said was [...] "really beginning to jell". Blogcritics writer Jerome Wetzel wrote, [...] "I can't express in words how good <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Parks and Recreation back on television." [...] Wetzel said the characters were so well defined that the show rivaled the ensemble cast of The Office, a comedy made by the same producers as Parks and Recreation. Zap2it writer Rick Porter wrote that Parks and Recreation [...] "was one of the two or three funniest comedies on TV when it finished its second season, and it begins its third season having lost none of its mojo".
