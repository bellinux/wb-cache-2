5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I {{want people}} to have a visceral and {{emotional}} reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{that it does not}} matter really what you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't {{want people to}} be thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E
5|$|On December 15, 2015, Heyward {{signed an}} eight-year, $184 million {{contract}} with the Cubs. One of his first acts after signing his contract was to pay for hotel suites {{large enough to accommodate}} teammate David Ross, his wife, and their three young children on all of the Cubs' road trips during the 2016 season. Ross, set to retire after the 2016 season, had been Heyward's teammate during his first three seasons in Atlanta, and Heyward considered him a key mentor in his early MLB career. In an interview with the Bleacher Report website, Heyward said,I know how special it is to have teammates like he was my first three years in Atlanta. You don't take it for granted. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> thank you {{from the bottom of my}} heart, as a teammate and as a friend, for what he's done for me.|$|E

500|$|Tony's doomed quest in the Brazilian jungle {{is framed}} in biblical terms; the {{relevant}} chapter title, [...] "In Search of a City" [...] alludes to Hebrews 13:14: [...] "For {{here we have}} no continuing city, but we seek one to come". However, Waugh remarked of the novel that it was [...] "humanist, and said all <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about humanism". He believed that the essential 20th century conflict was between Christianity and Chaos, and chose to present a chaotic world to demonstrate that civilisation did not have in itself the power to survive. Thus, in the Brazilian jungle, Tony encounters what Davis terms [...] "power without grace... secular feudalism unredeemed by the saving grace of Christianity". Todd is the symbol of humanist, irreligious power.|$|E
500|$|Madonna also {{understood}} that {{as she was}} growing up, so was her core audience. Feeling the need to attempt something different, she wanted {{the sound of her}} new album to dictate what could be popular in the music world. The singer had certain personal matters on her mind that she thought could be the musical direction of the album. For the title track, Madonna chose topics that until then had been personal meditations never to be shared with the general public. She perused of her personal journals and diaries, and began considering options. She recalled, [...] "What was it <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say?</b> I wanted the album to speak to things on my mind. It was a complex time in my life." ...|$|E

Henderson is a person with dwarfism from England, who was badly injured by being tossed by a rugby fan in a bar. The speech by Dinklage brought media and public attention to the act of dwarf-tossing with Henderson's name being trended worldwide on social media. Dinklage turned down offers from talk shows to discuss the topic. He later explained that 20 years earlier he might have accepted these offers but that he's a [...] "little bit more at peace with things now and I—said what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> I have a friend who says the world doesn't need another angry dwarf." ...|$|E

The only thing really frustrating for me, to be honest with you, is that sometimes people would write this idea that we were making it up as we went along and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'Really?' But I think now people are writing and saying, 'Oh yeah!' I'm excited for people to see it on DVD, because now that they know how it ended, [...] go back and see all of the little things, like people who have no reflections in mirrors. When you go back, you will see everything was set up." [...] When asked if the House [...] "pulled" [...] the Harmons to it, Murphy responded, [...] "I don't know if they were targeted. I don't think the Internet site had any supernatural pull to it...although that would have been hilarious. I thought it was two things: it was house porn because I think that house really is extraordinary. And also I think there's always that allure in American lives of the fresh start, moving West, starting fresh." ...|$|E
500|$|Vernon {{recorded}} his lines {{in a separate}} recording studio {{than most of the}} album. Vernon described the studio as a [...] "tiny black room". He would record a line in the room, and then shortly later West would come in and play back what was recorded, and then discuss what needed to be changed. They repeated that process a few times until the song was finished. Vernon expressed a positive opinion of working with West, and though he called West demanding in some ways, he appreciated West's enthusiasm for music and the creativity produced by the recording sessions. The song was recorded around the death of Michael Jackson and the event had an effect of the recording crew of the song, and certain aspects of the song are influences by personal events that affected West throughout the years. In an interview with MTV, West said that the song was going to be last featured on the album, and commented that [...] "emotionally it just fit the crescendo of everything that I was saying and what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to this girl. And it's also my favorite eight bars that I've ever written in my life. I think it's one of the greatest pieces of writing." ...|$|E

As {{she describes the}} process, [...] "He would take my writings and organize them, and he encouraged me to elaborate on certain elements. He emphasized that telling the story is what's important, so he really helped me think about what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and figure out who my audience was." [...] Hill explained {{in an interview that}} writing about past events was easier because she had had time to reflect on them. She wanted to [...] "convey the history and culture of free climbing", specifically how it became as specialized as it is today. She felt that she had a unique perspective to offer, both as someone who climbed at a particular moment in climbing history and as a woman: [...] "And I wonder if a male writer would have presented that information differently. I think the book is important from that stand point , because I am a woman, and there are not many female viewpoints on climbing, or the history of climbing, out there." [...] Writing about climbing in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s was dominated by men. As accomplished American climber and writer Rachel de Silva explains, the six major American climbing magazines published fewer than 12 articles a year by or about women during the 1980s despite women comprising 40% of climbers. It was not until 1990 that the first women-centric climbing books appeared.|$|E

I knew that I could express the things <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> by giving them form through my eyes." [...] Morath applied for an apprenticeship with Simon Guttman, who was then an editor for Picture Post and running the picture-agency Report. When Guttman asked what Morath wanted to photograph, and why, she answered that [...] "after the isolation of Nazism I felt I had found my language in photography." [...] After Morath had spent several months working as Guttman's secretary, she had an opportunity to take photographs. [...] She sold her first photographs - of opening nights, exhibitions, inaugurations, etc. - under the pseudonym [...] "Egni Tharom", her name spelled backwards.|$|E

Sundfør explained this by being [...] "tired of technology": [...] "I wanted to feel like I was a musician again. But also, what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> needed something organic to convey it." [...] She called the album a return to her roots, whereas Ten Love Songs was [...] "more of a detour." [...] Throughout the album, Sundfør's vocals are mostly accompanied only by piano or guitar, with occasional usage of samples and electronic textures which [...] "take the songs into experimental territory," [...] such as [...] "trickling water sounds, wiry bleeps and animal peeps," [...] inspired by Sundfør's travels from North Korea to the Amazon rainforest. Sundfør stated she wanted to [...] "try and mix up some innocent romantic sounds with something very industrial and dry sounds."

Feeling the need to attempt something different, Madonna wanted the sound of her new album to indicate what could be popular in the music world. For lyrical ideas of the title track, she chose topics that until then had been personal meditations never to be shared with the general public; she told SongTalk magazine [...] "In the past I wrote a lot of songs that , but I felt they were too honest or too frightening or too scary and I decided not to record them". She decided to take a more adult, sophisticated approach; thoughtfully, she sifted through her personal journals and diaries, and began considering her options.

She used to take her bullets out of the gun and leave the clip in her room and let me play with her gun. I was an only child so I probably got on her nerves that much that she finally gave me her burner, like, 'Here, get the fuck out my face.' [...] I {{just wanted to say that}} so bad." [...] He also added on how he incorporated one of his neighborhood friends on to the record: [...] " [...] speak on my homeboy Rat Tone. He's one of my big homies from my hood. He showed me my first [...] when I was like 11-years-old. I was amazed by it. I thought that shit was tight. They used to have all the shiny shit. That's how we talked. We would call a gun 'fly.'

It was originally written in 1964 by Brazilian composers Evaldo Gouveia and Jair Amorim as [...] "Que Queres Tu De Mim" [...] for Brazilian singer Altemar Dutra. [...] "Que Lloren" [...] features minor key tonality, bowed strings, a string ensemble and elements of techno music. The song's lyrics show a woman's view of romance and belittles the stereotype that men shouldn't show emotions. The mid-tempo [...] "Sentimientos", {{is a blend of}} reggaetón and bachata music known as bachaton or bachateo, a musical movement in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico which combines bachata melodies and reggaeton style beats, lyrics, rapping, and disc jockeying. It features minor key tonality, mixed acoustic and electric instrumentation, bowed strings, a string ensemble, and ambient synthesizers. Ivy Queen indicated that the song emphasized human connection over material things, stating that [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in the song is that material things have never been important to me.... I look for genuine feelings, honesty, the things that come from the heart, because the material things I can get." [...] In another interview, she identified the song as the one that best represented her at that time, explaining, [...] "if you think you can only conquer me if you're famous, rich and have an expensive car, you're wrong, because I'm a woman who needs affection, someone to open the door for me, to bring me flowers and sing to me." ...|$|E
