5|$|Although the Battle of Pelagonia <b>has</b> <b>frequently</b> been {{described}} as a decisive turning point, Michael VIII Palaiologos' gains were rapidly reversed and his rivals quickly regained their strength, with both the Epirotes and Manfred of Sicily reclaiming most of the territories they had lost.

5|$|Drosera anglica {{was first}} {{described}} by William Hudson in 1778. It <b>has</b> <b>frequently</b> been {{confused with the}} other circumpolar long-leaf Drosera, D. intermedia. This confusion was fueled by the resurfacing of an older name, D. longifolia (described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753), which was regarded as being too ambiguous in description and had been applied to specimens of both D. anglica and D. intermedia. Herbarium specimens were also a mix of the two species. These points led Martin Cheek to propose D. longifolia for rejection as a species name in 1998. The proposal was accepted and the taxon listed as rejected in 1999.|$|E
