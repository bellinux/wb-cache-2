5|$|However, the city's levee {{and flood}} walls {{designed}} and built by the US Army Corps of Engineers breached in over fifty locations. Storm surge breached the levees of the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal ("MR-GO") in approximately 20 places and flooded all of Saint Bernard Parish, the east bank of Plaquemines Parish and the historic Lower Ninth Ward. The major levee breaches in the city included breaches at the 17th Street Canal levee, the London Avenue Canal, and the wide, navigable Inner Harbor Navigation Canal, which left approximately 80% of New Orleans flooded. There were three major breaches at the Industrial Canal; one on the upper side near the junction with MR-GO, and two on the lower side along the Lower Ninth Ward, between Florida Avenue and Claiborne Avenue. The 17th Street Canal levee was breached on the lower (New Orleans West End) side inland from the Old Hammond Highway Bridge, and the London Avenue Canal breached in two places, on the upper side <b>just</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> Robert E. Lee Boulevard, and on the lower side a block in from the Mirabeau Avenue Bridge. Flooding from the breaches put {{the majority of the}} city under water for days, in many places for weeks. Many roads and buildings were damaged by Hurricane Katrina.|$|E

He was active in Warriors community programs during his rookie season, participated in the team's Thanksgiving Food Serving at Patrick David's Cafe in Danville, hosted a halftime Holiday Party for underprivileged children at the Warriors game vs. Memphis on 12/22, attended the Warriors Kids Day celebration, as well as the Run With TMC Fantasy Camp reception, and also visited injured American troops <b>just</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> Iraq at the National Naval Medical Center outside of Washington, D.C., when the team was in the area in early March. His English language skills were poor {{when he came to the}} U.S.; he taught himself to speak English in six months while training in Los Angeles prior to the 2004 NBA Draft. His nickname is Beans.|$|E
25|$|On 3 February the Japanese {{opened a}} series of air attacks on ABDA bases on Java, and the 19th BG was again caught on the ground, losing five of its B-17s in a raid on Singosari, four {{of them on the}} ground. On 20 February, <b>just</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> a mission to bomb the {{invasion}} force at Bali, seven B-17s of the 19th BG were caught on the ground at Pasirian Field in southeastern Java by Zero strafers while re-arming and five more were destroyed. Although 38 of the more capable B-17E Flying Fortresses and a dozen LB-30 Liberators incrementally reinforced both heavy bombardment groups of the FEAF, losses were severe and the slow rate of reinforcement was unable to keep pace. Despite dispersal and elaborate camouflage, a lack of antiaircraft artillery and poor warning/communication systems resulted in the loss of 65 FEAF aircraft on the ground alone.|$|E

Charles is a 25-year-old white man {{from a family of}} bankers, <b>just</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> college and ready to start a family. LeRoi is a young black man in his early 20s from a well-to-do black family and son of a preacher, off for the summer and ready for college. Mary Anne is a young white woman courted by Charles, but who falls in love with LeRoi. When Charles discovers what has happened while he was away at college, he beats Mary Anne and reports to the sheriff that LeRoi beat and raped her. The town forms a lynch mob and the governor is set to attend. Feeling some remorse for what he had brought about, Charles confesses to the sheriff that he had beaten Mary Anne and that she never had been raped. The sheriff, unwilling to cancel due to the visit of the governor, allowed the lynching to proceed anyway.|$|E

[...] "The studio is <b>just</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the holiday and is regrouping based on the news, and has no cohesive game plan at the moment," [...] said Kevin Misher, Universal's President of Production. Misher added that, [...] "It {{was one of those}} moments when you sit down and think, 'Can Clarice be looked upon as James Bond for instance? A character who is replaceable?' Or was Jodie Foster Clarice Starling, and the audience will not accept anyone else?" [...] Foster said in December 1999 that the characterization of Starling in Hannibal had [...] "negative attributes" [...] and [...] "betrayed" [...] the original character.|$|E
500|$|In February 1948, the {{president}} submitted {{a civil rights}} agenda to Congress that proposed creating several federal offices devoted to issues such as voting rights and fair employment practices. This provoked a storm of criticism from southern Democrats in the runup to the national nominating convention, but Truman refused to compromise, saying: [...] "My forebears were Confederates... but my very stomach turned over when I had learned that Negro soldiers, <b>just</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> overseas, were being dumped out of Army trucks in Mississippi and beaten." [...] Tales of the abuse, violence, and persecution suffered by many African-American veterans upon their return from World War II infuriated Truman, and were {{a major factor in}} his decision to issue Executive Order 9981, in July 1948, requiring equal opportunity in the Armed Forces. [...] In the early 1950s after several years of planning, recommendations and revisions between Truman, the Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity and the various branches of the military, the services became racially integrated.|$|E

She changed the lyrics to some of her best-known songs for her French audience and retitled them, [...] "The Naughty Continong"; [...] "Twiggy Vous"; [...] "I'm <b>Just</b> <b>Back</b> <b>from</b> Paris" [...] and [...] "The Coster Honeymoon in Paris".

[...] Talking to a friend years later about her Drury Lane engagements, she admitted that she was [...] "the proudest little woman in the world".|$|E
