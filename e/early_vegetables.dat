60|$|He saw {{no change}} since his last visit to this big, alms-giving, long-suffering {{city of the}} South, the cold weather paradise of the tramps. The levee where his freight-car stood was pimpled with dark bulks of merchandise. The breeze reeked with the well-remembered, sickening smell of the old {{tarpaulins}} that covered bales and barrels. The dun river slipped along among the shipping with an oily gurgle. Far down toward Chalmette {{he could see the}} great bend in the stream, outlined by the row of electric lights. Across the river Algiers lay, a long, irregular blot, made darker by the dawn which lightened the sky beyond. An industrious tug or two, coming for some early sailing ship, gave a few appalling toots, that seemed to be the signal for breaking day. The Italian luggers were creeping nearer their landing, laden with <b>early</b> <b>vegetables</b> and shellfish. A vague roar, subterranean in quality, from dray wheels and street cars, began to make itself heard and felt; and the ferryboats, the Mary Anns of water craft, stirred sullenly to their menial morning tasks.|$|E
60|$|The Hadleigh Colony, {{of which}} Lieut.-Colonel Laurie is the Officer in charge, is an estate of about 3,000 acres which was {{purchased}} by the Salvation Army in the year 1891 {{at a cost of}} about £20 the acre, the land being stiff clay of the usual Essex type. As it has chanced, owing to the amount of building which is going on in the neighbourhood of Southend, and to its proximity to London, that is within forty miles, the investment has proved a very good one. I imagine that if ever it should come to the hammer the Hadleigh Colony would fetch a great deal more than £20 the acre, independently of its cultural improvements. These, of course, are very great. For instance, more than 100 acres are now planted with fruit-trees in full bearing. Also, there are brickfields which are furnished with the best machinery and plant, ranges of tomato and salad houses, and a large French garden where <b>early</b> <b>vegetables</b> are grown for market. A portion of the land, however, still remains in the hands of tenants, with whom the Army does not like to interfere.|$|E
6000|$|No wonder Mr. Jerome {{was tempted}} to linger in the garden, for though the house was pretty and well {{deserved}} its name--'the White House', the tall damask roses that clustered over the porch being thrown into relief by rough stucco of the most brilliant white, yet the garden and orchards were Mr. Jerome's glory, as well they might be; {{and there was nothing}} in which he had a more innocent pride--peace to a good man's memory! all his pride was innocent--than in conducting a hitherto uninitiated visitor over his grounds, and making him in some degree aware of the incomparable advantages possessed by the inhabitants of the White House in the matter of red-streaked apples, russets, northern greens (excellent for baking), swan-egg pears, and <b>early</b> <b>vegetables,</b> to say nothing of flowering 'srubs,' pink hawthorns, lavender bushes more than ever Mrs. Jerome could use, and, in short, a superabundance of everything that a person retired from business could desire to possess himself or to share with his friends. The garden was one of those old-fashioned paradises which hardly exist any longer except as memories of our childhood: no finical separation between flower and kitchen garden there; no monotony of enjoyment for one sense to the exclusion of another; but a charming paradisiacal mingling of all that was pleasant to the eyes and good for food. The rich flower-border running along every walk, with its endless succession of spring flowers, anemones, auriculas, wall-flowers, sweet-williams, campanulas, snapdragons, and tiger-lilies, had its taller beauties, such as moss and Provence roses, varied with espalier apple-trees; the crimson of a carnation was carried out in the lurking crimson of the neighbouring strawberry-beds; you gathered a moss-rose one moment and a bunch of currants the next; you were in a delicious fluctuation between the scent of jasmine and the juice of gooseberries. Then what a high wall at one end, flanked by a summer-house so lofty, that after ascending its long flight of steps you could see perfectly well there was no view worth looking at; what alcoves and garden-seats in all directions; and along one side, what a hedge, tall, and firm, and unbroken, like a green wall! ...|$|E

The main aim {{of the current study}} was to test the hypothesis that early reactions to a vegetable in infants may be associated with sensory processing, in particular, tactile over-responsivity. A secondary aim was to see whether the relationship between sensory over-responsivity and vegetable consumption would be moderated by the age of the infant. A sample of 61 infants was recruited from children's centres and playgroups in South Birmingham, UK. Infant's acceptance of carrot was measured in grams {{during the first week of}} complementary feeding in one testing situation. Mothers filled in self-report measures of infant sensory processing, as well as their own fruit and vegetable consumption. Infant carrot consumption in the first week of solid food consumption was negatively associated with total sensory over-responsivity across different sensory domains (P[*] [*] 0. 05). This study constitutes some of the first evidence to suggest that sensory processing styles be associated with <b>early</b> <b>vegetable</b> acceptance; however, more research is needed to evaluate the best strategies to use when feeding infants who are sensitive to tactile information...|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, some farmers {{cultivated}} the first vegetable gardens, but growing vegetables {{did not become}} common until the early 19th century, when the Napoleonic Wars resulted in the merchant ships staying away. Resident Danes, who brought the tradition of vegetable gardens with them, were usually the first to start growing <b>vegetables.</b> Popular <b>early</b> garden <b>vegetables</b> included hardy varieties of cabbage, turnip, rutabaga, and potato. They were generally prepared in Iceland as boiled accompaniments to meats and fish, and sometimes mashed with butter.|$|R
60|$|The {{first stage}} {{is the change}} from {{inorganic}} to organic, when the <b>earliest</b> <b>vegetable</b> cell, or the living protoplasm out of which it arose, first appeared. This is often imputed to a mere increase of complexity of chemical compounds; but increase of complexity, with consequent instability, even if we admit {{that it may have}} produced protoplasm as a chemical compound, could certainly not have produced living protoplasm--protoplasm which has the power of growth and of reproduction, and of that continuous process of development which has resulted in the marvellous variety and complex organisation of the whole vegetable kingdom. There is in all this something quite beyond and apart from chemical changes, however complex; and it has been well said that the first vegetable cell was a new thing in the world, possessing altogether new powers--that of extracting and fixing carbon from the carbon-dioxide of the atmosphere, that of indefinite reproduction, and, still more marvellous, the power of variation and of reproducing those variations till endless complications of structure and varieties of form have been the result. Here, then, we have indications of a new power at work, which we may term vitality, since it gives to certain forms of matter all those characters and properties which constitute Life.|$|R
