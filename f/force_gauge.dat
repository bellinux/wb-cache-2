The laser distance sensor OADM 20 I 6 X 41 /S 14 F was {{set up on the}} vibration-isolated workstation and its laser beam perpendicularly shoot on the moving stage of the micromanipulator for tracking the displacement change of the skin contact ball in the developed radial pulse sensor, when the digital <b>force</b> <b>gauge</b> is controlled to push/release the contact ball during the calibration. The pushing/releasing process was controlled by a Sutter MPC 385 3 -D micromanipulator (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA, USA) (range: 25, 000 µm, resolution: 1 µm) where the digital <b>force</b> <b>gauge</b> is attached on the micromanipulator. The process can generate 150 -µm height square wave pushing/releasing movement by the program-controlled micromanipulator. Meanwhile, the force information was recorded by the <b>force</b> <b>gauge.</b> In the calibration process, the developed pulse sensor was fixed on the vibration-isolated workstation through a clamping stander. Note that, to meet the real condition that the preload force is applied to the developed sensor during wearing it, an average 1.6 N preload force to the contact ball was initially set by the <b>force</b> <b>gauge</b> FGV- 1 XY before and during the calibration.

50|$|The company {{produces}} {{a wide range}} of weighing products. The present day product line includes industrial scales, moisture analyzers, and <b>force</b> <b>gauges,</b> and newer versions of lab and analytical balances. An up-to-date line of prescription scales and systems is available for pharmacies. Sensitivity ranges from 0.0001g for its analytical balances, 0.001g for its laboratory and prescription scales, and 0.01g for its industrial scales. Capacities range from 50.0g up to 6000.0g for the lab, analytical, prescription and industrial scales. Torbal crane scales and <b>force</b> <b>gauges</b> can go to higher capacities. The company has produced many products thatreceived industry recognition, e.g., magazine ranking or metrology society awards. The most famous was the Model EA-1 which was the first analytical balance to use electronic force substitution. The last three digits of weight were read from a digital Veeder Root dial that was linked to a precision 10 turn potentiometer. The potentiometer output voltage was converted to force coil current which caused a magnet suspended from the weigh beam to apply a linear force to bring the mechanism into a precise balance condition. Also in the balance an E-Core type structure was used to detect the beam position and the result was displayed on an electronic zero center null meter. The first three decades were done with digital weight loading dials. This balance, which was marketed starting in the early 1960s, is still in use in many labs around the country and they appear fairly regularly on e-bay as they are retired.|$|R
