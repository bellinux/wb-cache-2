40|$|Seismic {{observations}} by a three-component STS (Streckeisen Seismometer) seismograph {{were started}} at Syowa Station (69 °S, 39 °E) in 1989. The seismographs have been {{installed in the}} thermal insulation boxes since 1990. Broad-band (BRB) and long-period (LP) seismic signals were recorded on both cassette magnetic tape and long-term chart recorders for monitering. The recording has been contaminated by shift-noise and baseline shift. The shift-noise {{is a kind of}} pulse-like noise which appears on the monitoring record of the (mostly) vertical component. The baseline-shift is an instrumental drift that causes the recording instrument to deviate from the baseline center on the monitoring seismograms. In March 1991,a thermometer was installed in the thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>box</b> of the vertical component for making clear the cause of noises. There was a seasonal change in temperature in the box, ranging from 8 ℃ to as low as- 7 ℃. A total of 591 shift-noises was observed on the seismogram of the vertical component in 1991. During a time when shift-noises occurred more than ten times in a day, the temperature in the thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>box</b> fell suddenly, by 2 - 3 ℃, within a few days. At the same time, the daily mean air temperature decreased 10 ℃ in a day. The shift-noise on the seismograms of the horizontal components were recorded only several times during one year. The occurrence of baseline-shift of the vertical and N-S components were also correlated with temperature change in the thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>box.</b> However, there were no baseline-shifts recorded on the E-W component seismogram through the year.

Both power and communication lines are established with not only conventional wired channels, but also the proposed wireless channels for emergency reserve.

30|$|In {{the trial}} by Eklind (1998), {{composting}} was performed indoors at 25 °C in 125 -L drums, and mixing {{was achieved by}} rotating the drums. Results obtained in our study indicate {{that there was a}} marked drop in temperature when composts were turned on day 3 of composting. Excessive heat losses could have occurred at the time of mixing which entailed emptying the bins, heaping the composting material on a tent sheet before mixing with garden forks. Heat losses could have been exacerbated by the small pile size of composts. Piles started off being just equivalent to 1 m 3 but ended up much smaller as decomposition progressed. In the composting of mixed garden wastes in long windrows, temperatures remained above 50 °C for at least 23 days (Keeling et al. 1995). Where composting of unsorted municipal solid was done utilising perforated 1 -m 3 plastic boxes, it took 8 weeks for the compost temperature to drop to ambient. This seems to suggest that the type of temperature profile obtained in this study may not be explained by the small size of the compost heaps. The extent of perforation or <b>insulation</b> on the <b>boxes</b> could have been such that losses were minimal while this study utilised boxes made from 76 -mm slats separated by 40 mm.

40|$|The {{task for}} this project was to design and {{construct}} a system {{that could be used}} to examine heat transfer through a surface by analyzing images produced using thermal imaging cameras. A long rectangular box made of pinewood was constructed and a light bulb was inserted to provide a heating element. The front face of the box was made to be interchangeable so that various materials could be tested. Two Flir I 5 thermal imaging cameras were used to take pictures of both sides of the front face at specific time intervals in order to determine the temperature distribution of the face. This temperature distribution was related to a heat flux using Fourier’s Law to calculate the heat flux, heat rate, and heat loss through the front face. An algorithm was developed using Matlab software specifically for this apparatus to analyze the data from the cameras.

High rates of both hatching failure (56 %) and nestling mortality (39 %) in the first clutch made this the least successful breeding season since translocation in 2005. Overall 34 % of eggs survived to fledge, compared to 52 % and 58 % in 2005 - 06 and 2006 - 07 respectively. Samples collected from 34 live and 25 dead nestlings were screened for evidence of disease. Bacterial and fungal pathogens were isolated from gastrointestinal swabs {{but there was no}} evidence of coccidia or other intestinal parasites in faecal samples. There was no evidence of significant abnormalities in the blood collected from hihi prior to fledging in the haematological parameters tested, and all blood samples were negative for malarial parasites. Tropical fowl mites (Ornithonyssus bursa) were found on nestlings and recovered from nest material in very small numbers. Sixty percent of nestling mortality occurred during the first 7 days of life, most often caused by starvation (16 %) or poor pulmonary aeration (20 %), and death was associated with seasonally low minimum daily temperatures below 11 oC. Two older nestlings that died suffered from aspergillosis and an unidentified haemoparasite respectively. Seven nestlings (28 %) aged 6 - 19 days died as a consequence of ventriculitis due to traumatic penetration by insect remnants identified as bee or wasp stings (Hymenoptera). The resulting granulomatous lesions were found in the gizzard mucosa, muscle layers and ventricular or intestinal serosa, and were associated with bacterial and/or yeast secondary infection. It was concluded that hihi may lack the evolutionary adaptations to safely consume introduced bees (Apis mellifera) and wasps (Vespula germanica, V. vulgaris) that are attracted to the feeding stations used to support reintroduced hihi populations. Histopathological examination showed candidiasis contributed to the deaths of four nestlings and Candida albicans was isolated from the gastrointestinal swabs of 13 live nestlings from four nest sites, eight of which survived to fledge. The potential of all pathogens may be increased by any cause of temporary or permanent immunosuppression and, in this establishing population, the majority of nestling deaths were associated with environmental conditions (temperature) and ecological factors (introduced prey). It is suggested that ongoing monitoring should include use of temperature data-loggers in hihi nest boxes, health screening of live nestlings, necropsy examination of dead birds, and spore counts to determine environmental levels of Aspergillus. Nest <b>box</b> <b>insulation</b> and/or heating could reduce the incidence of hypothermia in nestlings.

40|$|New Product Development (NPD) is {{important}} for an organization's growth, profitability and competitiveness. The product being developed depends on an organization's unique context and could either be market-driven or technology-driven. Technology-driven product development begins with a new proprietary technology, and the firm then identifies products where the technology can be applied. Models like Technology Stage-GateTM have been suggested for developing new technology-driven products. But this process has the drawback of isolating the technology development process from the product development process. The present project began with the observation that New Zealand had {{an enormous amount of}} Pine wood fibre resource at her disposal, and there was growing research and use of wood fibre reinforced polymer composites worldwide for applications like automotive interior components, decking, furniture, and so on. Development of commercial products with this material was limited to thermoforming, extrusion, and compression moulding process. Although there was limited research initiated into injection moulding of pine wood fibre reinforced polymer composites, there was no documentation of the effect of varying the melt temperature on the mechanical properties of the material. There was also no documentation, either of commercial injection moulded products that have been manufactured with this material, or of the process that could be employed to develop commercial products with the new material. This led to the broad research aim of identifying a commercial product idea that could be manufactured by injection moulding the composite material that was developed using wood fibre and medium density polyethylene powder (rotational moulding grade) and to document the process adopted to achieve this. Some of the objectives were to document the properties of the composite material that was developed without either pelletising, or modifying the properties of the wood fibre by chemical means. The effect of change in fibre content, melt temperature and fibre length were studied. The fibre content ranged from 10 % to 40 % (in steps of 10 %), and the experiments were conducted at four melt temperatures (155 ° to 215 °C, in steps of 20 °C), and for two fibre lengths (up to 4 mm, and between 4 mm and 8 mm). The results of the experiments were statistically analysed using the 'Analysis of Variance' method, for their significance. A new development model, "Technology Driven - Fuzzy Front End" (TD-FFE), was used to manage the "fuzzy" stage of developing the new material, identifying new product ideas, and analysing the product concepts. The model is discussed in detail. Brainstorming technique was adopted to identify new product ideas for the material. The effect of the increase in fibre content on the tensile properties of the composite material was found to be more significant, compared to the effect of melt temperature. The interaction between fibre content and melt temperature on the tensile properties of the composite material was also found to be significant. The results of testing the composite material indicated that addition of wood fibre to the polymer increased the viscosity of the polymer melt. The density of the composite was found to increase with increase in fibre content (up to 40 %). The tensile properties of the material increased steadily with increase in fibre content up to 30 %, after which it decreased. The maximum ultimate tensile strength was found to be about 20 MPa (when moulded at 175 °C). The brainstorming technique was not found to be very suitable for the current project as the number of new product ideas identified were very limited since there were constraints on the material and manufacturing method to be used. Nevertheless, the method identified a building foundation <b>insulation</b> and <b>boxing</b> product. The performance of the product was simulated using COSMOS software and from the results of the static stress analysis, it was concluded that the composite material had the required tensile strength to withstand the pressure exerted by wet concrete. A broad analysis to determine the financial viability of the product was also conducted. It was found that it was cheaper to manufacture the new product than assemble the formwork boxing in the traditional method. It offered additional benefits like improving the insulation of the house, and the feel (or appearance) of the foundation, and also could reduce the construction time of the foundation. It is hence recommended that the product concept be investigated in greater detail by conducting consumer and market research to determine its commercial feasibility, and take it through to production and into the market...|$|R
40|$|Due to high {{installation}} costs and relatively low output, the active use of solar energy is limited. The output from a collector {{can be improved}} e. g. by using a selective absorber, AR-treated cover glass or transparent insulation. The output/cost ratio can also be improved {{by the use of}} reflectors. The performance of a collector depends highly on the incidence angle dependent optical efficiency. In this report, detailed methods for measuring the optical efficiency is developed. In order to evaluate the performance of a collector, measurements are needed. For the evaluations in this work, a dynamic test method has been used. The collector output is modelled as: = h 0 bKta(Q) Ib + h 0 dId – kDT - (mC) e(dTf/dtð) where h 0 is the optical efficiency, I the irradiance, k the heat loss factor, DT the temperature difference between collector and ambient air, and (mC) e the effective collector thermal capacitance. Kta(Q) is a modifier accounting for the dependence of varying incidence angles during the day. It is often modelled as: Kta(Q) = 1 - b 0 (1 /cos(Q) - 1) where b 0 is the “incidence angle modifier coefficient”. In order to evaluate the energy output from different collector types, measurements were made on a number of collector prototypes. In the analysis, the collector parameters were identified by MLR on the measured data. In order to verify the determined parameters, the modelled output was compared with the measured output. The annual energy output was then estimated by using the collector parameters in the simulation program MINSUN. In one study in the work, the incidence angle dependence of the absorptance was investigated by outdoor testing. The tested absorbers had coatings of nickel-pigmented aluminum oxide (Ni-Al 2 O 3), and sputtered nickel/nickel oxide (Ni-NiOx). The results showed that the Ni-Al 2 O 3 absorber has a slightly better performance than the Ni-NiOx absorber at high incidence angles. In another study, detailed comparative tests were made on different glazings in order to study the influence of AR treatment on the collector output. The tests indicated that the AR treatment can increase the annual output by 9 % (at Top = 50 °C). Usually a structured glass is installed with the structures facing the absorber. The evaluation indicates, however, that facing the structure outwards can increase the annual performance by 4 %. A detailed study showed that the b 0 factor generally depends on the incidence angle. MaReCo collectors are studied in the work. This is a reflector collector, specially designed for northern latitudes. The MaReCo principally consists of an asymmetric reflector trough with a single, double-sided selective, absorber that runs along the trough. The purpose of the MaReCo is to replace the collector <b>box,</b> <b>insulation,</b> and some of the absorber material by a reflector. The standard MaReCo has an acceptance angle interval of 20 ° - 65 °, outside which the reflector is not active and the absorber only works with radiation direct from the sun. The MaReCo concept is flexible and can be used for stand-alone as well as building integrated applications. Several MaReCo prototypes have been tested in the work. The estimated yearly energy output at 50 °C from a stand-alone MaReCo with Teflon and from a Roof-MaReCo, both at a tilt of 30 °, were 282 and 336 kWh/m² respectively. The Spring/Fall-MaReCo is a special version that has a low optical efficiency during the summer. In this way, a larger collector area can be installed for increasing the solar fraction of the system without increasing the risk of overheating. The test results estimate a yearly energy output of 222 kWh/m² from this collector. For an asymmetric collector (e. g. the MaReCo), the incidence angle dependence will be different in different directions. The angular analysis then has to be made in two perpendicular planes (longitudinal and transverse) of the collector. In the transverse plane, not only the properties of glass and absorber affect the output, but also the reflectivity and shape of the reflector. In order to handle this, a biaxial incidence angle modifier should be used. One example is the common “product model”: Kta(Q) = KL(QL, 0) KT(0,QT). Shortcomings of this model are that it is not correct for plane collectors and that it is not defined for concentrators where normal incidence is outside the acceptance interval. In this work, a new expression for a biaxial incidence angle modifier is suggested: Kta = fL(Q) gTL(QT). The factor fL(Q) gives information about the influence of the glazing and gTL(QT) accounts for the influence of the reflector. This expression differs in principle from the product model, since QL is not used. In order to study the suggested model, measurements were made on MaReCo collectors. The “no-loss efficiency” was determined by eliminating the effect of heat losses from the measured output. The factor fL(Q) was decided from measurements in the L direction made around the equinox (when QT is constant). The factor FT(QT) was determined from measurements in the T direction for constant QL. In order to keep QL constant, the collector was rotated to a north/south direction. The results were then used to calculate the reflector factor, gTL(QT), as the ratio FT(QT) /fL(QT). The parameters were then used to model the energy output. The analyses indicate that the new suggested biaxial expression can be used to model the collector output for asymmetric collectors where the standard model does not work. One drawback of the method is, however, that it requires measurements to be made around either spring or autumn equinox. The new suggested model has also been tested for modelling the angular performance of PV modules with concentrators...|$|R
