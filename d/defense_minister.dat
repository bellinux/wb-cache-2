5|$|Peng staged {{his first}} {{offensive}} after becoming <b>Defense</b> <b>Minister</b> in January 1955, when he attacked and occupied {{a chain of}} islands, part of Zhejiang, which were still held by the Kuomintang, from which the Nationalists occasionally staged guerrilla raids as far as Shanghai. This operation led the United States to form a defense agreement with Taiwan, effectively preventing the communists from completely defeating the Kuomintang.|$|E

5|$|When Árbenz {{was sworn}} in as <b>defense</b> <b>minister</b> under President Arévalo, he became the first to hold the {{portfolio}} since it had previously been known as the Ministry of War. In the fall of 1947, Árbenz, as <b>defense</b> <b>minister,</b> objected to the deportation of several workers after they had been accused of being communists. Well-known communist José Manuel Fortuny was intrigued by this action and decided to visit him, and found Árbenz to be different from the stereotypical Central American military officer. That first meeting was followed by others until Árbenz invited Fortuny to his house for discussions that usually extended for hours. Like Árbenz, Fortuny was inspired by a fierce nationalism and a burning desire to improve the conditions of the Guatemalan people, and, like Árbenz, he sought answers in Marxist theory. This relationship would strongly influence Árbenz in the future.|$|E

5|$|However, between 28 April-2 May, the Ba'athist-dominated Military Committee {{virtually}} renounced {{the agreement}} when it purged over 50 Nasserist officers from their high-ranking {{positions in the}} armed forces, leading to a wide-scale propaganda campaign by Egypt via radio denouncing the Ba'ath (Nasserist-leaning newspapers had been previously shut down.) Mass pro-union rioting in Aleppo, Damascus, Hama {{and other parts of}} the country followed. The purges prompted the protest resignations of Nasserist officials, including <b>Defense</b> <b>Minister</b> al-Sufi, Deputy Chief of Staff al-Qutayni, and four other Nasserist cabinet members.|$|E
5|$|In 1978 Atrash {{hosted a}} dinner aimed at healing the rift between the ruling Ba'ath governments of Syria and {{neighboring}} Iraq.

Between 2000 and 2006 Atrash {{was a member of}} an organization in support of the Palestinian uprising against Israel.

The security forces soon set up a guard post and a fence around the grove. They then obtain an order to uproot the lemon trees.|$|E

5|$|Árbenz's role as <b>defense</b> <b>minister</b> {{had already}} made him a strong {{candidate}} for the presidency, and his firm support of the government during the 1949 uprising further increased his prestige. In 1950 the economically moderate Partido de Integridad Nacional (PIN) announced that Árbenz would be its presidential candidate in the upcoming election. The announcement was quickly followed by endorsements from most parties on the left, including the influential PAR, {{as well as from}} labor unions. Árbenz carefully chose the PIN as the party to nominate him. Based on the advice of his friends and colleagues, he believed it would make his candidacy appear more moderate. Árbenz himself resigned his position as <b>Defense</b> <b>Minister</b> on February 20 and declared his candidacy for the presidency. Arévalo wrote him an enthusiastic personal letter in response but publicly only reluctantly endorsed him, preferring, it is thought, his friend Víctor Manuel Giordani, who was then Health Minister. It was only the support Árbenz had, and the impossibility of Giordani being elected, that led to Arévalo deciding to support Árbenz.|$|E
5|$|After being {{recalled}} back to China in April 1952, Peng succeeded Zhou {{in managing}} the day-to-day affairs of the Central Military Commission in July 1952; and, {{in the spring of}} 1954, Peng was confirmed as the vice-chairman of the Commission (Mao was its chairman), becoming effectively the most senior military leader in China. On September 24, 1954, the First National People's Congress confirmed Peng's position, and appointed him <b>Defense</b> <b>Minister</b> and one of the ten vice-ministers of the State Council. Lin Biao was senior to Peng on the State Council. Soon after accepting these appointments, on October 1, 1954, Peng produced an ambitious plan for the modernization of the PLA on the model of the Soviet military.|$|E
5|$|Arafat was {{detained}} in Syria's Mezzeh Prison when a Palestinian Syrian Army officer, Yusef Urabi, was killed. Urabi had been chairing {{a meeting to}} ease tensions between Arafat and Palestinian Liberation Front leader Ahmed Jibril, but neither Arafat nor Jibril attended, delegating representatives to attend on their behalf. Urabi was killed during or after the meeting amid disputed circumstances. On the orders of <b>Defense</b> <b>Minister</b> Hafez al-Assad, {{a close friend of}} Urabi, Arafat was subsequently arrested, found guilty by a three-man jury and sentenced to death. However, he and his colleagues were pardoned by President Salah Jadid shortly after the verdict. The incident brought Assad and Arafat to unpleasant terms, which would surface later when Assad became President of Syria.|$|E

5|$|Atrash {{continued}} to hold the office of RCC, and was reelected as speaker on 15 February 1966, shortly before the 1966 Syrian coup d'état (21–23 February), which brought the left-wing neo-Ba'athist government of Jadid to power and caused an internal party split. The Jadid government's coming to power resulted in the self-imposed exile of the leading Ba'ath ideologue Michel Aflaq. Atrash, a partisan of Aflaq, was arrested and jailed in the Mezzeh Prison during the coup. The new <b>defense</b> <b>minister</b> and future president Hafez al-Assad later paid him a visit to discuss Syria's political situation and check on his health.|$|E
5|$|From the outset, Chamarro {{performed}} a delicate balancing act. Her choice {{to lead the}} Assembly, , {{was rejected by the}} UNO vote, which chose Myriam Arguello and Chamorro kept her word not to go against the vote. Her Vice President-elect Virgilio Godoy was in favor of hard-line policies to exclude the Sandinistas, but Chamorro retained Daniel Ortega's brother, Humberto Ortega, as a military leader, granting herself the position of <b>Defense</b> <b>Minister</b> and naming Humberto to second-in-command as the Chief of Staff. For this, Chamorro's critics accused her of supporting the Sandinistas, but it proved to be a valuable political move, as it demonstrated that, {{for the good of the}} nation, she was willing to compromise in ways that fostered reconciliation. She also appointed three FSLN cabinet members, including one for agrarian reform.|$|E

The new UN mission was established as the United Nations Transitional Authority for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES) by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1037 of 15 January 1996.

5|$|In 1992, Russian {{president}} Boris Yeltsin disclosed five top-secret memos {{dating from}} {{a few weeks after}} the downing of KAL007 in 1983. The memos contained Soviet communications (from KGB Chief Viktor Chebrikov and <b>Defense</b> <b>Minister</b> Dmitriy Ustinov to General Secretary Yury Andropov) that indicated that they knew the location of KAL007's wreckage while they were simulating a search and harassing the American Navy; they had found the sought-after cockpit voice recorder on October 20, 1983 (50 days after the incident), and had decided to keep this knowledge secret, the reason being that the tapes could not unequivocally support their firmly held view that KAL007's flight to Soviet territory was a deliberately planned intelligence mission.|$|E
5|$|Marshal Zhukov {{was rewarded}} for his support with full {{membership}} in the Presidium, but Khrushchev feared his popularity and power. In October, the <b>defense</b> <b>minister</b> was sent {{on a tour of}} the Balkans, as Khrushchev arranged a Presidium meeting to dismiss him. Zhukov learned what was happening, and hurried back to Moscow, only to be formally notified of his dismissal. At a Central Committee meeting several weeks later, not a word was said in Zhukov's defense. Khrushchev completed the consolidation of power by arranging for Bulganin's dismissal as premier in favor of himself (Bulganin was appointed to head the Gosbank) and by establishing a USSR Defense Council, led by himself, effectively making him commander in chief. Though Khrushchev was now preeminent, he did not enjoy Stalin's absolute power.|$|E

Two USAF F-16s were dispatched next to attack an artillery piece, but they failed to find their target. Soon thereafter, Bosnian Serb troops seized several Dutch peacekeepers as hostages and threatened to kill them if NATO did not call off its attacks.
