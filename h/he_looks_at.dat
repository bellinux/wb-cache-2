5|$|He {{considers}} the forces such as surface tension acting on cells, and Plateau's experiments on soap films. He illustrates {{the way a}} splash breaks into droplets and compares this to the shapes of Campanularian zoophytes (Hydrozoa). <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the flask-like shapes of single-celled organisms such as species of Vorticella, considering teleological and physical explanations of their having minimal areas; and at the hanging drop shapes of some Foraminifera such as Lagena. He argues that the cells of trypanosomes are similarly shaped by surface tension.|$|E
5|$|Ruby is then {{seen in a}} {{hospital}} bed, with Kevin by her side. When questioned about her experience, {{she says she was}} told by an unnamed group not to say anything. Darlene also refuses to cooperate any further, given the ridicule that she faced after her experiences. Back in Washington, Scully listens to a tape of hypnotic sessions in which Mulder recalls the night his sister vanished. Mulder, meanwhile, sits in a church, crying as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> a picture of his sister.|$|E

5|$|Despite Bowser's demise in {{the first}} level, this does not stop Bowser Jr. from running through the {{remaining}} worlds with Peach in tow, forcing Mario to chase after him before reaching Bowser's castle in world 8. There, Bowser Jr. revives his father's skeleton, creating Dry Bowser, but Mario once again defeats Bowser by dropping him into a deep pit. In the final battle, Bowser Jr. flees once more across a lava chasm to a larger castle, where he throws his father's bones into a cauldron and revives Bowser in his original form. They attack Mario in tandem, but Mario drops the pair into the pit below. In the game's final sequence, Mario rescues Peach, who kisses him on the cheek. Over the end credits, Bowser Jr. is seen dragging his unconscious father across the floor. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the screen, and growls, breaking the fourth wall.|$|E
5|$|Mehldau has {{expressed}} an interest in, and knowledge of, philosophy and literature. In a 2003 interview he commented on romanticism and nostalgia, linking pleasure and pain to musical expression: I love {{the part of the}} Orpheus myth where he is allowed to take his wife out of Hades on the condition that he doesn't look back at her for the trip on the river Styx. When he can't help himself, he looks back, and she is pulled back downstream away from him, taken away forever. Music is that moment right when <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> her: seeing something that you love for an instant being taken away forever. There's an element of folly to the whole thing – you look even though you know you shouldn't. Music kind of yokes together the feeling of attainment and the feeling of loss at the same time.|$|E
5|$|There are two known {{photographs}} of Bahá'u'lláh, both {{taken at the}} same occasion in 1868 {{while he was in}} Adrianople (present-day Edirne). The one where <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the camera was taken for passport purposes and is reproduced in William Miller's book on the Bahá'í Faith. Copies of both pictures are at the Bahá'í World Centre, and one is on display in the International Archives building, where the Bahá'ís view it as part of an organized pilgrimage. Outside of this experience Bahá'ís prefer not to view his photos in public, or even to display any of them in their private homes, and Bahá'í institution strongly suggests to use an image of Bahá'u'lláh's burial shrine instead.|$|E

Whyte, who thinks she is speaking to Daniel, asks him if he is okay, to which he replies he is keen {{to get back to}} work on the Bridge. As <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> himself in the mirror, Daniel sees Leo's reflection looking back at him.|$|E
25|$|After {{being called}} Kid Apocalypse by Kid Omega, Evan begins {{learning}} about Apocalypse and is saddened {{that he himself}} looks like the villain, raising {{the possibility of a}} future that Evan rejects. After saving Angel and discovering that he possesses the ability to see the essence of those he looks upon, Evan asks him to tell him what he sees when <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> him. Angel tells En he sees only goodness inside him, which makes Evan happy, so he thanks Angel for being a good friend. In fact, Angel lied, as the only thing he could see was the dark image of Apocalypse.|$|E
25|$|Thanks to Henry's quick thinking, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> {{the book}} {{to find out how}} to bring them to Clorinda. When Ashley arrived to the stable, she finds an injured Clorinda who was faking it as bait, when Lady Tramaine points the shotgun at her. Clorinda then threatens to shoot Ashley but stops and she learns that Jacob is alive and that they are in his farm. As they are reunited, Lady Tramaine threatens to shoot them but Ashley protects them but is stabbed with Lady Tramaine's {{poisoned}} cane. Emma, Henry and Hook arrived and stopped Lady Tramaine from doing any more damage. With encouragement from Henry, Emma uses her magic to heal Ashley. Later on, Emma asked Hook to move in with her, and he agrees. As part of her punishment for stabbing Ashley, Tramaine is jailed and forced to do clean up detail under Leroy's supervision.|$|E
60|$|He stood quite {{still for}} a moment, listening. Then he glanced sharply around the room. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Mabane, and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Arthur. Finally <b>he</b> {{addressed}} me.|$|R

25|$|In Jared Diamond's {{book review}} on The New York Review of Books, {{he points out}} the narrow focus of the book's theory only on institutions, {{ignoring}} other factors like geography. One major issue of the authors' argument is endogeneity: if good political institutions explain economic growth, then what explains good political institutions in the first place? That is why Diamond lands on his own theory of geographical causes for developmental differences. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> tropical (central Africa and America) vs. temperate areas (North and South Africa and America) and realizes that the differences of wealth of nations are caused by the weather conditions: for example, in tropical areas, diseases {{are more likely to}} develop and agricultural productivity is lower. Diamond's second criticism is that Acemoglu and Robinson seem to only focus on small events in history like the Glorious Revolution in Britain as the critical juncture for political inclusion, while ignoring the prosperity in Western Europe.|$|E
25|$|Hook goes {{calling for}} Emma and {{stands on a}} rooftop to get attention. He jumps off, and Emma uses magic to take him safely to the ground, before asking {{why he was so}} sure she’d save him. He says he was optimistic, and then asks what {{happened}} between them in Camelot. He says he forgives her, but she says that she's the Dark One and forgiveness. Hook says there’s nothing she’s done could be as bad as what he’s done. He shows her a ring that belonged to Barnaby, and whom he killed front of his wife. He says that every ring he wears is a sad story. She shows him the ring he gave her to keep safe, and he says it was the saddest story of all; it belonged to a man better than him, his brother Liam. She tries to give it back but he tells her to keep it. He says he wore rings as trophies and now they’re just reminders. When Emma asks if Hook wants to know the truth, no matter how terrible, Hook says he loves her no matter what, and Emma says she needs to show him something. She takes him to her house and she points him to a telescope. He looks and sees the sea and a full moon over the waves. She says he told her the ocean calmed him and he says it’s a nice home she picked, but Emma says that he picked it, not her. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the newspaper and recognized his handwriting on it. She says he told her this was their future and she says everything she did was to keep that future alive. He asks again for the truth and she says they’re almost there and kisses him. She says she can’t tell him everything because he would try and stop her. After the kiss, Hook gets groggy and asks what she's doing, before passing out.|$|E
25|$|Two years {{previous}} to {{the present}} day events, a rider arrives to the Witch's Hut from Brave, and demands to show themselves and asks for magic. The person, King Fergus, is met by a witch who asks what he wants and he says he needs something to ensure the future of his kingdom and says he will pay the price. She says he can pay her later and calls it an IOU and offers him a contract to sign and he stamps it with his signet ring. She says it’s a deal and she blends up a potion using a pluck of his hair. Later on, Fergus and Merida walking among the clans. Fergus says he’ll take the tongue of the next man who disrespects her. She sees the men writing and thinks they’re sending love notes but Fergus says they’re writing their last will and testaments. Fergus also gave Merida his prized bow that she can carry into her first battle, and Merida thanked her father for keeping her safe. Merida pulls a sword and challenges the man who knocks her down, but the person who defeated her was Mulan, who says she can teach her how to fight better than any man there and will teach her honor as well. Some of the men watching mock her and call Mulan her nursemaid, but tells her no one will follow her out of fear and says to ask her father since they already follow him. Later that day, Merida came looking for him by the water. He says the invaders are sailing in and he’s watching for them. She asks if they will win the war and then says she wants to know how he inspired all these men to follow him into battle. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the helm and she asks if everything is all right. Fergus says you have to show you’re the first one willing to die and says that tells them how important it is. He tells her he’s the Bear King and can face anything. She sees her father with the helm and discovers that Mulan had kept Merida from going with him. When she arrived and sees a knight coming towards Fergus, Merida aims an arrow at the knight, but misses as the knight kills Fergus. The Knight removes his helm, who is then revealed to be Arthur.|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{the four}} behind him, and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the four before him. They all {{returned}} his <b>look.</b> <b>He</b> resumed his way. The four in advance went on, constantly looking back; the {{four in the}} rear came closing up.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> her coldly. Worse, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{her as if}} she {{had been}} an utter stranger. Bulging with her meat and drink, he cut her dead; and, having done so, turned and walked into the next flat.|$|R

500|$|A mutant, who is X-Men's field leader, Cyclops emits {{powerful}} energy blasts {{from his}} eyes, and must wear specially made glasses {{to prevent the}} destruction of anything <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at.</b> Although {{he is in a}} committed relationship with Jean Grey, her Phoenix persona kills him early in the film. Marsden saw no problem in having a smaller role, as the films opted to feature Wolverine as the standpoint character, and feeling that [...] "it's difficult when you have however many new characters that you're trying to introduce to an audience in 90 to 120 minutes, to give everyone their due." ...|$|E

60|$|When {{it came to}} Bella's turn to sign her name, Mr Rokesmith, who was standing, as he had sat, with a hesitating hand {{upon the}} table, <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> her stealthily, but narrowly. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the pretty figure bending down over the paper and saying, 'Where am I to go, pa? Here, in this corner?' <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the {{beautiful}} brown hair, shading the coquettish face; <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the free dash of the signature, which was a bold one for a woman's; and then they <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> one another.|$|R
6000|$|... "Two thousand!"

500|$|In {{the sixth}} chapter, [...] "Written spells and charms", Merrifield {{discusses}} {{the use of}} the written word in magical contexts. Highlighting archaeological examples from the ancient Graeco-Roman world, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> inscriptions on lead tablets that were buried in cemeteries and amphitheatres, both places associated with the dead. Moving on to the use of magic squares, Merrifield highlights various examples of the Sator square in archaeological contexts, before also discussing squares that contained numerical data with astrological significance. He rounds off the chapter with an examination of Post-Medieval curses and charms containing the written word, citing examples that have been found by archaeologists across Britain, hidden inside various parts of buildings. In the seventh chapter, [...] "Charms against witchcraft", he deals with archaeological evidence for a variety of Early Modern and Modern British spells designed to ward off malevolent witchcraft. After briefly discussing the role of holed stone charms, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the evidence for witch bottles, making reference to their relation to beliefs about witches' familiars. Proceeding to focus on 19th- and 20th-century examples, Merrifield discusses the case of James Murrell, an English cunning man, and his involvement with the witch bottle tradition. Merrifield's final chapter, [...] "The ritual of superstition: recognition and potential for study", provides an overview of the entire book, highlighting the evidence of ritual continuity from pre-Christian periods to the present day. Pointing out what he sees as areas of further exploration for archaeologists, he calls for [...] "systematic investigation" [...] of the subject.|$|E
500|$|Cotton's {{response}} to Baillie was The Way of Congregational Churches Cleared published in 1648. [...] This work brings out more personal views of Cotton, particularly {{in regards to}} the Antinomian Controversy. [...] He concedes that neither Congregationalism nor Presbyterianism would become dominant in the domain of the other, but <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> both forms of church polity as being important in countering the heretics. [...] The brief second part of this work was an answer to criticism by Presbyterian ministers Samuel Rutherford and Daniel Cowdrey. [...] Baillie made a further {{response to}} this work in conjunction with [...] Rutherford, and to this Cotton made his final refutation in 1650 in his work Of the Holinesse of Church-members.|$|E

Miranda explains that she didn't know any of that. Colin is later hanging out with Sal. Colin then asks Miranda {{if she wants to}} hang out. Miranda declines saying that her mom is sick. Later on, someone taps on her door which scares her because she doesn't know anyone that knocks like that. She looks though the peep hole [...] and sees Colin.

It certainly did seem that the whelp yielded to this influence. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> his companion sneakingly, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him admiringly, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him boldly, and put up one leg on the sofa.|$|R
