40|$|<b>Tiros</b> <b>satellite</b> {{microwave}} measurements {{together with}} radiosonde data {{are used to}} illustrate a method for deriving vertical temperature distributions in the atmosphere {{on the scale of}} 100 km. The method employs N equations in N unknowns. The unknowns are the N coefficients which are needed at each pressure level to multiply the measured N radiances in order to retrieve the vertical temperature distributions. As an example, the spatial variation of the tropopause characteristics is derived over a cyclone. Diurnal variations in the radiances and the consistency of radiosondes and satellite radiance data need further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Since 1960, when NASA {{launched}} the <b>Tiros</b> <b>satellite</b> {{to study the}} atmosphere of the earth, great advances {{have been made in the}} study of the earth system by means of remote sensing. It is felt that the time has come for assembling the separate pieces into a coherent whole. Work has, therefore, been conducted to develop a concept called 'global habitability'. The objective of the considered program is to investigate long-term physical, chemical, and biological trends and changes in the earth's environment, including its atmosphere, land masses, and oceans. The program is specifically concerned with a study of the effects of natural and human activities on the earth's environment, and with the future effects on biological productivity and habitability of the earth by man and by other species...|$|R
40|$|Ground based {{pyranometer}} {{measurements were}} combined with meteorological {{data from the}} <b>Tiros</b> N <b>satellite</b> in order to estimate clear-sky insolations at five U. S. sites for five weeks {{during the spring of}} 1979. The estimates were used to develop a semi-empirical model of clear-sky insolation for the interpretation of input data from the Tiros Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS). Using only satellite data, the estimated standard errors in the model were about 2 percent. The introduction of ground based data reduced errors to around 1 percent. It is shown that although the errors in the model were reduced by only 1 percent, TOVS data products are still adequate for estimating clear-sky insolation...|$|R
40|$|The {{synoptic}} {{development of}} moisture fields associated with moisture bursts near the ITCZ is described. Dropsonde and <b>satellite</b> (<b>Tiros</b> and GOES) {{data for the}} moisture structure along the winter ITCZ North Pacific are presented and examined. These observations were compared with ECMWF analysis along the ITCZ; consideration is given to relative humidity and burst dynamics. It is observed that the ECMWF analysis reproduces the synoptic variations reasonably well...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} the significant milestones {{in the use}} of satellites for snow and ice monitoring. The feasibility of such monitoring was demonstrated by the <b>Tiros</b> 2 <b>satellite</b> in 1961. Nimbus 1 showed that breaks in the sea ice can be easily monitored during continuous nighttime conditions; Nimbus 3 showed the practicality of delineating regions of active melting of ice and snow in temperate areas. Landsat data {{have been found to be}} particularly useful for monitoring and studying glaciers and their attendant surface features. Ice concentration can be determined with reasonable accuracy from a sequence of electronically scanned microwave radiomenter images made aboard Nimbus 5. In the future we can expect improved sensors and spacecraft systems with longer operating lives...|$|R
40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{is concerned with}} the application of a pressure modulated radiometer (PMR) to the remote sensing of trace amounts of gases in the atmospheres {{as well as to the}} direct measurement of upper atmospheric winds. The PMR operates as a gas correlation spectrometer. Compared to conventional gas correlation parameters, it has some advantages which are related to greater versatility and the employment of a simpler method for maintaining electrical/optical balance. The PMR has a high sensitivity in connection with its essentially very high effective resolution. It represents a passive system and emits no radiation. A PMR is flown on Nimbus 6 which was launched in 1975. The instrument has also been used on the Nimbus 7 <b>satellite</b> and the <b>Tiros</b> N <b>satellite...</b>|$|R
40|$|Benefit-cost {{relationships}} for {{the development}} of meteorological satellites are outlined. The weather forecast capabilities of the various weather <b>satellites</b> (<b>Tiros,</b> SEOS, Nimbus) are discussed, and the development of additional satellite systems is examined. A rational approach is development that leads to the establishment of the economic benefits which may result from the utilization of meteorological satellite data. The economic and social impacts of improved weather forecasting for industries and resources management are discussed, and significant weather sensitive industries are listed...|$|R
40|$|Satellite data {{analysis}} tools are developed and implemented for {{the diagnosis of}} atmospheric circulation systems over the tropical Pacific Ocean. The tools include statistical multi-variate procedures, a multi-spectral radiative transfer model, and the global spectral forecast model at NMC. Data include in-situ observations; satellite observations from VAS (moisture, infrared and visible) NOAA polar orbiters (including <b>Tiros</b> Operational <b>Satellite</b> System (TOVS) multi-channel sounding data and OLR grids) and scanning multichannel microwave radiometer (SMMR); and European Centre for Medium Weather Forecasts (ECHMWF) analyses. A primary goal is {{a better understanding of}} the relation between synoptic structures of the area, particularly tropical plumes, and the general circulation, especially the Hadley circulation. A second goal is the definition of the quantitative structure and behavior of all Pacific tropical synoptic systems. Finally, strategies are examined for extracting new and additional information from existing satellite observations. Although moisture structure is emphasized, thermal patterns are also analyzed. Both horizontal and vertical structures are studied and objective quantitative results are emphasized...|$|R
50|$|The Star {{was used}} to propel {{most of the other}} upper stages used on the Atlas E/F, however it was also used in its own right on several launches. A Star-17A was used in the launch of the RM-20 {{spacecraft}} on 12 April 1975, giving the rocket a LEO payload of 725 kg, while the Star-37S-ISS {{was used to}} launch nineteen DMSP, NOAA and <b>Tiros</b> weather <b>satellites</b> between 1978 and 1995. With the Star-37 upper stage, the rocket could place 1100 kg into a Sun-synchronous orbit. The RM-20 launch failed due to damage to the first stage, caused by the explosion of residual fuel in the flame trench during launch. Another launch failed due to stage separation occurring at the correct time despite the first stage burn being extended by fifty seconds to resolve an underperformance issue, the end result of which was the upper stage separating and igniting whilst the first stage was still firing.|$|R
40|$|NASA's {{contribution}} to tape recorder technology {{may appear to}} lie in such glamorous devices as the tape recorders of the <b>Tiros</b> and Nimbus <b>satellites</b> which receive signals carrying weather information during an orbit around the earth and then transmit those signals {{back to the ground}} when the satellite is in view of ground stations. These quite important recording devices are, however, only useful as members of a complex hierarchy of devices all of which participate in the ultimate process of obtaining information from NASA's efforts. Their existence and utility is based on the existence of many more prosaic recording devices which {{have been involved in the}} development of such spectacular units...|$|R
40|$|Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) was {{incorporated}} by NASA in the <b>Tiros</b> 8 weather <b>satellite.</b> APT included an advanced satellite camera that immediately transmitted a picture {{as well as}} low cost receiving equipment. When an advanced scanning radiometer was later introduced, ground station display equipment would not readily adjust to the new format until GSFC developed an APT Digital Scan Converter that made them compatible. A NASA Technical Note by Goddard's Vermillion and Kamoski described {{how to build a}} converter. In 1979, Electro-Services, using this technology, built the first microcomputer weather imaging system in the U. S. The company changed its name to Satellite Data Systems, Inc. and now manufactures the WeatherFax facsimile display graphics system which converts a personal computer into a weather satellite image acquisition and display workstation. Hardware, antennas, receivers, etc. are also offered. Customers include U. S. Weather Service, schools, military, etc...|$|R
