It {{expressed}} {{the need for}} urgent action by all governments, all health and development workers, and the world community to protect and promote the health of all people. It was the first international declaration underlining the importance of primary health care. The primary health care approach has since then been accepted by member countries of the World Health Organization (WHO) {{as the key to}} achieving the goal of [...] "Health For All" [...] but only in developing countries at first. This applied to all other countries five years later.|$|E

50|$|Primary Health Care {{relates to}} the {{professional}} health care services offered to the community, usually from a nurse or general practitioner. It covers {{a wide range of}} health and preventative services such as supporting and taking care equally for all community, including those who have lower income, provide health education, counseling disease prevention, screening and promoting better living environments. Primary health care became a fundamental concept for World Health Organization {{as a result of the}} Alma Ata Declaration (1978). Since the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Alma-Ata,</b> health situation at country level has gone through major changes. There have been many modifications in demographic profiles, socio-economic environment and reducement of risk exposure and common diseases.Primary health care is available for individuals and families, coming from different municipalities, with affordable costs that can be covered by the Government funds as well as community.Kosovo consists of an overall 36 municipalities, all of which has their own PHC medical centers. Kosovo Primary Health Care is organized in two separate levels such as: Family Medicine Centers (FM) and Ambulatory Health Care Units.Geographically isolated municipalities, have established also some maternities, such as Women Welfare Centers, that serve for women emergency well-being cases.|$|E

40|$|The {{notion of}} health care, and in {{particular}} primary health care, being a public good was strongly expressed in the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Alma-Ata</b> in 1978 [1]. If this position is accepted, the provision of health care should be participatory, assist individuals to remain or become socially and economically productive, promote social justice, and also involve the food, education, employment, and social sectors. It follows that it is fundamentally Government's responsibility to provide the policies and ensure the necessary resources to establish comprehensive national health systems and health-promoting environments regardless of which jurisdictions, sectors, or organisations are providing health services...|$|E

There is no universally accepted {{definition of the term}} primary health care, however the Australian Primary Health Care Research Institute provides a meaningful definition that incorporates both of the above documents [1]. The APHCRI defines primary health care as: Socially appropriate, universally accessible, scientifically sound first level care provided by a suitably trained workforce supported by integrated referral systems and in a way that gives priority to those in most need, maximises community and individual self-reliance and participation and involves collaboration with other sectors.

40|$|Access {{to basic}} health {{services}} was affirmed {{as a fundamental}} human right in the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Alma-Ata</b> in 1978. The model formally adopted for providing healthcare services was primary health care (PHC), which involved universal, community-based preventive and curative services, with substantial community involvement. PHC,did not achieve its goals for several reasons, including the refusal of experts and politicians in developed countries to accept the principle that communities should plan and implement their own heathcare services. Changes in economic philosophy led to the replacement of PHC by Health Sector Reform, based on market forces and the economic benefits of better health. It is time to abandon economic ideology and determine the methods that will provide access to basic healthcare services for all people...|$|E
40|$|M. P. H., Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, 2010 Introduction No {{health care}} {{services}} are available for staff or students on the Potchefstroom Campus of the North-West University. Lack of finances {{and the notion that}} the health of the campus community is not the core business of a university are reasons for not providing some form of health care service. The <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Alma-Ata</b> was adopted internationally, stating that essential health care must be made universally accessible to all people. South Africa endorses the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Alma-Ata</b> and commits itself to ensure equitable access to health care. A needs analysis of the Higher Education AIDS Programme (HEAIDS) demonstrated that most South African universities, within reasonable means, respond to their students' health needs by providing some form of primary health care service. The researcher is adopting an ecological approach using the Healthy Campus Model. The model is based on primary health care principles and values which refer to the health needs of people as this would assist in alleviating the burden of disease and the risks thereof. The Healthy Campus Model also explores equal access and utilization of quality health care whereby these principles of primary health care and community participation would guide such a service. This approach determines whether basic human rights of access to health care have been met. Materials and Methods In this study the research design was a cross-sectional descriptive survey. The survey is part of a comprehensive health needs assessment, using a mainly quantitative questionnaire as a data collection tool. The study population consisted of full-time students enrolled at the Potchefstroom Campus. It included subgroups on gender, seniority and place of residence and was chosen specifically to identify possible high-risk activities and influences on student health. A sample size of 370 students and confidence interval of 95...|$|E

How has health care reform supported or undermined primary health care? What evidence exists {{on the effectiveness of}} primary health care? What strategies are common to best practices? What evidence exists on the roles of citizen participation and intersectoral action? And finally, what are the policy lessons to be learned from these experiences? Narrative synthesis was used to identify and examine patterns in the data consistent with these questions. Conditions that were found to promote successful implementation of primary health care are outlined, together with features of effective primary health care systems that help create more equitable health services and health outcomes...|$|E
40|$|The 30 th {{anniversary of}} the World Health Organization's (WHO) {{official}} certification of smallpox eradication was marked by a slew of events hailing the campaign's dramatic tale of technological and organizational triumph against an ancient scourge. Yet commemorations also serve as moments of critical reflection. This article questions the acclaim showered upon smallpox eradication as the single greatest public health success in history. It examines how and why smallpox eradication and WHO's concurrent social justice-oriented primary health care approach (following from the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Alma-Ata)</b> became competing paradigms. It synthesizes critiques of eradication's shortcomings and debunks some of the myths surrounding the global eradication campaign {{as a public health}} priority and necessity, and as a Cold War victory of cooperation. The article concludes with thoughts on integrating technical and social-political aspects of health within the context of welfare states as the means to achieving widespread and enduring global public health success...|$|E

Methods A review based on published peer-reviewed journals, documents from international organs like the World Health Organization, internet sources and newspapers, which beams a searchlight on the state of health care in Nigeria. Results Results show a lot of decay in the primary health care sector and a lack of proper amalgamation defined by affirmative action of the primary oral health care into the mainstream of primary health care. Conclusion Time for massive action, first by the government, and then by the oral health professionals and the public and all stake-holders to ensure that the dream <b>of</b> <b>Alma-Ata</b> does not remain an illusion in Nigeria's oral health care sector.
