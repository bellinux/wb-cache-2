5000|$|Each Questura had a company-sized {{public order}} duty; also the Regional Inspectorates had {{analogous}} units.

25|$|In the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath,</b> one <b>of</b> {{the most}} {{pressing}} concerns was the inability to distribute sufficient aid {{due to a lack}} of accessible roads and a shortage of available helicopters.

5|$|In the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> Caracalla's death, Adventus was {{selected}} to serve as emperor, but he declined the position due to his old age.

The army proclaimed Macrinus as emperor three days after the death of Caracalla, and named him Augustus.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> the battle, Herodotus {{says that}} the Persian fleet sailed around Cape Sounion to attack Athens directly.

5|$|The castle {{was damaged}} during World War II, but efforts {{to restore the}} castle began in the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> the war. Once again, and thanks to local {{non-profit}} organizations like the Wüstenrot Foundation and Community Fund for the Preservation of Lichtenstein Castle, the walls were restored in 1980, followed by the second floor in 1998. The upper floor and roof were restored in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the market}} {{continued}} to operate, in the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> the plague {{it was at}} a much reduced level and many stalls were left empty for some years after. The famine of 1369 overwhelmed Norwich's burial grounds, necessitating an expansion of St Peter Mancroft's churchyard. The southernmost rows of stalls in the main marketplace, which had been occupied by drapers and linen merchants, were removed to clear space for an enlarged churchyard. By 1377, the population of Norwich had fallen from at least 20,000 before the outbreak to below 6,000.|$|E

5000|$|... "Understanding in a Car Crash" [...] is a {{prime example}} of Thursday's style of emotional, poetic lyrics and {{instrumentation}} paired with intense backup screams, heavy chords, and fierce percussion. It begins quickly with matching snare hits immediately followed by a full ensemble led by a dizzying lead guitar and cymbal-crashing introduction. As the verse begins, a somber lead riff takes over backed a steady beat, crooning bass, and melodic, clean vocals detailing the <b>immediate</b> physical <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> a car wreck. The chorus returns to the introductory heaviness with aggressive, cracked backup vocals, intense drumming, and whirling guitars.|$|R
5|$|During September25–26, {{large-scale}} evacuations {{took place}} in response to forecasts suggesting a landfall near New Orleans. More than 1.5million people in New Orleans were advised to leave the city. The nine shelters opened throughout the area were collectively capable of accommodating up to 450,000 people. New Orleans mayor Marc Morial declared a State of Emergency to allow federal assistance into the affected areas during the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> the hurricane. A curfew was instituted for those who ignored evacuation orders or could not leave the city.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Arthur's widow {{was awarded}} £1m damages in the High Court. The {{families}} {{of the other three}} fatal casualties received damages out of court. A memorial service was held for the victims on the 10th anniversary of the crash in 2010 at St Etheldreda's Church, Hatfield. A second service was held near the crash site afterwards. Both were conducted by the Rector of Hatfield, who had attended to casualties and the bereaved in the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> the accident in 2000.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> the executions, {{there was}} {{speculation}} {{that up to}} 27 more prisoners could face the death penalty. Ultimately, these predictions proved ill-founded. Franco fell ill in late October 1975 and never recovered, dying on 20 November 1975. His death resulted in the de facto abolition of the death penalty, as no further executions took place. Capital punishment was abolished for all civil crimes by the Spanish Constitution of 1978, with sanctioned military executions in war time the sole exceptions. In 1995, the Spanish parliament abolished {{the death penalty in}} all circumstances.|$|E
50|$|Aside {{from its}} {{compassionate}} {{treatment of the}} hibakusha, who were often shunned by their fellow Japanese, this film is remarkable for its terrifying re-creation of the Hiroshima atomic bombing and its <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath.</b> Its scenes <b>of</b> horribly burned survivors of the explosion, their flesh seared or flayed by the heat, struggling to escape from under collapsed buildings or find cooling water in which to immerse themselves, often dying in the streams once they find them, are unforgettable.|$|R

5|$|The defences of Saborsko {{were first}} {{breached}} at noon, and the attacking force reached {{the centre of}} the village at 3:30p.m. According to SAO Krajina sources, resistance was light, with the defending force estimated to consist of only 150 armed troops. The village was secured by 5p.m. with tanks attached to the attacking force withdrawn by 6p.m. The assault resulted in the death of 50 Croatian troops, while the attacking forces suffered only four wounded. In the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> the fighting to control Saborsko, the village was looted and many houses were torched.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Pola, Tegetthoff kept his fleet {{in the northern}} Adriatic, where it patrolled against a possible Italian attack. The Italian ships never came, and on 12 August, the two countries signed the Armistice of Cormons; this ended the fighting {{and led to the}} Treaty of Vienna. Though Austria had defeated Italy at Lissa and on land at the Battle of Custoza, the Austrian army was decisively defeated by Prussia at the Battle of Königgrätz. As a result, Austria, which became Austria-Hungary in the Ausgleich of 1867, was forced to cede the city of Venice to Italy. In the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> the war, the bulk of the Austrian fleet was decommissioned and disarmed.|$|E
5|$|After the attack, {{the bulk}} of the {{civilian}} population and the remaining Croatian police and troops fled over snow-covered terrain in poor weather to Karlovac, Ogulin, and to the nearby territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Approximately 30–60 civilians, largely elderly people, remained in Saborsko. The JNA and SAO Krajina troops forced those who remained behind to leave the village, killing or abusing the civilians. At least 25 civilians were murdered by the troops in the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> the capture of Saborsko. Some of the victims were shot, while others were beaten or burned to death.|$|E
50|$|In the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath,</b> many {{thousands}} <b>of</b> Hungarians were arrested. Eventually, 26,000 {{of these were}} brought before the Hungarian courts, 22,000 were sentenced and imprisoned, 13,000 interned, and 229 executed. Hundreds were also deported to the Soviet Union, many without evidence. Approximately 200,000 fled Hungary as refugees. Former Hungarian Foreign Minister Géza Jeszenszky estimated 350 were executed. Sporadic resistance and strikes by workers' councils continued until mid-1957, causing economic disruption. By 1963, most political prisoners from the 1956 Hungarian revolution had been released.|$|R
5|$|Nonfatal {{health effects}} were {{difficult}} to measure in the smog's <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath.</b> Some <b>of</b> the health effects were themselves delayed; for example, most of the serious effects on the elderly population would only manifest days after initial exposure. A study on the smog's nonfatal health effects was published in December 1966. The study, conducted by a nonprofit health research group, found that 10 percent of the city's population suffered some negative health effects from the smog, including symptoms like stinging eyes, coughing, wheezing, the coughing-up of phlegm, or difficulty breathing. The director of the research group said anything serious enough to adversely affect as much as 10 percent of the population, like the smog had, indicated {{the existence of a}} serious public health problem.|$|R
5|$|In Diane's <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath,</b> one <b>of</b> {{the first}} {{priorities}} in {{response was to}} distribute adequate inoculations for typhoid amongst the widespread areas left without clean drinking water. The United States Army assisted in search and rescue operations using helicopters. After the floods of Hurricane Diane, more than 100,000people fled to shelter or away from their houses. The American Red Cross quickly provided aid to the affected residents, using churches and public buildings to house homeless people. In the {{two weeks after the}} storm, Americans donated about $10million to the Red Cross. The countries of Great Britain, Netherlands, Australia, Canada, France, Austria, and Venezuela offered aid to help the flood victims, sending emergency supplies. Additional flooding affected New England in September and October 1955, although neither was as major as those caused by Hurricane Diane. Following Diane, hundreds of companies affected by the flooding installed waterproof doors and windows to preempt similar disasters in the future.|$|R
5|$|During the {{aftermath}} of the storm, the governor of Nueva Ecija requested then-Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos to declare his province a disaster area. Additionally, UNICEF was asked to provide water-purifying tablets. The Philippine Red Cross, Philippine government, local authorities and civic organizations provided relief assistance in the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> the storm. Despite private appeals for up to $1.4million for reconstruction aid, the Philippine government did not submit a request for international aid. However, by October 25, eight non-government relief agencies provided relief, which totaled $1.15million. Furthermore, the government of Switzerland provided $8,061worth of aid.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his release}} from the {{hospital}} and as a prisoner of war—the exact date is unknown—Schnaufer took over the family wine business. He had never planned to run the family winery as his ambition had always been to pursue an officer's career in the Luftwaffe. However, in the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> World War II the business had virtually ceased to exist and Schnaufer was given the task of rebuilding it from scratch. He had to re-establish business links to suppliers and customers and to consolidate them. Then {{he had to make}} new contacts in order to facilitate expansion and growth of the business. Lastly, he had to create an infrastructure which supported the growth of the business.|$|E
5|$|Howe {{remained}} inactive for {{the next}} half month, not attacking until September 15 when he landed a force at Kip's Bay. The British quickly occupied the city. On September 21, a fire of uncertain origin destroyed a quarter of New York City. In the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> the fire Nathan Hale was executed for spying. Although American troops delivered an unexpected check to the British at Harlem Heights in mid-September, Howe defeated Washington in battle again at White Plains and then again at Fort Washington. Because of these defeats, Washington and the army retreated across New Jersey and into Pennsylvania.|$|E
2500|$|In the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath,</b> Julie Siddiqi <b>of</b> the Islamic Society of Britain {{expressed}} concern that the killing would be used to create ethnic and community divisions. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe condemned the attack and called for a calm and [...] "measured response", adding [...] "we have met with community representatives, and extra officers remain on duty there tonight. Across London our officers are in contact with their communities too." [...] Commander Simon Letchford later noted community concerns following the incident and assured that an investigation was under way. He also appealed for calm and avoidance of speculation. An additional 1,200 police officers were deployed across London to prevent revenge attacks on Muslim communities.|$|R
5000|$|The Stewarts of Ardsheal {{were the}} most {{important}} Cadet family of the Stewarts of Appin. Totally loyal to the Jacobite cause, Stewart of Ardsheal led the regiment raised by the Stewarts of Appin at Culloden. They suffered appalling casualties when breaking the ranks of Barrell’s and Munro’s regiments of foot of the Hanoverian army. However the outcome of Culloden was almost certain before it began. The Jacobite army, tired, hungry, improperly equipped and grossly out numbered were decisively defeated. After their victory the English, led by the Duke of Cumberland, were ordered to execute all the Jacobite wounded and imprisoned. For this he was hereafter known as [...] "The Butcher".Having escaped death both in battle and the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> Stewart <b>of</b> Ardsheal made for his family seat, Ardsheal House, Kentallen Bay. His hope was that if he could evade capture for long enough some sort of amnesty or deal would eventually be struck. Nevertheless none of the Jacobites in this predicament could imagine the determination and ruthlessness of Cumberland.|$|R
500|$|Approximately 100 {{people lived}} {{in the path of}} destruction, located between the CPR tracks and the river. The death toll is uncertain; {{estimates}} range between 70 and 90.

[...] It is possible that the toll may have been higher, since as many as 50 transients had been camped {{at the base of the}} mountain while looking for work.
