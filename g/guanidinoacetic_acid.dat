The second test was similar but used “frozen and thawed” platelets to obtain a quantitative estimate of PF 3 (PF 3 -F time). An abnormal PF 3 -A time was found in approximately three-quarters of 55 patients with renal insufficiency; 43 of these had chronic and 12 had acute renal failure. This abnormality was present both in patients with and without hemorrhagic manifestations, although it was slightly more common in bleeders. The PF 3 -F test was abnormal in approximately one-third of the bleeding patients and one-quarter of the non-bleeders. The PF 3 -A time returned to normal or was significantly shortened 24 - 48 hr after peritoneal or hemodialysis. Studies on patients who were not dialyzed showed no statistically significant correlations between the PF 3 -A time and either the serum urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, or phosphorus. Furthermore, the PF 3 -A time was not affected by guanidinosuccinic or <b>guanidinoacetic</b> <b>acids.</b> We therefore conclude that the demonstrable platelet abnormality in patients with uremia is produced by an unknown dialyzable material...|$|R

BackgroundThe blunted immune response upon stimulation in chronic renal failure (CRF) is often coupled to a baseline inflammatory status which has been related to atherogenesis. Uremic biologic fluids and several specific uremic retention solutes alter cell-mediated immune responses, {{as well as the}} interaction of calcitriol with the immune system. MethodsThe present study evaluated the influence of different guanidino compounds on DNA synthesis, chemiluminescence production, and CD 14 expression of undifferentiated and calcitriol-differentiated HL- 60 cells. In a second setup, these guanidino compounds were evaluated for their specific effect on normal human leukocyte oxidative burst activity and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) expression. ResultsFirst, several guanidino compounds elicited proinflammatory effects on leukocytes. Methylguanidine and guanidine stimulated the proliferation of undifferentiated HL- 60 cells and the antiproliferative effect of calcitriol (P < 0. 05) was neutralized in the presence of methylguanidine (P < 0. 05) and guanidinosuccinic acid (P < 0. 05). The phorbol-myristate-acetate (PMA) -stimulated chemiluminescence production of the calcitriol differentiated HL- 60 cells was enhanced in the presence of guanidine (P < 0. 05). Methylguanidine and <b>guanidinoacetic</b> <b>acid</b> enhanced the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated intracellular production of TNF-α by normal human monocytes (P < 0. 05). Second, several guanidino compounds inhibited the function of leukocytes if they were activated. The PMA-stimulated chemiluminescence production of the calcitriol differentiated HL- 60 cells was inhibited by the presence of methylguanidine (P < 0. 05), <b>guanidinoacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (P < 0. 05) and guanidinosuccinic acid (P < 0. 05). After incubation of whole blood in the presence of methylguanidine, the Esherichia coli stimulated oxidative burst activity of the granulocyte population was significantly inhibited (P < 0. 05). In addition, guanidinosuccinic acid had an inhibitory effect on the LPS-stimulated intracellular production of TNF-α by human monocytes (P < 0. 01).

Plasma amino acid analysis revealed pronounced hyperargininemia and significant alterations in amino acid and guanidino compound metabolism, including increased citrulline and <b>guanidinoacetic</b> <b>acid.</b> Despite no alteration in ornithine levels, concentrations of other amino acids such as proline and the branched-chain amino acids were reduced. In summary, we have generated and characterized an inducible Arg 1 -deficient mouse model exhibiting several pathologic manifestations of hyperargininemia. This model should prove useful for exploring potential treatment options of ARG 1 deficiency...|$|E
40|$|HPLC {{fractions}} of human uremic plasma inhibit the RBC membrane calcium pump. We {{have reported that}} uremic plasma filtrates (UF) inhibit the red blood cell (RBC) membrane calcium pump. The inhibitor was dialyzable, smaller than 3, 000 molecular weight, heat-stable, and protease-resistant. In the present study, we used reverse-phase preparative HPLC, analytical HPLC, and Sephadex G- 25 elution to identify inhibitory fractions. Inhibition was confirmed in three different bioassays: (1) Sr 2 + efflux in intact RBC, the primary bio-assay; (2) 45 Ca efflux in intact RBC; and (3) calcium ATPase activity in isolated RBC membranes. Active fractions were analyzed by mass spectrometry, capillary electrophoresis, enzymatic analysis, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. These demonstrated a number of compounds, including: sugars, polyols, osmolytes like betaine and myoinositol, amino acids, and other metabolites, such as 3 -D-hydroxybutyrate, dimethylgly-cine, trimethylamine-N-oxide, <b>guanidinoacetic</b> <b>acid</b> and glycine. Many individual compounds were then tested for {{an effect on the}} calcium pump. Thus, HPLC was able to separate a substantial number of compounds in inhibitory fractions. Efforts are under way for precise identification of the inhibitor, to advance our understanding of uremic toxicity and/or hypertension in CRF...|$|E
40|$|Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) {{deficiency}} is an {{autosomal recessive}} genetic disorder {{which results in}} global developmental delay and intellectual disability. There is evidence that early treatment prevents intellectual disability and seizures. GAMT deficiency is now being discussed as a potential addition to the U. S. Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP); the availability of suitable screening methods must be considered. A neonatal screening derivatized method to quantify creatine (CRE) and <b>guanidinoacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (GAA) in dried blood spots by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has been described. Its key feature {{is the ability to}} detect CRE and GAA in the same extract generated from neonatal DBS during amino acids (AA) and acylcarnitines (AC) analysis. More laboratories are adopting non-derivatized MS/MS screening methods. We describe an improved, non-derivatized DBS extraction and MS/MS analytical method (AAAC-GAMT) which incorporates quantitation of CRE and GAA into routine analysis of amino acids, acylcarnitines, and succinylacetone. The non-derivatized AAAC-GAMT method performs comparably to the stand-alone GAMT and non-derivatized AAAC screening methods, evidencing its potential suitability for high-throughput GAMT neonatal screening.

40|$|In {{patients}} with guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency several parameters may point towards {{the diagnosis of}} GAMT deficiency. These include the low levels of creatine and creatinine in urine, the high concentration of <b>guanidinoacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (GAA) in urine and the low levels of creatine and creatinine in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In this study, body fluids from 10 GAMT deficient patients were analysed using (1) H NMR spectroscopy. The urine 1 D (1) H NMR spectra of all the patients showed a doublet resonance at 3. 98 ppm (pH 2. 50) derived from GAA present in high concentration. For this compound, a good recovery and good correlation was found between an LC-MS/MS method and (1) H NMR spectroscopy. In CSF NMR spectra of these patients, the singlet resonances of creatine and creatinine (3. 05 and 3. 13 ppm, respectively) were absent (normally always present in (1) H NMR spectra of CSF). Due to overlap by other resonances, the doublet of GAA could not be observed. Our data demonstrate that (1) H NMR spectroscopy of urine and CSF {{can be used to}} diagnose {{patients with}} GAMT deficiency...|$|E
40|$|The guanidino {{compounds}} in various mouse organs after i. p. administration of ferric citrate(Fe) and after inhalation of pure oxygen(O(2)) were studied. <b>Guanidinoacetic</b> <b>acid</b> and N-acetylarginine levels were markedly {{higher in the}} kidney, and they decreased after administration of Fe or inhalation of O(2). Creatinine decreased in the liver after administration of Fe, and it decreased in the liver and muscle after inhalation of O(2). γ-Guanidinobutyric acid level was significantly higher in the normal liver, but decreased after administration of Fe or inhalation of O(2). Arginine(Arg) increased in the kidney and muscle after administration of Fe, while it decreased in the liver. Arg decreased in the kidney and the muscle after inhalation of O(2). Methylguanidine(MG) increased in the brain after administration of Fe or inhalation of O(2). However, MG decreased in the liver after administration of Fe, and also decreased in the liver, kidney and muscle after inhalation of O(2). MG increased only in the brain. This finding suggested that the reactive oxygen species(O(2) (-), H(2) O(2), ・OH) were most effective there, because oxygen consumpution in the brain {{was much more than}} in the other organs...|$|E
40|$|An {{epileptogenic}} cortical {{focus was}} {{induced by the}} topical application of cobalt powder to the sensori-motor cortex, then guanidino compounds in the cobalt focus were analysed by HPLC. An extraordinally high peak was observed in the epileptogenic focus 24 hours after the cobalt application. α-Guanidinoglutaric acid (GGA), which is synthesized from glutamic acid and S-methylisothiourea sulfate, was confirmed by GC/MS as a dimethylpyrimidyl derivative of GGA. An unknown substance was isolated from the cobalt focus and identified as GGA by the same GC/MS technique {{as in the case}} of an authentic sample. GGA was present in the normal cat cortex in amounts of 1 n mol/g. GGA increased after cobalt application, and reached a maximum after 24 hours. The abnormal GGA recovered to the normal level about 40 days after the application by which time the cobalt focus had disappeared. Other guanidino compounds, that is taurocyamine, guanidinosuccinic acid, <b>guanidinoacetic</b> <b>acid,</b> β-guanidinopropionic acid, creatinine, γ-guanidinobutyric acid, arginine, and methylguanidine, except for guanidine tended to decrease in the cobalt focus. Taurocyamine and α-guanidinobutyric acid were still decreased 40 days after the cobalt application. Spike and wave complex was induced after topical application of 0. 2 M GGA to the sensori-motor cortex, and a burst continued for one hour...|$|E
40|$|Deficiency of guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase (GAMT) is {{the first}} {{described}} creatine(CT) deficiency syndrome in man, biochemically characterized by accumulation of <b>guanidinoacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (GAA) and depletion of CT. Patients exhibit severe developmental and muscular problems. We created a mouse model for GAMT deficiency, which exerts biochemical changes comparable with those found in human GAMT-deficient subjects. CT and creatinine (CTN) levels are significantly decreased and GAA is increased in knockout (KO) mice. In patients, other guanidino compounds (GCs) appear to be altered as well, which may {{also contribute to the}} symptomatology. Extensive evaluation of GCs levels in the GAMT mouse model was therefore considered appropriate. Concentrations of 13 GCs in plasma, 24 -h urine, brain and muscle of GAMT mice were measured. We also report on the detailed behavioural characterization of this model for GAMT deficiency. Besides an increase of GAA and a decrease of CT and CTN in plasma, 24 -h urine, brain and muscle of KO mice, we observed a significant increase of other GCs in brain and muscle that was sometimes reflected in plasma and/or urine. KO mice displayed mild cognitive impairment. In general, it could be concluded that the GAMT mouse model is very useful for biochemical research of GAMT deficiency, but shows only a mild cognitive deficitstatus: publishe...|$|E
30|$|The daily Cr {{requirement}} {{for an average}} 70 -kg adult male is approximately 2  g, {{up to half of}} which may be derived by intestinal absorption from dietary sources such as meat, fish and other animal products [16]. The remainder is synthesized de novo from arginine, glycine and methionine by a two-step enzymatic reaction, utilizing arginine:glycine aminotransferase (AGAT) to generate <b>guanidinoacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (GAA) predominantly in the kidney, followed by hepatic methylation of GAA via guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT), using S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as a methyl donor [17]. Cr biosynthesis accounts for ~ 70  % of the total utilization of labile methyl groups in the body, with SAM availability governed by levels of folate, vitamin B 12, vitamin B 2 and one-carbon precursors such as serine, histidine, tryptophan and choline [18, 19]. As such, deficiencies in folic acid and/or vitamin B 12 are proposed to undermine GAA methylation and impact Cr biosynthesis [20]. Dietary and endogenous Cr enters systemic circulation and is actively transported into multiple tissue compartments by a transmembrane Na+ and Cl− -dependent creatine transporter (CrT), encoded by the SLC 6 A 8 gene [21]. Approximately 1.5 – 2.0  % of the total Cr and PCr pool is degraded daily via simple non-enzymatic chemical dehydration to creatinine, which is lost from cells by diffusion and targeted for urinary excretion [22].|$|E
40|$|The {{metabolism}} of guanidino compounds {{was determined}} by analysing the incorporation of (15) N from L-(amidino-(15) N) -arginine ((15) N-ARG) into guanidino compounds. (15) N enrichment of guanidino compounds in the plasma, brain, kidney and liver was determined spectroscopically. (15) N-ARG administered intraperitoneally to mice was rapidly distributed to the plasma, kidney and liver, but was highly diluted by ordinary arginine (ARG) in both the plasma and organs. It {{was found that the}} rate of uptake of (15) N-ARG into the brain was slower than into the kidney or liver, which suggests that ARG could not pass easily through, or was regulated by the blood-brain barrier. It was also found that (15) N-ARG was metabolized mainly to <b>guanidinoacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (GAA) in the kidney and to urea in the liver. It was further suggested that creatine was synthesized actively in the liver from GAA which was synthesized in the kidney, and then creatine was distributed to the plasma and other organs. The (15) N of (15) N-ARG was incorporated significantly into guanidinosuccinic acid (GSA) and methylguanidine (MG), which indicates that ARG is involved in the synthesis of MG and GSA. MG might be synthesized directly from ARG in the liver, because (15) N in MG was significant 1 min after (15) N-ARG administration. (15) N, however, was not incorporated significantly into guanidinopropionic acid and guanidinobutyric acid...|$|E
