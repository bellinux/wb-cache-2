Throughout the last twenty years there has been extensive research on the interactions between the materials and on performance of the geosynthetics including aspects of durability. This research has resulted in significant advances in the design and specification of landfill lining systems. However, to date there has been limited research carried out on in situ landfill lining system behaviour. Measured behaviour from field scale trials and of in service operation can provide valuable information on landfill lining system performance and allow a better understanding of composite material behaviour. Although many numerical modelling programs are applied to evaluate lining system stability and integrity, data to validate these models is currently limited. This paper highlights the data required to validate numerical models and instrumentation techniques that may be used to acquire this information. The paper focuses on geotechnical instrumentation deployed on the side slope lining system at the Milegate Extension Landfill, UK. The <b>instrumented</b> <b>lining</b> system comprises 1. 0 m of compacted clay, a 2 mm double textured high density polyethylene geomembrane, a nonwoven geotextile and a sand cover soil layer. Instrument selection and problems associated with acquiring consistent, reliable and valuable data in a field environment are discussed, as are the challenges and problems that occur when preparing a full scale experiment. Sources of uncertainties within readings are highlighted. Additionally, initial results collected during sand veneer layer placement on the slope are presented. These demonstrate acceptable instrument performance over a 2 year period. Measured behaviour highlights the significance of geomembrane strains driven by temperature changes, generation of post peak strengths at interfaces during fill placement on the side slope due to relative displacement at interfaces between components, and mechanisms of stress redistribution in the geomembrane that result in time dependent changes in strain under constant load and temperature conditions...|$|E

3000|$|... {{pieces of}} quartet {{composed}} by J. S. Bach. Since {{it is difficult}} to obtain multitrack signals where different instruments are recorded in different tracks, we generate audio signals from MIDI files. For each MIDI file, we use the tenor and the alto line for synthesis since we focus on separating two concurrent <b>instrument</b> <b>lines.</b> Audio signals could be generated from MIDI data using MIDI synthesizers. But such signals tend to have stable spectral contents, which are very different from real music recordings. In this study, we use recorded note samples from the RWC music instrument database [17] to synthesize audio signals based on MIDI data. First, each line is {{randomly assigned to one of}} the four instruments: a clarinet, a flute, a violin, and a trumpet. After that, for each note in the line, a note sound sample with the closest average pitch points is selected from the samples of the assigned instrument and used for that note. Details about the synthesis procedure can be found in [11]. Admittedly, the audio signals generated this way are a rough approximation of real recordings. But they show realistic spectral and temporal variations. Different <b>instrument</b> <b>lines</b> are mixed with equal energy. The first 5 -second signal of each piece is used for testing. We detect the pitch contour of each <b>instrument</b> <b>line</b> using Praat [20].|$|R

40|$|By letter dated February 2, 2001, and {{pursuant}} to the provisions specified in 10 CFR 50. 55 a(a) (3) (i), Entergy Nuclear Generation company (ENGC) - Pilgrim requested relief from the Code requirements for examinations of Excess Flow Check Valves (EFCVs). The following information provides additional information in support of that request. The following also changes Pilgrim's commitment concerning the EFCV Sample Test Program method {{to be used for}} trending, and removes 6 valves (relating to 3 high flow instruments) from the relief because further investigation has determined that the associated lines may not have restricting orifices. Amended Relief Requests Numbers RV- 44 and RV- 45 are attached to reflect the changes. Operational Impact The operational impact of an EFCV failing to close following an <b>instrument</b> <b>line</b> rupture would be the environmental effects of a steam release {{in the vicinity of the}} instrument racks. The magnitude of the release of steam through a Pilgrim <b>instrument</b> <b>line</b> has been determined to be within the pressure control capacity of reactor building ventilation systems, and the functional integrity of secondary containment would continue to be met (Pilgrim UFSAR 5. 2. 3. 5. 3). <b>Instrument</b> <b>line</b> "bundles " are routed so as to minimize the potential for accidental damage. Also, the separation of redundant equipment in the Reactor Building is expected to minimize the impact of such a break due to such factors as jet impingement. However, continuously monitored variables such as area radiation or temperature would alert operators to damage and require reactor shutdown and depressurization to limit the release and allow manual isolation of the line (Pilgrim UFSAR 5. 2. 3. 5. 3).

40|$|Analysis of {{ground-based}} Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) {{measurements of}} the solar radiation transmitted through the atmosphere is an established method for deducing total column amounts and vertical distributions of trace gases in the atmosphere. Such measurements contribute valuable information {{to the understanding of}} changes in the earth 2 ̆ 7 s atmosphere. In the analysis of these spectra it is usually assumed that the spectrometer is perfect and that the spectrometer line shape function, also known as the <b>instrument</b> <b>line</b> shape (ILS) function, is ideal. In many cases the ILS function is not ideal and the effects non-ideal ILS on the analysis of spectra has not been firmly established. In this thesis, a Fourier deconvolution method is developed to measure the <b>instrument</b> <b>line</b> shape function. The ILS retrieval technique is validated and compared with a different and independently developed method. The stability of the ILS over time, the transferability of the ILS to different spectral regions, and the constancy of the ILS changes in measurement conditions are investigated. Synthetic spectra are used to investigate the effects of non-ideal <b>instrument</b> <b>line</b> shapes on the analysis of spectra. A few cases are studied in depth and it is demonstrated that using a measured ILS function can improve the retrieved total column amounts and vertical distributions (volume mixing ratio profiles or VMR profiles). Ozone VMR profile retrievals are then performed on measured spectra and the results compared with data obtained by ozone sonde. The result is an improvement in the retrieved ozone VMR profiles, which demonstrates the value of measuring ILS functions and employing them in the analysis of ground-based solar FTIR measurements...|$|R
