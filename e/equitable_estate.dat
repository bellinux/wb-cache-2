5000|$|In Stump v Gaby, Lord St Leonards {{held that}} [...] "when a decree {{is made for}} setting aside a {{conveyance}} it relates back, and the grantee is {{to be treated as}} having been, from the first, a trustee for the grantor, who therefore has an <b>equitable</b> <b>estate,</b> not mere right of suit." ...|$|E
50|$|It {{followed}} that the plaintiff could derive no aid from any act of Congress {{passed since the}} first day of January 1852. On that day, all interest and estate of the heirs of Archibald Gordon in the lands covered by his entry recorded on January 1, 1823, and his survey recorded on November 6, 1824, ceased and determined. The plaintiff therefore has failed to make good her averment that she has an <b>equitable</b> <b>estate</b> in fee simple to the premises in controversy. She has therefore shown no right to the relief prayed by her bill.|$|E
5000|$|A {{jointure}} is of two kinds, {{legal and}} equitable. A legal jointure was first {{authorized by the}} Statute of Uses. Before this statute a husband had no legal seisin in such lands as were vested in another to his [...] "use", but merely an <b>equitable</b> <b>estate.</b> Consequently, it was usual to make settlements on marriage, the most general form being the settlement by deed of an estate {{to the use of}} the husband and wife for their lives in joint tenancy (or [...] "jointure") so that the whole would go to the survivor. Although, strictly speaking, a jointure is a joint estate limited to both husband and wife, in common acceptation the word extends also to a sole estate limited to the wife only.|$|E
40|$|Between 1660 and 1830, Parliament passed {{thousands}} of acts restructuring rights to real and <b>equitable</b> <b>estates.</b> These estate acts enabled {{individuals and families}} to sell, mortgage, lease, exchange, and improve land previously bound by inheritance rules and other legal legacies. The loosening of these legal constraints facilitated the reallocation of land and resources towards higher-value uses.

50|$|The {{lesson that}} can be drawn {{is that if you}} have un-hedgeable {{guarantees}} in a with-profits fund any life company (because the financial market is incomplete) must have built up an Estate (spare money set aside for a rainy day) as the 'rainy day' may arrive (as it did with the collapse of interest rates and annuity rates). But, as Lord Penrose discovered, {{at the time of the}} Hyman judgment, Equitable Life had no <b>Estate</b> - indeed <b>Equitable's</b> <b>Estate</b> was negative i.e. Equitable's liabilities, even with the differential terminal bonus policy (DTBP) being a lawful use of director's discretion, exceeded its assets.|$|R

50|$|In {{the reign}} of Victoria there was a vast mass of {{legislation}} dealing with real estate in almost every conceivable aspect. At the immediate beginning of the reign stands the Wills Act 1837. The transfer of real estate was simplified by the Real Property Act of 1845 and by the Conveyancing Acts of 1881 and 1882. Additional powers of dealing with settled estates were given by the Settled Estates Act 1856, later by the Settled Estates Act 1877, and the Settled Land Act 1882. Succession duty was levied {{for the first time}} on freeholds in 1853. The strictness of the Mortmain Act was relaxed in favour of gifts and sales to public institutions of various kinds, such as schools, parks and museums. The period of limitation was shortened for most purposes from twenty to twelve years by the Real Property Limitation Act 1874. Several acts were passed dealing with the enfranchisement and commutation of copyholds and the preservation of commons and open spaces. The Naturalization Act 1870 enabled aliens to hold and transfer land in England. The Felony Act 1870, abolished forfeiture of real estate on conviction for felony. The Agricultural Holdings Acts 1883 and 1900, and other acts, gave the tenant of a tenancy within the acts a general right to compensation for improvements, substituted a year's notice to quit for the six months' notice previously necessary, enlarged the tenant's right to fixtures, and limited the amount of distress. By the Intestate Estates Act 1884 the law of escheat was extended to incorporeal hereditaments and <b>equitable</b> <b>estates.</b> Among other subjects which have been dealt with by legislation in the 19th century may be mentioned land transfer, registration, mortgage, partition, excambion, fixtures, taking of land in execution, declaration of title and apportionment.|$|R

5000|$|In 1954, Bucksbaum and {{his brother}} Martin {{borrowed}} $1.2 million and built the first shopping center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, anchored by a fourth family grocery store. They expanded into enclosed malls which mirrored the continued movement to the suburbs seen in the 1960s. By 1964, their company - then named General Management - owned five malls anchored by the Younkers department store. In 1972, the company became publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the name General Growth Properties (...) and became the second-largest owner, developer, and manager of regional shopping malls in the country. Bucksbaum served as its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and under his tenure, he formed two Real estate investment trusts and expanded the company's portfolio of malls and shopping centers via more than $36 billion in acquisitions. In 1984, General Growth sold 19 malls for $800 million to <b>Equitable</b> Real <b>Estate,</b> which was deemed the “nation’s largest single asset real estate transaction” to date. In 1995, his brother Martin died and he re-located the company to Chicago. In 2004, General Growth purchased The Rouse Company for $14.2 billion.

Thus far, green buildings do not contribute to net sustainability. While they reduce relative resource consumption, they consume vast quantities of materials, energy and water. i Moreover, they replace land and ecosystems with structures that, at best, ‘mimic’ ecosystems. Elsewhere, the author has proposed a‘sustainability standard’, where development would leave the ecology, as well as society, better off after construction than before. ii To meet this standard, a development would need to add natural and social capital beyond what existed prior to development. Positive DesignTM or Positive DevelopmentTM is that which expands both the ecological base (life support system) and the public <b>estate</b> (<b>equitable</b> access to means of survival).
