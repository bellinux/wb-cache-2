50|$|In the 1990s, {{high-speed}} trains {{began to}} use lighter, lower-maintenance three-phase AC induction motors. The N700 Shinkansen uses a three-level converter to convert 25 kV single-phase AC to 1,520 V AC (via transformer) to 3,000 V DC (via phase-controlled rectifier with thyristor) to a maximum 2,300 V three-phase AC (via a variable voltage, variable <b>frequency</b> <b>inverter</b> using IGBTs with pulse-width modulation) to run the motors. The system works in reverse for regenerative braking.|$|E
50|$|The {{issue of}} {{waveform}} quality {{can be addressed}} in many ways. Capacitors and inductors {{can be used to}} filter the waveform. If the design includes a transformer, filtering {{can be applied to the}} primary or the secondary side of the transformer or to both sides. Low-pass filters are applied to allow the fundamental component of the waveform to pass to the output while limiting the passage of the harmonic components. If the inverter is designed to provide power at a fixed frequency, a resonant filter can be used. For an adjustable <b>frequency</b> <b>inverter,</b> the filter must be tuned to a frequency that is above the maximum fundamental frequency.|$|E
5000|$|Neuhof Substation is a 110 kV {{substation}} in Neuhof, {{an urban}} part of Bad Sachsa, Lower Saxony. The Neuhof substation went in service in 1985 and was {{connected with a}} 110 kV-powerline for three phase alternating current with the Wolkramshausen substation in former East Germany. It was therefore {{one of the few}} substations in former West Germany, into which electricity from GDR was fed. Through the Neuhof substation up to 40 MVA could be imported. Up to 25 MVA of the imported power could be fed via 5 rotary motor-generators, which were manufactured by Siemens and used for the compensation of frequency fluctuations of the East German power grid, into the power grid of West Germany. Additionally power was fed directly from the East German power grid into the grids of Bad Sachsa, Walkenried, Zorge and Wieda. The converters consisted of a three-phase asynchronous motor with a short circuited rotor on the driving side and an asynchronous generator with a slip-ring fed rotor, whereby the frequency adjustment was made by a static <b>frequency</b> <b>inverter,</b> which feeds the rotor. Startup of a converter took place using the slip-ring rotor with a conventional starter circuit. After the converter had reached its nominal speed, the short circuited rotor was connected, which then took over the drive. In April 1990 the plant was shut down and between 2003 and 2005 the machines were dismantled. The machine halls stand still today and are used by Harzenergie for internal purposes.|$|E
