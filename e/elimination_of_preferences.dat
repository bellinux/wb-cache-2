40|$|Abstract. According to Canadian taxfiler data, {{over the}} last thirty years there has been a surge in the income shares of the top 1 %, top 0. 1 % and top 0. 01 % of income recipients, even with {{longitudinal}} smoothing by individual using three- or five-year moving averages. Top shares fell in 2008 and 2009, but only by a fraction of the overall surge. Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario have much more pronounced surges than other provinces. Part of the Canadian surge is likely attributable toU. S. factors, but a comprehensive expla-nation remains elusive. Even so, I draw implications for policies that might achieve some support from across the political spectrum, including the <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> tax <b>preferences</b> that favour those with high incomes, the promotion of shareholder democracy and, to maintain Canada’s relatively high intergenerational mobility, continued wide accessibility to healthcare and education.

40|$|Transracial {{adoption}} {{is a highly}} sensitive topic, evoking intense debate between those who consider transracial placements positive for children and society, and those who consider them injurious to Black children and the Black community. The author explores this debate while asserting {{that the key to}} successful living as a minority person in a discriminating, denigrating society is to have positive affiliations with others like oneself. Thus, to promote and protect a child’s “best interests,” race is an important factor to be considered when evaluating the appropriateness of prospective adoptive parents. The Essay considers whose interests would actually be served if race considerations were completely eliminated from adoptive placement decision-making and what drives the momentum toward this elimination. Additionally, the consequences that would follow the <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> race-matching <b>preferences</b> are discussed as they would relate to Black adoptees, the status and integrity of the Black family, the Black community and American society in general. The author posits that the transracial adoption debate is more about adults seeking to establish a right to parent than it is about meeting the needs of Black children. She, therefore, recommends that professional practitioners and policy makers develop culturally sensitive services and strategies {{to meet the needs of}} the growing number of Black children in foster care...|$|R
40|$|Taxation is an {{essential}} component to raising revenue for the government. Despite public resistance to raising taxes during an economic crisis, taxation has historically been successful in addressing revenue shortfalls. While {{it may be a}} political risk to increase taxes on ordinary income for the average American, there may not be the same societal resistance to modifying or eliminating tax preferences that primarily benefit the wealthiest taxpayers. By modifying or eliminating certain tax preferences, the government can address some of the revenue shortfalls without raising taxes. This article contributes to the scholarly discussion on the modification and <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> tax <b>preferences</b> by demonstrating the connection between the tax preferences associated with, and the overinvestment in, homeownership. In addition, this article demonstrates why limitations should be imposed on: (1) the type of taxpayers that qualify for and receive the benefit of these preferences; and (2) how much taxpayers receive. This article proposes limitations based on both household income with phase-outs and on the number of tax benefits a taxpayer may receive based on homeownership. These housing-based tax preferences cost the government billions of dollars in lost revenue, yet benefit {{only a small percentage of}} the population without a clear impact on the homeownership rates...|$|R
40|$|States {{with income}} taxes {{frequently}} exempt municipal bond interest from state taxation. Such exemptions, {{referred to as}} double exempts, are tax expenditures that reduce state revenues, but are viewed as a subsidy {{to the cost of}} capital for the state and its localities. All but a few states provide the income tax exemption for state based issues while taxing interest from municipal bonds issued by muni issuers in other states. A recent court case, Davis vs. Department of Revenue of Kentucky, declared state statutes limiting the state income tax exemptions to ”in-state” issues unconstitutional. This paper provides some legal background and context for the current case and addresses two key fiscal implications of this case. First, the paper presents a basic model that suggests that bonds issued by states with higher marginal tax rates would see the yields increase on their obligations while states with lower than average marginal tax rates would see their yields decline. The yields would converge at new market equilibrium due to the <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> tax <b>preferences</b> across the states. Second, the preliminary estimates suggest a good deal of variance in how much tax revenue each state will lose if the case is upheld by the Supreme Court. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive {{treatment of the}} cost-of-capital approach for analyzing {{the economic impact of}} tax policy. This approach has provided an intellectual impetus for reforms of capital income taxation in the United States and around the world. The most dramatic example is the Tax Reform Act of 1986 in the United States. In this landmark legislation the income tax base was broadened by wholesale <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> tax <b>preferences</b> for both individuals and corporations. Revenues generated by base broadening were used to finance sharp reductions in tax rates at corporate and individual levels. The cost-of-capital approach presented in this paper shows that important opportunities for tax reform still remain. This approach suggests two avenues for reform. One would retain the income tax base of the existing U. S. tax system, but would equalize tax burdens on all forms of assets as well as average and marginal rates on labor income. <b>Elimination</b> <b>of</b> differences in the tax treatment of all forms of assets would produce gains in efficiency comparable to those from the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Equalization of marginal and average tax rates on labor income would more than double these gains in efficiency. Proposals to replace income by consumption as a tax base were revived in the United States during the 1990 's. The Hall-Rabushka Flat Tax proposal would produce efficiency gains comparable to those from equalizing tax burdens on all forms of assets under the income tax. However, a progressive National Retail Sales Tax, collected on personal consumption expenditures at the retail level, would generate gains in efficiency exceeding those from the Flat Tax by more than 50 percent! Equalizing marginal and average rates of taxation on consumption would double the gains from the Flat Tax. ...|$|R

If this possibility materializes, the primary policy <b>of</b> bankruptcy <b>preference</b> law, equality <b>of</b> distribution among similarly situated creditors, will be severely undercut. The bankruptcy courts should respond by construing the ordinary course requirement strictly so as to avoid extending its protection to preferential payments of long-term loans and other atypical financings.

40|$|The first chapter, "Do Affirmative Action Bans Lower Minority College Enrollment and Attainment? Evidence From Statewide Bans" (forthcoming, Journal of Human Resources, Spring 2012) {{examines}} whether {{minority students}} {{were less likely}} to enroll in a four-year public college or receive a degree following a statewide affirmative action ban. Previous studies of affirmative action focus on drops in the enrollment of under-represented minorities (URMs) at top public institutions after the <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> racial <b>preferences.</b> Using institutional data, I show that the effects of the bans were limited to these large drops at elite public institutions. Furthermore, students displaced from top universities were mostly absorbed by other campuses, resulting in very small drops in the number of minority students enrolling in college. Finally, I provide evidence that fewer black and Hispanic students graduated from four-year public universities after the bans. The second chapter, "Were Minority Students Discouraged From Applying to University of California Campuses After the Affirmative Action Ban?" (with Kate Antonovics), examines college applications. We show that the most highly qualified minority UC applicants were no less likely to apply to Berkeley or UCLA after Proposition 209, despite sharp drops in admissions probability. The middle 50 percent of URMs reduced their application rate to top UC campuses after Proposition 209, but also experienced large drops in admissions probability and shifted applications to less selective UCs. Given these findings, we conclude that there is little evidence of reduced minority interest in the UC system after the removal <b>of</b> racial <b>preferences.</b> In the third and final chapter, "Effort Levels of Minority High School Students Under Affirmative Action: Evidence From Bans in California and Texas"' (with Kate Antonovics and Valerie Ramey), we examine whether minority high school students spent less time investing in human capital after affirmative action bans. To evaluate these possibilities, we use both test scores and other measures of effort and find little evidence that minority students reacted to the bans by decreasing effor...|$|R

40|$|Cocaine blocks uptake by {{neuronal}} {{plasma membrane}} transporters for dopamine (DAT), serotonin (SERT), and norepinephrine (NET). Cocaine reward/reinforcement {{has been linked}} to actions at DAT or to blockade of SERT. However, knockouts of neither DAT, SERT, or NET reduce cocaine reward/reinforcement, leaving substantial uncertainty about cocaine's molecular mechanisms for reward. Conceivably, the molecular bases of cocaine reward might display sufficient redundancy that either DAT or SERT might be able to mediate cocaine reward in the other's absence. To test this hypothesis, we examined double knockout mice with deletions of one or both copies of both the DAT and SERT genes. These mice display viability, weight gain, histologic features, neurochemical parameters, and baseline behavioral features that allow tests of cocaine influences. Mice with even a single wild-type DAT gene copy and no SERT copies retain cocaine reward/reinforcement, as measured by conditioned place-preference testing. However, mice with no DAT and either no or one SERT gene copy display no preference for places where they have previously received cocaine. The serotonin dependence of cocaine reward in DAT knockout mice is thus confirmed by the <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> cocaine place <b>preference</b> in DAT/SERT double knockout mice. These results provide insights into the brain molecular targets necessary for cocaine reward in knockout mice that develop in their absence and suggest novel strategies for anticocaine medication development...|$|R

The subsidy has been implementing to commodity as opposed to households, thus individuals may not necessarily realized that they have been enjoying the subsidy when they buy fuel. In this case people may feel as if they are endowed by the values from the provision of the policy. The <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> the subsidy consequently may be perceived as a loss - as opposed to a foregone gain. This study aims to obtain the most acceptable exit strategy to eliminate the subsidy from the perspective of households by conducting a laboratory-based survey. The alternative exit strategies include methods <b>of</b> <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> the subsidy and of reallocation of resources saved from eliminating the subsidy. The policy options have been derived using insight from behavioral economics ranging from endowment effect, status quo bias, to present biasness. The survey includes 335 subjects, who come from four different backgrounds: 1) households with no motor vehicle; 2) households with only motorcycle(s); (3) households with one car and; 4) households with one luxurious car or more than one car. Each subject faces 55 paired-wise policy alternatives and the method proposed by Dunn-Rankin (1983) has been used to derive the ordering <b>of</b> <b>preferences.</b> The result shows that gradual <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> fuel subsidy and reallocation to earmarked programs were the most acceptable policy elements of the exit strategy. The survey, indirectly, showed that subjects’ valuation of losses is greater for direct elimination strategies than that of the equivalent gradual elimination strategies. The results also show that respondents chose “to pay” later at a smaller amount than “to pay” immediately of the equivalent total value.
