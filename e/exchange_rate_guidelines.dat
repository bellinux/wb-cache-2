It also considers the determinants of the REER {{in connection with the}} choice of exchange regime after unification. The study illustrates how economic policy variables and exogenous shocks affect the real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> primarily through the fiscal balance, and consequently, the savings-investment gap. It further illustrates that the appropriate level of REER and its medium-term path depend upon the mix of monetary, fiscal, and structural policies that underpin the evolution of inflation, balance of payments, and productivity growth. <b>Exchange</b> rates;Exchange <b>rate</b> unification;Real effective <b>exchange</b> rates;Exchange <b>rate</b> regimes;exchange <b>rate,</b> real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> oil exports, reer, real effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> foreign <b>exchange,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, export <b>rate,</b> effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> current account balance, equilibrium <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> system, multiple <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> multiple <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> official <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> markets, exporters, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> policy, oil export, <b>exchange</b> controls, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> systems, nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> developments, average <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> real <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> export performance, dual <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> parallel <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> guarantees, market <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> export sector, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> adjustments, export receipts, <b>exchange</b> restrictions, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> management, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> adjustment, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> import prices, export sales, foreign exchange budget, unification of <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> multiple <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> target, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> index, floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> bilateral <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> export competitiveness, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> depreciation, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> arrangements, currency boards, multiple currency practices, parallel <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> markets, foreign exchange market, capital flight, export prices, capital flows, <b>exchange</b> arrangements, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> dynamics, oil exporting, exchange earnings, surveillance over <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> policies, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> mechanism, currency markets, amount of export, foreign exchange reserves, exports of oil, currency convertibility, export repatriation, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> policies, export sectors, export price index, real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> appreciation, <b>exchange</b> market intervention, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> changes, multiple <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> systems, export ? <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> variations, domestic <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> guarantee, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, <b>exchange</b> transactions, foreign exchange earnings, flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, currency devaluation, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> flexibility, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> misalignment, export price, nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> <b>exchange</b> reserves, foreign <b>exchange</b> transactions, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> losses, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> bands, net exports, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> targets, oil exporter, trade taxes, <b>exchange</b> policy, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> appreciation, <b>exchange</b> brokers, export transactions, oil exporters, flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> exporter, <b>exchange</b> risk, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> level...|$|R

40|$|Consensus {{estimates}} put the half-life of {{deviations from}} purchasing power parity (PPP) at {{about four years}} (Rogoff, 1996). However, conventional least squares estimates of half-lives are biased downward. Accordingly, as a preferred measure of the persistence of real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> shocks, this study uses median-unbiased estimators of the half-life of deviations from parity, which correct for the downward bias of conventional estimators. The paper tests for PPP using real effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> data for 90 developed and developing countries in the post-Bretton Woods period. Support for PPP is found, as the majority of countries experience finite deviations of real <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> from parity.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a monthly database on de facto <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes that covers all IMF members since 1990. Information from IMF country reports and other sources, including <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> data, is utilized to determine de facto <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> policies. Countries are categorized {{based on these}} policies using the IMF nomenclature adopted in 1999. This approach ensures the forward compatibility of the database. The database is then used to examine whether the "bipolar view" of exchange regimes holds with de facto regimes. It is found {{that the proportion of}} countries adopting "intermediate" regimes has indeed been shrinking in favor of greater flexibility or greater fixity, especially for countries more integrated with international markets. Analyses based on Markov chains of regime transitions, however, provide (mixed) evidence against the bipolar view. <b>Exchange</b> rates;exchange <b>rate,</b> intermediate regimes, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, foreign <b>exchange,</b> capital mobility, currency unions, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, de facto <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, currency boards, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> path, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> policy, capital flows, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> policies, classification of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> basket of currencies, multiple alternative <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, capital markets, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> flexibility, alternative <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> stable <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> international capital markets, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> movements, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> stability, <b>exchange</b> restrictions, history of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> data, <b>exchange</b> arrangements, nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> arrangements, real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> markets, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> targets, movements in currency pegs, international capital, exchange markets, intermediate <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, intermediate <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> stable capital inflows, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> mechanism, optimal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, adjustable peg, foreign exchange controls, speculative capital, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> misalignments, currency convertibility, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> anchors, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> exposure, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> behavior, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> target, fluctuations in <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> variations, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> rigidity, foreign <b>exchange</b> transactions, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> rigid <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, intermediate ? regimes, <b>exchange</b> transactions, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> levels, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> rule, fluctuation margins, exchange controls, parallel <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> depreciation...|$|R

The exit from the peg went through several phases, including a series of step devaluations between 2000 and 2002, a first attempt at a float in January 2003, and the successful transition to a unified, flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> system in late- 2004. From 2000 to 2004, the Egyptian pound experienced a cumulative depreciation of 68 percent against the U. S. dollar.
