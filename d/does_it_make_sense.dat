Following the trial, moral critics came to the defense of horror films and rejected calls to ban them. Thomas M. Sipos, for instance, stated,It would be silly, after all, to ban horror films just because Boyer claims to have thought that he was reenacting Halloween II, or to ban cars because Texas housewife Clara Harris intentionally ran down and killed her husband.

40|$|Economists {{recognize}} {{a number of}} criteria for good policy: economic efficiency, equity, administrative simplicity, transparency of the objectives and methods of the program, etc. (Lave, 1981). Thoughtful economists will admit {{that each of these}} criteria are generally important in deciding which policy to choose. However, mo. st economists will either confess or assert that economic efficiency is the first and most important criterion, at least in the sense that a. program should be economically efficient, whatever else its attributes. The reason for the focus on efficiency is simple: Who wants to waste resources? If an objective can be accomplished for lower cost, why pay more? Even if one has no good idea of what one wants to <b>do,</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> to <b>do</b> whatever is to be <b>done</b> efficiently.

Self-evidently, our understanding of any 'past' work depends on contemporary methods of reading; but <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense,</b> therefore, to claim that influence can be retroactive? Harold Bloom used the term 'the anxiety of influence' as the title of a famous study, but his {{is only one of many}} theorizations that span the modern era. This collection of essays examines a variety of texts written in French from the eighteenth century onwards, together with a number of visual and musical works.

50|$|During {{the course}} of {{trimming}} {{the size of the}} chain, the Rosengartens noticed that the remaining stores were mostly located in upper income neighborhoods, such as Manhattan's Upper East Side and in Westchester County. Not only <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> to cater to the higher-income customer, the Rosengartens also recognized that no supermarkets in the area were doing much upscale marketing, leaving the business to smaller shops like Zabar's and Balducci's. From these insights came the idea of the Food Emporium format, which would mix regular and specialty items on the same shelves, rather than following the lead of other supermarkets, which at best offered a small gourmet corner. Elsewhere in the country the concept was already being refined, pioneered by Byerly Foods in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1973. Grand Union was already {{in the process of developing}} specialty supermarkets in the New York market, making Shopwell's decision to launch the Food Emporium format in 1979 a timely one.|$|R

Only when a rule has taken effect <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> {{to say that it}} is as if it had not taken effect.

50|$|Cultural {{consensus}} models do {{not create}} consensus or explain why consensus exists; they simply facilitate the discovery and description of possible consensus. A {{high degree of}} agreement among raters must be present in responses {{in order to use}} consensus theory - only with high agreement <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> to aggregate responses to estimate beliefs of the group. Although there are statistical methods to evaluate whether agreement among raters is greater than chance (Binomial test, Friedman test, or Kendall’s coefficient of concordance), these methods do not provide a best estimate of the “true” answers nor do they estimate competence of the raters. Cultural consensus theory is able to estimate competence from the agreement between subjects and then, answers are estimated by “weighting” individual responses by competence prior to aggregation.|$|E

5000|$|Seeman (1959) {{recognized}} the {{problems inherent in}} defining the [...] "self", while post-modernism in particular has questioned the very possibility of pin-pointing what precisely [...] "self" [...] constitutes. Gergen (1996: 125) argues that: [...] "the traditional view of self versus society is deeply problematic and should {{be replaced by a}} conception of the self as always already immersed in relatedness. On this account, the individual's lament of 'not belonging' is partially a by-product of traditional discourses themselves". If the self is relationally constituted, <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> to speak of [...] "self-estrangement" [...] rather than [...] "social isolation"? Costas and Fleming (2009: 354) suggest that although the concept of self-estrangement [...] "has not weathered postmodern criticisms of essentialism and economic determinism well", the concept still has value if a Lacanian reading of the self is adopted. This can be seen as part of a wider debate on the concept of self between humanism and antihumanism, structuralism and post-structuralism, or nature and nurture.|$|E

The companies that I see coming to the region usually understand this; they have a quite realistic and knowledgeable approach to the region.

We sought to bring the standards we apply to the prime space to the subprime market with our industry partners primarily to expand our services to underserved families.Unfortunately, Fannie Mae-quality, safe loans in the subprime market did not become the standard, and the lending market moved away from us. Borrowers were offered a range of loans that layered teaser rates, interest-only, negative amortization and payment options and low-documentation requirements on top of floating-rate loans.
