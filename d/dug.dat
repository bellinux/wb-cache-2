5|$|A and C Squadrons {{supported}} a costly, abortive 15 July attack on Ruweisat Ridge and the regiment retreated as the division <b>dug</b> {{in at the}} boxes. Two troops were dispatched to join the 18th Battalion on 22 July, encountering an Axis pocket and losing a troop commander. The regiment was incorporated into the New Zealand Divisional box; A and C Squadrons <b>dug</b> in, and B Squadron patrolled south. On 17 and 18 August, A and C Squadrons were relieved by the Buffs and Royal West Kents and moved out.|$|E

5|$|Large parties trimmed the cut stems, {{and left}} them to dry for days or weeks. As well as stems, the rhizomes—extensions of the trunk {{below the surface of}} the ground shaped like {{enormous}} carrots—were also <b>dug</b> up to be cooked. In the early 1840s, Edward Shortland said Māori preferred rhizomes from trees growing in deep rich soil. They <b>dug</b> them in spring or early summer just before the flowering of the plant, when they were at their sweetest. November was the favourite month for preparing kāuru in the South Island.|$|E

5|$|The repentant Carl goes outside, {{only to see}} Russell sailing {{off with}} some {{balloons}} and the propulsive leaf blower to try to rescue Kevin. By throwing out his furniture and keepsakes, Carl manages to lighten the house enough to follow. Russell is captured by Muntz, but Carl manages to board the dirigible, tether the house, and free Russell and Kevin. <b>Dug</b> inadvertently saddles Alpha with his cone of shame and becomes the dogs' new leader. Muntz pursues them around the airship, trapping <b>Dug,</b> Kevin and Russell inside Carl's house. Carl lures Kevin back onto the airship, with <b>Dug</b> and Russell clinging to her back. Muntz leaps after them, but snags his foot on some balloon lines and falls to his death. The house then descends out of sight through the clouds.|$|E

40|$|The cyst {{nematode}} Heterodera schachtii infects roots of Arabidopsis plants and establishes feeding sites called syncytia, {{which are the}} only nutrient source for nematodes. Development of syncytia is accompanied by changes in cell wall structures including the development of cell wall ingrowths. UDP-glucuronic acid is a precursor of several cell wall polysaccharides and can be produced by UDP-glucose dehydrogenase through oxidation of UDP-glucose. Four genes in Arabidopsis encode this enzyme. Promoter::GUS analysis revealed that UGD 2 and UGD 3 were expressed in syncytia as early as 1 dpi while expression of UGD 1 and UGD 4 could only be detected starting at 2 dpi. Infection assays showed no differences between <b>Dugd</b> 1 and <b>Dugd</b> 4 single mutants and wild type plants concerning numbers {{of males and females}} and the size of syncytia and cysts. On single mutants of <b>Dugd</b> 2 and <b>Dugd</b> 3, however, less and smaller females, and smaller syncytia formed compared to wild type plants. The double mutant DDugd 23 had a stronger effect than the single mutants. These data indicate that UGD 2 and UGD 3 but not UGD 1 and UGD 4 are important for syncytium development. We therefore studied the ultrastructure of syncytia in the DDugd 23 double mutant. Syncytia contained an electron translucent cytoplasm with degenerated cellular organelles and numerous small vacuoles instead of the dense cytoplasm as in syncytia developing in wild type roots. Typical cell wall ingrowths were missing in the DDugd 23 double mutant. Therefore we conclude that UGD 2 and UGD 3 are needed for the production of cell wall ingrowths in syncytia and that their lack leads to a reduced hos...|$|R

5|$|Walls {{could be}} {{undermined}} by a sap. A mine {{leading to the}} wall would be <b>dug</b> and once the target had been reached, the wooden supports preventing the tunnel from collapsing would be burned. It would cave in and bring down the structure above. Building a castle on a rock outcrop or surrounding it with a wide, deep moat helped prevent this. A counter-mine could be <b>dug</b> towards the besiegers' tunnel; assuming the two converged, this would result in underground hand-to-hand combat. Mining was so effective that during the siege of Margat in 1285 when the garrison were informed a sap was being <b>dug</b> they surrendered. Battering rams were also used, usually {{in the form of}} a tree trunk given an iron cap. They were used to force open the castle gates, although they were sometimes used against walls with less effect.|$|E

5|$|After {{peace was}} {{achieved}} with France in 1558, military attention shifted towards the Spanish {{threat to the}} increasingly prosperous south-west side of England. Tensions with Spain grew and invasion appeared likely in 1589, resulting in royal permission being given to reuse the stonework from the East Blockhouse for new coastal defences, but this work was not carried out. The fort continued to decay until the 20th century. With {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War in 1939, the East Blockhouse was adapted for use by the British military. The interior was cleared out and a shed was built in one corner. A slit trench was <b>dug</b> {{on the north side of}} the building, a rifle embrasure formed on the east side of the building, and a machine-gun position was <b>dug</b> out and protected with sandbags outside it.|$|E
