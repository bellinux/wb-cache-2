5|$|As work on Nike-X began, {{high-ranking}} {{military and}} civilian officials began to press for Zeus <b>deployment</b> as an interim system {{in spite of the}} known problems. They argued the system could be upgraded in-place as the new technologies became available. McNamara was opposed to early <b>deployment,</b> while Congressman Daniel J. Flood would be a prime force for immediate <b>deployment.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Zeus {{continued}} slowly {{moving towards}} <b>deployment.</b> On 22 September 1961, McNamara approved funding for continued development, and approved initial <b>deployment</b> of a Zeus system protecting twelve selected metropolitan areas. These included Washington/Baltimore, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, Ottawa/Montreal, Boston, San Francisco, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, and Toronto/Buffalo. However, the <b>deployment</b> was later overturned, and in January 1962 only the development funds were released.|$|E

5|$|At this time, the ADF had no {{military}} units on operational <b>deployment</b> outside Australia. In 1987, the ADF {{made its first}} operational <b>deployment</b> as part of Operation Morris Dance, in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters off Fiji {{in response to the}} 1987 Fijian coups d'Ã©tat. While broadly successful, this <b>deployment</b> highlighted the need for the ADF to improve its capability to rapidly respond to unforeseen events.|$|E
5|$|Before the <b>deployment</b> {{there was}} {{controversy}} about the government's non-resolution of repatriation entitlements and peacekeeper coverage under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, {{and it had}} not decided if the <b>deployment</b> would be considered operational service. The pay and allowance issues were resolved; many other conditions-of-service issues were identified, but not resolved. During the <b>deployment</b> few issues were brought to Parliament's attention, although the issue of mail censorship was raised. During the second contingent's rotation, the soldiers' families had a full-time welfare officer tasked with supporting them.|$|E
5|$|Brigade {{headquarters}} {{are scheduled}} to deploy to the Iraq War in fall 2008 to partake in Operation Iraqi Freedom. In July 2008, the 8th MP Brigade began its move into Iraq with a pre-deployment site survey to support the upcoming <b>deployment</b> into the country. The brigade headquarters was set to replace the 18th Military Police Brigade, which ended its <b>deployment</b> in fall of 2008. The 8th MP brigade will continue the training and expansion of the national Iraqi Police force in the Baghdad area. On 2 December, the brigade officially took control from the 18th MP brigade and began its <b>deployment.</b>|$|E

5|$|Colonel Edward N. Hall was {{responsible}} for making the arrangements for the <b>deployment.</b> Two alternative plans were presented to Quarles, now the United States Deputy Secretary of Defense. One was for the United States to shoulder the cost, which would facilitate the fastest possible <b>deployment.</b> The other was for an {{agreement to be reached}} on sharing costs with the British, which would take longer. Quarles shared the plans with Eisenhower and Macmillan in Bermuda, and directed Hall to proceed with the <b>deployment</b> as fast as the first plan, but with the costs of the second. The result was a slower, more costly <b>deployment.</b> A formal agreement was drawn up on 17 December 1957, although {{it was not until the}} end of the month that it was definitely determined that Britain would receive Thor and not Jupiter missiles. The <b>deployment</b> of Thor missiles was codenamed Project Emily.|$|E
5|$|<b>Deployment</b> without weapons: On {{a number}} of occasions, {{soldiers}} were asked to deploy without weapons by UNTAG civilian officials. Early in the <b>deployment</b> Lieutenants Burchell and Stanner were asked by UNHCR to conduct an unarmed reconnaissance, but permission was refused. Near the election, Australian military electoral monitors were asked to deploy in civilian clothes without weapons.|$|E
5|$|During August 2016, it was {{announced}} that 650 soldiers of the British Army would be deployed on an enduring basis in Eastern Europe, mainly in Estonia with some also being deployed to Poland. This British <b>deployment</b> forms part of a four-battle group (four-battalion) <b>deployment</b> by various allies, NATO Enhanced Forward Presence, one each spread from Poland (the Poland-deployed battle group mostly led by the U.S.) to Estonia.|$|E

5|$|From 1912, Godley began putting {{plans in}} place for the rapid <b>deployment</b> of a New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) in the event of war in Europe. He {{anticipated}} that Imperial Germany would be the likely enemy and envisaged <b>deployment</b> to either Europe or possibly Egypt, to counter the likely threat to the Suez Canal in the event Turkey aligned itself with Germany. He envisioned the expected <b>deployment</b> would be co-ordinated with an Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and liaised with the Australian Chief of General Staff, Brigadier General Joseph Gordon, and the possibility of a composite division was discussed. The question of Germany's possessions in the South Pacific was also raised, and it was agreed that New Zealand would have responsibility for German Samoa, while Australia dealt with German New Guinea. The arrangements Godley put {{in place for}} <b>deployment</b> for the NZEF were soon put to the test, for when the First World War began, a New Zealand occupation force was quickly assembled to occupy German Samoa.|$|E

5|$|Further work {{along these}} lines led to the Nike-X <b>Deployment</b> Study, or DEPEX. DEPEX {{outlined}} a <b>deployment</b> that started out very similar to Nth Country, with a few bases primarily using Nike EX to provide lightweight cover, but which also included design features that allowed more bases to be added as {{the nature of the}} threat changed. The study described a four-phase <b>deployment</b> sequence that added more and more terminal defenses as the sophistication of the Nth Country missiles increased over time.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, five Merlin Mk3s were {{operating}} in Afghanistan, transporting troops and supplies. The <b>deployment</b> to Afghanistan was criticised as the aircraft reportedly lacked protective Kevlar armour. By July 2010, the Merlin fleet was fully fitted with ballistic armour. The <b>deployment</b> of Merlins to Afghanistan allowed the detachment of Sea Kings {{to be withdrawn}} from the region in October 2011. As part of the UK drawdown in Afghanistan, Merlins were withdrawn from theatre in June 2013.|$|E

5|$|In {{line with}} this goal, the ADF was {{restructured}} {{to increase its}} ability to strike at enemy forces from Australian bases and to counter raids on continental Australia. This was achieved by increasing {{the capabilities of the}} RAN and RAAF, and relocating regular Army units to Northern Australia. During this time the ADF had no military units on operational <b>deployment</b> outside Australia. However, in 1987 the ADF made its first operational <b>deployment</b> as part of Operation Morris Dance, in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters off Fiji in response to the 1987 Fijian coups d'Ã©tat.

5|$|NATO had decided, {{under the}} impetus of the Reagan administration, to deploy Pershing II and cruise {{missiles}} in West Germany.

At the end of the Temporary Duty (TDY), they were relieved by another SAC wing that was generally stationed at a different airfield. These <b>deployments</b> continued until 1955 when SAC shifted its rotational <b>deployments</b> to RAF Fairford and Manston was turned over to the United States Air Forces in Europe.|$|R
