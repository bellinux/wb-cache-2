50|$|Sediment yield is {{the total}} {{quantity}} of particulate matter (suspended or bedload) reaching the outlet of a drainage basin over a fixed time frame. Yield is usually expressed as kilograms per square kilometre per year. Sediment delivery processes are affected by a myriad of factors such as drainage area size, basin slope, climate, sediment type (lithology), vegetation cover, and human land use / management practices. The theoretical concept of the 'sediment delivery ratio' (ratio between yield and total amount of sediment eroded) captures {{the fact that not}} all of the sediment is eroded within a certain catchment that reaches out to the outlet (due to, for example, deposition on floodplains). Such storage opportunities are typically increased in catchments of larger size, thus leading to a lower yield and sediment <b>delivery</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|E

We use link duration as our mobility feedback metric, and we demonstrate that mobility feedback using link duration effectively enables adaptive MANET protocols. Using our mobility feedback agent, we develop a hybrid MANET routing protocol which adapts between two MANET routing protocols in order to combine the strengths of both component protocols while avoiding their weaknesses. Our hybrid, adaptive protocol achieves data packet <b>delivery</b> <b>ratios</b> above 80 % in VERY demanding network mobility conditions (i. e. link durations less than 4 seconds). In more stable networks (i. e., link durations more than 15 seconds), our protocol achieves data packet <b>delivery</b> <b>ratios</b> above 90 %.

5000|$|In medicine, {{nitroglycerin}} {{is used as}} {{a medicine}} for angina pectoris, a painful symptom of ischemic heart disease caused by inadequate flow of blood and oxygen to the heart and as a potent antihypertensive agent. Nitroglycerin corrects the imbalance between the flow of oxygen and blood to the heart. [...] At low doses, nitroglycerin will dilate veins more than arteries, thereby reducing preload (volume of blood in the heart after filling); this is thought to be its primary mechanism of action. By decreasing preload, the heart has less blood to pump which decreases oxygen requirement since the heart doesn't have to work as hard. Additionally, having a smaller preload reduces the ventricular transmural pressure (pressure exerted {{on the walls of the}} heart), which decreases the compression of heart arteries to allow more blood to flow through the heart. At higher doses, it also dilates arteries, thereby reducing afterload (decreasing the pressure against which the heart must pump). Improved myocardial oxygen demand vs oxygen <b>delivery</b> <b>ratio</b> leads to the following therapeutic effects during episodes of angina pectoris: subsiding of chest pain, decrease of blood pressure, increase of heart rate, and orthostatic hypotension. Patients experiencing angina when doing certain physical activities can often prevent symptoms by taking nitroglycerin 5 to 10 minutes before the activity.|$|E

40|$|The {{assertion}} that {{the application of the}} USLE to predicting soil losses within a catchment or watershed is not sound because the USLE provides an estimate of erosion that would be measured if the entire area were divided up into 22 · 1 m long plots, and the output from them all added together, is incorrect. The slope length factor was derived from data obtained using a wide range of plot lengths and included the 22 · 1 m length simply to force it to take on a value of 1 · 0 when the slope length is 22 · 1 m. The 22 · 1 m length has no physical significance but the USLE slope length factor has a physical basis when applied to planar and convex hillslopes. The use of sediment <b>delivery</b> <b>ratios</b> when the USLE is applied to concave areas attempts to correct for applying the USLE beyond its design criteria.

40|$|Abstract: Erosion and {{sediment}} yield data was evaluated from the Dahhe Watershed, an important branch of Yellow River. It {{was concluded that}} long-term erosion {{and sediment}} yield in the watershed system reached balance, and the sediment <b>delivery</b> <b>ratio</b> was approximate equal to I. However, {{as a result of}} short-term temporal variability from different rainfall events and annual rainfall trends, the sediment <b>delivery</b> <b>ratio</b> can reach more than 1 or less than 1 because the sediment transport in the watershed can be delayed or transported in subsequent by runoff erosion events. The sediment <b>delivery</b> <b>ratio</b> is closely correlated with runoff depth ratio, rainfall distribution, and the flood peak amplitude ratio in the watershed system. The spatial and temporal characteristics of the <b>delivery</b> <b>ratio</b> in watersheds at various scales and the factors that influence <b>delivery</b> <b>ratio</b> in the watershed systems are presented here.

As shown in this graph, the <b>delivery</b> <b>ratio</b> is 100 % and deteriorates for two, three and four flows.

40|$|A {{number of}} switch fabric {{architectures}} based on mini-router grids (MRG) {{have been proposed}} as a replacement of buses for system-on-chip communication, {{as well as a}} replacement of crossbars for network routers. The rationale for using MRGs in switch fabrics is that they provide high <b>delivery</b> <b>ratios,</b> low latencies, high degree of parallelism and pipelining, load balancing properties, and sub-quadratic cost growth for their implementation. The traditional approaches to switch fabrics are based on input queuing (IQ) or virtual output queueing (VOQ), because output queuing (OQ) solutions to date are unscalable and expensive due to the speedup problem. However, we show that the speedup problem introduced by OQ can be bounded by 3 by using MRGs. We present the design of a switch fabric based on OQ MRGs that offers high <b>delivery</b> <b>ratios,</b> smaller queue sizes, and QoS guarantees. Queueing and scheduling are distributed over the MRs, where each MR is a pipestage, thus allowing MRGs to provide high throughput by nature.
