Access to schooling was expanded in coastal areas during the colonial period, with French language and basic work skills becoming the <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curriculum. During the post-colonial First Republic, a continued reliance on French nationals as teachers, and French as the language of instruction, displeased those desiring a complete separation from the former colonial power.|$|E
5|$|Chapter 7 {{discusses}} the fifth limb of yoga, Pratyahara, which {{it says is}} of five forms. This stage is one where the <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mind shifts from external stimuli received by sensory organs to various levels of internal awareness.

40|$|<b>The</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{collapse}} {{energy is}} well established for <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> collective collapse of cloud cavitation. It has been indicated however that erosion can also be generated by cavities that stay glassy until a very late stage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collapse, a circumstance implying that <b>focusing</b> <b>of</b> energy should be analyzed also {{for this type of}} cavities. In this study, <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collapse energy has been applied in practical observations as a procedure for analysis of erosive cavities. From some experiments, it was found that glassy cavities can, as focusing cavities, be closely related to <b>the</b> generation <b>of</b> severe erosion. A simplified cascading process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>of</b> collapse energy is also assumed for the glassy cavity. Furthermore, erosion tests results showed that any type <b>of</b> fluctuations in <b>the</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collapse energy lead to a decrease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collapse pressure and thus a decrease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> erosion...|$|R
