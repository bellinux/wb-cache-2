5|$|Shepard {{attended}} Adams School in Derry, {{where his}} academic performance impressed his teachers; he skipped the sixth grade, {{and proceeded to}} middle school at Oak Street School in Derry, where he skipped the eighth grade. In 1936, {{he went to the}} Pinkerton Academy, a private school in Derry that his father had attended, and where his grandfather had been a trustee. He completed years 9 to 12 there. Fascinated by flight, he created a model airplane club at the Academy, and his Christmas present in 1938 was a flight in a Douglas DC-3. The following year he began cycling to Manchester Airfield, where he would <b>do</b> <b>odd</b> <b>jobs</b> in exchange for the occasional ride in an airplane or informal flying lesson.|$|E
25|$|As penance, Thao's mother {{makes him}} work for Walt, who has him <b>do</b> <b>odd</b> <b>jobs</b> around the neighborhood, {{and the two}} form a grudging mutual respect. Thao's sister Sue (Ahney Her) {{introduces}} Walt to Hmong culture and helps him bond with the Hmong community, who soon become more like family to Walt than his actual family and he, in turn, becomes a better man to them than he was to his own sons. Walt helps Thao {{get a job and}} gives him dating advice. Walt eventually visits a doctor regarding his coughing fits, where it is implied that he does not have long to live.|$|E
500|$|On September 17, 1846, Josephite Malo-Galipeau {{joined the}} community, {{bringing}} {{with her a}} large endowment of funds left to her by her late husband, which substantially enriched the community. Despite these additional funds {{the women of the}} Hospice were still forced to <b>do</b> <b>odd</b> <b>jobs</b> outside the hospice to make ends meet. Cadron-Jetté during this time undertook occasional work as a shoemaker. [...] Elections were held within the community on November 6, 1846, with the result of Cadron-Jetté being appointed as the new superior for a period of one year, with Malo-Galipeau named as her assistant. From December 1, 1846, the women of the community began wearing a religious habit at the direction of Bishop Prince.|$|E

2500|$|A young intern, {{he works}} very hard {{but does not}} always get proper recognition. Asok is {{intensely}} intelligent but naive about corporate life; the shattering of his optimistic illusions becomes frequent comic fodder. He is Indian, and has graduated from the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT). The other workers, especially the boss, often unwittingly trample on his cultural beliefs. [...] On the occasions when Asok mentions this, he is normally ignored. His test scores (a perfect 1600 on the old SAT) and his IQ of 240 show {{that he is the}} smartest member of the engineering team. Nonetheless he is often called upon by the Boss to <b>do</b> <b>odd</b> <b>jobs,</b> and in meetings his ideas are usually left hanging. He is also seen regularly at the lunch table with Wally and Dilbert, experiencing jarring realizations of the nature of corporate life. There are a few jokes about his psychic powers, which he learned at the IIT. Yet despite his intelligence, ethics and mystical powers, Asok sometimes takes advice from Wally in the arts of laziness, and from Dilbert in surviving the office. As of February 7, 2014, Asok is officially gay, which never impacts any storylines but merely commemorates a decision by the Indian Supreme Court to uphold an anti-gay law.|$|E
60|$|As for the poor, {{they seemed}} to have utterly disappeared. All those who had {{depended}} upon charity for their daily bread were now at work in some way or other; many of them offering to <b>do</b> <b>odd</b> <b>jobs</b> for their neighbors {{just for the sake of}} their meals,--a thing which before had been seldom heard of in the town. The Griffin could find no one who needed his assistance.|$|E

60|$|Lady Wetherby {{turned on}} him with some violence. His {{detached}} attitude was the most irritating of the many irritating aspects of the situation. She paid this man a weekly wage to <b>do</b> <b>odd</b> <b>jobs.</b> The capture of Eustace was essentially an odd job. Yet, instead of doing it, he hung about with the air of one who has paid his half-dollar and bought his bag of peanuts and has now {{nothing to do but}} look on and enjoy himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "We've {{got a job}} for you up at headquarters. You'll {{be called}} on to sweep floors, wash windows, build fires, and <b>do</b> <b>odd</b> <b>jobs</b> generally; {{but at the same}} time you'll be in what's called the general school of instruction--where the men who want to get into the Department are put on probation, so to speak. It's been promised us who run with Ninety-four, that if you behave {{yourself}} you shall have a chance to learn the drill, and once that has been done, Amateur, you'll be in shape to join us as soon's you've got size to your body." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{event was}} the {{concrete}} result of Winterborne's thoughts {{during the past}} week or two. The want of success with his evening party he had accepted in as philosophic a mood as he was capable of; {{but there had been}} enthusiasm enough left in him one day at Sherton Abbas market to purchase this old mare, which had belonged to a neighboring parson with several daughters, and was offered him to carry either a gentleman or a lady, and to <b>do</b> <b>odd</b> <b>jobs</b> of carting and agriculture at a pinch. This obliging quadruped seemed to furnish Giles with a means of reinstating himself in Melbury's good opinion as a man of considerateness by throwing out future possibilities to Grace.|$|E

6000|$|... “Yes, I think so. When {{they see}} that a fellow is willing and anxious to learn, it is sure to do him good in the long run. It will help him on, and perhaps {{in two or three}} years he may get rated as an able seaman, and no longer be {{regarded}} as a boy, useful only to <b>do</b> <b>odd</b> <b>jobs.</b> One of the midshipmen is going to give me some help with my navigation. I wish, Tom, you would take it up too, but I am afraid it would be no use. You have got to learn a tremendous lot before you can master it, and what little you were taught at our school would hardly help you at all.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't intend to. But as {{for having}} him here to worry my life out and {{keep me in}} a {{perpetual}} stew, I just won't do it. D'ye think I'm going to trouble myself about children at my age? And all he'd cost for clothes and schooling, too! I can't afford it. I don't suppose his father expected it either. I suppose he expected me to look after him a bit--and of course I will. A boy of his age {{ought to be able}} to earn his keep, anyway. If I look out a place for him somewhere where he can <b>do</b> <b>odd</b> <b>jobs</b> and go to school in the winter, I think it's all anyone can expect of me, when he ain't really no blood relation." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{had been}} {{travelling}} {{with a large}} party for mutual security against Indians and Mormons, and {{so long as the}} journey lasted Dick had got on fairly well. He was always ready to <b>do</b> <b>odd</b> <b>jobs,</b> and as the draught cattle were growing weaker and weaker, and every pound of weight was of importance, no one grudged him his rations in return for his services; but when the company began to descend the slopes of the Sierra Nevada they began to break up, going off by twos and threes to the diggings, of which they heard such glowing accounts. Some, however, kept straight on to Sacramento, determining there to obtain news as to the doings at all the different places, and then to choose that which seemed to offer the best prospects of success.|$|E

6000|$|... "It was a {{long time}} before I could get the hang of things about yer, for I was used to company and excitement. I couldn't get any woman to help me, and a man I dursen't trust; but what with the Indians hereabout, who'd <b>do</b> <b>odd</b> <b>jobs</b> for me, and having {{everything}} sent from the North Fork, Jim and I managed to worry through. The Doctor would run up from Sacramento once in a while. He'd ask to see 'Miggles's baby,' as he called Jim, and when he'd go away, he'd say, 'Miggles; you're a trump--God bless you'; and it didn't seem so lonely after that. But the last time he was here he said, as he opened the door to go, 'Do you know, Miggles, your baby will {{grow up to be a}} man yet and an honor to his mother; but not here, Miggles, not here!' And I thought he went away sad--and--and--" [...] and here Miggles's voice and head were somehow both lost completely in the shadow.|$|E
6000|$|... "While a daily {{paper is}} not {{appropriate}} in Millville, a weekly paper, distributed throughout Chazy County, would not only be desirable but {{could be made to}} pay an excellent yearly profit. Through the enterprise of Joe Wegg, Millville is destined to grow rapidly from this time on, and Chazy County is populous enough to support a good weekly paper, in any event. Therefore, my proposition is this: To turn the plant over to Mr. and Mrs. Thursday Smith, who will change the name to the Millville Weekly Tribune and run it as a permanent institution. Your only expense for labor will be one assistant to set type and <b>do</b> <b>odd</b> <b>jobs,</b> since you are so competent that you can attend to all else yourselves. We will cut out the expensive news service we have heretofore indulged in and dispense with the private telegraph wire. Joe Wegg says he'll furnish you with what power you need free of all charge, because the paper will boost Millville's interests, with which his own interests are identified. Now, then, {{tell me what you think}} of my proposal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir. On my very counter, sir," [...] said he. [...] "What we pay {{rates and}} taxes for I don't know, when any ruffian {{can come in and}} break one's goods. Yes, sir, it was I who sold Dr. Barnicot his two statues. Disgraceful, sir! A Nihilist plot--that's what I make it. No one but an anarchist would go about {{breaking}} statues. Red republicans--that's what I call 'em. Who did I get the statues from? I don't see what {{that has to do with}} it. Well, if you really want to know, I got them from Gelder & Co., in Church Street, Stepney. They are a well-known house in the trade, and have been this twenty years. How many had I? Three--two and one are three--two of Dr. Barnicot's, and one smashed in broad daylight on my own counter. Do I know that photograph? No, I don't. Yes, I do, though. Why, it's Beppo. He was a kind of Italian piece-work man, who made himself useful in the shop. He could carve a bit, and gild and frame, and <b>do</b> <b>odd</b> <b>jobs.</b> The fellow left me last week, and I've heard nothing of him since. No, I don't know where he came from nor where he went to. I had nothing against him while he was here. He was gone two days before the bust was smashed." ...|$|E
