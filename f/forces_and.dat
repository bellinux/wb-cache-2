30|$|Statistically {{significant}} difference was found from the ANOVA analysis (Table  2) between the two drilling processes on the <b>force</b> <b>and</b> torque for repeated drilling. Insignificant effect on the <b>force</b> <b>and</b> torque was found for repeated hole drilling by RUD, as their p values are greater than 0.05, and adjusted R 2 for <b>force</b> <b>and</b> torque is also– 0.019 and – 0.030 respectively. In other words, a statistically significant effect on <b>force</b> <b>and</b> torque was found for CD. P value of <b>force</b> <b>and</b> torque was found to be less than 0.05 and corresponding adjusted R 2 is 0.898 and 0.965 respectively.|$|R
5|$|Homeworld is a {{real-time}} strategy game set in space. Gameplay, {{as in most}} real-time strategy titles, {{is focused}} on gathering resources, building military <b>forces,</b> <b>and</b> using them to destroy enemy <b>forces</b> <b>and</b> accomplish an objective. The game includes both single-player and multiplayer modes; the single-player mode consists of one story-driven campaign, broken up into levels. In each level, the player has an objective to accomplish before they can end the level, though the ultimate objective of the mission can change as the level's story unfolds. Between each of the 16 levels is a hand-drawn, black-and-white cutscene with narrative voiceovers.|$|E

40|$|A {{dynamic force}} sensing method is {{proposed}} for a robot manipulator. A 6 -axis wrist force sensor which {{is commonly used}} for robot force sensing does not take the direct measurement of the <b>force</b> <b>and</b> moment applied to an end effector externally from {{the environment of the}} manipulator, but takes the resultant of the gravity, the inertial <b>force</b> <b>and</b> moment on the end effector, <b>and</b> the external <b>force</b> <b>and</b> moment. The separation of gravitational <b>and</b> inertial <b>force</b> <b>and</b> moment from the measurement of the force sensor is crucial to achieving dynamically accurate <b>force</b> sensing <b>and</b> fast manipulator motion under force feedback control. A mathematical model is derived for the <b>force</b> sensing process <b>and</b> the separation of the <b>force</b> <b>and</b> moment as a nonlinear optimal state estimation problem formulated. Then an approximate solution is given using extended Kalman filtering techniques...|$|R

40|$|For {{robot arm}} {{set-point}} control, a novel PD based algorithm for the estimation and compensation of gravity <b>force</b> <b>and</b> static friction is proposed. Based on the linear-in-parameter {{property of the}} gravity <b>force</b> <b>and</b> the steady state feature of PD set-point control, the algorithm modifies the set-points according to the steady state position errors. Using the steady state equations near the given set-points the unknown static friction <b>force</b> <b>and</b> gravity <b>force</b> can be calculated on-line. This information can then be used to compensate the affects of gravity <b>force</b> <b>and</b> static friction to eliminate set-point errors...|$|R
40|$|This paper characterises the {{properties}} of unsymmetric bistable carbon fibre composites actuated using a single piezoelectric macro fibre actuator. A piezoelectric–laminate combination under two-axis constraint was evaluated {{in terms of its}} load–deflection characteristics, snap-through <b>force</b> <b>and</b> stiffness. The load–deflection characteristics indicate that snap-through <b>force</b> <b>and</b> laminate stiffness increase as a function of piezoelectric actuator drive-voltage. Both snap-through <b>force</b> <b>and</b> laminate stiffness are significantly increased under two-axis constraint, as compared to single-axis constraint. Snap-through <b>force</b> <b>and</b> stiffness are shown to be affected by localised curvature variation caused by laminate ageing...|$|R
