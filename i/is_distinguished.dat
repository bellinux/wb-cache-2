5|$|C. f. funereus, the {{nominate}} form, {{is known}} as the eastern yellow-tailed black cockatoo.

5|$|Cyathus helenae <b>is</b> <b>distinguished</b> {{from the}} more common C.striatus by its faint inner-surface {{plication}} (C.striatus has a more pronounced plication), the nodular arrangement of the hairs on the outer surface, and microscopically by the spore shape – ellipsoid in C.striatus, ovoid or spheroidal in C.helenae.|$|E
5|$|Geastrum welwitschii is morphologically {{similar to}} G.fornicatum in having fornicate, mostly 3–6 rays, of exoperidia and a {{cup-shaped}} mycelial layer. Geastrum welwitschii <b>is</b> <b>distinguished</b> from G.fornicatum by its epigeal mycelial cup with a felted or tufted outer surface.|$|E
50|$|They can <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> {{from the}} vasa recta {{by the absence}} of blood, and they can <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> from the thick {{ascending}} limb by the thickness of the epithelium.|$|R

5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>distinguished</b> {{from the}} desert hare (Lepus tibetanus), by its lack of black near the tip the {{peripheries}} of the ears. It is also distinguished from the Lepus oiostolus pallipes, by its lack of grey at the rump. It is also smaller in size and has thinner legs, than both the desert hare and the Lepus oiostolus pallipes.|$|E

50|$|Some authors {{classify}} {{this species}} as Stagnicola terebra, because the genus Catascopia Meier-Brook & Bargues, 2002 should not <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> based on DNA analysis only (genera should <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> morphologically and anatomically).|$|R

5|$|Nine {{species of}} Perovskia are recognized. P.abrotanoides shares {{much of the}} range of P.atriplicifolia, but <b>is</b> <b>distinguished</b> by its bipinnate leaves. Hybrids between these two species may occur naturally. Restricted to Turkestan in its native range, P.scrophularifolia is less upright; some forms have white flowers. The flowers of P.scabiosifolia are yellow.|$|E
5|$|Sociology <b>is</b> <b>distinguished</b> {{from various}} general social studies courses, which bear little {{relation}} to sociological theory or to social-science research-methodology. The US National Science Foundation classifies sociology as a STEM field.|$|E
5|$|Tall {{and slender}} forms of Mycena polygramma {{somewhat}} resemble M.pullata or M.praelonga. The former species <b>is</b> <b>distinguished</b> by its color, {{and the latter}} by its relationship to M.alcalina and its habitat on sphagnum.|$|E
5|$|Sphecius grandis can <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> from S.convallis (the Pacific cicada killer wasp) by the {{coloration}} {{pattern of}} the gastral tergites. Formerly, the two species <b>were</b> <b>distinguished</b> {{on the basis of}} the number of tergites with yellow markings (five in S.grandis and three in S.convallis), but a more recent study showed that this character <b>was</b> insufficient to <b>distinguish</b> the two species. However, they can <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> by the density of the punctation on the first and second tergites.|$|R

5|$|The rare Pacific Northwest morel Morchella hotsonii, {{known only}} from its type collection, is quite similar in {{appearance}} to M.importuna. The former species <b>is</b> <b>distinguished</b> by its finely velvety surface.|$|E
5|$|The variety R.botrytis var. aurantiiramosa <b>is</b> <b>distinguished</b> {{from the}} more common variety by the orange color of the upper branches. Variety compactospora tends to show a more {{pronounced}} wine-red, purple, or reddish color in the branch tips, and has smaller spores measuring 9.2–12.8 by 4–5.4µm.|$|E
50|$|Sphecius grandis can <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> from S. convallis (the Pacific cicada killer wasp) by the {{coloration}} {{pattern of}} the gastral tergites.

50|$|This genus is {{sometimes}} {{considered to be}} a subgenus of Haplotrema. Haplotrema and Ancotrema cannot <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> only {{on the basis of their}} shells, but can <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> on the basis of their detailed internal anatomy.|$|R
50|$|This frog can <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> {{from all}} other Mixophyes species by the blue {{crescent}} in the upper iris, except for Mixophyes fleayi. It can <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> from Mixophyes fleayi {{by the lack of}} mottling on the flanks.|$|R
5|$|Agaricus bitorquis, also edible, has {{a similar}} appearance, but can be {{distinguished}} by its double ring, {{and the lack of}} a fishy or briny odor. Additionally, A.bitorquis does not stain reddish when cut, and usually does not have a scaly or warty cap. The Hungarian species A.bernardiiformis, named for its similarity to A.bernardii, <b>is</b> <b>distinguished</b> from the latter by its smaller spores (6.2–8.2 by 5.4–6.2μm) and its club-shaped cheilocystidia that measure 17–35 by 7–9.5μm. MycoBank, however, considers the two species to be conspecific.|$|E
5|$|Amanita onusta may be {{confused}} with A.cinereoconia because of the similar gray powdery veil remnants on the cap surface. A.cinereoconia <b>is</b> <b>distinguished</b> from A.onusta {{by the absence of}} clamps, its powdery-wooly to powdery-warty cap, as well as the absence of warts or scales {{at the base of the}} stipe. A.cinereoconia also smells distinctly of chloride of lime. Another similar species is A.costaricensis, found only in Costa Rica. A.atkinsoniana, another North American species, has shorter warts that are spaced further apart than those of A.onusta, and the warts on the basal bulb are arranged in parallel rows.|$|E
5|$|As a {{pervasive}} developmental disorder, Asperger syndrome <b>is</b> <b>distinguished</b> by {{a pattern of}} symptoms rather than a single symptom. It is characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction, by stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior, activities and interests, and by no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or general delay in language. Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided verbosity, restricted prosody, and physical clumsiness are typical of the condition, but are not required for diagnosis. Suicidal behavior appears to occur at rates similar to those without ASD.|$|E
