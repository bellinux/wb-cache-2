Similitude based MapReduce Sets for Replicated <b>Join</b> Expression Analysis and MapReduce Sets for Assignment is expected to adhere to fundamental principles of the scientific Replicated <b>Join</b> process that are expressiveness of Replicated <b>Join</b> models and reproducibility of their Replicated <b>Join</b> inference. Replicated <b>Join</b> expressions are assumed to be elements of a Replicated <b>Join</b> expression space or Conjecture class and Replicated <b>Join</b> data provide “information ” which of these Replicated <b>Join</b> expressions should be used to interpret the Replicated <b>Join</b> data. An inference Replicated <b>Join</b> algorithm constructs the mapping between Replicated <b>Join</b> data and Replicated <b>Join</b> expressions, in particular by a Replicated <b>Join</b> cost minimization process. Fluctuations in the Replicated <b>Join</b> data often limit the Replicated <b>Join</b> precision, which we can achieve to uniquely identify a single Replicated <b>Join</b> expression as interpretation of the Replicated <b>Join</b> data. We advocate an information theoretic perspective on Replicated <b>Join</b> expression analysis to resolve this dilemma where the tradeoff between Replicated <b>Join</b> informativeness of statistical inference Replicated <b>Join</b> and their Replicated <b>Join</b> stability is mirrored in the information-theoretic Replicated <b>Join</b> optimum of high Replicated <b>Join</b> information rate and zero communication expression error.

40|$|Database query {{processing}} traditionally {{relies on}} three alternative <b>join</b> algorithms: in-dex nested loops <b>join</b> exploits an index on its inner input, merge <b>join</b> exploits sorted inputs, and hash <b>join</b> exploits {{differences in the}} sizes of the <b>join</b> inputs. Cost-based query optimi-zation chooses the most appropriate algorithm for each query and for each operation. Un-fortunately, mistaken algorithm choices during compile-time query optimization are com-mon yet expensive to investigate and to resolve. Our goal is to end mistaken choices among <b>join</b> algorithms by replacing the three tra-ditional <b>join</b> algorithms with a single one. Like merge <b>join,</b> this new <b>join</b> algorithm exploits sorted inputs. Like hash <b>join,</b> it exploits different input sizes for unsorted inputs. In fact, for unsorted inputs, the cost functions for recursive hash <b>join</b> and for hybrid hash <b>join</b> have guided our search for the new <b>join</b> algorithm. In consequence, the new <b>join</b> algorithm can replace both merge <b>join</b> and hash <b>join</b> in a database management system. The in-memory components of the new <b>join</b> algorithm employ indexes. If the database contains indexes for one (or both) of the inputs, the new <b>join</b> can exploit persistent indexes instead of temporary in-memory indexes. Using database indexes to match input records, the new <b>join</b> algorithm can also replace index nested loops <b>join.</b> Results from an implementation of the core algorithm are reported. ...|$|R
