5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) orders Darryl to hire {{replacements}} for the warehouse staff, but Darryl is wallowing in his depression and neglects to <b>even</b> <b>look</b> at the applications. With an order due out {{for one of}} Phyllis Vance's (Phyllis Smith) most important clients, Andy asks for volunteers to step in {{for the day and}} make sure that the order is shipped out. Jim, Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) take over the process, (however, in a talking-head interview, Kevin states that he will deliberately do a poor job because he did not volunteer and was merely suggested for the job because of his large size), but {{do not know how to}} use the heavy-lifting equipment and balk at the notion of carrying all the heavy boxes by hand. Upon Kevin's suggestion, they create an oil luge to slide the boxes across the floor resulting in a lot of damaged inventory. They retool Kevin's idea throughout the day, resulting in still more damaged inventory, and Phyllis ultimately loses the client.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{reading the}} paper, Jack sees an {{advertisement}} about the heir {{of the late}} Lord Stanley. He heads to Hotel Astor and learns that he has received his father's entire fortune. The lawyer accepts a dinner invitation at the wealthy American's house and brings along Jack. The father urges his daughter to win the affections of the rich, handsome and unmarried young Lord Stanley. Upon his arrival, the father who had shunned him is taken aback and greets him, but Ann refuses to <b>even</b> <b>look</b> at the guest. She ignores him, and refuses to face him even as they head towards the dining room, but Jack attempts to kiss her and she pulls away. Suddenly, Ann sees it is Jack and embraces him with a kiss.|$|E

25|$|The Landscape {{with the}} Fall of Icarus, now {{thought to be}} an early copy, {{combines}} several elements of northern Renaissance painting. It hints at the renewed interest for antiquity (the Icarus legend), but the hero Icarus is hidden away in the background. The main actors in the painting are nature itself and, most prominently, the peasant, who does not <b>even</b> <b>look</b> up from his plough when Icarus falls. Brueghel shows man as an anti-hero, comical and sometimes grotesque.|$|E
25|$|Evangelia was {{convinced}} that her third child would be a boy; her disappointment at the birth of another daughter {{was so great that}} she refused to <b>even</b> <b>look</b> at her new baby for four days. Maria was christened three years later at the Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in 1926. When Maria was 4, George Callas opened his own pharmacy, settling the family in Manhattan on 192nd Street in Washington Heights where Callas grew up.|$|E

25|$|Nil In The Dark: A {{player who}} bids Nil In The Dark shuffles their cards {{and puts them}} face {{down in front of}} them in a stack. When it is their play, they take the top card and throw it into the pile. The scoring counts the same as Blind Nil. A player may also go Blind Nil In The Dark where they never <b>even</b> <b>look</b> at their cards. This is scored the same as a Big Mo. Nil In The Dark is usually only bid if they have no trump cards.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fifth}} book, Dumbledore is demoted from Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, voted {{out of the}} Chairmanship of the International Confederation of Wizards, and is almost {{stripped}} of his Order of Merlin First Class due to his speeches regarding the return of Voldemort, although it is reported that he is unconcerned {{as long as he}} is not taken off the Chocolate Frog cards. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Magic does everything they can to discredit him and Harry – mainly through the Daily Prophet. At the beginning of the book, Dumbledore enrages Fudge when he stops by at Harry's hearing with a witness (Arabella Figg) to ensure that he is not expelled. While Harry feels better when Dumbledore assists him, he becomes annoyed {{to the point of being}} angry that the headmaster refuses to speak to or <b>even</b> <b>look</b> at him.|$|E
25|$|On May 30, 2000, {{after the}} New York Knicks beat the Indiana Pacers on Game 4 of the 2000 NBA Eastern Conference Finals, Francesa and Russo {{intended}} {{to board a}} plane to Indianapolis to host Mike and the Mad Dog there. However, the flight got cancelled and the next flight did not have first class seats available. Since Francesa only rode planes with first class seats, {{he walked away from}} the airport and went to the studio. This angered Russo and later that day Russo exploded during a close-door meeting with management. According to Russo, that was their worst fight ever. The duo didn’t talk, or <b>even</b> <b>look</b> at each other, during commercial breaks for 2 and a half months. Francesa said he went on vacation in the summer of 2000 and told WFAN to figure something out because he refused to work with Russo again when he returned.|$|E

25|$|The fables in {{the third}} book, as well as others, do not {{strictly}} limit to matters of war and peace. Some present fables that demonstrate how different characters have different needs and motives, which is subjectively rational from each character's viewpoint, and that addressing these needs can empower peaceful relationships even if they start off in a different way. For example, in the fable The Old Man the Young Wife, the text relates a story wherein an old man marries a young woman from a penniless family. The young woman detests his appearance {{so much that she}} refuses to <b>even</b> <b>look</b> at him let alone consummate their marriage. One night, while she sleeps in the same bed with her back facing the old man, a thief enters their house. She is scared, turns over, and for security embraces the man. This thrills every limb of the old man. He feels grateful to the thief for making his young wife hold him at last. The aged man rises and profusely thanks the thief, requesting the intruder to take whatever he desires.|$|E
25|$|Shortly thereafter, a long battle {{began to}} return rail transit {{to the region}} and efforts for {{additional}} lines continue at a snail’s pace. It took 32 years to see the first line implemented. In 1972, the Regional Fixed Guideway Study for MTC proposed a $1.3 billion 37- or 57-mile (sources differ) heavy-rail rapid transit system, but the then-separate Metropolitan Council disagreed with that idea—refusing to <b>even</b> <b>look</b> at the plan—and continuing political battles prevented its implementation. The Met Council had its own plans for bus rapid transit in the Cities. Another system using smaller people movers was proposed in the 1975 Small Vehicle Fixed Guideway Study and gained the most traction with the Saint Paul city council, but was eventually dropped in 1980. In the 1980s, light rail was proposed as an alternative and several possible corridors were identified, including the Central Corridor, for which a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) was drawn up in 1982. However, it was another two decades before the Blue Line light rail line began operation on June 26, 2004, by then, just over 50 years since the last regular-service streetcar ran on June 19, 1954, under the old Twin City Lines. Heavy-rail commuter service began on November 14, 2009, with the Northstar Line. The 2010s decade may finally see several new lines open.|$|E

500|$|Zito's fastball has hovered between [...] and [...] He augments it with {{a circle}} changeup and a curveball that he uses as a strikeout pitch. His curveball was voted {{the best in the}} Major Leagues in a player poll {{conducted}} by Sports Illustrated in 2005. Alex Rodriguez once stated that he {{had never seen anything like}} Zito's curveball, commenting: [...] "It's such a high one, and it drops three to four feet. You might as well not <b>even</b> <b>look</b> for it because you're not going to hit it." ...|$|E
500|$|As Hornsby {{recalled}} later, Ruth [...] "didn't say a word. He didn't <b>even</b> <b>look</b> {{around or}} up at me. He just picked {{himself up and}} walked away". Ruth's failed attempt to steal second base ended {{the game and the}} 1926 World Series; it is, as of 2016, the only time a World Series has ended with a runner being caught stealing. Ruth explained later that he attempted to steal second base because he thought no one would expect it. He hoped that by getting to second base, he could have an easier chance at scoring if Meusel hit a single into the outfield.|$|E

500|$|Dworkin's {{short fiction}} and novels often {{incorporated}} elements from {{her life and}} themes from her nonfiction writing, sometimes related by a first-person narrator.

I am not an exhibitionist. I do not show myself. I am not asking for forgiveness. I {{do not want to}} confess. But I have used everything I know—my life—to show what I believe must be shown {{so that it can be}} faced. The imperative at the heart of my writing—what must be done—comes directly from my life.

500|$|A {{negative}} {{review in}} the column [...] "Avoidable Crudites" [...] by C. H. Claudy in The Moving Picture World found great faults with the production. Claudy wrote.

When Sophia Holland, her second cousin and a close friend, grew ill from typhus and died in April 1844, Emily was traumatized. Recalling the incident two years later, Emily wrote that [...] "it seemed to me I should die too if I could not be permitted to watch over her or <b>even</b> <b>look</b> at her face." [...] She became so melancholic that her parents sent her to stay with family in Boston to recover. With her health and spirits restored, she soon returned to Amherst Academy to continue her studies. During this period, she first met people who were to become lifelong friends and correspondents, such as Abiah Root, Abby Wood, Jane Humphrey, and Susan Huntington Gilbert (who later married Emily's brother Austin).|$|E
