With an IC engine, a particular sized engine will have a particular power output. Typically a model airplane manufacturer will recommend a 2-cycle glow plug motor by its size (typically [...]40-.60 cubic inch for the average sized plane) Since <b>electric</b> <b>motors</b> <b>operate</b> over a much wider range, there was no good way to recommend an <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> for a plane.|$|R
50|$|An <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> {{converts}} {{electrical energy}} into mechanical energy. The reverse process of electrical generators, most <b>electric</b> <b>motors</b> <b>operate</b> through interacting magnetic fields and current-carrying conductors to generate rotational force. Motors and generators have many similarities and {{many types of}} <b>electric</b> <b>motors</b> can be run as generators, and vice versa.Electric motors are found in applications as diverse as industrial fans, blowers and pumps, machine tools, household appliances, power tools, and disk drives.

50|$|<b>Electric</b> {{outboard}} <b>motors</b> are {{an option}} for boat propulsion. Most <b>electric</b> outboard <b>motors</b> have 0.5 to 4 kW direct current (DC) <b>electric</b> <b>motors,</b> <b>operated</b> at 12 to 60 volts DC. These systems have the propeller fixed directly to the motor, which is mounted in the lower unit under water - see trolling motor. This setup limits the power output. Recently developed outboard motors are powered with an alternating current (AC) or DC <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> in the power head like a conventional petrol engine. With this setup, a motor can produce 10 kW output or more {{and is able to}} replace a petrol engine of 15 HP or more. The advantage of the induction or asynchronous motor is the power transfer to the rotor by means of electromagnetic induction. As these engines do not use permanent magnets, they require less maintenance and develop more torque at lower RPM.|$|R

50|$|The {{universal}} motor is {{so named because}} it is a type of <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> that can <b>operate</b> on AC or DC power. It is a commutated series-wound motor where the stator's field coils are connected in series with the rotor windings through a commutator. It {{is often referred to as}} an AC series motor. The {{universal motor}} is very similar to a DC series motor in construction, but is modified slightly to allow the <b>motor</b> to <b>operate</b> properly on AC power. This type of <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> can <b>operate</b> well on AC because the current in both the field coils and the armature (and the resultant magnetic fields) will alternate (reverse polarity) synchronously with the supply. Hence the resulting mechanical force will occur in a consistent direction of rotation, independent of the direction of applied voltage, but determined by the commutator and polarity of the field coils.|$|R
50|$|The first {{applications}} of commercial electric power were incandescent lighting and commutator-type <b>electric</b> <b>motors.</b> Both devices <b>operate</b> well on DC, but DC {{could not be}} easily changed in voltage, and was generally only produced at the required utilization voltage.|$|R

The power transmission system of an EC is modelled once with a DC permanent magnet (PM) and once with an AC induction motor (IM). In both cases the <b>electric</b> <b>motors</b> can <b>operate</b> in two modes: propulsion mode (motor) and regenerative brake mode (generator). Two standard velocity history profiles SFUDS and ECE- 15 are used to model the dynamic of the car. It is shown that IM performs more effective than PM...|$|R

50|$|The main {{application}} of AMTs are the grid distribution transformers rated at about 50-1000 kVA. These transformers typically run 24 {{hours a day}} and at a low load factor (average load divided by nominal load).

Amorphous iron is also used in specialized <b>electric</b> <b>motors</b> that <b>operate</b> at high frequencies of perhaps 350 Hz or more.|$|R
40|$|Large <b>electric</b> <b>motors</b> {{serve as}} the prime movers to drive high {{capacity}} pumps, fans, compressors, and generators {{in a variety of}} nuclear plant systems. This study examined the stressors that cause degradation and aging in large <b>electric</b> <b>motors</b> <b>operating</b> in various plant locations and environments. The operating history of these machines in nuclear plant service was studied by review and analysis of failure reports in the NPRDS and LER databases. This was supplemented by a review of motor designs, and their nuclear and balance of plant applications, in order to characterize the failure mechanisms that cause degradation, aging, and failure in large <b>electric</b> <b>motors.</b> A generic failure modes and effects analysis for large squirrel cage induction motors was performed to identify the degradation and aging mechanisms affecting various components of these large motors, the failure modes that result, and their effects upon the function of the motor. The effects of large motor failures upon the systems in which they are operating, and on the plant as a whole, were analyzed from failure reports in the databases. The effectiveness of the industry`s large motor maintenance programs was assessed based upon the failure reports in the databases and reviews of plant maintenance procedures and programs...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} {{motorcycles}} are causing urban source of unregulated pollutants which are hazardous to environment and human health. Hybrid electric motorcycle (HEM) {{could be a}} solution to the problem as the electric system operates at high efficiency, allow diversification of energy resources, zero local emission and work silently. A HEM with parallel drive-train configuration has better fuel economy but post complex drive-train. In this paper, a parallel drive-train is proposed where two numbers of one way clutch are used to isolate the power source components when operating at different speed. The parallel drive-train allows the control unit to utilize and manage the power sources efficiently by operating at various modes based on the driving requirement. Meantime, maximum torque is available in blended mode when the internal combustion engine and <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> <b>operate</b> simultaneously.

5000|$|Specific thrust (net thrust/intake airflow) is an {{important}} parameter for turbofans and jet engines in general. Imagine a fan (driven by an appropriately sized <b>electric</b> <b>motor)</b> <b>operating</b> within a pipe, which is connected to a propelling nozzle. It is fairly obvious, the higher the fan pressure ratio (fan discharge pressure/fan inlet pressure), the higher the jet velocity and the corresponding specific thrust. Now imagine we replace this set-up with an equivalent turbofan - same airflow and same fan pressure ratio. Obviously, {{the core of the}} turbofan must produce sufficient power to drive the fan via the low-pressure (LP) turbine. If we choose a low (HP) turbine inlet temperature for the gas generator, the core airflow needs to be relatively high to compensate. The corresponding bypass ratio is therefore relatively low. If we raise the turbine inlet temperature, the core airflow can be smaller, thus increasing bypass ratio. Raising turbine inlet temperature tends to increase thermal efficiency and, therefore, improve fuel efficiency.|$|R

40|$|The {{electric}} vehicle {{is becoming increasingly}} prevalent as a viable option to replace hydrocarbon fuelled vehicles, and as such the development of high efficiency fully electric drivetrains is a particularly relevant research topic. The drivetrain topology {{is one of the}} main focuses of research on fully electric drivetrains, because of the variety of available options. For example, the adoption of multiple-speed mechanical transmissions can improve both the performance and energy consumption when compared to a single-speed transmission. A four-speed, dual motor drivetrain design is presented in this article which works on the principle of two double-speed transmissions, each driven by a separate motor linked through a sole secondary shaft. This drivetrain architecture provides increased flexibility of the <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> <b>operating</b> points, theoretically being beneficial to the overall efficiency of the system for any driving condition. This paper presents the design of the transmission, its governing equations and the method adopted to optimize the state selection map and <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> torque distribution.

5000|$|On November 30, 2011, {{as part of}} the {{publicity}} surrounding the 2011 Tokyo Auto Show, Honda announced a new implementation of SH-AWD as part of its [...] "Earth Dreams Technology". The new hybrid electric SH-AWD would be based on an all new 3.5 L V-6 and three <b>electric</b> <b>motors</b> and lithium-ion battery technology. The V-6 would be mated to a 30 kW <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> which could <b>operate</b> independently of the V-6, unlike earlier mild hybrid Honda IMA configurations. In addition, each rear wheel would have a 20 kW <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> that would <b>operate</b> independently, varying torque as conditions demand. On a turn, the <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> would apply torque to the outside rear wheel, while the inside rear wheel motor would drag, amplifying the SH-AWD effect. At the same time, the dragging motor would act as a generator, feeding power to the outside wheel motor. If the lithium ion pack became depleted, the V-6 would power the front <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> as generator to feed electricity to rear wheels while also charging the battery. A prototype of this system was shown in a test mule using an 8th generation North American version of the Honda Accord.|$|R
