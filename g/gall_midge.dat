5|$|B. coccinea is a {{host for}} the <b>gall</b> <b>midge</b> Dasineura banksiae, {{a species of}} fly that attacks and lays eggs on the leaves between late October and early December. The round white hairy galls are 5–7mm in {{diameter}} and generally contain one larva, or up to five on severely infested plants. The larvae moult and feed until January to March, when they reduce activity until early October. Although these are not harmful to the plant, they disfigure the cut foliage and hence reduce its value.|$|E

25|$|Rice pests are any organisms or {{microbes}} {{with the}} potential to reduce the yield or value of the rice crop (or of rice seeds). Rice pests include weeds, pathogens, insects, nematode, rodents, and birds. A variety of factors can contribute to pest outbreaks, including climatic factors, improper irrigation, the overuse of insecticides and high rates of nitrogen fertilizer application. Weather conditions also contribute to pest outbreaks. For example, rice <b>gall</b> <b>midge</b> and army worm outbreaks tend to follow periods of high rainfall early in the wet season, while thrips outbreaks are associated with drought.|$|E

The previous and current identification of these Korean <b>gall</b> <b>midges</b> relied largely upon their gall morph and host plant species that correspond to those of Japanese gall modges. The identification of these <b>gall</b> <b>midges</b> was considered to be mostly reliable, because DNA analysis suggested that some South Korean <b>gall</b> <b>midges</b> were indentical with Japanese <b>gall</b> <b>midges</b> when thwy induce the same sorts of gall on the same host plants as those in Japan. At the moment, 47 (88. 7 %) out of the 53 sorts of Korean <b>midge</b> <b>galls</b> were common to Japan.

40|$|Parallel {{alterations}} in {{the timing of}} ovarian Ecdysone Receptor and Ultraspiracle expression characterize the independent evolution of larval reproduction in two species of <b>gall</b> <b>midges</b> (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) Received: 30 July 1999 / Accepted: 23 Feburary 2000 Abstract Although most insects reproduce in the adult stage, facultative larval or pupal reproduction (paedogenesis) has evolved at least six times indepently in insects, twice in <b>gall</b> <b>midges</b> of the family Cecidomyiidae (Diptera). Paedogenesis in <b>gall</b> <b>midges</b> involves the precocious growth and differentiation of the ovary in an otherwise larval form. We have previously shown that the timing of expression of the Ecdysone Receptor (EcR) and Ultraspiracle (USP), the two proteins that constitute the functional receptor for the steroid hormone 20 -hydroxyecdysone, regulates the timing and progression of ovarian differentiation in Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera: Drosophilidae). Here we test the hypothesis that precocious activation of EcR and USP in the ovaries of paedogenetic <b>gall</b> <b>midges</b> allows for precocious ovarian differentiation. Using monoclonal antibodies directed against insect EcR and USP proteins, we first show that when these <b>gall</b> <b>midges</b> are reared under conditions that promote typical, metamorphic development, upregulation of EcR and USP occurs in the final larval stage. By contrast, in the paedogenetic life cycle, EcR and USP are up-regulated early in the first larval stage. A similar pattern is seen for two independently-evolved paedogenetic <b>gall</b> <b>midges,</b> Heteropeza pygmaea and Mycophila speyeri. We discuss our results {{in the context of}} developmental constraints on the evolution of paedogenesis in dipteran insects...|$|R
