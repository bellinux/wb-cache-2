Okara, residue from soymilk production, was provided by two soymilk producing companies whose production systems {{were based on the}} hot disintegration of the decorticated (company B) or undecorticated (company A) soybeans. The okara was dehydrated using a flash dryer and then ground into flour (> 420 µm). However, The okara flours A and B showed approximately the same amount of protein (35 and 40 g. 100 g- 1 dwb). However, the okara flour A presented higher values (p < 0. 05) for all technological functional properties studied (emulsification capacity, emulsion stability, protein solubility, and water hold capacity) than those of okara flour B. The A and B okara flours were used in a <b>frankfurter</b> <b>sausage</b> formulation as substitution of 1. 5 % and 4 % of meat.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The production stages are as follows. Mince lean, virtually fat-free meat, and cool down to 0 - 3 deg. C. Comminute (by cutting) about 2 / 3 of the meat, adding spice, seasoning and phosphate and nitrite pickling salt and 250 - 300 g filling per kilo of meat, {{in the form of}} ice, up to 10 - 12 deg. C. Add the remaining, previously slightly frozen mince portion, and from about 50 - 70 g filling per kilo of total meat weight in the form of cooled water, in the processor (cutter). There reduce to sausage meat at 13 - 15 deg. C. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a sausage for heating in water, made as described, and containing only 2 - 3 % fat. USE - To make a low fat sausage for water-heating. ADVANTAGE - Use of lean meat and avoidance of fat as an additive reduces fat content of the product. By ice addition, comminution can be prolonged, resulting in a finer sausage meat, which can be emulsified without fat. Water addition together with the remaining meat, confers the required sheen to the meat, also preventing excessive dryness. A tasty, low-fat, e. g. Frankfurter-type sausage results...|$|E
40|$|Frankfurter-type {{sausages}} {{were prepared}} with potassium lactate, sodium diacetate and {{various levels of}} a mixture of potassium lactate and sodium diacetate. The development of Lactobacillus sake and Listeria monocytogenes and the sensory quality were compared with a reference product without any of these additions. It was shown that addition of 2 - 3 % of a solution, containing a mixture of 56 % potassium lactate and 4 % sodium diacetate to Frankfurter-type sausages inhibited the development of L. sake and L. monocytogenes bacteria inoculated on to the product during storage at 4 °C. L. sake bacteria were mainly inhibited {{by the addition of}} lactates and its water activity lowering effect, resulting in a shelf-life extension with 75 - 125 %. In <b>Frankfurter</b> <b>sausage</b> with 0. 1 % sodium diacetate L. sake was not inhibited, but the development of L. monocytogenes was retarded. The increase of L. monocytogenes also slowed down when L. sake numbers reached 108 cfug- 1, probably as a result of lactic acid and/or bacteriocins production in those products. A synergistic effect of the combined addition of lactate and diacetate was observed {{at the end of the}} shelf-life, where L. monocytogenes was inhibited in Frankfurters with mixtures of potassium lactate and sodium diacetate while some growth was observed in products only containing potassium lactate. Sensory properties of the product were not significantly influenced by the addition of 2 - 3 % of solutions containing a potassium lactate/sodium diacetate mixture. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Staphylococcal {{enterotoxin}} A (SEA) is {{the most}} common enterotoxin found in outbreaks of staphylococcal food poisoning (SFP). Based on the amount of SEA produced, S. aureus strains were divided into two main groups, high- and low-SEA-producing strains. The differences in the amounts of SEA formed were found {{to be associated with the}} levels of expression of the sea gene and the bacteriophage version of sea, i. e. sea 1 or sea 2. Furthermore, differences in the nucleotide sequence of the Siphoviridae phage region showed two clonal lineages of the high-SEA-producing strains. One of these lines was associated with the capacity for a massive release of SEA through prophage induction, as demonstrating using mitomycin C (MC). This was also established by the detection of additional sea mRNA transcripts presumed to be initiated by a latent phage promoter located upstream of the endogenous sea promoter. The low-SEA-producing group and the high-SEA-producing subgroup lacking prophage-activated transcript of sea showed no increase in the production of SEA after the addition of MC. Thus, sea gene expression was found to be associated with the clonal lineage of the sea-encoding Siphoviridae phages. During the processing and preservation of food, organic acids such as acetic acid and lactic acid are widely used. The effects of acetic acid on the expression and formation of SEA in S. aureus were investigated in pH-controlled batch cultures carried out with two strains belonging to two clonal lineages of the high-SEA-producing strains. The sea expression profiles of both strains were comparable, with the relative expression peaking in the transition between exponential and stationary growth phase and falling during stationary phase at all pH values tested. The elevated sea expression in S. aureus was also found to be influenced by acetic acid, which induced the sea-encoding prophage and increased the intracellular copy number of the sea gene, linking SEA formation to the life cycle of the phage. The expression and formation of SEA was also studied in situ in pork sausage at low temperature (15 °C). Three strains with different sea genetic backbones, the two clonal lineages of the high-SEA-producing strains (sea 1) and the low-producing-strains (sea 2), respectively, were used. Prolonged periods of expression and formation of SEA—of at least fourteen days—were found relative to the short growth-associated periods of SEA production observed in planktonic batch cultivations. The growth patterns were similar in all three strains; however, a clear difference in SEA levels between the two high-SEA-producing strains and the low-SEA-producing strain was seen. More importantly, the SEA formation of the high-SEA-producing strain harbouring the prophage-inducible sea 1 gene was about three times higher than in the high-SEA-producing strain lacking phage-activated sea transcription. These results were in agreement with the previous prophage-activation results using MC. Without MC, this difference was not seen, indicating on-going prophage induction in situ. The complex food matrix of the <b>frankfurter</b> <b>sausage</b> and low temperature most likely influenced the formation of SEA in a way similar to that in MC treatment. In food, the high-SEA-producing group, and in particular the prophage-inducible sea 1 group, may be more relevant in SFP than the low-SEA-producing group, which mainly harbours sea 2. Environmental factors, including many preservatives and unfavourable temperature, can stimulate the expression and formation of SEA. Lactococcus lactis is very commonly used in the manufacture of many food products and as a biopreservative in food. The main function of L. lactis in food is to lower the pH by producing acids, e. g. formate, acetate, and lactate. A regulation mechanism that contributes to readjustment of the flux of ATP production in L. lactis was investigated. To varying degrees, ATP and ADP inhibit several dehydrogenases of the central carbon metabolism of Lactococcus lactis ATCC 19435 in vitro, i. e. glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Inhibition types and parameters by single and multiple inhibitors were determined; a mathematical model using Hill-type kinetics was introduced and developed, and showed greater flexibility than the usual parabolic inhibition equation. Model discrimination suggested that the weak allosteric inhibition of GAPDH had no relevance when multiple inhibitors were present. Interestingly, with ADH and GAPDH, the combination of ATP and ADP showed lower dissociation constants than with either inhibitor alone. Moreover, the concerted inhibition of ADH and GAPDH, but not of LDH, showed synergy between the two nucleotides. Similar kinetics, but without synergies, were found for ADHs from horse liver and yeast, indicating that dehydrogenases can be modulated by these nucleotides in a non-linear manner in many organisms. The action of an elevated pool of ATP and ADP may effectively inactivate lactococcal ADH, but not GAPDH and LDH, providing leverage for the observed metabolic shift to homolactic acid formation in resting lactococcal cells supplied with maltose...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of salt substitutes on the textural, microstructural and sensory properties in low-cost <b>frankfurter</b> <b>sausages</b> produced using mechanically deboned poultry meat (MDPM) as a potential strategy to reduce sodium in this meat product. In nine treatments, blends of calcium, sodium and potassium chloride were used to substitute 25 % or 50 % of the NaCl in sausages (at the same ionic strength and molar basis equivalent to 2 % NaCl). When NaCl was partially replaced by 50 % CaCl 2 (F 6), the batter presented the highest total liquid released, and the corresponding final product showed increased hardness when compared to the control formulation (100 % NaCl, C 1). Its respective microstructural analysis revealed numerous pores arranged in a noncompacted matrix, which could be explained by the lowest emulsion stability reported for samples with 50 % CaCl 2 and 50 % NaCl. <b>Frankfurter</b> <b>sausages</b> produced using blends containing 25 % CaCl 2 (F 2, F 4) and 25 and 50 % KCl (F 4, F 5) did not exhibit differences in the pH, aw and objective color in the frankfurters (p< 0. 05). The overall acceptability and flavor of the frankfurters containing 50 % NaCl without salt substitution (C 3), 25 % CaCl 2, 25 % KCl (F 4), and 50 % KCl (F 5) showed the worst scores compared to those of the control formulation (C 1).

40|$|Most {{available}} predictive {{models are}} developed {{on the basis}} of data obtained in liquid microbiological media, or by challenge tests in real foods. Although liquid microbiological media are convenient and reproducible, they do not include the effect of different food (micro) structures, such as aqueous gels, emulsions and gelled emulsions. On the other hand, in challenge tests all factors influencing microbial growth are included, but they lack in reproducibility, are expensive and time-consuming. The aim of this dissertation was to investigate the effect of the food matrix complexity on the growth dynamics of L. monocytogenes, with particular focus on the influence of (i) the background microflora and (ii) the physicochemical characteristics and processing technology on <b>Frankfurter</b> <b>sausages</b> and (iii) the food (micro) structure by means of food (model) systems. The target microorganism was Listeria monocytogenes, as {{it is one of the}} major microbial threats in the food industry. The target food system was <b>Frankfurter</b> <b>sausages,</b> as they are easily available in market, complex in (micro) structure and related to cases of listeriosis. Model systems, which cover the whole spectrum of (micro) structural complexity and at the same time approach the compositional and physicochemical characteristics of the target food system, were produced. Firstly, it was necessary to define the fastest growing strain of L. monocytogenes, among three isolates from meat products. Growth dynamics of L. monocytogenes strains were compared with the aid of the Time-To-Detection (TTD) method, under physicochemical conditions similar to Frankfurters. This method exhibited a few limitations at stressing conditions and low inoculum levels. A sensitivity analysis of the factors that influence the output of this method (growth parameters) was carried out. Results demonstrated that the output of the method was significantly affected by all factors. The factors exhibiting the highest influence on the results were (i) the calibration curve relating viable plate counts and Optical Density (OD) data; (ii) the approach to estimate TTD values; (iii) the detection limit of OD measurements; and (iv) the range of the initial cell concentrations considered (N 0). Overall, lag phase (λ) estimates were more sensitive than maximum specific growth rate (μmax) estimates. The approach to estimate TTD values and the OD detection limit were the most influential factors for the μmax and λ estimation. Secondly, the effect of the dominant indigenous microflora (Leuconostoc carnosum) was studied on L. monocytogenes growth on vacuum packed <b>Frankfurter</b> <b>sausages.</b> Results demonstrated that at low temperature and high L. carnosum inoculum level, L. monocytogenes stops growing earlier than L. carnosum and the lowest maximum population is reached. Two models were used to fit the experimental data in order to facilitate the interpretation of the results. The Dens et al. model described species interactions, which revealed a predominant effect of L. carnosum on L. monocytogenes, and described the decrease phase of L. monocytogenes population. The Baranyi and Roberts model, a special case of the Dens et al. model for monoculture, estimated the apparent maximum population and brought into question the validity of the Jameson effect at low temperature, which describes the simultaneous halt of growth of two species in co-culture. Furthermore, compositional, physicochemical and processing aspects were evaluated on their influence on the growth dynamics of L. monocytogenes on real vacuum-packed Frankfurters. This work demonstrated that even products of the same commercial type might exhibit significant differences on their growth dynamics of L. monocytogenes. Results indicated that there were no major significant differences in physicochemical characteristics for two types of sausages but, there was statistically significant variability at the concentration of preservatives. Liquid systems, with the same preservatives’ level as the two types of sausages, exhibited a lower variability in growth dynamics of L. monocytogenes than the two types of sausages. This observation led to the conclusion that other factors, such as the presence or absence of the sausage casing, and differences in the (micro) structure and processing factors affect the growth dynamics ofL. monocytogenes on different types of <b>Frankfurter</b> <b>sausages.</b> The previous results served as a benchmark for the design and production of the model systems. The growth dynamics of L. monocytogenes were studied in/on these food (model) systems (liquids, aqueous gels, emulsions, gelled emulsions and canned meat, which was specifically ordered for the needs of this study and had specified composition). Results showed that L. monocytogenes grows faster on canned meat, then in the liquids followed by aqueous gels, gelled emulsions and finally in emulsions. These findings emphasised that predictive models that do not include the effect of food (micro) structure might underestimate the growth of foodborne pathogens, which poses a risk for the microbiological food safety. The importance of developing suitable food (model) systems that approach real food products and isolate the effect of the (micro) structure has been introduced in this dissertation, as it still remains a challenge. Overall, experimental data need to be collected and predictive models, which incorporate the combination of all factors influencing microbial growth need to be developed, in order to contribute and ensure microbiological food safety. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In Colombia, the {{production}} of red tilapia (Oreochromis sp) has shown important development in recent years. It is a hydro-biological resource that generates fish fillet waste {{that can be used}} in the manufacture of fish products. The aim of this research was to analyze the influence of quinoa flour on the physicochemical properties, texture and oxidative stability during storage and sale of <b>Frankfurter</b> <b>sausages</b> made with red tilapia fillet waste when adding two concentrations of quinoa flour, 10 g/kg and 20 g/kg, and a control treatment with no quinoa flour. The sausages were vacuum packed and stored under refrigeration (2 °C ± 2 °C). The proximate chemical composition, pH, CIElab coordinates, lipid oxidation, water holding capacity, water binding ability and cooking yield were determined, along with an instrumental texture analysis for each of the sausages prepared. The addition of quinoa flour at a concentration of 10 g/kg presented the best water holding capacity, water binding ability, lighter coloration and cooking yield, as compared to the control sausage. By contrast, the sausages with 20 g/kg were harder and required greater effort to cut than the control (p < 0. 05). The addition of quinoa flour increased fat oxidation after 6 days of monitoring. The addition of 10 g/kg of quinoa flour was the best concentration for {{the production}} of sausages made with red tilapia fillet waste, which represents a new alternative for hydro-biological-origin foodstuffs...|$|R
40|$|The European {{societies}} are requiring that animals {{to be raised}} {{as closely as possible}} to their natural conditions. The growing concerns about animal welfare is resulting in continuous modifications of regulations and policies that led to ban of a number of intensive farming methods. The European authorities consider the pig welfare as a priority issue. They are studying to ban surgical pig castration by 2018, which may seriously affect markets and consumers due to boar tainted-meat. This study analysed consumers’ preferences and acceptance regarding an alternative to castration of high-level boar-taint <b>frankfurter</b> <b>sausages.</b> Non-hypothetical discrete choice experiments was applied by creating a real shopping scenario before and after tasting the products. Data were collected for a sample of 150 consumers from the metropolitan area of Madrid, Spain. Different modelling approaches (Generalized Multinomial Logit-GMNL, Random Parameters Logit-RPL, WTP-space and Latent Class-LC models) were applied to figure out which model have the best goodness of fit. Results showed the appropriateness of the proposed alternative by using a new flavour as a masking strategy. When consumers tasted the products, they showed their willingness to pay a premium for this flavour. The WTP space model showed the best goodness of fit in terms of likelihood, Akaike information criterion and McFadden Pseudo R 2. Furthermore, the degree of randomness identified by the scale parameter is also estimated. Uncertainty in selection decreased significantly after the sensory experiencePostprint (published version...|$|R

40|$|Background. More {{and more}} poultry is {{intended}} {{for the production of}} boneless culinary meat both in Poland and other EU countries. The method in which meat is prepared causes inaccurate deboning, leaving a relatively meaningful amount of muscle tissue on the skeletal system. Loss of protein, beneficial for its nutritional value, reaches the level of a few percent of the total of the obtained meat mass. Thus, the issue of mechanically separated poultry meat (MSPM) utilization becomes significant. However, meat mechanically deboned may deteriorate the sensory quality of the final product with respect to characteristics such as taste, odour, consistency, and colour. In this context, the work is focused on an evaluation of selected quality features of the <b>frankfurter</b> type <b>sausage</b> with varied MSPM participation obtained from poultry necks and bodies. Material and methods. The research material was a <b>frankfurter</b> type <b>sausage,</b> made from class III pork – control sample K. In the other experimental samples, 25 % and 50 % of pork was substituted by MSPM obtained from necks (Sz 25 and Sz 50) and bodies (W 25 and W 50) of broilers of the COB breed. In the experimental sausages the following were measured: chemical composition and colour L*a*b* in CIE system. Then, sensory evaluation was carried out applying a 5 -point method. The obtained results were subjected to statistical analysis. Results. On the basis of the obtained results it was stated that the basic composition of the final product changed depending upon the type and amount of MSPM introduced into the raw material composition. The introduction of MSPM into the mentioned meat products composition brought about a significant decrease in the notation of characteristics such as odour, cross-section colour, and exterior colour, measured sensorically. However, the statistical analysis of the results did not show a significant impact of a partial substitution of pork meat with mechanically deboned poultry meat on the overall desirability of the model sausages. Conclusions. A partial substitution of pork meat with mechanically deboned poultry meat from broilers’ necks and bodies is possible. MSPM content of the raw material composition higher than 25 % may negatively influence some sensory quality characteristics. No significant impact of substitution of pork meat MSPM on physical colour parameters a* and b* was noticed, independently of the type of MSPM and amount of substitution in the raw material...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} the commodity and sensory evaluation of meat products from organic production and comparison with those from conventional production. The work also shows survey results relating to the consumption of organic meat products. Research material were processed meats (<b>frankfurter</b> and white <b>sausages)</b> from organic and conventional production offered in retail sales by two manufacturers. Organic products under investigation contain less salt, which significantly influenced the results of the sensory evaluation – have been assessed lower than conventional products. The results of the survey have shown that respondents prefer buying organic meat products – smoked meats and sausages type, which they mostly buy in supermarkets. Respondents know the tenets of organic production and are able to pay more for eco-friendly meat products...|$|R
