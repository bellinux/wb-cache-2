40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} is to compare high frequency to low frequency (50 Hz) technologies. To accomplish this, two highly optimized candidate converters are built to champion each of the inverter classes. Both candidates are constrained to produce the same quasi-sinusoidal output waveforms in identical operating conditions. The low frequency inverter is designed with optimization of its output power quality and accurate loss characterization taken in mind. A new iron core design procedure is proposed that may predict core losses when using non-sinusoidal excitation. Experimental results indicate {{that it has a}} promising degree of accuracy. The high <b>frequency</b> <b>candidate</b> is designed using planar integration technology. A topology selection determines that a critical-conduction mode flyback is the most suitable option. Components are added the topology to allow resonant switching for reduced switching losses. Common-mode current arising from good capacitive coupling between windings in the planar coupled inductor is reduced using charge balancing technology. The novelty of the converter lies is in the fact that all passive components, barring the bulk of the input capacitance and the output capacitance, are incorporated into the single planar structure. Finally, a comparison of the inverters is made in the categories of power quality, regulation, efficiency, robustness and applicability to the application. The high frequency inverter is found to promise substantial advantages over the low frequency variety in most of these elements. Dr. I. W. Hofsaje...|$|E

This representation can be shown by a scalogram issued from a complex wavelet transform. The formant <b>frequency</b> <b>candidates</b> are validated as local maxima of scalogram which correspond to wavelet ridges. Then in the proposed algorithm, we have introduced the computation of center of gravity as tracking constraint.

30|$|Most pitch {{estimation}} algorithms {{are either}} {{based on the}} autocorrelation function (ACF), or they work in the frequency domain by applying a spectral analysis of potential fundamental frequencies and their corresponding partials. For both approaches, one big challenge is to pick the correct peak which is particularly difficult for polyphonic music where the detection is disturbed by overlapping partials. In order to solve that issue, several improvements are implemented in the popular YIN algorithm [26] which in fact uses the difference function instead of the ACF. A further extension is the pYIN method which is introduced in [27]. It is a two-stage method which takes past estimations into account. First, for every frame, several fundamental <b>frequency</b> <b>candidates</b> are predicted, and second, the most probable temporal path is estimated, according to a hidden Markov model. In [28], a maximum-likelihood approach is introduced in the frequency domain. Another alternative is a statistical classification approach which is proposed in [29].|$|R

The aim of this master thesis is to analyze radio measurements gathered with a 5 G radio prototype system operating at 15 GHz, which is one of the 5 G <b>frequency</b> <b>candidates.</b> The focus of this thesis is to primarily search for different expected and unexpected radio propagation behaviors by comparing measurement results with existing models and characteristics of existing lower frequency bands. This has been done by modeling the blocking objects using MATLAB and mapping the results of the blocking model with the measurements gathered during the blocking. From the obtained results, it was found that the model response was moving close to the average of the measurement for reasonable estimation of the obstacles’ dimensions. The model was found to be sensitive to the height of the obstacles, especially those near the User Equipment (UE). The knife-edge diffraction model was verified and results were in close agreement with the measurements. The outcome of the channel estimate analysis is that the signal penetration varied behind the studied tree, depending on the density of the foliage. Channel gains for the co-polarized antennas at the Transmission Point (TP) and the UE were found to be 9 dB higher than channel gains for the cross-polarized antennas at the TP and the UE.
