5|$|Alexander H. Smith {{described}} a variety, Calbovista subsculpta var. fumosa, in 1965, {{based on a}} collection he made in Kaniksu National Forest (northeastern Washington) in 1964. This variety, known only from the type locality, differs from the nominate variety in its grayish outer peridium and minute scales. Because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> an invalid genus, it too was invalid; it was later published correctly in 2012 with the full name and authority Calbovista subsculpta var. fumosa A.H.Sm. ex J.C.Coetzee & A.E.van Wyk.|$|E

5|$|Apatosaurus alenquerensis {{was named}} in 1957 by Albert-Félix de Lapparent and Georges Zbyweski. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> post cranial {{material}} from Portugal. In 1990 this material was reassigned to Camarasaurus, but in 1998 {{it was given}} its own genus, Lourinhasaurus. This was further supported by the findings of Tschopp etal. in 2015, where Lourinhasaurus {{was found to be}} sister to Camarasaurus and other camarasaurids.|$|E
5|$|Chōdō-in was a {{rectangular}} walled enclosure situated {{directly to the}} north of the Suzakumon gate in the centre of the southern wall of the Greater Palace. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> Chinese models and followed Chinese architectural styles, and archaeological evidence from earlier capitals shows that this building complex was present in earlier palaces and had a remarkably stable design from the 7th century onwards.|$|E
5|$|Highly {{combustible}} materials that leave little residue, such as wood or coal, {{were thought to}} be made mostly of phlogiston; non-combustible substances that corrode, such as iron, contained very little. Air did not play a role in phlogiston theory, nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea; instead, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> observations of what happens when something burns, that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process.|$|E

5|$|In the {{electromagnetic}} process, {{a magnetic field}} deflected charged particles according to mass. The process was neither scientifically elegant nor industrially efficient. Compared with a gaseous diffusion plant or a nuclear reactor, an electromagnetic separation plant would consume more scarce materials, require more manpower to operate, and cost more to build. Nonetheless, the process was approved because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> proven technology and therefore represented less risk. Moreover, it could be built in stages, and would rapidly reach industrial capacity.|$|E
5|$|Interest in {{the film}} was rekindled when a stage musical called Little Shop of Horrors was {{produced}} in 1982. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the original film and was itself adapted to cinema as Little Shop of Horrors, in 1986. A short-lived animated television series inspired by the musical film, Little Shop, premiered in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Lloyd Lonergan {{wrote the}} {{scenario}} based on S. Bracebridge Hemyng's Jack Harkaway story series. Film historian Q. David Bowers states that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> a stage play {{based upon a}} series of boys' stories, but does not cite a specific credit for which adaptation or work <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on.</b> Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but {{it may have been}} Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory, and Alfred H. Moses, Jr. though none are specifically credited. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters.|$|E

The {{wife of the}} film's {{producer}} owned the only Lipizzans in the US {{at the time that}} the movie was made. The rescue during World War II of the Lipizzan stallions is depicted in the 1963 Walt Disney movie Miracle of the White Stallions. The movie was the only live-action, relatively realistic film set against a World War II backdrop that Disney has ever produced.|$|E
5|$|The National Alliance and Resistance Records {{released}} a similar game, White Law, in June 2003. It starred an Irish-American police officer taking up arms {{to protect his}} territory from racial minorities. It {{has been compared to}} Freedom Fighters, though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the events of Pierce's novel The Turner Diaries. The National Alliance intended to create an entire line of racist games, but no more have surfaced.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} sound film {{created a new}} job market for writers of screen dialogue. Many {{newspaper}} journalists moved to California and became studio-employed screenwriters. This resulted {{in a series of}} fast-talking comedy pictures featuring newsmen. The Front Page, later re-made as the much less cynical and more sentimental post-Code His Girl Friday (1940), was adapted from the Broadway play by Chicago newsmen, and Hollywood screenwriters, Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> Hecht's experiences working as a reporter for the Chicago Daily Journal.|$|E

5|$|The {{localization}} company Latina International, {{which had}} previously worked on Final Fantasy VII, translated the script into English. The town of Silent Hill is {{an interpretation of}} a small American community as imagined by the Japanese team. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> Western literature and films, {{as well as on}} depictions of American towns in European and Russian culture. The game's joke ending came out of a suggestion box created to find alternative reasons for the occurrences in Silent Hill.|$|E
5|$|Theobald Boehm did not {{directly}} invent the key system of the clarinet. Boehm was a flautist who created the key system that is now used for the transverse flute. Klosé and Buffet applied Boehm's system to the clarinet. Although the credit goes to those people, Boehm's name was given to that key system because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> that used for flute.|$|E
5|$|They {{have created}} some dishes and desserts based on {{perfumes}} such as Calvin Klein's Eternity, Carolina Herrera, Lancôme and Bulgari.

The wine list is split into separate lists for red and white, and is delivered on a trolley to each table.|$|E

Scripts were requested, but Hinchcliffe was unhappy with the draft of the first part and ultimately the story was dropped.|$|E
5|$|Written by Chris Boucher, was {{submitted}} {{at some point}} after The Silent Scream had been rejected in early 1975. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> a premise that Hinchcliffe and Holmes wanted to use in which people and machines are controlled by a computer that malfunctions. It was to be set on a space ship which has been home to several generations of a civilization.|$|E
5|$|A made-for-television movie, Farewell to Manzanar, {{directed}} by John Korty, aired on March 11, 1976, on NBC. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the 1973 memoir {{of the same}} name, written by Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston, who was incarcerated at Manzanar as a child, and her husband James D.
