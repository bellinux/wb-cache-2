Each of these orders is {{represented}} in the Miocene epoch: the Eocene formation, as I have already said, contains Cheiroptera, Insectivora, Rodentia, Ungulata, Carnivora, and Cetacea. But the Cheiroptera are extreme modifications of the Insectivora, just as the Cetacea are extreme modifications of the Carnivorous type; and therefore it is to my mind incredible that monodelphous Insectivora and Carnivora {{should not have been}} abundantly developed, along with Ungulata, in the Mesozoic epoch. But if this be the case, how much further back must we go to find the common stock of the monodelphous Mammalia? As to the <b>Didelphia,</b> if we may trust the evidence which seems to be afforded by their very scanty remains, a Hypsiprymnoid form existed at the epoch of the Trias, contemporaneously with a Carnivorous form. At the epoch of the Trias, therefore, the Marsupialia must have already existed long enough to have become differentiated into carnivorous and herbivorous forms. But the Monotremata are lower forms than the <b>Didelphia</b> which last are intercalary between the Ornithodelphia and the Monodelphia. To what point of the Palaeozoic epoch, then, must we, upon any rational estimate, relegate the origin of the Monotremata? ...|$|E
6000|$|That the <b>Didelphia</b> were {{developed}} {{out of some}} ornithodelphous form, as Professor Haeckel supposes, seems to be unquestionable; but the existing Opossums and Kangaroos are certainly extremely modified and remote from their ancestors the [...] "Prodidelphia," [...] of which we have not, at present the slightest knowledge. The mode of origin of the Monodelphia from these {{is a very difficult}} problem, for the most part left open by Professor Haeckel. He considers the Prosimiae, or Lemurs, to be the common stock of the Deciduata, and the Cetacea (with which he includes the Sirenia) to be modified Ungulata. As regards the latter question, I have little doubt that the Sirenia connect the Ungulata with the Proboscidea; and none, that the Cetacea are extremely modified Carnivora. The passage between the Seals and the Cetacea by Zeuglodon is complete. I also think that there is much to be said for the opinion, that the Insectivora represent the common stock of the Primates (which passed into them by the Prosimiae), the Cheiroptera, the Rodentia, and the Carnivora. And I am greatly disposed to look for the common root of all the Ungulata, as well, in some ancient non-deciduate Mammals which were more like Insectivora than anything else. On the other hand, the Edentata appear to form a series by themselves.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{the truth}} which Mr. Darwin {{perceived}} and promulgated as [...] "the {{law of the}} succession of types" [...] is, that, in all these provinces, the animals found in Pliocene or later deposits are closely affined to those which now inhabit the same provinces; and that, conversely, the forms characteristic of other provinces are absent. North and South America, perhaps, present one or two exceptions to the last rule, but they are readily susceptible of explanation. Thus, in Australia, the later Tertiary mammals are marsupials (possibly with exception of the Dog and a Rodent or two, as at present). In Austro-Columbia the later Tertiary fauna exhibits numerous and varied forms of Platyrrhine Apes, Rodents, Cats, Dogs, Stags, Edentata, and Opossums; but, as at present, no Catarrhine Apes, no Lemurs, no Insectivora, Oxen, Antelopes, Rhinoceroses, nor <b>Didelphia</b> other than Opossums. And in the wide-spread Arctogaeal province, the Pliocene and later mammals {{belong to the same}} groups as those which now exist in the province. The law of succession of types, therefore, holds good for the present epoch as compared with its predecessor. Does it equally well apply to the Pliocene fauna when we compare it with that of the Miocene epoch? By great good fortune, an extensive mammalian fauna of the latter epoch has now become known, in four very distant portions of the Arctogaeal province which do not differ greatly in latitude. Thus Falconer and Cautley have made known the fauna of the sub-Himalayas and the Perim Islands; Gaudry that of Attica; many observers that of Central Europe and France; and Leidy that of Nebraska, on the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains. The results are very striking. The total Miocene fauna comprises many genera, and species of Catarrhine Apes, of Bats, of Insectivora; of Arctogaeal types of Rodentia; of Proboscidea; of equine, rhinocerotic, and tapirine quadrupeds; of cameline, bovine, antilopine, cervine, and traguline Ruminants; of Pigs and Hippopotamuses; of Viverridae and Hyaenidae among other Carnivora; with Edentata allied to the Arctogaeal Orycteropus and Manis, and not to the Austro-Columbian Edentates. The only type present in the Miocene, but absent in the existing, fauna of Eastern Arctogaea, is that of the Didelphidae, which, however, remains in North America.|$|E
40|$|Na área rural do município de Teresina-Piauí, foram capturados 129 triatomíneos distribuídos em (a) ecótopos artificiais: habitações (1 Triatoma brasiliensis, 1 Panstrongylus geniculatus, 1 Rhodnius pictipes e 1 Rhodnius prolixusj e galpão abandonado (7 Rhodnius nasutusj e (b) ecótopos naturais: Orbignya martiana (41 Rhodnius neglectus, 33 Rhodnius prolixus e 41 Rhodnius nasutus,) e Copernicia cerifera (3 Rhodnius neglectus,). Cerca de 22, 6 % dos triatomíneos capturados estavam infectados por flagelados, sendo 30 % no ambiente {{artificial}} e 21, 9 % no ambiente natural. Dos 28 mamíferos capturados e examinados, 7 Didelphis aibiventris, 2 Rattus rattus e 1 Tamandua tetradacty la apresentavam-se positivos para flagelados. Os flagelados encontrados nos triatomíneos e nos mamíferos eram semelhantes ao Trypanosoma cruzi. Das 123 reações sorológicas, por imunojluorescência indireta, realizadas na população, duas (1, 6 %) foram reativas. In {{the rural}} areas of Teresina, 129 triatomines were captured distributed in (a) artificial ecotopes; a house with one Triatoma brasiliensis, one Panstrongylus geniqulatus, Rhodniuspictipes, andone Rhodnius prolixus and in a uninhabited chicken house (7 Rhodnius nasutus). (b) Natural ecotopes; Pahus Orbignya martiana (41 Rhodnius neglectus, 33 Rhodnius prolixus and 41 Rhodnius nasutus) and Copernicia cerifera (3 Rhodnius neglectus). The 22. 6 % of captured triatomines were infected by flagellates similar to Trypanosoma cruzi. Twenty eight sylvatic mammals were captured and examined. Seven <b>Didelphia</b> albiventris, 2 Rattus rattus and a Tamandua tetradactyla were infected withjlagellates. The flagellates found in both triatomines and mammals were morphologically indistinguishable from Trypanosoma cruzi. Serology by the indirect immuno fluorescence testfor Chagas disease revealed two positive seroreactions of positivity among 123 inhabitants examined...|$|E
