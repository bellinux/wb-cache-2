5|$|The {{show was}} {{primarily}} filmed using Sony DSR-570 cameras, although special equipment {{was needed for}} some unique footage. For scenes inside the animals' burrows, mini fibre-optic infra-red cameras were employed; wide-angle shots were filmed with a seven-metre crane and a remote-controlled camera platform. An off-camera wireless microphone was also used to record many meerkat vocalizations, only partially audible to cameras' on-board systems. Most filming was done by a single cameraman and a single sound engineer; researchers have required a minimal human presence to avoid stressing the animals. <b>Eye-level</b> shots were difficult to achieve at times, due to the meerkats' small size and the limited height of even the smallest tripods.|$|E
5|$|Sharmishtha Gooptu {{discusses}} {{the idea that}} the idyllic village life portrayed in Pather Panchali represents authentic Bengali village life, which disappeared during the upheavals of Partition in 1947. She suggests that the film seeks to connect an idealised, pre-partition past with the actual present of partitioned Bengal, and that it uses prototypes of rural Bengal to construct an image of the ideal village. In contrast to this idealism, Mitali Pati and Suranjan Ganguly point out how Ray used <b>eye-level</b> shots, natural lighting, long takes and other techniques to achieve realism. Mainak Biswas has written that Pather Panchali comes very close to the concept of Italian neorealism, as it has several passages with no dramatic development, even though the usual realities of life, such as the changing of seasons or the passing of a day, are concretely filmed.|$|E
5|$|Most puzzles {{are located}} on {{recognizable}} <b>eye-level</b> panels scattered around the island, often connected with power cables that light up once a puzzle is solved and guiding the player to the next puzzle. Some puzzles incorporate the game's architecture, such as one that requires the player to view background elements through a semi-transparent puzzle panel to determine the solution. There are also non-obvious puzzles built into the environment itself, requiring the player to find the correct vantage point to complete the puzzle. At any time, the player can engage the maze-drawing mode, which {{is marked by a}} white border on screen. While in this mode, the player's avatar is prevented from moving and instead allows the player to use their controls to trace the path through a presented maze. The mode ends once the player solves the puzzle or cancels the mode. Normally, this mode is activated in front of a panel, moving the player's view directly to the panel to solve it, {{but it can also be}} activated at any other time to engage those puzzles that are based on vantage points. Nearly all puzzles provide immediate feedback if they have been solved correctly or not through sound effects or visual indication.|$|E
25|$|Early DSLRs {{lacked the}} ability to show the optical viewfinder's image on the LCD display – a feature known as live preview. Live preview is useful in {{situations}} where the camera's <b>eye-level</b> viewfinder cannot be used, such as underwater photography where the camera is enclosed in a plastic waterproof case.|$|E
25|$|This safety-glass {{display is}} behind the {{entrance}} door, and set low enough for young children {{to see some of}} the mounted birds at <b>eye-level.</b> It contains garden birds, a wren's nest and a tawny owl. This display plays birdsong recordings, which young children can learn quickly. This serves as an introduction to pishing.|$|E
25|$|The circular-orb {{portion of}} a mature N. clavipes web can be more than 1 meter across, with support strands {{extending}} perhaps many more feet away. In relation to the ground, the webs of adults may be woven anywhere from <b>eye-level</b> upwards high into the tree canopy. The orb web is usually truncated by a top horizontal support strand, giving it an incomplete look.|$|E
25|$|The side aisles are vaulted in stone, {{with a large}} round boss at {{the centre}} of each ribbed vault. Children who, over the years, have crawled into the arched space beneath the pulpit have {{discovered}} another such beautiful carved boss, in miniature and usually unseen. On all the terminals of arches within the buildings are carved heads of saints. Those that are near the confessionals are at <b>eye-level</b> and may be examined for their details.|$|E
25|$|Boudin {{oversaw the}} {{installation}} {{of art in the}} Red Room as well. Boudin preferred a French design aesthetic, which emphasized covering as much wall space as possible with paintings. This scheme was implemented early in 1961, but in early 1962 (after the walls were recovered in silk) Boudin altered this scheme. He now created two rows of paintings, one at <b>eye-level</b> and one above the top of the door frames. This mimicked the look of an art gallery, and was used in many French country manor-houses.|$|E
25|$|In 1931 {{the family}} {{returned}} to San Francisco. Arnautoff's first significant work after returning was a mural {{on the wall}} of his studio, which he opened to the public. Shortly afterward, he completed his first mural commission, for the Palo Alto Medical Clinic in Palo Alto (where he had been a patient) in August of 1932. The unveiling of this mural caused a traffic jam and some controversy, in part because the mural showed a doctor examining a female patient whose bare breasts were at <b>eye-level.</b> Like his other works in the Bay Area, the murals were frescoes.|$|E
25|$|A bouncer is a ball {{aimed to}} pitch {{in the first half}} of the pitch, meaning it has had time to rise sharply to chest or head height by the time it reaches the batsman. This causes two {{problems}} for the batsman who receives the ball. If he or she attempts to play it, their bat will be at <b>eye-level</b> making it difficult for them to watch the ball onto the bat and time their shot correctly. If he or she leaves or misses the ball, it may strike him or her a painful blow on the head or chest and occasionally result in injury. For this reason, bowling spells containing many bouncers are said to be intimidatory bowling.|$|E
25|$|Adults {{have long}} pink legs {{and a long}} thin black bill. They are white below and have black wings and backs. The tail is white with some grey banding. A {{continuous}} area of black extends from the back along the hindneck to the head. There, it forms a cap covering the entire head from the top to just below <b>eye-level,</b> {{with the exception of}} the areas surrounding the bill and a small white spot above the eye. Males have a greenish gloss to the back and wings, particularly in the breeding season. This is less pronounced or absent in females, which have a brown tinge to these areas instead. Otherwise, the sexes look alike.|$|E
25|$|The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Committee on Physical Agents has {{established}} a TLV for UV-C exposure to avoid such skin and eye injuries among those most susceptible. For 254nm UV, this TLV is 6 mJ/cm² over an eight-hour period. The TLV function differs by wavelengths because of variable energy and potential for cell damage. This TLV {{is supported by the}} International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection and is used in setting lamp safety standards by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America. When TUSS was planned, and until quite recently, this TLV was interpreted as if eye exposure in rooms was continuous over eight hours and at the highest <b>eye-level</b> irradiance found in the room. In those highly unlikely conditions, a 6.0 mJ/cm² dose is reached under the ACGIH TLV after just eight hours of continuous exposure to an irradiance of 0.2 μW/cm². Thus, 0.2 μW/cm² was widely interpreted as the upper permissible limit of irradiance at eye height.|$|E
2500|$|Dress center/right/left dress: this command has {{the band}} bring their hands {{together}} at <b>eye-level</b> and {{to turn their}} heads toward the center, right, or left of the block (if one is in the center, one simply puts one's head down). [...] While dressing, the band can adjust the block to have better spacing. [...] No commands other than Ready front (sometimes Eyes front) can be executed while Dressing is in action.|$|E
2500|$|The {{publication}} in Antwerp in 1559 and 1561 of two series {{of a total}} of 48 prints (the Small Landscapes) after drawings by an anonymous artist referred to as the Master of the Small Landscapes signalled a shift away from the imaginary, distant landscapes with religious content of the world landscape towards close-up renderings at <b>eye-level</b> of identifiable country estates and villages populated with figures engaged in daily activities. [...] By abandoning the panoramic viewpoint of the world landscape and focusing on the humble, rural and even topographical, the Small Landscapes set the stage for Netherlandish landscape painting in the 17th century. [...] After the publication of the Small Landscapes, landscape artists in the Low Countries either continued with the world landscape or followed the new mode presented by the Small Landscapes.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 April 1819, a British officer named John K Smith, of the 28th Cavalry, while hunting tiger, [...] "discovered" [...] the {{entrance}} to Cave No. 10 when a local shepherd boy guided him to the location and the door. The caves were well known by locals already. Captain Smith went to a nearby village and asked the villagers {{to come to the}} site with axes, spears, torches and drums, to cut down the tangled jungle growth that made entering the cave difficult. He then vandalised the wall by scratching his name and the date over the painting of a bodhisattva. Since he stood on a five-foot high pile of rubble collected over the years, the inscription is well above the <b>eye-level</b> gaze of an adult today. A paper on the caves by William Erskine was read to the Bombay Literary Society in 1822.|$|E
2500|$|On 2015 Simpson is {{concentrating on}} a new album and {{developing}} a [...] "Live In Session" [...] experience - [...] "a new way to present the music live based around {{the idea of being}} in the centre of the dancefloor and at eye level... I am looking to create a space which mimics the studio environment – not only that – because I would be in the centre of the dancefloor so I can monitor everything around me and be at the same level – <b>eye-level</b> with the presumed dancer. This way it makes it easy for me to create the atmosphere and the rhythm suitable for the individual dancefloor. Kind of like an open kitchen in a restaurant – it’s an open kitchen in a club bringing the food to the people instantly – as soon as it’s produced it’s already on the dancefloor. What I’m looking for in 2015 is sound reproduction in the clubs being taken a lot more seriously than in the past." ...|$|E
2500|$|The larger, {{advanced}} {{digital cameras}} offer a non-optical electronic through-the-lens (TTL) view, via an <b>eye-level</b> electronic viewfinder (EVF) {{in addition to}} the rear LCD. The difference in view compared with a DSLR is that the EVF shows a digitally created image, whereas the viewfinder in a DSLR shows an actual optical image via the reflex viewing system. An EVF image has lag time (that is, it reacts with a delay to view changes) and has a lower resolution than an optical viewfinder but achieves parallax-free viewing using less bulk and mechanical complexity than a DSLR with its reflex viewing system. Optical viewfinders tend to be more comfortable and efficient, especially for action photography and in low-light conditions. Compared with digital cameras with LCD electronic viewfinders, there is no time lag in the image: it is always correct as it is being [...] "updated" [...] at the speed of light. This is important for action or sports photography, or any other situation where the subject or the camera is moving quickly. Furthermore, the [...] "resolution" [...] of the viewed image is much better than that provided by an LCD or an electronic viewfinder, which can be important if manual focusing is desired for precise focusing, as would be the case in macro photography and [...] "micro-photography" [...] (with a microscope). An optical viewfinder may also cause less eye-strain. However, electronic viewfinders may provide a brighter display in low light situations, as the picture can be electronically amplified.|$|E

50|$|A reflex finder is a {{viewfinder}} {{system with}} a mirror placed behind a lens. The light passing through the lens is reflected by the mirror to a focusing screen, usually ground glass. The image formed on this ground glass can be observed directly, giving a waist-level reflex finder, or through a redressing optical device (set of mirrors or prism) for <b>eye-level</b> viewing, giving an <b>eye-level</b> reflex finder.|$|E

50|$|There is {{a unique}} circle passing through {{the top and bottom}} of the {{painting}} and tangent to the <b>eye-level</b> line. By elementary geometry, if the viewer's position were to move along the circle, the angle subtended by the painting would remain constant. All positions on the <b>eye-level</b> line except the point of tangency are outside of the circle, and therefore the angle subtended by the painting from those points is smaller.|$|E

50|$|By Elements III.36 (alternatively the power-of-a-point theorem), the {{distance}} from the wall to the point of tangency is the geometric mean of the heights of {{the top and bottom of}} the painting. This means, in turn, that if we reflect the bottom of the picture in the line at <b>eye-level</b> and draw the circle with the segment between the top of the picture and this reflected point as diameter, the circle intersects the line at <b>eye-level</b> in the required position (by Elements II.14).|$|E
5000|$|... 1947: Rectaflex (Italy): first SLR camera {{equipped}} with a pentaprism for <b>eye-level</b> viewing. The first prototype of the Rectaflex was presented by Telemaco Corsi at the Milano Fair in April 1947. It was a wooden mock-up, with a mirror <b>eye-level</b> finder. This first prototipe used a five-facet roof optic prism giving a left to right inverted image. For vertical pictures, the image was upside down, {{and that was a}} big drawback. This was corrected with a Goulier prism before the 1948 Milano Fair.|$|E
