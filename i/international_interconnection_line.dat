The proposed action is the issuance of Presidential Permit PP- 89 by DOE to Bangor Hydro-Electric Company to construct and operate a new <b>international</b> transmission <b>line</b> <b>interconnection</b> to New Brunswick, Canada that would consist of an 83. 8 mile (US portion), 345 -kilovolt (kV) alternating current transmission line from the US-Canadian border at Baileyville, Maine to an existing substation at Orrington, Maine. The principal environmental impacts of the construction and operation of the transmission line would be incremental in nature and would include the conversion of forested uplands (mostly commercial timberlands) and wetlands to right-of-way (small trees, shrubs, and herbaceous vegetation). The proposed line would also result in localized minor to moderate visual impacts and would contribute a minor incremental increase in the exposure of some individuals to electromagnetic fields.

40|$|Nowadays each Independent System Operator {{checks that}} in the <b>interconnection</b> <b>lines</b> the {{scheduled}} power flows do not exceed the operating limits. These limits are generally fixed to ensure a given level of security in the power system.

40|$|Abstract — Fast delay {{estimation}} methods, {{as compared}} to simulation techniques, are needed for incremental performance-driven layout synthesis. On-chip inductive and conductive effects are becoming predominant in deep submicron (DSM) interconnects due to increasing clock speeds; circuit complexity and interconnect lengths. Inductance causes noise in the signal waveforms, which can adversely affect {{the performance of the}} circuit and signal integrity. Elmore delay-based estimation methods, although efficient, fails to accurately estimate the delay for RLCG interconnect lines. This paper presents an analytical delay model, based on first and second moments of RLCG <b>interconnection</b> <b>lines,</b> that considers the effect of inductance and conductance for the estimation of delay in <b>interconnection</b> <b>lines.</b> Simulation results justify the efficacy of the proposed delay modelling approach...|$|R

40|$|AbstractNowadays {{there are}} a lot of demands for the {{renewable}} energy generation because fossil fuel is being exhausted. The size of renewable plant has a tendency to be increased for economic reasons. So the high voltage level facilities are necessary for interconnection between power grid and renewable plant. The interconnection facilities should have a transmission capacity enough to transfer the peak power generated by renewable plant. However, the output of renewable has an intermittent characteristic and its variation range is not small. Therefore an average utilization ratio of <b>interconnection</b> <b>line</b> between is low because of the power fluctuation from renewable plant. The High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) cable is able to transmit a large amount of electricity without additional power facility. In this paper, an advantage of using HTS cable as an <b>interconnection</b> <b>line</b> between power grid and renewable plant are analyzed...|$|R

40|$|Novel {{insights}} {{regarding the}} ability of encapsulated metal interconnections to deform due to bending are presented. Encapsulated metal interconnections are used as electric conductor or measurement system within {{a wide range of}} applications fields, e. g. biomedical, wearable, textile applications. Nevertheless the mechanical analysis remains limited to reliability investigation of these configurations. Different papers and research groups claim that meander-shaped metal interconnections are predisposed for these applications fields due to their deformability while, to the author’s knowledge, no reports are found about this ability. An analysis based on the work needed to bend interconnections to a certain curvature will be used to compare different interconnection configurations with each other. The experimental as well as the simulation setup is based on PDMS encapsulated PI-enhanced Cu tracks. The results and conclusions are specific for this type of interconnections, but can be extended to a global conclusion about stretchable interconnections. From the obtained insights it is proven that periodically meander-shaped interconnections need significant less work, up to more than 10 times less, to bend the interconnection to the same curvature compared to straight <b>interconnection</b> <b>lines.</b> Furthermore it shows out, for the meander-shaped interconnection, that per increase of 250 µm encapsulation thickness the work raises with a factor 2. For straight <b>interconnection</b> <b>lines</b> the work in function of the encapsulation thickness is limited to 20 %/ 250 µm. The bendability of the straight <b>interconnection</b> <b>lines</b> is determined by the shape of the interconnection, where for meandered tracks the encapsulation will determine this factor, for an encapsulation thickness of maximum 1 mm. For encapsulations > 1 mm, the encapsulation thickness will become the predominant factor which determines the deformability for both interconnection shapes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-For {{restoration}} of grasp in disabled people {{by means of}} functional electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves, 18 polar Hybrid Cuff Electrodes were developed. These electrodes consisted of a micromachined polyimide-based thin-film structure with integrated electrode contacts and <b>interconnection</b> <b>lines</b> which was glued to a silicone cuff. <b>Interconnection</b> <b>lines</b> were made of only 300 nm of sputtered gold, which led to high line drops. Gold electroplating was used to thicken the lines to 3 µm, which reduced the mean track resistance from 480 W to 10 W. Furthermore, the electrode material was changed from sputtered platinum to electroplated platinum black in order to decrease the phase border impedance of stimulation sites. Applying these techniques, the overall electrode impedance could be reduced from 7. 78 kW to 624 W (at 1 kHz). Additional to the electrical optimization of the cuff electrodes, mechanical properties were enhanced by changing the method of joining silicone and polyimide from using one part silicone adhesive to plasma activation of surfaces: Plasma-treated surfaces were simply pressed face to face. The result was a bondage without any additional layer of glue, {{which led to a}} very high mechanical flexibility and higher yield of the overall Hybri...|$|R
