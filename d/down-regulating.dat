5|$|The α-chemokine SDF-1, a ligand for CXCR4, {{suppresses}} {{replication of}} T-tropic HIV-1 isolates. It does this by <b>down-regulating</b> {{the expression of}} CXCR4 {{on the surface of}} these cells. HIV that use only the CCR5 receptor are termed R5; those that use only CXCR4 are termed X4, and those that use both, X4R5. However, the use of coreceptor alone does not explain viral tropism, as not all R5 viruses are able to use CCR5 on macrophages for a productive infection and HIV can also infect a subtype of myeloid dendritic cells, which probably constitute a reservoir that maintains infection when CD4+ T cell numbers have declined to extremely low levels.|$|E

25|$|The {{mechanism}} behind increasing HDL is {{not totally}} understood {{but it seems}} to be done in various ways. Niacin increases apolipoprotein A1 levels due to anti catabolic effects resulting in higher reverse cholesterol transport. It also inhibits HDL hepatic uptake, <b>down-regulating</b> production of the cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) gene. Finally, it stimulates the ABCA1 transporter in monocytes and macrophages and up-regulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ results in reverse cholesterol transport.|$|E

40|$|Mycotoxins {{produced}} by fungal species commonly contaminate livestock feedstuffs, jeopardizing {{their health and}} diminishing production. Citrinin (CIT) and ochratoxin A (OTA) are mycotoxins {{produced by}} Penicillium spp. and commonly co-occur. Both CIT and OTA can modulate immune response by inhibiting cell proliferation and differentiation, altering cell metabolism, and triggering programmed cell death. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of sublethal exposure (i. e., the concentration that inhibited cell proliferation by 25 % (IC 25)) to CIT, OTA or CIT + OTA on the bovine macrophage transcriptome. Gene expression was determined using the Affymetrix Bovine Genome Array. After 6 h of exposure to CIT, OTA or CIT + OTA, the number of differentially expressed genes (DEG), respectively, was as follows: 1471 genes (822 up-regulated, 649 <b>down-regulated),</b> 5094 genes (2611 up-regulated, 2483 <b>down-regulated)</b> and 7624 genes (3984 up-regulated, 3640 <b>down-regulated).</b> Of these, 179 genes (88 up-regulated, 91 <b>down-regulated)</b> were commonly expressed between treatments. After 24 h of exposure to CIT, OTA or CIT + OTA the number of DEG, respectively, was as follows: 3230 genes (1631 up-regulated, 1599 <b>down-regulated),</b> 8558 genes (4167 up-regulated, 4391 <b>down-regulated),</b> and 10, 927 genes (6284 up-regulated, 4643 <b>down-regulated).</b> Of these, 770 genes (247 up-regulated, 523 <b>down-regulated)</b> were commonly expressed between treatments. The categorization of common biological functions and pathway analysis suggests that the IC 25 of both CIT and OTA, or their combination, induces cellular oxidative stress, a slowing of cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. Collectively, these effects contribute to inhibiting bovine macrophage proliferation...|$|R

25|$|Both helper and {{cytotoxic}} T-cells {{can control}} viral infections by secreting interferons. Cytotoxic T cells usually kill virally infected cells. However, {{they can also}} be stimulated to secrete antiviral cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, which do not kill the cell, but limit viral infection by <b>down-regulating</b> the expression of viral components. DNA vaccinations can be used to curb viral infections by non-destructive IFN-mediated control. This was demonstrated for hepatitis B. IFN-γ is critically important in controlling malaria infections and is a consideration for anti-malarial DNA vaccines.|$|E
25|$|Differences in {{response}} to treatment between HPV-OPC and HPV+OPC may include differences in the extent and manner in which cellular growth-regulatory pathways are altered in the two forms of OPC. For instance in HPV+OPC the HPV E6 and E7 oncogenes merely render the p53 and pRb pathways dormant, leaving open the possibility of reactivation of these pathways by <b>down-regulating</b> (reducing) expression of the oncogenes. This {{is in contrast to}} the mutant form of p53 found in HPV-OPC that is associated with treatment resistance. Furthermore, it is suggested that the effects of E6 and E7 on these pathways renders the tumour more radiosensitive, possibly by interference with mechanisms such as DNA repair, repopulation signalling, and cell-cycle redistribution. The microenvironment is also important, with radiation increasing host immune response to viral antigens expressed on the tumour. Also, there is an association between an increase in tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and in circulating white blood cells in HPV+OPC patients and better prognosis. This implies a role for an adaptive immune system in suppressing tumour progression.|$|E
25|$|Amastigotes of L. donovani enter macrophages via a Rac1- and Arf6-dependent process, and {{are found}} in {{phagocytic}} vacuoles that interact with endosomes and lysosomes and acquire lysosomal features. During phagocytosis by macrophages, the promastigotes inhibit {{the formation of the}} phagolysosome, a cellular product by which invading pathogens are removed. The promastigote can do this using its glycolipid lipophosphoglycan (LPG) on its cell membrane. LPG causes disorganisation of F-actin and disruption of phagosomal lipid microdomains. They are capable of evading the microbicidal actions of macrophages, which can kill ordinary pathogens using reactive nitrogen and oxygen intermediates. They effectively subvert the production of reactive oxygen species. In this way the amastigotes are able to survive and replicate inside these primary immune systems. The parasites manipulate the cell signalling pathway of the macrophages, such as <b>down-regulating</b> of Jak/stat signalling, NO and TNF-α production, and also by blocking the NF-κB-dependent pathway. There are two major mechanisms of immune evasion such as induction of immune suppressive IL-10 responses and the generation of poor and functionally impaired CD8(+) T-cell responses.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{believed}} that estrogen and progesterone have a mitogenic effect on leiomyoma cells and also act by influencing (directly and indirectly) {{a large number of}} growth factors, cytokines and apoptotic factors as well as other hormones. Furthermore, the actions of estrogen and progesterone are modulated by the cross-talk between estrogen, progesterone and prolactin signaling which controls the expression of the respective nuclear receptors. It {{is believed}} that estrogen promotes growth by up-regulating IGF-1, EGFR, [...] TGF-beta1, TGF-beta3 and PDGF, and promotes aberrant survival of leiomyoma cells by <b>down-regulating</b> p53, increasing expression of the anti-apoptotic factor PCP4 and antagonizing PPAR-gamma signaling. Progesterone is thought to promote the growth of leiomyoma through up-regulating EGF, TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta3, and promotes survival through up-regulating Bcl-2 expression and <b>down-regulating</b> TNF-alpha. Progesterone is believed to counteract growth by downregulating IGF-1. Expression of transforming growth interacting factor (TGIF) is increased in leiomyoma compared with myometrium. TGIF is a potential repressor of TGF-β pathways in myometrial cells.|$|E

[...] A T cell becomes a CD4+ cell by <b>down-regulating</b> expression of its CD8 cell surface receptors. [...] If the cell does not lose its signal, {{it will continue}} downregulating CD8 and become a CD4+, single positive cell.

40|$|To {{characterize}} {{the changes in}} global gene expression in the distal colon of constipated SD rats {{in response to the}} laxative effects of aqueous extracts of Liriope platyphylla (AEtLP), including isoflavone, saponin, oligosaccharide, succinic acid and hydroxyproline, the total RNA extracted from the distal colon of AEtLP-treated constipation rats was hybridized to oli-gonucleotide microarrays. The AEtLP treated rats showed {{an increase in the number}} of stools, mucosa thickness, flat luminal surface thickness, mucin secretion, and crypt num-ber. Overall, compared to the controls, 581 genes were up-regulated and 216 genes were <b>down-regulated</b> by the constipation induced by loperamide in the constipated rats. After the AEtLP treatment, 67 genes were up-regulated and 421 genes were <b>down-regulated.</b> Among the transcripts up-regulated by constipation, 89 were significantly <b>down-regulated</b> and 22 were recovered to the normal levels by the AEtLP treatment.

30|$|Bayesian method (Audic and Claverie, 1997) {{was applied}} to {{identify}} the miRNAs whose expression may have changed. This method was originally designed to analyze differentially expressed genes through sequencing of their cDNA clones and has also been used to analyze small RNA sequencing data (Morin et al., 2008). In the SH-SY 5 Y cell line, TDP- 43 knockdown resulted in 98 differentially expressed miRNAs (P-value < 0.001), of which 68 miRNAs were <b>down-regulated.</b> Of these 98 miRNAs, 2 miRNAs were up-regulated and 14 <b>down-regulated</b> after TDP- 43 knockdown in the SNB- 19 and HT 22 cell lines. All of the differentially expressed miRNAs across the three cell lines are listed in Table S 2.

40|$|Many {{mammalian}} transcripts contain target {{sites for}} multiple miRNAs, {{although it is}} not clear to what extent miRNAs may coordi-nately regulate single genes. We have mapped the interactions between <b>down-regulated</b> miRNAs and overexpressed tar-get protein-coding genes in murine and hu-man lymphomas. Myc, one of the hallmark oncogenes in these lymphomas, stands out as the up-regulated gene with the highest number of genetic interactions with <b>down-regulated</b> miRNAs in mouse lymphomas. The regulation of Myc by several of these miRNAs is confirmed by cellular and re-porter assays. The same approach iden-tifies MYC and multiple Myc targets as a preferential target of <b>down-regulated</b> miRNAs in human Burkitt lymphoma, a pa-thology characterized by translocated MYC oncogenes.

The published article is copyrighted by Springer {{and can be found}} at: [URL] Endogenous levels and signaling of gibberellin plant hormones such as gibberellic acid (GA) have been genetically <b>down-regulated</b> to create semi-dwarf varieties of poplar. The potential benefits of semi-dwarf stature include reduced risk of wind damage, improved stress tolerance, and improved wood quality. Despite these benefits, modification of growth traits may have consequences for non-target traits that confer defense against insect herbivores. According to the growth-differentiation balance hypothesis, reductions in growth may shift allocation of carbon from growth to chemical resistance traits, thereby altering plant defense. To date, host-plant suitability and pest response have not been comprehensively evaluated in GA <b>down-regulated</b> plants. We quantified chemical resistance and nitrogen (an index of protein) in GA <b>down-regulated</b> and wild-type poplar (Populus alba × P. tremula) genotypes.
