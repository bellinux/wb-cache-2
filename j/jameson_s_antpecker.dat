40|$|Studies of mucins {{suggest that}} the {{structural}} effects of O-glycans are restricted to steric interactions between peptide-linked GalNAc residues and adjacent polypeptide residues. It has been proposed, however, that differential O-glycan sialylation alters {{the structure of the}} stalk-like region of the T cell co-receptor, CD 8, and that this, in turn, modulates ligand binding (Daniels, M. A., Devine, L., Miller, J. D., Moser, J. M., Lukacher, A. E., Altman, J. D., Kavathas, P., Hogquist, K. A., and <b>Jameson,</b> <b>S.</b> C. (2001) Immunity 15, 1051 - 1061; Moody, A. M., Chui, D., Reche, P. A., Priatel, J. J., Marth, J. D., and Reinherz, E. L. (2001) Cell 107, 501 - 512). We characterize the glycosylation of soluble, chimeric forms of the alphaalpha- and alphabeta-isoforms of murine CD 8 containing the O-glycosylated stalk of rat CD 8 alphaalpha, and we show that the stalk O-glycans are differentially sialylated in CHO K 1 versus Lec 3. 2. 8. 1 cells (82 versus approximately 6 %, respectively). Sedimentation analysis indicates that the Perrin functions, Pexp, which reflect overall molecular shape, are very similar (1. 61 versus 1. 54), whereas the sedimentation coefficients (s) of the CHO K 1 - and Lec 3. 2. 8. 1 -derived proteins differ considerably (3. 73 versus 3. 13 S). The hydrodynamic properties of molecular models also strongly imply that the sialylated and non-sialylated forms of the chimera have parallel, equally highly extended stalks (approximately 2. 6 A/residue). Our analysis indicates that, {{as in the case of}} mucins, the overall structure of O-glycosylated stalk-like peptides is sialylation-independent and that the functional effects of differential CD 8 O-glycan sialylation need careful interpretation...|$|R

40|$|In the {{cellular}} immune response, recognition by CTL-TCRs of viral antigens presented as peptides by HLA class I molecules, triggers {{destruction of the}} virally infected cell (Townsend, A. R. M., J. Rothbard, F. M. Gotch, G. Bahadur, D. Wraith, and A. J. McMichael. 1986. Cell. 44 : 959 - 968). Altered peptide ligands (APLs) which antagonise CTL recognition of infected cells have been reported (<b>Jameson,</b> <b>S.</b> C., F. R. Carbone, and M. J. Bevan. 1993. J. Exp. Med. 177 : 1541 - 1550). In one example, lysis of antigen presenting cells by CTLs in response to recognition of an HLA B 8 -restricted HIV- 1 P 17 (aa 24 - 31) epitope can be inhibited by naturally occurring variants of this peptide, which act as TCR antagonists (Klenerman, P., S. Rowland Jones, S. McAdam, J. Edwards, S. Daenke, D. Lalloo, B. Koppe, W. Rosenberg, D. Boyd, A. Edwards, P. Giangrande, R. E. Phillips, and A. McMichael. 1994. Nature (Lond.). 369 : 403 - 407). We have characterised two CTL clones and a CTL line whose interactions with these variants of P 17 (aa 24 - 31) exhibit a variety of responses. We have examined the high resolution crystal structures of four of these APLs in complex with HLA B 8 to determine alterations in the shape, chemistry, and local flexibility of the TCR binding surface. The variant peptides cause changes in the recognition surface by three mechanisms: changes contributed directly by the peptide, effects transmitted to the exposed peptide surface, and induced effects on the exposed framework of the peptide binding groove. While the first two mechanisms frequently lead to antagonism, the third has more profound effects on TCR recognition...|$|R

With the rise of Afrikaner nationalism in the twentieth century the perception that L. <b>S.</b> <b>Jameson</b> (1853 - 1917) was the cause of all tension and rivalry between the two white groups became entrenched. And yet, Jameson as leader of the Unionist Party between 1910 and 1912 did his utmost to atone for the damage done by his reckless Raid. He publicly lauded Botha’s ability and integrity and this {{played a crucial role in}} diluting the anti-Afrikaner attitude of many English-speakers, convincing them to accept an Afrikaner dominated government. In addition his encouragement of a South African identity within the Empire, and his restraint on the anger and opposition to bilingualism by English-speakers supported Botha’s conciliation and nation building policies.

40|$|Convergence theorists explore/predict {{the fusion}} {{of a series of}} {{previously}} discrete forms, a process that might be viewed as un-problematically centripetal. This is the longstanding view of the information industry. It produces a particular outcome - there may be local difficulties, but the perceived ontology of information is towards total convergence. Focussing on the socio-cultural diffusion of information cultural theorists have offered a different account of technical convergence where the stress has been on the centrifugal as much as the centripetal, so that not only what is pushed together through information but also what is forced apart, becomes significant. <b>Jameson?s</b> 1980 <b>s</b> account of schizophrenia as the cultural logic of information capitalism is an example of this ? and is written about the same time Negroponte set about founding/defining future media at MIT. Forcing these different accounts into relation with each other is productive, revealing lacunae not only in technical accounts of convergence but in critical accounts of informational culture, and exposing a naturalized set of alignments which might be questioned; to read the centrifugal moment of convergence as the technological moment and as the enlargement of a form of social control, and the centripetal moment as the cultural moment and as a form of evasion of control, can be problematic. In this context this article (i) explores the contemporary relationship between ? 2. 0 ? (read as essentially industrial account of convergence) and Henry Jenkins? account of convergence culture as post-resistance culture and (ii) explores the potential for understanding contemporary convergence processes and the forms of participation they entail across a series of axes which together might provide a different and more multi-dimensional form of mapping...|$|R
50|$|On 18 February Sir Gordon Sprigg {{resigned}} and was succeeded by Dr L. <b>S.</b> <b>Jameson,</b> who formed a ministry wholly British in character. The first {{task of the}} new government was to introduce (on 4 March) an Additional Representation Bill, to rectify - in part - the disparity in electoral power of the rural and urban districts. Twelve new seats in the House of Assembly were divided among the larger towns, and three members were added to the legislative council. The town voter being mainly British, the bill met with the bitter opposition of the Bond members, who declared that its object was the extinction of their parliamentary power. In fact, the bill was called for by the glaring anomalies in the distribution of seats by which a minority of voters in the country districts returned a majority of members, and it left the towns still inadequately represented. The bill was supported by two or three Dutch members, who were the object of violent attack by the Bondsmen. It became law, and the elections for the additional seats were held in July, after the close of the session. They resulted in strengthening the Progressive majority both in the House of Assembly and in the legislative council - where the Progressives previously had a majority of one only.|$|R
40|$|Nelson, <b>Jameson</b> K. M. <b>S.,</b> Purdue University, May 2012. Acoustic Emission Detection of Metals and Alloys During Machining Operations. Major Professor: Rodney G. Handy. Practical {{correlation}} between material deformation attributes and theoretical concepts of machining has proven difficult to attain. The {{purpose of this}} study was to further explore trends and relationships using acoustic emission detection of materials undergoing single-point lathe turning machine processes. The majority of machining experiments that incorporate acoustic emissions focuses on tool degradation for the purposes of optimizing consumables required to manufacture mechanical devices. Experiments were implemented varying recording location, mechanical barrier condition, and machine parameters. The research focused on machining metal alloys of tantalum tungsten, nitronic 33 stainless steel, M 42 tool steel, and 6061 aluminum. Variation of machine parameters included the alteration to depth of cut, coolant flow rate, cutting velocity, and feed rate of tooling. It was found that, by using capacitive microphone transducer technology, it is difficult to confidently discern the type material undergoing machine processes from significant distances. Structural spectrogram “acoustic mapping” using discrete Fourier transform based methods presented promise in uniquely identifying the type material being machined. Integral calculus methods of summation were implemented to determine the energy released during machine processes. Hypotheses proved that as stand-off distance increased and mechanical barriers were imposed detection of acoustic emissions varied in confidence. The alteration of machine parameters had varying effects on the detection of acoustic emissions. The experiments are discussed in a practical context for discovering as much about machining processes as possible...|$|R
50|$|Train {{collected}} printed books, manuscripts, photographs, maps, artifacts, and artwork on African exploration, big-game hunting, natural history, {{and wildlife}} conservation, dating {{primarily from the}} nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In 2004, the Russell E. Train Africana Collection was acquired by the Smithsonian Institution Libraries, where it is housed in the Joseph F. Cullman 3rd Library of Natural History in Washington, D.C. The collection includes correspondence, drafts of publications, diaries, account books, ephemera, posters, news-clippings, biographies, memoirs, portraits, and the former personal property of selected explorers, big game hunters, missionaries, pioneers, and naturalists in Africa. The Train Collection is particularly strong in archival materials on the following topics: {{the search for the}} source of the Nile and the progress of other exploring expeditions in Africa; the collecting of specimens of African animals, plants, and ethnological materials for zoos and museums (including a significant body of correspondence and photographs from the Smithsonian African Expedition in 1909-1910, led by President Theodore Roosevelt); and the growth of the African wildlife conservation movement. Besides Roosevelt, the major persons represented in the Train Africana Collection include the journalist and explorer Henry Morton Stanley and members of his Emin Pasha Relief Expedition (Thomas Heazle Parke, Robert H. Nelson, James <b>S.</b> <b>Jameson,</b> John Rose Troup, William Bonny, William Grant Stairs, Edmund Musgrave Barttelot, and Arthur J. M.

40|$|Many {{methods of}} {{dominance}} rank ordination were recently reviewed by de Vries (1998). Overall, {{two types of}} method for finding a dominance rank order can be distinguished. In one group of methods some numerical criterion, calculated for the dominance matrix as a whole, is minimized (or maximized) resulting in a reorganized matrix for which this criterion is smallest (or largest). The result produced by each of these methods is a rank order of the individuals, that is, the most plausible one relative to the specific criterion used, and given the dominance encounters observed. This group includes methods developed by Slater (1961), de Vries (1998), McMahan & Morris (1984), Brown (1975), Bossuyt (1990), Crow (1990) and Boyd & Silk (1983). The second class of methods aims to provide a suitable measure of individual overall success in the group, from which a rank order can be directly derived. Measures that have been put forward for this purpose include: number of individuals dominated; proportion of total encounters won; Clutton-Brock et al. s (1979) index of fighting success; David s (1987, 1988) score; and <b>Jameson</b> et al. <b>s</b> (1999) score. As yet, however, none of these success measures appears to be generally accepted (see also de Vries & Appleby 2000). All these methods start by observing behaviour for {{a certain period of}} time after which the outcomes of the dominance encounters are arranged in a matrix. When sufficient interactions between the contestants have been observed, a rank ordination method is used that yields a dominance order that is presumed to have existed during the whole observation period. Basically this means that it is assumed that specific interactions between two individuals reflect the dominance order rather than influence it. In this paper we present the Elo-rating method which provides sequential estimations of individual dominance strengths based on the actual sequence of dominance interactions. From the values of the individual Elo-ratings an estimated rank order can be derived at any moment in time. Elo-rating was developed and subsequently named after Arpad Elo (1961, 1978). It is intended and still used as a fair method for ranking chess players. The Elo-rating calculation procedure is based on the assumption that the chance of A winning from B is a function of the difference in current ratings of the two contestants. After each contest the Elo-ratings of the two contestants are updated in proportion to the deviation of the actual outcome (win, loss or tie) from the expected outcome for each of the two contestants. The expected outcome for a contestant is based on the rating difference of the two contestants at the moment of the contest. The winner s rating increases (and the loser s rating decreases) in proportion to the deviation from the expected outcome. As outstanding features of the Elo-rating method in comparison to other methods of estimating dominance strength, we mention that it is independent of the number of contestants (which may vary over time), it takes the sequence of interactions into account, and gives a continuous update so that the process of dominance strength acquisition can be followed from interaction to interaction. Our main aim is to present Elo-rating as a method for the sequential estimation of dominance strengths. However, from a different perspective it is also possible to consider the Elo-rating updating process as a model of the way in which dominance is generated within a group. The underlying model here is based on the positive (negative) reinforcement of some internal variable when an individual wins (loses) a dominance interaction. We also briefly discuss the application of Elo-rating in a simulation modelling context...|$|R
