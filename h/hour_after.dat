40|$|The {{relevance}} of circadian rhythms in irinotecan and oxaliplatin tolerability was investigated {{with regard to}} antitumour activity. Mice bearing Glasgow osteosarcoma (GOS) received single agent irinotecan (50 or 60 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 per day) or oxaliplatin (4 or 5. 25 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 per day) at one of six dosing times expressed in <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> light onset (3, 7, 11, 15, 19 or 23 <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> light onset). Irinotecan (50 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 per day) and oxaliplatin (4 or 5. 25 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 per day) were given 1 [*]min apart at 7 or 15 <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> light onset, or at their respective times of best tolerability (7 <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> light onset for irinotecan and 15 <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> light onset for oxaliplatin) or worst tolerability (15 <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> light onset for irinotecan and 7 <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> light onset for oxaliplatin). Tumour growth rate was nearly halved and per cent increase in estimated life span (% ILS) was – doubled in the mice receiving irinotecan at 7 <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> light onset as compared to 15 <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> light onset (P< 0. 05).

40|$|ABSTRACTIntroduction:Several studies already {{reported}} {{the response of}} many biomarkers after strength training, but studies using low cost diagnostic imaging tools are rare. Objective:To evaluate the usage of skin temperature and muscle thickness (MT) to monitor muscle response (until 96 <b>hours</b> <b>after)</b> to high-intensity strength training. Methods:This is a short-term longitudinal study with 13 trained, healthy male volunteers. Volunteers performed five sets of biceps bi-set exercise with their dominant arm with dumbbells, with load of 70 % of one-repetition maximum (1 RM). The ultrasound (US) and thermal images were acquired before and immediately after the last set, 24, 48, 72 and 96 <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> exercise. Results:The analysis was divided in two stages: acute muscle response (until 24 <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> training) and delayed muscle response (from 24 to 96 <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> training). The elbow flexors thickness showed the peak value immediately after the last set of training. Skin temperature (on elbow flexors) and the elbow flexors thickness grew continuously from 24 to 96 <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> strength training. There is a high correlation (r= 0. 941, p= 0. 017) between skin temperature and muscle thickness {{from the end of}} exercise until 96 <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> strength training. Conclusions:The US images showed high sensibility for muscle physiological changes on the first 24 <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> exercise.

The effects of adrenal suppression causing hypoglycemia are needed by patient. It can supress the increasing of blood glucose levels resulting from stress respons to surgery. This study to prove the effects of etomidate that cause decreasing on blood glucose levels Methods: Design of this study is pre and post test one group design on 15 patients who are undergoing surgery with general anesthesia based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.
