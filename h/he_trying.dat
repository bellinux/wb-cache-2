25|$|There follow angry exchanges {{among the}} three, Norma declaring Pollione to be a traitor; <b>he</b> <b>trying</b> to persuade Adalgisa {{to leave with}} him; and she angrily telling him to go away. When he {{declares}} that it is his fate to leave Norma, she encourages the young priestess to go with him, but the latter declares that she would rather die. Norma then demands that her lover go, leaving behind his children—and his honour. (Finale: brief duet, Adalgisa and Pollione: he declares his love, and she her desire to Norma {{not to be the}} cause of grief to her. Trio: Norma continues to rage at Pollione, Adalgisa repeats her desire to make him return to Norma, and Pollione curses the day when he met Norma.) Then the sound of the Druids calling Norma to the temple is heard. They report that the angry god, Irminsul, has spoken. Pollione storms out.|$|E
500|$|Zombie's {{intention}} was to reinvent Michael Myers because, in his opinion, the character, along with Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, and Pinhead, had become more familiar to audiences, and as a result, less scary. The idea behind the new film was to delve deeper into Michael's back story and add [...] "new life" [...] to the character. Michael's mask will be given its own story, to provide an explanation {{as to why he}} wears it, instead of having the character simply steal a random mask from a hardware store, as in the original film. Zombie explained that he wanted Michael to be true to what a psychopath really is, and wanted the mask to be a way for Michael to hide. He also wanted the young Michael to have charisma, which would be projected onto the adult Michael. In addition, he decided that Michael's motives for returning to Haddonfield would be more ambiguous, explaining, [...] "as <b>he</b> <b>trying</b> to kill Laurie, or just find her because he loves her?" ...|$|E
500|$|Ideas {{alluding}} to romance are prevalent throughout the episode. The development between Shane Walsh and Lori Grimes continues in [...] "TS-19", which showcases a flashback featuring Shane being conflicted {{with the decision}} to leave an unconscious Rick Grimes in the hospital—who Shane initially presumes to be dead. Kirkman asserted that the sequence added dimension to the storyline, and concluded that by {{the ending of the}} episode, the audience will no longer identify Shane as an antagonist. [...] "Up until the sixth episode, you get the sense that Shane actually is a bad guy, that he lied to Lori and made her believe that he was dead in order to facilitate him moving in on her," [...] said Kirkman. [...] "The flashback does a great job of telling you that that's not true: He tried to save Rick, he wanted to save Rick. He was kind of up against the wall there and actually did believe that Rick was dead." [...] Lincoln said of the flashback: [...] "You realize Shane's loyalty as a friend and as a man—and also his weaknesses. He still can't make a decision without his partner, and you realize he's flawed—everybody is under incredible duress, you see the state of the world is so extreme and terrifying that people are making split-second decisions under great duress. Is Shane barricading Rick in, or is <b>he</b> <b>trying</b> to prevent him being taken by the walkers? There are many different ways to construe what Shane has done and that's the beauty of the show is that there's no clear and definite answers, you make your own mind." [...] Other themes prominent in the episode include suicide and terror.|$|E

500|$|In June 2009, co-writer and {{producer}} of the song, Xavier [...] "Zaytoven" [...] Dotson revealed to MTV News that he worked with Usher on a song. Zaytoven divulged a few details, saying, [...] "I can't wait for {{something like that to}} come out, so people can see I do more than just hip-hop. I can do R, pop, gospel ... whatever genre of music that's out. If you listen to , you can't say, 'Zaytoven did that.'" [...] According to Zaytoven in another interview with MTV News, the track was originally called [...] "Filing Papers". Zaytoven said, [...] "This is before there were any reports about Usher's marriage in the news. So I was thinking to myself, 'Is <b>he</b> <b>trying</b> to say something?' I don't know what Usher is going through, but Sean Garrett made a song about filling out papers, divorce papers. The beat, it's got a bounce to it. It's outta here." [...] Sean Garrett later clarified, stating that the song was not necessarily called [...] "Filing Papers", Garret commented, [...] "Let's say I wrote a record for Usher three or four months ago where I really didn't have any idea of what he was going through personally. I work really hard at creating records I feel that's gonna fit like a glove to an artist. Me and Usher have a close relationship; I tend to sort of assist certain artists in giving them a direction, where I think they need to go in their next move. I felt that was the direction we needed to go. I felt that was the question everyone wanted to know: Was [...] good or was it bad? Was it right? Are you happy or you're not?" [...] Garrett continued to maintain that he had no idea of Usher's state of marriage {{during the time of the}} song's development, stating that the record could have meant anything, saying, [...] "I'm a heavy believer in God. I'm a Pisces. My intuition is crazy. I think that's healthy in the process for me writing and producing for people. Maybe it was a sign of what my man was going through and he needed to get out. Maybe it was something she needed to hear as a wake-up call to her." ...|$|E
