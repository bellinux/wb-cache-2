5|$|The Leigh Hospital Board bought Damhouse in 1893 {{for use as}} a {{sanatorium}} {{dealing with}} cases of diphtheria, scarlet fever and, in 1947, poliomyelitis. Two bombs fell close to the hospital during the Second World War. It became a general hospital in 1948 dealing with chronically ill and <b>geriatric</b> patients and closed in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Grass is the guinea pig's natural diet. Their molars are {{particularly}} suited for grinding plant matter, and grow continuously throughout the animal's life. Most grass-eating mammals are quite large {{and have a}} long digestive tract; while guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents, they must also supplement their diet by coprophagy, the eating of their own feces. However, they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately, but produce special soft pellets, called cecotropes, which recycle B vitamins, fiber, and bacteria required for proper digestion. The cecotropes (or caecal pellets) are eaten directly from the anus, unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese. They share this behaviour with rabbits. In <b>geriatric</b> boars or sows (the condition is rarer in young ones), the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus for consumption can become weak. This creates a condition known as anal impaction, which prevents the boar from redigesting cecotropes, though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass. The condition may be temporarily alleviated by carefully expelling the impacted feces.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with the}} parish of Olney, Buckinghamshire in 1714 several dozen {{small towns and}} {{individual}} parishes established their own institutions without any specific legal authorization. These were concentrated in the South Midlands and in the county of Essex. From the late 1710s the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge began to promote the idea of parochial workhouses. The Society published several pamphlets on the subject, and supported Sir Edward Knatchbull in his successful efforts to steer the Workhouse Test Act through parliament in 1723. The act gave legislative authority {{for the establishment of}} parochial workhouses, by both single parishes and as joint ventures between two or more parishes. More importantly, the Act helped to publicise the idea of establishing workhouses to a national audience. By 1776 some 1,912 parish and corporation workhouses had been established in England and Wales, housing almost 100,000 paupers. Perhaps one million people were receiving some kind of parish poor relief {{by the end of the}} century. Although many parishes and pamphlet writers expected to earn money from the labour of the poor in workhouses, the vast majority of people obliged to take up residence in workhouses were ill, elderly, or children whose labour proved largely unprofitable. The demands, needs and expectations of the poor also ensured that workhouses came to take on the character of general social policy institutions, combining the functions of creche, and night shelter, <b>geriatric</b> ward and orphanage. In 1782, Thomas Gilbert finally succeeded in passing an Act that established poor houses solely for the aged and infirm and introduced a system of outdoor relief for the able-bodied. This was the basis for the development of the Speenhamland system, which made financial provision for low-paid workers. Settlement Laws were altered by the Removal Act 1795 which prevented non-settled persons from being moved on unless they had applied for relief.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, specializations in {{pharmacy}} practice {{recognized by}} the Board of Pharmacy Specialties include: cardiovascular, infectious disease, oncology, pharmacotherapy, nuclear, nutrition, and psychiatry. The Commission for Certification in <b>Geriatric</b> Pharmacy certifies pharmacists in <b>geriatric</b> pharmacy practice. The American Board of Applied Toxicology certifies pharmacists and other medical professionals in applied toxicology.|$|E

25|$|Because {{trazodone}} has minimal anticholinergic activity, it {{was especially}} welcomed {{as a treatment for}} <b>geriatric</b> patients with depression when it first became available. Three double-blind studies reported trazodone has antidepressant efficacy similar to that of other antidepressants in <b>geriatric</b> patients. However, a side effect of trazodone, orthostatic hypotension, which may cause dizziness and increase the risk of falling, can have devastating consequences for elderly patients; thus, this side effect, along with sedation, often makes trazodone less acceptable for this population, compared with newer compounds that share its lack of anticholinergic activity but not the rest of its side-effect profile. Still, trazodone is often helpful for <b>geriatric</b> patients with depression who have severe agitation and insomnia.|$|E

25|$|According to the UC Davis Book of Dogs, small-breed dogs (such {{as small}} terriers) become <b>geriatric</b> at about 11 years; medium-breed dogs (such as larger spaniels) at 10 years; large-breed dogs (such as German Shepherd Dogs) at 8 years; and giant-breed dogs (such as Great Danes) at 7 years.|$|E
25|$|As with humans, {{advanced}} years often bring {{changes in}} a dog's ability to hear, see and move about easily. Skin condition, appetite and energy levels often degrade with <b>geriatric</b> age, and medical conditions such as cancer, renal failure, arthritis and joint conditions, and other signs of old age, may appear.|$|E
25|$|<b>Geriatric</b> {{patients}} (>65 years old) exhibit altered pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin {{compared to}} young adults, with mean AUC and Cmax {{values that are}} 40% and 30% higher, respectively. Additionally, healthy elderly patients show a greater pharmacodynamic response to atorvastatin at any dose; therefore, this population may have lower effective doses.|$|E
25|$|Getting On – Getting On is a satirical British sitcom {{based on}} a <b>geriatric</b> ward in an NHS hospital. It is written by its core cast, Jo Brand, Vicki Pepperdine, and Joanna Scanlan.

25|$|Cardinal van Roey, {{the head}} of the Catholic Church in Belgium intervened with the {{authorities}} to rescue Jews, and encouraged various institutions to aid Jewish children. One of his acts of rescue was to open a <b>geriatric</b> centre in which Jews were housed, at which kosher Jewish cooks would be required who could therefore be given special passes protecting them from deportation.|$|E
25|$|Yad Sarah's {{dental clinic}} {{is one of}} the few in the world specializing in <b>geriatric</b> dentistry. Volunteer dental surgeons, {{certified}} hygienists, and dental students provide treatment at the Jerusalem headquarters as well as in a mobile clinic that visits the elderly at home or in old age homes. On average, patients pay 70% of the cost price of dental treatment, and Yad Sarah subsidizes the remainder.|$|E
25|$|Guidelines {{regarding}} viral diagnoses {{and treatments}} change frequently and limit quality care. Even when physicians diagnose older patients with influenza, use of antiviral treatment can be low. Provider knowledge of antiviral therapies can improve patient care, especially in <b>geriatric</b> medicine. Furthermore, in {{local health departments}} (LHDs) with access to antivirals, guidelines may be unclear, causing delays in treatment. With time-sensitive therapies, delays could lead to lack of treatment.|$|E
25|$|Nurses after obtaining bachelor's {{degree and}} passing the {{entrance}} exam {{are eligible to}} continue their study in <b>geriatric</b> nursing, pediatric nursing, medical surgical nursing, community health nursing, psychiatric nursing and nursing education.

25|$|Whitehaven Castle {{was built}} in 1769, {{replacing}} an earlier building destroyed by fire. In 1924, the Earl of Lonsdale sold Whitehaven Castle to Mr H. Walker, who then donated the building {{to the people of}} Cumbria, along with monies to convert it into a hospital to replace the Victorian Whitehaven Hospital. With the opening of the new West Cumberland Hospital in 1964, the castle became a <b>geriatric</b> unit until forced to close in 1986, owing to fire regulations. It has now been converted to private housing.|$|E
25|$|In Dune, {{the desert}} of Arrakis {{is the only}} known source of the spice melange, the most {{essential}} and valuable commodity in the universe. Melange is a <b>geriatric</b> drug that gives the user a longer life span, greater vitality, and heightened awareness; it can also unlock prescience in some subjects, depending upon the dosage and the consumer's physiology. This prescience-enhancing property makes interstellar travel ("folding space") possible. Melange comes with a steep price however: it is highly addictive, and withdrawal is a fatal process.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study of}} 29 intact male dogs and 47 {{castrated}} males aged 11–14, the neutered males {{were significantly more likely}} to progress from one <b>geriatric</b> cognitive impairment condition (out of the four conditions – disorientation in the house or outdoors, changes in social interactions with human family members, loss of house training, and changes in the sleep-wake cycle) to two or more conditions. Testosterone in intact males is thought to slow the progression of cognitive impairment, at least in dogs that already have mild impairment.|$|E
