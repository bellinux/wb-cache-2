5|$|Overall, Europeans formed {{only about}} {{a tenth of the}} royalist armies in Spanish America, and only about half of the expeditionary units, once they were {{deployed}} in the Americas. Since each European soldier casualty was replaced by a Spanish American soldier, over time, there were more and more Spanish American soldiers in the expeditionary units. For example, Pablo Morillo, {{commander in chief of the}} expeditionary force sent to South America, reported that he had only 2,000 European soldiers under his command in 1820; in other words, only half the soldiers of his expeditionary force were European. It is estimated that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> of Maipú only a quarter of the royalist forces were European soldiers, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> of Carabobo about a fifth, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> of Ayacucho less than 1% was European.|$|E
