25|$|I {{had watched}} Ken Barrington – a great Test batsman – {{as a boy}} and when I broke into the England side in the late Seventies he became a father figure. In fact, he was a mentor {{to a lot of}} us then – myself, David Gower, Ian Botham, Mike Gatting. Ken was an England {{selector}} and assistant manager on the West Indies tour of 1981. There were no official coach in those days but it was to Ken that most of us turned. Unlike many retired pros, he never used the words, 'In my day...' On the first night of the Test, he suffered a heart attack in our hotel. I was woken the next morning at around 8am by tour manager Alan Smith and captain Ian Botham. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> wrong, because Both was never up before then. They told me the news. I had tears in my eyes when we went out on to the pitch for the minute's silence and again when I was batting in the second innings. We needed over 500 to win and it soon became apparent that we weren't going to get them. But I kept thinking of him and managed to make a hundred. Kenny was a counsellor, a friend and an inspiration.|$|E
500|$|Two songs, [...] "Low Down Freedom" [...] and [...] "Black Rose," [...] were {{produced}} by Ronny Light. [...] "We Had It All" [...] {{was produced by}} Jennings and Ken Mansfield. [...] Like the music within, the album cover was also {{at odds with the}} elaborate, often overwrought cover designs from Music Row, featuring an unpretentious shot of a smiling Jennings and his unkempt friends sat around a studio laughing and drinking. [...] In a 2008 interview with Dan MacIntosh, Shaver said of the LP, [...] "Oh, it was great, because the songs were bigger than me. And I couldn't possibly sing as good as Waylon. And at the time, Waylon was just great, so great, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> gonna happen good for him, and sure enough it helped me and it helped him, too, and that's a pretty good trade." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{the moment}} she said it <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> going to happen. You know that pre-what-d'you-call-it you get sometimes? Well, I got it then.|$|E
6000|$|... “But <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> {{worrying}} you,” {{insisted the}} shipowner’s son. “I’ve noticed it for several days, and Roger noticed it, too.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> wrong," [...] said Mrs. Parker. [...] "Where is the Captain? What {{made you}} laugh that way? Have the savages broken out?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you know, miss, hurry of {{any kind}} is bad for elderly gentlemen {{inclined}} to apoplexy. Sir John was in a worry all day, and not like himself. I wanted him to take his man, but he wouldn't; and drove off looking flushed and excited like. I'm anxious about him, for <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> amiss to hurry him off in this way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About the letter?" [...] said Molly. [...] "Yes, {{what was}} the trouble about the letter? <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> wrong {{directly}} I had said that I wrote it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My God! So it's Uncle Roger! <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> {{very wrong}} here--with him, with the place, the people. And right off I hated George Wright. Russ, does Diane know?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've got brother Jarge's girl to {{look after}} me now. She'll see I don't break barracks or do what I hadn't ought to. Why, darn my skin, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> amiss! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, {{there you}} <b>are!</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> {{tiresome}} <b>was</b> coming. What in the world--that's {{likely to turn}} up here--is worth an effort?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure," [...] was {{the ready}} answer. [...] "I wouldn't have butted in if <b>I</b> had <b>known</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> doing," [...] and Henry walked {{off toward the}} college buildings.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah {{too much}} has been imagined!" [...] she {{answered}} simply. [...] "It was only a word of warning. It was {{to tell you to}} go. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> painful <b>was</b> coming." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My God! So it's that? <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> {{terribly wrong}} here--with him--with the place--the people. And right off I hated Floyd Lawson. Oh, it'll kill me if--if--It's {{so much worse}} than I dreamed. What shall I do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Eilie {{was sitting}} there. If you don't know, sir, I can't {{tell you what}} it means to be near the woman one loves. She was leaning on the windowsill, staring down into the street. It was as though she might be looking out for some one. I stood, hardly breathing. She turned her head, and saw me. Her eyes were strange. They seemed to ask me a question. But I couldn't have spoken for the world. I can't tell you what I felt--I dared not speak, or think, or hope. I have been in {{nineteen}} battles--several times in positions of some danger, when the lifting of a finger perhaps meant death; but I have never felt what I was feeling at that moment. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> coming; and I was paralysed with terror lest it should not come!" [...] He drew a long breath.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, Ramsey--a {{precious}} seedy-looking customer. [...] "Well, sir," [...] says old Fogg, {{looking at}} him very fierce--you know his way--"well, Sir, have you come to settle?" [...] "Yes, I have, sir," [...] said Ramsey, putting his hand in his pocket, and bringing out the money, [...] "the debt's two pound ten, and the costs three pound five, and here it is, Sir;" [...] and he sighed like bricks, as he lugged out the money, done up {{in a bit of}} blotting-paper. Old Fogg looked first at the money, and then at him, and then he coughed in his rum way, so that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> coming. [...] "You don't know there's a declaration filed, which increases the costs materially, I suppose," [...] said Fogg. [...] "You don't say that, sir," [...] said Ramsey, starting back; [...] "the time was only out last night, Sir." [...] "I do say it, though," [...] said Fogg, [...] "my clerk's just gone to file it. Hasn't Mr. Jackson gone to file that declaration in Bullman and Ramsey, Mr. Wicks?" [...] Of course I said yes, and then Fogg coughed again, and looked at Ramsey. [...] "My God!" [...] said Ramsey; [...] "and here have I nearly driven myself mad, scraping this money together, and all to no purpose." [...] "None at all," [...] said Fogg coolly; [...] "so you had better go back and scrape some more together, and bring it here in time." [...] "I can't get it, by God!" [...] said Ramsey, striking the desk with his fist. [...] "Don't bully me, sir," [...] said Fogg, getting into a passion on purpose. [...] "I am not bullying you, sir," [...] said Ramsey. [...] "You are," [...] said Fogg; [...] "get out, sir; get out of this office, Sir, and come back, Sir, when you know how to behave yourself." [...] Well, Ramsey tried to speak, but Fogg wouldn't let him, so he put the money in his pocket, and sneaked out. The door was scarcely shut, when old Fogg turned round to me, with a sweet smile on his face, and drew the declaration out of his coat pocket. [...] "Here, Wicks," [...] says Fogg, [...] "take a cab, and go down to the Temple as quick as you can, and file that. The costs are quite safe, for he's a steady man with a large family, at a salary of five-and-twenty shillings a week, and if he gives us a warrant of attorney, as he must in the end, I know his employers will see it paid; so we may as well get all we can get out of him, Mr. Wicks; it's a Christian act to do it, Mr. Wicks, for with his large family and small income, he'll be all the better for a good lesson against getting into debt--won't he, Mr. Wicks, won't he?"--and he smiled so good-naturedly as he went away, that it was delightful to see him. He is a capital man of business,' said Wicks, in a tone of the deepest admiration, 'capital, isn't he?' ...|$|E
5000|$|Regarding happenings, Red Grooms has remarked, [...] "I had {{the sense}} that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> it <b>was</b> <b>something.</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> it <b>was</b> <b>something</b> because <b>I</b> didn't <b>know</b> what it was. I think that's when you're at your best point. When you're really doing something, you're doing it all out, but you don't know what it is." ...|$|R
6000|$|Rose {{leaned her}} flushed cheek {{on her hand}} and thought a minute, then looked up and {{answered}} honestly, [...] "Yes, I do, but can't explain it, except that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>something</b> must <b>be</b> wrong, because I blushed and started when you came in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No!" [...] replied Hymn-of-Praise solemnly, [...] "I have not. But I tell ye {{both that}} my hour hath come. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> {{happening}} in this house, and I climbed up that chimney {{in order to find}} out what it was." ...|$|R
5000|$|He said in 2014 that a {{substantial}} early influence on his music was The Beatles: [...] "The night The Beatles first played The Ed Sullivan Show, boy, that was something. Seeing them on TV was akin to a national holiday. Talk about an event. I never saw guys looking so cool. I had already heard some of their songs on the radio, but I wasn't prepared by how powerful and totally mesmerizing they were to watch. It changed me completely. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> different {{in the world that}} night." ...|$|E
5000|$|On October 24, Cabrera {{underwent}} {{surgery to remove}} a bone spur in his right ankle that had been bothering him for several months. He also had a procedure to repair a stress fracture in the navicular bone {{near the top of}} his right foot. Doctors knew about the bone spurs, but said the discovery of the broken bone was a surprise. Cabrera himself said he wasn't surprised, stating, [...] "I was feeling a lot of pain. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> wrong." [...] He said he had to alter his swing mechanics {{the last half of the}} 2014 season, being unable to put weight on his back foot without pain.|$|E
5000|$|Richards {{speaking}} on the history books he read in grade school: [...] "Usually the pictures told much more about American history than the text. I remembered seeing {{at a very early}} age a glowing photo of Custer and a few pages after (of) an elderly man, who looked like my own grandfather, lying dead in the snow. He was alone, and without care. I later found out his name was Miniconjou chief Spotted Elk (Bigfoot) and he was part of the massacre at Wounded Knee. That photo has always stuck with me. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> not right, and the text which was alongside it was not giving the full story." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> must <b>be</b> wrong--fearfully wrong--but <b>I</b> didn't <b>know</b> what. Even in my confusion, I {{found time}} {{to think that if}} that disagreeable-looking red-haired woman was Hannah Brewster, Kate must have had a queer taste in school friends. Then the man said, more gruffly than ever, [...] "Come now. Who are you and what {{business}} have you here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He may, because, after I {{discovered}} that the box was gone, I questioned him pretty closely as to {{who had been in}} the offices. <b>I</b> guess he <b>knows</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> wrong." ...|$|R
60|$|That's what you've been {{brooding}} {{over this}} last week, is it? Separation! <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> there <b>was</b> <b>something,</b> and <b>I</b> couldn't {{find out what}} it was.|$|R
5000|$|While Sham did not race {{again after}} the Belmont Stakes, he was not retired until July 1973 when he pulled up lame after a workout. The cause was a {{fractured}} right cannon bone, which was surgically repaired with three screws. [...] "Sham broke a cannonbone," [...] trainer Frank Martin said. [...] "I knew when he run so bad, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> wrong with him," [...] and with that his racing career officially ended. Sham was first sent to stud duty at Spendthrift Farm and later to Walmac International near Lexington, Kentucky. His progeny included stakes winners Arewehavingfunyet (f), Jaazeiro, and Safe Play, the dam of stakes winner Defensive Play.|$|E
5000|$|On April 4, 2005, SeaWorld Florida trainer Sam Davis was {{repeatedly}} [...] "bumped" [...] by Taku, an 11-year-old male orca. The show continued uninterrupted, but the trainer was later taken to Sand Lake Hospital for unspecified minor injuries and released the same day. According to an eyewitness, [...] "The trainer and Taku {{were about to}} slide on the slide {{out at the end}} of the show when Taku completely stopped and started bumping the trainer. The male trainer finally swam out of the tank. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> wrong because none of the whales except Kalina wanted to perform. Then they finally got Taku out to splash people at the end of the show, when this incident took place." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No; but I mean to see her. I couldn't {{make her}} first husband member, and {{therefore}} {{the man who is}} member is to be her second husband. But I'm almost sick of schemes. Oh, dear, <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> that <b>was</b> really pleasant to do.

5000|$|Gabrielle {{attempted}} suicide on December 12, 2012. Though Gladu {{was not yet}} out as trans, the suicide attempt was related to her gender identity and confusion surrounding her female identity that she had yet to explore. In regards to her suicide attempt, Gladu said, [...] "I was very, very confused. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> different about me. I was so afraid of what people would think of me.". Following her suicide attempt, Gabrielle began treatment at CHEO, and began intensive therapy by seeing social worker Richard Voss to help her develop coping mechanisms and address the issue. During the time she saw Voss, Gladu began to discover that her female identity was becoming stronger, and she started to research Transgender people and educate herself on Gender identity. Gabrielle has stated that she came out to herself on August 3, 2013, and had recorded a YouTube video coming out as Trans, but unfortunately never ended up posting it due to fear of rejection and hatred.|$|E

A compilation Greatest Hits, released by Porter's Wizard Records, peaked at number 2 in January 1982. In April 1981, Hines' brother Dwight committed suicide, and Hines later recalled being given the news by her mother. [...] "So she called, so <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> very, very, very wrong. So the first thing I said is, 'What's wrong with Deni?' And she said, 'Deni's fine. Your brother's dead.' My mother was to the point, you know, I said, 'What do you mean he's dead?' and I started boo-hooing, and she said, 'Shut up.' She said, 'Look, I took that child through measles, mumps and chicken pox. I gave birth to that child. That's my son, don't cry. Go home and bury him.' And I did just that."
