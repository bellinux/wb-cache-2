5|$|Alexander {{had planned}} to settle Greek colonists on Bahrain, and {{although}} {{it is not clear that}} this <b>happened</b> <b>on</b> the scale he envisaged, Bahrain became very much part of the Hellenised world: the language of the upper classes was Greek (although Aramaic was in everyday use), while Zeus was worshipped in the form of the Arabian sun-god Shams. Bahrain even became the site of Greek athletic contests.|$|E

With the death of Garfield, Chester A. Arthur stepped into the presidency.|$|E

5|$|A-10s {{returned}} to the Balkan region as part of Operation Allied Force in Kosovo beginning in March 1999. In March 1999, A-10s escorted and supported search and rescue helicopters in finding a downed F-117 pilot. The A-10s were deployed to support search and rescue missions, but over time the Warthogs began to receive more ground attack missions. The A-10's first successful attack in Operation Allied Force <b>happened</b> <b>on</b> 6 April 1999; A-10s remained in action until combat ended in late June 1999.|$|E
5|$|Although very {{conveniently}} sited for passengers, Ramsgate Harbour station presented severe operating difficulties. Its {{situation at}} the end of a steep gradient in the tunnel meant there was the constant risk that an out-of-control train would run through the station onto the beach, as <b>happened</b> <b>on</b> 3August 1891 and 24March 1915. Cramped conditions allowed no room for station growth or improvement, and the small turntable meant larger engines could not be used, so heavier trains needed two engines to haul them up the tunnel's gradient. Additionally, by the 1920s the population of Ramsgate had almost doubled since the station had opened, making the freight facilities inadequate, with no room for expansion.|$|E

5|$|Appointees to {{the offices}} of Steward of the Manor of Northstead and Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds are alternated so that two MPs can resign at once (as <b>happened</b> <b>on</b> 23 January 2017).

5|$|Coverage in Germany {{was more}} muted, with some {{newspapers}} strongly criticising {{those who had}} taken part, and no pictures published. In France, meanwhile, the greater level of press censorship ensured that the only word that spread of the truce came from soldiers at the front or first-hand accounts told by wounded men in hospitals. The press was eventually forced {{to respond to the}} growing rumours by reprinting a government notice that fraternising with the enemy constituted treason, and in early January an official statement on the truce was published, claiming it had <b>happened</b> <b>on</b> restricted sectors of the British front, and amounted to little more than an exchange of songs which quickly degenerated into shooting.|$|E
5|$|Full {{meetings}} of the Privy Council are held only when the reigning sovereign announces {{his or her own}} engagement (which last <b>happened</b> <b>on</b> 23 November 1839, in the reign of Queen Victoria); or when there is a demise of the Crown, either by the death or abdication of the monarch. A full meeting of the Privy Council was also held on 6 February 1811, when George, Prince of Wales was sworn in as Prince Regent by Act of Parliament. The current statutes regulating the establishment of a regency in the case of minority or incapacity of the sovereign also require any regents to swear their oaths before the Privy Council.|$|E

5|$|Librescu is {{most widely}} {{known for his}} actions during the Virginia Tech shooting, when he held the doors to his lecture hall closed, {{allowing}} {{all but one of}} his students enough time to escape through the windows. Shot and killed during the attack, Librescu was posthumously awarded the Order of the Star of Romania, the country's highest civilian honor. Coincidentally, Librescu's act of heroism <b>happened</b> <b>on</b> the 27th of Nisan on the Jewish lunar calendar. That date is Yom HaShoah which is Holocaust Remembrance Day in Israel.|$|E

Four men were arrested and charged with their murders. The deaths led to an angry reaction in England with Galatasaray fans being banned from attending the second leg in England.|$|E

5|$|The three Scottish soldiers' killings was an {{incident}} {{that took place in}} Northern Ireland during the Troubles. It <b>happened</b> <b>on</b> 10 March 1971, when the Provisional Irish Republican Army shot dead three unarmed British Army soldiers of the 1st Battalion, Royal Highland Fusiliers. Two of the three were teenage brothers; all three were from Scotland. They were killed off-duty and in civilian clothes, having been lured from a city-centre bar in Belfast, driven to a remote location and shot whilst relieving themselves by the roadside. Three British soldiers had been killed prior to this event; all had been on duty and killed during rioting.|$|E
5|$|The {{win over}} Virginia Tech gave the Eagles a 2–1 conference record, and they {{appeared}} to be destined for a bid to the ACC Championship Game.

Despite the losses, Boston College still had a chance to win the Atlantic Division—but only if other teams lost as well. This <b>happened</b> <b>on</b> November 6, when fellow Atlantic Division team Maryland lost to Virginia Tech, and the Eagles recovered from their losing streak with an out-of-conference win against Notre Dame.|$|E
