40|$|Much {{attention}} has been given, so far, in developing and implementing Safety Management Systems {{in order to reduce}} the probability of a major chemical accident. On the other hand, chemical emergency management has been given considerably less attention, although alot of related software packages are currently being used for this purpose. In this presentation, a new methodology is proposed, based on systems management and operational research, aiming at improving effective chemical emergency management. The methodology uses knowledge-based systems theory as a means to assist in taking rational decisions and the well established Project Evaluation and Review Technique to control the course of the chemical emergency management effort. The proposed scheme has been adopted in Greece during the development and implementation of an operational centre for chemical <b>emergencies</b> <b>coupled</b> with a detailed plan to be followed during such emergencies.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effects}} of pressure surge on pipe flow. The surge pressure investigated is that propagated by the <b>emergency</b> relief <b>coupling</b> valve (ERV) connected to a loading system carrying crude oil from four flow stations. The results of the analysis show remarkable changes in the fluid parameters arising from the shut down of the loading system by the ERV {{in the event of}} storm. For instance, in pipe 1 the pressure dropped from an initial value of 25 × 105 N/m 2 to 19 × 105 N/m 2, while the velocity of flow increased from 1. 76 m/s to 2. 97 m/s. The system showed high Reynolds number indicating turbulent flow and the Mach number in pipe IV as high as 3. 6 indicating supersonic flow. The consequence of the pressure drop is column separation or cavitations. If the bubbles collapse, re-surge pressures occur leading to possible leakages and rupture of the pipes. All these can be minimized by selecting appropriate surge suppression devices for the system...|$|R
5000|$|The Akron soon {{encountered}} severe weather, {{which did}} not improve when the airship passed over Barnegat Light, New Jersey at 10:00 pm as wind gusts of terrific force struck her massive airframe. The airship was being flown into an area of lower barometric pressure than at take-off, which caused the actual altitude flown to be lower than that indicated in the control gondola. Around 12:30 a.m. on 4 April, the Akron was caught by an updraft, followed almost immediately by a downdraft. Commander McCord, the captain, ordered full speed ahead, ballast dropped. The executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Herbert V. Wiley, handled the ballast and emptied the bow <b>emergency</b> ballast. <b>Coupled</b> with the elevator man holding the nose up, this caused the nose to rise and the tail to rotate down. The descent of the Akron was only temporarily halted, before downdrafts forced the airship down farther. Wiley activated the 18 [...] "howlers" [...] of the ship's telephone system, a signal to landing stations. At this point, the Akron was nose up, between 12 degrees and 25 degrees.|$|R

A commonly investigated problem is how complicated dynamics {{take place in}} dynamical systems consisting of (often simple) subsystems. It is shown though numerical experiments that emergent order such as periodic behavior can likely take place in coupled chaotic dynamical systems. This is demonstrated for the particular case of coupled chaotic continuous time Hopfield neural networks.

Furthermore, enhanced clarity on both sectoral and organizational (NGO, agencies) roles in supporting MHM as a priority, which can be facilitated through more consistent cross-sectoral dialog and the integration of MHM across internal planning, budgeting, and trainings at both the organizational and donor levels. However, such mainstreaming will only prove possible if MHM, across each organizational tier, is perceived as an essential component rather than supplementary response activity.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} experimental work and simulations of pressure surges resulting from fast closing valves and activation of an <b>emergency</b> release <b>coupling</b> (ERC) in ship-to-ship LNG transfer. The first part {{presents the results of}} an ambient water flow test with a fast closing 4 -inch full bore valve in combination with a 4 -inch flexible multi-composite hose. High amplitude pressure surges up to 4 times the working pressure occur upstream of the valve. Pressure surge amplitudes strongly depend on valve closing time and flow rate. The propagation speed in the upstream hose is lowered considerably due to the hose flexibility. Furthermore the temporarily deformation of the hose results in loss of energy and acoustic damping of the pressure surge amplitudes. The measurement results are compared to the results of modeling. Acoustic damping and propagation speed of sound show a non-linear behavior of the hose, due to a varying internal pressure, which is not captured in the present modeling techniques. The second part of the paper {{describes the}} results of a full scale flow test on an 8 -inch ERC (KLAW make) for LNG ship-to-ship transfer (Figure 1). The ERC in the test is located downstream of an 8 -inch 15 -meter long multi-composite flexible hose.

30|$|This study extends {{classical}} {{models of}} spreading epidemics {{to describe a}} coupling effect for government communication and rumor spreading after an emergency, which are both key information sources in <b>emergency</b> situations. A <b>coupled</b> system for government communication and rumor spreading was proposed.

Three different scenarios were identified according to the degree of government involvement to describe the evolution of population behavior under different information streams in an emergency. To conclude, our study may shed new light to comprehend information diffusion in emergencies and provide some hint on how to limit the spreading of rumor within populations when an emergency occurs. Nonetheless, {{it should be noted that}} we are dealing with models that are not the reality although to some extent they might help to grasp the reality.|$|R

RC) {{in combination with}} loading arms and multi-composite hoses are applied In view of a demand for increasing transfer flow rates in offshore LNG applications a 10 -inch ERC has been developed intended for LNG transfer flow rates up to 2250 m 3 lhr This paper describes the results of ambient water flow tests and release of the ERC in combination with a multi-composite hose If a standard instant closure ERC is activated it will stop any flow almost instantaneously due to fast closing of spring- operated butterfly valves, and will separate to disconnect the upstream and downstream transfer system. Due to fast closing of the ERC pressure surges will occur both in the upstream hose and downstream piping KLAW has developed a new model, whereby {{there is also a}} controlled closure valve (CCV) system incorporated in the <b>emergency</b> release <b>coupling</b> to reduce pressure surge amplitude by reducing the flow rate before Instantaneous' flip-flap valve closure. The test results show the impact of variation of flow rates and valve closure times on the amplitude of pressure surges, the spill rate and the mechanical integrity. The hose flexibility contributes to the damping of pressure surge amplitude, resulting shock load and high acceleration levels on the upstream piping The results of the test described contribute to the qualification of the ERC by Bureau Veritas and may contribute to further modelling and prediction of the impact of ERC release in actual applications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Parallel {{operation}} of power transformers {{is a common}} practice. Interest is placed on minimizing the reactive current circulation between transformers due to mismatching of electrical properties. Several control schemes have been applied {{over the years to}} ensure efficient {{operation of}} paralleled transformers with OLTC. These methods rely either on field measurements of circulating currents or on classic Master/Follower approach and usually assume that the paralleled transformers have matching impedances and OLTC positions. On the present work a generalized approach is implemented calculating the circulating current and minimizing losses directly at the System Operation Office and using the distribution system SCADA to control tap position of the paralleled transformers. This permits the determination of optimal tap matching between transformers and calculation of losses under <b>emergency</b> situations where <b>coupling</b> of transformers with slight impedance mismatch might be considered. In the proposed method a map of circulating current is calculated based on the transformer impedance, X/R ratio and OLTC positions, then the optimal tap positions (minimizing losses) under parallel operation are determined. ...|$|R

40|$|A novel co-simulation algorithm, {{referred}} to as the Interface-Jacobian-based Co-Simulation Algorithm (IJCSA), has been developed. The algorithm can solve co-simulation scenarios involving an arbitrary number of fields and signals. Due {{to the fact that the}} IJCSA is based on the residual form it handles algebraic loops in a natural manner. Furthermore, the individual simulators can run in parallel without flow dependency reducing the wall-clock time of the simulation, since the subsystems do not have to be executed using the classical Gauss-Seidel pattern. A thorough stability analysis of the IJCSA is presented. Furthermore, the practical applicability of the algorithm is demonstrated by solving a fully <b>coupled</b> <b>emergency</b> brake maneuver of a wind turbine.
