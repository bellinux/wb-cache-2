5|$|Another {{aggressive}} mimic of the cleaner wrasse, the bluestriped fangblenny, <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> an opioid-containing venom which dulls {{pain and}} lowers blood pressure, confusing the bitten host {{and giving the}} cheating mimic time to escape.|$|E
5|$|As a sensory adaptation, {{echolocation}} <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> {{separately in}} cetaceans (dolphins and whales) and bats, {{but from the}} same genetic mutations.|$|E
5|$|Biological {{structures}} or sequences {{in different}} taxa are homologous {{if they are}} derived from a common ancestor. Homology thus implies divergent evolution. For example, many insects (such as dragonflies) possess two pairs of flying wings. In beetles, the first pair of wings <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> {{into a pair of}} hard wing covers, while in Dipteran flies the second pair of wings <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> into small halteres used for balance.|$|E
50|$|The virus {{appears to}} <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> in North America. European strains appear to <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> {{from a single}} {{genotype}} (M) suggesting a single introductory event.|$|R
50|$|The current {{model of}} the {{evolution}} of the first living organisms is that these were some form of prokaryotes, which may <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> out of protocells. In general, the eukaryotes are thought to <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> later in the history of life.|$|R
50|$|Cretolamna is {{believed}} to <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> into the genus Otodus sometime in the Paleocene. Otodus {{is believed}} to <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> later into the Carcharocles genus. Others believe that Cretolamna evolved into the Paleocene shark Palaeocarcharodon, which some think evolved into Carcharodon carcharias.|$|R
5|$|Certain {{compound}} {{leaves of}} flowering plants are partially homologous both to leaves and shoots, because their development <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> from a genetic mosaic of leaf and shoot development.|$|E

5|$|Erythranthe parishii is also {{closely related}} to E. lewisii, but it <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> in a {{different}} direction as a self-pollinated species with small flowers.|$|E
50|$|The family Polydnaviridae may <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> {{from the}} Ascoviridae. Molecular {{evidence}} suggests that the Phycodnaviridae may <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> from the family Iridoviridae. These four families (Ascoviridae, Iridoviridae, Phycodnaviridae and Polydnaviridae) may form a clade but more work is needed to confirm this.|$|R

5|$|Although a honeyeater in origin, {{the striped}} honeyeater's food source is {{primarily}} insects, and its diet includes seeds and fruits {{as well as}} nectar. Its bill <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> to a short, straight, sharply pointed shape more suited to probing crevices for insects, than to probing flower tubes. It has the honeyeater’s brush tongue and takes nectar from shallow flowers such as eucalypt blossoms.|$|E
5|$|Batesian mimicry {{is a form}} of mimicry where a {{harmless}} species <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> to imitate the warning signals of a harmful species directed at a predator of them both. It is named after the English naturalist Henry Walter Bates, after his work on butterflies in the rainforests of Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Herrerasaurus had a {{flexible}} joint {{in the lower}} jaw that could slide {{back and forth to}} deliver a grasping bite. This cranial specialization is unusual among dinosaurs but <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> independently in some lizards. The rear of the lower jaw also had fenestrae. The jaws were equipped with large serrated teeth for biting and eating flesh, and the neck was slender and flexible.|$|E
500|$|Cellular origin theory : Some viruses may <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> from bits of DNA or RNA that [...] "escaped" [...] {{from the}} genes of a larger organism. The escaped DNA {{could have come from}} plasmids—pieces of DNA that can move between cells—while others may <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> from bacteria.|$|R
5000|$|Some plants <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> into annuals which die {{off at the}} end of {{each season}} and leave seeds for the next, whereas closely related plants in the same family <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> to live as perennials. This may be a {{programmed}} [...] "strategy" [...] for the plants.|$|R
50|$|The geminiviruses may <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> from phytoplasmal plasmids.|$|R
5|$|Hinduism is a {{combination}} of secular and sacred beliefs, rituals, daily practices and traditions that <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> over the course of over two thousand years and embodies complex symbolism combining the natural world with philosophy.|$|E
5|$|It was not, however, {{until the}} 1960s that Danish architects entered the world scene with their highly {{successful}} Functionalism. This, in turn, <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> into more recent world-class masterpieces {{such as the}} Sydney Opera House and the Great Belt Bridge {{paving the way for}} a number of Danish designers to be rewarded for excellence both at home and abroad.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{organized}} as the Continental Marines on November 10, 1775, as naval infantry, the Marine Corps <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> in its mission with changing military doctrine and American foreign policy.

5|$|The Ficus genus is {{composed}} of 800 species of vines, shrubs, and trees, including the cultivated fig, defined by their syconiums, the fruit-like vessels that either hold female flowers or pollen on the inside. Each fig species has its own fig wasp which (in most cases) pollinates the fig, so a tight mutual dependence <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> and persisted throughout the genus.|$|E
5|$|The Russian {{doctrine}} of military deception <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> with time, and it encompasses {{a number of}} meanings. The Russian term маскировка (maskirovka) literally means masking. An early military meaning was camouflage, soon extended to battlefield masking using smoke and other methods of screening. From there it came to have the broader meaning of military deception, widening to include denial and deception.|$|E
5|$|The {{aftercare}} {{process for}} body piercing <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> gradually through practice, and many myths and harmful recommendations persist. A reputable piercing studio should provide clients with written and verbal aftercare instructions, as {{is in some}} areas mandated by law.|$|E
50|$|Methods of shillelagh {{fighting}} <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> over {{a period}} of thousands of years, from the spear, staff, axe and sword fighting of the Irish. There is some evidence which suggests that the use of Irish stick weapons may <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> in a progression from a reliance on long spears and wattles, to shorter spears and wattles, to the shillelagh, alpeen, blackthorn (walking-stick) and short cudgel. By the 19th century Irish shillelagh-fighting <b>had</b> <b>evolved</b> into a practice which involved the use of three basic types of weapons, sticks which were long, medium or short in length.|$|R

5|$|The {{architecture}} of Norway <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> {{in response to}} changing economic conditions, technological advances, demographic fluctuations and cultural shifts. While outside architectural influences are apparent in much of Norwegian architecture, they have often been adapted to meet Norwegian climatic conditions, including: harsh winters, high winds and, in coastal areas, salt spray.|$|E

The concept has expanded to include worlds {{not only in the}} Solar System, but in hundreds of other extrasolar systems. The ambiguities inherent in defining planets have led to much scientific controversy.|$|E
