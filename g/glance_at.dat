5|$|It is {{also said}} that on the {{southern}} side of the track stood cliffs that overlooked the pass. However, a <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> any photograph of the pass shows there are no cliffs, only steep slopes covered in thorny bushes and trees. Although no obstacle to individuals, such terrain would not be passable by an army and its baggage train.|$|E
5|$|This {{landscape}} {{gave him}} assurance. A fair field holding life. It was {{the religion of}} peace. It would die if its timid eyes were compelled to see blood.... He threw a pine cone at a jovial squirrel, and he ran with chattering fear. High in a treetop he stopped, and, poking his head cautiously from behind a branch, looked down {{with an air of}} trepidation. The youth felt triumphant at this exhibition. There was the law, he said. Nature had given him a sign. The squirrel, immediately upon recognizing danger, had taken to his legs without ado. He did not stand stolidly baring his furry belly to the missile, and die with an upward <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> the sympathetic heavens. On the contrary, he had fled as fast as his legs could carry him.|$|E

He and Venus were necessarily seated close together, as each held {{a corner of the}} document, which was but a common sheet of paper.|$|R

5|$|From {{the work}} of Heaviside (1887) it had become clear that the {{performance}} of telegraph lines, and most especially telephone lines, could be improved {{by the addition of}} inductance to the line. George Campbell at AT implemented this idea (1899) by inserting loading coils at intervals along the line. Campbell found that as well as the desired improvements to the line's characteristics in the passband there was also a definite frequency beyond which signals could not be passed without great attenuation. This was a result of the loading coils and the line capacitance forming a low-pass filter, an effect that is only apparent on lines incorporating lumped components such as the loading coils. This naturally led Campbell (1910) to produce a filter with ladder topology, a <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> the circuit diagram of this filter is enough to see its relationship to a loaded transmission line. The cut-off phenomenon is an undesirable side-effect as far as loaded lines are concerned but for telephone FDM filters it is precisely what is required. For this application, Campbell produced band-pass filters to the same ladder topology by replacing the inductors and capacitors with resonators and anti-resonators respectively. Both the loaded line and FDM were of great benefit economically to AT and this led to fast development of filtering from this point onwards.|$|E

25|$|Ursa Minor is not {{the only}} {{constellation}} that does not look very much like what it represents; very few do. This has led to nicknames for some of the constellations. These nicknames are another variety of asterism. A <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> the stick-figures shown in the charts under the constellation names will easily explain the origin of these asterisms.|$|E
25|$|Bowling alleys built {{during this}} period often {{featured}} restaurants or nightclubs where locally or even nationally prominent entertainers would perform. In the 1948 movie Road House, the title refers to a large bowling alley with a nightclub attached, {{where much of the}} action takes place. The film provides a good historical <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> bowling alleys of the era.|$|E

25|$|It {{seems that}} overall sales volumes {{were from the}} start lower than Panhard had {{anticipated}} for the car, which {{may have contributed to}} arguments against progressing development of the four-door version that had been envisaged. Although mid-size two-door saloons sold in reasonable numbers in Germany and the Alpine countries, a <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> the sales data suggests that in the French market four doors were a precondition for healthy sales volumes.|$|E
25|$|It was so {{constructed}} as to receive animals; guns, pistols, and cutlasses {{hung on the}} walls; and these, with curious saddles and primitive riding gear, might lead a visitor to imagine he had entered a pioneer's cabin or border chieftain's hut; such an idea would, however, have been once dispelled by <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> the many sketches and studies which proclaimed that an artist, and not a bushranger, had here found a home.|$|E
25|$|In the {{examples}} {{seen so far}} the same metre is used for several lines at a time; but a <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> Moore’s database shows that iambic and trochaic lines are often mixed together, as in the passage below from Terence’s Phormio (485-492), which Moore discusses in an article. In these lines the young man Phaedria pleads with the slave-owner Dorio for more time {{to raise the money}} to buy his girlfriend; Phaedria’s cousin Antipho and the slave Geta secretly listen in on the conversation.|$|E

25|$|The film's villain, Freddy Krueger, draws {{heavily from}} Craven's early life. One night, a young Craven saw {{an elderly man}} walking on the sidepath outside {{the window of his}} home. The man stopped to <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> a startled Craven and walked off. This served as the {{inspiration}} for Krueger. Initially, Fred Krueger was intended to be a child molester, but Craven eventually characterized him as a child murderer to avoid being accused of exploiting a spate of highly publicized child molestation cases that occurred in California around the time of production of the film.|$|E
25|$|Loweswater {{is unique}} amongst the major lakes of the District in {{emptying}} toward {{the centre of}} the National Park. Its waters flow out eastwards into Crummock Water before beginning their northward journey as the Cocker. Loweswater does not therefore represent any watershed between the fells on either side of its valley, as might be supposed from a quick <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> the map. A low ridge circuiting the western end of the lake joins Burnbank Fell to Low Fell and Fellbarrow, confirming them as the last outpost of the Western Fells.|$|E
25|$|When one is {{learning}} another language, vocabulary presents difficulties. One must continuously search for unknown words, and consequently interest is lost. In the elementary part, however, this {{problem has been}} overcome, because the relevant translation of each word appears below the Volapük words. A selection of readings follows, and {{it is suggested that}} the Volapük words be read out loud. The grammar and a basic vocabulary have already been done in the introduction; nevertheless, a quick <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> the translation is recommended to ensure that the overall meaning has been acquired. There is a maxim which states that a little study a day is better than a lot of study all at once.|$|E

He may however have been misled by the massing of the Prussian troops between the salient point of the position, Saint-Amand, and the road in question, {{as well as by the}} direction of the line of the occupied villages of Saint-Amand, Ligny, and Sombreffe. It must also be acknowledged that although the inference was incorrectly drawn, it accorded in substance with the real fact, that Blücher did rely upon the arrival of a portion of Wellington's forces by the Namur road from Quatre Bras.|$|E
