5|$|The Isobarik is {{so named}} as it employs the <b>isobaric</b> loading {{principle}} invented by Harry Olson in the 1950s: two bass units are mounted {{in a sealed}} container and driven in parallel so as to effectively double the speaker enclosure volume and extend its bass frequency response beyond what would be possible for otherwise identical speakers. Linn used {{a variant of the}} <b>isobaric</b> principle and patented the use of two bass drive units ("woofers") facing forward in an <b>isobaric</b> arrangement in early 1974.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy Physiological Laboratory {{published}} tables {{based on}} Hempleman's tissue slab diffusion model in 1972, <b>isobaric</b> counterdiffusion in subjects who breathed one inert gas mixture while {{being surrounded by}} another was first described by Graves, Idicula, Lambertsen, and Quinn in 1973, and the French government published the MT74 Tables du Ministère du Travail in 1974.|$|E
5|$|As a {{three-way}} loudspeaker system employing six individual drive units, each Isobarik kabinet has two tweeters, two midrange drivers and two woofers. One driver of each frequency range faces forward; a second tweeter and midrange are {{mounted on the}} top surface of the enclosure, and one bass unit is hidden from view. While the bass units are <b>isobaric</b> loaded, the midrange is mounted in a terminated transmission line. Crossover points are set at 375Hz between the woofer and midrange, and 3kHz between the tweeter and midrange. The upward-firing drivers were designed to aid dispersion and improve the off-axis listening experience.|$|E
5|$|As part {{of their}} {{corporate}} philosophy, Linn intended significant dealer involvement in customer education and decision-making, and included teaching customers how to listen correctly for musical attributes. The trial and evaluation of the product prior to purchase and dealer's expert installation are considered by Linn to be important parts of the value added of their top-end products. As such, no instructions were supplied with the product. The <b>Isobaric</b> PMS retailed at £2,400 including stands in May 1991, and the 4-ohm crossover was priced at just under £500.|$|E
5|$|<b>Isobaric</b> {{analysis}} is performed on these maps, which involves {{the construction of}} lines of equal mean sea level pressure. The innermost closed lines indicate the positions of relative maxima and minima in the pressure field. The minima are called low-pressure areas while the maxima are called high-pressure areas. Highs are often shown as H's whereas lows are shown as L's. Elongated areas of low pressure, or troughs, are sometimes plotted as thick, brown dashed lines down the trough axis. Isobars are commonly used to place surface boundaries from the horse latitudes poleward, while streamline analyses {{are used in the}} tropics. A streamline {{analysis is}} a series of arrows oriented parallel to wind, showing wind motion within a certain geographic area. C's depict cyclonic flow or likely areas of low pressure, while A's depict anticyclonic flow or likely positions of high-pressure areas. An area of confluent streamlines shows the location of shearlines within the tropics and subtropics.|$|E
25|$|Similar inequalities {{are valid}} for other {{classical}} {{conditions for the}} closed systems and the corresponding characteristic functions: for isothermal <b>isobaric</b> conditions the Gibbs free energy decreases, for the isochoric systems with the constant internal energy (isolated systems) the entropy increases {{as well as for}} <b>isobaric</b> systems with the constant enthalpy.|$|E
25|$|Superficial ICD (also {{known as}} Steady State <b>Isobaric</b> Counterdiffusion) {{occurs when the}} inert gas breathed by the diver diffuses more slowly into the body than the inert gas {{surrounding}} the body.|$|E
25|$|Deep Tissue ICD (also {{known as}} Transient <b>Isobaric</b> Counterdiffusion) occurs when {{different}} inert gases are breathed by the diver in sequence. The rapidly diffusing gas is transported into the tissue {{faster than the}} slower diffusing gas is transported out of the tissue.|$|E
25|$|An {{effective}} {{sample preparation}} protocol, usually involving either liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) or solid phase extraction (SPE) and frequently derivatisation can remove ion suppressing species {{from the sample}} matrix prior to analysis. These common approaches may also remove other interferences, such as <b>isobaric</b> species.|$|E
25|$|If the {{pressure}} in a system remains constant (<b>isobaric),</b> a vapor at saturation temperature will begin to condense into its liquid phase as thermal energy (heat) is removed. Similarly, a liquid at saturation temperature and pressure will boil into its vapor phase as additional thermal energy is applied.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{hypothesis}} {{to explain}} the incidence of IEDCS when switching from trimix to nitrox was proposed by Steve Burton, who considered {{the effect of the}} much greater solubility of nitrogen than helium in producing transient increases in total inert gas pressure, which could lead to DCS under <b>isobaric</b> conditions.|$|E
25|$|In {{nuclear physics}} and {{particle}} physics, isospin (isotopic spin, <b>isobaric</b> spin) is a quantum number {{related to the}} strong interaction. Particles that are affected equally by the strong force but have different charges (e.g. protons and neutrons) can be treated as being different states of the same particle with isospin values related {{to the number of}} charge states.|$|E
25|$|A nearly <b>isobaric</b> {{solution}} is possible if the compressed gas {{is used to}} drive a hydroelectric system. However, this solution requires large pressure tanks located on land (as well as the underwater air bags). Also, hydrogen gas is the preferred fluid, since other gases suffer from substantial hydrostatic pressures at even relatively modest depths (such as 500 meters).|$|E
25|$|TAILS, or “N-Terminomics,” was {{designed}} and developed by the Overall Lab to overcome the functional limitations of conventional proteomics by enriching both mature N-terminal peptides and newly generated N-terminal peptides of proteins produced by protease activity. Formaldehyde or <b>isobaric</b> tags including Isotope-coded Affinity Tags (ICAT), 4 to 8 plex <b>Isobaric</b> tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ), or 10plex Tandem mass tags (TMT) block primary amines prior to trypsin digestion of proteome samples. The main step of the process is the negative selection of newly generated trypsin peptides using a specialized polymer. The polymer ignores the unreactive primary amines blocked by their tags, allowing them {{to be separated from}} trypsin generated peptides by ultrafiltration for Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. These mature and neo-N-termini will differ in ratios between the protease treated versus untreated samples and make up the proteolytic fingerprint of a protease. TAILS is also compatible with Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC).|$|E
25|$|Deep Tissue ICD (also {{known as}} Transient <b>Isobaric</b> Counterdiffusion) occurs when {{different}} inert gases are breathed by the diver in sequence. The rapidly diffusing gas is transported into the tissue {{faster than the}} slower diffusing gas is transported out of the tissue. This can occur as divers switch from a nitrogen mixture to a helium mixture or when saturation divers breathing hydreliox switch to a heliox mixture.|$|E
25|$|<b>Isobaric</b> counter{{diffusion}} is {{the diffusion}} of gases in opposite directions caused by {{a change in the}} composition of the external ambient gas or breathing gas without change in the ambient pressure. During decompression after a dive this can occur when a change is made to the breathing gas, or when the diver moves into a gas filled environment which differs from the breathing gas.|$|E
25|$|This {{term was}} derived from isotopic spin, a {{confusing}} term to which nuclear physicists prefer <b>isobaric</b> spin, which is more precise in meaning. Isospin symmetry is {{a subset of the}} flavour symmetry seen more broadly in the interactions of baryons and mesons. Isospin symmetry remains an important concept in particle physics. A close examination of this symmetry, historically, led directly to the discovery and understanding of quarks and of the development of Yang–Mills theory.|$|E
25|$|Superficial ICD (also {{known as}} Steady State <b>Isobaric</b> Counterdiffusion) {{occurs when the}} inert gas breathed by the diver diffuses more slowly into the body than the inert gas {{surrounding}} the body. An example {{of this would be}} breathing air in an heliox environment. The helium in the heliox diffuses into the skin quickly, while the nitrogen diffuses more slowly from the capillaries to the skin and out of the body. The resulting effect generates supersaturation in certain sites of the superficial tissues and the formation of inert gas bubbles.|$|E
25|$|Put simply, ion {{suppression}} {{describes the}} {{adverse effect on}} detector response due to reduced ionisation efficiency for analyte(s) of interest, resulting from the presence of species in the sample matrix which compete for ionisation, or inhibit efficient ionisation in other ways. Use of MS/MS {{as a means of}} detection may give the impression that there are no interfering species present, since no chromatographic impurities are detected. However, species which are not <b>isobaric</b> may still have an adverse effect on the sensitivity, accuracy and precision of the assay owing to suppression of the ionisation of the analyte of interest.|$|E
25|$|The {{scope of}} diving {{medicine}} must necessarily include {{conditions that are}} specifically connected with the activity of diving, and not found in other contexts, but this categorization excludes almost everything, leaving only deep water blackout, <b>isobaric</b> counterdiffusion and high pressure nervous syndrome. A more useful grouping is conditions {{that are associated with}} exposure to variations of ambient pressure. These conditions are largely shared by aviation and space medicine. Further conditions associated with diving and other aquatic and outdoor activities are commonly included in books which are aimed at the diver, rather than the specialist medical practitioner, as they are useful background to diver first aid training.|$|E
25|$|Radioactive {{beams of}} {{specific}} isotopes {{are widely used}} {{in the fields of}} experimental physics, biology and materials science. The production and formation of these radioactive atoms into an ionic beam for study is an entire field of research carried out at many laboratories throughout the world. The first isotope separator was developed at the Copenhagen Cyclotron by Bohr and coworkers using the principle of electromagnetic separation. Today, there are many laboratories around the world that supply beams of radioactive ions for use. Arguably the principal Isotope Separator On Line (ISOL) is ISOLDE at CERN, which is a joint European facility spread across the Franco-Swiss border near the city of Geneva. This laboratory uses mainly proton spallation of uranium carbide targets to produce a wide range of radioactive fission fragments that are not found naturally on earth. During spallation (bombardment with high energy protons), a uranium carbide target is heated to several thousand degrees so that radioactive atoms produced in the nuclear reaction are released. Once out of the target, the vapour of radioactive atoms travels to an ionizer cavity. This ionizer cavity is a thin tube made of a refractory metal with a high work function allowing for collisions with the walls to liberate a single electron from a free atom (surface ionization effect). Once ionized, the radioactive species are accelerated by an electrostatic field and injected into an electromagnetic separator. As ions entering the separator are of approximately equal energy, those ions with a smaller mass will be deflected by the magnetic field by a greater amount than those with a heavier mass. This differing radius of curvature allows for <b>isobaric</b> purification to take place. Once purified isobarically, the ion beam is then sent to the individual experiments. In order to increase the purity of the <b>isobaric</b> beam, laser ionization can take place inside the ionizer cavity to selectively ionize a single element chain of interest. At CERN, this device is called the Resonance Ionization Laser Ion Source (RILIS). Currently over 60% of all experiments opt to use the RILIS to increase the purity of radioactive beams.|$|E
500|$|... 1973 – <b>Isobaric</b> counterdiffusion {{was first}} {{described}} by D.J. Graves, J. Idicula, Christian Lambertson, and J.A. Quinn in subjects who breathed one inert gas mixture while {{being surrounded by}} another.|$|E
500|$|Launched in 1973, the Isobarik DMS, Linn's maiden and {{flagship}} loudspeaker {{was based}} on and named for the <b>isobaric</b> loading principle invented in the 1950s. The speaker exists also as the Isobarik PMS [...] destined for the professional market. Although discontinued in 1992, it remains popular among audiophiles.|$|E
500|$|DCS {{can also}} be caused at a {{constant}} ambient pressure when switching between gas mixtures containing different proportions of inert gas. This is known as <b>isobaric</b> counterdiffusion, and presents a problem for very deep dives. For example, after using a very helium-rich trimix at the deepest part of the dive, a diver will switch to mixtures containing progressively less helium and more oxygen and nitrogen during the ascent. Nitrogen diffuses into tissues 2.65 times slower than helium, but is about 4.5 times more soluble. Switching between gas mixtures that have very different fractions of nitrogen and helium can result in [...] "fast" [...] tissues (those tissues that have a good blood supply) actually increasing their total inert gas loading. This is often found to provoke inner ear decompression sickness, as the ear seems particularly sensitive to this effect.|$|E

500|$|Linn {{brochures}} dwell {{little on}} performance specifications, mentioning somewhat vaguely that the frequency response [...] "varies {{by only a}} few db from 20Hz to 20KHz with the <b>isobaric</b> loading extending usable bass response to below 10Hz". Linn also claimed [...] "very low distortion" [...] and [...] "high sound pressure levels", without quantification. Recommended amplifier power rating is {{in the range of}} 50500watts. Hi-Fi for Pleasure noted that the speakers' impedance, although quoted at 3 ohms nominal, dipped considerably at some parts of the audio spectrum. This made the DMS Isobarik very hard for amplifiers to drive, potentially causing many amplifiers' output protection to trip. Equally, the two heavy woofers in each Isobarik made them twice as power-hungry. Such demands happened to make Naim amplification the perfect match because of its high current delivery capabilities and its toleration of near short circuits. The Isobarik was famously used as the acid test for the budget-priced NAD 3020 amplifier at its UK launch. In the 1970s, the DMS Isobarik, available in a number of veneers, sold for £1,000.|$|E
500|$|Decompression can be {{accelerated}} {{by the use of}} breathing gases during ascent with lowered inert gas fractions (as a result of increased oxygen fraction). This will result in a greater diffusion gradient for a given ambient pressure, and consequently accelerated decompression for a relatively low risk of bubble formation. Nitrox mixtures and oxygen are the most commonly used gases for this purpose, but oxygen rich trimix blends can also be used after a trimix dive, and oxygen rich heliox blends after a heliox dive, and these may reduce risk of <b>isobaric</b> counterdiffusion complications. Doolette and Mitchell showed that when a switch is made to a gas with a different proportion of inert gas components, it is possible for an inert component previously absent, or present as a lower fraction, to in-gas faster than the other inert components are eliminated (inert gas counterdiffusion), sometimes resulting in raising the total tissue tension of inert gases in a tissue to exceed the ambient pressure sufficiently to cause bubble formation, even if the ambient pressure has not been reduced {{at the time of the}} gas switch. They conclude that [...] "breathing-gas switches should be scheduled deep or shallow to avoid the period of maximum supersaturation resulting from decompression".|$|E
2500|$|Vertigo is {{recorded}} as {{a symptom of}} decompression sickness in 5.3% of cases by the US Navy as reported by Powell, 2008 [...] It including <b>isobaric</b> decompression sickness.|$|E
2500|$|There {{is another}} effect which can {{manifest}} {{as a result}} of the disparity in solubility between inert breathing gas diluents, which occurs in <b>isobaric</b> gas switches near the decompression ceiling between a low solubility gas (typically helium, and a higher solubility gas, typically nitrogen) ...|$|E
2500|$|Redox {{reactions}} are chemical [...] reactions in which electrons are transferred from a donor molecule to an acceptor molecule. The underlying force driving these reactions is the Gibbs free {{energy of the}} reactants and products. [...] The Gibbs free energy is the energy available (“free”) to do work. [...] Any reaction that decreases the overall Gibbs free energy of a system will proceed spontaneously (given {{that the system is}} <b>isobaric</b> and also adiabatic), although the reaction may proceed slowly if it is kinetically inhibited.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Isobaric</b> counter{{diffusion}} is {{the diffusion}} of gases in opposite directions caused by {{a change in the}} composition of the external ambient gas or breathing gas without change in the ambient pressure. During decompression after a dive this can occur when a change is made to the breathing gas, or when the diver moves into a gas filled environment which differs from the breathing gas. While not strictly speaking a phenomenon of decompression, it is a complication that can occur during decompression, and that can result in the formation or growth of bubbles without changes in the environmental pressure. Two forms of this phenomenon have been described by Lambertsen: ...|$|E
2500|$|Each {{quantity}} in {{the equations}} above {{can be divided}} {{by the amount of}} substance, measured in moles, to form molar Gibbs free energy. The Gibbs free energy {{is one of the most}} important thermodynamic functions for the characterization of a system. It is a factor in determining outcomes such as the voltage of an electrochemical cell, and the equilibrium constant for a reversible reaction. In isothermal, <b>isobaric</b> systems, Gibbs free energy can be thought of as a [...] "dynamic" [...] quantity, in that it is a representative measure of the competing effects of the enthalpic and entropic driving forces involved in a thermodynamic process.|$|E
2500|$|Bernoulli's {{equation}} is sometimes valid for {{the flow of}} gases: provided {{that there is no}} transfer of kinetic or potential energy from the gas flow to the compression or expansion of the gas. [...] If both the gas pressure and volume change simultaneously, then work will be done on or by the gas. [...] In this case, Bernoulli's equation – in its incompressible flow form – cannot be assumed to be valid. [...] However, if the gas process is entirely <b>isobaric,</b> or isochoric, then no work is done on or by the gas, (so the simple energy balance is not upset). [...] According to the gas law, an <b>isobaric</b> or isochoric process is ordinarily the only way to ensure constant density in a gas. [...] Also the gas density will be proportional to the ratio of pressure and absolute temperature, however this ratio will vary upon compression or expansion, no matter what non-zero quantity of heat is added or removed. [...] The only exception is if the net heat transfer is zero, as in a complete thermodynamic cycle, or in an individual isentropic (frictionless adiabatic) process, and even then this reversible process must be reversed, to restore the gas to the original pressure and specific volume, and thus density. [...] Only then is the original, unmodified Bernoulli equation applicable. [...] In this case the equation can be used if the flow speed of the gas is sufficiently below the speed of sound, such that the variation in density of the gas (due to this effect) along each streamline can be ignored. [...] Adiabatic flow at less than Mach 0.3 is generally considered to be slow enough.|$|E
2500|$|In thermodynamics, the Gibbs {{free energy}} (IUPAC {{recommended}} name: Gibbs energy or Gibbs function; {{also known as}} free enthalpy to distinguish it from Helmholtz free energy) is a thermodynamic potential {{that can be used}} to calculate the maximum of reversible work that may be performed by a thermodynamic system at a constant temperature and pressure (isothermal, <b>isobaric).</b> [...] The Gibbs free energy (J in SI units) is the maximum amount of non-expansion work that can be extracted from a thermodynamically closed system (one that can exchange heat and work with its surroundings, but not matter); this maximum can be attained only in a completely reversible process. When a system transforms reversibly from an initial state to a final state, the decrease in Gibbs free energy equals the work done by the system to its surroundings, minus the work of the pressure forces.|$|E
2500|$|Decompression {{sickness}} {{can also}} be caused at a constant ambient pressure when switching between gas mixtures containing different proportions of inert gas.

2500|$|Some {{scuba diving}} {{curricula}} may apply the terms shallow-water blackout and deep-water blackout differently; deep-water blackout being {{applied to the}} final stage of nitrogen narcosis while shallow water blackout may be applied to a blackout from a deep free dive. [...] Nitrogen narcosis does not normally apply to freediving as free-divers start and finish the dive with only a single lungful of air and it has long been assumed that free divers are not exposed to the necessary pressure for long enough to absorb sufficient nitrogen. [...] Where these terms are used in this manner there is usually little or no discussion of the phenomenon of blackouts not involving depressurisation and the cause may be variously attributed to either depressurisation or hypocapnia or both. This problem may stem from the origin of the term latent hypoxia {{in the context of a}} string of fatal, shallow water accidents with early military, closed-circuit rebreather apparatus prior to the development of effective oxygen partial pressure measurement. In the very different context of dynamic apnea sports careful consideration of terms is needed to avoid potentially dangerous confusion between two phenomena that actually have different characteristics, mechanisms and prevention measures. The application of the term shallow water blackout to deep dives and its subsequent association with extreme sports has tended to mislead many practitioners of static apnea and dynamic apnea distance diving into thinking that it does not apply to them even though <b>isobaric</b> shallow water blackout kills swimmers every year, often in shallow swimming pools.|$|E
