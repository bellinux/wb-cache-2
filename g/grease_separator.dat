The pretreatment of sewages with high lipid loads is absolutely important {{in order to}} prevent damages. Bioaugmentation technology, i. e. the use of microorganisms, {{turned out to be a}} means to increase the performance of conventional grease traps. Various microorganisms were evaluated regarding their ability to degrade fat oil and grease within a grease trap. Subsequently the biological degradation of waste fats was studied in different experimental scales. Lab scale experiments in batch culture showed that a mixture of different microorganisms (Yarrowia spp., Candida sp., Rhodococcus spp. and Pseudomonas sp.) eliminated 70 % of applied waste fat within 24 h and 90 % in 14 d, respectively. Thus, the mixed culture eliminated 7. 2 g FOG/l* 5 d- 1 at a volumetric loading of 8 g FOG * l- 1. In comparison, autochthone microorganisms eliminated 57. 4 % (129. 5 mg) of the applied FOG within 14 d. In contrast to the work of (Brooksbank et al. 2007), the abiotic controls showed only a minor decrease of extractable FOG over the experimental time, i. e. 7. 5 % (15 mg FOG) of the applied waste fat within 14 d. In summary, the lab-scale experiments demonstrated that pure cultures are less suited for the degradation of fat than complex mixed cultures. In a fat separator model (scale 1 : 10) developed for this purpose a number of improvements were tested in order to modify a conventional <b>grease</b> <b>separator</b> in order to provide a system suitable for successful bioaugmentation. The tests showed that Rhodococcus erythropolis and Candida cylindracea were able to establish themselves inside the simulator. The FOG loads were almost completely eliminated over the test period of 147 d. Although the COD increased in effluent samples over the time, the content of FOG decreased (600 mg FOG/L at the beginning of the test period, 280 mg FOG/L after 90 days). Bioaugmentation studies were carried out in pilot scale using a modified <b>grease</b> <b>separator,</b> type „TOPO SF/E 2 / 200 “ downstream of a restaurant kitchen facility. The pilot plant worked without technical disturbances over the whole test period of six months. Unfortunately, the first two bioaugmentation campaigns were not successful. Contrary to the results obtained in lab scale experiments, the microorganisms were not able to establish themselves in the system due to drastic changes of pH (3 - 12) in all compartments of the <b>grease</b> <b>separator.</b> These extreme pH levels were not expectable, because they are illegal and prohibited by constitutions and prescriptive limits of the municipal administration. The pilot scale studies displayed that the prescriptive limits were neither attained with nor without the bioaugmentation system. As of now, the technical practice prevents the successful operation of implemented bioaugmentation. The use of neutral detergents and a separated disposal of disinfectants should allow for the future use of bioaugmentation processes to eliminate grease loads within a <b>grease</b> <b>separator...</b>|$|E

40|$|Commercial kitchens {{are subject}} to high heat loads, vapour, fumes, odours and various aerosols, which are {{generated}} during cooking processes. Studies have shown, that long term exposure to cooking emissions creates adverse health effects for kitchen workers. To {{be able to control}} kitchen environment, improve thermal conditions and remove harmful cooking emissions, exhaust hoods are utilised. Inside an exhaust hood, separation of grease and condensate takes place in order to reduce ventilation maintenance costs and ensure that fire safety and hygienic requirements are met. A number of grease filtering techniques exist, however, the majority of hoods utilise single stage filtering using <b>grease</b> <b>separators.</b> The goal {{of this study is to}} determine pressure drop and grease extraction efficiency characteristics of exhaust hoods produced by a Lithuanian manufacturer. In this study, pressure drop characteristics of exhaust hoods with condensing plates and two different types of <b>grease</b> <b>separators</b> are determined. Pressure drop characteristics are essential for selection process of an exhaust fan. What is more, these characteristics are also used for determining exhaust hood air flow rate, so that ventilation engineers are able to adjust it to a required air flow rate. A comparative study of 3 different types of <b>grease</b> <b>separators</b> are carried out in order to identify the most efficient type of separators by determining and comparing their fractional separation efficiencies. For this analysis, a special experimental stand is designed and utilized for testing. This study will allow to determine the most efficient type of grease extractors...|$|R
30|$|Primary and {{secondary}} microplastics {{as well as}} macroplastics may enter the environment through wastewater. During the primary (mechanical) treatment step in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), coarse suspended or floating solids are removed from the wastewater by screens or sieves. Sand and other heavy particles are retained in sand traps; floating material is removed in <b>grease</b> <b>separators</b> [84]. Coarse screens have openings of approx. 20 – 50  mm, intermediate screens of approx. 10 – 20  mm and fine screens of approx. 2 – 10  mm [84, 85]. Such screens are suitable for removing macroplastics from wastewater [72, 86, 87], while they will—based on the opening sizes mentioned above—not be able to capture smaller microplastics. Still, microplastics may be captured, if other materials are clogging the screens. Mintenig et al. [31] suggested that buoyant microplastics may be removed in the grease separating step. Microplastics with a high density such as PU {{can be expected to}} sediment and, thus, to be captured in the sand trap or with the sludge.|$|R
40|$|<b>Grease</b> <b>separators</b> (GS) are {{the first}} {{preventive}} strategy to reduce the entry of fats, oils and grease (FOG) into the sewage system. Since its patent in 1883, very little has been developed {{in order to improve}} the function and maintenance of these devices. One of the strategies to upgrade the GS performance is through the use of bioaugmentative systems. However,limited scientific-based knowledge of the performance and bioaugmentation of GS is available to promote sound regulations regarding the use, maintenance and improvement of GSs in Sweden. Thus, an important consideration {{of this study was to}} evaluate the function of accepted GSs and the effects of bioaugmentative systems in its performance. <b>Grease</b> <b>separators</b> from three different food-producing establishments (FSEs) (one restaurant from an elementary school and two full service restaurants) located in Danderyd and Stockholm municipalities were evaluated. The GS of one of the full service restaurants was treated with a bioaugmentative system (GOR BioSystem™) and monitored for changes in the effluent quality and FOG accumulation compared to an untreated control period. This evaluation consisted of two cycles, lasting approximately one month (five weeks) each, which was in accordance to the regulation for the intervals between the pump outs in the Stockholm region. The GS from an elementary school in Danderyd municipality was treated and monitored for ten weeks with the same bioaugmentative system (GOR BioSystem™) while one untreated standard GS from a full service restaurant in Stockholm was monitored for five weeks as a control. Regular analysis including FOG (either ether soluble, emulsified and separable fat), biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids, pH,temperature, conductivity, grease cap thickness and bottom solids accumulation and odor was performed. In general, the chemical and physical parameters were similar in both treated and untreated cycles in the full service restaurant analyzed with and without the treatment with GOR BioSystemTM. However, lower levels of grease cap development and solids accumulation and odor were achieved in the treated cycle. No grease accumulation was detected in the GS bioaugmented for ten weeks while a considerable amount of both grease and solids accumulated in the control untreated GS after 25 activity days. There were no indications that the bioaugmentation promoted by GOR BioSystem™ led to a deterioration of the effluent quality or released additional amounts of oil and greases in the collection system. Furthermore, it is expected that the use of GOR BioSystem™ can improve the rationalization of the handling of organic waste with the reduction of waste transports...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} part of the project "Systems Analysis of Organic Waste", funded by the Swedish Waste Research Council (AFR). In the project a {{simulation}} model for analysing different scenarios of organic waste handling systems was constructed, ORWARE (ORganic WAste REsearch model). The results from simulations with ORWARE represent environmental impact and use of resources of the systems studied, i. e. energy and plant nutrients. The environmental impact depends on the contamination level of the waste that is treated. Also the distribution of the major constituents of the waste, such as carbohydrates, protein and fat, are of great importance for the performance of different biological treatments, compost, anaerobic digestion and sewage treatment, and thus of importance for both environmental impact and use of resources. The objective of this report was to present the indata used in the simulation experiments performed in the Uppsala case study. The amount and composition of the organic waste are presented. The method for gaining knowledge on these objects was mainly literature studies but also personal communications. Organic waste from the following sources are investigated; households, parks and gardens, restaurants and caterers, trade, slaughterhouse (Farmek), other industries (Slotts, Pharmacia, Nordmills and three industrialised bakeries) and finally <b>grease</b> <b>separators.</b> The ORWARE model uses a large number of different waste constituents, both major constituents and contaminants such as heavy metals and organic pollutants. In the simulation experiments all input data had to be specified. Thus, when we could not find the data we had to make assumptions The main result from this survey is that data concerning organic wastes are lacking, not only regarding contaminants but also the distribution of the main constituents and plant nutrients. One aspect that is relatively well investigated is the content of heavy metals in household waste and in waste from parks. More research is needed primarily concerning the content of major constituents, the nutritives, such as carbohydrates, fat, protein etc. This is urgent since performance of the biological treatment processes depend on the composition of the feedstock. The content of organic pollutants in waste is not well investigated. However, better input data concerning these pollutants would not much improve the simulation results, since very {{little is known about the}} fate of these substances in the treatment processes...|$|R
40|$|Removal of fats, {{oils and}} greases (FOG) from {{commercial}} food premises prior to discharge of wash waters into the sewer {{is critical in}} restricting blockage events. The FOG droplets that form are commonly removed in passive gravity separators. Enhanced separation through design modification, would allow a reduction in size required to achieve target removal. The aim {{of the project was}} to determine the feasibility of enhancing removal of FOGs in gravity separation devices and or in post treatment units. The thesis work examined the effect characteristics of oil droplet size and density had on FOG removal with a view to increasing droplet rise rates and hence separation. Examination of kitchen wastewater from a number of restaurants established that droplet sizes were typically in the mechanically emulsified oil size range, often with high zeta potential indicating electrostatic stabilisation of suspensions. Oil removal rates were examined using different oils typical of food preparations in laboratory scale experiments. Under a fixed energy input the different oils produced different droplet size distributions such that very different separation efficiencies were observed. The removal rates obtained allowed the prediction of oil removal from a sample in a given time when the median droplet size and density of the oil were known. For effective understanding of separator design and testing, droplet densities and sizes must be adequately measured and replicated. In addition, the light fuel oil used in the certification test produced very unstable suspensions, easily separable in the standard testing conditions, proving it a poor surrogate test material. Pre-formed droplets of sunflower oil were treated in a vertically aligned reaction chamber with an ultrasonic transducer fitted at the base. FOG removal, measured as HEM removal, was monitored as a function of power input, frequency, reactor size and residence time, the incoming flow entered counter currently to the ultrasonic wave propagation. The ultrasound treatment procedure removed 80 % of oil from a suspension of droplets in the mechanically emulsified oil size range {{during the course of a}} 54 minute continuous experiment compared to 20 - 30 % removal in the case of an equivalent separated without ultrasonic enhancement. The enhanced separation was found to be dependent on the power input and the reactor size. Application of ultrasound energy in modified <b>grease</b> <b>separators</b> to remove short-circuiting droplets would allow a reduction in overall size of units through reduced residence time requirement...|$|R
