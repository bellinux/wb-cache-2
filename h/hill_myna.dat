5|$|Kerala's fauna are {{notable for}} their {{diversity}} and {{high rates of}} endemism: it includes 118 species of mammals (1 endemic), 500 species of birds, 189 species of freshwater fish, 173 species of reptiles (10 of them endemic), and 151 species of amphibians (36 endemic). These are threatened by extensive habitat destruction, including soil erosion, landslides, salinisation, and resource extraction. In the forests, sonokeling, Dalbergia latifolia, anjili, mullumurikku, Erythrina, and Cassia number {{among the more than}} 1,000 species of trees in Kerala. Other plants include bamboo, wild black pepper, wild cardamom, the calamus rattan palm, and aromatic vetiver grass, Vetiveria zizanioides. Indian elephant, Bengal tiger, Indian leopard, Nilgiri tahr, common palm civet, and grizzled giant squirrels are also found in the forests. Reptiles include the king cobra, viper, python, and mugger crocodile. Kerala's birds include the Malabar trogon, the great hornbill, Kerala laughingthrush, darter and southern <b>hill</b> <b>myna.</b> In the lakes, wetlands, and waterways, fish such as kadu; stinging catfish and choottachi; orange chromideâ€”Etroplus maculatus are found.|$|E

2500|$|The {{northern}} and southern {{parts of the state}} are hilly, while the central part is a fertile plain. The highest point in the state is the Gaurlata.

2500|$|Research upon avian vocal motor neurons {{finds that}} they {{perceive}} their song {{as a series}} of articulatory gestures as in humans. Birds that can imitate humans, such as the Indian <b>hill</b> <b>myna</b> (Gracula religiosa), imitate human speech by mimicking the various speech formants, created by changing the shape of the human vocal tract, with different vibration frequencies of its internal tympaniform membrane. [...] Indian hill mynahs also imitate such phonetic characteristics as voicing, fundamental frequencies, formant transitions, nasalization, and timing, through their vocal movements are made in a different way from those of the human vocal apparatus.|$|E
2500|$|Starlings are {{medium-sized}} passerines. The shortest-bodied {{species is}} Kenrick's starling (Poeoptera kenricki), at 15 centimetres (6 in), but the lightest-weight species is Abbott's starling (Poeoptera femoralis), which is 34 grams (1.2 oz). The largest starling, going on standard measurements and perhaps weight, is the Nias <b>hill</b> <b>myna</b> (Gracula robusta). This species can {{measure up to}} [...] and, in domestication they can weigh up to [...] Rivalling the prior species in bulk if not dimensions, the mynas of the genus Mino are also large, especially the yellow-faced (M. dumontii) and long-tailed mynas (M. kreffti).

50|$|The Acridotheres mynas are {{generally}} dark or dull birds with and fluted calls like most starlings; the sexes are similar. They walk rather than hop, and have {{modifications to the}} skull and its muscles for open bill probing. They resemble the <b>hill</b> <b>mynas</b> (Gracula) with which they often co-occur, in having large white or buff wing patches which are obvious in flight and in some also naked areas on the head, but differ in that only the head plumage is glossy, and the underparts tend to be paler. The naked head patches are different in arrangement. Acridotheres mynas are also much more terrestrial than Gracula.|$|R
5000|$|The common <b>hill</b> <b>myna</b> (Gracula religiosa), {{sometimes}} spelled [...] "mynah" [...] and formerly simply {{known as}} <b>hill</b> <b>myna,</b> is the myna most commonly seen in aviculture, {{where it is}} often simply referred to by the latter two names. It {{is a member of}} the starling family (Sturnidae), resident in hill regions of South Asia and Southeast Asia. The Sri Lanka <b>hill</b> <b>myna,</b> a former subspecies of G. religiosa, is now generally accepted as a separate species G. ptilogenys. The Enggano <b>hill</b> <b>myna</b> (G. enganensis) and Nias <b>hill</b> <b>myna</b> (G. robusta) are also widely accepted as specifically distinct, and many authors favor treating the Southern <b>hill</b> <b>myna</b> (G. indica) from the Nilgiris and elsewhere in the Western Ghats of India as a separate species.|$|E
5000|$|The Enggano <b>hill</b> <b>myna</b> is stocky with mainly black plumage. It has bright orange-yellow {{patches of}} naked skin and fleshy yellow wattles {{on the side}} of its head and nape. At about 27 cm in length, it is {{somewhat}} smaller than the common <b>hill</b> <b>myna.</b>|$|E
50|$|Until {{recently}} {{only two}} species were recognised, G. religiosa and G. ptilogenys. Previously, all Gracula {{were considered to}} belong to a very variable species commonly called <b>hill</b> <b>myna.</b> Three additional subspecies of G. religiosa are increasingly being considered as distinct species. Formerly, the Sri Lanka <b>hill</b> <b>myna</b> was considered to be a subspecies of the common <b>hill</b> <b>myna,</b> but today all major authorities recognise them as separate. Comparably, the Enggano, Nias and Southern hill mynas have traditionally been treated as subspecies of the common hill myna; a treatment still preferred by some authorities.|$|E

Kerala has about 453 species of birds such as the Sri Lanka frogmouth (Batrachostomus moniliger), leaf picking bird, Oriental bay owl, large frugivores like the great hornbill (Buceros bicornis) and Indian grey hornbill, as well as the more widespread birds such as peafowl, Indian cormorant, jungle and <b>hill</b> <b>mynas,</b> the Oriental darter, black-hooded oriole, greater racket-tailed and black drongoes, bulbul (Pycnonotidae), species of kingfisher and woodpecker, jungle fowl, Alexandrine parakeets, and assorted ducks and migratory birds.
