For individuals with high risk of developing lung cancer, computed tomography (CT) screening can detect cancer and give a person options to respond to <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that prolongs life. This form of screening reduces the chance of death from lung cancer by an absolute amount of 0.3% (relative amount of 20%).

25|$|Frank Kermode {{has written}} that midrash is an imaginative way of 'updating, enhancing, augmenting, explaining, and {{justifying}} the sacred text'. Because the Tanakh became {{to be seen as}} unintelligible or even offensive, midrash {{could be used as a}} means of rewriting <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that both makes it more acceptable to later ethical standards and renders it less obviously implausible.|$|E

25|$|The {{uncertainty}} principle is not readily apparent on the macroscopic scales of everyday experience. So {{it is helpful}} to demonstrate how it applies to more easily understood physical situations. Two alternative frameworks for quantum physics offer different explanations for the {{uncertainty principle}}. The wave mechanics picture of the uncertainty principle is more visually intuitive, but the more abstract matrix mechanics picture formulates <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that generalizes more easily.|$|E
25|$|The Jerusalem Talmud is {{also the}} {{authority}} for the statement that Elisha played the part of an informer during the Hadrianic persecutions, when the Jews were ordered to violate {{the laws of the}} Torah.

25|$|The {{best known}} brand in strobe tuner {{technology}} is Peterson Tuners who in 1967 marketed their first strobe tuner, the Model 400. Other companies, such as Sonic Research, TC Electronic, and Planet Waves, sell highly accurate LED-based true strobe tuners. Other LED tuners have a 'strobe mode' that emulates {{the appearance of}} a strobe. However, the accuracy of these tuners in strobe mode, while sufficient for most tuning, is no better than in any other mode, as they use the same technique as any basic tuner to measure frequency, only displaying <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that imitates a strobe tuner.|$|E
25|$|The {{best thing}} {{was simply the}} {{privilege}} {{and the challenge of}} being able to take a shot at the first female captain, transcending stereotypes that I was very familiar with. I was able to do that in front of millions of viewers. That was a remarkable experience—and it continues to resonate. The downside of that is also that it continues to resonate, and threatens to eclipse all else in one's long career if one does not up the ante and stay at <b>it,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that may not ordinarily be necessary. I have to work at changing and constantly reinventing myself in a way that probably would not have happened had Star Trek not come along. I knew that going in, and I think that all of the perks attached to this journey have been really inexpressively great. So the negatives are small.|$|E
25|$|Higher {{authority}} is represented most clearly by Peter. What is more, he represents <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> which sets {{him apart from}} the mass of humanity and even (so Pushkin hints, as we shall see) from such run-of-the-mill autocrats as Alexander I. Only in the first twenty lines of the poem does Peter appear as a living person.The action then shifts forward abruptly by a hundred years, {{and the rest of}} the poem is set in a time when Peter is obviously long since dead. Yet despite this we have a sense throughout of Peter’s living presence, as if he had managed to avoid death in a quite unmortal way. The section evoking contemporary St Petersburg– Peter’s youthful creation, in which his spirit lives on–insinuates the first slight suggestion of this. Then comes a more explicit hint, as Pushkin voices the hope that the Finnish waves will not ‘disturb great Peter’s ageless sleep’. Peter, we must conclude, is not dead after all: he will awake from his sleep if danger should at any time threaten his capital city, the heart of the nation. Peter appears not as an ordinary human being but as an elemental force: he is an agent in the historical process, and even beyond this he participates in a wider cosmic struggle between order and disorder.|$|E

500|$|The term brostep {{has been}} used by some as a slight pejorative {{descriptor}} for a style of popular Americanised dubstep. US and Canadian artists often drew inspiration from British brostep producers who tended to work less with sub-bass and more with mid-range sounds such as Caspa, Rusko, and Vex'd. Rusko himself claimed in an interview on BBC Radio 1Xtra that [...] "brostep is sort of my fault, but now I've started to hate <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way...</b> It's like someone screaming in your face... you don't want that."
