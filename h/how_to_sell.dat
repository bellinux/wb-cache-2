500|$|Wood and Weiss {{argue over}} the film's title and subject matter: Weiss has the poster printed, which Wood changes to Glen or Glenda and writes the {{film about a}} {{transvestite}} rather than a sex change. Weiss allows Wood to shoot whatever he wants {{as long as the}} film meets the required length. [...] Wood takes to film production with an unusual approach; shooting only one take per scene, giving actors very little direction and using stock footage to fill in gaps. [...] The movie is released to critical and commercial failure. Because of this, Wood is unsuccessful in getting a job at Screen Classics, but his girlfriend, Dolores Fuller, tells him that he should try financing his next film independently. Wood is unsuccessful in finding money for Bride of the Atom, but is introduced to the psychic The Amazing Criswell who gives him advice on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> himself better.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} largely {{neglected}} by the record label, which {{did little to}} no promotion in the US. Pearlman stated that [...] "there was actually no intention {{on the part of}} Columbia Records at all to promote it. (...) Basically the people wanted to work it and they were told not to work it". Roeser commented later that he did not [...] "think Sony’s ever really known <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> us, from the beginning (...) and Columbia never felt that they knew how to market us". Imaginos fared better with CBS International, which distributed the album abroad and produced a music video for [...] "Astronomy" [...] in the UK, which aired in coincidence with the European tour dates of 1989. The video clip does not feature members of the band, but begins with the spoken introduction by Stephen King and focuses on the storyline narrated in the album.|$|E
500|$|Taraborrelli {{commented that}} [...] "in the end, the events {{surrounding}} 'Like a Prayer' only served to enhance Madonna's reputation as a shrewd businesswoman, someone who knows <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> a concept." [...] Before Madonna's deal with Pepsi, pop stars in general were not given much artistic freedom by sponsors. However, Madonna {{made it a point}} to have the commercial be dictated by her. While she said that it was never her intention for Pepsi to get entangled in the controversy of the music video, Taraborrelli observed that Madonna stayed true to herself. Although the commercial intended to promote Pepsi the soft drink, she did not bother to hold even a can of the product, leading the author to comment that [...] "Madonna the pop star was going to do it her way, no matter what Madonna the businesswoman had agreed to do". She maintained all along that the Pepsi commercial and the music video were two different commodities and she was right to stand her ground. Taraborrelli noted that after [...] "Like a Prayer", the recruitment of pop stars and athletes to sell soft drinks became commonplace. However, none of them generated the level of excitement on par with Pepsi's failed deal with Madonna.|$|E

2500|$|At first, the Rio album {{did not do}} well in the United States. EMI in the UK had {{promoted}} Duran Duran as a New Romantic band, but the New Romantic {{movement was}} barely known in the US, and EMI's American subsidiary Capitol Records was at a loss about <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> them. After Carnival (an EP of Rio's dance remixes) became popular with DJs in the fall, the band arranged to have most of the album remixed by David Kershenbaum.

2500|$|B.J. Palmer {{believed}} that their chiropractic school was founded on [...] "…a business, not a professional basis. We manufacture chiropractors. We teach them the idea and then we show them <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> it". The next 15 years saw the opening of 30 more chiropractic schools, including John Howard's National School of Chiropractic (now the National University of Health Sciences) that moved to Chicago, Illinois. Each school attempted to develop its own identity, while B.J. Palmer continued to develop the philosophy behind his father's discovery. Fueled by the persistent and provocative advertising of recent chiropractic graduates, local medical communities, who had {{the power of the}} state at their disposal, immediately had them arrested. There were only 12,000 practicing chiropractors with more than 15,000 prosecutions for practicing medicine without a license in the first 30 years. D.D. Palmer was also jailed for practicing medicine without a license. Tom Morris and his partner, Fred Hartwell, were able to successfully defend 80% through the UCA.

2500|$|According to Douglas Kellner, {{the album}} and its singles were {{particularly}} influential {{on the music}} video field. The video for the title track [...] "Like a Prayer", which depicted Madonna as a witness to a murder of a white girl by white supremacists, Catholic symbols such as stigmata, Ku Klux Klan-style cross burning, and a dream about kissing a black saint, was extremely controversial and gained {{a great deal of}} attention. Jon Pareles wrote that the video [...] "set a media circus in motion, stirring up just those issues of sexuality and religiosity that Madonna wanted to bring up". The Vatican condemned the video while critics accused it of sacrilege and heresy. Madonna commented, [...] "Art should be controversial, and that's all there is to it." [...] Taraborrelli wrote that the song and its video also served to enhance Madonna's reputation as [...] "a shrewd businesswoman, someone who knows <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> a concept." [...] Stewart M. Hoover wrote that the music video pushed boundaries by [...] "bringing traditional religious imagery into the popular music context". Similarly, Daniel Welsh from The Huffington Post, wrote that the video [...] "catapulted Madonna to the ranks of music video heavyweight, and proved to the world she really meant business". The music video for [...] "Express Yourself" [...] was also noted by critics for its exploitation of female sexuality and {{came to the conclusion that}} Madonna's masculine image in the video was gender-bending; authors Santiago Fouz-Hernández and Freya Jarman-Ivens commented that [...] "the video portrayed the deconstructive gender-bending approach associated with free play and self-reflexivity of images in postmodernism." [...] Author John Semonche explained in his book Censoring sex that with True Blue and Like a Prayer, Madonna pushed the envelope of what could be shown on television, which resulted in increase of her popularity.|$|E
2500|$|Although several makeup effects {{companies}} were considered, 20th Century Fox chose Stan Winston Studios. Stan Winston was not {{directly involved in}} the pre-production, but left the task to his top artists–Alec Gillis, Shane Mahan, John Rosengrant and Tom Woodruff. Producer Gale Anne Hurd commented on [...] creating the foundation for the makeup setting saying, [...] "The primary problem was <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> an alien race that was humanoid without making it look like people in rubber suits—and how to make it affordable. We knew {{there was going to be}} a lot of makeup application time and removal time—that was a given." [...] Artist Gillis recalled his involvement in the project saying, [...] "We were involved in everything from designing and sculpting the aliens to supervising a crew of about thirty people. We sculpted the main characters, supervised the molding and production of their appliances and oversaw the sculpting of the secondary and background characters." [...] During the design phase, the producers supported the subtlety of the makeup and trying to make the aliens look as human as possible. Hurd explained, [...] "We wanted the aliens to be more like a different ethnic race than like lizard people, ..." [...] She added, [...] "We didn't want our audiences thinking, 'Gee, look how different these aliens are.' Rather, after about five minutes we wanted the audience to accept them as different from us, but not so different that no one is buying the storyline. We wanted the aliens to be characters–not creatures." [...] A preliminary design sketch for the aliens as described by Mahan, was that [...] "the males were going to have spines on top of their heads–kind of like a rooster's comb–and when they got angry, these spines would raise up. That would've required a mechanical headpiece, and Graham Baker thought it was a little too extreme so we went with smooth heads instead." [...] Coming close to a final design for the headpiece makeup, Woodruff explained how the masks had [...] "heavier brows and a heavier skin texture that looked more leathery, and there were more pronounced lumps on the backs of their heads. After we went into production on these masks, Graham Baker decided that he wanted the aliens to look even more subtle, so we streamlined the design once we started doing the principal characters." [...] Mike Spatola was head of the painting crew for the mask design. Hairless by design, the coordinators felt the masks should have spotted marks where hair would be present on humans. Each alien headpiece had to be custom painted with a spotting pattern to match every backup secondary piece used for individual characters. Each of the actors who played aliens also had their hands painted in a spot pattern, as an original plan of supplying them with appliances for hand pieces was discarded.|$|E
