5|$|Members of {{the breed}} were {{originally}} used as hunting dogs, but increased in popularity {{as a show}} dog.

5|$|The breed is the {{smallest}} of the sporting dogs recognised by the AKC, and its distinctly shaped head makes it immediately recognisable. In addition, there are some marked differences between it and its English relative. It is a happy breed with average working intelligence, although by being bred to a show standard it is no longer an <b>ideal</b> <b>working</b> dog. Members of the breed suffer {{from a wide variety of}} health ailments including problems with their hearts, eyes and ears.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>ideal</b> <b>working</b> {{stock has}} {{the grain of}} the wood running {{parallel}} to the shaving horse, and perpendicular to the blade of the drawknife, so that the drawknife shaves away the entire wood fibre and does not cut against it. [...] It is best not pulled with blade perfectly perpendicular to the wood stock, but pulled slightly upward toward them in a skewed (blade at a slight diagonal) or slithering fashion, aiming not to take off as much wood as possible, but gradually [...] "shave" [...] the work. The operator gently levers the blade to [...] "bite" [...] into the wood and then controls the depth of the cut by raising or lowering the handles as they pull the drawknife towards them.|$|E
2500|$|The Newfoundland dog {{is known}} for its calm and docile nature and its [...] strength. They are highly loyal and make <b>ideal</b> <b>working</b> dogs. It {{is for this reason that}} this breed is known as [...] "the gentle giant". International kennel clubs {{generally}} describe the breed as having a sweet temper. It typically has a deep bark, and is easy to train if started young. They are wonderfully good with children, but small children can get accidentally leaned on and knocked down. Newfoundlands are ideal companions in the world of therapy and are often referred to as the nanny dog. The breed was memorialized in [...] "Nana", the beloved guardian dog in J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan. The Newfoundland in general is good with other animals, but its size can cause problems if it is not trained.|$|E
50|$|Filming {{was done}} entirely outdoors, {{including}} interior scenes which were shot on sets built outside {{and topped with}} cotton screens to control the sunlight.

6000|$|... "My {{father is}} a cobbler," [...] said Hill, quite irrelevantly, and {{perceived}} the want of dignity even as he said it. But the gleam of jealousy did not offend her. She conceived herself the fundamental source of it. He suffered bitterly {{from a sense of}} Wedderburn's unfairness, and a realisation of his own handicap. Here was this Wedderburn had picked up a prominent man for a father, and instead of his losing so many marks on the score of that advantage, it was counted to him for righteousness! And while Hill had to introduce himself and talk to Miss Haysman clumsily over mangled guinea-pigs in the laboratory, this Wedderburn, in some backstairs way, had access to her social altitudes, and could converse in a polished argot that Hill understood perhaps, but felt incapable of speaking. Not, of course, that he wanted to. Then it seemed to Hill that for Wedderburn to come there day after day with cuffs unfrayed, neatly tailored, precisely barbered, quietly perfect, was in itself an ill-bred, sneering sort of proceeding. Moreover, it was a stealthy thing for Wedderburn to behave insignificantly for a space, to mock modesty, to lead Hill to fancy that he himself was beyond dispute the man of the year, and then suddenly to dart in front of him, and incontinently to swell up in this fashion. In addition to these things, Wedderburn displayed an increasing disposition to join in any conversational grouping that included Miss Haysman, and would venture, and indeed seek occasion, to pass opinions derogatory to socialism and atheism. He goaded Hill to incivilities by neat, shallow, and exceedingly effective personalities about the socialist leaders, until Hill hated Bernard Shaw's graceful egotisms, William Morris's limited editions and luxurious wall-papers, and Walter Crane's charmingly absurd <b>ideal</b> <b>working</b> men, about as much as he hated Wedderburn. The dissertations in the laboratory, that had been his glory in the previous term, became a danger, degenerated into inglorious tussels with Wedderburn, and Hill kept to them only out of an obscure perception that his honour was involved. In the debating society Hill knew quite clearly that, to a thunderous accompaniment of banged desks, he could have pulverised Wedderburn. Only Wedderburn never attended the debating society to be pulverised, because--nauseous affectation!--he [...] "dined late." ...|$|E

40|$|Through a {{case study}} of a London borough's children's social {{services}} department (CSD), this article highlights themes concerning the reorganization of children's social care provision. Reorganizations have been driven in part by tensions between the desire of social work professionals to maintain their autonomous modes of working, versus an increasingly managerialist outlook of more recent government initiatives. The acceptance and incorporation of managerialist <b>ideals</b> into <b>working</b> practices may be driven by a climate of greater risk aversion, leading to creeping risk management across CSDs...|$|R

50|$|Other {{research}} has demonstrated that the relationship between job satisfaction and turnover is fully mediated by intention to quit; workers who report low job satisfaction are likely to engage in planned quitting. However, this relationship does not account for employees who report high job satisfaction, but quit unexpectedly. Although extrinsic rewards, such as better job offers outside their current organization, may influence their decisions, employees' personality factors may also impact their decisions to exit early from otherwise ideal jobs under <b>ideal</b> <b>working</b> conditions.|$|E

60|$|They {{were his}} fellow-citizens gone wrong because of {{imperfect}} education, Chief Inspector Heat believed; but allowing for that difference, he could understand {{the mind of}} a burglar, because, as a matter of fact, the mind and the instincts of a burglar are of the same kind as the mind and the instincts of a police officer. Both recognise the same conventions, and have a working knowledge of each other’s methods and of the routine of their respective trades. They understand each other, which is advantageous to both, and establishes a sort of amenity in their relations. Products of the same machine, one classed as useful and the other as noxious, they take the machine for granted in different ways, but with a seriousness essentially the same. The mind of Chief Inspector Heat was inaccessible to ideas of revolt. But his thieves were not rebels. His bodily vigour, his cool inflexible manner, his courage and his fairness, had secured for him much respect and some adulation in the sphere of his early successes. He had felt himself revered and admired. And Chief Inspector Heat, arrested within six paces of the anarchist nick-named the Professor, gave a thought of regret to the world of thieves—sane, without morbid <b>ideals,</b> <b>working</b> by routine, respectful of constituted authorities, free from all taint of hate and despair.|$|R

The Knights of Labor originally served as a secret organization for Philadelphia garment workers but was transformed into an association with the objective of promoting the labour reform movement from a uniform position.

At Beatrice Estate, which is another plantation near Elopura, Pryer experimented with the cultivation of new products.

It is primarily used to move material short distances or through challenging terrain. The vehicle is powerful, yet small and light 16 to 20 t (18 to 23 short tons) depending on configuration).
