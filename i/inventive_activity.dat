40|$|Canadian {{urban and}} {{regional}} patent and trademark data was analysed between 1881 and 1986 {{in an attempt}} to distinguish spatial inventive patterns in Canada over time. <b>Inventive</b> <b>activity,</b> as a pre—condition for economic development, is a viable indicator for predicting future economic growth in an inventive spatial economy. As such, {{it will be possible to}} extend the description of spatial inventive patterns in Canada after 1986. The percentage and relative level of <b>inventive</b> <b>activity</b> in urban centers and regions in Canada will help distinguish spatial inventive patterns in Canada over time. This information was based on a 25 percent systematic sample of registered Canadian patents and trademarks between 1881 and 1986. <b>Inventive</b> <b>activity</b> was also compared to population growth and unemployment levels {{in an attempt to}} discern the relationship between <b>inventive</b> <b>activity</b> and urban growth. This analysis compared the number of inventions per 10, 000 population in 1981 to the percentage of population growth between 1981 and 1986 and unemployment levels in 1986 for twenty-four major Census Metropolitan Areas in Canada. It was found that the Canadian inventive spatial economy is very dynamic. However, an overall pattern of concentration was detected. For example, inventive impulses in the Maritime region was lacking after 1911. In the west, impulses of varying intensity were evident over time and space. Most of Canada 2 ̆ 7 s healthy <b>inventive</b> <b>activity</b> was found in Central Canada. Further, the core region lost some of its inventive importance during the post-war years, however, between 1981 and 1986, this region experienced traditionally high levels of <b>inventive</b> <b>activity.</b> Also, there was a noticeable pattern of inventive concentration towards higher ordered places in the Canadian urban hierarchy, and a rationalization of Canada 2 ̆ 7 s core region from a Quebec City to Windsor axis to a Toronto to Kitchener—waterloo axis with a trunk line towards Hamilton and two island impulses in Montreal and Ottawa. Lastly, there was a positive and significant relationship between <b>inventive</b> <b>activity</b> and urban growth, lending support to the notion that recent inventive concentration in the core region of Canada can be expected to continue well into the next decade...|$|E

Our data source is the "R&D 100 Awards" competition organized by the journal Research and Development. Since 1963, the magazine (which at that time was called Industrial Research) has been awarding this prize to 100 most technologically significant new products available for sale or licensing in the year preceding the judgment. The jury is composed of university professors, industrial researchers and consultants with a certified level of competence in the specific areas they are called to asses. The main criteria for assessment are: i) technological significance (i. e., whether the product can be considered a major breakthrough), ii) competitive significance (i. e., how the product compares to rival solutions available on the market). Throughout the years, key breakthroughs inventions such as Polacolor film (1963), the flashcube (1965), the automated teller machine (1973), the halogen lamp (1974), the fax machine (1975), the liquid crystal display (1980), the printer (1986), the Kodak Photo CD (1991), the Nicoderm antismoking patch (1992), Taxol anticancer drug (1993), lab on a chip (1996), and HDTV (1998) have received the prize. We use these data to study the shifts in the distribution of innovative activities across countries, sectors and types of institutions and the changes in the sources of <b>inventive</b> <b>activities</b> over time. Our preliminary findings show: i) the emergence of a challenge to US technological leadership from other rival nations such as Japan and Germany, ii) the critical role of scientific instrumentation as a powerful source of technological breakthroughs, iii) a change in the institutional arrangements where innovative activities take place, from individual corporations, to partnerships increasingly involving public research organizations and universities, iv) a large chunk of <b>inventive</b> <b>activities</b> undertaken without patent protection. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the effect of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) on the profile of merging firms’ <b>inventive</b> <b>activity.</b> The authors conceive of the inventive process as a recombinant search, whose outcome can be characterized along two complementary dimensions, which define its profile: its depth of impact on subsequent inventions, and its breadth of impact across different scientific domains. The profile of firms’ <b>inventive</b> <b>activity</b> depends on two main factors: the resources available to be recombined and the organizational incentives that guide the recombination process. In turn, these factors significantly depend on the upstream, technological resources available and on firms’ downstream, product-market related assets. Importantly, both of these factors may change {{in the aftermath of}} M&A, as their specific institutional features facilitate the exchange and redeployment of upstream and downstream resources. The authors then discuss how variations in the profile of firms’ <b>inventive</b> <b>activity</b> in the aftermath of an M&A reflect the diversity of upstream and downstream resources redeployed by the M&A deal. They test their hypotheses with a panel of firms from the US medical devices and photographic equipment industry. The study finds that diversity in merging firms’ downstream resources exerts a positive impact on post-acquisition profile of inventive activities, whereas diversity in knowledge bases does not seem to exert a significant direct effect on the two qualitative dimensions of <b>inventive</b> <b>activity</b> considered. Yet, technological diversity displays a positive effect in deals characterized by high market relatedness...|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims to {{fill the}} gap in the {{literature}} by examining the relationship between technological trajectories and environmental policy in the automotive industry, focusing on the role of environmental policies in unlocking the industry from fossil fuel path-dependence. It first explores the inducement mechanism that underpins the interaction between environmental policy and green technological advances, investigating under what conditions the European environmental transport policy portfolio and the intrinsic characteristics of assignees' knowledge boost worldwide green patent production. Subsequently, the thesis empirically analyses the dynamics of technological knowledge involved in technological trajectories assessing evolution patterns such as variation, selection and retention, in order to study the impact of policy implementation on technological knowledge related to electric and hybrid vehicle technologies. Finally, the thesis sheds light on the drivers that encourage a shift from incumbent internal combustion engine technologies towards low-emission vehicle technologies. This analysis tests whether tax-inclusive fuel prices and technological proximity between technological fields induce a shift from non-environmental inventions to environmentally friendly <b>inventive</b> <b>activities</b> and if they impact the competition between alternative vehicle technologies. The findings provide insights into the effectiveness of environmental policy in triggering <b>inventive</b> <b>activities</b> related to the development of alternative vehicle technologies. In addition, there is evidence that environmental policy redirects technological efforts towards a sustainable path and impacts the competition between low-emission vehicles. ...|$|R
