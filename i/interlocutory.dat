5|$|Since {{this case}} {{challenged}} {{the authority of}} the federal courts to try Indian-on-Indian crime, this case was heard as an <b>interlocutory</b> appeal, meaning that the Supreme Court would have to decide the constitutionality of the claimed jurisdiction before Kagama could be tried for the killing of Iyouse in federal court.|$|E
5|$|Chotiner {{continued}} to practice law. In 1962, his wife Ruth obtained an <b>interlocutory</b> divorce decree against him. After the decree became final, Chotiner married again in 1965. In January 1966, attorney and land developer Charles W. Hinman {{was arrested and}} charged with plotting to have Chotiner murdered. Chotiner had represented Hinman's wife in a contested divorce case, and Hinman had been jailed for eleven days for failure to pay his fees. No actual attempt on his life took place. Hinman was sentenced to between one and five years in prison. In 1957, one of Chotiner's divorce clients had been killed along with her daughter by the client's estranged husband in the attorney's Beverly Hills office.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Al-Kateb {{appealed the}} {{decision}} against {{him to a}} Full Court of the Federal Court, hoping that the reasoning applied in the Al Masri case (which was factually similar to his situation) would be applied to him. The appeal was removed into the High Court {{at the request of}} the then Attorney-General of Australia Daryl Williams, under provisions of the Judiciary Act 1903. Pending the appeal, Al-Kateb was released in April 2003, by an <b>interlocutory</b> consent order of the Federal Court. The case was argued alongside two other cases which also concerned immigration detention and hearings were held on 12 November and 13 November 2003.|$|E
5|$|Smallpeice {{and seven}} {{of his fellow}} {{directors}} felt {{there was no other}} course of action left open to them but to ask Rowland to relinquish all executive appointments with Lonrho, but to allow him to remain on the board as a non-executive director. Rowland refused and the eight directors prepared to pass a motion at the first full board meeting, set for 18 April 1973, forcing Rowland to relinquish all of his executive appointments. Rowland, aware of the possibility, had obtained an <b>interlocutory</b> injunction from the High Court of Justice preventing the board from voting on his removal.|$|E
5|$|The Secretary filed a suitUnited States v. Mainefor $150,000,000 {{in damages}} {{on behalf of}} the Passamaquoddy on July 1, 1972. The Penobscot Tribe voted to join the lawsuit late June, and the Secretary filed a second lawsuit, for the same amount, {{on behalf of the}} Penobscot on July 17one day before the statute of {{limitations}} would have expired. A few hours before the statutory period was due to expire the next day, Congress extended it for 90 daysthe {{first of a series of}} such extensions. United States v. Maine was stayed, pending the resolution of Passamaquoddy v. Morton. Further, proceedings in the district court were put on hold until the First Circuit dismissed the Secretary's <b>interlocutory</b> appeal from Judge Gignoux's preliminary order in 1973.|$|E
25|$|Later however, five {{judges of}} the Supreme Court convened and granted Tun Salleh Abas an <b>interlocutory</b> order against the tribunal.

The gate leading to the Parliament however was locked and Tun Salleh Abas' representative had to call in the police to be guaranteed a passage into the Parliament. Eventually, the order was presented to the tribunal chairman.|$|E

25|$|Oakie {{was married}} twice. His first {{marriage}} to Venita Varden in 1936 ended in 1938 when Venita got an <b>interlocutory</b> decree of divorce.

25|$|Arbitrators are {{generally}} unable to enforce <b>interlocutory</b> measures against a party, {{making it easier}} for a party to take steps to avoid enforcement of member or a small group of members in arbitration due to increasing legal fees, without explaining to the members the adverse consequences of an unfavorable ruling.|$|E
25|$|In {{a highly}} publicized 2002 case, Justice Robert McKinnon granted an <b>interlocutory</b> {{injunction}} ordering that Marc Hall be allowed to bring a same-sex date to prom at his Oshawa, Ontario Catholic high school. The matter did not, however, proceed to trial, meaning no binding judgment {{on the merits of}} the case was issued.|$|E
25|$|Arnaz and Lucille Ball {{were married}} on November 30, 1940. Their {{marriage}} was turbulent. Convinced that Arnaz was being unfaithful to her, {{and also because}} he came home drunk several times, Ball filed for divorce in September 1944, but returned to him before the <b>interlocutory</b> decree became final. Arnaz and Ball subsequently had two children, actress Lucie Arnaz (born 1951) and actor Desi Arnaz, Jr. (born 1953).|$|E
25|$|Generally counsel {{dress in}} the {{traditional}} English manner (wig, gown, and jabot) before superior courts, although this is not usually done for <b>interlocutory</b> applications. Wigs and robes are still worn in the Supreme Court and the District Court in civil matters and {{is dependent on the}} judicial officer's attire. Robes and wigs are worn in all criminal cases. In Western Australia, wigs are no longer worn in any court.|$|E
25|$|Mitsubishi's {{response}} was {{a motion to}} the judge to compel arbitration as mandated by the agreement. The court ordered most of the contractual claims arbitrated, but reserved jurisdiction on the statutory claims alleged by Soler, including antitrust. Soler made an <b>interlocutory</b> appeal to the First Circuit Court of Appeals, whose jurisdiction includes Puerto Rico, arguing that all its statutory counterclaims were {{not covered by the}} arbitration clause, and that Sherman Act claims could not be arbitrated in any event.|$|E
25|$|A {{single judge}} hears and decides cases in {{ordinary}} and summary proceedings {{as well as}} in small claims cases. A panel of three judges decides cases of great importance in ordinary proceedings as well as appeals or <b>interlocutory</b> appeals from the summary and small claims proceedings. Criminal cases are decided by a panel of three judges, with the exception of summary proceedings which may be held by a single judge. The Juvenile Court hears and decides only cases involving juveniles.|$|E
25|$|After {{a series}} of <b>interlocutory</b> {{hearings}} over the discovery of documents that took more than seven months, the matter finally came before Justice Harun Hashim in the Kuala Lumpur High Court on 4 February 1988. The judge ruled that under the existing law he had {{no option but to}} find the party, UMNO, to be an unlawful society due to the existence of several unregistered branchesâ€”an illegal act under the Societies Act of 1966. The question of the Assembly itself being illegal therefore became academic.|$|E
25|$|The Parties {{appealed to}} this Court. The Independent Party {{immediately}} sought <b>interlocutory</b> relief from MR. JUSTICE STEWART, which he granted by order after a hearing at which Ohio represented {{that it could}} place the Party's name on the ballot without disrupting the election if {{there was not a}} long delay. Several days after that order the Socialist Labor Party sought a stay which he denied because of that Party's failure to move quickly for relief, the State having represented that at that time the granting of relief would disrupt the election.|$|E
25|$|The {{defendants}} {{filed an}} <b>interlocutory</b> {{appeal to the}} Second Circuit, which heard oral arguments in the case {{near the end of}} the year. Chief Judge Thomas Walter Swan (no relation to defendant) was joined on the panel by Harrie Brigham Chase and Charles Edward Clark. They handed down their split decision early the following year. Swan and Chase had agreed, overturning the district court and holding the arbitration clause enforceable. Clark agreed with Goddard that the underlying policy considerations precluded that outcome, and did not require the specificity the majority demanded.|$|E
25|$|The Office of Administrative Law Judges (OALJ) is {{responsible}} for conducting hearings ordered by the Commission. The hearing function includes acting on <b>interlocutory</b> requests filed in the proceedings such as petitions to intervene, petitions to enlarge issues, and contested discovery requests. An Administrative Law Judge, appointed under the Administrative Procedure Act, presides at the hearing during which documents and sworn testimony are received in evidence, and witnesses are cross-examined.

25|$|The Kridakhanda of the Ganesha Purana narrates {{the stories}} of four incarnations (Avatars) of Ganesha, each for the four {{different}} yugas.

Chapter 138 through 148 present the Ganesha Gita, followed by a short section on Kali Yuga (current era) in chapter 149. The rest of chapter 149 through chapter 155 are <b>interlocutory,</b> following the literary requirements of a valid Puranic genre.|$|E
25|$|Shortly thereafter, Velez met actor Johnny Weissmuller {{while the}} two were in New York. After they both {{returned}} to Los Angeles, they dated off and on while VÃ©lez also dated actor Errol Flynn. On October 8, 1933, VÃ©lez and Weissmuller were married in Las Vegas. This relationship was also stormy with reports of domestic violence and public fights. In July 1934, after ten months of marriage, VÃ©lez filed for divorce citing cruelty. She withdrew the petition a week later after reconciling with Weissmuller. On January 3, 1935, she filed for divorce a second time and was granted an <b>interlocutory</b> decree. That decree was dismissed when the couple reconciled a month later. In August 1938, VÃ©lez filed for divorce {{for a third time}} again charging Weissmuller with cruelty. Their divorce was finalized in August 1939.|$|E
25|$|When hearing an appeal, the Court of Appeal {{normally}} {{sits with}} a bench of three Judges of Appeal, {{one of whom}} is the Chief Justice. If necessary though, such as in cases of unusual difficulty or importance, the bench may comprise five or any greater uneven number of judges. Certain appeals, including those against <b>interlocutory</b> orders, may be heard by only two judges. Matters before the Court are decided according to the opinion {{of the majority of the}} members of the Court hearing the case. If there are only two judges hearing an appeal and they disagree, the appeal is dismissed and the decision appealed against stands. Proceedings in the High Court are heard before a single judge, unless otherwise provided by any written law. A Judge of Appeal may also sit in the High Court as a Judge.|$|E
25|$|Around that time, {{the dispute}} {{eventually}} {{heard by the}} Supreme Court as Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., the first case to consider Wilko and its applicability to the 1934 Act, was beginning. Alberto-Culver, the Illinois-based manufacturer of personal care products, filed suit in the Northern District of Illinois after finding that the German trademarks Fritz Scherk had sold them were seriously encumbered. They refused Scherk's demand to arbitrate the claim before the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris per the contract, claiming {{fraud in the inducement}} as well as a waiver of their American statutory rights. After the district court denied Scherk's motion for a stay to do so the Seventh Circuit heard his <b>interlocutory</b> appeal. Since the transaction had also involved a transfer of stock, Alberto-Culver further argued that Wilko barred them from being forced to arbitrate.|$|E
25|$|This set {{the stage}} for {{confidential}} negotiations between Auckland's mayor Dick Hubbard and the investors, who on 31 August 2005 (now known as 'Matiatia Day' on the island) sold the stock in WIL to the city for $12.5 million. The unanimous vote on 30 June 2005 of the City Council to approve the purchase was said to have come about because of the unity of the people of Waiheke Island. The court case finally was concluded with permitted development set at 10,000 m2 of mixed use gross floor development. The Court also found Auckland City Council and WIL liable for costs in relationship to the <b>interlocutory</b> judgement. Since WIL was now owned by Council, it had to write a cheque to CAPOW for $18,000, representing 75% of CAPOW's costs on that matter. This final cheque allowed CAPOW to pay all its debts and balance its books.|$|E
25|$|In general, the Court hears civil appeals {{from any}} High Court {{judgment}} or order. These can be {{decisions made by}} the High Court when exercising its original jurisdiction (in other words, cases beginning in the High Court itself) or its appellate jurisdiction (cases appealed to the High Court from the State Courts). However, this general rule is subject {{to a number of}} restrictions. No appeal may be brought from certain <b>interlocutory</b> orders made by the High Court, when a judgment or order is made with the parties' consent, and where a statute declares that a judgment or order of the High Court is final. In some other cases, an appeal may only be brought with the leave of a High Court judge. These include cases where the amount or value of the subject-matter at the trial was S$250,000 or less, and High Court appeals concerning the adoption of children, the making of protection orders to prevent family violence, and maintenance for wives and children.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{may also}} sit {{with just two}} Judges of Appeal in appeals in civil matters against <b>interlocutory</b> orders and other orders apart from {{judgments}} handed down after trials commenced by writs of summons or hearings commenced by other originating processes such as originating summons. High Court judges may be requested by the Chief Justice to sit as judges of the Court of Appeal to hear specific appeals. Judges of Appeals cannot sit {{as members of the}} Court when appeals are against judgments or orders made by them, convictions made or a sentences passed by them, or questions of law reserved by them for the Court of Appeal to decide when they were acting as High Court judges. If the Court feels it requires assistance in a particular case, it may summon persons of skill and experience in the matter to which the proceedings relate to sit with the Court and act as assessors.|$|E
25|$|On 20 March, council leader Hilda Kean {{declared}} that the council would be bankrupt {{by the middle of}} April if unable to set a rate and abjured the use of creative accounting to evade the cap. The council slightly softened its policy on 28 March, declaring that it was only deferring making a rate and committing to making a legal rate in due course; a motion to stick to the previous formula was defeated by 32 to 24. The council having ignored the High Court's <b>interlocutory</b> declaration, Mourad Fleming's judicial review application proceeded to trial on 1 April; Fleming agreed to vary an order and let the council use borrowing powers in the 1985/86 financial year, but said that he would ask the court to appoint a receiver to run the council if no rate was set. At the end of the hearing, Mr Justice Woolf found both Hackney's resolutions of 7 and 28 March unlawful and quashed them but refused to immediately order the council to set a rate. Instead he adjourned the case to 16 April.|$|E
25|$|Administration of the Supreme Court {{is managed}} by its registry, which handles {{matters such as}} {{receiving}} and storing court documents filed in the court, and ensuring they are transmitted to judges for use during hearings. The Registry is headed by the Registrar who is assisted by the Deputy Registrar, Senior Assistant Registrars and Assistant Registrars. These officers are appointed by the President on the Chief Justice's recommendation, and {{are members of the}} Judicial Branch of the Singapore Legal Service. In addition to their administrative responsibilities, registrars deal with certain types of court proceedings in chambers, such as the assessment of damages, hearings of bankruptcy petitions and applications, <b>interlocutory</b> matters and pre-trial conferences. Registrars are also appointed as district judges or magistrates, which enables them to conduct preliminary inquiries to determine whether there are enough grounds for trying accused persons for criminal offences in the High Court. The Registry is also staffed by commissioners for oaths, interpreters, clerks and process servers. Justices' law clerks, who work directly under the Chief Justice's charge, assist Judges and Judicial Commissioners with legal research, particularly for Court of Appeal matters.|$|E
500|$|The {{certificate}} of division procedure had unique features. Unlike writ of error and certiorari jurisdiction, the {{certificate of}} division procedure {{did not require}} a federal question. In criminal cases, the certificate of division was {{the only source of}} appellate jurisdiction from the circuit courts (save original habeas) until 1889. In civil cases, although ordinary writs of error were authorized, the certificate of division remained important [...] because it permitted appeals without regard to the amount in controversy and <b>interlocutory</b> appeals. Inasmuch as the certificate of division permitted the Supreme Court some measure of control over its docket, it is a precursor to modern certiorari jurisdiction.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 1979 Act, arbitrators {{were allowed}} to make <b>interlocutory</b> orders penalising parties who failed to follow the arbitrator's {{timetable}} or requests; there was, however, no effective enforcement mechanism. Section 5 of the Act allows the High Court to intervene; if a party fails to comply, the High Court may (on {{the application of the}} arbitrator or any other party) order the arbitrator to continue as if the offending party was not there; he can immediately issue an award without considering their missing submission or failure to appear. Section 6 amends the 1950 Act, which required any two arbitrators hearing a case to immediately appoint an umpire. This caused unnecessary delay and expenditure. Section 6 instead provides that arbitrators can choose to appoint an umpire at any point, but must do [...] "forthwith" [...] if they fundamentally disagree.|$|E
500|$|The Act {{completely}} {{abolished the}} [...] "Case Stated" [...] procedure {{and other forms}} of judicial interference, replacing it with a limited system of appeal to the High Court of Justice and Court of Appeal of England and Wales; it also allowed for exclusion agreements limiting the rights of parties to arbitration to appeal to the courts, and gave arbitrators the ability to enforce <b>interlocutory</b> orders. Academics met the Act with a mixed response; while some praised it for bringing English law more into line with that of other nations, others criticised the wording used as unnecessarily complex and hazy. The Act did, in the eyes of some commentators, lead to a shift in judicial policy away from legal certainty and towards a system focused on speed and finality. Having been repealed in its entirety by Section 107(2) of the Arbitration Act 1996, the Act is no longer in force.|$|E
500|$|Feynman did {{not return}} to Cornell. Bacher, who had been {{instrumental}} in bringing Feynman to Cornell, had lured him to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). Part of the deal was that he could spend his first year on sabbatical in Brazil. He had become smitten by Mary Louise Bell from Neodesha, Kansas. They had met in a cafeteria in Cornell, where she had studied the history of Mexican art and textiles. She later followed him to Caltech, where he gave a lecture. While he was in Brazil, she had taught classes on the history of furniture and interiors at Michigan State University. He proposed to her by mail from Rio de Janeiro, and they married in Boise, Idaho, on June 28, 1952, shortly after he returned. They frequently quarreled and she was frightened by his violent temper. Their politics were different; although he registered and voted as a Republican, she was more conservative, and her opinion on the 1954 Oppenheimer security hearing ("Where there's smoke there's fire") offended him. They separated on May 20, 1956. An <b>interlocutory</b> decree of divorce was entered on June 19, 1956, on the grounds of [...] "extreme cruelty". The divorce became final on May 5, 1958.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Warner Bros. offered CAD$5,000 (later CAD$50,000) to the Canadian folk {{band the}} Wyrd Sisters {{for the rights}} to use their name in the film version of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Rowling had written a scene in the novel in which a band called the Weird Sisters {{appeared}} at a school dance, and the group owned the rights to the name in Canada. However, the offer was declined, and instead the band undertook a legal action against Warner Bros., as well as Jarvis Cocker of Pulp and Jonny Greenwood and Phil Selway of Radiohead, who were to play the band in the film. All plans to use the name in the movie were later abandoned. Despite that decision, the Canadian band filed a CAD$40-million ($39million) lawsuit against Warner in Ontario court. In connection with the lawsuit, the band brought an <b>interlocutory</b> injunction hoping to prevent the release of the film. The injunction application was dismissed. The entire suit was dismissed in November 2005. In June 2006, an Ontario judge decreed that the band pay Warner Bros. CAD$140,000 in legal costs, describing their lawsuit as [...] "highly intrusive". The group claimed they planned to appeal the decision. Jarvis Cocker initially wished to release an album of [...] "Weird Sisters"-themed music with collaborators including Franz Ferdinand, Jack White and Iggy Pop, but the project was dropped {{as a result of the}} lawsuit. The Wyrd Sisters reported death threats from irate Harry Potter fans. As of March 2010, the lawsuit has been settled out of court, the details sealed.|$|E
