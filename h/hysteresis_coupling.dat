40|$|We {{present a}} new concept of bearingless slice motor that levitates and rotates a {{ring-shaped}} solid rotor. The rotor is made of a semi-hard magnetic material exhibiting magnetic hysteresis, such as D 2 steel. The rotor is radially biased with a homopolar permanent-magnetic flux, on which the stator can superimpose two-pole flux to generate suspension forces. By regulating the suspension forces based on position feedback, the two radial rotor degrees of freedom are actively stabilized. The two tilting degrees of freedom and the axial translation are passively stable due to the reluctance forces from the bias flux. In addition, the stator can generate a torque by superimposing six-pole rotating flux, which drags the rotor via <b>hysteresis</b> <b>coupling.</b> This six-pole flux does not generate radial forces {{in conjunction with the}} homopolar flux or two-pole flux, and therefore the suspension force generation is in principle decoupled from the driving torque generation. We have developed a prototype system as a proof of concept. The stator has 12 teeth, each of which has a single-phase winding that is individually driven by a linear transconductance power amplifier. The system has four reflectivetype optical sensors to differentially measure the two radial degrees of freedom of the rotor. The suspension control loop is implemented such that the phase margin is 25 ° at the cross-over frequency of 110 Hz. The prototype system can levitate the rotor and drive it up to about 1730 r/min. The maximum driving torque is about 2. 7 mNm...|$|E

In these samples, the superconducting layer is divided into parallel stripes segregated by non-superconducting grooves. In order to facilitate the current sharing between the stripes and thus increase the reliability of the striated conductors, a sparse network of superconducting bridges is superimposed on the striated film.

The response is evaluated by an analysis of synchronized lens currents and estimated sharpness of the resulting images. The sensitivity of image sharpness versus input variation is obtained in a local operating point. The hysteresis effect and its coupling with dynamics, as a response to changes over the complete working range, result in a significant deviation in image sharpness. Since the magnetic field is not available for measurement, the error is expressed in the quasi-static input variation required to correct for it.

40|$|In {{this work}} the AC {{transport}} current losses, {{as well as}} the AC losses in external magnetic fields, in multifilamentary Bi(2223) tapes are investigated. For the measurements of the AC transport current losses a set-up was built to measure the losses in the frequency range from 10 Hz to 1000 Hz and for amplitudes from 50 mA to 50 A. The AC transport current losses show a linear frequency dependence due to hysteresis losses in the self field and no significant dependence on the twist length or the matrix material, as it was expected from the theory. Measurements at different 55 filament tapes with nearly the same critical current and filament geometry show different transport current losses which could be explained by different critical current densities in different shells of the filamentary region. The loss factors of tapes were found to not depend on the filament geometry, filament number, matrix material and the critical current. For tapes with only 7 filaments, or with only filaments in an outer ring, a small reduction of the loss factor was observed. This may be explained by a more homogeneous AC current distribution. AC loss measurements at untwisted tapes in external magnetic fields show a loss behaviour which could be described by the critical state model for coupled filaments. Twisted tapes could be described by the model of decoupled filaments, when measuring in parallel field direction. From the total losses the loss contributions from the <b>hysteresis</b> and <b>coupling</b> current losses were separated. The penetration fields are estimated from the hysteresis loss contribution. A comparison between these fields and calculated penetration fields gives significant differences which should be related to different critical current densities in the tapes.

We first explore the parameter spaces for various types of collective states using the phase plots of the two statistical quantities, namely the strength of incoherence and the discontinity measure. In the quasi-static limit of the changing of coupling range, we have observed how the system relaxes from one state to another and have identified a few interesting collective dynamical states along the way. Under a sinusoidal change of the coupling range, the global order parameter characterizing the degree of synchronization in the system is shown to undergo a <b>hysteresis</b> with the <b>coupling</b> range.

40|$|The {{piezoelectric}} tube actuator of Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) realizes rapid scanning in nano-scale. However, <b>hysteresis,</b> creep and <b>coupling</b> {{effect of}} piezoelectric tube actuator significantly limit {{the precision of}} AFM. In this paper, an adaptive sliding mode controller is proposed to minimize the tracking error due to the adverse effects. The piezoelectric tube actuator is characterized as a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) nonlinear time-varying system because of hysteresis and creep. The controller is designed based on the reduced order nonlinear finite element (FE) model. Hysteresis is divided into a linear part and a bounded time-varying unknown part to reduce the bound of the uncertainties. The latter part together with creep and electrode dislocation is considered as bounded uncertainty. The controller gains of the equivalent control part are estimated through adaptive laws. The sliding mode observer is designed based on Walcott Zak observer for estimating the unmeasurable states. Lyapunov criterion is stated to guarantee {{the stability of the}} closed loop system. The simulation of the piezoelectric tube actuator with the adaptive sliding mode controller is performed under scanning operation. The result shows that the tracking errors are bounded in small values. Finally, the performance of the adaptive sliding mode controller is compared with the output feedback controller and the proportional-integral (PI) controller which is commonly adopted in AFM.

Finally, we interpret measured ac losses in an MgB 2 wire cut into different lengths representing different equivalent twist pitches. Under certain circumstances short sample lengths are shown to give inaccurate measurement results. On the other hand, short sample lengths of non-twisted wires can be used to estimate the twist pitch necessary to electromagnetically decouple the superconducting filaments. For the studied MgB 2 wire, with a pure titanium matrix, the losses were mainly hysteretic, although the level of these losses was lowered when reducing the equivalent twist pitch, and thereby the coupling currents.

Ice sheet <b>hysteresis</b> is closely <b>coupled</b> with carbon-­‐cycle feedback mechanisms that are strongly affected by ocean circulation. However, the absence of high-­‐resolution records representing the North Atlantic end member, a key region driving modern climate variability and ocean circulation, hamper full understanding of Oligocene-­‐Miocene ocean circulation and climate. In this thesis, I integrate palaeomagnetic, X-­‐ray fluorescence (XRF), and environmental magnetic records to date and reconstruct current variability from contourite drift sediments, recovered at Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Site U 1406 (northwest Atlantic). The revised splice ensures stratigraphic continuity for the studied section. The presented novel palaeomagnetic data processing protocol, which is applicable to all weakly magnetised sediments, ensures the use of only high quality directional data {{for the construction of}} a reliable magnetostratigraphy between Chrons C 6 Ar – C 9 n (21 -­‐ 27 Ma). Astronomical tuning using XRF-­‐based ln(Ca/K), a proxy for CaCO 3 content, provides independent dates for the identified geomagnetic reversals. I determine the best age estimates of reversals using a set of criteria to reconcile the Oligocene-­‐Miocene geomagnetic polarity time scale. Congruent obliquity-­‐paced CaCO 3 cycles at Ocean Drilling Program Site 926 (equatorial Atlantic) and IODP Site U 1406 suggest that one corrosive bottom water mass influences the CaCO 3 content of the boreal Atlantic. The location and occurrence of contourite drift sediments at IODP Site U 1406 advocates that the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) is the candidate for such corrosive bottom waters. DWBC variability around the Oligocene-­‐Miocene Transition (~ 23 Ma) is traced using the detrital magnetic fraction, containing titanohaematite, recognised through detailed rock and environmental magnetic measurements. During the last ca. 1 Myr of the Oligocene, the decrease in CaCO 3 -­‐corrected concentration and coercivity of titanohaematite indicates an invigorated DWBC.
