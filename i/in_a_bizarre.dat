The Ferraris were still leading, but Massa was fastest, just 0.035 seconds ahead of Räikkönen.

5|$|Phoenix Wright, a newly-hired defense {{attorney}} at the Fey and Co. law firm, agrees to represent {{his best friend}} Larry Butz, who {{has been charged with}} the murder of his girlfriend, Cindy Stone. With the help of his boss and mentor, Mia Fey, he proves that Frank Sahwit, the prosecution's star witness, is the real murderer. Shortly thereafter, Mia is killed in her office, and her younger sister Maya is arrested after the police find her name on a note left by Mia. Phoenix takes her case, facing off against Miles Edgeworth, an equally-talented prosecutor. Phoenix manages to identify Redd White, a professional blackmailer, as the real killer, only to find himself charged with the killing instead. Representing himself, he exposes White in court and gets justice for Mia. His reputation established, Phoenix takes on another case, this time defending Will Powers, the lead actor in a children's TV show, against accusations that he killed his co-star, Jack Hammer. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>bizarre</b> twist, it is revealed that Dee Vasquez, the show's producer, committed the murder in self-defense after Hammer tried to kill her and frame Powers for her death.|$|E

25|$|From March 1943, British Intelligence {{had been}} trying to find Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's {{headquarters}} in France. Part of the brief looked at creating a timetable for Rommel, to assess how easy it would be to kill him.

25|$|He was {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bizarre</b> run-out with Shivnarine Chanderpaul {{in the third}} Test against New Zealand in 2006. Morton drove the ball to mid-on where Daniel Vettori was fielding {{and ran to the}} non striker end. Chanderpaul, at the other end, initially took a few steps down the wicket but then turned {{and went back to the}} non-striker's end. Morton believed he was out, and, furious at his captain, began to walk off. However, following a call to the third umpire, it was decided that Morton had grounded his bat at the non-striker's end just before Chanderpaul, and hence was safe and that Chanderpaul was out. Video evidence suggests that the umpire's decision was wrong: although Morton made his ground first, he then left it before the run-out was made, so he should have been the one dismissed.|$|E

At the Western & Southern Financial Group Women's Open in Cincinnati, she defeated Yanina Wickmayer and Caroline Wozniacki to reach the semifinal. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>bizarre</b> match, Dementieva the fell to Jelena Janković, 6–7(2), 6–0, 6–7(6), despite leading 6–2 in the final set tiebreak having already saved three match points herself prior. At the Rogers Cup in Toronto, Dementieva defeated Serena Williams 7–6(2), 6–1 to reach her fourth final of the year. In the final, she defeated an unseeded Maria Sharapova 6–4, 6–3 in the final to win her third title {{of the year and}} 14th of her career. As a result of her performances in these three tournaments, Dementieva secured the US Open Series crown.

Internet Service Providers (ISPs), in general, are immune from liability for information that originates with third parties (U.S. Communications Decency Act and the EU Directive 2000/31/EC). In Doe v. Cahill, the Delaware Supreme Court held that stringent standards had to be met to unmask the anonymous bloggers, and also took {{the unusual step of}} dismissing the libel case itself (as unfounded under American libel law) rather than referring it back to the trial court for reconsideration. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>bizarre</b> twist, the Cahills were able to obtain the identity of John Doe, {{who turned out to be}} the person they suspected: the town's mayor, Councilman Cahill's political rival. The Cahills amended their original complaint, and the mayor settled the case rather than going to trial.|$|E
25|$|Salme's Advanced Guard, {{which was}} posted near Sant' Imento {{north of the}} highway, was unchallenged most of the day. At about 2:30 pm, the {{divisions}} of Montrichard and Olivier crossed the Trebbia and marched to Salme's support. Seeing these French reinforcements in his front, Melas decided not to release Fröhlich's division. The Third Column commander sent Ott forward at 6:00 pm and the Austrians easily brushed aside Salme's outnumbered unit. Together, Ott and Fröhlich pushed Montrichard and Olivier back beyond the Trebbia by evening. That night <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bizarre</b> operation, Rosenberg took two Russian grenadier battalions across the Trebbia south of Gossolengo. They somehow penetrated the French lines as far as Settima where they routed a French detachment and liberated some prisoners. At 3:00 am, Rosenberg's expedition {{headed back to the}} west bank, again without arousing any French sentries. Four squadrons of the Karaczay Dragoons mounted a similar expedition but were detected and driven off by musketry. Both groups missed the pointless battle that occurred earlier in the evening. Hearing what they believed to be Moreau's artillery, three French battalions mounted an extemporaneous attack at 9:30 pm, surprising an Austrian battalion. Melas called up reinforcements from his own and Förster's divisions while Prince Liechtenstein charged into the fray with the Lobkowitz Dragoons. The artillery of both sides opened up on the melee, causing many friendly fire casualties. After strenuous efforts, the leaders of both sides managed to wind down the senseless fighting by 11:00 pm.|$|E
25|$|Starting 2000, Radcliffe won the Stormont Cross Country {{race for}} a third time. Radcliffe then {{finished}} fourth in Durham. Radcliffe then sustained a knee injury <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bizarre</b> way, as she was sidelined after kneeling on the floor writing thank you letters for wedding presents. For the European Cup, Radcliffe joined {{a host of other}} British athletes by pulled out injured. However, Radcliffe soon returned to the track {{for the first time since}} March after a virus, a knee operation and a calf muscle tear had kept her out; to race over 1,500metres in Barcelona. In her first race since the World Cross Country, Radcliffe finished 11th. At the London Grand Prix, Radcliffe finished second, one second outside of her British record, in only her second track race of the season. At the Weltklasse Zürich IAAF Golden League meeting Radcliffe competed in the 3,000metres and finished in fourth place. At the UK trials, Radcliffe wore long white socks after she twisted her ankle days before; and powered to the 5,000metres title. The British Grand Prix saw Radcliffe race over 3000metres, where once again she finished third. At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Radcliffe finished sixth in her 10,000metres heat to qualify for the final. In the final Radcliffe set a new British record, but crossed the line in fourth and was highly disappointed to miss out on a medal. Radcliffe returned to action by winning the BUPA Ireland five-mile race. At the Great North Run, Radcliffe ran a new European record for the half marathon, as she won the race in a time of 67 minutes and 7 seconds. Radcliffe was then selected for the 2000 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships in Mexico. Radcliffe won her first World title, despite suffering a panic attack when her nose tape, designed to help her breathe, fell off halfway round. The good run of form came to an end, when she turned her attention to the Cross Country events and finished third in Brussels. Radcliffe confirmed, that her last race of the year would be the Great North Cross Country. There Radcliffe defeated Tulu by seventy-five seconds, in eight inches of snow.|$|E
