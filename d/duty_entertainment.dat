50|$|The Maharashtra {{government}} imposed {{an additional}} 10 percent <b>entertainment</b> <b>duty</b> on movie tickets priced between Rs.251 and Rs.350 from January 16, 2013. However, tickets costing between Re.1 and Rs.250 will see no fresh levy. The government has also allowed theatre owners to collect Rs.11 as service charges on all tickets, up from Rs.6 now. The new tax slab is somewhat like this: If a multiplex or theatre owner charges up to Rs 250 per ticket, {{he will not}} have to pay any additional surcharge. If a ticket is priced between Rs 251 and Rs 350, the theatre or multiplex owner will be charged 10 per cent more; if a ticket is priced between Rs 351 and Rs 500, the owner will have to pay 15 per cent more, and if the ticket is priced more than Rs 501, the charge will be 20 per cent more. Mirror has learnt that theatre and multiplex owners will have to go for computerised booking system so that the number of tickets sold is on record. The Central Government's decision is effective from this month, and film and TV actors will be charged 12.36 per cent service tax on their earnings on programmes and endorsements.|$|R
