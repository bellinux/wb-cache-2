40|$|Many {{electric}} {{components in}} Québec in operation are in underground vaults {{in contact with}} free waters. These components (such as transformers, circuit breakers, <b>disconnecting</b> <b>switches,</b> etc.) are protected by paintings which {{make it possible to}} delay corrosion. However this mild steel part of these equipments is subject to delamination of painting with time. Nevertheless, the micro-defects initially present in painting, those which are induced {{at the time of the}} installation and, the scratches make that the material of these equipments can be in contact with free waters. This research project was developed by simulating the conditions which can be found in the underground vaults, i. e. in solutions containing bicarbonates, phosphates, sulfate and chlorides. Iron was selected as a material to study the effects of these ions on it. It will be useful as a reference material in a more exhaustive study carried out in the laboratory. In order to understand the electrochemical behavior of iron in these media, several electroanalytical methods were used like the cyclic voltamperometry, the chronoamperometry, the chronopotentiometry, the rotating disk electrode disc, etc. The electrochemical techniques were supplemented by measurements of scanning electron microscopy, the Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy, x-ray fluorescence, and inductively coupled plasma. The addition of the sulfate ions on the electrochemical behavior of iron electrodes in the presence of bicarbonate ions was examined. In solutions which contain only sulfate ions, iron shows a uniform corrosion. The addition of sulfate ions in the presence of bicarbonate ions cause pitting corrosion. At the time of the localized attack, there is formation of a passivating product of corrosion which covers the site. The various electrochemical behaviors were compared and explained by the analysis of the formation of the probable products and their physicochemical properties during electrochemical polarization. The electrochemical behavior of iron in aqueous solutions of phosphate ions was examined in the presence of chloride or of sulfate ions. It was shown that the phosphate ions behave like very effective inhibiting ions against a localized corrosion. In the presence of sulfates ions, there is a similarity with the phosphate ions in the active-passive dissolution region. The electrochemical behavior of iron electrode with respect to the localized attack induced by the presence of chloride and/or sulfate tons in aqueous bicarbonate solutions has been investigated by using full factorial design and pitting potential as an object function. It has been shown that both chloride and sulfate ions in the presence of bicarbonate ions are aggressive, but interactively with bicarbonate ions, chloride ions are aggressive and sulfate ions are inhibitive toward iron attack when these anions are present together in the solution. These observations had been linked to the presence of particular corrosion products (green rusts), and to their properties and reactions...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} the result of a {{bachelor}} degree thesis in the Industrial Design Engineering program at Lulea University of Technology. The thesis work has been implemented at Creator Teknisk Utveckling AB in Vikmanshyttan. The work has been a product development project about a smart temperature sensor that monitors the temperature of sensitive parts in high voltage substations. The purpose of the project has been to secure that the sensor will withstand environmental stresses and find a final design that makes the product more cost efficient to manufacture. The Swedish electricity grid can be divided into three different types of grids; Local grid, Regional grid and the National grid. These grids provides the customer with electricity from where it´s produced. Where these grids connect with each other, there are substations which can send the electricity with contained voltage or it can be transformed into a lower voltage. When service needs to be performed on the substations, for example maintenance work, the power must be cut off. That is done by a circuit breaker and a disconnecting switch. The breaker turns the power off and then the disconnector opens up to secure the safety of the service staff. These <b>disconnecting</b> <b>switches</b> are critical components, since attrition injuries can affect the components breakdown due to overheating. If Creator’s smart temperature sensor is used, the temperature can be monitored continuously and prevent costly power failures. The goal for this project was to make a prototype of the product with a design that protects the electronic parts from environmental stress without deteriorate the performance. The goal also included to get information of manufacturing costs for proper manufacturing methods to make 10 000 units. The project has followed a stage-gate model divided into four phases: project planning, context study, creative phase and detail development/concept. The project began with a structured project plan and an estimated time-schedule. Then the product was studied, as well as the high voltage environment where the product will be used. During the creative part of the project a workshop was held that, among other creative methods, generated a lot of different ideas. The result of these ideas generated three concepts that went through a concept selection. Trough that selection, one concept was chosen and further developed into two new concepts. Manufactures was contacted to get approximate manufacturing costs. The two concept was named Nigrum and Argentum. In the final selection, Nigrum was chosen as the final concept. Manufactures was contacted again to get more precise prices and manufacturing methods. The final concept Nigrum has a selling design that is adapted for manufacturing. The report also includes a theoretical framework of topics that have been important for the project. Validerat; 20160704 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E

While the switch is turned on, the key is held by the interlock attached to the <b>disconnecting</b> <b>switch.</b> To open the kiln door, the switch is first opened, which releases the key.

40|$|Voltage {{transients}} {{generated in}} GIS by {{the operation of}} circuit breakers or <b>disconnect</b> <b>switches</b> induce high voltages across interruptions of the enclosure. In this paper we discuss such interruptions and their necessity. We present fast measurements of voltage and current at the GIS/cable-interface of a 150 kV substation, where the enclosure is interrupted to permit current measurement. Circuit breaker operation causes a single voltage transient across the interruption with an amplitude up to 40 kV, a duration of 200 - 300 ns, and a risetime of about 5 ns. <b>Disconnect</b> <b>switch</b> operation causes multiple transients. each having a smaller amplitude and a longer risetime. The voltage across enclosure interruptions is adequately suppressed, and breakdown is completely eliminated, when the interruption is bridged with resistors.

40|$|Recently, {{there have}} been many {{initiatives}} to incorporate advanced controls, two way communications, digital technologies and advanced power system components in the operation and control of power distribution systems. These initiatives are aiming to realize what becomes known as the “Smart grid”. It is expected that a Smart Grid will lead to enhancement in the reliability and efficiency of the power system. The movement towards the Smart Grid is motivated by many factors; the need to integrate more renewable power to mitigate the global warming, the increasing interest in connecting more distributed generation (DG) as a way to postpone large investment in transmission and bulk generation, and the need to increase the reliability of the power system overall to minimize disturbance costs. It is the overall goal of this research to introduce novel distribution system operation techniques to assist in the effort of realizing the “Smart Distribution System” in both normal and system restoration modes. In particular, three main operation functions are dealt with in this research work; Voltage Control, Reactive Power Control and Distribution System Restoration. First for Voltage Control, a reliable and efficient method is proposed to control voltage regulators in order to enable the regulation of multiple feeders with diversified loads using only one regulator provided that no DG is connected to the feeders. Regulator’s tap is selected based on the solution of an integer linear optimization problem. The method has a closed form solution for the optimal tap; that is valuable for real time operation. In addition, necessary condition for feasible solutions is examined. Next, a novel coordinated voltage control scheme is proposed to enable the voltage regulator to efficiently regulate the voltage of multiple feeders in the presence of DGs. The proposed technique is based on placing a Remote Terminal Unit (RTUs) at each DG and each line capacitor. These RTUs coordinate together, through communication, and form a multi-agent system. An important contribution of this research is that the proposed scheme provides the minimum hardware requirement to efficiently estimate the voltage profile of a feeder with DGs. The proposed scheme enables the integration of more DGs into the system by, efficiently, coordinating the operation of voltage regulators and DGs to mitigate voltage rise problem caused by the connection of DGs to the system. Second, for Reactive Power Control, a decentralized reactive power control scheme is proposed to optimally control switched shunt capacitors of the system in order to minimize system losses and maintain acceptable voltage profile. The proposed algorithm provides capacitors with “Advanced Voltage Sensing” capability to enable capacitors to switch in and out according to the global minimum and maximum voltage of the feeder. The proposed technique utilizes the same RTU used for voltage control and relies on the voltage profile estimation technique proposed in this research for the coordinated voltage control. In addition, novel decentralized algorithm is proposed to estimate the feeder voltage profile change as a result of injecting reactive power at the capacitor bus. The proposed reactive power control scheme can be used to coordinate the operation of any number of capacitors connected to the distribution system. Combining voltage control and reactive power control schemes, generalized coordinated voltage control is proposed to coordinate between DGs, shunt capacitors and voltage regulators in order to achieve optimal voltage control for the distribution system and solve the steady state voltage rise problem caused by the connection of DGs, hence, allowing more DGs to be connected to the system. Over and above, the proposed generalized coordinated voltage control enables the realization of a new operation-time DG connection impact assessment concept. Based on this concept, the system will carry out a real-time assessment and decide, based on the available control actions, the maximum DG power that can be allowed to connect to the system at particular operating conditions. This new concept will allow great flexibility to the connection of DGs, most notably, when, due to a change in system configuration, the DG is needed to be connected to a feeder other than the one it was planned for during the planning stage. The last operation function dealt with in this research work is the distribution system restoration. Novel decentralized distribution system restoration scheme is proposed. The proposed scheme is based on dividing the distribution system into zones based on the availability of <b>disconnecting</b> <b>switches.</b> Each zone is controlled by an Agent. The restoration is done based on the coordination between these Agents. Proposed communication protocols between Agents are discussed in details. The goal of the proposed restoration scheme is to maximize the restored power while preserving the radial structure of the distribution system and without exceeding the thermal limit of any equipment in the system. As the proposed technique does not assume any supervision from any central point, this technique will enable the realization of a self-healing distribution system restoration...|$|E
