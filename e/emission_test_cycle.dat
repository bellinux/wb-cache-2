50|$|An <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> <b>cycle</b> is a {{protocol}} contained in an emission standard to allow repeatable and comparable measurement of exhaust emissions for different engines or vehicles. Test cycles specify the specific {{conditions under which}} the engine or vehicle is operated during the emission test. There are many different test cycles issued by various national and international governments and working groups. Specified parameters in a test cycle include a range of operating temperature, speed, and load. Ideally these are specified so as to accurately and realistically represent the range of conditions under which the vehicle or engine will be operated in actual use. Because it is impractical to test an engine or vehicle under every possible combination of speed, load, and temperature, this may not actually be the case. Vehicle and engine manufacturers may exploit {{the limited number of}} test conditions in the cycle by programming their engine management systems to control emissions to regulated levels at the specific test points contained in the cycle, but create a great deal more pollution under conditions experienced in real operation but not represented in the test cycle. This results in real emissions higher than the standards are supposed to allow, undermining the standards and public health.|$|E

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} of electric vehicles (EVs) and the representativeness of different driving cycles are important aspects to address EVs real-world driving conditions performance. This paper {{presents the results}} of an explorative test campaign to investigate the impact of different driving cycles on the energy consumption of an electric vehicle available on the market. The vehicle is a battery electric city-car which has been tested over the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), the current version of the World-wide harmonized Light vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC) and the World-wide Motorcycle <b>emission</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Cycle</b> (WMTC). The tests are performed at different ambient temperatures (namely + 23 ºC and - 7 ºC) with and without the use of the Heating Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) system (in cooling and heating mode, respectively). The NEDC test was chosen being the driving cycle prescribed by the legislative type-approval procedure, while the WMTC and WLTC were chosen to investigate the energy demand of substantially different driving cycles, characterized by higher dynamicity and a longer high speed phase. To further investigate the impact of the HVAC system on the energy consumption also some preliminary tests on the Mobile Air Conditioning (MAC) test procedure are presented. The results of these tests are compared with the fuel consumption and gaseous emissions results of one hybrid vehicle, and three conventional fuel passenger cars (all Euro 5 a certified vehicles, tested on the NEDC cycle). The results constitute the basis for future technical analysis and considerations to determine the representativeness of legislative test-procedures. JRC. F. 8 -Sustainable Transpor...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen {{remains an}} {{attractive}} alternative fuel to petroleum {{and a number}} of investigators claim that adding hydrogen to the air intake manifold of a diesel engine will reduce criteria emissions and diesel fuel consumption. Such claims are appealing when trying to simultaneously reduce petroleum consumption, greenhouse gases and criteria pollutants. The goal of this research was to measure the change in criteria emissions (CO, NO x, and PM 2. 5) and greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO 2), using standard test methods {{for a wide range of}} hydrogen addition rates. A two-stroke Detroit Diesel Corporation 12 V- 71 TI marine diesel engine was mounted on an engine dynamometer and tested at three out of the four loads specified in the ISO 8178 - 4 E 3 <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> <b>cycle</b> and at idle. The engine operated on CARB ultra-low sulfur # 2 diesel with hydrogen added at flow rates of 0, 22 and 220 SLPM. As compared with the base case without hydrogen, measurements showed that hydrogen injection at 22 and 220 SLPM had negligible influence on the overall carbon dioxide specific emission, EFCO 2. However, in examining data at each load the data revealed that at idle EFCO 2 was reduced by 21 % at 22 SLPM (6. 9 % of the added fuel energy was from hydrogen) and 37. 3 % at 220 SLPM (103. 1 % of the added fuel energy was from hydrogen). At all other loads, the influence of added hydrogen was insignificant. Specific emissions for nitrogen ox ides, EFNO x, and fine particulate matters, EFPM 2. 5, showed a trade-off relationship at idle. At idle, EFNO x was reduced by 28 % and 41 % with increasing hydrogen flow rates, whilst EFPM 2. 5 increased by 41 % and 86 % respectively. For other engine loads, EFNO x and EFPM 2. 5 did not change significantly with varying hydrogen flow rates. One of the main reasons for the greater impact of hydrogen at idle is that the contribution of hydrogen to the total fuel energy is much higher at idle as compared to the other loads. The final examination in this paper was the system energy balance when hydrogen is produced by an on-board electrolysis unit. An analysis at 75 % engine load showed that hydrogen production increased the overall equivalent fuel consumption by 2. 6 % at 22 SLPM and 17. 7 % at 220 SLPM. © 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The proportion of brake wear debris emitted as airborne brake wear particles was 2 – 21 % of the mass of wear. Oxygenated carbonaceous components were included in the airborne PM but not in the original friction material, which indicates that changes in carbon composition occurred during the abrasion process.

In {{order to improve}} the thermal management in DOCs, active flow control strategies have been introduced for several years.

In this thesis, a series of modulated dynamic models were developed using SimulinkRTM {{to better understand the}} heat transfer mechanisms of a catalyst. The simulation results were validated by the reference experimental data collected in the Clean Diesel Engine Laboratory (CDL) at the University of Windsor. The potential of the active flow control in DOCs was demonstrated, because a better thermal management realized by active flow scheme leads to more energy efficient diesel after-treatment.

50|$|In most cases, {{motoring}} dynamometers are symmetrical; a 300 kW AC dynamometer {{can absorb}} 300 kW {{as well as}} motor at 300 kW. This is an uncommon requirement in engine testing and development. Sometimes, a more cost-effective solution is to attach a larger absorption dynamometer with a smaller motoring dynamometer. Alternatively, a larger absorption dynamometer and a simple AC or DC motor {{may be used in}} a similar manner, with the electric motor only providing motoring power when required (and no absorption). The (cheaper) absorption dynamometer is sized for the maximum required absorption, whereas the motoring dynamometer is sized for motoring. A typical size ratio for common <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> <b>cycles</b> and most engine development is approximately 3:1. Torque measurement is somewhat complicated since there are two machines in tandem - an inline torque transducer is the preferred method of torque measurement in this case. An eddy-current or waterbrake dynamometer, with electronic control combined with a variable frequency drive and AC induction motor, is a commonly used configuration of this type. Disadvantages include requiring a second set of test cell services (electrical power and cooling), and a slightly more complicated control system. Attention must be paid to the transition between motoring and braking in terms of control stability.|$|R

40|$|The key {{driving forces}} in engine {{development}} are fuel efficiency and emission levels. These aspects are particularly poignant under vehicle idling or low crawling motions in typical city driving.
