Bulge heights and internal pressures are measured during bulge testing. Tube thicknesses at vertex of a bulge shape are measured by a dial <b>caliper</b> <b>gauge.</b> Bulge curvatures and contact points are measured by taking digital photos of bulge shapes combined with measurement methods in CAD software. Effective stress- strain relationships are obtained from the newly developed analytical model using those measured values. Flow stress curves obtained from the effective stress – strain relationships are compared with those by other researchers and tensile test. Finite element analysis methods are used to conduct simulation of tube hydroforming using the flow stress curves. Predicted internal pressures versus bulge heights and tube thicknesses are compared with experimental results. Verification of the developed analytical model is presented.

This thesis details incremental improvements {{in the design and}} operation of an existing vibrating-wire viscometer-densimeter (VWVD). These improvements were necessary in order to allow safe investigations of viscosity of highly flammable mixtures such as methane + n-hexadecane. The procedure for absolute viscosity measurement using the VWVD is described in detail. In the absolute mode of operation, the properties of the vibrating-wire (i. e. radius and length) and that of the suspended sinker (i. e. mass and volume) were determined via independent mechanical measurements. The diameter (and hence the radius) of a cetreless-ground tungsten wire was measured accurately using a laser micrometer whereas the length of the wire was carefully measured with an <b>internal</b> <b>caliper.</b> The mass and volume of the suspended sinker were determined via hydrodynamic weighing methods.

40|$|For the {{nondestructive}} evaluation of components with ultrasound a priori {{information about the}} specimen is necessary. So the time of flight to a defect is measured and, with known sound velocity, {{it is possible to}} determine the correct location of the defect. In general, the sound velocity is assumed as known. If it is not known, the sound velocity has to be determined additionally. This can be done, for example, by measuring the time of flight to the backwall with ultrasound and the thickness of the specimen with a <b>caliper</b> <b>gauge.</b> However, this is impossible to realize with single-sided access to the specimen. For determining the size of inclusions, several techniques like the half-value method or the DGS-method (Distance Gain Size) are established. These methods are based on the assumption of (circular) plane reflectors. Therefore, they cannot be applied on the size determination of inclusions with curved surfaces. This contribution presents new methods for the localization and characterization of inclusions in media with unknown acoustic properties by means of annular arrays. The usage of annular arrays allows the variation of the focus position. By evaluating the signal amplitude {{as a function of the}} focus position and the measured time of flight, sound velocity and distance to the reflector can be determined simultaneously [1]. For classifying the inclusions, the directional pattern of the reflected sound field is evaluated. The sound pressure distribution of the reflected sound field at the probe surface mainly depends on the shape of the reflector. Evaluating the amplitude difference between two annular elements allows to classify the reflector shape [2]. These methods are demonstrated on a test specimen with in epoxy resin embedded spheres and circular disc-shaped reflectors with diameters between one and seven wavelengths. The sound velocity of the epoxy resin can be determined with the simultaneous method reaching an accuracy higher than 97 %. The amplitude difference method allows to distinguish between spheres and circular disc-shaped reflectors. The same method also enables a non-scanning determination of the size of the circular disc-shaped reflectors, even for dimensions smaller than the width of the sound beam. For the size determination of the spheres, several methods are presented and discussed...|$|R

Cardisoma guanhumi and Ucides cordatus are two land crabs that are exploited at a high scale and also in an artisan way in the Caribbean area and in the coasts of Brazil, which populations are endangered due to uncontrolled exploitation. The purpose of this work is to provide various methods to estimate indirectly crab body size. Sampling {{was carried out in}} Carenero (C. guanhumi) and Cumaná (U. cordatus) (Venezuela). For each species, three methods were used to measure burrow diameter (Vernier, <b>internal</b> spring <b>caliper</b> and photograph), and these were correlated with real body size of the crabs. Model II linear regression analyzes, i. e. Ordinary Least Squares and Mayor Axis, were used to build and test the performance of forecasting models. Cardisoma guanhumi showed a high bivariate data dispersion using Vernier and photo measuring methods, increasing these towards larger animals. Less dispersion was achieved with the spring caliper method; this resulted in the most accurate measurements of indirectly estimated body size in C. guanhumi (r²= 0. 61), whereas Vernier measurements were the least precise. On the other hand, all three methods gave reliable estimates for U. cordatus, being the Vernier method the most accurate (r²= 0. 71). However, in both species, all forecasting equations overestimated the size of smaller crabs (those below the mean) but underestimated the size of larger crabs. Nevertheless, all three methods were statistically significant for each of the species, and looking at the above mentioned underand overestimations, they can serve as {{reliable and}} fast non-destructive tools to be used by resource managers and field biologists to acquire size structure information concerning these two species.

The measured value of the bark thickness depends on measuring method. To analyse the possible bark thickness differences of spruce, given by different measuring methods and Peintinger´s bark thickness tables and to calculate the corresponding round wood volume differences, given by different bark thickness deduction compared with the Czech Standard is the principle goal of presented research. Three ways of bark thickness measuring were realized: by using bark gauge, increment hammer and slide <b>caliper.</b> Bark <b>gauge</b> gives the highest bark thickness values – 2, 2 mm higher compared with our standard, corresponding volume decrease is 3, 4 %.

Slide caliper give the values 0, 9 mm higher compared with our standard, corresponding volume decrease is 1, 5 %. Slide caliper partly damages the surface layer of the bark. Increment hammer gives 0, 1 mm higher values of the bark thickness compared with our standard thanks to the destruction of the surface bark layer. Corresponding volume decrease can be approx. 0, 1 %. Peintinger’s bark thickness tables give 1, 3 mm higher spruce bark thickness, it means to 1, 9 % lower round wood volume. It means, Peintingers tables correspond better with the measured values than with the Czech Standard. We can recommend the using of Peintinger’s table for deduction of spruce bark thickness in electronic measuring of the round wood over bark and to use the bark gauge for test measuring. Both two methods gave the closest results to real values while our tests and it is very simple to use this instrument...|$|R

The two treatments compared were: chemical thinning (NAA 12 ppm + 6 -BA 120 ppm, at 14 DAFB) and artificial shading (with a polypropylene 90 % shading cloth, at 30 DAFB, for one week). Fruit drop, fruit growth rate via <b>caliper</b> and electronic <b>gauges,</b> and whole tree gas exchange were measured before, during and after shading. Fruit daily growth patterns changed and greatly reduced under shading, as well as net carbon exchange rates, total and per unit of light intercepted by the trees, decreased more than 50 % during shading. This work supports the hypothesis that C-deficit may induce fruit abscission around 30 DAFB. The effects of chemical thinning and shading on fruit abscission (58, 4 ± 1, 98 and 56, 3 ± 2, 42 %), crop load (4, 17 ± 0, 44 and 4, 14 ± 0, 27 fruitscm- 2 TCSA), yield density (0, 58 ± 0, 06 and 0, 60 ± 0, 03 Kgcm- 2 TCSA), final fruit weight and size (164, 89 ± 1, 97 and 165, 37 ± 1, 39 g, 73, 01 ± 0, 26 and 72, 33 ± 0, 23 mm), were the same. Fruits quality was superior in shading, with higher sugar content, flesh firmness and titrable acidity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. High jugular bulb {{represents}} {{very important}} variation in neurosurgery. The aim {{of our research}} was to measure certain characteristics of jugular foramen and surrounding bony structures in order to evaluate their possible significance in high jugular bulb detection. Thirty seven dried human skull sagittal sections were used as material. Sigmoid sinus groove width and depth, jugular fossa height and exocranial opening mean diameter were measured with vernier <b>caliper.</b> <b>Internal</b> auditory canal height and the distance between its inferior margin and superior margin of petrous bone, jugular foramen endocranial opening area and sino dural angle were measured with ImageJ. Cluster analysis with jugular fossa height as classification parameter {{was used for the}} classification of the analyzed skull sagittal sections. Classification analysis showed the presence of two groups: the first with predominantly low height of jugular fossa dome, the second with significantly higher values of jugular fossa dome, sino-dural angle and mean diameter of jugular fossa exocranial opening. This group predominantly included right skull sagittal sections. In addition, sigmoid sinus groove width and depth, jugular foramen endocranial opening area and jugular fossa exocranial opening mean diameter were significantly higher on the right in relation to the left side. So, it can be concluded that high jugular fossa dome is more frequently associated with sigmoid sinus groove anterior position, high values of mean diameter of jugular fossa exocranial opening and sigmoid sinus groove width and depth, especially on the right side. Key words: Jugular fossa, high bulb of jugular vein, groove for sigmoid sinus, morphometr...|$|R
