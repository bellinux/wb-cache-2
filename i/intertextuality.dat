5|$|Just as machinima can be {{the cause}} of legal dispute in {{copyright}} ownership and illegal use, it makes heavy use of <b>intertextuality</b> and raises the question of authorship. Machinima takes copyrighted property (such as characters in a game engine) and repurposes it to tell a story, but another common practice in machinima-making is to retell an existing story from a different medium in that engine.|$|E
5|$|Another {{way that}} machinima {{demonstrates}} <b>intertextuality</b> {{is in its}} tendency to make frequent references to texts, works, and other media just like TV ads or humorous cartoons such as The Simpsons might do. For example, the machinima series Freeman's Mind, created by Ross Scott, is filmed by taking a recording of Scott playing through the game Half Life as a player normally would and combining it with a voiceover (also recorded by Scott) to emulate an inner monologue of the normally voiceless protagonist Gordon Freeman. Scott portrays Freeman as a snarky, sociopathic character who makes frequent references to works and texts including science fiction, horror films, action movies, American history, and renowned novels such as Moby Dick. These references to works outside the game, often triggered by events within the game, are prime examples of the densely intertextual nature of machinima.|$|E

25|$|The {{recipient}} of several national awards for literature, he received critical attention for plays, {{short stories and}} novels which merge <b>intertextuality</b> and parody with neorealistic elements. In his work for the Romanian stage, Gârbea has primarily reworked motifs from Anton Chekhov, Ion Luca Caragiale, Gustave Flaubert, Costache Negruzzi and various other of his predecessors, addressing contemporary realities.

25|$|In the 1960s and 1970s {{so-called}} post-structuralist and postmodernist theory, {{drawing upon}} structuralism and phenomenology {{as much as}} classical social science, made a considerable impact on frames of sociological enquiry. Often understood simply as a cultural style 'after-Modernism' marked by <b>intertextuality,</b> pastiche and irony, sociological analyses of postmodernity have presented a distinct era relating to (1) the dissolution of metanarratives (particularly {{in the work of}} Lyotard), and (2) commodity fetishism and the 'mirroring' of identity with consumption in late capitalist society (Debord; Baudrillard; Jameson). Postmodernism has also been associated with the rejection of enlightenment conceptions of the human subject by thinkers such as Michel Foucault, Claude Lévi-Strauss and, to a lesser extent, in Louis Althusser's attempt to reconcile Marxism with anti-humanism. Most theorists associated with the movement actively refused the label, preferring to accept postmodernity as a historical phenomenon rather than a method of analysis, if at all. Nevertheless, self-consciously postmodern pieces continue to emerge within the social and political sciences in general.|$|E

Unlike the collage-like, so-called polystylistic compositions of the late 1960 s, which also used quotation, an altogether different and more deeply embedded form has developed since then, where the quoted material is integrated to a much greater extent on the surface, only to lay bare its â��differenceâ�� at a deeper level.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{bachelor}} project, called ‘“Det skal arbejdes væk” - en kritisk diskursanalyse af tre håndværkeres fortælling om sundhed’, is to investigate our respondents expressed health narratives. The purpose is {{to understand what the}} content of these narratives are, and how the narratives among the respondents can relate to each other and the surrounding society. It is important in the perspective of communication to gain as much information about the target group as possible. It is essential to understand which discourses and understandings of the world that are ruling among the target group. In this context the surrounding society, the government, institutions, and the media are important elements to be aware of, because they may have an influence on how the target group interpret a communication product. This will be of great value in the process of planning strategic communication products – including health campaigns. In this project, we have chosen to use qualitative methods - an interview with three vocationally educated men. The expressed narratives are the starting point for the critical discourse analysis. We have used Norman Fairclough’s critical discourse analysis, and Michel Foucault’s theory concerning the mechanism of power to examine unequal relations between social groups in the society. By using Fairclough’s three-dimensional model we investigate hegemonies between the respondents and the society, and how to understand the relation between these two, with an analytic perspective on the respondents’ choice of words and their production and interpretation of communication texts and the society’s influence. The study concludes {{on the basis of the}} examined thesis, that the narratives about health and the ruling discourse about workmen are based on <b>intertextualities.</b> This concerns the way the respondents perceive and identify themselves in these <b>intertextualities.</b> Another analytic point is that the ‘right way of understanding health’ is, according to the respondents, defined by for instance the government, institutions and the media. This leads to a discussion, regarding Foucault’s power theory, and the unequal relationship between the government and the citizens. In addition to this analytical point the project deals with our respondents’ understandings of themselves and their health, when they are exposed for a certain chosen ‘workmen discourse’ in health campaigns...|$|R

Patrick McAleer, author of Inside the Dark Tower Series: Art, Evil and <b>Intertextuality</b> in the Stephen King Novels, argues that Flagg's situation is the most sympathetic of all of King's characters, and his evil may be retribution: [...] "n suspending any disbelief in the possibility that reprisal is a reaction to rape, the life of Flagg becomes one that looks to strike a balance for the sexual crime committed against him. And although Flagg's possible search for justice and balance is that which becomes imbalanced and even prejudiced, the mitigating factor here is that Flagg is not an originator of evil - he is just caught up in its web as another wronged individual seeking justice". McAleer compares Flagg to Satan in Paradise Lost, suggesting that he may be another [...] "fallen angel who has a valid case supporting his devilry". While agreeing that Flagg can be seen [...] "relishing in evil deeds at almost every juncture", he contends that no judgement can be made without the full story and context for his actions.|$|E
500|$|This re-appropriation of {{established}} texts, resources, and artistic properties {{to tell a}} story or make a statement {{is an example of a}} semiotic phenomenon known as <b>intertextuality</b> or resemiosis. [...] A more common term for this phenomenon is “parody”, but not all of these intertextual productions are intended for humor or satire, as demonstrated by the Few Good G-Men video. Furthermore, the argument of how well-protected machinima is under the guise of parody or satire is still highly debated; a piece of machinima may be reliant upon a protected property, but may not necessarily be making a statement about that property. Therefore, it is more accurate to refer to it simply as resemiosis, because it takes an artistic work and presents it in a new way, form, or medium. This resemiosis can be manifested in a number of ways. The machinima-maker can be considered an author who restructures the story and/or the world that the chosen game engine is built around. In the popular web series Red vs. Blue, most of the storyline takes place within the game engine of [...] and its subsequent sequels. [...] has an extensive storyline already, but Red vs. Blue only ever makes mention of this storyline once in the first episode. [...] Even after over 200 episodes of the show being broadcast onto the Internet since 2003, the only real similarities that can be drawn between Red vs. Blue and the game-world it takes place in are the character models, props, vehicles, and settings. Yet Burnie Burns and the machinima team at Rooster Teeth created an extensive storyline of their own using these game resources.|$|E

Therein, Bronfen proposes a reading method {{of the same name}} that is based on mapping and comparing formal aspects of cultural texts such as character constellations or political themes. According to Bronfen, this method allows for new insights into both the earlier and the later text. Rolf Löchel calls crossmapping a comparative method that not only uncovers <b>intertextualities</b> but also carves out similar concerns of texts from different media such as literature, cinema, television and painting. Amongst others, Bronfen crossmaps Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s novella The Yellow Wallpaper with the photographic oeuvre of Francesca Woodman, pop art with Baz Luhrmann’s Shakespeare adaption Romeo + Juliet, as well as Shakespeare’s Henriad with David Simon’s The Wire. In her teaching, Elisabeth Bronfen has further crossmapped Macbeth with Beau Willimon’s House of Cards and traced the rewritings of A Midsummer Night’s Dream in Hollywood from Max Reinhardt’s 1935 adaption via George Cukor’s The Philadelphia Story and Howard Hawks’ The Big Sleep to Susan Seidelman’s Desperately Seeking Susan.|$|R

40|$|This essay {{discusses}} {{the practices of}} journalistic illustration in nineteenth-century weekly illustrated magazines in London: magazines such as the 'Illustrated London News 'and the 'Graphic'. It focuses on the way that Géricault’s schema for representing shipwreck survivors in rafts and boats, mostly in the processes of rescue, was a resource for journalistic illustration in London. It concentrates on the period after 1880, ending {{with a discussion of}} the presence of ‘The Raft’ in reports of the 'Titanic'’s sinking. The essay considers some {{of the ways in which}} Géricault’s schema may have been a resource in the mythopoetic response to the 'Titanic' disaster.   The essay {{discusses the}} persistence of hand-made illustrations in the period of the ‘domestication’ of the half-tone screen (from the 1890 s onwards), which introduced the photographic image (as distinct from hand-drawn or wood-engraved images derived from photographs) into magazine illustration. In doing this it engages with the ways in which the coexistence of (half-tone accounts of) hand-made pictures and of (half-tone accounts of) photographs in the pages of magazines of the 'ILN' genre destabilized the truth-effects of hand-made illustration and threw the relative lack of affective power of the reportorial photograph into relief. It also discusses the implications for journalistic illustration of the difference between the telegram-speed ‘global-village-ization’ of the news community in the last quarter of the nineteenth century and the ‘snail-mail’ speed of transoceanic communication of pictures, until after the end of the First World War.   The essay aligns the picture-making logic of journalistic illustration with that of easel painting, to think about both these visual-culture-production milieux in terms of the manipulation of inherited visual resources, on the one hand in the praxis of picture-making, and on the other in pursuit of visible <b>intertextualities</b> so as to make ‘publics’ and to gratify contemporary interpretative communities. To do this the essay looks briefly at some possible sources for Géricault’s pictorial solutions to his representational tasks, both narrative and political, and considers some occurrences of the ‘Medusa’ compositional schema and iconography in the middle decades of the nineteenth century, from the UK and elsewhere, in broadsheet imagery and in magazines and newspapers. It then identifies some of the ways in which journalistic illustrators of the end of the 'Titanic' used Géricault’s schema as a way at once of fabricating and of adding resonance to their supposedly reportorial pictures.   The essay shows how ‘authorship’ of magazine illustration was collective and distributed, complicating the interpretation of visible <b>intertextualities.</b> This discussion of issues of interpretation will use the distinction between ‘publics’ and ‘audiences’, and consider the interpretative communities of reader-viewers of magazines of the 'ILN' genre in the period 'c'. 1880 to 'c'. 1912 in relation to the interpretative and theoretical resources of the twenty-first-century art historian...|$|R
