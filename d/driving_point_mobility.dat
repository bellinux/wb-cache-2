40|$|To {{facilitate}} {{tyre-road noise}} prediction, a computationally efficient high frequency tyre model is needed. Such models {{are always a}} compromise between the desired accuracy {{and the need for}} simplicity. In addition the accuracy of models is often limited by the quality of the input data available. For passenger car or truck tyres, a complete set of input data can be obtained only from the tyre manufacturer. However, this may not always be possible and one has to rely instead on approximate material data obtained from the careful study of experiments conducted on tyres. Although much research is available for passenger car tyres, less attention is paid to truck tyres. The work described in this thesis has the goal to close this gap by an experimental investigation of the vibrational behaviour of a truck tyre exposed to external forces. <b>Driving</b> <b>point</b> <b>mobility</b> and transfer mobility measurements are made to understand the behaviour of truck tyres, to gain insight into what may be the most suitable way to model truck tyres, and to extract material data for this modelling. A methodology was developed, which allows for the calculation of key tyre parameters, such as total bending stiffness and YoungÂ’s modulus from <b>driving</b> <b>point</b> <b>mobility.</b> These parameters are used in a 3 -D orthotropic double-plate model based on elastic field equations as developed for passenger tyres. A WFEM model is also used to understand the limitations of modelling a tyre as a structure with homogenous geometry (i. e. thickness and material properties identical over the whole cross section). Results from the 3 -D orthotropic double plate model are compared with measured tyre response functions. One can conclude from these results that the data obtained from measurements, as well as the model, can successfully be used later for simulation of contact forces in the tyre-road noise prediction models. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of piston's secondary motion (lateral and rotational motion) across {{the clearance between}} piston and cylinder inner wall of reciprocating machines are analyzed. This paper presents an analytical model, which can predict the impact forces and vibratory response of engine block surface induced by the piston slap of an internal combustion engine. A piston is modelled on a three-degree-of-freedom system to represent its planar motion. When slap occurs, the impact point between piston skirt and cylinder inner wall is modelled on a two-degree-of-freedom vibratory system. The equivalent parameters such as mass, spring constant, and damping constant of piston and cylinder inner wall are estimated by using measured (<b>driving)</b> <b>point</b> <b>mobility.</b> Those parameters are {{used to calculate the}} impact force and for estimating the vibration level of engine block surfaces. The predicted results are compared with experimental results to verify the model...|$|E
40|$|Rotary {{drilling}} with roller {{cone bit}} is {{often accompanied by}} wide fluctuations of the weight on bit (WOB). In certain cases the WOB periodically reduces to null. It has been postulated that in these cases the bit lifts off from the formation surface. The present study models the interaction among the lift-off of the bit, the WOB variation, and the modulation of the amplitude of the lobes on the formation surface. The analytical model is used to obtain numerical results for a specific drillstring. From these results it is inferred that the rotary speeds corresponding to the axial resonant frequencies of the system, determined from {{the functions of the}} <b>driving</b> <b>point</b> <b>mobility</b> and impedance at the bit, are critical regarding the wide fluctuations of the WOB. They may be associated with the sustenance of the lobes with large amplitude...|$|E
40|$|When {{calculating the}} {{vibration}} or sound {{power of a}} vibration source, {{it is necessary to}} know the <b>point</b> <b>mobility</b> of the supporting structure. A new method is presented for the calculation of <b>point</b> <b>mobility</b> matrix of a thin circular plate with concentrated masses in this paper. Transverse vibration mode functions are worked out by utilizing the structural circumferential periodicity of the inertia excitation produced by the concentrated masses. The numerical vibratory results, taking the clamped case as an instance, are compared to the published ones to validate the method for ensuring the correctness of <b>mobility</b> solution. <b>Point</b> <b>mobility</b> matrix, including the <b>driving</b> and transfer <b>point</b> <b>mobility,</b> of the titled structure is computed based on the transverse vibration solution.

40|$|For the {{modelling}} of {{the dynamic}} behaviour of tyres material data are required. Depending {{on the character of}} the model these will have different quality. Modelling with global structures such as beams or plates, representative data for the global bending stiffness, global mass etc. are needed. These data do not represent the details of the tyre structure but the combined properties of the structure. Therefore {{it is not possible to}} cut out samples of the tyre and determine the global material properties by measurements on these samples. Consequently it is necessary to estimate the material parameter by measurements carried out on the complete tyre. Results from such measurements will be related to the model used for the tyre (e. g. ring model, orthotropic plate, etc.). The material data obtained in such way are consequently a function of both the tyre structure and the model, which is used to update the data. A method for experimental collection of global material data for tyres has been developed. This method is based on the experimental characterisation of tyres by <b>driving</b> <b>point</b> and transfer <b>mobilities</b> and the use of the orthotropic plate tyre model for updating the material data...|$|R

40|$|An {{expression}} of the piano soundboard mechanical mobility (in the direction normal to the soundboard) depending on {{a small number of}} parameters and valid up to several kHz is given in this communication. Up to 1. 1 kHz, our experimental and numerical investigations confirm previous results showing that the soundboard behaves like a homogeneous plate with isotropic properties and clamped boundary conditions. Therefore, according to the Skudrzyk mean-value theorem (Skudrzyk 1980), only the mass of the structure M, the modal density n(f), and the mean loss factor eta(f), are needed to express the average <b>driving</b> <b>point</b> <b>mobility.</b> Moreover, the {{expression of}} the envelope - resonances and antiresonances - of the mobility can be derived, according to (Langley 1994). We measured the modal loss factor and the modal density of the soundboard of an upright piano in playing condition, in an anechoic environment. The measurements could be done up to 2. 5 kHz, with a novel high-resolution modal analysis technique (see the ICA companion-paper, Ege and Boutillon (2010)). Above 1. 1 kHz, the change in the observed modal density together with numerical simulations confirm Berthaut's finding that the waves in the soundboard are confined between adjacent ribs (Berthaut et al. 2003). Extending the Skudrzyk and Langley approaches, we synthesize the mechanical mobility at the bridge up to 2. 5 kHz. The validity of the computation for an extended spectral domain is discussed. It is also shown that the evolution of the modal density with frequency is consistent with the rise of mobility (fall of impedance) in this frequency range and that both are due to the inter-rib effect appearing when the half-wavelength becomes equal to the rib spacing. Results match previous observations by Wogram (1980), Conklin (1996), Giordano (1998), Nakamura (1983) and could be used for numerical simulations for example. This approach avoids the detailed description of the soundboard, based on a very high number of parameters. However, {{it can be used to}} predict the changes of the <b>driving</b> <b>point</b> <b>mobility,</b> and possibly of the sound radiation in the treble range, resulting from structural modifications.

40|$|International audienceUp {{to around}} 1. 1 kHz, the {{soundboard}} {{of the piano}} behaves like a homogeneous plate whereas upper in frequency, it {{can be described as}} a set of waveguides defined by the ribs. In consequence: a) The acoustical coincidence phenomenon is deeply modified in comparison with that occurring in homogeneous plates since the dispersion curve of a waveguide can present none, one, or two coincidence frequencies. This may result in a nonuniformity of the soundboard radiation in the treble range, corresponding to the so-called killer octave, where a good sustain is difficult to obtain. b) The mobility (mechanical admittance) in the direction normal to the soundboard can be synthesised with {{only a small number of}} parameters. It compares well with published measurements (Giordano, JASA, 1998), in particular the step-like falloff of the local impedance due to the localisation of the waves between ribs. c) The synthesised mobility has the same features as those which can be derived independantly, according to Skudrzyk (JASA, 1980) and Langley (JSV, 1994).

40|$|Most {{traditional}} tyre models {{concern the}} low and middle frequency ranges. For improved accuracy in tyre/road interaction models {{it is necessary}} to include higher frequencies. Often only the radial direction is included, although the tangential direction may be important, especially studying stick slip motion in the contact between tyre and road surface. Designing accurate and efifcient models requires insight into the behaviour of the tyre structure at higher frequencies to make the models as complete as necessary without creating tools that are computationally too costly. To add insight to this area, experimental studies were done on four different tyres with the same internal design but with different tread patterns. Point mobilities were measured and compared with two different tyre models, a two-layer plate model based on the elastic field equations and an orthotropic plate model. The results of this study underline the importance of the local deformation when there are forces that act with small excitation areas on the tread. Adequate consideration of the tread properties in the tyre/road interaction models is thus of extreme importance to obtain the correct local contact force distribution. This is most important for the tangential <b>driving</b> <b>point</b> <b>mobility.</b> Tread patterns are shown mainly to modify the flexural stiffness in comparison to smooth tyres, while block resonances are not expected to be located in the frequency range in which tyre/road noise is important...|$|E

The obtained results are compared to the developed numerical model, as a means of validation. The profiles of the tapered hole in the plates are designed to replicate near zero reflection of quasi-plane waves from a tapered hole in geometrical acoustics approximation, also known as acoustic black hole effect. The <b>driving</b> <b>point</b> <b>mobility</b> measurements are provided, showing a comparison of the results for a constant thickness circular plate, a constant thickness plate with a layer of damping film applied and a plate with a quadratic power-law profile machined into the center, which is tested with a thin layer of elastic damping material attached. The results indicate a substantial suppression of resonant peaks, agreeing with a numerical model, which is based on the analytical solution available for the vibration of a plate with a central quadratic power-law profile. The paper contains results for the case of free boundary conditions on all edges of the plates, with emphasis placed on the predictions of resonant frequencies and the amplitudes of vibration and loss factor.

40|$|Some of the compromises {{inherent}} in using a passive system to isolate delicate equipment from base vibration {{can be avoided}} using fully active skyhook damping. Ideally, a secondary force, which is made proportional to the absolute equipment velocity by a feedback controller, acts only on the equipment and so {{the response of the}} system under control, between the secondary force input and the collocated velocity output, i. e., the plant response, is proportional to the <b>driving</b> <b>point</b> <b>mobility</b> of the mounted equipment. The frequency response of the plant is guaranteed to have a positive real part under these ideal conditions, and so the feedback system is unconditionally stable for any positive real feedback gain. In practice, the actuator generating the secondary force must either react off the base structure or an inertial mass. In both of these cases the plant response is no longer guaranteed to be positive real and so the control system may become unstable at high gains. Expressions for the overall plant responses are derived for both of these arrangements, in terms of the dynamic response of the individual parts of the isolation system. When using a soft mount, the stability of the reactive system is found to be surprisingly tolerant of the additional contributions to the plant response from the reactive force. In order for the inertial system to be stable with a high feedback gain, however, the natural frequency of the actuator must be well below the natural frequency of the equipment on the mounts. Experimentally measured plant responses are compared with those predicted from theory for both types of actuator and the performance of practically implemented feedback controllers is discussed...|$|E

Recently, it was proposed to use waveguide absorbers {{as a means to}} reduce structural vibrations. A waveguide absorber is a device which is made from damping material but mounted to the structure at a point rather than the full surface. A waveguide absorber removes and then dissipates vibrational energy from the structure through traveling waves. The performance of a waveguide absorber is determined from the <b>driving</b> <b>point</b> impedance, the ratio of force to velocity at the attachment point. This study has determined the theoretical <b>driving</b> <b>point</b> impedance for viscoelastic circular plates. The constitutive relations for viscoelastic material were evaluated and it was proven that a complex Young's modulus and shear modulus can be used to represent the viscoelastic material. Mindlin's theory for elastic isotropic plates, with complex moduli, was used to solve for the <b>driving</b> <b>point</b> impedance. The solutions are in terms of Bessel functions. Poisson's boundary conditions were used at the free edge of the circular plate, and clamped boundary conditions were used at the attachment point, which {{is at the center of}} the plate. A non-numeric language, REDUCE, was used to solve for the <b>driving</b> <b>point</b> impedance given the appropriate equations of motion and boundary conditions. The complex Bessel functions, needed for the results of the REDUCE program, were generated by a FORTRAN program. To validate the results of this study, elastic and viscoelastic plates were tested to determine their <b>driving</b> <b>point</b> impedance.
