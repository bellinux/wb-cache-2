5|$|Alex convinces Principal Skinner {{to have a}} school-dance {{rather than}} the regular yearly event of apple picking. Skinner agrees, so Alex and Lisa, {{accompanied}} by Sherri, Terri, Janey and Allison visit the mall to purchase party supplies, but the girls detour and begin trying on outfits for the dance, despite Lisa's protests. The group leave the mall, none speaking to each other. Lisa decides not to attend the dance, but changes her mind {{and goes to the}} school to take tickets at the door, but later arrives and discovers the boys and girls are standing on <b>different</b> <b>sides</b> of the room, and explains to Alex that it is like this because they are only children, not adults.|$|E

Then scenes of Rihanna walking {{on the beach and}} Rihanna curling up on the chair are shown. This is followed by her own and her partner holding each other closely in bed, sitting on <b>different</b> <b>sides</b> of a large bed, and other scenes featuring Rihanna singing through sheer curtains and drapery. In the video there are also black-white scenes showing Rihanna touching to a stone wall.|$|E

5|$|The {{guns were}} {{controlled}} from a Battery Commander's Post on the roof, from where commands {{to the gun}} detachments could be relayed via voice pipes. Three depression range finders were installed on the roof by the late 1890s to aid the guns' targeting. A well-trained crew could fire each gun once every two minutes. Rather than firing all the guns at once, the guns were positioned {{so that they could}} be fired in sequence as an enemy ship passed by. When combined with the fire from Shornemead and Cliffe Forts on the Kent shore, this would ensure that constant fire could be maintained from three <b>different</b> <b>sides.</b>|$|E
5|$|Carmella's {{relationship}} with Connor was originally scripted for Nina Tucker, but {{was transferred to}} Carmella by the producers on Goodrem's departure. Upon Carmella's introduction, her only family member was her mobster father Rocco, who {{had been sent to}} prison. In 2006, Carmella was given a sister, when Natalie Saleeba was cast in the role of Rosetta Cammeniti. Blair opined that Rosie's inclusion brought out <b>different</b> <b>sides</b> to Carmella's character. Many viewers told Blair they felt the casting was good because they look alike. One of the significant changes to Carmella was that she started having fun again—Blair felt this meant they worked well together. Later, Erin McNaught was cast as her cousin Sienna Cammeniti. McNaught commented {{that there had been a}} rivalry between the cousins in their youth, so it would be interesting to see what unfolded between them.|$|E
5|$|In March 1948 Rau became {{chairman}} of the German Economic Commission (Deutsche Wirtschaftskommission or DWK), which during this period became the centralised administrative organisation for the Soviet Occupation Zone and the predecessor of the future East German government. The organisation existed {{during a time of}} very difficult challenges coming from <b>different</b> <b>sides.</b> A particularly momentous event during this time was the currency reform of 1948. On 20June 1948 the western German zones introduced a new currency, leaving the eastern zone to use the old common currency. In order to avoid inflation, the DWK under Rau's leadership, was forced to follow quickly with its own reform and issued an own currency too. In doing so, the DWK also exploited the currency reform to redistribute capital by using different exchange rates for private and state-run companies. The disagreement, which of the two new currencies should be used in Berlin, triggered the Berlin Blockade by the USSR and the western airborne supply of West Berlin.|$|E

5|$|In their mobility, Khalid's {{troops had}} no match until the Mongol hordes of the 13th century. In fact {{the tactics of}} the desert Arabs and steppe Mongols were {{somewhat}} identical. Entire troops of Khalid would ride on camels while on march, whereas the Mongols used horses, with the difference that the Arabs did not make use of mounted archers. His most commonly used maneuver was surprise attack, such as his night attacks from three <b>different</b> <b>sides</b> on Persian camps at Zumail, Muzayyah and Saniyy, his highly mobile army successfully maneuvering in a 100km area, quickly destroying encampments of the Persians and their Arab allies. The Battle of Maraj-al-Debaj being no exception, where once again his highly mobile army maneuvered around a Byzantine army, appearing from four directions and opening several fronts at a time, a maneuver which later in 13th century {{became one of the}} Mongol armies' principal maneuvers.|$|E
5|$|Levels {{of genetic}} {{diversity}} within individual populations of B.cuneata are unusually high {{for a rare}} and endangered species, but the populations fall into two genetically distinct groups. These are separated not by geographical distance but by the Salt River, an ephemeral saline river system that provides a habitat unsuitable for both B.cuneata and the birds that pollinate it. It thus functions {{as a barrier to}} the exchange of genetic material, allowing populations on <b>different</b> <b>sides</b> of the river to diverge through genetic drift. The implication for conservation is that effort should be invested {{on both sides of the}} river in order to conserve as much genetic diversity as possible. It was suggested that one large population from each population group would probably be adequate. More recently, however, a model-based risk analysis found that the population size required to reduce extinction risk to acceptable levels is more than ten times the current population size. This leads to the conclusion that all populations, and all available habitat, should be protected.|$|E
5|$|Sheffield United {{played their}} inaugural league fixture {{as part of}} the Midland Counties League on 13 September 1890 against the now defunct Burton Wanderers. Since that game they have faced 113 <b>different</b> <b>sides</b> in league {{football}} with their most regular opponent having been Blackburn Rovers, against whom United have played on 140 occasions since their first meeting on 15 January 1894. As such United have registered more wins against the Lancashire side than any other, triumphing on 53 occasions. The most league defeats suffered by United have come against West Midlands team Aston Villa who have beaten them on 58 occasions, while the most draws have been registered against cross-city rivals Sheffield Wednesday with whom they have shared the points in 36 games. The most recent new league opponents for Sheffield United have been Crawley Town, who they first met on 22 November 2012 in a League One fixture.|$|E

5|$|Sonic Adventure 2 is a 3D {{game with}} six playable {{character}}s, {{divided into two}} campaigns: Hero (with Sonic, Tails and Knuckles the Echidna, where the player battles to save the world) and Dark (with Shadow the Hedgehog, Doctor Eggman and Rouge the Bat, where they battle to conquer it). Each character on each side has a playing style similar to the other characters on the side. The player moves through the Hero and Dark campaigns, switching between them at will. Each campaign cycles through levels of its three characters, telling <b>different</b> <b>sides</b> of the story. Levels {{have a variety of}} themes (such as cities, jungles, desert pyramids and outer space), with some followed by boss fights. The two campaigns' stories occur in parallel; completing both campaigns unlocks a Last Story with all six characters, culminating in a final boss fight.|$|E
5|$|South Africa {{have played}} four <b>different</b> <b>sides</b> in women's Test cricket, with England their most {{frequent}} opponent, having faced them in six Tests. The only side that South Africa have beaten in Test cricket are the Netherlands, who South Africa have played once, in 2007. South Africa have similarly faced England {{more times than}} any other team in women's One Day International cricket, playing 33 matches. As such, England have recorded the most victories against South Africa, beating them 25 times. South Africa have beaten Pakistan more times than any other country, triumphing on twelve occasions against them. In women's T20Is, South Africa have as well played England the most, and lost to them on thirteen occasions. South Africa have recorded the most victories against Ireland, beating them in nine of their meetings.|$|E
5|$|The first British {{attack on}} Nalapani {{took place on}} 31 October, a day before the {{official}} declaration of war. Gillespie planned to storm the fort from four sides. The storming party was formed into four columns, support by a reserve: the first, under Colonel Carpenter, consisted of 611 men; the second, under Captain Fast, was 363 strong; the third, under Major Kelly, {{was made up of}} 541 men; the fourth, under Captain Campbell, had 283 men; while 939 men made up the reserve, under Major Ludlow. It was intended for these columns to ascend from different points, at a signal made through the guns firing in a specific manner, and thus attack the Nepalese from <b>different</b> <b>sides.</b> In doing so, the British hoped to divert the attention of the Nepalese and prevent them from concentrating their fire on any one point, allowing the attackers to gain an advantage.|$|E
40|$|Seven {{differently}} linked glycosyl residues {{have been}} found to be glycosidically linked to O- 4 of the branched 2, 4 -linked l-rhamnosyl residues contained in the rhamnosyl and galacturonosyl backbone of the cell wall pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan I. These seven glycosyl residues are, therefore, the first residues of at least seven <b>different</b> <b>side</b> chains attached to the rhamnogalacturonan backbone. These first side chain glycosyl residues are 5 -linked l-arabinofuranosyl and terminal 3 -, 4 -, 6 -, 2, 6 -, and 3, 6 -linked d-galactopyranosyl residues. The existence of at least seven <b>different</b> <b>side</b> chains in rhamnogalacturonan I indicates that rhamnogalacturonan I is either an exceedingly complex polysaccharide or that rhamnogalacturonan I is a family of polysaccharides with similar or identical rhamnogalacturonan backbones substituted with <b>different</b> <b>side</b> chains...|$|R

She spends several months in physical and psychological therapy, and when the suspect is arrested, she refuses to identify him. After his release, she kills him outside a bar. Ana Lucia decides to leave the force and eventually finds work as an airport security guard. She meets Christian Shephard (John Terry) at the airport bar, who asks her to accompany him to Sydney as a bodyguard, however in Sydney the two part ways. Ana Lucia buys a ticket on Oceanic Flight 815 to return to Los Angeles. In a brief flashback in the first season finale, she flirts with Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) at a bar at the airport, unaware he is Christian's son. The pair arrange to continue their conversation during the flight. During the flight the plane splits in half, with the two parts crashing on <b>different</b> <b>sides</b> of an island; Ana Lucia is one of the tail section survivors.|$|E
