Belgian forces took up their deployment positions. The Allied armies had enacted their Dyle plan {{on the morning}} of 10 May, and were approaching the Belgian rear. King Leopold had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> Headquarters near Briedgen, Antwerp.|$|E
25|$|Cal {{had already}} had a taste of power in Dredd's absence, Goodman not being in a fit state to govern because of his grief over Dredd's sentence. Unwilling to wait any longer, Cal ordered his assassins to stab Goodman {{to death in the}} street, whereupon he {{automatically}} succeeded to the city's highest office. He had Judge Dredd shot and the mayor arrested, and immediately began a despotic reign of terror. By this time the power had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> head and he became openly insane. He appointed his own pet goldfish to the vacant position of deputy chief judge, and made criticising the chief judge a capital offence. He was able to get away with this because he had brainwashed the majority of the judges into obeying his every order.|$|E
25|$|Sir Launfal has <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> room, but his faerie {{mistress}} {{does not}} appear and Sir Launfal soon realises why. Tryamour will no longer come {{to him when he}} wishes for her since he has given away her existence. Soon, her gifts have disappeared or changed. Now he is brought to trial. Since the jury of his peers all know that the Queen is more likely to have propositioned Launfal than the other way around, they believe Launfal's version of the encounter. However, for his insult he is given a year and a fortnight to produce the beautiful lady as proof of his boast; Guenevere says she is willing to be blinded if he manages to produce such a woman. As the day of the proof progresses, the Queen presses for him to be executed while others express doubt, particularly when two parties of gorgeous women ride up. Finally Tryamour arrives and exculpates Launfal on both counts. She breathes on Guenevere and blinds her. Gyfre, now visible, brings his horse Blaunchard, and Tryamour, Launfal, and her ladies ride away to the island of Olyroun, which in Marie de France's twelfth-century version of the tale is Avalon. Once a year, on a certain day, Sir Launfal returns and his horse may be heard neighing and a knight may joust with him, although he was never seen again in Arthur's land.|$|E

500|$|After Van Gogh's death, {{memorial}} exhibitions {{were held}} in Brussels, Paris, The Hague and Antwerp. His work was shown in several high-profile exhibitions, including six works at Les XX; in 1891 there was a retrospective exhibition in Brussels. In 1892 Octave Mirbeau wrote that Van Gogh's suicide was an [...] "infinitely sadder loss for art... even though the populace has not crowded to a magnificent funeral, and poor Vincent van Gogh, whose demise means the extinction of a beautiful flame of genius, has <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> death as obscure and neglected as he lived." ...|$|E
500|$|Berry died in 1416 with no male heir, {{and deeply}} in debt. Those {{of his works}} in {{precious}} metal and jewels that had not already <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> creditors were mostly seized by the English when they took Paris in July 1417. This {{was the first of}} a number of periods that saw the large-scale destruction of goldsmiths' work that the cup escaped, but thousands of other pieces did not, a survival that Brigitte Buettner finds [...] "almost miraculous". In particular, the move to Spain in 1604 enabled it to avoid the dispersal and destruction of the English Crown Jewels and royal collection of plate under the English Commonwealth.|$|E
500|$|Aubrey's success {{seemed to}} have <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> head and he became even more arrogant. He was abusive to the network's affiliates, advertisers, {{producers}}, and talent. Friends of Aubrey's such as producers Dick Dorso of United Artists, Martin Ransohoff of Filmways, and David Susskind, who had each sold several series to CBS, suddenly found themselves shut out. [...] "He's a friend of mine, but he cut me stone cold last year," [...] Susskind said. [...] "I was hanging there with my pants down, wondering what I'd tell the stockholders." [...] Gossip columnist Liz Smith, who worked as CBS during Aubrey's time there, called him a [...] "a mean, hateful, truly scary, bad, outré guy." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall wrote that [...] "Timothy Dalton was everything {{we had come}} to expect from him in the part: scary and dangerous and then so much the funnier for the way he kept trying to work the steps and turn over a new leaf. The episode left 's sincerity up in the air for most of the hour - was he really serious about making amends, or just trying to distract Chuck from his latest evil plan? - but Volkoff is such a well-drawn character, and Dalton so talented and versatile, that the comedy worked either way... Vivian, on the other hand? I'd been iffy on her in her most recent appearance, and putting her on camera with , even briefly, was just a reminder of how much less she brings to the table." [...] Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club gave the episode a A-. Though he praised Dalton's performance, McGee wrote, [...] "The direct parallels between Chuck and Vivian haven't really panned out in the way the show initially envisioned it. Let's face it: These two aren't exactly Buffy and Faith in terms of being foils for one another. The show has never painted Chuck as ever potentially going to the dark side. It has used Casey and occasionally Sarah to serve that function at times, but never Chuck. At this point, he's as set in his moral code as possible. Had the Vivian storyline happened at the outset of his Intersect 2.0 days, perhaps the taste of power could have <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> head, with Vivian {{as an example of the}} road not taken. As such, Vivian's existence largely serves to connect her to the larger spy world of the show, not draw a direct parallel to the support system that helped Chuck overcome any potential temptations." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8 out of 10, writing, [...] "This Chuck got off to a shaky start. I don't know how to put my finger on it exactly, but the pacing felt off in the first third or so of the episode... Thankfully, things picked up considerably as the episode went along – I'd say the turning point was the scene in which Chuck was sent in to meet with the pirates. The way Chuck's big announcement that he worked for Alexei Volkoff immediately led to a bunch of guns pulled on him was funny, as was not only Chuck asking to play Uno (for his life), but that the pirate did indeed have the game." [...] Carl Cortez of Assignment X, however, gave the episode a negative review, calling it [...] "a painfully nonsense driven episode that's now grasping at straws in an attempt to round out the last part of the season with an adequate storyline." ...|$|E

Gladstone had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> estate at Hawarden to recover from an illness and thus was not present at the meeting on 18 January where Gordon was given the Sudan command, but he {{was under the impression that}} Gordon's mission was advisory whereas the four ministers present at the meeting had given Gordon the impression that his mission was executive in nature.|$|E

2500|$|LaHaye was a harsh {{critic of}} Roman Catholicism, {{which he called}} [...] "a false religion". In his 1973 book Revelation Illustrated and Made Plain, he stated that the Catholic Church [...] "is more {{dangerous}} than no religion because she substitutes religion for truth" [...] and [...] "is also dangerous because some of her doctrines are pseudo-Christian." [...] Elsewhere the same book compared Catholic ceremonies to pagan rituals. It was these statements that were largely responsible for LaHaye's dismissal from Jack Kemp's presidential campaign. It was later revealed that the San Diego church that LaHaye had pastored throughout the 1970s had sponsored an anti-Catholic group called Mission to Catholics; one of their pamphlets asserted that Pope Paul VI was the [...] "archpriest of Satan, a deceiver, and an antichrist, who has, like Judas, <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> own place." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, Reform {{did not do}} as well as hoped east of Manitoba. It {{was entirely}} shut out of Atlantic Canada [...] a region where a much more {{moderate}} strain of conservatism has traditionally prevailed. Many Red Tory voters in both Atlantic Canada and Ontario were fed up with the Tories, but found Reform's agenda too extreme and shifted to the Liberals, at least at the national level. Despite strong support in rural central Ontario, a very socially conservative area which had been the backbone of previous provincial Tory governments, vote splitting with the national Tories allowed the Liberals to win all but one seat in Ontario. Reform's Ed Harper managed to win in Simcoe Centre, but had 123 more votes <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> Liberal opponent, the Liberals would have had the first-ever clean sweep of Canada's most populous province. As it turned out, this was Reform's only victory east of Manitoba, ever. The party also did not run any candidates in Quebec.|$|E

[...] Instead, he declared that it was Huan Wen's desire that his title be passed to Huan Xuan, and so Huan Xuan, at age four, inherited the title of Duke of Nan Commandery, with the dukedom roughly corresponding to modern Jingzhou, Hubei.|$|E

When the fever developed he directed Abu Bakr to go to the war following Usama who was 18. When Muhammad died Muslims gathered in Al-Masjid al-Nabawi and there were suppressed sobs and sighs. Abu Bakr came from his house at As-Sunh (a village) on a horse where he had been with his new wife. He dismounted and entered the Prophet's Mosque, but did not speak to anyone until he entered upon 'Aa'isha. He went straight to Muhammad who was covered with Hibra cloth (a kind of Yemenite cloth). He then uncovered Muhammad's face and bowed over him and kissed him and wept, saying, [...] "Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you. By Allah, Allah will never cause you to die twice.

The reverend professor is universally loved and respected by all, and it is hoped that he will soon be restored to his accustomed health." [...] The stroke affected his speech and left him partially paralyzed on the right side - unable to perform further either as a professor or in the ministry.
