25|$|US {{involvement}} in the European war also led to formalization of security measures along the border. In an effort to exercise greater control over the border zone, the State Department called on American citizens to register for passports as soon as possible. These new regulations had a profound impact, as they halted the free transit across the open and unobstructed <b>international</b> <b>line</b> that had defined the relationship between Ambos Nogales. Moreover, entry into Nogales, Arizona, was now restricted to designated inspection stations along International Street, with soldiers posted at intervals along the <b>international</b> <b>line</b> to control human traffic into the US. For nogalenses who were accustomed to free passage between the two cities, these rules demanded a difficult adjustment that led to growing hostility between citizens of the two countries.|$|E

25|$|By August 1918 the US State Department had {{tightened}} wartime {{control at}} the border by limiting passport-carrying Mexican laborers to two entries per day and restricting nonworkers to one crossing per week. A Nogales newspaper reported that the new rules had “greatly curtailed traffic from the Mexican side of the international border, and there is universal weeping among retail merchants of Nogales, Arizona, who see ‘panicky’ times ahead, for those who depend on citizens {{of the other side}} of the <b>international</b> <b>line,</b> to swell their daily receipts.” Although businesses in Nogales, Arizona, protested, the persons most affected were working-class nogalenses who depended on wages from their jobs in the US.|$|E
500|$|The story {{develops}} into a Kafkaesque nightmare as Bergman, {{besieged by}} autograph hunters, finally decides that Hollywood {{is not for}} him. Unable to get an <b>international</b> <b>line</b> to call Sweden, he tries to escape on foot, pursued by hotel staff, police cars and helicopters [...] "like an actor in a bad, big-budget Hollywood action film". He evades his captors and reaches the seashore, where he prays for deliverance and at last meets the angelic figure of Greta Garbo, who guides him [...] "home to somewhere monochrome, but somewhere {{you will be a}} certain kind of free". A circular plot device concludes and resolves the fantasy.|$|E

2500|$|A {{landmark}} party {{meeting was}} held in December 1963, shortly after a military coup in Saigon in which Diệm was assassinated. North Vietnamese leaders debated the issue of [...] "quick victory" [...] vs [...] "protracted war" [...] (guerrilla warfare). After this meeting, the communist side geared up for a maximum military effort and PAVN troop strength increased from 174,000 {{at the end of}} 1963 to 300,000 in 1964. The Soviets cut aid in 1964 as an expression of annoyance with Hanoi's ties to China. Even as Hanoi embraced China's <b>international</b> <b>line,</b> it continued to follow the Soviet model of reliance on technical specialists and bureaucratic management, as opposed to mass mobilization. The winter of 1964–1965 was a high-water mark for the Việt Cộng, with the Saigon government on the verge of collapse. Soviet aid soared following a visit to Hanoi by Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin in February 1965. Hanoi was soon receiving up-to-date surface-to-air missiles. The U.S. would have 200,000 soldiers in South Vietnam {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E
60|$|It was {{reflection}} such as this, {{only more}} serious and perhaps somewhat desperate, {{that had brought}} Gale down to the border. For some time the newspapers had been printing news of Mexican revolution, guerrilla warfare, United States cavalry patrolling the <b>international</b> <b>line,</b> American cowboys fighting with the rebels, and wild stories of bold raiders and bandits. But as opportunity, and adventure, too, had apparently given him a wide berth in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, he had struck southwest for the Arizona border, where he hoped to see some stirring life. He did not care very much what happened. Months of futile wandering {{in the hope of}} finding a place where he fitted had inclined Richard to his father's opinion.|$|E
