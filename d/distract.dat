40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the nature of}} errors made by drivers when <b>distracted</b> versus not <b>distracted.</b> Participants drove an instrumented vehicle around an urban test route both while <b>distracted</b> (performing a visual detection task) and while not <b>distracted.</b> Two in-vehicle observers recorded the driving errors made, {{and a range of}} other data were collected, including driver verbal protocols, forward, cockpit and driver video, and vehicle data (speed, braking, steering wheel angle, etc.). Classification of the errors revealed that drivers {{were significantly more likely to}} make errors when distracted; although driving errors were prevalent even when not <b>distracted.</b> Interestingly, the nature of the errors made when <b>distracted</b> did not differ substantially from those made when not <b>distracted,</b> suggesting that, rather than making different types of errors, <b>distracted</b> drivers simply make a greater number of the same error types they make when not <b>distracted.</b> Avenues for broadening our understanding of the relationship between distraction and driving errors are discussed along with the advantages of using a multi-method framework for studying driver behaviour...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{previously}} <b>distracting</b> information on memory tests with indirect instructions is usually age-equivalent, while young adults typically show greater explicit memory for such information. This could reflect qualitatively distinct initial processing (encoding) of <b>distracting</b> information by {{younger and older}} adults, but could also be caused by greater suppression of such information by younger adults on tasks with indirect instructions. In Experiment 1, young and older adults read stories containing <b>distracting</b> words, which they ignored, before studying a list of words containing previously <b>distracting</b> items for a free recall task. Half the participants were informed of the presence {{of previously}} <b>distracting</b> items in the study list prior to recall (direct instruction), and half were not (indirect instruction). Recall of previously <b>distracting</b> words was age-equivalent in the indirect condition, but young adults recalled more <b>distracting</b> words in the direct condition. In Experiment 2, participants performed the continuous identification with recognition task, which captures a measure of perceptual priming and recognition on each trial, and is immune to suppression. Priming and recognition of previously <b>distracting</b> words was greater in younger than older adults, suggesting that the young engage in more successful suppression of previously <b>distracting</b> information on tasks in which its relevance is not overtly signaled...|$|R

40|$|Pedestrians, {{much like}} drivers, {{have always been}} engaged in multi-tasking like using {{hand-held}} devices, listening to music, snacking, or reading while walking. The effects {{are similar to those}} experienced by <b>distracted</b> drivers. However, <b>distracted</b> walking has not received similar policies and effective interventions as <b>distracted</b> driving to improve pedestrian safety. This study reviewed the state-of-practice on policies, campaigns, available data, identified research needs, and opportunities pertaining to <b>distracted</b> walking. A comprehensive review of literature revealed that some of the agencies/organizations disseminate useful information about certain <b>distracting</b> activities that pedestrians should avoid while walking to improve their safety. Various walking safety rules/tips have been given, such as not wearing headphones or talking on a cell phone while crossing a street, keeping the volume down, hanging up the phone while walking, being aware of traffic, and avoiding distractions like walking with texting. The majority of the past observational-based and experimental-based studies reviewed in this study on <b>distracted</b> walking is in agreement that there is a positive correlation between distraction and unsafe walking behavior. However, limitations of the existing crash data suggest that <b>distracted</b> walking may not be a severe threat to the public health. Current pedestrian crash data provide insufficient information for researchers to examine the extent to which <b>distracted</b> walking causes and/or contributes to actual pedestrian safety problems...|$|R

While Carter is grabbing hold of the shark's dorsal fin, Preacher shoots the shark with a harpoon, but the spear also goes through Carter's thigh. As the shark breaks through the fence, Carter orders Preacher to connect the trailing wire to a battery, sending an electric current through the wire and to an explosive charge in the harpoon, killing the shark. In the end, Carter managed to free himself in time, and joins Preacher to see a workers' boat en-route on the horizon.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Professionals {{working in}} the {{operating}} room (OR) are subject to various distractions that can be detrimental to their task performance and the quality of their work. This study aimed to quantify the frequency, nature, and effect on performance of (potentially) <b>distracting</b> events occurring during endourological procedures and additionally explored urologists' and residents' perspectives on experienced ill effects due to <b>distracting</b> factors. METHODS: First, observational data were collected prospectively during endourological procedures in one OR of a teaching hospital. A seven-point ordinal scale was used to measure the level of observed interference with the main task of the surgical team. Second, semistructured interviews were conducted with eight urologists and seven urology residents in two hospitals to obtain their perspectives on the impact of <b>distracting</b> factors. RESULTS: Seventy-eight procedures were observed. A median of 20 <b>distracting</b> events occurred per procedure, which corresponds to an overall rate of one <b>distracting</b> event every 1. 8 min. Equipment problems and procedure-related and medically irrelevant communication were the most frequently observed causes of interruptions and identified as the most <b>distracting</b> factors in the interviews. Occurrence of <b>distracting</b> factors in difficult situations requiring high levels of concentration was perceived by all interviewees as disturbing and negatively impacting performance. The majority of interviewees (13 / 15) thought <b>distracting</b> factors impacted more strongly on residents' compared to urologists' performance due to their different levels of experience. CONCLUSION: <b>Distracting</b> events occur frequently in the OR. Equipment problems and communication, the latter both procedure-related and medically irrelevant, have the largest impact on the sterile team and regularly interrupt procedures. <b>Distracting</b> stimuli can influence performance negatively and should therefore be minimized. Further research is required to determine the direct effect of distraction on patient safety...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 30 - 34). Background: In 2010, 3, 092 {{people were}} killed in crashes involving a <b>distracted</b> driver and an estimated additional 416, 000 were injured in motor vehicle crashes involving a <b>distracted</b> driver. There is currently a 17 item scale that predicts the behavior of <b>distracted</b> driving. The {{purpose of this study is}} to model <b>distracted</b> driving using the least number of questions, while maintaining a high predictive value. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed with an anonymous online survey of college-attending drivers, with a 100 % probability sample from students attending 18 different educational institutions across San Diego County, California. Regression analysis identified correlations between predictive variables and total <b>distracted</b> driving scale. Factor analysis assisted in the creation of a scale assessing <b>distracted</b> driving behavior, which served as the key outcome. Results: The four strongest predictors of <b>distracted</b> driving were: self-efficacy in driving while multi-tasking (?? =. 37), perception of how safe multi-tasking while driving is (?? =. 19), social norms (?? =. 29), and driving frequency (?? =. 12). The final regression equation (F (17, 4945) = 224. 31; p <. 0001; R 2 =. 44) explained 44 % of the total variance of an individuals??? total <b>distracted</b> driving score. The internal consistency correlation, using Cronbach???s standardized alpha coefficient, was 0. 88. Principal axis factoring was accomplished using varimax rotation. A five factor scale (eigenvalue 1. 01 - 6. 78 with 64 % variance explained) was derived. Factor loadings ranged from. 43 to. 87. Criterion validity of the brief <b>distracted</b> driving scale was examined by comparing with total <b>distracted</b> driving score. Twelve items were deleted based on inter-item (less than. 30) and item-total (less than. 55) correlations and factor loadings (less than. 45). Five factors emerged and represented behaviors relating to the frequency of talking on the phone, texting, using plug-in devices, and using non-plug-in devices while driving. Conclusions: Data from this study suggest that a <b>distracted</b> driving scale with five questions can be used to assess <b>distracted</b> driving behaviors among college students. Public Health Implications: An online <b>distracted</b> driving scale, such as this one, may be used to deliver immediate personalized feedback as part of an individualized prevention program or applied to a larger audience to evaluate the success of public awareness campaigns...|$|R

5|$|Children {{under five}} years old display the least {{effective}} strategies for delaying gratification, such as looking at the reward and thinking about its arousing features. By 5 years old, most children are able to demonstrate better self-control by recognizing the counter-productivity of focusing on the reward. Five-year-olds often choose instead to actively <b>distract</b> themselves or even use self-instructions to remind themselves of the contingency that waiting produces a reward of a greater value. Between 8 and 13 years old, children develop the cognitive ability to differentiate and employ abstract versus arousing thoughts in order to <b>distract</b> their minds from the reward and thereby increase the delay. Once delaying strategies are developed, the capacity to resist temptation is relatively stable throughout adulthood. Preschoolers' performance on delayed gratification tasks correlates with their adolescent performance on tasks designed to measure similar constructs and processing, which parallels the corresponding development of willpower and the fronto-striatal circuit (neural pathways that connect the frontal lobe to other brain regions). Declines in self-regulation and impulse control in old age predict corresponding declines in reward-delaying strategies, specifically reduced temporal discounting due to a decrease in cooling strategies.|$|E
