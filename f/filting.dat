40|$|Regional 2 D and 3 D seismic {{data from}} the Levant Basin reveal the updip extensional {{component}} of thin-skinned gravity tectonics on this continental margin. Because of its youth (5 - 7 Ma), the earliest stages of deformation of this salt basin are preserved without the severe structural overprinting common on more mature, giant salt-tectonic systems. Extension detaches onto and within Messinian evaporites up to 1800 m thick. By structural restoration, we reconstruct the tectonic evolution of the Messinian evaporites using paleobathymetric constraints from wells and seismic profiles. This analysis suggests that the Mediterranean drawdown during the Messinian Salinity Crisis was ~ 800 m. The 10 - to 15 -km-wide extensional domain tracks the landward pinch-out of the mobile Messinian evaporites against an older Late Miocene scarp. Diachronous extension began {{in the center of}} the margin in the mid-Pliocene, then spread northward in the late Pliocene, then finally southward in the early Pleistocene. Extension continues today on many of the most landward faults. Extensional strain varies greatly along strike from < 1 km to as much as 12 - 15 km. Comparing observations with four end-member conceptual models, we infer that both extension and seaward salt flow thinned the evaporite margin and its overburden. Both processes were triggered by a combination of uplift of the continental shoulder of the Dead Sea Rift and subsidence in the Mediterranean Basin. At least three factors controlled variations in extension: (1) degree of <b>filting</b> of the salt wedge, related to the interplay of coastal uplift and basin subsidence; (2) presence of pre-Messinian canyons overlain by landward salients of salt; and (3) variations in evaporite facies and the proportion of siliciclastic admixture. © 2007 Geological Society of America...|$|E

40|$|Precise spike timing as a {{means to}} encode {{information}} in neural networks is biologically supported, and is advantageous over frequency-based codes by processing input features on a much shorter time-scale. For these reasons, much recent attention has been focused on the development of supervised learning rules for spiking neural networks that utilise a temporal coding scheme. However, despite significant progress in this area, there still lack rules that are theoretically justified, and yet can be considered biologically relevant. Here we examine the general conditions under which optimal synaptic plasticity takes place to support the supervised learning of a precise temporal code. As part of our analysis we introduce two analytically derived learning rules, one of which relies on an instantaneous error signal to optimise synaptic weights in a network (INST rule), and the other one relying on a filtered error signal to minimise the variance of synaptic weight modifications (<b>FILT</b> rule). We test the optimality of the solutions provided by each rule with respect to their temporal encoding precision, and then measure the maximum number of input patterns they can learn to memorise using the precise timings of individual spikes. Our results demonstrate the optimality of the <b>FILT</b> rule in most cases, underpinned by the rule's error-filtering mechanism which provides smooth convergence during learning. We also find the <b>FILT</b> rule to be most efficient at performing input pattern memorisations, and most noticeably when patterns are identified using spikes with sub-millisecond temporal precision. In comparison with existing work, we determine the performance of the <b>FILT</b> rule to be consistent with that of the highly efficient E-learning Chronotron rule, but with the distinct advantage that our <b>FILT</b> rule is also implementable as an online method for increased biological realism...|$|R
40|$|The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is the W 3 C {{recommended}} {{standard for}} {{data on the}} semantic web, while the SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) is the query language that retrieves RDF triples by subject, predicate, or object. RDF data often contain valuable information {{that can only be}} queried through filter functions. The SPARQL query language for RDF can include filter clauses in order to define specific data criteria, such as full-text searches, numerical filtering, and constraints and relationships between data resources. However, the downside of executing SPARQL filter queries is the frequently slow query execution times. Due to the fact that SPARQL filter queries can retrieve information that non-filter SPARQL queries cannot, decreasing the query execution time of SPARQL filter queries will greatly enhance the efficiency of the SPARQL query language. This thesis presents a SPARQL filter query processing engine for conventional triplestores called <b>FILT</b> (Filtering Indexed Lucene Triples), which is built on top of the Apache Lucene framework for storing and retrieving indexed documents. The objective of <b>FILT</b> was to decrease the query execution time of SPARQL filter queries. This was evaluated by performing a benchmark test of <b>FILT</b> compared to the Joseki triplestore, focusing on two different use-cases; SPARQL regular expression filtering in medical data, and SPARQL numerical/logical filtering of geo-coordinates in geographical locations...|$|R

Pups remained with their foster dam until post-natal day 21 (PN 21). Pup body mass was measured twice weekly. At PN 14 <b>FILT</b> pups had a smaller body mass than did the VIV pups (p < 0. 01). Circadian rhythms of body temperature and activity of pups from two <b>FILT</b> dams (n = 8), two FIDS dams (n = 9) and two VIV dams (n = 7) were studied starting from age PN 21.

A filter conflict occurs when two or more filters overlap, creating an ambiguity in packet classification. Current techniques for resolving filter conflicts are based on prioritizing conflicting filters, and choosing the higher priority filter. We show that prioritizing does not always work. Instead, we propose a new scheme for conflict resolution, which is based on the idea of adding resolve filters. Our main results are a geometric framework for studying filters, an algorithm for detecting conflicts in a filter database, and an algorithm for resolving conflicts.

Determination of the sorptive effectiveness, the flow characteristics, and the wet volume secure a more comprehensive quality evaluation. Information on morphological, sorptive, and filtering properties including structure as visualized by electron microscopy is presented on new types of polymeric sorbents developed in the author 2 ̆ 7 s laboratory to be active against beer polyphenols...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} how unsupervised neural networks {{can be used}} to extract features from databases of reflectance spectra. These databases try to sample color space in a way which reflects the properties of human color perception. In our construction of neural networks we identify first desirable properties of the network. These properties are then incorporated into an energy function and finally a learning rule is derived using optimization methods to find weight matrices which lead to minimal values of the energy function. We describe several energy functions and the performance of the resulting networks for the databases with the reflectance spectra. The experiments show that the weight matrix for one of the systems is very similar to the eigenvector system whereas the second type of systems tries to rotate the eigenvector system {{in such a way that}} the resulting filters partition the spectrum into different bands. We will also show how the additional constraint of positive <b>filt</b> [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Multi-resolution {{analysis}} (MRA) {{produces a}} hierarchical basis for representing functions. This basis {{can be used}} to improve the efficiency of many algorithms for computing with those functions. Traditionally, these basis functions are translates and dilates of a single function. In this paper, we outline a generalization of MRA to those functions defined by binary subdivision schemes. Although the mathematical underpinnings of MRA are somewhat involved, the resulting algorithms are quite simple. We start with a brief intuitive description of how the method can be applied to decompose the polyhedral object shown in Figure 1 (a). The main idea behind MRA is the decomposition of an object, in this case a polyhedron, into a low resolution part and a "detail" part. The low resolution part of the polyhedron in Figure 1 (a) is shown in Figure 1 (b). The vertices in (b) are computed as certain weighted averages of the vertices in (a). These weighted averages essentially implement a low pass <b>filt</b> [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Internal {{friction}} of (SiO 2) 1 -x (GeO 2) x glasses (x = 0, 5, 10, 24 and 100 mole%) {{is measured}} at temperatures between 1. 6 and 280 K. The data are <b>filted</b> with the equations for thermally activated relaxation with distributing activation energies in symmetrical double-well potentials. From the determined relaxation strength spectra for each sample, the contributions from {{each type of}} microscopic structural units are calculated assuming that transverse motion of the bridging O atom in Si-O-Si, Si-O-Ge or Ge-O-Ge bridge (T model) is the microscopic unit responsible for relaxation. For instance, the magnitude of internal friction for SiO 2 - 5 % GeO 2 or 24 % GeO 2 is calculated from the data of pure SiO 2, SiO 2 - 10 % GeO 2 and pure GeO 2. The calculated results agree well with the measurements of SiO 2 - 5 % GeO 2 and SiO 2 - 24 % GeO 2. Thus T model is shown to be quantitalively consistent with internal friction of SiO 2 -GeO 2 binary glasses...|$|R
40|$|An {{alternative}} for the Liljencrants-Fant (LF) glottal-pulse model is presented. This alternative {{is derived from}} the Rosenberg model. Therefore, we call it the Rosenberg++ model. In the derivation use a general framework for glottal-pulse models. The Rosenberg++ model is described by the same set of T or R parameters as the LF model but has the advantage over the LF model that it is computationally more efficient. It is compared with the LF model in a psycho-acoustic experiment, from which we conclude that in a practical situation it is capable of producing synthetic speech which is perceptually equivalent to speech generated with the LF model. PACS numbers: 43. 70. Gr, 43. 72. Ja, 43. 71. Bp 3 1. Introduction For analysis and synthesis purposes, speech production is often modelled by a source-filter model. Figure 1 shows two versions of such a source-filter model. On the left we see a model consisting of a source producing a signal which models the airflow passing the vocal cords, a <b>filt</b> [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Auditory nerve fibers in an {{ear with}} outer hair cell damage can be {{conceptualized}} as <b>filt</b> ers having a broadened frequency response area, a shallower phase response and a shorter group delay {{with respect to}} a healthy fiber, particularly at low stimulus presentation levels. As well, the presence of inner hair cell damage requires increased stimulus presentation levels for restoration of fiber discharge rates, which results in broad auditory filters with shallow phase response and short group delay. As a con-sequence, t he discharge times in the impaired ear in response to a tone stimulus are more coincident across a populat ion of fibers with a range of characteristic frequencies. This behaviour resembles the spatiotemporal response pattern in a healt hy auditory periphery in response to loud stimuli and has been postulated as a potential correlate to loudness recruitment. Commercial hearing aids do not address any changes in t he phase characteristics of impaired auditory nerve fibers. The present study evaluates the potent ial for correction of the altered temporal relationships in the neural firing pattern of the impaired ear by a hearing aid. A...|$|R
40|$|Germany, {{initiated}} {{development of}} a spectra library to help clinical and forensic toxicologists identify poisons as quickly as possible. The library contains more than 1, 600 UV spectra of compounds relevant to pharmacology and toxicology. The spectra were measured at the Forschungsgesellschaft für Lungen- und Thoraxerkrankungen (<b>FILT)</b> in Berlin and tested with extracts of human serum, spiked full blood or urine samples and samples taken during the investigation of many real cases of poisoning. The library is divided into sublibraries that enable faster peak identification. Problem-oriented preselection of the match-ing sublibrary allows identification of an analyte with {{a higher degree of}} accuracy. Using this library and a diode-array detector software, ana-lysts can compare the spectrum of an unknown peak with those in the library in a very short time. With relatively simple sample preparation methods, analysts can use this library to identify poisons and their metabolites fast and confidently. The library also offers a link to a data-base that gives each compound's nonproprietary name, CAS number, effect or use, retention time and spectroscopic maxima, minima and shoulders. An easy-to-use manual provides the same data, a printout of each spectrum and the structural formula of each compound. All of this makes the library a valuable tool in forensic, clinical and toxicological analysis...|$|R
