40|$|In Sicily in the 2010 - 2012 period <b>green</b> <b>harvesting</b> is {{the most}} {{successful}} of the 9 measures provided by the Italian National Support Programme (NSP) for wine. Its main goal is to contribute to restoring the balance between supply and demand by destructing or removing grape bunches in their immature stage {{in order to prevent}} market crises. The paper firstly presents the main results of a "three-year" application <b>of</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Harvesting</b> measure to the Sicilian wine sector. Firstly the implementation <b>of</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Harvesting</b> Measure was examined at EU, national and regional level through the analysis of the available statistical data; at a later stage its effects on the Sicilian wine sector were investigated. The trend of vineyard area and wine production was studied by comparing them before and throughout the application <b>of</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Harvesting.</b> Another stage <b>of</b> the research consisted of a survey carried out through direct interviews to 30 Sicilian wine cooperatives, the aim of which was to collect and analyse the trend of grape quantities delivered to the cooperatives, as well as the correspondent prices concerning the last 6 grape harvests (2007 - 2012). Another aim of the research was to collect the most common viewpoints and impressions of people working in the wine sector cooperatives with regards to the above-mentioned measure. The study has pointed out that "Green Harvesting" has been contributing - together with other elements - to reduce the supply of wine grape in Sicily and partially to raise the prices of the wines involved in this region. This measure has been however object of criticisms in relation to its impact in economic, social and ethical terms...|$|R

While it is a popular process, it also has its opponents, such as Jean Gautreau of Château Sociando-Mallet, Gonzague Lurton of Château Durfort-Vivens and Olivier Bernard of Domaine de Chevalier, who claim that the remaining berries simply grow bigger, not better. <b>Green</b> <b>harvesting</b> requires cheap labor, often ignorant of properly cutting vines. Opponents point to vintages 1929 and 1947, which were high-yield and of great quality—and made entirely without <b>green</b> <b>harvest</b> techniques.|$|R

40|$|The <b>green</b> cane <b>harvesting</b> {{represented}} {{a significant change}} in sugarcane ecosystem due to the presence of straw left on the soil and to the absence of fire. These two factors may affect the populations of pests and their natural enemies. Among the pests benefit from the <b>green</b> cane <b>harvesting</b> stand out the spittlebug, Mahanarva fimbriolata, the curculionid Sphenophorus levis and sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis. In areas <b>of</b> <b>green</b> cane <b>harvesting,</b> the population of these species grew faster than in areas of burnt cane. On the other hand, there are virtually no records of attacks by lesser cornstalk borers in areas <b>of</b> <b>green</b> cane <b>harvesting.</b> Populations <b>of</b> plant parasitic nematodes and the beetles Migdolus fryanus, very important pests of sugarcane, were apparently not affected by the <b>green</b> cane <b>harvesting.</b> Despite the absence of more consistent information, it appears that populations of ants and the giant borer Telchin licus can increase in green cane areas, due primarily to the difficulty of pest control. The partial or total removal of straw from the field represents an additional change to the ecosystem that could alter the status of pests and nematodes. It is likely that spittlebug, the curculionid S. levis and sugarcane borer populations decrease if a portion of the straw is removed from the field. However, the pest populations in areas where the straw is collected will not return to their original conditions at the time of burnt cane harvesting because the absence of fire will be maintained...|$|R
