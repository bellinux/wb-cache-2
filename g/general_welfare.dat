5|$|Among {{the ways}} that the {{government}} could assist in manufacturing, Hamilton mentioned levying protective duties on imported foreign goods that were also manufactured in the United States, to withdraw duties levied on raw materials needed for domestic manufacturing, pecuniary boundaries, and encouraging immigration for people to better themselves in similar employment opportunities. Congress shelved the report without much debate (except for Madison's objection to Hamilton's formulation of the <b>General</b> <b>Welfare</b> clause, which Hamilton construed liberally as a legal basis for his extensive programs).|$|E

5|$|According to Jainism, {{the purpose}} of nonviolence is {{not because it is}} a commandment of a God or any other supreme being. Its purpose is also not simply because its {{observance}} is conducive to <b>general</b> <b>welfare</b> of the state or the community. While it is true that in Jainism, the moral and religious injunctions were laid down as law by Arhats who have achieved perfection through their supreme moral efforts, their adherence is just not to please a God, but the life of the Arhats has demonstrated that such commandments were conductive to Arhat's own welfare, helping him to reach spiritual victory. Just as Arhats achieved spiritual victory by observing non-violence, so can anyone who follows this path.|$|E
5|$|Fundamental rights {{primarily}} protect {{individuals from}} any arbitrary state actions, but some rights are enforceable against individuals. For instance, the Constitution abolishes untouchability and also prohibits begar. These provisions {{act as a}} check both on state action {{as well as the}} action of private individuals. However, these rights are not absolute or uncontrolled and are subject to reasonable restrictions as necessary for the protection of <b>general</b> <b>welfare.</b> They can also be selectively curtailed. The Supreme Court has ruled that all provisions of the Constitution, including fundamental rights can be amended. However, the Parliament cannot alter the basic structure of the constitution. Since the fundamental rights can be altered only by a constitutional amendment, their inclusion is a check not only on the executive branch but also on the Parliament and state legislatures.|$|E
5|$|Most Catholic clergy in Buenos Aires willingly backed Rosas' regime. The Jesuits, {{the only}} ones who refused to do so, were {{expelled}} from the country. The lower social strata in Buenos Aires, which formed the vast majority of its populace, experienced no improvement in the conditions under which they lived. When Rosas slashed expenditures, he cut resources from education, social services, <b>general</b> <b>welfare</b> and public works. None of the lands confiscated from Indians and Unitarians were turned over to rural workers, including gauchos. Black people did not experience any improvement in their conditions either. Rosas was himself a slave-owner, and helped revive the slave trade. Despite doing little to promote their interests, he remained popular among blacks and gauchos. He employed blacks, patronized their festivities and attended their candombles. The gauchos admired his leadership and willingness to fraternize with them to some extent.|$|E

5|$|The 1845 {{legislature}} met {{three different}} times, under two different structures. First, from June 24 to July 5, 1845, the legislature met in Oregon City, {{first at the}} home of John E. Long and then the home of Theophilus R. Magruder, with Morton M. McCarver serving as the speaker of the group. After this, the Organic Laws were replaced with the Organic Act of 1845, which altered the legislature in several ways. First the number of representatives was increased to include a minimum of 13 and a maximum of 61. Second, the name was changed to the House of Representatives. All members of the body were to be elected by popular vote with vacancies filled using special elections. The body also received new powers to impeach any civil official by a 3/4ths vote, apportion the legislators among the districts, create post offices, levy taxes, declare war, organize and call out the militia, create lower courts, pass laws concerning the <b>general</b> <b>welfare</b> of the region, regulate trade with the Native Americans, regulate liquor sale and manufacture, and regulate the police power of the government, among other powers. Meetings continued to be in June and December.|$|E
