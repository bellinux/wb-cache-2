25|$|The {{water or}} {{retardant}} is carried in three center-line belly tanks. The tanks have internal baffles to prevent fluid shift (and consequent shift {{in center of}} gravity) while in flight, and sit with a 15-inch (38cm) ground clearance. All three tanks can be filled simultaneously {{on the ground in}} eight minutes. The retardant is gravity-fed out of the tanks, and the entire load can be dumped in eight seconds, although the actual <b>drop</b> <b>rate</b> is computer controlled by the flight crew in order to produce the desired retardant spread over the fire lines. The aircraft is capable of applying a line of retardant 300ft (91m) wide by 1 mile (1.6km) long.|$|E
2500|$|There is a flat [...] "flag drop" [...] rate, {{which is}} $2.60 for Metro, $2.50 for Yellow. [...] Once in the car, {{there are two}} rates: mileage and time.

30|$|Thus, {{due to the}} {{influence}} of the high electric field, the increase of <b>dropping</b> <b>rate</b> was confirmed after impressed voltage was applied. Such increase of droplets is remarkable with the increase of the initial <b>dropping</b> <b>rate</b> of electrolyte. The increase of droplets promoted the lowering of hydrophobicity, and the hydrophobicity loss time became shorter. The surface of the test sample has a greater opportunity to attach NaCl and keeps electrification on the surface of SiR with the increase of the <b>dropping</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|R
30|$|Figure 6 (a) {{shows the}} packet <b>dropping</b> <b>rate</b> of the CBR, MVBR, and UVBR for {{different}} CBR arrival rates. The average packet <b>dropping</b> <b>rate</b> of the CBR is always {{lower than the}} others and is maintained at about 0.005. This shows that the proposed TSAQM can achieve the dropping guideline of CBR traffic. The packet <b>dropping</b> <b>rate</b> of MVBR is lower than UVBR due to the DRBS distributing residue bandwidth to MVBR through threshold adjustment. When the UVBR <b>dropping</b> <b>rate</b> is about 15 %, {{it means that the}} DRBS does not allocate the bandwidth to the 5 th layer video stream. Where the arrival rate of the CBR is between 0.085 (flows/sec) and 0.095 (flows/sec), the UVBR <b>dropping</b> <b>rate</b> is about 23 %, meaning that the DRBS does not allocate the bandwidth to the 4 th layer video stream. The UVBR <b>dropping</b> <b>rate</b> is between 23 % and 30 %, {{and in the case of}} the arrival rate of the CBR being between 0.15 (flows/sec) and 0.105 (flows/sec), it means that the DRBS does not allocate the bandwidth to the 3 rd layer video stream. Similarly, in the case of the arrival rate of the CBR being higher than 1.0 (flows/sec), the 5 th layer video stream will be dropped for the MVBR.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to determine the minimum system <b>dropping</b> <b>rate</b> (or, equivalently, <b>dropping</b> probability) induced by time division multiple access (TDMA) schemes supporting time-constrained applications with common maximum cell delay tolerance. Expressions are derived for the induced system <b>dropping</b> <b>rate</b> for various TDMA schemes with different overhead and the maximum number of users than can be admitted in the network without violating the maximum <b>dropping</b> <b>rate</b> constraint is determined. The system <b>dropping</b> <b>rate</b> achieved by suboptimal TDMA schemes is compared against the optimal (although ideal) TDMA scheme performance. The performance limiting factors associated with the suboptimal schemes are identified, and the magnitude of their (negative) impact is evaluated. Based on this information it is possible to point to performance improving modifications which should be pursued to the extent permitted by technological constraints. Finally, based on this derivations a network designer may choose the best TDMA scheme—among realizable variations of those considered here—to use in a particular situation.

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{the application of}} Taguchi approach in investigating the performance of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) with respect to <b>drop</b> <b>rates.</b> The performance of MANETs was in?uenced very much by the routing protocol designs and quantitative factors such as network size, terrain, pause-time, node speed, transmission range, tra?c load, and packet rates.

The tools of Taguchi approach such as L 12 orthogonal array, analysis of signal-to-noise ratio, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were employed. Results showed that the e?ects of network size, terrain, node speed, transmission range, tra?c load, packet rates, and routing were found to be statistically signi?cant, and the most signi?cant factor was transmission range.

40|$|Studies of {{external}} seed transport on animals usually {{assume that the}} probability of detachment is constant, so that seed retention should show a simple exponential relationship with time. This assumption has not been tested explicitly, and may lead to inaccurate representation of long distance seed dispersal by animals. We test the assumption by comparing the fit to empirical data of simple, two-parameter functions. Fifty-two data sets were obtained from five published studies, describing seed retention of 32 plant species on sheep, cattle, deer, goats and mice. Model selection suggested a simple exponential function was adequate for data sets in which seed retention was followed for short periods (< 48 h). The data gathered over longer periods (49 – 219 days) were best described by the power exponential function, a form of the stretched exponential which allows a changing <b>dropping</b> <b>rate.</b> In these cases the power exponential showed that seed <b>dropping</b> <b>rate</b> decreased with time, suggesting that seeds vary in attachment, with some seeds becoming deeply buried or {{wound up in the}} animal's coat. Comparison of fitted parameters across all the data sets also confirmed that seeds with adhesive structures have lower <b>dropping</b> <b>rates</b> than those without. We conclude that the seed <b>dropping</b> <b>rate</b> often changes with time during external transport on animals and that the power exponential is an effective function to describe this change. We advise that, to analyse seed <b>dropping</b> <b>rates</b> adequately, retention should be measured over reasonable time periods – until most seeds are dropped – and both the simple and power exponential functions should be fitted to the resulting data. To increase its utility, we provide functions describing the seed <b>dropping</b> <b>rate</b> and the dispersal kernel resulting from the power exponential relationship. ...|$|R
30|$|Size {{variation}} of the hydrothermal product with the droplet size of the NaOH solution showed that the average length and diameter of the hydrothermal product derived from <b>dropping</b> <b>rate</b> of 0.5 and 1.0 d s− 1 both decreased slightly with the decrease of the droplet size from 0.12 to 0.07 mL d− 1, which however both began to increase when the droplet size further decrease from 0.05 to 0.02 mL d− 1 (Fig. 2 a–b). Meanwhile, within the same range of the droplet size as 0.02 – 0.05 mL d− 1, the average length and diameter of the hydrothermal product increased with the decrease of the <b>dropping</b> <b>rate</b> from 1.00 to 0.5 d s− 1. The specific evolution trend of the average length and diameter of the hydrothermal product (Fig. 2 a–b) determined the corresponding change of the average aspect ratio of the hydrothermal product with the droplet size of the NaOH solution (Fig. 2 c). Remarkably, the average aspect ratio of the hydrothermal product significantly increased for the <b>dropping</b> <b>rate</b> of 0.5 d s− 1 when the droplet size decreased from 0.05 to 0.02 mL d− 1 (Fig. 2 c), similar to the significant increase of the average length and diameter for the same <b>dropping</b> <b>rate</b> within the same range of the droplet size (Fig. 2 a–b). To further investigate {{the effect of the}} feeding mode, the {{variation of}} the particle size of the precursor obtained after the accomplishment of the NaOH feeding was monitored, which revealed a decrease of the precursor particle size with the decrease of the droplet size from 0.12 to 0.02 mL d− 1 (Fig. 2 d). Notably, a significant decrease of the particle size emerged as the droplet size decreased from 0.07 to 0.02 mL d− 1 for the <b>dropping</b> <b>rate</b> of 0.5 d s− 1, in contrast with a steady decrease of the particle size for the <b>dropping</b> <b>rate</b> of 1.0 d s− 1 within the whole droplet size range. Besides, the precursor particle size decreased with the slow-down of the <b>dropping</b> <b>rate</b> from 1.0 to 0.5 d s− 1 under the same droplet size situation, especially for the small droplet size within the range of 0.02 – 0.05 mL d− 1.|$|R
