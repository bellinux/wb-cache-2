In particular for the long-term and large-volume export-import trade, open cover {{insurance is}} almost the inevitable choice. This is because, on the one hand, from the assured’s point of view, open cover insurance can relieve him from repetitive negotiations on the terms and conditions of the cargo insurance for {{the same kind of}} trade, and meanwhile provide some other advantages such as simplified procedures and lower premiums; on the other hand, from the insurer’s point of view, he can benefit from simplified procedures and fixed premium income. This thesis begins with a general introduction to open cover insurance system as such, including the identification of, comparison and interaction between relevant definitions of and documents used in open cover system (Chapter 2). And then the thesis will go on introducing four main and characteristic clauses used in the open cover system, including the rationale behind the clauses (Chapter 3). The <b>declaration</b> <b>obligation</b> has certain significance in the whole open cover insurance system, the flaw of which may result in the loss of coverage of concerned shipment(s). Therefore, the second half of this thesis will deliberate on issues regarding <b>declaration</b> <b>obligation.</b> The source, nature, function and practice of declaration will be considered in detail in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 will concentrate on the issues revolving around non-declaration by the assured...|$|E

Scores of statements on various aspects of human rights have been released since the presentation of “A Bahá’í <b>Declaration</b> of Human <b>Obligations</b> and Rights” in 1947. The Bahá’í community is dedicated to the integration of human rights in every aspect of global community life and favours education as the main approach to the promotion and protection of human rights.|$|R
5000|$|The {{church tax}} is only paid {{by members of}} the {{respective}} religious corporate body under public law [...] Those who are not members of a tax collecting denomination are not required to pay it. Members of a religious community which is a corporate body under public law may formally declare to state authorities that they wish to leave the community (this is commonly referred to as [...] "leaving the church"). With such <b>declaration,</b> the <b>obligation</b> to pay church taxes ends. The concerned religious organisations usually refuse to administer rites of passage, such as marriages and burials of (former) members who had seceded. To rejoin a religious corporate body under public law one would get one's declaration of re-entry officially recorded. The Conference of the German Bishops, however, considers the declaration to [...] "leave the church" [...] to be a schismatic act to be punished automatically by excommunication.|$|R
5000|$|As {{mentioned}} before, {{the maintenance}} of a substantially constant buying power of the Swedish and Finnish currencies is not inconsistent with the establishment and maintenance of prosperous economic conditions. On the other hand, there is no record of any experience of sustained economic equilibrium without some degree of price-level stability. In a general way, however, the Board’s declaration conformed to the general principles of monetary stability enunciated by President Roosevelt in 1933, although the President was much more specific than the Board in mentioning the objective of “stable buying power.” The Board declared emphatically what it believed it could not do. As to what it could do, or intended to do, it made, at best, only a vague statement. It may, {{at any time in the}} future, in order to justify an action or lack of action to which it may be inclined, interpret this statement as it pleases or repudiate it altogether. That is, the Board is now free to reserve to itself the widest possible discretion in the use of its powers under any circumstances that may arise. What certainty is there that it has not already changed its mind on the subject without having made another <b>declaration?</b> What <b>obligation</b> would a new member of the Board feel for the opinions expressed by his predecessors? What does the public know of the real aims of the Board? ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} use of {{the terminology}} {{of human rights in}} publications by Bahá’í institutions coincided with the inception of their official relationship with the United Nations. Three of the first four documents submitted to the newly established international organization in 1947 and 1948 were statements on various aspects of human rights intended as contributions to the preparatory work on the UDHR. The first of these was an eight-page statement entitled “A Bahá’í <b>Declaration</b> of Human <b>Obligations</b> and Rights” which was presented to the Human Rights Commission in February 1947 on behalf of eight national Bahá’í administrative bodies.The Bahá’í International Community (BIC) explains that concern for human rights can be found throughout the Bahá’í Writings. Bahá’u’lláh, urged the rulers of the earth to “rule with justice ... safeguard the rights of the down-trodden, and punish the wrong-doers.” He taught that “there shall be an equality of rights and prerogatives for all mankind.” ...|$|R
3000|$|The US’ renewed {{interest}} included the shoring {{up of the}} longstanding US–Philippine strategic alliance with particular attention to maritime cooperation. A series of bilateral strategic dialogues between the Philippines and the US with the inaugural meeting held in late January 2011 affirmed Washington’s support to improve Manila’s territorial defense and maritime security. For instance, under the Excess Defense Articles and Foreign Assistance Act of the US, the US approved the Aquino administration’s request to purchase three Hamilton class cutters and other US naval equipment to aid in patrolling the Spratly waters. During the first strategic dialogue on November 16, 2011, Hillary Clinton came to Manila and signed the Manila Declaration to commemorate the Philippines–US Mutual Defense Treaty’s (MDT) 60 th Anniversary. The signing of the <b>declaration</b> reinforces the <b>obligations</b> under the MDT and signifies their agreement to broaden maritime cooperation. On April 30, 2012, {{in the midst of}} the Scarborough Shoal intimidations, they held the first United States–Philippines Ministerial Dialogue or “ 2 plus 2 ” meetings between their respective top defense officials and diplomats. The dialogue highlighted Washington’s commitment to assist the Philippines in achieving a “minimum deterrent posture” alongside an improved maritime security awareness. The ministerial dialogue occurred just right after the conclusion of a joint military exercise held off the coast of Palawan. With Manila’s drive to build a “minimum credible deterrence posture” through the purchase of weaponry abroad, the Chinese Foreign Ministry gave a strong warning to the Philippines that its move to involve “a third party” would only “further escalate the situation and even change the nature of the issue”. 14 [...]...|$|R
40|$|A {{huge number}} of {{geographical}} and economic theories and applied researches’ experiences inspire the adopting of common (semi-standardised) processes for sustaining long term territorial development (employment, inclusion, GPD growth). It appears like a urgent European Union {{need in order to}} stabilise appropriate territorial integrated strategic investments overcoming shock and sectorial measures of austerity (Junker plan). At the same time, it seems the unique solution for having to react to a pseudo global financial and economic war (geoeconomic and geopolitical play at no summa zero), focusing resources to maintaining the status quo. Starting from a critical review of literature positions, the paper discusses what modelling the European policy action should follow in order to not invalidate the efforts implemented by austerity measures. Multilevel experiences (benchmarking at different geographical scales) from several 2013 programs (mainly ESPON, URBACT, ENPICiBMED) are resumed to demonstrate this thesis. In order to assess and to measure this aim, territorial cohesive capability is considerate the main vehicle for transforming European challenges in common geopolitical goals. So the paper considers the Europe 2020 pillars and flags as a first turning point {{to be related to the}} territorial regional capability of transforming its diversity in cohesive and competitive development. Some words will be spent about the real compliance between Structural Funds objectives, declared priorities of investment, territorial regional capability, including complex and multidisciplinary variables as cohesion, sustainability and subsidiarity confidence in this evaluation. Example of place evidence and economic-social trends from countries, regions and cities are mentioned and compared for fixing the distance among symbolic expected priorities and real potentials at the short time. At this scope the 2020 political addresses by government <b>declarations</b> and <b>obligations,</b> the regional potential attractive capital, the city potential public and private investments are illustrate with particular regard to the Italy position in the Southern of Europe future. The dissertation in the whole pays particular attention to relate the significant of European territorial evidence with the European policy and funds (e. g. the programming for internal areas distinguished respect to the inner areas ones). This permits to better clarify the different impacts and effects produced from European addresses when the national/regional interpretation does not take in account the relationship between territorial evidence and programming obligations that should increase employment and income. Finally, a set of feasible recommendations are launched on the short time providing viable, flexible, proper, effective and resilient answers to existing needs of territorial investments. These are due because expectations of citizens in front of the current period of economic stagnation. The strategic investment, in principle, should help territories (mainly cities) in having major perspective to realise a territorial regeneration accessing to mainstreaming financing linked to the new Structural Funds, which define the perspective horizon of long term European challenges. They imply joint capitalization, which means not just a(nother) prêt-a-portrait concept, and triggers a multifaceted approach ("quick & dirty" ideas / solutions). Drawbacks so far relate to fragmented territorial intelligence and the need for a certain critical mass willing to get involved. We mean the creating models for strategic integrated sustainable planning by addressing the efficiency of technology across various sectors (energy, climate change, public services, accessibility and transport, etc.) in different typologies and dimension of territory. It means supporting territories with the development of ambitious and innovative challenges embedded in comprehensive territorial agenda...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge on and {{application}} of the legislation and professional reasoning in a professional manner related to control and situation in the field, of the control methods and procedures, {{is one of the}} essential premises that ensures efficiency and finality in the activity of patrimony control of an entity in the constructions field. A financial audit, which aims at an integrated control, provides conclusions on the entire activity. It fully characterizes the efforts and the results and it can also show faults, deficiencies and frauds in their entirety. The stocks cannot be simply taken into account as they are in a balance sheet and say straight away that the entity has sufficient stocks and it is performant. It is necessary to have a stock audit in order to highlight the accordance between the records and the physical stocks or their movement. The same reasoning also applies to outstanding debts, purchase/selling of real estate, rents of real estates, verification of contractual <b>obligations,</b> <b>declarations</b> regarding and actual payment of taxes to the state budget and the state social security budget etc. The relationship between audit and the benchmarking plan is given precisely by the final result of a performance evaluation and {{in order to get to}} a correct result it is necessary to have correct data and financial indicators. Otherwise, the risk is to evaluate an entity as performant and shortly after that it goes into bankruptcy. Benchmarking is a support instrument for decision-making, a continuous evaluation process, a mean of looking for the most performant methods to do a given activity. It is a system of information that allows an entity to show its development strategy, a technique for determining its competitive advantages and to learn about its products, services and operations by comparing them with the best ones. This instrument is part of the flexible management techniques that are based on learning, on initiative, together with ABM, reengineering, value analysis, process performance tracking. P. Drucker (considered the founder of management principles) said that “there are few things that are as important for a company’s performance as measuring performance is”. It may be asserted that most current problems are caused by the management instruments that were created under economic and social conditions that are no longer applicable to the current economic context...|$|R
6000|$|... "Upwards of {{six years}} have now passed since Baron von Konigstein was {{appointed}} Minister to London from the Court of ----. Although apparently young for such an important mission, he had already distinguished himself as a diplomatist; {{and with all the}} advantages of brilliant talents, various accomplishments, rank, reputation, person, and a fascinating address, I need not tell you that he immediately became of consideration, even in the highest circles. Mr. Trevor, I was then just married, was at this period in office, and was constantly in personal communication with the Baron. They became intimate, and he was our constant guest. He had the reputation of being a man of pleasure. He was one for whose indiscretions there might be some excuse; nor had anything ever transpired which could induce us to believe that Baron von Konigstein could be guilty of anything but an indiscretion. At this period a relation and former ward of Mr. Trevor's, a young man of considerable fortune, and one whom we all fondly loved, resided in our family. We considered him as our brother. With this individual Baron von Konigstein formed a strong friendship; they were seldom apart. Our relation was not exempted from the failings of young men. He led a dissipated life; but he was very young; and as, unlike most relations, we never allowed any conduct on his part to banish him from our society, we trusted that the contrast which his own family afforded to his usual companions would in time render his habits less irregular. We had now known Baron von Konigstein for upwards of a year and a half, intimately. Nothing had transpired during this period to induce Mr. Trevor to alter the opinion which he had entertained of him from the first; he believed him to be a man of honour, and, in spite of a few imprudences, of principle. Whatever might have been my own opinion of him at this period, I had no reason to doubt the natural goodness of his disposition; and though I could not hope that he was one who would assist us in our plans for the reformation of Augustus, I still was not sorry to believe, that in the Baron he would at least find a companion very different from the unprincipled and selfish beings by whom he was too often surrounded. Something occurred at this time which placed Baron von Konigstein, according to his own <b>declaration,</b> under lasting <b>obligations</b> to myself. In the warmth of his heart he asked if there was any real and important service which he could do me. I took advantage of the moment to speak to him about our young friend; I detailed to him all our anxieties; he anticipated all my wishes, and promised to watch over him, to be his guardian, his friend, his real friend. Mr. Grey," [...] continued her Ladyship, [...] "I struggle to restrain my feelings; but the recollections of this period of my life are so painful that for a moment I must stop to recover myself." ...|$|R
