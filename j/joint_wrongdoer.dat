50|$|Similarly, joint wrongdoers are jointly and {{severally}} liable for the loss they have caused. A plaintiff may sue one or all of them. Where an award is made against one <b>joint</b> <b>wrongdoer,</b> he may claim a contribution from the other joint wrongdoers according to the extent of their proportionate fault.|$|E
50|$|The court held, as to {{the first}} argument, on the facts, that, without the {{assistance}} of the CPA and the SAP, there could have been no removal of the squatters. The CPA and SAP had therefore been co-spoliators with the owners of the respective properties; as <b>joint</b> <b>wrongdoers,</b> they were liable.|$|R
50|$|The {{rationale}} {{underlying the}} grant of a mandament van spolie {{is that no}} person is entitled to take the law into his own hands. An applicant for a spoliation order need not, therefore, {{as part of his}} case, prove that the spoliator had acquired possession of the property. Co-spoliators are, as a matter of principle, liable as <b>joint</b> <b>wrongdoers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The actio legis Aquiliae was a penal {{action with}} the {{ordinary}} consequence {{that it did}} not lie against the heres, except to the extent of his enrichment, that it was not extinguished by capitis deminutio, and that each of <b>joint</b> <b>wrongdoers</b> was liable in full. It was penal as to the whole of the damages and not merely as to the excess over the harm done, and as there often would be no such excess, it might, like the actio doli, be penal where what was paid was merely compensation. It was penal also {{in the sense that it}} was for double damages in case of denial, but this alone did not cause an action to be regarded as penal. The rule that it was duplex contra infitiantem, a result of the original manus iniectio, raises the question whether denial was of the facts or of liability. We are told that one who confesses the fact of killing could not afterwards deny liability, but might prove that the man was not dead, or died from natural causes. The text describes the action in which he has confessed the fact as confessoria.|$|R
