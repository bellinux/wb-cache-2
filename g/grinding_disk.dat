40|$|The article {{deals with}} the problem of {{stationary}} provision of grinding surface by creating the uniform abrasive impact on it. Mechanisms of forming the non-uniform abrasive action on machined surface grinding with the periphery of a start disk have been defined. It was revealed that stationary breaking of micro and macro geometry of grinding surfaces basically occurs in the areas of input of <b>grinding</b> <b>disk</b> in contact with machined surface and output from it and in the areas of configuration changes of machined surface. On the basis of analysis of analytical expressions, a new construction of the <b>grinding</b> <b>disk</b> has been worked out. It was determined that uniform abrasive action on machined surface is being provided at grinding with varied grained disk, therefore high grinding efficiency. It is explained with the concentrating on the operating surface of anisomerous <b>grinding</b> <b>disk</b> of granularity, starting with rough and ending with thin, allows combining the elements of rough and smooth grinding in one processing step. ...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} was reported {{of a new}} attempt in the fabrication of an ultrafine abrasive tool for vertical spindle grinding. The principle of sol-gel was applied to granulate ultra-fine abrasives {{in order to reduce}} their aggregation. The granulated abrasives were then added to resin bonds, thereby forming ultra-fine abrasive <b>grinding</b> <b>disks.</b> Before <b>grinding,</b> the <b>disks</b> were dressed to expected flatness using a brazed diamond pad. The dressed <b>grinding</b> <b>disks</b> were then used to grind silicon wafers and natural granite. Both dressing and grinding were conducted on a high precision vertical spindle grinding machine. After grinding, the morphologies of the workpiece materials were examined. With regard to the different concerns for silicon wafers and granite, surface roughness was measured for the silicon wafers and gloss readings were measured for the granite surfaces. It was found that the brazed diamond abrasives could dress the <b>grinding</b> <b>disks</b> with high efficiency and satisfactory flatness. The new ultra-fine abrasive disks were found to be able to process silicon wafers and granite slabs to acceptable results...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In equine practice, teeth {{corrections}} {{by means}} of motorized grinding systems are standard procedure. The heat resulting from that treatment may cause irreparable damage to the dental pulp. It {{has been shown that}} a 5. 5 degreesC temperature rise may cause severe destruction in pulp cells. Hence, the capability to continuously form secondary dentine is lost, and may lead, due to equine-typical occlusal tooth abrasion, to an opening of the pulp cavity. To obtain reliable data on the intra-pulp increase in temperature during corrective treatments, equine cheek teeth (CT) were modified in a way (occlusal surface smoothed, apical parts detached, pulp horns standardized) that had been qualified in own former published studies. All parameters influencing the grinding process were standardized (force applied, initial temperatures, dimensions of pulp horns, positioning of <b>grinding</b> <b>disk,</b> rotational speed). During grinding experiments, imitating real dental treatments, the time span for an intra-pulp temperature increase of 5. 5 degreesC was determined. RESULTS: The minimum time recorded for an intra-pulp temperature increase of 5. 5 degreesC was 38 s in mandibular CT (buccal grinding, 12, 000 rpm) and 70 s in maxillary CT (flat occlusal grinding, 12, 000 rpm). The data obtained showed that doubling the rotational speed of the disk results in halving the time span after which the critical intra-pulp temperature increase in maxillary CT is reached. For mandibular CT, the time span even drops by two thirds. CONCLUSION: The use of standardized hypsodont CT enabled comparative studies of intra-pulp heating during the grinding of occlusal tooth surfaces using different tools and techniques. The anatomical structure of the natural vital hypsodont tooth must be kept in mind, so that {{the findings of this study}} do not create a deceptive sense of security with regard to the time-dependent heating of the native pulp...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{a robotic}} {{machining}} process, a light-weight cutter or grinder is usually held by an articulated robot arm. Material removal {{is achieved by}} the rotating cutting tool while the robot end effector ensures that the tool follows a programmed trajectory {{in order to work}} on complex curved surfaces or to access hard-to-reach areas. One typical application of such process is maintenance and repair work on hydropower equipment. This paper presents an experimental study of the dynamic characteristics of material removal in robotic grinding, which is unlike conventional grinding due to the lower structural stiffness of the tool-holder robot. The objective of the study is to explore the cyclic nature of this mechanical operation to provide the basis for future development of better process control strategies. Grinding tasks that minimize the number of iterations to converge to the target surface can be better planned based on a good understanding and modeling of the cyclic material removal mechanism. A single degree of freedom dynamic analysis of the process suggests that material removal is performed through high-frequency impacts that mainly last for {{only a small fraction of}} the <b>grinding</b> <b>disk</b> rotation period. To detect these discrete cutting events in practice, a grinder is equipped with a rotary encoder. The encoder's signal is acquired through the angular sampling technique. A running cyclic synchronous average is applied to the speed signal to remove its non-cyclic events. The measured instantaneous rotational frequency clearly indicates the impacting nature of the process and captures the transient response excited by these cyclic impacts. The technique also locates the angular positions of cutting impacts in revolution cycles. It is thus possible to draw conclusions about the cyclic nature of dynamic changes in impact-cutting behavior when grinding with a flexible robot. The dynamics of the impacting regime and transient responses to impact-cutting excitations captured synchronously using the angular sampling technique provide feedback that can be used to regulate the material removal process. The experimental results also make it possible to correlate the energy required to remove a chip of metal through impacting with the measured drop in angular speed during grinding...|$|E

40|$|The stacking-fault energy (SFE) is a composition- and temperature-dependent {{materials}} {{property that}} can greatly influence the deformation mechanisms of austenitic steels. A low SFE increases partial dislocation spacing {{and leads to}} reduced dislocation mobility via an impedance to cross slip. This reduction in dislocation mobility will induce the formation of twins during deformation. These substructures will create further barriers to dislocation glide causing high strain-hardening rates that inhibit local necking and result in total elongation-to-failure of up to 80 % [1]. The goal {{of this research is}} to determine the SFE experimentally for new Fe-Mn-Al-Si twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) steels in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the influence of this parameter on the relationship between structure and mechanical properties. Three Fe–XMn- 3 Al- 3 Si (X = 22, 25 and 28 wt%) alloys were induction melted, thermo-mechanically processed by hot and cold rolling, and recrystallized at 900 oC for 30 min.

40|$|An {{intelligent}} controller {{has the ability}} to analyse an unknown situation and to respond to it accordingly. Approximate dynamic programming, or reinforcement learning as it is more commonly known, in the form of Adaptive Critic Designs (ACDS), falls into this category (56).

In this chapter, the action dependent adaptive critic (ADAC) (47) is used and a suitable second-order training algorithm is presented to ensure fast convergence and stability. The performance of the training algorithm is first compared in simulation for the control of an inverted pendulum. The ADAC scheme is then applied to the control of an aluminium subtrate <b>disk</b> <b>grinding</b> process where the learning is based on actual industrial historical data.

40|$|Nowadays, {{the basic}} {{requirements}} of gear transmissions {{are not limited}} only to the more usual ones (like resistance, reliability …), but often include also good efficiency and low vibration and noise emissions. Supporting structures, gear macro and micro geometry and textures are the key-points {{in the design of}} a geared system that fulfil the latter two requirements. The expected results can be obtained only if the gears actually meet the design specifications: {{this is one of the}} main reasons for the improvement and the optimization of the finishing processes, like shaving and grinding. A great deal of work has been done on defining the gear tooth flank topology that minimizes gear transmission error and consequently its noise emission, but usually, the practical realization of this micro-geometry is not taken into account.
