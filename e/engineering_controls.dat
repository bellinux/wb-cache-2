Professional divers are generally legally obliged to carry out and formally record these measures, and though recreational divers are not legally required to do many of them, competent recreational divers, and particularly technical divers, generally perform them informally but routinely, and they {{are an important part}} of technical diver training. For example, a medical statement or examination for fitness, pre-dive site assessment and briefing, safety drills, thermal protection, equipment redundancy, alternative air source, buddy checks, buddy or team diving procedures, dive planning, underwater hand signals, and carrying first aid and oxygen administration equipment are all routinely part of technical diving.|$|E

25|$|The {{introduction}} of the class into service has not been without problems. Since June 2005, all active Armidales have undergone operating restrictions on two occasions, both due to water contamination of the main fuel systems. The first occurrence, in September 2006, led to the suspension of operations by the patrol boats for a month, and the <b>engineering</b> <b>controls</b> were redesigned. The problem occurred again in January 2007, and led to an 'operational pause' while Austal redesigned the fuel system, engineering procedures were altered, and fuel quality criteria were tightened. The five ships yet to be completed were fitted with the modified fuel system during construction, while the active ships were refitted {{over the course of}} 2007. As of December 2007, no further fuel problems have occurred.|$|E
2500|$|MDI is {{the least}} {{hazardous}} of the commonly available isocyanates but is not benign. [...] Its very low vapour pressure reduces its hazards during handling {{compared to the other}} major isocyanates (TDI, HDI). However, it, like the other isocyanates, is an allergen and sensitizer. [...] Persons developing sensitivity to isocyanates may have dangerous systemic reactions to extremely small exposures, including respiratory failure. [...] Handling MDI requires strict <b>engineering</b> <b>controls</b> and personal protective equipment. Compared to other organic cyanates, MDI has a relatively low human toxicity. [...] It is a potentially violently reactive material towards water and other nucleophiles.|$|E

50|$|<b>Engineering</b> <b>controls</b> is {{the third}} of {{five members of the}} {{hierarchy}} of hazard controls, which orders control strategies by their feasibility and effectiveness. <b>Engineering</b> <b>controls</b> are preferred over administrative controls and personal protective equipment (PPE) because they are designed to remove the hazard at the source, before it comes in contact with the worker. Well-designed <b>engineering</b> <b>controls</b> can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection. The initial cost of <b>engineering</b> <b>controls</b> can be higher than the cost of administrative controls or PPE, but over the longer term, operating costs are frequently lower, and in some instances, can provide a cost savings {{in other areas of the}} process.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Engineering</b> <b>controls</b> are {{strategies}} {{designed to}} protect workers from hazardous conditions by placing a barrier between the worker and the hazard or by removing a hazardous substance through air ventilation.

5000|$|<b>Engineering</b> <b>controls</b> are {{physical}} {{changes to the}} workplace that isolate workers from hazards by containing them in an enclosure, or removing contaminated air from the workplace through ventilation and filtering. They are used when hazardous substances and processes cannot be eliminated or replaced with less hazardous substitutes. The types of <b>engineering</b> <b>controls</b> optimal for each situation {{is influenced by the}} quantity and dustiness of the material as well as the duration of the task. Well-designed <b>engineering</b> <b>controls</b> are typically passive, in the sense of being independent of worker interactions, which reduces the potential for worker behavior to impact exposure levels. The initial cost of <b>engineering</b> <b>controls</b> can be higher than administrative controls or personal protective equipment, but the long-term operating costs are frequently lower and can sometimes provide cost savings {{in other areas of the}} process.|$|E
