40|$|In the species-rich {{overstorey}} {{of tropical}} and subtropical closed-forests (rainforests), {{a series of}} life-forms (emergent trees, canopy trees, subcanopy trees, mid-stratum trees and shrubs, interlaced with lianes) of increasing basal area, height and <b>foliage</b> attributes (<b>leaf</b> area, leaf specific weight and internode length) develop in equilibrium with aerodynamic fluxes (frictional, thermal, evaporative±atmospheric salinity) in the atmosphere as it flows turbulently over and through a plant community. In both closed-forest and open-forest communities in eastern Australia, the translocation of high-energy nitrogen and phosphorus compounds into developing leaves - during the driest season of the year - increases as soil water becomes more available in the climatic gradient from the subhumid to the per-humid zone. <b>Foliage</b> attributes (<b>leaf</b> area and leaf specific weight) of vertical shoots {{are determined by the}} rate of input of high-energy compounds into developing shoot apices. Increasing nutrient input in the transpiration stream results in a greater number of leaves (with similar leaf specific weights) on vertical <b>foliage</b> shoots. The <b>leaf</b> area index of the tree is thus enhanced and leads to increased biomass, basal area and height at maturity. In each life-form within a closed-forest, the size of the root system is allometrically related to aboveground attributes. The ability of the root system to explore available nitrogen and phosphorus stored in the surface soil thus determines the attributes of developing foliage shoots in each of these life-forms. Both leaf areas and leaf specific weights decrease from maxima in canopy trees to leaves of subcanopy and mid-stratum trees in the milder climate under the dense structure of per-humid rainforests. In contrast, in the open-structured, subhumid rainforests, although leaf areas decrease in the gradient from canopy to mid-stratum trees - all exposed to direct solar radiation - leaf specific weights increase as temperatures in the boundary layer around growth-apices increase. The production of nitrate ions in soil, exposed to solar radiation in gaps, increases the uptake of nitrogen into leaves of pioneer trees. Larger and thinner leaves, with higher foliar N:P ratios and nitrate reductase activity, result in and enable rapid regeneration of the rainforest...|$|R
30|$|In Egypt, {{eggplant}} (Solanum melongena L.), {{an important}} solanaceous vegetable crop, {{is known to}} be extremely susceptible to root-knot nematode infection (Abd-El gawad 2014). This can make the crop more susceptible to other wilt diseases such as bacterial wilt and fusarium wilt (Tharshani and Sivapalan 2009). Eggplant is affected by several diseases, which do not let the plants grow and yield to a best of genetic potential. Among various pathogens, fungi constitute an important group as they inflict damage to crop plant caused by Phytophthora spp., Macrophomina phaseolina, Fusarium spp., Pythium spp., Rhizoctonia spp., and Sclerotium rolfsii. Symptoms were dark greenish, water-soaked spots which often girdle the stem, causing plants to wilt and die. <b>Foliage</b> <b>leaf</b> spots are often water-soaked and irregularly shaped, later becoming light brown.

40|$|Five {{different}} regions of the first <b>foliage</b> <b>leaf</b> of etiolated barley seedlings were studied with respect to leaf growth, plastid growth and replication, differentiation of etioplasts, and conversion of etioplasts into chloroplasts upon illumination. Ultrastructural changes of the plastids were correlated with chlorophyll synthesis and development of photosynthetic activity as measured by 14 CO 2 incorporation and O 2 evolution. The first <b>foliage</b> <b>leaf</b> has greater linear growth {{over a longer period of}} time in the dark than in the light. Only the bottom two regions (4 and 5) are still growing in the 5 -day etiolated leaf. Region 4 grows by cell elongation, and region 5 grows by both cell division and elongation. Plastids in all five regions of the leaf are capable of enlarging when exposed to light. This is true both for the intact plant and for excised sections. Plastid replication occurs predominantly in the younger regions of the leaf (regions 3, 4, and 5). The amount of chlorophyll synthesized by {{different regions}} in the intact plant is significantly higher (3 - 40 times) than that made by excised sections. Ultrastructural changes occurring in each region when excised sections are illuminated were classified into five stages involving increased membrane synthesis and appression into grana, and these changes were correlated with the first appearance of photosynthetic activity. The earliest detectable photosynthetic activity occurs in region 1 after 2 hours of illumination when chloroplasts show only a few overlaps in the thylakoids. Plastids in younger regions of the leaf require up to 24 hours of light to form grana and develop photosynthetic activity. Plastids in each region of the leaf are in different stages of development when photosynthesis is initiated, indicating that development of photosynthetic activity is not strictly correlated with a certain stage of plastid development. Membrane appression is not indicative of photosynthetic activity since overlaps are formed in the dark, but it was always present when photosynthetic activity was detectable. Likewise, there does not appear to be any strict correlation between the presence of chlorophyll and membrane appression. These results show that the particular structural and functional correlations that can be made depend to a large degree on age of the tissue...|$|E
40|$|A {{putative}} virus-induced {{disease of}} pear (Pyrus pyrifolia var. Hengshen) showing symptoms of reduced size of <b>foliage</b> and <b>leaf</b> distortion {{was observed in}} orchards in central Taiwan in 2004. The sap of symptomatic leaf samples reacted positively to an antiserum against Apple stem grooving virus (ASGV). Two virus cultures, designated as TS 1 and TS 2, were isolated from symptomatic pears. Flexuous filamentous virions of similar to 12 x 600 nm were observed in symptomatic pear leaves and purified virus preparations. Results of back inoculation of pear seedlings with TS 1 revealed that ASGV was the causal agent of the disease. Sequence analyses of the cloned coat protein (CP) genes of TS 1 and TS 2 shared 88 - 92. 4 % nucleotide and 90. 7 - 97. 1 % amino acid identities {{with those of other}} ASGV isolates available in GenBank. The polyclonal antibody generated against ASGV TS 1 has been routinely used for the detection of the ASGV-infection in the imported pear scions for quarantine purpose via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs).
