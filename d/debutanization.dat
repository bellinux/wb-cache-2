The exergy analysis results indicate that the exergetic efficiencies of the demethanization and the <b>debutanization</b> sections are the lowest. On the other hand, the exergoeconomic analysis results indicate that the increase of the unit thermoeconomic cost of the compression section and the demethanization section are the highest. This study demonstrates that exergoeconomic analysis can provide extra information than exergy analysis and the results from exergoeconomic analysis provide cost-based information suggesting potential locations for process improvement. Key Words: exergoeconomic analysis, thermoeconomic analysis...|$|E
