5|$|The {{new regime}} {{was soon to}} {{discover}} that changes don't easily come about by legislative fiat. The part of the constitution that worked adequately was the experiment with indirect democracy. During {{the period in which}} the constitution was in force, the system of primary assemblies that elected delegates who voted for the respective organs of government worked efficiently, and kept the voters engaged. However, <b>exactly</b> <b>because</b> the Republic was a genuine democracy, other goals of the regime were less easy to attain. The elections often put people into office that were very much opposed to the unitary state that was now enshrined in the constitution, and to other innovations that it entailed, or in any case were of a conservative inclination.|$|E

25|$|The {{prevalence}} of mitempfindung {{is difficult to}} determine <b>exactly,</b> <b>because</b> many individuals would not be aware of having referred itch until the phenomenon is explained to them. Consequently, variability exists within the scientific literature as to the actual {{prevalence of}} referred itch in humans. Mittelmann (1920) has reported that 8 out of 9 people questioned experienced referred sensations. In 1973, Sterling reported that about half of 20 healthy individuals questioned had mitempfindung.|$|E

25|$|The Court’s {{decision}} to qualify speech protection in Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. (1968), aimed {{to create a}} balance that would resolve the tension between individual and public interest in the speech on one hand, and the public employer’s interest in efficient operation, on the other. Souter wrote that the need to balance these competing needs hardly disappears when the employee happens to speak on issues that his job requires him to address. As noted in Waters, supra, such an employee {{is likely to be}} intimately aware of the precise nature of the problem <b>exactly</b> <b>because</b> it falls within his duties.|$|E
25|$|Chapter Twelve and the Epilogue detail {{events of}} {{over two years}} past Rudin’s arrival at Dar’ya Mikhailovna’s estate. Lezhnev is happily married to Aleksandra. He arrives to give her news of Sergei’s {{engagement}} to Natasha, {{who is said to}} “seem contented”. Pigasov lives with Lezhnevs, and amuses Aleksandra as he used to amuse Dar’ya Mikhailovna. A conversation which follows happens to touch on Rudin, and as Pigasov begins to make fun of him, Lezhnev stops him. He then defends Rudin’s “genius” while saying that his problem is that he had no “character” in him. This, again, refers to the superfluous man’s inability to act. He then toasts Rudin. The chapter ends with the description of Rudin travelling aimlessly around Russia. In the Epilogue, Lezhnev happens by chance to meet Rudin at a hotel in a provincial town. Lezhnev invites Rudin to dine with him, and over the dinner Rudin relates to Lezhnev his attempts to “act” – to improve an estate belonging to his friend, to make a river navigable, to become a teacher. In all three of this attempts Rudin demonstrated inability to adapt to the circumstances of Nicholas I’s Russia, and subsequently failed, and was in the end banished to his estate. Lezhnev then appears to change his opinion of Rudin as inherently inactive, and says that Rudin failed <b>exactly</b> <b>because</b> he could never stop striving for truth. The Epilogue ends with Rudin’s death at the barricades during the French Revolution of 1848; even at death he is mistaken by two fleeing revolutionaries for a Pole.|$|E

[...] "Are you sure it was 08:00?" [...] Ryba pressed—"Are you sure it wasn't 08:02?" [...] The player replied that he wasn't: [...] "No. Maybe it was even 08:03.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Ultra Jump Egg, Urobuchi gave insight into his writing philosophy, stating that he believed the overarching plot of a story {{was more important than}} the characters within it. He indicated that he would first determine the actions and the ultimate fate of a character before even assigning it a name, and contrasted this with other writing methods which first focused on developing the characters and then creating a storyline for them to follow. He again defended his decision to have Mami die, claiming that this could actually have the converse effect of making her character even more memorable, saying, [...] "I think there are quite many characters who became immortal <b>exactly</b> <b>because</b> they died, like Caesar Zeppeli in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure or Raoh in Fist of the North Star. Precisely {{because of the way they}} died, they were able to live forever." ...|$|E
500|$|Ziad J. Asali, who {{considers}} Zionism [...] "the heir—albeit illegitimate—of the Crusader movement," [...] goes further and writes that Prawer [...] "recognized {{the extent of}} the similarity in the individual and social experience of Crusaders and Zionists. Rather than studying the comparison and denying its validity, he chose to study the Crusader's experience {{as if it were a}} historical model which could be completely analyzed and dissected in order to benefit from its experience and avoid its mistakes." [...] To Zionist author Yoram Hazony, however, it is <b>exactly</b> <b>because</b> of Prawer's readiness to draw the analogy that he considers him a subverter of Zionism and a progenitor of post-Zionist thought. David Ohana, a professor of history at Ben Gurion University who rejects the Zionist-Crusader analogy, writes that the subject has now become a litmus test for clarifying one's views on Zionism, with post-Zionists freely making the analogy and sympathizers with the Zionist viewpoint rejecting it.|$|E
500|$|Selena {{suggested}} {{the idea of}} writing and recording a track based on a story about her grandparents titled [...] "Amor Prohibido". She explained it to A.B. who began co-writing it with Astudillo and herself. The singer was inspired by love letters written by her grandmother who wrote about her experiences as a maid to a wealthy family and her infatuation with their son. Her grandmother was forbidden to formulate a relationship with him because of her social class and described it as [...] "forbidden love". Pérez wrote that during its recording session: here was a noticeable difference between her voice on [...] and [...] Entre a Mi Mundo, especially. I can't {{say that it was}} an improvement, <b>exactly,</b> <b>because</b> I always thought that Selena's voice sounded incredible. It's just that her voice was richer and more mature than before, and her singing was more emotional and powerful as a result. While recording the song, Selena had ad-libbed [...] "oh baby". Her brother believed that the recording would [...] "not have been the same if she had not added the 'oh baby' part." ...|$|E

500|$|Selena {{wanted to}} write and record a song based {{on the story of}} her grandparents, who fell in love despite their {{different}} social classes. The singer was inspired by love letters written by her grandmother who wrote about her experiences as a maid to a wealthy family and her infatuation with their son. Her grandmother was forbidden to formulate a relationship with him because of her social class and described it as a [...] "forbidden love". She suggested the idea to her brother and music producer A.B. Quintanilla, who began co-writing the track with her and Selena y Los Dinos backup vocalist Pete Astudillo. [...] "Amor Prohibido" [...] was recorded at a studio in San Antonio, Texas. Selena's husband, Chris Pérez wrote in his 2012 book about their relationship that during its recording session [...] "there was a noticeable difference between her voice on [...] and [...] Entre a Mi Mundo (1992), especially.

In response to a wave of criticism, Prager released another column on the topic on December 5, 2006, entitled [...] "A response to my many critics—and a solution".

The nth most common frequency will occur 1⁄n as often as the first. However, this cannot hold <b>exactly,</b> <b>because</b> items must occur an integer number of times; there cannot be 2.5 occurrences of a word.

These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity. Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were Richard Overton, John Wildman and John Goodwin, the Baptists Samuel Richardson and Thomas Collier and the Quakers Samuel Fisher and William Penn. Anglicans who argued against persecution were: John Locke, Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, James Harrington, Jeremy Taylor, [...] Henry More, John Tillotson and Gilbert Burnet.|$|E
