Appropriate <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> <b>competitiveness</b> were identified and calculated for the years 1996 to 2000. These indicators provide a baseline upon which <b>competitiveness</b> <b>of</b> Irish agriculture can be examined on a regular basis. Phase I of this project investigated alternative indicators for measuring the <b>competitiveness</b> <b>of</b> the agricultural and food sectors, which meet the requirements of the theory <b>of</b> <b>competitiveness</b> and for which relevant data could be collected on an annual basis. Profitability was selected as a measure of competitive performance and costs of production, value of output and partial productivity indicators were examined as possible sources (potential) of competitive performance. In addition to performance and potential, the competitive process is often referred to in studies <b>of</b> <b>competitiveness,</b> the mechanism whereby competitive potential is translated into competitive performance.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{investigates the}} extent of the mark-up of the South African manufac-turing sector, taking into account a number of {{characteristics}} of its component industries. We find significant mark-ups to be present in the South African manufacturing industry. In comparative terms, the mark-up is approximately twice that found for the US manufacturing sector. We find that industry concentration exerts a positive influence on the mark-up over marginal cost whilst an <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> <b>competitiveness</b> suggests that an increase in an industry’s competitiveness relative to other industries allows it to raise its mark-up. However, within-industry increases in competi-tiveness reduces the mark-up. We also analyze the impact of import and export penetration. Both import and export penetration serve to lower the mark-up. The impact of the business cycle on mark-up indicates that the mark-up is countercyclical. Finally, accounting for intermediate inputs significantly lowers the absolute size of the mark-up, controlling for the industry’s concentration ratio. However, relative to findings on the US manufacturing sectors, SA manufacturing mark-ups remain approximately twice as large...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the evolution of}} labour costs and taxes in Belgium and neighbouring countries. We try to clarify the common issues in the current debate concerning labour costs and labour demand in Belgium and neighbouring countries and investigate the influence of labour costs on employment by using macroeconomic OECD data. We conclude that the tax wedge in Belgium {{is one of the}} highest of all OECD countries. Labour costs in Belgium rose at a moderate tempo, but labour productivity evolved less favourably compared with neighbouring countries. Belgian unit labour costs, considered as an <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> <b>competitiveness,</b> evolved unfavourably. By using a dynamic error correction model we find a statistically significant but limited negative relation between labour costs and employment. A decrease in labour costs of 10 % results in an increase of employment of only 1. 3 %, which indicates a strongly inelastic labour demand. In contrast to studies based on microeconomic data, which find generally higher wage elasticities, {{on the basis of this}} study no decisive elements can be found to question the rationale of the current wage indexation mechanism. economic history; ECSC; European Integration; regional concentration...|$|E

The paper is basically divided into two parts. Firstly, it discusses that high world market share is an <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> <b>competitiveness</b> for the product. From United Nations statistics, it was identified that Hong Kong and the Interior of China were competitive in certain discrete clothing items and a trend was apparent in the production shift of labour intensive clothing items from Hong Kong to the Mainland as witnessed from 1987 - 1993. With the revised statistical classification system in clothing items released by United Nations, {{second part of the}} paper further investigates the broad clothing categories of knitted and woven garments from 1987 - 1998.

40|$|The {{real-world}} problem the research aims to address is the continuing highly seasonal, exponential electricity demand {{growth in the}} Greek islands that are unconnected to the national electricity grid over the past decades. This paper presents {{only part of the}} ongoing research. It specifically tests an early draft of the sub-model concerned with the interplay of an island’s tourism volume & attractiveness, local technological learningby-using effects and the dynamics of demand-side equipment diffusion. The general assumption is that a tourist chooses a basket of services received at the place visited, one of which is cooling comfort. Cooling-comfort eventually translates to installed cooling capacity and in effect electricity consumption. This paper examines the submodel which, based on a figure of cooling comfort per person, constructs an <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> <b>competitiveness</b> to similar destinations and relates the flow of tourists to it. Similarly, a cost comparison incorporating a learning curve between a conventional and an efficient variant of cooling equipment drives the installation stocks at any time and effectively alters the efficiency of the overall service across the island.

40|$|The {{competitiveness}} of public transport on {{example of the}} Pardubice Region Abstract This diploma thesis {{is devoted to the}} {{competitiveness of}} public transport in the municipalities of the Pardubice Region. Competitiveness is understood mainly in terms of the price difference between travel time and cost of public and individual car transport, and also in terms of the real demand in the municipalities, thus the share of commuting by public transport. Other parameters of mode choice, that is understood as the main <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> <b>competitiveness,</b> is the number of public transport lines and automobilization. The main objective of this work is to determine how public transportation depends on the other transport characteristics of municipalities. To select significant variables, multiple linear regression analysis was used. After that, geographically weighted regression was applied in order to explain the share of commuting from municipalities. Most data originate in public databases (The Register of vehicles of Department of Transport, population census, digital geographic databases ArcČR and CEDA) and web portals (OREDO, IDOS), part of the data was obtained within questionnaire survey in selected municipalities.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} unit {{labor costs}} (ulcs), i. e., {{the ratio of}} the wage rate to labor productivity, as the <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> <b>competitiveness</b> in the Philippines. It is shown that ulcs have an interpretation {{from the point of view}} of the functional distribution of income (i. e., the distribution of output between labor and capital). The paper documents the dynamics of the labor share in national income for 1980 - 2002, and provides an analysis of the long-run performance of the Philippine economy. The most salient features are: (i) decreasing wage rate (until the mid- 1990 s) and labor share; (ii) stable profit rate and increasing capital share: (iii) stagnant capital-labor ratio; (iv) decreasing capital productivity; (v) decreasing labor productivity (until the mid- 1990 s); and (vi) increasing markup, the latter interpreted as an indicator of the firms' capacity to enforce a certain claim on profits against laborers and competitors, or as an index of the capacity of firms to exert anticompetitive practices. It is argued that these characteristics indicate that the country is submerged in a "low-level equilibrium trap. " This situation has profound implications for long-run growth and for the potential growth rate of the country, and explains the progressive deterioration of the Philippines during the last two decades, although some signs of recovery can be discerned...|$|E

The objectives of this study are: 1) producing a model of oligopoly market of hotel services based on marketing research; 2) synthesis of the conflict-optimum management method of a hotel complex using the model of oligopoly market of hotel services; 3) study of issues on competitiveness enhancement of running hotel complex in the market of oligopoly under counter-conditions of other hotel complexes. To obtain the result the paper offers to use techniques of classical and modern theory of management, namely methods of the theory of optimal management of multi-object multicriteria systems, methods of game theory, methods of system analysis, operations research and decision-making. The paper proposes a model of the oligopoly market for interaction of hotels in the hospitality services in Stackelberg’s form in which, as the "governing" parameters, a hotel complex has the accommodation cost in the selected category and the advertising cost. Monthly income of the hotel complex is proposed as an indicator of the efficiency. Evaluation of success in the market is based on the <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> <b>competitiveness.</b> To solve the problem of multi-criteria optimization the paper offers a method of conflictoptimum competitiveness management of hotel complexes. It considers a model example of the interaction between two complexes in the market of duopoly.

In the case of unsaturated demand (lack of customers) in the market there is no guaranteed solution, which is a prerequisite for entry into agreement between the market players. The model obtained can be useful for observing trends in the market of hotel services. </p...|$|E
40|$|Tourism {{has had an}} {{exceptionally}} long tradition in the Republic of Croatia. Therefore Croatia as such is not an unknown destination on the tourist map of the world. However, due to the globalization process and the increasingly strong competition in the tourist market, especially among the Mediterranean countries, several questions are raised: the question of competitiveness of the Croatian tourist product; {{as well as that}} of the competitiveness of Croatia as a tourist destination, and as an economy as a whole. The answer to the question why Croatian tourism does not achieve results proportional to its natural resource basis is to be sought at the company level. In fact, even though debate over achieving competitiveness and economic development is still frequently associated with the macroeconomic level, it is becoming increasingly clear that wealth and competitiveness are accumulated at the macroeconomic level of an economy. If we take into account that the main <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> <b>competitiveness</b> of a company is productivity, in a broad perspective it being the basis of GDP, i. e. the standard of living in a country, it is easy to deduce that the productivity of Croatian companies falls significantly behind that of their European counterparts, where an especially big discrepancy is noticeable in the area of small enterprise. Even though tourism is unconceivable without the existing natural and cultural attractions, modern research undoubtedly indicates that competitiveness is directly associated with advanced specialised factors based on knowledge, developed specialised infrastructure, high technology and innovation, with a natural correlation between innovative capacity of a company and its size. As those factors are frequently beyond the reach of small and medium enterprises, the question of making them more available is raised, with the purpose of increasing the competitiveness of a tourist product, namely service. Precisely for this reason, in a time when there is a need of adjusting to a new value system in the European tourist market, where knowledge and innovation are becoming the backbone of competitive advantage, the implementation of a clusterization model in the tourist market can have a positive impact on the increase of economic efficiency of small and medium enterprises gaining their maximum from the environment in which those companies operat...|$|E
