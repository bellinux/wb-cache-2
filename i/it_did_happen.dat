5|$|Neither the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle nor Æthelweard's Chronicon makes {{mention of}} Sitric {{in the years}} 921924, i.e. between his {{installation}} as King of Northubmria {{and the death of}} Edward the Elder. However, there are coins in existence which were minted at Lincoln during the period that bear Sitric's name. These are an important piece of evidence since they suggest Sitric ruled a large area south of the Humber, a claim contradicted by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle which says that all the 'Danes' in Mercia (i.e. south of the Humber) submitted to Edward in 918. These coins might indicate Viking reconquest of a large area in the years 921924, which if <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>happen</b> went unremarked upon by the Chronicle. Edward's control of Mercia likely stretched the kingdom's resources to breaking point, allowing Sitric to exploit the ill-will towards Edward that existed among the populace there, with Edward being unable to effectively oppose Sitric. Downham suggests that the silence of the Chronicle might be due to Edward's failing power in the latter years of his reign, and its tendency to only record successes and not failures. His death in 924 is not recorded by a number of important Frankish, Welsh and Irish annals, suggesting a fall in importance and standing from the zenith of his power in 920.|$|E

500|$|Historians {{disagree}} {{on where to}} assign responsibility for the Indian actions. Francis Jennings contends that Montcalm anticipated {{what was going to}} happen, deliberately ignored it when <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>happen,</b> and stepped in only after the atrocities were well under way. In his opinion, the account by Bougainville, who left for Montreal on the night of 9 August and was not present at the massacre, was written as a whitewash to protect Montcalm. [...] Parkman is more vigorous in his defence of Montcalm, claiming that he and other French officers did what they could to prevent atrocities, but were powerless to stop the onslaught.|$|E
500|$|Although King Henry doubtless {{intended}} to tie political opponents together, John's marriage to Elizabeth of York {{may have had}} the unintended consequence of tying Suffolk to York's future opposition of Henry. And, as Hicks says, Suffolk [...] "once again hazarded the future of his House" [...] by involvement in national politics. The year following their marriage, York's political opposition to Henry had become an armed campaign. Following their rout at Ludford Bridge in October 1459, Suffolk's brother-in-law and allies had been forced into exile and attainted at the Coventry parliament. Suffolk himself appears to have taken no part in York's military campaign, but according to one contemporary chronicler, at the same parliament, Suffolk was stripped of his dukedom and reduced {{to the rank of}} earl, because he had married a daughter of York. Official records continued to refer to John as duke, and in any case, as he was still strictly a minor, and not in official receipt of any of his titles, {{it may not have been}} true. Or, if <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>happen,</b> it may well have been on the grounds of his fiscal inability to uphold the status of a duke.|$|E
500|$|After {{arriving}} in The Hague, Nannerl developed a severe cold and {{was unable to}} participate in the initial concerts before the Princess during their first week, nor in a performance before the Prince a few days later. Leopold was sufficiently confident of Nannerl's recovery to announce the appearances of both prodigies at a concert to be given at the hall of the Oude Doelen on 30 September. The notice for this concert gives Wolfgang's age as eight (he was nine), but correctly gives Nannerl's as fourteen. The advertisement concentrates on Wolfgang: [...] "All the overtures will be from the hands of this young composer [...] Music-lovers may confront him with any music at will, and he will play it at sight". It is not certain whether this concert in fact took placeSadie believes it may have been postponed. If <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>happen,</b> Wolfgang appeared alone, for by this time Nannerl's cold had turned into typhoid fever. Her condition grew steadily worse, and on 21 October she was given the last sacrament. A visit from the royal physician turned the tide; he changed the treatment, {{and by the end of}} the month she was recovering. Then Wolfgang fell ill, and it was mid-December before he was on his feet again.|$|E
