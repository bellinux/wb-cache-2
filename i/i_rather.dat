He was extremely good company, with a sharp tongue and an inclination to dismiss most of humanity as spies and traitors. <b>I</b> <b>rather</b> liked that! I discovered he was very ambitious, perhaps more than his abilities warranted, and also very excitable. He sometimes worked himself up into such a state that he lost all powers of reasoning.|$|E

John Paul I had met Lúcia Santos while he was Patriarch of Venice, and was deeply moved by the experience. In a letter to a colleague after his election, he vowed to perform the Consecration of Russia which Lúcia said Mary had asked for.|$|E

25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War <b>I,</b> <b>rather</b> than face capture or destruction {{at the hands of}} the British Royal Navy, most of the Barbarossa-class ships were interned in neutral ports. König Albert and Moltke were interned at Genoa, while Blücher was interned at Pernambuco, Brazil. Five ships were interned at U.S.-controlled ports: four—Barbarossa, Friedrich der Grosse, Prinzess Irene, and Hamburg—were interned at Hoboken, New Jersey, and Princess Alice was interned at Cebu, Philippine Islands. Only Königin Luise and Bremen were in German ports, where they remained throughout the war. In September 1914, Hamburg was briefly renamed and chartered to the American Red Cross. Sailing under the name Red Cross, she made one roundtrip voyage to Europe before returning to New York, and her previous name.|$|E

In February 1952 the Military Board of the USSR Supreme Court sentenced him to 25 years' imprisonment. A decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in April 1952 reduced this sentence to 12 and a half years. A decree of December 1954 allowed him {{to be handed over}} to authorities of the German Democratic Republic, who allowed him to leave for West Germany in 1958. There he {{was arrested and charged with}} the illegal executions of German Army soldiers accused of desertion. He was found guilty and sentenced to four and a half years' jail, which he served. He was released in 1963 and lived in obscurity in Munich until his death in 1973. In the late 1960s he gave a lengthy interview to Italian historian Mario Silvestri that centered on his role and actions during the Austro-German victory at the battle of Caporetto in World War <b>I</b> <b>rather</b> than on his World War II service.|$|E
25|$|While at {{the time}} {{computer}} implementation was not an issue, this method suffers from the difficulty sketched above to convert from Lehmer code to permutation efficiently. This can be remedied by using a different bijective correspondence: after using d'i to select an element among i remaining elements of the sequence (for decreasing values of <b>i),</b> <b>rather</b> than removing the element and compacting the sequence by shifting down further elements one place, one swaps the element with the final remaining element. Thus the elements remaining for selection form a consecutive range at each point in time, {{even though they may}} not occur in the same order {{as they did in the}} original sequence. The mapping from sequence of integers to permutations is somewhat complicated, but it can be seen to produce each permutation in exactly one way, by an immediate induction. When the selected element happens to be the final remaining element, the swap operation can be omitted. This does not occur sufficiently often to warrant testing for the condition, but the final element must be included among the candidates of the selection, to guarantee that all permutations can be generated.|$|E

Informed of Maddy's strong fan base, Lewington commented: [...] "How lovely! I think it's because she's identifiable. People understand her motives and see that she has no hidden agenda.

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was largely positive. [...] "Miss Alli" [...] from Television Without Pity have the episode a positive review and rated it an A–.

500|$|After {{his brief}} stay in Pittsburgh, the Pirates sent Clarke to Greenville in 1920. He played next for Toledo and Winston-Salem, {{and then for}} the Reading Aces in the International League during the 1922 and 1923 seasons. In 1924, he played for both Reading and Harrisburg. [...] In 1925, he played for the Salisbury Indians in the Eastern Shore League. In the spring of 1925, The Sporting News wrote: [...] "Nig Clarke not only led the league with the bat and the mitt and the arm, he was the very picture of a {{baseball}} player. <b>I</b> <b>rather</b> suspect that Nig put away as much corn juice as the next man. In the days of his greatness he was wont {{to take a couple}} of snifters every morning before breakfast. Never seemed to hurt Nig any." [...] At the end of the season, he was given most valuable player honors for his performance with Salisbury. Clarke concluded his professional baseball career in 1927 with Tulsa.|$|E

500|$|During {{preparations}} [...] for {{the first}} German performance of Noye's Fludde in Ettal, planned for May 1959, {{the problem of the}} scarcity of handbells [...] became acute. Britten suggested that in the absence of handbells a set of tubular bells in E flat in groups of twos and threes could be played by four or six children with two hammers each to enable them to strike the chords. Britten was not present in Ettal, but he learned from Ernst Roth, of Boosey & Hawkes, that the Ettal production had substituted glockenspiel and metallophone for the handbells; according to Roth the bells in Carl Orff's Schulwerk percussion ensembles were [...] "too weak" [...] for the purpose. Britten later wrote to a friend: [...] "I am rather relieved that I wasn't there! – no church, no bugles, no handbells, no recorders – but they seem to have done it {{with a great deal of}} care all the same. Still <b>I</b> <b>rather</b> hanker after doing it in Darmstadt as we want it – even importing handbells for instance." ...|$|E
500|$|A third {{variation}} {{was written}} {{during the night}} of 21 February 1818. Schubert and Anselm Hüttenbrenner, a friend and fellow composer, had finished a few bottles of Hungarian wine when Anselm commented that his brother Josef was an aficionado of Schubert's work. Schubert completed a copy of [...] "" [...] that was [...] "somewhat messy". The messiness was partly accounted for by Schubert's drunken state, but also explained by the accompanying note he wrote to Josef: [...] "Just as, in my haste, I was going to send the thing, <b>I</b> <b>rather</b> sleepily took up the ink-well and poured it calmly over it. What a disaster!" [...] The manuscript was held by the Hüttenbrenner family {{for a number of}} years and was photographed in 1870, before being lost. Schubert wrote a further version in 1820 for publication in the Wiener Zeitung, and a final copy in October 1821 for publication in the Neue Ausgabe. The final version has [...] "a five-bar piano prelude" [...] and is presently in the Gertrude Clarke Whittall Foundation Collection of the Library of Congress.|$|E
500|$|In 1955 Larkin became University Librarian at the University of Hull, a post he held {{until his}} death. Professor R.L. Brett, who was {{chairman}} of the library committee that appointed him and a friend, wrote, [...] "At first I was impressed with the time he spent in his office, arriving early and leaving late. It was only later that I realised that his office was also his study where he spent hours on his private writing as well as the work of the library. Then he would return home and on a good many evenings start writing again." [...] For his first year he lodged in bedsits. In 1956, at the age of 34, he rented a self-contained flat on the top-floor of 32 Pearson Park, a three-storey red-brick house overlooking the park, previously the American Consulate. This, it seems, was the vantage point later commemorated in the poem High Windows. Of the city itself Larkin commented: [...] "I never thought about Hull until I was here. Having got here, it suits me in many ways. It is a little on the edge of things, I think even its natives would say that. <b>I</b> <b>rather</b> like being on the edge of things. One doesn't really go anywhere by design, you know, you put in for jobs and move about, you know, I've lived in other places." [...] In the post-war years, Hull University underwent significant expansion, as was typical of British universities during that period. When Larkin took up his appointment there, the plans for a new university library were already far advanced. He made a great effort in just a few months to familiarize himself with them before they were placed before the University Grants Committee; he suggested a number of emendations, some major and structural, all of which were adopted. It was built in two stages, and in 1967 it was named the Brynmor Jones Library after Sir Brynmor Jones, the university's vice-chancellor.|$|E
