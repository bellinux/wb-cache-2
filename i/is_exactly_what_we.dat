500|$|Grossmith had {{appeared}} in charity performances of Trial by Jury, where both Sullivan and Gilbert had seen him (indeed, Gilbert had directed one such performance, in which Grossmith played the judge), and Gilbert had earlier commented favourably on his performance in Tom Robertson's Society at the Gallery of Illustration. Sullivan mentioned to Arthur Cecil, the leading tenor from the Gallery of Illustration, {{that he was looking}} for someone to play the comic title role in his new comic opera, The Sorcerer. [...] Cecil reminded Sullivan about Grossmith, and Sullivan seized on the idea. After singing for Sullivan, upon meeting Gilbert, Grossmith wondered aloud if the role shouldn't be played by [...] "a fine man with a fine voice". [...] Gilbert replied, [...] "That <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> don't want." [...] Although Grossmith had reservations about cancelling his touring engagements and going into the [...] "wicked" [...] professional theatre (a move that might lose him church and other engagements in the future), and Richard D'Oyly Carte's backers objected to casting a sketch comedian in the central role of a comic opera, Grossmith was hired.|$|E
500|$|The video follows {{students}} at a dystopian-based correctional facility who rebel and take over the establishment, intertwined with shots of the band performing outside the prison in a cage, providing a [...] "soundtrack to the chaos." [...] Hoppus described their idea for the facility: [...] "It's kind {{of a combination of}} prep school and reform school, and it's very repressed and kids are being held down. There is a lot of authority and a lot of strict regiment, and the kids lash out and take over the school and destroy the place." [...] The band's main goal for the video was for it to resemble an art piece, much in the same way they viewed the production of the album, to keep in line with tone. To this end, they enlisted director David LaChapelle. LaChapelle's input—which [...] "ranges from an evil prison warden cracking a whip at marching school kids to escapees ripping their uniforms and doing acrobatic moves down the hallways"—was regarded by the band as [...] "completely wacked out and twisted, which <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> love." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1982 the Cure {{recorded}} and released Pornography, {{the third and}} final album of an [...] "oppressively dispirited" [...] trio that cemented the Cure's stature as purveyors of the emerging gothic rock genre. Smith has said that during the recording of Pornography he was [...] "undergoing a lot of mental stress. But {{it had nothing to do}} with the group, it just had to do with what I was like, my age and things. I think I got to my worst round about Pornography. Looking back and getting other people's opinions of what went on, I was a pretty monstrous sort of person at that time". Gallup described the album by saying, [...] "Nihilism took over [...] We sang 'It doesn't matter if we all die' and that <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> thought at the time." [...] Parry was concerned that the album did not have a hit song for radio play and instructed Smith and producer Phil Thornalley to polish the track [...] "The Hanging Garden" [...] for release as a single. Despite the concerns about the album's uncommercial sound, Pornography became the band's first UK Top 10 album, charting at number eight. The release of Pornography was followed by the Fourteen Explicit Moments tour, where the band finally dropped the anti-image angle and first adopted their signature look of big, towering hair and smeared lipstick on their faces. The tour also saw a series of incidents that prompted Simon Gallup to leave the Cure at the tour's conclusion. Gallup and Smith did not talk to each other for eighteen months following his departure.|$|E

[...] This <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> would expect for a transverse spin-0 wave; the behavior of analogous families of test particles which encounter a gravitational plane wave in general relativity is quite different, because these are spin-2 waves. [...] This {{is due to the}} fact that Nordström's theory of gravitation is a scalar theory, whereas Einstein's theory of gravitation (general relativity) is a tensor theory. [...] On the other hand, gravitational waves in both theories are transverse waves. [...] Electromagnetic plane waves are of course also transverse. [...] The tidal tensor ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 24, 1989, Rose voluntarily {{accepted}} a permanent place on baseball's ineligible list. Rose accepted {{that there was}} a factual reason for the ban; in return, Major League Baseball agreed to make no formal finding with regard to the gambling allegations. According to baseball's rules, Rose could apply for reinstatement in one year but Bart Giamatti said, [...] "There is absolutely no deal for reinstatement. That <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> did not agree to in terms of a fixed number of years." [...] Rose, with a 412–373 record, was replaced as Reds manager by Tommy Helms. Rose began therapy with a psychiatrist for treatment of a gambling addiction.|$|E
2500|$|The 1902 Constitution {{instituted a}} poll tax and {{required}} bulk payment after a voter missed elections, making voting a luxury that poor people, which included many African-Americans, could not often afford. The Constitution also required that voters pass a literacy test, a poll test on the Virginia Constitution, with their performance graded by the registrar. When questioned {{as to whether}} these measures were potentially discriminatory, Glass exclaimed, [...] "Discrimination! Why that <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> propose. To remove every negro voter who can be gotten rid of, legally, without materially impairing the numerical strength of the white electorate." [...] Indeed, the number of African-Americans qualified to vote dropped from 147,000 to 21,000 immediately. Carter Glass remained {{one of the strongest}} advocates of segregation and continued to dedicate much of his political career to the perpetuation of Jim Crow laws in the South.|$|E

2500|$|March – Apostle Holland {{addressed}} {{a question on}} homosexuality in the church's first [...] "face to face" [...] broadcast event for youth on March 8. Stated at around 1 hour and 13 minutes into the broadcast, the question referred to homosexual members who felt [...] "scared", [...] "alone", and like they didn't [...] "fit into the Lord's kingdom". Holland respond that the church does not [...] "make any attempt to say why ... or how [...] happened" [...] and that those with homosexual attractions have [...] "complexities in their makeup" [...] that we don't fully understand. He continued saying that what the church asks [...] "for those inclined to a homosexual feeling <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> ask for those with heterosexual feelings" [...] and {{that the church is}} not making them [...] "second-class citizens", later comparing them to women who never married.|$|E

As I said last night after the game, we have no control over the BCS; {{all we can do is}} go out there and play football. Which we did a good job of 10 times. That's something that they have to deal with and they dealt with it and they did the best they can do with they system. This is just how it is. Our players are really excited about going where we're going." [...] Vice President for ASU Athletics Lisa Love said.

30|$|Approaching {{the problem}} {{from the inside of}} the engine, FST focused on the {{internal}} irreversibilities: spatial non-uniformity of pressure, various frictions and throttling in valves. All these phenomena are related to the average speed of the engine’s piston. Evaluating these losses for each transformation and adding them, FST succeeds in providing an analytical formula for the engine’s power and efficiency, both as functions of the piston’s average speed. In [15], an analytical formula for the internal entropy source is provided, which seems to <b>be</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> looking for.|$|R
