25|$|During {{a search}} among Mrs McGinty's possessions, Poirot finds a {{newspaper}} from which an {{article has been}} cut out. The newspaper is dated {{a few days before}} the murder. He later discovers that the missing article is about women connected with famous murder cases, and includes photographs of them. He also discovers that Mrs McGinty had purchased a bottle of ink in a local shop shortly before her murder. He concludes that she had recognised one of the women in the article, and had written to the paper in question. Someone must have found out about it and then killed her to prevent her from talking. Poirot and Spence, using the ages of people in the town, conclude that someone is either Lily Gamboll, who committed murder with a meat cleaver as a child, or Eva Kane, who had been the love interest who inspired a man to murder his wife and bury her in a cellar. Another possibility <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> is Evelyn Hope, the daughter of Eva Kane. Shortly afterwards, Poirot discovers the murder weapon, a sugar hammer, left around in plain sight at his boarding house and accessible to all the suspects. In an attempt to flush out the murderer, Poirot claims to know more than he does and is nearly pushed under an oncoming train. Poirot decides to show most of the suspects the photos at a party. Mrs Upward claims to have seen the photo of Lily Gamboll, but does not say where.|$|E
500|$|The Info review concluded, [...] "Our {{only hope}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>someone,</b> somewhere, {{may be working}} (at this very moment) on ... MARBLE MADNESS II !!!" [...] An arcade sequel titled Marble Man: Marble Madness II was planned for release in 1991, though Cerny was uninvolved in the development. Development was led by Bob Flanagan who {{designed}} the game {{based on what he}} felt made Marble Madness a success in the home console market. Because the market's demographic was a younger audience, Flanagan wanted to make the sequel more accessible and introduced [...] "Marble Man", which expanded upon the gameplay of the original game. The design also included pinball mini-games between sets of levels and allowed up to three players to traverse isometric courses. Its final wave is called [...] "King of the Mountain". Flanagan intended to address the short length of the first game and, with the help of Mike Hally, developed seventeen courses.|$|E

500|$|Tucci {{was one of}} {{the last}} actors cast; he agreed to play Nigel only three days before {{shooting}} started. The filmmakers reportedly had auditioned Barney's creative director Simon Doonan and E!'s Robert Verdi, both openly gay men highly visible as media fashion commentators, for the part; the BBC's Graham Norton also auditioned. Verdi would later claim there was no intention to actually hire him and the producers had just used him and Doonan to give whoever they ultimately did cast some filmed research to use in playing a gay character (he would end up with a walk-on part as a fashion journalist in Paris). Tucci claims he was unaware of this: [...] "All I know <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> called me and I realized this was a great part." [...] He based the character on various people he was acquainted with, insisting on the glasses he ultimately wore. Daniel Sunjata had originally read for Tucci's part, rather unenthusiastically since he had just finished playing a similar character, but then read the Holt part and asked if he could audition for it. Simon Baker auditioned by sending a video of himself, wearing the same self-designed green jacket he has on when he and Andrea meet for the first time.|$|E
2500|$|There {{exists a}} legend of a ghost in Harbord- the myth {{surrounds}} the renovations {{the school has}} undergone, namely that of a boarded-up hallway. The idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> was bricked up inside the corridor, and now haunts the building. Witness accounts soon after completion of the renovations attest to hearing moaning and voices from behind the wall, though {{it has never been}} verified whether anyone has actually been trapped in the school walls. But then again, who would want to admit to murder? ...|$|E
2500|$|During the assault, {{a person}} will respond with fight, flight, freeze, friend (sometimes called fawn), or flop. Victims may react {{in ways they}} did not anticipate. After the rape, they may be uncomfortable/frustrated with and not {{understand}} their reactions. [...] Most victims respond by 'freezing up' or becoming compliant and cooperative during the rape. These are common survival responses of all mammals. This can cause confusion for others and the person assaulted. An assumption <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> being raped would call for help or struggle. A struggle would result in torn clothes or injuries.|$|E

2500|$|Charles Saatchi, who {{was best}} known as the most high-profile, high-spending {{collector}} of contemporary British art, bought My Bed (1998) for £150,000 ($248,000) from Lehmann Maupin's [...] "Every Part of Me's Bleeding," [...] the exhibition that won the artist a nomination for the 1999 Turner Prize. In 2013, on the occasion of a Christie's London sale that raised a total of 3.1million pounds ($5million) in aid of the Saatchi Gallery's policy of free entry, To Meet My Past (2002) sold for $778,900, establishing a new record for the artist. At another Christie's auction in 2014, My Bed was sold to White Cube founding director Jay Jopling for 2.5million pounds, including buyer's commission, once again to benefit the Saatchi Gallery's foundation. It was estimated that the price of My Bed would sell between 800,000 and 1.2 million pounds. Before the sale, Emin said that [...] "what I would really love <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> did buy it and they donated it to the Tate." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2015, Eno {{endorsed}} Jeremy Corbyn's {{campaign in}} the Labour Party leadership election. He said: [...] "I don't think electability really {{is the most important}} thing. What's important <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> changes the conversation and moves us off this small-minded agenda." [...] He wrote in The Guardian: [...] "By gathering this level of support Jeremy Corbyn has already shown that there is a strong nascent progressive movement in this country. He's shown the others in his party that there's a well of commitment for them to tap, if they have the will and the courage to do it. If nothing further happens with his campaign, that would be an undeniable and valuable contribution. I admit it: PM Corbyn is a long shot right now – but only four weeks ago bookies were giving 100-1 against him even becoming the candidate. Now it's 7-4 on. Things can change, and quickly. I think we should have some faith and give it a try." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{speculated that}} the killing of another Hmong individual, a 30-year-old man named Cha Vang, by James Nichols was {{influenced}} by the trial of Chai Vang. Cha Vang was shot with a shotgun, stabbed six times in the face and neck, and had his corpse hidden in the woods. Before killing Vang, Nichols made statements that Hmong people are [...] "mean", [...] "bad", and [...] "go for anything that moves". His employer testified that two months before the killing, Nichols mentioned that he would have killed a Hmong hunter that he had seen in the woods if he had been carrying a shotgun. On October 6, 2007, an all-white jury found Nichols guilty of a lesser charge of second degree intentional homicide and sentenced him to 60 years in prison. [...] "The message sent to the Hmong community <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> can shoot a Hmong hunter and not get the maximum sentence," [...] said Tou Ger Xiong, spokesman for the Coalition for Community Relations in St. Paul, Minnesota.|$|E

2500|$|He {{realizes that}} his {{co-workers}} at the factory, who he thought were his friends, only liked {{him to be}} around {{so that they could}} make fun of him. His new intelligence scares his co-workers, and they start a petition to have him fired, but when Charlie finds out about the petition, he quits. As Charlie's intelligence peaks, Algernon's suddenly declines—he loses his increased intelligence and mental age, and dies shortly afterward, to be buried in the back yard of Charlie's home. Charlie discovers that his intelligence increase is also only temporary. He starts to experiment to find out the cause of the flaw in the experiment, which he calls the [...] "Algernon–Gordon Effect". Just when he finishes his experiments, his intelligence begins to regress to its state prior to the operation. Charlie is aware of, and pained by what is happening to him as he loses his knowledge and his ability to read and write. He tries to get his old job as a janitor back, and tries to revert to normal, but he cannot stand the pity from his co-workers, landlady, and Ms. Kinnian. Charlie states he plans to [...] "go away" [...] from New York and move to a new place. His last wish <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> put flowers on Algernon's grave.|$|E
