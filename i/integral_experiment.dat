The parameters {{are the result}} of an analysis of experimental data available in the literature together with a parameter adjustment of transmission and capture data obtained at the time-of-flight facility GELINA. The parameters derived from the GELINA data are in good agreement with those quoted in the literature. From the analysis of the GELINA transmission data a thermal neutron total cross section equal to 2450 plus/minus 40 b has been deduced for natCd at 300 K. This value is in agreement with results of previous measurements which have been performed at thermal reactor beams using different techniques. However, it differs by about 1. 5 % from the value 2413 b which was recently deduced from an adjustment to results of an <b>integral</b> <b>experiment.</b> The GELINA transmission and capture data in the low energy region are also not consistent with resonance parameters recommended in evaluated data files.

40|$|Since {{the very}} beginning, the Phébus FP {{programme}} of <b>integral</b> <b>experiments</b> was {{considered as a}} necessary complement to the qualification “one by one” of physical models through analytical experiments, which has the disadvantage of introducing hypotheses e. g. on the additivity of phenomena and do not allow {{to be sure that}} no important phenomenon has been omitted. Also the physico-chemical nature of a number of species can best be determined in <b>integral</b> type of <b>experiments.</b> For all those purposes, a series of five in-pile <b>integral</b> <b>experiments</b> has been performed. The facility provided prototypic reactor conditions which allowed the study of basic phenomena governing core degradation through to the late phase (melt pool formation), hydrogen production, fission product (FP) release and transport, circuit and containment phenomena, and iodine chemistry. For each of these topics, key lessons have been learnt and are described. Amongst the most important, one can cite: 	The need to revisit cladding oxidation modelling, that impacts the hydrogen production kinetics, 	The fuel collapse (transition from rod-like geometry towards a molten pool) at temperatures far below what was expected, 	The fission product release from degrading fuel, 	The chemical form of fission products when transported in the Reactor Coolant System, especially for iodine and caesium, most important radionuclides, 	The in-containment behaviour of iodine especially the reactions between iodine and paints and the trapping of iodine by silver under certain conditions. From these findings, the physical models implemented in simulation tools used for safety studies have been improved. However <b>integral</b> <b>experiments</b> such as Phébus FP have often the disadvantage not to allow an accurate enough determination of the values of the parameters of physical models.

Only the GODIVA and JEZEBEL experimental results were used, in order to exploit information relative to the isotope of interest that are, in this particular case: {sup 235 }U and {sup 239 }Pu. The results obtained by the consistent data assimilation indicate that with reasonable modifications (mostly within the initial standard deviation) it is possible to eliminate the original large discrepancies on the K{sub eff} of the two critical configurations.

At present, the MCNP family of codes cannot explicitly model the D-T reaction for Deuterons in the KeV energy range.

40|$|A {{two-phase}} CFD modelling {{approach of}} the Pressurized Thermal Shock (PTS) problem has been developed and is being validated {{in the context of}} PWR life time safety studies. The cold water injection results in strong condensation and complex 3 D two-phase phenomena. Direct Contact Condensation (DCC) occurs on the jet and on the free surface of the stratified flow in the leg. These surfaces are much larger than the cells size used in the computational domain, in this sense they can be called large interfaces. DCC depends strongly on the liquid side heat transfer, which is modelled as a function of turbulence, which itself depends on momentum exchange between gas and liquid. A statistical model is used to represent turbulence in each phase. The large interfaces require a special modelling. It has been recently developed and implemented in the NEPTUNE_CFD code which is based on an Eulerian two-fluid model. The present status of this large interface modelling is presented. The validation relies on separate effects experiments such as air-water or steam-water stratified flows and on a more <b>integral</b> <b>experiment,</b> COSI, which represents a cold leg scaled 1 / 100 for volume and power from a PWR under SBLOCA conditions.

40|$|The {{detailed}} information on neutron source characteristics is important {{to meet the demand}} of research and applications on neutron activation and transport phenomena. Fast monoenergetic neutrons can be produced by two body reactions induced by accelerated particles.

The physical processes involved in the neutron generation were modelled by defining the SOURCE and SRCDX subroutines of the MCNP code. The properties of a neutron source from a D – T reaction were investigated, starting from the ENDF/B-VII nuclear data library for deuterons incident on a tritium target. The effects of the Titanium – Tritium atomic fraction, target thickness and deuteron energy on the source neutrons yields and energy were simulated. The angular and energy neutron distributions obtained from first principles were then applied to the MCNP 5 simulation of the tungsten <b>integral</b> <b>experiment</b> performed at the Japanese OKTAVIAN 14 MeV neutron facility.
