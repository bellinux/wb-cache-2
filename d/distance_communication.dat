Although short-distance calls may be handled from end-to-end as analog signals, increasingly telephone service providers are transparently converting the signals to digital signals for transmission. The {{advantage of this}} is that digitized voice data can travel side-by-side with data from the Internet and can be perfectly reproduced in long <b>distance</b> <b>communication</b> (as opposed to analog signals that are inevitably impacted by noise).|$|E

We first use interval data, combined with statistical information of RSSI values, to interpret the distribution characteristics of RSSI. We then use interval data hard clustering and soft clustering to overcome different levels of RSSI uncertainties, respectively. We have used real RSSI measurements to evaluate our <b>communication</b> <b>distance</b> estimation method in three representative wireless environments.

As the ratio between the two communication ranges becomes greater than half, a malicious covering algorithm that never provides long <b>distance,</b> multi-hop <b>communication</b> in the network, exists even if we constrain the base station to be placed at the vertices of a fixed grid-which is the typical scenario in the case of commercial networks...|$|R

2500|$|There was a {{great deal}} of {{interest}} in radio waves in the physics community, but the interest was in radio as a scientific phenomenon, not in its potential as a communication method. [...] Physicists generally looked on radio waves as an invisible form of light, a short range phenomenon which could only travel along a line of sight path, and thus its range was limited to the visual horizon like existing forms of visual signaling, making it unsuitable for long <b>distance</b> <b>communication.</b> Hertz's death in 1894 brought published reviews of his earlier discoveries including a demonstration on the transmission and detection of radio waves by the British physicist Oliver Lodge and an article about Hertz's work by Marconi's teacher, Augusto Righi.
