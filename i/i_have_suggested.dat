2500|$|After Sempill made an {{official}} protest, Churchill backtracked. The Prime Minister told the Admiralty: [...] "I had not contemplated Lord Sempill {{being required to}} resign his commission, but only to be employed elsewhere in the Admiralty." [...] A subsequent note from Churchill's aide Desmond Morton, dated 17 October 1941, outlined the new position: [...] "The First Sea Lord ... proposes to offer him a post in the North of Scotland. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> to Lord Swinton that MI5 should be informed in due course so they may take any precautions necessary." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{clinical}} grounds, {{patients who}} choose to use homeopathy in preference to normal medicine risk missing timely diagnosis and effective treatment, thereby worsening the outcomes of serious conditions. Critics of homeopathy have cited individual cases of patients of homeopathy failing to receive proper treatment for diseases {{that could have been}} easily diagnosed and managed with conventional medicine and who have died as a result, and the [...] "marketing practice" [...] of criticizing and downplaying the effectiveness of mainstream medicine. Homeopaths claim that use of conventional medicines will [...] "push the disease deeper" [...] and cause more serious conditions, a process referred to as [...] "suppression". Some homeopaths (particularly those who are non-physicians) advise their patients against immunization. Some homeopaths suggest that vaccines be replaced with homeopathic [...] "nosodes", created from biological materials such as pus, diseased tissue, bacilli from sputum or (in the case of [...] "bowel nosodes") faeces. While Hahnemann was opposed to such preparations, modern homeopaths often use them although {{there is no evidence to}} indicate they have any beneficial effects. Cases of homeopaths advising against the use of anti-malarial drugs have been identified. This puts visitors to the tropics who take this advice in severe danger, since homeopathic preparations are completely ineffective against the malaria parasite. Also, in one case in 2004, a homeopath instructed one of her patients to stop taking conventional medication for a heart condition, advising her on June 22, 2004 to [...] "Stop ALL medications including homeopathic", advising her on or around August 20 that she no longer needed to take her heart medication, and adding on August 23, [...] "She just cannot take ANY drugs – <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> some homeopathic remedies ... I feel confident that if she follows the advice she will regain her health." [...] The patient was admitted to hospital the next day, and died eight days later, the final diagnosis being [...] "acute heart failure due to treatment discontinuation".|$|E

60|$|He bowed, and {{it at once}} {{became clear}} that his {{business}} at Lavedan was--as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>suggested</b> to the Vicomtesse might be possible--with me alone.|$|R
6000|$|But <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>suggested</b> {{something}} else to my friend, who appeared for a moment detached. [...] "Should you say she'll hate her worse if she doesn't see?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lor', sir, you wouldn't have 'em {{in short}} clothes, poor little dears?" [...] And {{she said it}} {{in a tone that}} seemed to imply <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>suggested</b> some unmanly outrage.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will wait. If I {{can be of}} {{the least}} use to her,, send for me instantly. In the mean time don't forget to make the {{stipulation}} which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested.</b> It is the one certain way of putting your brother's real feeling in this matter to the test." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Madam," [...] he said, {{bowing to}} Mrs. Delaporte, [...] "Mr. Cheape and Captain Bannister, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> this conference because I believe in {{settling}} these affairs myself and not leaving everything to lawyers--no disrespect to present company. I {{have made an}} idiot of myself and I am ready to pay-- a certain amount." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{feel that}} you must fight this thing out with such weapons as you have?" [...] she asked. [...] "I suppose you wouldn't allow your friends {{to provide you with}} more {{efficient}} ones? I know <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> as much already, and you would not listen, but it would make success so much easier." ...|$|E
6000|$|And in January I {{was visited}} by Vasquez, who {{brought me a}} letter from the King, not, indeed, {{addressed}} to me and in the terms <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>suggested,</b> but to Vasquez himself, and it ran: ...|$|R
60|$|Some {{days before}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>suggested</b> to the {{commanding}} general that I thought {{if he would}} move the Army of the Mississippi at night, by {{the rear of the}} centre and right, ready to advance at daylight, Pope would find no natural obstacle in his front and, I believed, no serious artificial one. The ground, or works, occupied by our left could be held by a thin picket line, owing to the stream and swamp in front. To the right the troops would have a dry ridge to march over. I was silenced so quickly that I felt that possibly <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>suggested</b> an unmilitary movement.|$|R
60|$|She {{continued}} to stare at me in her amazement and the confusion that was congenital with it, {{and if there was}} not time for her to withdraw, at least the possibility <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>suggested</b> acted as a timely warning.|$|R
6000|$|... "My business--in this matter--is {{to carry}} out the wishes of the Council. They demand a {{volunteer}} cadet-corps. A volunteer cadet-corps will be furnished. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested,</b> however, that we need not embark upon the expense of uniforms till we are drilled. General Collinson is sending us fifty lethal weapons--cut-down Sniders, he calls them--all carefully plugged." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{accompanying}} notes <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that you}} vastly modify {{the first visit}} to hell, and leave out the second visit altogether. Nobody would, or ought to print those things. You are not advanced enough in literature to venture upon a matter requiring so much practice.

6000|$|... "I have, {{as you may}} believe, {{thought the}} matter deeply over, for it was evident {{to me that the}} news of my daughters' coming must have reached their assailants beforehand. I was most unwilling to suspect treachery on the part of any of my household, and came to the {{conclusion}} that the warning was given in the way <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then I took up my station {{near the}} stern, {{and in the}} gloom I could see the forms of my companions while they ranged {{themselves}} as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>suggested,</b> neither of them making more noise than so many mice.|$|R
6000|$|He looked {{thoughtful}} at that. [...] "I {{did think}} of it," [...] he says, [...] "and I know, jolly well, that if <b>I</b> <b>'ad</b> <b>suggested</b> it 'fore she'd found herself, she'd have agreed, but it don't seem quite fair now." ...|$|R
60|$|So now he {{set himself}} {{to work to}} build a {{scientific}} canoe. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>suggested</b> that we construct a dugout, but Perry convinced me that we must build something more in keeping with our positions of supermen {{in this world of}} the Stone Age.|$|R
60|$|Have {{the enemy}} called in any foreign help? If {{they have a}} foreign {{champion}} there I should {{have no objection to}} drive a nail in his track. I shall reach Chicago {{on the night of the}} 15th, to attend to a little business in court. Consider the things <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested,</b> and write me at Chicago. Especially write me whether Browning consents to visit you.|$|E
6000|$|... "A great deal, mother, yet I {{consider}} myself also a judge {{as to the}} wisest course to pursue. The plan which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> may clear up many things. It may bring to light the real object of this man. It may solve the mystery of that impostor, Wilmot. I am tired of all this uncertainty. We will have some daylight. I shall telegraph to-morrow morning to Scotland Yard." ...|$|E
60|$|What <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> hitherto, {{respecting}} {{the relations of}} Art to Religion, you must receive throughout as merely motive of thought; though you must have well seen that my own convictions were established finally {{on some of the}} points in question. But I must, in conclusion, tell you something that I know;--which, if you truly labour, you will one day know also; and which I trust some of you will believe, now.|$|E

3000|$|For the {{wireless}} standards HSDPA and Mobile WiMAX, the time-slot length for the downlink is 2 and 5 ms, respectively [1].

6000|$|No, as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested,</b> {{novelties}} {{are rare}} in the great capitals of modern times. Even the wool exchange in Melbourne could not be told from the familiar stock exchange of other countries. Wool brokers are just like stockbrokers; they all bounce from their seats and put up their hands and yell in unison--no stranger can tell what--and the president calmly says [...] "Sold to Smith & Co., threpence farthing--next!"--when probably {{nothing of the kind}} happened; for how should he know? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, you have," [...] said Mr Hazlit, again {{pulling out}} his purse and {{emptying}} its golden contents {{on the table}} in a little heap, from which he counted fifteen sovereigns. [...] "My debt to you amounts, I believe, to twenty pounds; five I have just paid to your landlord, here is the balance. You needn't mind a receipt. Send me the discharged account at your leisure, and think over what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested.</b> Aileen, my dear, we will go now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The things," [...] he said, [...] "which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> {{for your}} Majesty's consideration, harsh as they sound in your ear, are but {{substitutes}} for still more violent proposals brought {{forward in the}} Duke's counsels, by such as are more hostile to your Majesty. And I need scarce remind your Majesty, that the more direct and more violent suggestions find readiest acceptance with our master, who loves brief and dangerous measures better than those that are safe, {{but at the same}} time circuitous." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Had I {{been in her}} place," [...] {{said the}} Girton Girl, [...] "it {{would have been a}} {{separation}} <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> <b>suggested.</b> <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> hated him {{for the rest of my}} life." ...|$|R

This last kill took place at the entry point of pilgrims and in daylight.|$|R
