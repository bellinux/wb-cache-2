5000|$|In 1983, Halston {{signed a}} six-year {{licensing}} deal, worth a reported $1 billion, with the retail chain J. C. Penney. The line, called Halston III, consisted of affordable clothing, accessories, cosmetics and perfumes ranging from $24 to $200. At the time, {{the move was}} considered controversial, as no other high end <b>designer</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> licensed their designs to a mid-priced chain retail store. While Halston was excited about the deal and felt that it would only expand his brand, the deal damaged his image with high end fashion retailers who felt that his name had been [...] "cheapened". Bergdorf Goodman at the time dropped his Halston Limited line from their store shortly after plans for Halston III were announced. The Halston III line for J. C. Penney was poorly received and was eventually discontinued.|$|R
5000|$|Attempts {{to portray}} the Battle of Kursk. Some of the {{criticism}} levied at the user interface of the series has been addressed in this game: a fast AI option, avoiding some dialog boxes, and locating units by coordinates. The Wargamer review also analyzed the historical accuracy of the game. Although there are some discrepancies between various historian's accounts of this battle (in particular with respect to losses, see the article on the battle for details), the book of David Glantz and Jonathan House was taken as reference. The reviewer analyzed several scenarios in-detail, and concluded that [...] "with the exception of overrating Soviet air power early in the battle, this game is extremely accurate." [...] Rating the level of fun in the game, he found that [...] "scenarios with fewer than 40 turns and with relatively small numbers of units are engrossing", and suggested that players only try the larger ones afterwards. This recommendation was echoed by Computer Games Magazine. PC Gamer similarly found that [...] "firmly grounded on prodigious research, this game is surely the definitive Kursk simulation, {{and one of the}} finest titles this prolific <b>designer</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> given us." ...|$|R

Ellis got his start in golf course design under his father, who was the construction superintendent at Pinehurst Country Club for the construction of the first four courses. Ellis served in the U.S. Armed Forces during World War II, then in 1953 he opened his own golf course architectural firm. Ellis and his company went on to design over 70 courses in the Southeast region over the next thirty years, including Indian Valley Golf Course and Pinehurst #5.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 22 - 25, 1984 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaArtillery {{projectile}} <b>designers</b> <b>have</b> {{found an}} <b>ever</b> increasing need to soft recover prototype hardware and componentry in actual gun firings. Further, as projectile fuzes and guidance systems become more sophisticated, {{and with the}} increased use of telemetry and on-board memory systems, the soft recovery technique has become a necessity for the projectile development community. Described herein are parachute soft recovery techniques currently being used by the U. S. Army Armament Research and Development Center (ARDC), Large Caliber Weapon Systems Laboratory, Dover, NJ. In one parachute recovery system, the complete projectile body section is recovered. In another system, the nose-fuze/TM section is recovered. And in a third system, a jettisoned canister, housing electro-mechanical components, is recovered...|$|R
40|$|Programming {{languages}} often {{hide their}} implementation {{at a level}} of abstraction that is inaccessible to programmers. Decisions and tradeoffs made by the language designer at this level (single vs. multiple inheritance, mixins vs. Traits, dynamic dispatch vs. static case analysis, etc.) cannot be repaired easily by the programmer when they prove inconvenient or inadequate. The artificial distinction between implementation language and end-user language can be eliminated by implementing the language using only end-user objects and messages, making the implementation accessible for arbitrary modification by programmers. We show that three object types and five methods are sufficient to bootstrap an extensible object model and messaging semantics that are described entirely in terms of those same objects and messages. Raising the implementation to the programmers’ level lets them design and control their own implementation mechanisms in which to express concise solutions and frees the original language <b>designer</b> from <b>ever</b> <b>having</b> to say “I’m sorry”. 1...|$|R
