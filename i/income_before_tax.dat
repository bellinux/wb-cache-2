50|$|In the United States, the U.K. and elsewhere, {{companies}} {{are permitted to}} report one pre-tax income number (also called <b>income</b> <b>before</b> <b>tax,</b> profit before tax or earnings before income tax) to shareholders, and another, called taxable income, to the tax authorities. Differences between taxable income and the pre-tax income or profit number reported for financial statements are either temporary or permanent in nature. Permanent differences result when deductibility rules differ in perpetuity between accounting and tax law. Temporary differences result when the recognition of deductions for tax and accounting standards differ in their timing. The result is a gap between tax expense computed using <b>income</b> <b>before</b> <b>tax</b> and current tax payable computed using taxable income. This gap is known as deferred tax.

50|$|Based {{on the new}} one-rate {{tax regime}} {{introduced}} January 2011, the overall tax rate for all income-earnings bands has been 16%. According to the income-tax returns of 2008, 14,6% of taxpayers was charged for 64,5% of the total tax burdens. Before the new Corporate income tax regime, the Corporate tax was fixed at 16% of the positive rateable value, with an additional tax called solidarity tax of 4%, the measure of which {{is calculated based on}} the result before tax of the company (the solidarity tax has been in use since September, 2006).

50|$|In {{the long}} run, <b>income</b> <b>before</b> <b>tax</b> and taxable income {{will likely be}} more similar {{than they are in}} any given period. If the one is less in earlier years, then it will be greater in later years. Deferred taxes will reverse {{themselves}} in the long run and in total will zero out, unless there is something like a change in tax rates in the intervening period. A deferred tax payable results from a tax break in the early years and will reverse itself in later years; a deferred tax receivable results from more taxes being paid in early years than the tax expense reported to shareholders and will again reverse itself in later years. The deferred tax amount is computed by estimating the amount and the timing of the reversal and multiplying that by the appropriate tax rates.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the phrase}} income {{distribution}} covers {{a large number}} of different concepts, it is necessary to define these and to indicate the choice made in this article. Income for a given recipient may cover lists of items which are not always the same. Apart from popular misunderstandings about which items to include and exclude, statistical sources on incomes use varying definitions, often because of the data available. Tax statistics, which are among the most important sources for income data, sometimes exclude items because tax legislation contains allowances or includes items because of traditional concepts of income. The data from this source have been processed by a number of authors seeking to approximate the economic income concept, and it is assumed that this aim more or less has been attained. In other words, the article assumes that, in principle, the income figures used in the more sophisticated studies available cover the economic income concept and, more precisely, primary income, which is considered identical to <b>income</b> <b>before</b> <b>tax...</b>|$|E
