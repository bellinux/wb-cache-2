40|$|Series of {{measurements}} {{with single}} and multiple automated injection of a constant volume of 50 μl into the HGA 72 applying solutions with ppb amounts of Cu, Cd, and Pb and calibration curves had been performed. Further precision of automated injection is determined and compared with injection by hand using an <b>Eppendorf</b> <b>pipette.</b> After that {{the influence of}} HCl, HNO_ 3, and HCl 0 _ 4 at relatively low and elevated acid concentrations on signal height and reproducibility for 2, 5 ng Pb, memory effects for Pb, and Cd, and life time of graphite tubes with Cd and Pb had been studied.

30|$|All radiochemical {{evaluations}} {{were conducted}} using chemicals {{of the highest}} available purity grade. Volumes were measured using an <b>Eppendorf</b> <b>pipette.</b> A TiO 2 -based 68 Ge/ 68 Ga generator (Cyclotron Co., Obninsk, Russia) was used for all radiochemical evaluations. Four post-processing (PP) methods were used to purify and pre-concentrate the radioactive eluate: fractionation, acetone-, ethanol- and NaCl-based. Procedures were carried out, and solutions required prepared, as detailed in the relevant publication (Zhernosekov et al. 2007; Mueller et al. 2012; Eppard et al. 2014; Breeman et al. 2005). pH was measured using a Mettler-Toledo, SevenEasy pH. Radio-TLC was performed using silica- 60 TLC plates (Merck F 254, 4.5 [*]×[*] 4.5  cm), and eluted using 0.1  M citrate buffer (pH  4). Eluted radio-TLC plates were analysed using a flat-bed imaging scanner (Instant Imager, Canberra Packard).|$|E
40|$|The {{decontamination}} of polluted endodontic instruments is {{very difficult}} due to their complex geometry. Numerous {{studies have shown that}} reprocessed endodontic instruments are not always free from contamination. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a suitable reproducible method for soiling Hedstroem files, which were subsequently cleaned in different filled interim stands by different processing manners. Different solutions were examined concerning their regard to their cleaning ability when used in an interim stand: isopropanol alcohol 70 %, sodium hypochlorite 1 %, chlorhexidine gluconate 0, 2 % and 2 %, polyhexanide 0, 04 %, Endo CHX 2 % and physiological saline solution 0, 9 %. An interim stand remained unfilled as a control group. A total of 323 stainless steel plates and 259 Hedstroem files of different ISO sizes were investigated as specimens in this study. After developing the methodology, the stainless steel plates were replaced by Hedstroem files. Reactivated heparinized human blood was used as soiling solution. Trying to get this soiling solution on small ISO sized Hedstroem files (15 - 80) using <b>Eppendorf</b> <b>pipettes,</b> insulin injections or an immersion bath failed. Only by the use of Hedstroem files larger ISO sizes (120 - 140), the soiling solution could successfully be applied by using <b>Eppendorf</b> <b>pipettes.</b> The instruments were either stung different times by the foam disc (1, 3 and 5 times) of the interim stand or they remained for different times (30 s, 60 s and 300 s) in the filled interim stand. Depending on the filling of the interim stand (exeption were isopropanol alcohol and the unfilled interim stand), lower residual protein contaminations could be demonstrated with the modified OPA method the more often the Hedstrom files were stung by the foam disc or the longer the files remained in the filled interim stand. Alcohol may not be used for filling an interim stand prior to its fixing property, whereas the unfilled interim stand should not be used due to its lack of cleaning function. Since chlorhexidine gluconate and sodium hypochorite have a fixing property, they should also not be used. The cleaning performance of polyhexanide was not as good as that of the physiological saline solution. It should also not be used. In this study the lowest residual protein concentration was determined for the sterile, physiological saline solution. An interim stand which is filled with the right solution may ultimately increase the effectiveness and the success rate of root canal treatment...|$|R
30|$|Wettability {{studies on}} planar solid {{surfaces}} are usually conducted by direct contact angle observation. We applied this method to {{the observation of}} a macroscopic variation of the nanomaterial wettability. It was roughly estimated by measuring the static contact angles of sessile drops of deionized water (pH 5.5, resistivity > 17 MΩ cm). The plastic adjustable volume <b>pipette</b> (<b>Eppendorf</b> Research®pro, Germany) was used.|$|R
40|$|Development of an {{efficient}} cryopreservation technique for the domestic ferret is key {{for the long-term}} maintenance of valuable genetic specimens of this species and {{for the conservation of}} related endangered species. Unfortunately, current cryopreservation procedures, such as slow-rate freezing and vitrification with open pulled straws, are inefficient. In this report, we describe a pipette tip-based vitrification method that significantly improves the development of thawed ferret embryos following embryo transfer (ET). Ferret embryos at the morula (MR), compact morula (CM), and early blastocyst (EB) stages were vitrified using an <b>Eppendorf</b> microloader <b>pipette</b> tip as the chamber vessel.

30|$|For each resin {{composite}} material's extract, {{a standard}} analytical procedure was applied as follows: 500 μl of the composite saline extract {{was placed on}} the germanium prism (does not dissolve in water) using a 100 -μl <b>Eppendorf</b> Digital <b>Pipette</b> 4710 (<b>Eppendorf,</b> Hauppauge, NY, USA) and then placed under the fume hood until drying was complete; spectrum of the saline extract was then taken as is, after distilled water leaching, and after distilled water rinsing. The protocol for distilled water leaching was to apply distilled water until it covered the surface of the prism, leaving it for 15 s, and then spilling it, followed by air drying. For distilled water rinsing, distilled water was delivered from a squeeze bottle for 15 s by holding the prism about 20 cm away to produce a shear stress of approximately 1 Pa, and again air drying.|$|R
30|$|Ca, Na and Mg were {{determined}} by Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA). A 0.5  mL volume of sample was transferred with calibrated <b>Eppendorf</b> tip ejector <b>pipette</b> into pre-weighed 1.5  mL polyethylene vials {{with a piece of}} cotton, capped and heat-sealed to obtain a mass of 500  mg. The cotton wool was added as a safety measure to avoid the sample spilling and spreading radioactivity in case the vial opens in the reactor or while coming out of the reactor. Irradiations were performed using the Ghana Research Reactor- 1 (GHARR- 1) facility at Ghana Atomic Energy Commission, Kwabenya.|$|R
30|$|All assays were {{performed}} in standard multiwell plates to facilitate throughput and automation. Laboratory operations that involved manipulating liquids (e.g., inoculating suspended cells, dispensing media, diluting and distributing solutions of dissolved chemicals) and timed periods of incubation (e.g., overnight growth, media exchange, XTT conversion) were particularly amenable to automation. For this investigation, manual assays {{were performed}} with <b>Eppendorf</b> single barrel <b>pipettes,</b> while automated assays were performed using the Biomek FX automated liquid handler. Positive and negative control conditions were included on every antimicrobial activity assay plate (the plate layout {{is available in}} the Additional file 1 : Figure S 1). Data analysis and visualization were performed using R(R Core Team 2014) and several freely-available R packages: ggplot 2, reshape, beeswarm, ggplot 2 bdc, xlsx (Wickham 2007, 2009; Eklund 2013; Connelly 2014; Dragulescu 2014). All raw data and analysis code are publically available (Forry 2015).|$|R

The rate of in vitro development was significantly (P < 0. 05) higher among embryos vitrified at the CM (93. 6 %) and EB (100 %) stages relative to those vitrified at the MR stages (58. 7 %). No significant developmental differences were observed when comparing CM and EB vitrified embryos with nonvitrified control CM (100 %) and EB (100 %) embryos. In addition, few differences in the ultrastructure of intracellular lipid droplets or in microfilament structure were observed between control embryos and embryos vitrified at any developmental stage. Vitrified-thawed CM/EB embryos cultured for 2 or 16 h before ET resulted in live birth rates of 71. 3 % and 77. 4 %, respectively. These rates were not significantly different from the control live birth rate (79. 2 %). However, culture for 32 h (25 %) or 48 h (7. 8 %) after vitrification significantly reduced the rate of live births. These data indicate that the pipette chamber vitrification technique significantly improves the live birth rate of transferred ferret embryos relative to current state-of-the-art methods. ...|$|R
40|$|Cold and {{mechanical}} allodynia are important symptoms {{in patients with}} neuropathic pain. The study of cold allodynia in animals can help us to understand the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of neuropathic pain and to validate drugs. The evaluation of cold allodynia in gerbils with a chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve on the cold plate is not always stable. We developed a new application method of acetone using a specific spray technique with an <b>Eppendorf</b> (R) multistepper <b>pipette.</b> The chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve in gerbils resulted in a long-lasting mechanical and acetone spray-induced hyperreactivity throughout the testing period, which is clearly different from what was seen in sham-operated animals. The acetone spray test incorporates a multimodal stimulus different from direct cold stimulation. The reactivity to the acetone spray coincides in time and strength with the reactivity observed in mechanical allodynia in gerbils and with mechanical and thermal allodynia in other species. Furthermore, a pharmacological validation of the acetone spray test by different reference compounds was performed. Different compounds effective in neuropathic pain models in rodents influence the hyperreactivity to the acetone spray after acute and chronic administration. This study indicates that the multimodal acetone spray test is a valuable tool {{in the study of}} neuropathic pain in rodents. status: publishe...|$|R
