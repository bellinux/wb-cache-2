I mustn't belittle them too much, I think that they did stand up for academic freedom and so forth, but I don't think myself actually that they were sufficiently vigorous and the boycott helped to <b>knock</b> <b>sense</b> into their heads, to realise that they did have a role in seeking to undermine that vicious system apartheid." ...|$|R

50|$|Sold between October 2005 and April 2008 in {{sedan and}} utility body styles or as a wagon until June 2010, the BF series brought many {{mechanical}} upgrades, including {{but not limited}} to a raised compression ratio (10.3:1) and improved now-independent dual variable cam timing on the six-cylinder engines and improved <b>knock</b> <b>sensing</b> on the DOHC 3 Valve V8 which, in conjunction with ECU modifications, led to increases in power, torque and fuel economy, required to comply with recently introduced Euro III emissions standards. The changes to the six-cylinder engine further decreased the engine’s already low noise and vibration while increasing power from 182 to 190 kW (244 to 255 hp). With the BF, Ford introduced a six-speed automatic developed by German company ZF and Bosch. The XR6 Turbo got a power increase to , along with the ZF six-speed automatic.|$|E

The numbers of the cavalrymen slowly dwindle, with initial attacks killing off one soldier as well as the sergeant. One of the cavalrymen, Zimmerman, hatches a plan to escape with Kimbough, though Jennifer doesn't agree with the plan. Zimmerman is killed when he steals Lugo's gold and runs into the desert, where he is quickly shot. Lugo, however, hid his gold supply and Zimmerman only stole rocks.|$|R

6000|$|... "Just {{then another}} sea came aboard an' a'most <b>knocked</b> the <b>senses</b> out o' me. At {{the same moment}} I heard a {{tremendous}} crash, an' saw the mast go by the board. What happened after that I never could rightly understand. I grabbed at something--it felt like a bit of plank--and held on tight, you may be sure, for the cold had by that time got such a hold o' me that I knew if I let go I would go down like a stone. I had scarce got hold of it when I was seized round the neck by something behind me an' a'most choked.|$|R

6000|$|Fortunately Ranavalona did {{not think}} of {{connecting}} the flight of Rafaravavy with the recent entertainments, so that suspicion did not attach to Mark and his friends. Neither did the executioner with the Romanised nose suspect them, for in the profound darkness he {{had not been able to}} see who it was that <b>knocked</b> the <b>senses</b> out of him; and when afterwards he was told of the explosion that had occurred, he came to the conclusion, (and told his friends), that a big stone, hurled into the air at that time, had descended on his head and felled him. Whether the [...] "friends" [...] believed this or not we cannot say, but certain it is that they covertly rejoiced in the accident, for naturally the man of blood was no favourite! ...|$|R

Although Bart has several chances to disclose to Milhouse what happened during the race, Bart lets the opportunities slip, even at a town ceremony honoring his victory. However, when one of the bullies slingshots at Milhouse's forehead, the memories come rushing back, with Milhouse remembering how Bart just stood idly by as Milhouse suffered beating after beating.|$|R

5000|$|Yuki, guitarist {{and leader}} of the band. He's the one who steps up to {{management}} and let's them know what {{is in the best interest}} of Lucifer and his band mates. Santa's old friend (in the anime only) and one of the founders of the band, Yuki has the strongest sense of leadership and responsibility that naturally makes him the band leader. In the manga, Yuki is the actual founder of Lucifer since he scouted out Towa and Atsuro first from the band Bi-Jazz. ~see one shot on Towa and Vol. 10, Lucifer's Legend~ He is often the one who <b>knocks</b> <b>sense</b> into Sakuya (sometimes almost too literally) whenever Sakuya's primal feelings blind him to Aine’s own hurt and pain, and the exasperation he causes his band mates. Yuki is the eldest son of a famous, traditional Noh theater family, but was forced to choose between the band and his family when he tells his father he wants to quit Noh and concentrate on the band. He is subsequently disowned by his father, but a later episode of the series (anime only) reveals a friendly relationship between the two. Although he does go back to Noh theater after Lucifer officially disbands, Yuki's relationship with his parents is not mentioned in the manga after Marriage Phrase, Vol. 6. On a side note, Yuki is married to Maria and has a child. Their marriage was arranged because Maria's family was in Noh theater as well. She was in love with him but felt he treated her like a little sister. Eventually Maria found out about Lucifer and snuck out with him to watch the band practice. Yuki's tune changed when Sakuya started to come onto her. Maria supported his decision to be a guitarist in a band. However, when Yuki's father disowned him, he briefly divorced Maria because he wasn't certain he could take care of a wife at the time. He begged her to remarry him when the band signed their first contract. ~see Vol. 6 Marriage Phrase~ ...|$|R

He was upon Aftermath, the horse that Foley bought for five hundred pounds and was a colt then. Of course he left the field out of sight behind. He made for a gap in the park wall (faith! there was no lack of 'em), but the colt refused, and over went George and plumped into a cart of winter apples some farmer's sot was taking to Bury Saint Edmunds to market. The fall <b>knocked</b> the <b>sense</b> out of George, for he hasn't much, and Stavordale thinks he must have struck a stake as he went in. Anyway, the apples rolled over on top of him, and the {{drunkard}} on the seat never woke up, i' faith. And so they came to town.|$|R
40|$|Tulipped is a semi-autobiographical {{play that}} {{revolves}} around {{a young woman}} who is trapped in her fantasies and stuck in unfulfilling relationships. Her best friend intervenes and interrupts her life by staging a weekend intervention; hoping to <b>knock</b> some <b>sense</b> into her friend. The end result is an emotionally driven journey where the issues of choice vs. fate, nature vs. nurture, and forgiveness are discussed between the characters. The essay that follows offers a more in-depth discussion of the roots of maturation and healthy decision making skills and pays particular attention to the needs of children as they grow up. Connection to one’s past and the role of hindsight and reflection are also highlighted in great detail with regard to how they aid in integrating the pieces of oneself and assist in one’s ability to see the present world clearly in order to navigate the future successfully...|$|R
