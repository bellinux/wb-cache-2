5|$|It {{has long}} been {{suspected}} that pre-Columbian Mesoamericans used a toxic secretion produced by the cane toad as a hallucinogen, but more likely they used substances secreted by the Colorado River toad (Bufo alvarius). These contain bufotenin (5-MeO-DMT), a psychoactive compound {{that has been used}} in modern times as a recreational drug. Typically, the skin secretions are dried and then smoked. <b>Illicit</b> <b>drug</b> use by licking the skin of a toad has been reported in the media, but this may be an urban myth.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{typically}} transmitted through unprotected sex or intravenous drug use, {{and is often}} associated with groups such as promiscuous gay men, <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> users, and sex workers. For these reasons, and also because of fears of contagion, people living with HIV are frequently subjected to stigma and discrimination. Publicity campaigns around the world have aimed to counter HIV-related prejudices and misconceptions and to replace them with an accurate understanding that helps to prevent new infections. These efforts have been aided by various celebrities – including American basketball star Magic Johnson and South African judge Edwin Cameron – who have publicly announced that they are HIV-positive.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe use of <b>illicit</b> <b>drugs</b> {{and alcohol}} can affect body balance. AimTo {{evaluate}} balance control with static posturography in individuals addicted to <b>illicit</b> <b>drugs,</b> {{with or without}} alcohol abuse. Study design: Case-control, prospective. Methods 47 users of <b>illicit</b> <b>drugs,</b> with or without alcohol abuse, and a homogeneous control group consisting of 47 healthy individuals were submitted to a neurotological evaluation including Balance Rehabilitation Unit posturography. ResultsThe stability threshold mean values were significantly lower (p < 0. 0001) in users of <b>illicit</b> <b>drugs,</b> with or without alcohol abuse {{when compared to the}} control group; the mean values for sway velocity and ellipse area in all evaluated conditions were significantly higher (p < 0. 05) in the experimental group when compared to the control group, except for the ellipse area in static force surface and opened eyes (p = 0. 168).

5|$|The {{exact number}} of cases of {{rhabdomyolysis}} is difficult to establish, because different definitions have been used. In 1995, hospitals in the U.S. reported 26,000 cases of rhabdomyolysis. Up to 85% of people with major traumatic injuries will experience some degree of rhabdomyolysis. Of those with rhabdomyolysis, 10–50% develop acute kidney injury.

25|$|Related {{to their}} {{increased}} tendency for risk-taking, adolescents show impaired behavioral inhibition, including deficits in extinction learning. This {{has important implications}} for engaging in risky behavior such as unsafe sex or <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> use, as adolescents are less likely to inhibit actions that may have negative outcomes in the future. This phenomenon also has consequences for behavioral treatments based on the principle of extinction, such as cue exposure therapy for anxiety or drug addiction. It has been suggested that impaired inhibition, specifically extinction, may help to explain adolescent propensity to relapse to drug-seeking even following behavioral treatment for addiction.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the association between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and the use of alcohol, tobacco and <b>illicit</b> <b>drugs</b> among adolescents from a Brazilian cohort. The occurrence of five ACEs, the use of alcohol and tobacco and trying <b>illicit</b> <b>drugs</b> were investigated in the 1993 Pelotas birth cohort at the age of 15 (n = 4, 230). A score was created for the ACEs and their association with the use of substances was evaluated. Around 25 % of adolescents consumed alcohol, 6 % smoked and 2. 1 % reported having used drugs at least once in their lives. The ACEs were associated with the use of alcohol, tobacco and <b>illicit</b> <b>drugs.</b> A dose-response relation between the number of ACEs and the substance use was found, particularly with regard to <b>illicit</b> <b>drugs.</b> The occurrence of ACEs was positively associated with the use of alcohol, tobacco and <b>illicit</b> <b>drugs</b> among adolescents and the risk may be different for men and women.
