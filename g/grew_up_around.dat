5|$|Historically part of Lancashire, Eccles <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>around</b> the 13th century Parish Church of St Mary. Evidence of pre-historic human {{settlement}} {{has been discovered}} locally but the area was predominantly agricultural until the Industrial Revolution, when a textile industry {{was established in the}} town. The arrival of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the world's first passenger railway, led to the town's expansion along the route of the track linking those two cities.|$|E
5|$|Neville {{was born}} in England, {{and grew up in}} Manchester, England. He was later raised in Chicago, Illinois. He <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>around</b> artistic influences; his parents worked as {{performers}} in the circus. From an early age he was motivated to pursue a career in science fiction due to his appreciation for Star Wars. Page was inspired by makeup artist Rick Baker and his film work, including An American Werewolf in London.|$|E

5|$|While Glencross <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>around</b> {{the rodeo}} circuit, {{he did not}} enter into the sport until he met World Professional Chuckwagon Association driver Rae Croteau Jr. in 2005. He became {{interested}} in chuckwagon racing at the time, and while he does not race, Glencross {{was a part of}} Croteau's team in 2007 and 2008, helping around the stables.|$|E
5|$|After the Early Neolithic, {{the long}} barrow {{fell into a}} state of ruined dilapidation, with a small road being built through the centre of the {{monument}} by the 19th century at the latest. Local folklore <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>around</b> the site, associating it with the countless stones motif. The ruin attracted the interest of antiquarians in the early 18th century, and was studied by local archaeologists in the 20th. Both it and the nearby Chestnuts Long Barrow are open for public viewing by appointment with the landowner.|$|E
5|$|Irwin {{was born}} on his mother's {{birthday}} to Lyn and Bob Irwin in Essendon, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria. He was of Irish descent on his father's side. He moved with his parents as a child to Queensland in 1970, where he attended Landsborough State School and Caloundra State High School. Irwin described his father as a wildlife expert interested in herpetology, while his mother Lyn was a wildlife rehabilitator. After moving to Queensland, Bob and Lyn Irwin started the small Queensland Reptile and Fauna Park, where Steve <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>around</b> crocodiles and other reptiles.|$|E

5|$|Settlements <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>around</b> both castles on the Medina, but East Cowes Castle {{was rapidly}} {{abandoned}} and ultimately destroyed by coastal erosion; as a result, today West Cowes Castle is often simply {{referred to as}} Cowes Castle. Inspections in 1547 showed that there were 17 iron and brass artillery pieces at the fort, but that nine of these were inoperable; nonetheless it continued in use as a fortification after the original invasion scare had ended, staffed with a garrison of a captain, porter and three gunners during Queen Elizabeth's reign.|$|E
5|$|The town <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>around</b> Cor Tewdws, {{a monastery}} and divinity school, {{alternately}} named Caerworgorn, or Bangor Tewdws (College of Theodosius), or later Bangor Illtyd ("Illtyd's college"). Saint David, Saint Samson, Saint Paul Aurelian, Saint Gildas, Saint Tudwal, Saint Baglan and king Maelgwn Gwynedd {{are said to}} have studied at the divinity school. Cor Tewdws was destroyed in AD 446 and re-founded in AD 508 by St Illtyd as a centre of learning. The ruins of the school are in a garden {{on the north side of}} the churchyard; and the monastery was situated north of the tithe barn on Hill Head.|$|E
5|$|Wilfred Arthur {{was the son}} {{of stock}} {{inspector}} Stanley Oswald Darley Arthur from Goondiwindi, Queensland, a veteran of World WarI who had served overseas {{for the duration of the}} conflict. His mother, Helena Elizabeth Chaffers, was from the Isle of Wight, of Welsh descent. Born in Sydney on 7December 1919, Wilf <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>around</b> his father's home town near the New South Wales border. The boy's early education was by correspondence, but he later attended school at Yelarbon, Queensland, commuting on horseback. He then spent four-and-a-half years at The Scots College in Warwick, where he matriculated.|$|E

5|$|Iron Age hillforts {{testify to}} {{occupation}} of the area for thousands of years. The village <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>around</b> Dunster Castle which {{was built on the}} Tor by the Norman warrior William I de Moyon (d. post 1090) shortly after the Norman Conquest of 1066. The Castle is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. From that time it was the caput of the Feudal barony of Dunster. The Castle was remodelled on several occasions by the Luttrell family who were lords of the manor from the 14th to 20th centuries. The benedictine Dunster Priory was established in about 1100. The Priory Church of St George, dovecote and tithe barn are all relics from the Priory.|$|E
5|$|The castle was {{constructed}} on a limestone spur, overlooking {{the mouth of}} the Pennard Pill stream and Three Cliffs Bay, and was protected to the north and west by surrounding cliffs. The fortification initially took the form of an oval-shaped ringwork, , with a defensive ditch and ramparts around the outside, and a timber hall in the centre. A local church, St Mary's, was built just to the east and a settlement <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>around</b> the site; a rabbit warren was established in the nearby sand dunes. In the early 13th century, a simple stone hall, approximately , was built {{on the site of the}} older timber building, using red-purple sandstone with white limestone detailing.|$|E
5|$|The new {{territorial}} {{governor was}} sworn in on June 11, 1809. At first Edwards tried to avoid partisanship but soon found that faction was an inevitable result of his power to appoint officials and distribute government jobs. Although the First Party System continued to define national politics, the Federalist and Republican Parties never took hold in frontier Illinois. Rather, factional loyalties were created by personality, personal bonds such as kinship and militia service, and especially the distribution of patronage. In the early territorial years, two rival factions <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>around</b> Edwards and Judge Jesse B. Thomas. These two factions formed Illinois' political landscape during its time as a territory and for its first several years of statehood.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the model}} by sinologist Karl August Wittfogel, the loess soils of Shaanxi made it {{possible}} for the Chinese to develop irrigated agriculture early on. Although this allowed them to expand into the lower reaches of the Yellow River valley, such extensive waterworks on an ever-increasing scale required collective labour, something that could only be managed by some form of bureaucracy. Thus the scholar-bureaucrats came to the fore {{to keep track of the}} income and expenses of the granaries. Walled cities <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>around</b> the granaries for reasons of defence along with ease of administration; they kept invaders out and ensured that citizens remained within. These cities combined to become feudal states, which eventually united to become an empire. Likewise, according to this model, walls not only enveloped cities as time went by, but also lined the borders of the feudal states and eventually the whole Chinese empire to provide protection against raids from the agrarian northern steppes.|$|E
5|$|After the two rivers merge, the Avon {{then turns}} south east {{away from the}} Cotswolds and then quickly south into the clay Dauntsey Vale, where it is joined by the River Marden, until it reaches the biggest town so far, Chippenham. The wide vale {{is now known as}} the Avon Vale, and the river flows on via Lacock to Melksham, then turns north-west through Bradford on Avon, where the centre of the town <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>around</b> the ford across the river Avon, hence the origin of the town's name ("Broad-Ford"). This was {{supplemented}} in Norman times by the stone bridge that still stands today. The Norman side is upstream, and has pointed arches; the newer side has curved arches. The Town Bridge and Chapel is a grade I listed building. It was originally a Packhorse bridge, but widened in the 17th century by rebuilding the western side. On the bridge stands a small building which was originally a chapel but later used as a town lock-up.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 17th century {{large numbers}} of Huguenot weavers arrived in the East End, {{settling}} to service an industry that <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>around</b> the new estate at Spitalfields, where master weavers were based. They brought with them a tradition of 'reading clubs', where books were read, often in public houses. The authorities were suspicious of immigrants meeting and in some ways they were right to be as these grew into workers' associations and political organisations. Towards the middle of the 18th century the silk industry fell into a decline – partly due to the introduction of printed calico cloth – and riots ensued. These 'Spitalfield Riots' of 1769 were actually centred to the east and were put down with considerable force, culminating in two men being hanged in front of the Salmon and Ball public house at Bethnal Green. One was John Doyle (an Irish weaver), the other John Valline (of Huguenot descent).|$|E

5|$|The {{last chapter}} {{of the body of}} the book – if Chapter 10 is {{considered}} more or less an epilogue – covers towns seen as part of the English landscape. Hoskins justifies this on the grounds that understanding towns brings pleasure. He describes in turn planned towns, the open-field town, and the market town. Towns were planned as early as Norman times, Abbot Baldwin planning Bury St Edmunds between 1066 and 1086; Stratford-on-Avon was laid out in 1196. Another burst of town planning came with the spa towns in the late 18th century, and of new industrial towns like Middlesbrough and Barrow-in-Furness in the mid 19th century. Open-field towns like Nottingham, Leicester, and Stamford grew naturally in their own open fields, but were trapped by pasture rights from growing in the 19th century, giving Nottingham slums, and Leicester a problem that it just managed to solve, growing across its fields: while Stamford stopped growing entirely, becoming fossilised as what Hoskins calls a museum piece of a beautiful 17th and 18th century town. Finally, the market towns like Marlborough <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>around</b> their often large and handsome market places, which are however of any number of shapes.|$|E
