40|$|The {{formation}} of gas hydrates {{have been known}} to cause serious problems with blockages in natural gas pipelines, wellbore and natural gas processing units. The offshore sector of the North Sea comes into focus owing to factors such as low temperature, high pressure because of deep water fields, great depth of the subsea environment and remote locations that are factors underlying the increased hydrate formation. Hydrates are formed in multiphase transport comprising gas, condensate and water. Produced water must be cleaned {{if it is to be}} re-injected into the formation, or discharged into the sea or other water bodies, hence due to potential recycling of the inhibitor. One of the main purposes of water treatment is to distinguish the previously injected thermodynamic <b>hydrate</b> <b>inhibitor</b> in Gas-Condensate production. The aim of the thesis is to conduct a simulation study to determine the distribution of various thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors and H 2 O, in water treatment, using a Distillation Column. The distribution of thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors between the three phases, Vapour, Liquid and Aqueous Phase was also studied. The software used to complete this task was Aspen Tech HYSYS.

Commercially available corrosion <b>inhibitors,</b> <b>hydrate</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> demulsifiers and foaming agents are injected in a form of single, multifunctional mixture through one liner which reduces injection costs. The paper presents the results of laboratory tests, which aim was to investigate synergism and antagonism in multifunctional mixture containing different commercially available surfactants, corrosion and <b>hydrate</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> Correlations between final product composition and performances such as liquid unloading efficiency, corrosion protection and pour point were studied. The described approach allows to adapt the tertiary mixture composition (foaming agent + corrosion <b>inhibitor</b> + <b>hydrates</b> <b>inhibitor)</b> to the current production conditions. The polarization behavior of electrodes in brines with and without mixture of additives has been studied by a cyclic voltammetric method. The addition of increasing concentrations of each chemicals causes the reduction in the corrosion current density.

40|$|Prevention of {{gas hydrate}} {{blockages}} {{is a major}} challenge posed to the petroleum industry because uncontrolled formation of hydrate may result in plugging of transport pipelines, causing considerable production loss and personnel safety hazard.

In this thesis, novel techniques have been developed for monitoring hydrate inhibition and detecting early signs of hydrate formation based on downstream sample analysis and online measurements. The main achievements of this study can be categorised as follow: 1. Hydrate Inhibition Monitoring Techniques: Three techniques, i. e. conductivity-velocity (C-V) technique, water activity technique and water content technique, have been developed for determining optimising inhibitor injection rates 2. Initial Hydrate Formation Detection Techniques: The main objective of detecting early signs of hydrate formation is to give the operators adequate time to prevent hydrate formation and start remediation actions.

Here gas hydrate can from and agglomerate into plugs, jeopardizing pipelines and process equipments. Therefore a variety of methods have been developed to inhibit gas hydrate formation, one of them being to utilize low dosage <b>hydrate</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> which consists of kinetic <b>hydrate</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and anti-agglomerants. Low dosage <b>hydrate</b> <b>inhibitors</b> are relatively expensive, and it is therefore important to determine effective concentrations in laboratory apparatuses. Test apparatuses and methods are numerous, and the majority are THF rigs, rocker rigs, autoclaves, pipe wheels and flow loops. Prior methods for assessing <b>hydrate</b> <b>inhibitors</b> performance concentration tend to suffer form not being repeatable in addition to be inconsistent. Thus there are always possible for new hydrate inhibition test methods and apparatuses. A prototype table top wheel was developed for testing low dosage <b>hydrate</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> It consisted of a wheel submerged in a water bath. Unique features of the table top wheel was its small size, the acrylic top disk and the mode of moving the liquid in the apparatus. A swirling circular motion made the liquid move based on the "Euler disk" mechanical movement, hence no pumps or internal equipment for propelling the liquid was utilized. Preliminary tests were conducted to approve the apparatus for future experimental work, by providing a gas hydrate formation method of a consistent manner. The result for the same anti-agglomerant range in both 1. 5 wt% NaCl solution and distilled water, obtained in the table top wheel was compared to the rocker rig RCS 20. This was done to confirm if this apparatus indeed could be used to rank inhibitors, thus a validation of the apparatus. It was confirmed that the table top wheel result for the same anti-agglomerant range in both 1. 5 wt% NaCl solution and distilled water had the same trend as the results from the rocker rig. The table top wheel was thereby validated and approved at least for this anti-agglomerant range. However, the concentration required for an adequate inhibition was higher in the table top wheel compared to the rocker rig, hence the table top wheel was a more conservative test apparatus than the rocker rig. Unfortunately the table top wheel could not be operated safely after 59 pressurized experiments, due to cracks in the acrylic top disk. This was a severely design flaws which must be sorted out for the apparatus to progress. However, as far as being a prototype the table top wheel approved to be adequate.

Kinetic <b>hydrate</b> <b>inhibitors</b> (KHIs) are one class of low dosage <b>hydrate</b> <b>inhibitors</b> (LDHIs) which are used to prevent hydrate plug in pipelines. They work by delaying gas hydrate formation by time periods dependent mainly on the subcooling (driving force) in the system. The effect of various parameters on different kinetic <b>hydrate</b> <b>inhibitors</b> (KHIs) has been examined with high pressure rocking cell equipment (RC 5 unit) in this thesis. Since no one has published a study to compare KHI performance between rocking rigs and autoclaves this has been investigated in this study. Constant slow cooling experiments were conducted until hydrate formation started (To value) and hydrate plug formation (Ta value) occurred. All the different apparatuses gave similar performance trends with high performance KHIs, but To was different with low performance chemicals. This may be due to the stochasticity of gas hydrate formation. The reproducibility of To and Ta values from RC 5 are as good as both autoclaves. The RC 5 experiment at constant cooling showed that the KHI efficiency increased when concentration dose was increased from 2500 ppm to 5000 ppm.
