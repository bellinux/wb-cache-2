500|$|At this time, as an {{adolescent}} in Los Angeles, bebop and the swing era big bands both attracted Farmer's attention. Decades later, he stated that, at that time, [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be in jazz. Two things decided me – {{the sound of}} a trumpet section in a big band and hearing a jam session". Farmer's trumpet influences in the 1940s were Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis and Fats Navarro, but, in his own words, [...] "then I heard Freddie Webster, and I loved his sound. I decided to work on sound because it seemed like most of the guys my age were just working on speed".|$|E

[...] Djawadi stated that he refrained from using the typical Lannister theme, [...] "The Rains of Castamere", {{in order to create}} more of a mystery. The piece also featured vocals by two young boys singing in unison, with Djawadi describing how he pieced all of the separate pieces of the music together by saying [...] "The boys I recorded completely separate. The strings I recorded all together. Even the solo instruments, I recorded them separately — the solo violins and solo cellists were recorded separately. The piano, I played.

During a performance in Hartford, Connecticut {{near the end of}} the Warped Tour, Eminem slipped on a puddle of liquid and fell ten feet down off the stage, cracking several ribs. He recalled that the stress of his newfound fame led him to drink excessively, and reflected, [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> slow it down. The fall was like a reminder."

One day in 1973, a state bureaucrat entered Milk's shop Castro Camera and informed him that he owed $100 as a deposit against state sales tax. Milk was incredulous and traded shouts with the man about the rights of business owners; after he complained for weeks at state offices, the deposit was reduced to $30. Milk fumed about government priorities when a teacher came into his store to borrow a projector because the equipment in the schools did not function.

500|$|Berry {{was famous}} for his {{attention}} to detail and preparation, which he used to overcome his physical limitations. Considered slow for a wide receiver, he ran the 40-yard dash in 4.8 seconds. Rather than speed, he was renowned for his precise pass patterns and sure hands; he rarely dropped passes, and he fumbled only once in his career. He would squeeze Silly Putty constantly to strengthen his hands. He and Unitas regularly worked after practice and developed the timing and knowledge of each other's abilities that made each more effective. The reason for this, according to Berry, was that the two did not think on the same wavelength. [...] "Every season we had {{to start all over}} on our timing, especially the long ball," [...] said Berry. [...] "He knew he had to release the ball when I was eighteen yards from scrimmage for me to receive it thirty-eight yards out. I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> make my break in those first eighteen yards and get free within 2.8 seconds." [...] He also relied on shifty moves, and by his count, he had 88 different moves to get open, all of which he practiced every week.|$|E
500|$|Many Simpsons {{staff members}} were fans of English comedian Ricky Gervais and his British comedy series The Office that he created and starred. In January 2004, The Simpsons creator Matt Groening called Gervais to congratulate {{him on his}} double Golden Globe win. During the phone call, Gervais was invited to lunch with Groening and {{executive}} producer Al Jean since they were big fans and wanted to meet him. At this lunch, he was offered a chance to appear in and write an episode of The Simpsons. Groening first asked Gervais for just a guest appearance, but {{came to the conclusion}} that he might be interested in writing an episode too. Gervais told The Independent that when he got the offer, [...] "well, I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say yes, but fear kicked in at exactly the same time." [...] He became the first person to be credited with simultaneously writing and guest-starring in an episode of The Simpsons. He was also the first Briton to write an episode for the show. As a big follower of The Simpsons, Gervais saw the experience as [...] "a dream come true." ...|$|E

She also played in the [...] "Elle et lui" [...] episode of an erotic French TV series called Série rose in 1991, where she appeared nude. In 1992, Cruz made her feature film debut at 18 as the lead female role in the comedy drama art house film, Jamón, jamón. In the film, she portrayed Silvia, {{a young woman who}} is expecting her first child with a man whose mother does not approve of the relationship and attempts to sabotage it by paying Javier Bardem's character to seduce her. People magazine noted that after Cruz appeared topless in the film, she became [...] "a major sex symbol". In an interview with the Los Angeles Daily News in 1999, Cruz commented that [...] "it was a great part, but...I wasn't really ready for the nudity. [...] But I have no regrets because I wanted to start working and it changed my life." [...] Charlie Rose of 60 Minutes noted that Cruz [...] "became an overnight sensation as much for her nude scenes as for her talent".

500|$|... "Creep" [...] has {{not only}} been covered, {{it has also been}} sampled and recreated by many hip-hop and R artists. Two of the notable ones were {{released}} on SoundCloud in 2013 and gained many attention from the public are Haitian-Canadian record producer Kaytranada's remix of the song called [...] "Kaytranada's Creepier Edition" [...] in January and GoldLink's own rap rendition in December. Later in July 2015, American singer-songwriter Eric Bellinger re-wrote and recorded {{a new version of the}} track for his album Cuffing Season. He simply called his version [...] "Creep" [...] and invited Watkins to contribute vocals for a new verse. [...] "When I heard [...] flip I immediately <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> at least try to get T-Boz on it since that was her solo song with !

In February 2016, singer Zendaya sampled the song for her single [...] "Something New" [...] with Chris Brown. [...] "Well the song, when I first heard it, already had that TLC sample in it.

After hearing a demo version of the track, she begged Iglesias to let her record the song, telling {{him that it was}} [...] "her song". Lopez, who was going through a divorce with Marc Anthony and the [...] "breakup of a family", felt as if the song had come to her at the [...] "perfect moment". According to Lopez, the period was devastating because family is very important to her. Lopez revealed: [...] "I had to turn that into something better"; she thought: [...] "I don't want to just survive it, I want to come out better than that." [...] Lopez didn't want to be [...] "the woman who stayed in bed for months". [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> get through it. I'd dance every day, I'd work out, I'd say a little prayer and I still wouldn't feel any better. Then I'd go to bed and get up the next day and do it all again. It was a process, and it very gradually got a little easier ... I had to do it for my kids. I had to get through it for them." [...] She re-wrote parts of the verses to better relate to her experiences. The song [...] "helped lift her out of the darkness" [...] and gave her hope again. Looking back on the song in December 2012, Lopez stated that: [...] "'Dance Again' became my anthem ... an expression of what I needed to do at that time in my life and for what I was taking on with [...] It was a beautiful metaphor that became my reality." ...|$|E

500|$|After scoring 114 not {{out in a}} club {{match against}} Riverside, Ponting became the {{youngest}} player to appear for Tasmania in a Sheffield Shield match, breaking Boon's record by 14 days. In November 1992, {{at the age of}} 17 years and 337 days, he batted at number four in the order against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. Despite scoring 56 in a 127-run partnership with Boon, he could not prevent defeat, scoring just four in Tasmania's second innings. In his first match in Tasmania—this time against New South Wales—Ponting contributed 32 and 18 in a draw, before scoring 25 against Western Australia in a narrow loss. His first match in Sydney also marked the debut of future Australian opening bowler Glenn McGrath. At {{the end of the first}} day's play, Tasmania were 6/200, and Ponting was the only player to resist, reaching 98 not out. He eventually reached three figures the next morning, having endured three rain breaks and 54 minutes in the nineties. The century made him the youngest Tasmanian to score a first-class century, at 18 years and 40 days, eclipsing Boon's record of 19 years and 356 days. The next day he spoke about the achievement: [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be patient and wait for it to come [...] I wasn't that nervous last night, but I was a bit nervous this morning." [...] Dismissed for 125 out of a total of 298, Ponting scored 17 boundaries in his five-and-a-half-hour stay at the crease. Coach Greg Shipperd was impressed in what he saw: [...] "It was an excellent innings, one of classical stroke play. The way he freely put together a good, solid innings, showed that his potential is being realised. It was an indication, for him, of what it's like to go the extra step." [...] These performances lead Ponting to his List A debut on 13 December against Victoria in Devonport. He struggled, however, scoring 22 from 45 balls in Tasmania's defeat. His form, nonetheless, remained strong in first-class cricket, scoring another half-century, Ponting scored back-to-back centuries against Western Australia in Perth, the nation's fastest wicket, thus becoming the youngest batsmen in Shield history to score two centuries in a match. After setting a goal of scoring 500 first-class runs in the season, Ponting finished with 781 runs at 48.81. But his form in List A games were not as strong, aggregating 99 at 33 in four matches. Still, Ponting hit an unbeaten 59 from 52 balls against a touring England A side in Hobart. After the season's end, still aged 18, Ponting played seven four-day games for the Australian Academy, scoring 484 runs at 96.70.|$|E
