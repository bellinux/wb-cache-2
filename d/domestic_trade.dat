There is no scientific evidence to support these beliefs. The use of tiger parts in pharmaceutical drugs in China is already banned, and the government has made some offences in connection with tiger poaching punishable by death. Furthermore, all trade in tiger parts is illegal under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora and a <b>domestic</b> <b>trade</b> ban has been in place in China since 1993.|$|E
5|$|The Song dynasty {{had one of}} {{the most}} prosperous and {{advanced}} economies in the medieval world. Song Chinese invested their funds in joint stock companies and in multiple sailing vessels at a time when monetary gain was assured from the vigorous overseas trade and <b>domestic</b> <b>trade</b> along the Grand Canal and Yangtze River. Prominent merchant families and private businesses were allowed to occupy industries that were not already government-operated monopolies. Both private and government-controlled industries met the needs of a growing Chinese population in the Song. Artisans and merchants formed guilds that the state had to deal with when assessing taxes, requisitioning goods, and setting standard workers' wages and prices on goods.|$|E
5|$|All pipes {{water supply}} in the state was managed by the Sabah State Water Department, an agency {{under the control of}} Sabah Ministry of Infrastructure Development. Operating with 73 water {{treatments}} plants, an average of 1.19billion litres of water are distributed daily to meet Sabahan residents demands. The coverage of water supply in major towns has reach 100% while in rural areas, the coverage still around 75% with total public pipes length up to 15,031 kilometres. The only water supply dam in the state is the Babagon Dam which holds 21,000 million litres of water. To meet the increase demands, another dam named as Kaiduan Dam was being proposed to be built although being met with protest from local villagers who living on the proposed site. Sabah has a natural gas demand of 350 mmscfd in 2013, which increase to 523 mmscfd in 2015. As Malaysia's liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) are much cheaper through the subsidy that was given by the federal government, it was found out in 2015 that around 20,000 LPG cylinders in Sabah east coast were smuggled by immigrants from neighbouring Indonesia and the southern Philippines in a monthly basis to their countries that leading to many Sabahans hard to retrieve enough supplies of LPG. As a counter-measure, the Malaysian Ministry of <b>Domestic</b> <b>Trade,</b> Co-operatives and Consumerism (MDTCAC) has temporarily cancelled all permits to sell gas cylinders into neighbouring countries with a new policy will be implemented to control such illegal activities.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relation}} between internationalization (firms cross-listing, issuing depositary receipts, or raising capital in international stock markets) and the trading activity of the remaining firms in domestic markets. Using a panel of 3, 000 firms from 55 emerging economies during 1989 - 2000, we find that internationalization is negatively related to the <b>trading</b> activity of <b>domestic</b> firms. We identify two channels. First, the trading of international firms migrates from domestic to international markets and this migration along with the reduction in <b>domestic</b> <b>trading</b> of international firms has negative spillover effects on <b>domestic</b> firm <b>trading</b> activity. Second, there is <b>trade</b> diversion within <b>domestic</b> markets as <b>trading</b> activity shifts out of domestic firms and into international firms...|$|R

5|$|The {{principal}} {{threats to}} cockatoos are habitat loss and the wildlife trade. All cockatoos {{are dependent on}} trees for nesting and are vulnerable to their loss; in addition many species have specialised habitat requirements or live on small islands and have naturally small ranges, making them vulnerable {{to the loss of}} these habitats. Cockatoos are popular as pets and the capture and trade has threatened some species; between 1983 and 1990, 66,654 recorded salmon-crested cockatoos were exported from Indonesia, a figure that does not include the number of birds caught for the <b>domestic</b> <b>trade</b> or that were exported illegally. The capture of many species has subsequently been banned but the trade continues illegally. Birds are put in crates or bamboo tubing and conveyed on boats out of Indonesia and the Philippines. Not only are the rare species smuggled out of Indonesia but also common and rare cockatoos alike are smuggled out of Australia; birds are sedated, covered in nylon stockings and packed into PVC tubing which is then placed in unaccompanied luggage on international flights. Mortality is significant (30%) and eggs, more easily hidden on the bodies of smugglers on flights, are increasingly smuggled instead. Trafficking is thought to be run by organised gangs, who also trade Australian species for overseas species such as macaws coming the other way.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{relative}} price of agricultural commodities versus that of industrial commodities is analyzed via <b>domestic</b> terms of <b>trade</b> during 1990 - 2009 when trade liberalization gained impetus in Turkey. The <b>domestic</b> terms of <b>trade</b> which are improved {{in favor of}} the agricultural commodities during 1990 - 1998 except 1994 which is acknowledged as an economic crises year are reversed against the agricultural commodities after 1998 and plummeted in 2001 economic crises. The <b>domestic</b> terms of <b>trade</b> which are improved during 2001 - 2004 are deteriorated against the agricultural commodities after 2004. In the paper, the factors that define the <b>domestic</b> terms of <b>trade</b> during 1990 - 2009 are estimated via Least Squares Method with quarterly data. The findings of the paper revealed that the <b>domestic</b> terms of <b>trade</b> in Turkey are defined by the market mechanisms like {{the relative}} prices of the previous year and the relative production of the current year. Although the <b>domestic</b> terms of <b>trade</b> is not improved {{in favor of the}} agricultural commodities during the examination period, it is evident that the trade liberalization affects the <b>domestic</b> terms of <b>trade</b> in favor of the agricultural commodities.

40|$|We explore {{two main}} questions. First, can two markets for a company’s shares coexist and, if so, what determines the {{distribution}} of trading volume across them? For firms cross-listed in the U. S. we find that in most cases U. S. trading is a significant fraction of total volume, and tends to be larger for companies based in countries that are geographically close, with low financial development and poor anti-insider trading protection. Moreover, the relative size of the U. S. market is larger if the company is small, volatile and high-tech. Second, we ask whether developing an active foreign market entails lower <b>domestic</b> <b>trading</b> activity. We find that for firms based in developed markets, the domestic turnover rate increases {{in the wake of}} cross-listing and remains permanently higher. In contrast, emerging market firms tend to experience a decrease in <b>domestic</b> <b>trading</b> activity. trading volume, cross-listing, flow-back...|$|R

25|$|The retail {{industry}} represents 12.8% of Morocco's GDP and 1.2m people – 13% {{of the total}} workforce – are employed in the sector. Organised retail, however, represents {{only a fraction of}} <b>domestic</b> <b>trade,</b> as shoppers rely on the country's 1151 souks, markets and approximately 700,000 independent groceries and shops. The rapid emergence of a middle class – around 30% of the population – combined with a young and increasingly urban population and a craving for international brands, is rapidly changing the ways Moroccans spend their money. Still average purchasing power remains low overall, forcing retailers to cater to a broad section of the population and to keep prices low. Despite the challenges, the retail sector has strong growth potential. The franchising segment will continue to grow, and while strong local brands are emerging, international brand names will continue to account for the biggest percentage increase in the sector's turnover. Changing consumption habits, increasing purchasing power and the growing number of tourists should boost the development of malls and luxury shopping. However, independent stores and markets should continue to account for most <b>domestic</b> <b>trade</b> in the foreseeable future.|$|E
