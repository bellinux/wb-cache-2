25|$|An older Sachs <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> kit ("Hydro Pull") allows {{to rebuild}} a regular Sachs bicycle <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> to {{hydraulic}} lever and action. A piston is added outside the drum instead of the bowden clamp. This solution is often seen on modified Long John cargo bikes, allowing a low friction lever pull front wheel brake action. After Sachs ceased production of this kit a similar solution is sometimes done by welding on a Magura piston to the drum cylinder lever. Welding was necessary because the Magura action is reverse {{to that of the}} Sachs kit.|$|E
25|$|Drum brakes {{are most}} common on utility {{bicycles}} in some countries, especially the Netherlands, {{and are also}} often found on freight bicycles and velomobiles. Older tandem bicycles often employed a rear <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> as a drag brake.|$|E
25|$|In {{vehicles}} with rear disc brakes, the parking brake either actuates the disc calipers (again, with much less force) {{or a small}} <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> housed within the hub assembly (the inner circumference of the disc is often used instead of a separate drum).|$|E
50|$|Enclosed <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> or a rear {{coaster brake}} are used on most European city bikes, rather than rim brakes. A bike with <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> is {{optimized}} for stopping in wet weather: in wet weather, <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> provide more stopping power and reliability than rim brakes; but in dry weather, less.|$|R
50|$|The {{front axle}} has {{suspension}} by transverse leaf springs. While Tatra 11 had <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> {{only on the}} rear wheels, Tatra 12 had <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> all around.|$|R
50|$|As {{the shoes}} in <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> wear, brakes {{required}} regular manual adjustment until {{the introduction of}} self-adjusting <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> in the 1950s. Drums are prone to brake fading with repeated use.|$|R
25|$|The American Crosley Hot Shot {{is often}} {{given credit for}} the first {{production}} disc brakes. For six months in 1950, Crosley built a car with these brakes, then returned to drum brakes. Lack of sufficient research caused reliability problems, such as sticking and corrosion, especially in regions using salt on winter roads. <b>Drum</b> <b>brake</b> conversions for Hot Shots were quite popular. The Crosley disc was a Goodyear development, a caliper type with ventilated disc, originally designed for aircraft applications.|$|E
25|$|The first {{motorcycles}} to use {{disc brakes}} were racing vehicles. MV Agusta {{was the first}} to offer a front disc brake motorcycle to the public on a small scale in 1965, on their relatively expensive 600 touring motorcycle, using a mechanical brake linkage. In 1969 Honda introduced the more affordable CB750, which had a single hydraulically-actuated front disc brake (and a rear <b>drum</b> <b>brake),</b> and which sold in huge numbers. Disc brakes are now common on motorcycles, mopeds and even mountain bikes.|$|E
25|$|The 1950 Crosley Hot Shot {{is often}} {{given credit for}} the first {{production}} disc brakes but the Chrysler Imperial Crown actually had them first as standard equipment {{at the beginning of}} the 1949 model year. The Crosley disc was a Goodyear development, a caliper type with ventilated rotor, originally designed for aircraft applications. Only the Hot Shot featured it. Lack of sufficient research caused enormous reliability problems, especially in regions requiring the use of salt on winter roads, such as sticking and corrosion. <b>Drum</b> <b>brake</b> conversion for Hot Shots was quite popular.|$|E
50|$|<b>Drum</b> <b>brakes</b> {{are used}} in most heavy duty trucks, some medium and light duty trucks, and few cars, dirt bikes, and ATVs. <b>Drum</b> <b>brakes</b> are often applied to the rear wheels {{since most of the}} {{stopping}} force is generated by the front brakes of the vehicle and therefore the heat generated in the rear is significantly less. <b>Drum</b> <b>brakes</b> allow simple incorporation of a parking brake.|$|R
50|$|Another {{disadvantage}} of <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> is their relative complexity. A person {{must have a}} general understanding of how <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> work and take simple steps to ensure the brakes are reassembled correctly when doing work on <b>drum</b> <b>brakes.</b> And, {{as a result of}} this increased complexity (compared to disc <b>brakes),</b> maintenance of <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> is generally more time-consuming. Also, the greater number of parts results in a greater number of failure modes compared to disc brakes. Springs can break from fatigue if not replaced along with worn brake shoes. And the drum and shoes can become damaged from scoring if various components (such as broken springs or self-adjusters) break and become loose inside the drum.|$|R
50|$|<b>Drum</b> <b>brakes</b> are {{heavier than}} rim brakes.|$|R
25|$|Drum brakes provide {{consistent}} braking in wet or dirty conditions {{since the}} mechanism is fully enclosed. They are usually heavier, more complicated, and often weaker than rim brakes, but they require less maintenance. Drum brakes do not adapt well to quick release axle fastening, and removing a <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> wheel requires the operator to disconnect the brake cable {{as well as}} the axle. They also require a torque arm which must be anchored to the frame or fork of the bicycle, and not all bicycles are constructed to accommodate such fastenings or tolerate their applied forces.|$|E
2500|$|A roller brake is a modular {{cable-operated}} <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> {{manufactured by}} Shimano {{for use on}} specially splined front and rear hubs. [...] Unlike a traditional <b>drum</b> <b>brake,</b> the Roller Brake can be easily removed from the hub. [...] Some models contain a torque-limiting device called a power modulator designed to {{make it difficult to}} skid the wheel. [...] In practice this can reduce its effectiveness on bicycles with adult-sized wheels.|$|E
2500|$|The typical {{drag brake}} {{has long been}} a <b>drum</b> <b>brake.</b> [...] The largest {{manufacturer}} of this type of brake is Arai, whose brakes are screwed onto hubs with conventional freewheel threading {{on the left side of}} the rear hub and operated via Bowden cables. As of 2011, the Arai <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> has been out of production for several years, with remaining stocks nearing depletion and used units commanding premium prices on internet auction sites.|$|E
50|$|<b>Drum</b> <b>brakes</b> {{first started}} to be fitted to {{motorcycles}} in the 1920's and the basic design continues {{to be used to}} this day. Originally used for braking both the front and rear wheels, <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> have largely been superseded by disc brakes or are used for rear-braking only.|$|R
50|$|Transmission <b>brakes</b> use <b>drum</b> <b>brakes,</b> {{rather than}} disc brakes, {{as they are}} {{intended}} as a static parking brake, rather than a high performance dynamic <b>brake.</b> <b>Drum</b> <b>brakes</b> allow simpler adjustment with cable-actuated hand lever mechanisms. The brake is mounted to the rear output shaft of the transfer box.|$|R
50|$|Early {{cast wheels}} were not easily {{compatible}} with <b>drum</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Bicycle {{drum brakes}} operate {{like those of}} a car, {{although}} the bicycle variety use cable rather than hydraulic actuation. [...] Two pads are pressed outward against the braking surface {{on the inside of the}} hub shell. [...] Shell inside diameters on a bicycle <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> are typically [...] [...] Drum brakes have been used on front hubs and hubs with both internal and external freewheels. [...] Both cable- and rod-operated <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> systems have been widely produced.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{the dirt}} tracker, {{it came with}} brakes: a rear disc brake, and in front, a Fontana four leading shoe <b>drum</b> <b>brake,</b> which is two twin leading drum brakes paired {{side by side in}} two drums. The XRTT is the final example of a {{competition}} motorcycle with drum brakes, superseded by disc brakes on all other racing bikes due to the excessive unsprung weight added by the very large <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> assembly. The official horsepower was never published, but estimates for the early 1972 engines were in the high [...] range, increasing to an estimated [...] or more by 2008.|$|E
2500|$|More recently, large-rotor {{disc brakes}} {{are being used}} as drag brakes. [...] DT-Swiss make an adapter to mate disc rotors with hubs {{threaded}} for the Arai <b>drum</b> <b>brake,</b> but this still leaves the problem of fitting the caliper.|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} {{production}} vehicles, light and medium duty trucks, and motor {{homes have been}} made with a separate <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> on the driveline; called a transmission brake. This has an advantage of being completely independent of other braking systems. [...] This is effective when there are multiple driving axles, all driven wheels are braked at once.|$|E

2500|$|First {{invented in}} 1898 by Willard M. Farrow, the [...] "coaster brake", {{also known as}} a [...] "back pedal brake" [...] or [...] "foot brake" [...] ("torpedo" [...] or [...] "contra" [...] in some countries, in Italy [...] "contropedale"), is a type of <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> {{integrated}} into the back hub with an internal freewheel. [...] Freewheeling functions as with other systems, but when back pedaled, the brake engages after a fraction of a revolution. The coaster brake can be found in both single-speed and internally geared hubs.|$|E

2500|$|For 1969, a new one-piece, full-width grille, new {{taillights}} {{and trim}} were featured. Standard engines were unchanged, although refinements in the Chrysler Clean Air System (formerly Clean Air Package) produced better operating economy from the 6-cylinder engines. Improved <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> self-adjusters, {{a more efficient}} power steering pump, and improvements to the optional Sure-Grip differential were also highlighted. [...] Starting with cars built on January 1, 1969, front seat headrests were now standard. 1969 Valiants did not have side marker lamps, they would return in 1970.|$|E
2500|$|Most <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> designs have {{at least}} one leading shoe, which gives a servo-effect. By contrast, a disc brake has no self-servo effect and its braking force is always {{proportional}} to the pressure placed on the brake pad by the braking system via any brake servo, braking pedal, or lever. This tends to give the driver better [...] "feel" [...] and helps to avoid impending lockup. Drums are also prone to [...] "bell mouthing" [...] and trap worn lining material within the assembly, both causes of various braking problems.|$|E
2500|$|The AC-6 is a [...] {{wing span}} {{development}} of the [...] span AC-5M, with longer, higher aspect ratio wings terminating in winglets. Like the AC-5, the AC-6 wing employs a Wortmann FX 60-157 airfoil. Assembly of the wing to the fuselage uses a cam pin and incorporates automatic hookups for the ailerons and air brakes. The landing gear is a retractable [...] tire monowheel gear suspended with a pneumatic-hydraulic shock absorber. The wheel has a lever and cable operated <b>drum</b> <b>brake.</b> The cockpit can accommodate pilots up to [...] in height. The canopy provides 300° field of view and is jettisonable.|$|E

50|$|The CM400 series {{includes}} only a speedometer {{and three}} indicator lights (neutral, oil pressure, high beam) with a tachometer for the C and T models. The E (economy) model had wire wheels and <b>drum</b> <b>brakes,</b> {{while the others}} had Comstar wheels and a front disk/rear <b>drum</b> <b>braking</b> setup.

50|$|The Leone was {{available}} with a four-speed manual transmission, a five-speed manual transmission, {{and also a}} three-speed automatic transmission beginning in 1975. Some early models had duo-servo <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> at the front, however, later models were equipped with disc brakes. All models originally had rear <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> except the RX coupés. Unusually, the handbrake or emergency brake operated on the front wheels.|$|R
