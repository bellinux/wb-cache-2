5|$|This is {{the first}} series to feature Matt Smith as the {{eleventh}} incarnation of the Doctor, an alien Time Lord who travels through time and space in his TARDIS, {{which appears to be}} a British police box on the outside. Karen Gillan is also introduced as the Doctor's new companion Amy Pond, with her fiancé Rory Williams portrayed by Arthur Darvill, who is in seven episodes, and travels with the Doctor and Amy and is also a regular in the next series. Alex Kingston returns as River Song, a mysterious woman from the Doctor's future who summons the Doctor twice in this series. The main story arc concerns a pattern of cracks in the universe which appear over several episodes, sometimes going unnoticed by the characters. It is discovered that they have the power to erase things from existence, and this happens to Rory, causing Amy to <b>forget</b> <b>him.</b> In the series finale it is revealed that the cracks were caused by the TARDIS exploding and the Doctor is forced to reboot the universe to the state which it was in without the cracks.|$|E

500|$|Whatever {{the true}} story of the {{rebellion}} on the ice, neither Worsley nor McNish ever mentioned the incident in writing. Shackleton omitted it entirely from South, his account of the expedition, and referred to it only tangentially in his diary: [...] "Everyone working well except the carpenter. I shall never <b>forget</b> <b>him</b> in this time of strain and stress". The event was recorded in the ship's log, but the log entry was struck during the sea voyage in the James Caird, Shackleton being impressed by the carpenter's show of [...] "grit and spirit". Nevertheless, McNish's name appeared on the list of the four men not recommended for the Polar Medal in the letter sent by Shackleton on his return. Macklin thought the denial of the medal unjustified: ...|$|E

500|$|According to Lo, [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] is {{the song}} from Truth Serum (2014) {{that means the}} most to her because of its honest lyrics and {{extended}} writing process.

Later, Lo's boyfriend became part of a Buddhist movement but she refused to join, which led the relationship to an end. After that, she started using drugs and drinking in order to <b>forget</b> <b>him.</b> Months after the relationship ended, she was staying at a friend's apartment in New York City, during 2012's Hurricane Sandy.

Newspaper {{commentary}} was limited; the first article about the case that The Times noted was only published around 19 November, in the Frankfurter Zeitung, in which a pseudonymous columnist suggested that the British might have been tempted to show Lody mercy: [...] "I myself am convinced that the noble manliness with which this strong German composure bore itself before the Court touched {{the heart of the}} Judge, that the Judge said [...] "If only we English had many such Hans Lodys!" [...] and that Hans Lody lives... We shall not <b>forget</b> <b>him,</b> for he staked his country more than his life – his name and his honour."

In [...] "Asylum of the Daleks", the Daleks' knowledge of the Doctor is tied to a psychic link among them called the path-web, which is hacked to make them <b>forget</b> <b>him.</b> The Cybermen have their own method of recognising the Doctor, usually through his past incarnations, as seen in Earthshock and [...] "The Next Doctor".|$|E

2500|$|There {{seems to}} be a couple {{different}} types of irony in the sonnets in general that which is [...] "openly voiced by the speaker and authorial irony suggested {{at the expense of the}} (deceived) speaker." [...] There seems to a sense of irony when the speaker tells the beloved to <b>forget</b> <b>him.</b> Schoenfeldt reasons that [...] "we cannot quite take these lines literally" [...] because [...] "to tell someone to forget something is to make it harder for them to forget." [...] This demonstrates a certain [...] "reverse-psychology appeal" [...] as a sense of irony. Furthermore [...] "the shift from the 'vile world' (line 4) to the 'wise world' (line 13) is the final evidence of Shakespeare's irony" [...] in this particular sonnet. Krieger goes on to explain: [...] "For this world is wise—that is, shrewd, prudential—only as it is vile, only as it exercises those characteristics which ape the destructive perfection, the absolute cooperation with time, of the 'vilest worms.'" [...] He questions, [...] "How single-mindedly, then, is his friend to take this selfless, seemingly anti-sentimental injunction to obey to obey the dictates of the world's cold wisdom lest he be mocked by it?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{contents}} of the house were sold by auction under a marquee outside the house over a five-day period 26 November– 1 December 1956.

In truth the collection included items of national importance, but the 1950s were an era of the destruction and dismantling of the British country house and such sales were not uncommon, as was exemplified in the Destruction of the Country House exhibition of 1974. Among the 909 paintings described as old masters were works by Thomas Lawrence including a version of his state portrait of George IV, and his portrait of the 10th Earl of Westmorland, proving the earl's estranged wife did not totally <b>forget</b> <b>him.</b> Also in the sale were numerous works by Kneller, Romney, Lely, Snyders and at least ten attributed to Van Dyke: the paintings {{are listed in the}} [...] "{{contents of}} the house" [...] together with Tudor, Chippendale, Sheraton and Louis XV furniture, and an [...] "assortment of bed sheets", [...] "3 new towels and an [...] "old bedspread".|$|E

In order to keep Rintarō in the Steins Gate world line, he must be implanted with a powerful memory that helps distinguish it from other world lines. The two travel back to June 30, 2005, where Kurisu attempts to talk with the young Rintarō, only to result in him getting into a car accident instead, leaving her too afraid to attempt another trip to the past. Back in the present, Kurisu discovers Mayuri and the others also possess faint memories of Rintarō, which are soon awakened when she does an imitation of his persona, Kyōma Hōōin. Encouraged by everyone's feelings, Kurisu returns to the past, this time succeeding in her mission by implanting the concept of Kyōma Hōōin into Rintarō's mind and giving him his first kiss, which led him to take on his 'mad scientist' persona to protect Mayuri. With this, Kurisu manages to bring Rintarō back to the Steins Gate world line and the movie ends with Rintarō asking Kurisu if she will return his first kiss to him. Smiling, Kurisu says [...] "Never".|$|E
