Among the accomplishments of the session were raising the state's minimum wage to $7.25 per hour, {{increasing}} the speed limit on major state highways to , and implementing new safety requirements for social workers and coal miners. Additional legislation stalled after negotiations over how to make the state's retirement system solvent reached an impasse. Fletcher indicated that he would consider calling the Assembly into special session later in the year. In July, Fletcher called the session and included 67 items on its agenda. Democrats in the state House of Representatives maintained that none of the items were urgent enough to warrant a special session. They claimed the call was an attempt by Fletcher to boost his sagging poll numbers against Beshear, and the House adjourned after only 90 minutes without acting on any of Fletcher's agenda. Fletcher denied the claims and insisted that a tax <b>incentive</b> <b>program</b> was needed immediately to keep the state in the running for a proposed coal gasification plant to be built by Peabody Energy. After negotiating with legislators, Fletcher called another session for August; the session included only the tax <b>incentive</b> <b>program,</b> which the Assembly passed.|$|E

40|$|Thoroughbred <b>incentive</b> <b>programs</b> are subsidy {{policies}} funded {{from state}} parimutuel tax revenue {{designed to promote}} regional race horse breeding and ownership. At issue is an ongoing debate concerning the effectiveness of alternative policies. Empirical results in-dicate that <b>incentive</b> <b>programs</b> have a positive economic effect, but gains to Thoroughbred breeders {{can be obtained by}} reallocating tax revenue to non-restricted purses. A policy allocating tax revenue to non-restricted purses shifts yearling demand and increases prices, while breeder subsidies shift only the supply function and therefore lower prices. Conse-quently, breeder revenues increase in response to a policy thatfavors non-restrictedpurses over subsidies. Key Words: <b>incentive</b> <b>programs,</b> parimutuel horse racing, subsidy, tax, Subsidy policies for agricultural commodities have long been used as a means to stabilize supply and augment demand. Thoroughbred breeder/owner <b>incentive</b> <b>programs</b> are state ad-ministered subsidy policies designed to pro-mote regional race horse breeding and own-ership. Currently, 28 states operate <b>incentive</b> <b>programs</b> that transfer one-hundred million dollars annually to Thoroughbred breeders and owners (American Horse Council). Breeder/owner <b>incentive</b> <b>programs</b> are funded through a tax levied on parimutuel wa-gering pools. This share of tax revenue is transferred to owners and breeders under a va-riety of alternative subsidy programs.
