5|$|Salt glands {{are used}} by seabirds {{to deal with the}} salt they ingest by {{drinking}} and feeding (particularly on crustaceans), and to help them osmoregulate.

5|$|A {{low-level}} circulation {{formed from}} the frontal cloud band on September 26 about 460miles (740km) east of central Florida. Dean was first identified {{on the afternoon}} of September 26 as a subtropical storm. An Air Force reconnaissance flight was sent to Dean on September 27 and only reported winds of 35mph (55km/h) at 23miles (37kilometres) from the center. A pressure of 999millibars (29.50inHg) indicated that Dean was strengthening as it headed northward. Additionally, satellite pictures showed that the subtropical cyclone was <b>emerging</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cloud. This data also showed that the storm was gaining tropical characteristics and was given the name Dean {{on the afternoon of}} September 27.|$|E
5|$|At a {{barometric}} pressure of 218 atmospheres, the critical point {{of water is}} 375°C. At a depth of 3,000meters, the {{barometric pressure}} of sea water is more than 300atmospheres (as salt water is denser than fresh water). At this depth and pressure, seawater becomes supercritical at a temperature of 407°C (see image). However the increase in salinity at this depth pushes the water closer to its critical point. Thus, water <b>emerging</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hottest parts of some hydrothermal vents, black smokers and submarine volcanoes can be a supercritical fluid, possessing physical properties between those of a gas and those of a liquid.|$|E

Black reveals that he knows Roe was once a promising student, and accuses her of being cowed by a fear of failure. Frightened, she reveals the location of Butler's farm. Police raid the farm, freeing several captive youths, including Bryce, but Butler is nowhere to be found.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the pattern}} of Hawaiian volcano formation, Kīlauea started as a {{submarine}} volcano, gradually building itself up through underwater eruptions of alkali basalt lava before <b>emerging</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sea {{with a series of}} explosive eruptions about 50,000 to 100,000 years ago. Since then, the volcano's activity has likely been as it is now, a continual stream of effusive and explosive eruptions of roughly the same pattern as its activity in the last 200 or 300 years.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the pattern}} of Hawaiian volcano formation, Mauna Loa would have started as a {{submarine}} volcano, gradually building itself up through underwater eruptions of alkali basalt before <b>emerging</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sea {{through a series of}} surtseyan eruptions about 400,000 years ago. Since then, the volcano has remained active, with a history of effusive and explosive eruptions, including 33 eruptions since the first well-documented eruption in 1843. Although Mauna Loa's activity has been overshadowed in recent years by that of its neighbor Kīlauea, it remains active.|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to examine the location of oviposition by the phorid fly Megaselia halterata (Wood) (Diptera: Phoridae) in uncased and cased compost. Clearly, {{a majority of the}} gravid females choose oviposition sites directly after entering the top layer of the compost. In uncased compost, 60 % of all adults <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> top of four compost layers of equal thickness. When the compost was covered by a casing layer which was still uncolonized by Agaricus bisporus, oviposition was further concentrated in the top compost layer. In this situation, 91 % of all adults <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> top compost layer whereas only 1. 5 % <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> casing. When the casing layer was colonized by mushroom mycelium, 45 % of all adults <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> casing layer and 53 % <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> top compost layer. Further concentration in the top compost layer and the casing layer occurred as a result of upward migration of larvae. When compost was cased after oviposition, up to 43 % of all adults <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> casing layer. We concluded that in the control of phorid infestations with insect pathogenic nematodes, applications in uncased compost can be restricted to the upper compost layer. When compost and casing are filled simultaneously, nematode applications in the casing layer only could be considere...|$|R

5|$|In 1947, a {{prominent}} radio source was identified overlapping {{the location of}} M87, and this was labeled Virgo-A. This source was confirmed to be M87 by 1953, and the linear relativistic jet <b>emerging</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> core of the galaxy was suggested as the cause. This jet extended from the core at a position angle of 260° to an angular distance of 20″ with an angular width of 2″. In 1969–70, a strong component of the radio emission was found to closely align with the optical source of the jet.|$|E
5|$|In the {{modified}} Hubble sequence galaxy morphological classification scheme of French astronomer Gérard de Vaucouleurs, M87 is categorized as an E0p galaxy. The E0 designation {{is used for}} an elliptical galaxy that displays no flattening—that is, it appears spherical. A 'p' suffix indicates a peculiar galaxy that does not fit cleanly into the classification scheme; in this case, the peculiarity denotes {{the presence of the}} jet <b>emerging</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> core. M87 is considered a type-cD galaxy, which is a supergiant D class galaxy. The latter category, first proposed by American astronomer William W. Morgan in 1958, is a galaxy that has an elliptical-like nucleus surrounded by an extensive, dustless, diffuse envelope.|$|E
5|$|Like mayflies, {{stoneflies}} and dragonflies, but to {{a somewhat}} lesser extent, caddisflies are an indicator of good water quality; they die out of streams with polluted waters. They {{are an important part}} of the food web, both larvae and adults being eaten by many fish. The newly hatched adult is particularly vulnerable as it struggles to the surface after <b>emerging</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> submerged pupa, and as it dries its wings. The fish find these new adults easy pickings, and fishing flies resembling them can be successful for anglers at the right time of year.|$|E
