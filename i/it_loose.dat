Sideshow Bob then ties up Homer, Marge, Lisa, Maggie, and Santa's Little Helper {{to ensure they}} will not interfere with his plan. Sideshow Bob enters Bart's room, ready to kill him. Bart flees {{out the window and}} tries to escape, but he cannot jump off the boat. Sideshow Bob catches up to Bart and offers him a last request. Having noticed a sign saying that Springfield is fifteen miles away, Bart gets an idea; he compliments Sideshow Bob on his beautiful voice and asks him to sing the entire score of the H.M.S. Pinafore, to stall for time as the houseboat floats to Springfield. After the performance, Sideshow Bob advances on Bart again, but the boat runs aground, interrupting Sideshow Bob before he can finish him off. Sideshow Bob is arrested, and the Simpsons return home.|$|E

25|$|As {{the date}} was nearing, a new device was {{introduced}} by the Navy Department. Because of Du Pont's often-expressed fears of torpedoes in the harbor, the Department had called on the man who designed the monitors, John Ericsson, to provide some means of defense. He {{came up with a}} raft-like structure made up of heavy timbers that could be attached to a ship's bow. Each raft carried grappling hooks intended to snag the mooring lines of enemy torpedoes. It also carried its own torpedo, so it could blast its way through the obstructions. Two of the rafts were built and sent down to South Carolina in time for the attack. After considering the steering and handling problems the rafts would introduce, Du Pont's captains were unwilling to mount them on their ships. The torpedo was particularly worrisome, as collisions between ships in the narrow channel with unknown currents could be expected. Only one captain, John Rodgers of Weehawken, could be persuaded to carry the raft on his ship, and then only without the torpedo. In the event, the motion of the raft pounded his ship so severely that Rodgers decided to cast <b>it</b> <b>loose</b> before it had cleared any enemy torpedoes.|$|E
500|$|The English poet Stephen Spender (1909–1995) called [...] "In Praise of Limestone" [...] {{one of the}} century's {{greatest}} poems, {{describing it}} as [...] "the perfect fusion between Auden's personality {{and the power of}} acute moral observation of a more generalized psychological situation, which is his great gift". Literary critic David Daiches found <b>it</b> <b>loose</b> and unfulfilling. The poem became [...] "In Praise of Sandstone" [...] at the hand of Australian poet John Tranter (1943– [...] ), who created a poetic form called the [...] "terminal" [...] in which only the line-ending words of the source poem are kept in the writing of a new work.|$|E

[...] Timberlake revealed that he went [...] "left", regarding going more rock, not in how he developed the song, but in the way he sang the song. [...] "I wanted to sing the song like a rock and roll singer, not an R singer. That's the approach." [...] The day before recording, Timberlake and Timbaland had listened to David Bowie's [...] "Rebel Rebel" [...] and the Rapture's [...] "House of Jealous Lovers". Timberlake wanted to achieve the songs' [...] "raw energy". Timberlake said that he modeled himself on Bowie and Prince, and described the song as Bowie and David Byrne [...] "covering" [...] James Brown's 1970 song [...] "Sex Machine". Timberlake said that the song [...] "doesn't qualify as rock or straight funk" [...] and that he was happy with the description [...] "club funk". He was [...] "keen for a new musical direction" [...] following the release of his first album, Justified. [...] "I listened to the radio for a few months and thought, 'All this sounds like shit, what do I want to hear?'. That's really all I did.

2500|$|Hills or ridges {{in front}} of the {{railroad}} road bed would have to have a flat-bottomed, V shaped [...] "cut" [...] made to get the railroad through the ridge or hill. The type of material determined the slope of the V and how much material would have to be removed. Ideally, these cuts would be matched with valley fills that could use the dug out material to bring the road bed up to grade--cut and fill construction. In the 1860s there was no heavy equipment {{that could be used to}} make these cuts or haul it away to make the fills. The options were to dig it out by pick and shovel, haul the hillside material by wheelbarrow and/or horse or mule cart or blast <b>it</b> <b>loose.</b> To blast a V shaped cut out, they had to drill several holes up to [...] deep in the material, fill them with black powder, and blast the material away. Since the Central Pacific was in a hurry, they were profligate users of black powder to blast their way though the hills. The only disadvantage came when a nearby valley needed fill to get across it. The explosive technique often blew most of the potential fill material down the hillside, making it unavailable for fill. Initially, many valleys were bridged by [...] "temporary" [...] trestles that could be rapidly built and were later replaced by much lower maintenance and permanent solid fill. The existing railroad made transporting and putting material in valleys much easier—load it on railway dump cars, haul where needed and dump it over the side of the trestle.|$|E
