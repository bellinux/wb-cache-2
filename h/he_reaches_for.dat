5|$|The Child has curly {{blond hair}} and sits on a white cloth, {{animated}} and upright, {{at the side of}} the Virgin's lap. Like Mary, his body is shown frontally, his head in three quarters view. <b>He</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> what seems to be a parrot perched on her lap. At some point the Child's nudity was covered up; this overpaint was removed during a late 20th-century restoration. He is intended to represent both the host and Eucharist, common allusions in Early Netherlandish art and reflecting that the panel was intended for the celebration of mass.|$|E
5|$|Shelly becomes possessed as well, forcing Scotty {{to chop up}} {{her body}} with an axe and bury the remains. Shaken by the experience, he leaves {{to find a way}} back to town. When Ash goes to check on Linda, he is horrified to find that she has already begun to turn. A badly-injured Scotty {{staggers}} into the cabin and dies of his wounds, having been attacked by the trees. While Ash tries {{to figure out what to}} do, both Linda and Cheryl pretend to be cured, only to quickly revert to their demonic forms. Ash locks Linda outside, but she returns and tries to stab him before he impales her with a dagger. He tries to cut up her remains with a chainsaw, but can't bring himself to do so, and ends up burying her instead. When <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> her necklace on the ground, she escapes again trying to kill him. Ash decapitates her with a shovel, and her headless body bleeds all over Ash's face as it tries to rape him before he escapes. Back in the cabin, he quickly realizes that Cheryl has forced open the trapdoor. After wounding her with a shotgun, he heads to the basement for more ammunition. There, the entity tortures him by dousing him with blood from a pipe, while more blood seeps from the walls and ceilings.|$|E
25|$|Near the {{beginning}} of their second winter the Skraelings come again to trade. This time one of Karlsefni's men kills a Skraeling as <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> Norse weapons. The Skraelings run off. Karlsefni fears the natives will return, hostile and in larger numbers. He forms a plan for the coming battle. The Skraelings do come again and the Norsemen manage to fight them off. Karlsefni stays there {{for the remainder of the}} winter and returns to Greenland next spring. During their stay in Vinland, Karlsefni and Gudrid had the son Snorri.|$|E

500|$|Mahone's {{anxiety is}} evident when <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> the varatril pills hidden inside his pen. When Mahone {{runs out of}} pills, he is tense and easily agitated. Fichtner notes the erratic {{behavior}} of his character, commenting, [...] "The more twisted the better! Who wants to play a straight-away FBI guy?" [...] He says that the actions that Mahone takes are affected by [...] "some {{of the things that}} Mahone has {{in the back of his}} closet—and in the back of his mind, the voices he is hearing about his own life." [...] Andy Dehnart of MSNBC observes that Mahone, [...] "as played by William Fichtner, always seemed to be on the edge of a nervous breakdown." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{they wait}} for the fly {{to land on the}} flypaper, the two talk about their families. Walt expresses that he should have died already and tries to think of the perfect moment to have done so: after he had enough money, after Holly was born, before his surgery and before Skyler knew what he'd been doing. He finally decides the perfect moment to die would have been the night Jane died. Walt then tells Jesse of his bar {{conversation}} with Donald Margolis, Jane's father, on the day that she died. He tries to calculate the chances of meeting both father and daughter in different scenarios on the same night despite having never met either beforehand, but finds the odds too astronomical to calculate. Jesse, who is unaware of Walt's direct involvement in Jane's death, is surprised to hear this, but before he can ask more, he sees the fly up near the ceiling. He constructs a make-shift support for a step-ladder, asking Walt to hold it steady while <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> it. Walt, nearly asleep, begs Jesse to not hurt himself getting the fly. For a moment, it appears that Walt in his sleepy state is about to confess to Jesse how he stood by while Jane choked to death, but he stops at apologizing for Jane's death. Jesse tells him Jane's death was nobody's fault, but he still misses her. As Jesse begins wildly swatting at the fly, a sobbing Walt falls asleep. Jesse fails to get the fly and with Walt asleep, starts to climbs back down, but sees the fly land on the ladder. He swats and kills it.|$|E

5000|$|In the 13th century Old Norse Thiðrekssaga, Hildibrand defeats his son, Alibrand. Alibrand {{offers his}} sword in {{surrender}} but attempts to strike Hildibrand as <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> it. Hildibrand taunts him {{for having been}} taught to fight by a woman, but then asks if he is Alibrand and they are reconciled.|$|E
50|$|After {{the player}} manages to survive through {{numerous}} challenges, many {{reminiscent of the}} challenges faced by Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark, he collects several artifacts, presumably of great value. At {{the very end of}} the game, he finds the ultimate artifact of the pyramid. However, as <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> it, the pyramid collapses around him and the game ends.|$|E
60|$|The ranger captain stood dumb, motionless. But he saw Longstreth's instant action, and awkwardly <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> the outstretched hand.|$|R

5000|$|Van Der Luijt {{reflects}} {{a bit of}} a Keith Jarrett influence, particularly when <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> some wide gospel chord voicings. Essentially, however, he's his own man, with a muscular, surging swing and a powerful left hand. Van Der Luijt doesn't quite sound like anyone else out there, which is certainly an asset. He's also an engaging, witty composer. - Allaboutjazz.com http://www.allaboutjazz.com ...|$|E
5000|$|Antonello da Messina's Madonna and Child is superficially {{very like}} that of Verrocchio, but it is much less formal and both {{the mother and the}} child appear to be moving rather than posing for the painter. The {{foreshortened}} elbow of the Child as <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> his mother's breast occurs in Raphael's work and can be seen in a different form in Michelangelo's Doni Tondo.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reviewer}} of a Chicago {{production at}} Northlight Theatre in the Josephine Louis Theatre of Northwestern University wrote: [...] "But {{for all the}} bright lines and smart talk, when <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> profundity, all he can come up with, at best, is sentimentality. The laughter in his plays is strong, but the tears are all too predictable and the emotions are all too weak." ...|$|E

5000|$|The song {{received}} a positive review from Taste of Country, {{who wrote that}} [...] "So many of the songs on The Big Revival recall memories of Chesney’s biggest hits without feeling like duplicates.

60|$|Quickly {{and silently}} he stepped toward the door, but, as <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> the knob {{to throw it}} open, his wife's hand fell upon his wrist.|$|R
50|$|It is 12.05 am, so he gets up, forgetting he's naked, {{and knocks}} angrily {{at the door}} loudly shushing. The music stops, and he walks {{back to his room}} just as the door closes and locks itself. <b>He</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> his key, only to {{remember}} he does not have it. To make matters worse, he finally realises that he is naked and starts to panic. Bean hides in a doorway as a couple come past from a night out.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the final}} episode, he {{suffered}} from hallucinations {{that led him to}} find a fragment of an artifact called the [...] "Ring of Truth". Before the episode ends, he has another hallucination that reveals that the fragment of the [...] "Ring" [...] also joins together with another fragment that his father had acquired earlier in the series.

The black figure, still wearing gold bangles, charges to grab the jewel box with a horrible laugh.|$|E
