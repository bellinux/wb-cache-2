5|$|The most {{extensive}} early study of female homosexuality {{was provided by}} the Institute for Sex Research, who published an in-depth report of the sexual experiences of American women in 1953. More than 8,000 women were interviewed by Alfred Kinsey and the staff of the Institute for Sex Research in a book titled Sexual Behavior in the Human Female, popularly known as part of the Kinsey Report. The Kinsey Report's dispassionate discussion of homosexuality as a form of human sexual behavior was revolutionary. Up to this study, only physicians and psychiatrists studied sexual behavior, and almost always the results were <b>interpreted</b> <b>with</b> a moral view.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the denomination's existence, {{theological}} battles were {{fought over}} how the Confession of Faith would be interpreted. During the 19th century, Old School Presbyterians insisted that the Confession be interpreted according to strict Calvinism, while the New School Presbyterians favored a looser interpretation. From 1910 to 1927, the Confession of Faith was officially <b>interpreted</b> <b>with</b> reference to five fundamental beliefs: biblical inerrancy, the virgin birth, substitutionary atonement, the bodily resurrection, and the miracles of Christ.|$|E

Furthermore, it deals with memory as such, {{as well as with}} working memory, which is consequently correlated with sign language users, with the process of simultaneous <b>interpreting</b> and <b>with</b> sign language <b>interpreting.</b> The empirical part is based on a qualitative research - testing of working memory among a group of sign language interpreters, spoken language interpreters and non- interpreters through Reading Span Task and Corsi's test. The results form the basis for a hypothesis necessary for the ensuing quantitative exploration: interpreting has a positive influence on the quality of working memory among sign language interpreters...|$|R

25|$|Accuracy figures {{need to be}} <b>interpreted</b> <b>with</b> care. The {{accuracy}} of an analog instrument usually refers to full-scale deflection; a measurement of 30V on the 100V scale of a 3% meter is subject to an error of 3V, 10% of the reading.

25|$|Ancient Chinese texts, {{like those}} {{which make up}} the 'Xing Yi Classics', often contain {{characters}} whose meanings are obscure or have disappeared completely from the Chinese language.

The results can be problematic, producing translations which are linguistically correct but inconsistent within a fighting or martial context.|$|E
25|$|These evidences {{cannot be}} <b>interpreted</b> <b>with</b> certainty, {{but it is}} {{possible}} that Govindachandra invaded the Pala kingdom sometime around 1146 CE, and advanced up to Munger, where he issued the 1146 CE inscription. Madanapala repulsed this invasion, and chased the Gahadavala army up to Patna before returning to his own kingdom. Another possibility is that Madanapala invaded the Gahadavala kingdom and advanced up to Patna. Govindachandra repulsed this invasion, and advanced up to Munger in the enemy's pursuit, before turning back.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{studies have}} been {{utilised}} {{in the study of}} pre-historic population movements. On the whole, scientists agree that there is evidence for a migration during the Neolithic. However, they cannot agree on the extent of this movement. The conclusions of studies appear to be 'operator dependent'. That is, results vary depending on what underlying mutation rates are assumed, and conclusions are drawn from how the authors 'envisage' their results fit with known archaeological and historic processes. Consequently, such studies must be <b>interpreted</b> <b>with</b> caution.|$|E

25|$|Each {{of these}} points alone can {{give rise to}} false results. Due to the {{combined}} effects of all error sources yeast two-hybrid have to be <b>interpreted</b> <b>with</b> caution. The probability of generating false positives means that all interactions should be confirmed by a high confidence assay, for example co-immunoprecipitation of the endogenous proteins, which is difficult for large scale protein–protein interaction data. Alternatively, Y2H data can be verified using multiple Y2H variants or bioinformatics techniques. The latter test whether interacting proteins are expressed at the same time, share some common features (such as gene ontology annotations or certain network topologies), have homologous interactions in other species.|$|E
25|$|As an {{alternative}} to single-blind and double-blind review, authors and reviewers are encouraged to declare their conflicts of interest when the names of authors and sometimes reviewers are known to the other. When conflicts are reported, the conflicting reviewer can be prohibited from reviewing and discussing the manuscript, or his or her review can instead be <b>interpreted</b> <b>with</b> the reported conflict in mind; the latter option is more often adopted when the conflict of interest is mild, such as a previous professional connection or a distant family relation. The incentive for reviewers to declare their conflicts of interest {{is a matter of}} professional ethics and individual integrity. Even when the reviews are not public, they are still a matter of record and the reviewer's credibility depends upon how they represent themselves among their peers. Some software engineering journals, such as the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, use non-blind reviews with reporting to editors of conflicts of interest by both authors and reviewers.|$|E
25|$|There are {{few studies}} on the {{affordability}} of water and sewer bills in Latin America. The Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) analyzed multi-purpose household surveys conducted between 1995 and 1999 in 10 countries to assess the share of household income spent on water supply services. These data show that the expenditures on water vary between 0.4% of total expenditures in rural Panama to 3.0% in Kingston, Jamaica. For the households in the poorest income decile expenditures on water are higher, varying from 0.6% in rural Panama to 6.5% in Kingston, Jamaica. However, these figures have to be <b>interpreted</b> <b>with</b> caution. First, {{it is not clear}} how water expenditures were defined in the surveys. It seems that in some cases expenditures to buy bottled water and water from tankers were included, while in other cases they were excluded. Second, the sample includes both households with and without access to piped water systems. Therefore, especially in rural areas where coverage tends to be low, the shares are only a poor indication on the affordability of water bills. Third, it is not explicit if sewer bills are included in the analysis, although this is most likely the case, since sewer bills are always a surcharge on the water bill and are thus perceived by most households as part of their water expenditures.|$|E

In their own study, when they controlled for two methodological problems, the hard-easy effect was [...] "almost [...] eliminated". They argued that [...] "the hard-easy effect has been <b>interpreted</b> <b>with</b> insufficient attention to the scale-end effects, the linear dependency, and the regression effects in data, and that the continued adherence {{to the idea of}} a 'cognitive overconfidence bias' is mediated by selective attention to particular data sets".
