40|$|This volume {{consists}} of three separate reports. Part One - Project Report: The project report is written as a chronological account of my work on porting APL to the Macintosh. It explains the main difficulties which I encountered during the work but does not specify how to use APL nor any details about how MacAPL <b>works</b> <b>internally.</b> <b>Part</b> Two - User Manual: The MacAPL user manual is basically a port of the APL 11 manual, adapted to the new Macintosh version. It gives an introduction to using MacAPL but does not attempt to explain the APL language. References to books about APL are given in the Project Report. Part Three - Technical Manual: This is a short introduction to {{the inner workings of}} MacAPL. It explains the basic operation and mentions some of the data structures used. Hopefully it will be of some use to those who wish to modify and enhance MacAPL...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Protein-protein {{interaction}} {{has proven}} to be a valuable biological knowledge and starting point for understanding how the cell <b>internally</b> <b>works.</b> In this paper, we propose a method for PPI prediction using only the primary structure information of protein sequence. The method is developed based on inter-domain linker region knowledge and a combination of pairwise similarity and support vector machine techniques. Two protein sequences may interact by the mean of the similarities between the domain-linker regions they contain. The method is tested in different datasets from yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae protein interaction and showed higher specificity, sensitivity and accuracy than the PIPE, MLE and decision forest methods...|$|R
50|$|The media {{scandal that}} follows Joss's death seems to push grief to the side. Everyone is {{preoccupied with the}} secret life of Joss Moody. However, the reader can see the natural and varied stages of grief take their course {{throughout}} the book. Although Colman is focused on spilling his rage into an account of his father's life to be written by journalist Sophie Stones, he cannot escape dealing with the grief of his father's death. His anger is a different form of grief than that of his mother. Millie, already at peace with who Joss was, is free to <b>internally</b> <b>work</b> through her sorrow and come to terms with Joss's absence.|$|R
