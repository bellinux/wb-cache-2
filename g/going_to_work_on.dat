5|$|Nomura {{worked on}} the {{character}} designs for the main cast. He was originally only <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> Aya and Eve, but after seeing the settings for the other characters, he offered to design them too. The team wanted to emphasize the character's sexuality. As part of this, the team included a scene where Aya takes a shower. This {{was inspired by a}} similar scene in Parasite Eve II. When the title was being developed for PSP, the team's main challenge with the character was to make her look as realistic as possible while retaining her established physical traits. Using this new realism, the team wanted to portray the fear felt by humans when faced with such threats through Aya. Achieving this realism proved {{one of the most difficult}} aspects of development. Her alternate costumes were not a high priority for the team, so their artists had high creative freedom.|$|E

Three days later, NHA owners—at a meeting that did not include Livingstone—voted to suspend the Blueshirts franchise to keep the number of {{teams in the league}} even. Toronto players were put in a lottery and claimed by other teams, although they were to be returned to Toronto when the franchise was reinstated.

The big difference with going to work here is the isolation, because you really are isolated. You don't have a lot of support from the ground. You really are on your own." ...|$|E

She stated her main idea for the project was to [...] "evolve {{as an artist and}} a visionary", which was taken from a poem she wrote during The Stripped Tour (2003). In an interview with Billboard magazine, Aguilera expressed dissatisfaction with contemporary music, as technology [...] "has advanced itself so anybody can be a singer". Thus, Aguilera took musical inspirations from old-school jazz, blues and soul records performed by her 1920s-1940s idols including Billie Holiday, Otis Redding, Etta James and Ella Fitzgerald, which she viewed as [...] "music that really had heart".|$|E

Clough was apparently angered that Taylor did not inform him about the deal. Clough attacked Taylor in a tabloid article on 3 July 1983 as being a [...] "rattlesnake", [...] "a snake-in-the-grass" [...] and said that [...] "We pass {{each other on the}} A52 <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> most days of the week.

Well, she loves him but I think he loves moving around the world more. He's a drifter. I wouldn't put any money on a happy ending for them. He's such a rolling stone and she's so emotionally wrong that I don't think it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> <b>On</b> the plus side, I think this pair probably have a fantastic sex life and a great time down the pub." ...|$|E

2500|$|Anwar Shaikh {{among others}} replied, that regrettably the {{mathematical}} formalizations offered by neo-Ricardian theorists to interpret Marx's idea were really more a sleight-of-hand, since, {{in the process}} of modelling, highly questionable assumptions were introduced which {{had nothing to do with}} Marx. Moreover, one could use the same mathematical techniques with different assumptions to compute results that were quite consistent with Marx’s theory.

2500|$|Yano and Sano were {{originally}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> the score together, with Yano handling the orchestral segments and Sano {{in charge of}} percussion and bass. Take wanted the soundtrack to stand out, but when Sano added together their two styles of music, he negatively compared the result to a song from Japanese variety show Nanikore Chin Hyakkei. Sano was so distressed that he insisted Yano handle {{all aspects of the}} music. The soundtrack and soundscape were created using 5.1 surround sound, which Sano found to be a mixed experience. While this enabled a wider range and depth of sounds, it also made coordination and balance more difficult. Despite the difficulties, he found the resultant effect superior to the two-channel sound of his previous projects. The theme song [...] "The Vanishing Sky" [...] was composed by Yano and arranged by Sano, with lyrics and vocals performed in English by Asako Yoshihiro.|$|E
