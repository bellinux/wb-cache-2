Over 70 percent of all submissions to the <b>International</b> <b>Taxation</b> Working Group and close to half of all submissions to the Individual Taxation Working Group came from individual U.S. expatriates, many citing specific consequences of FATCA in their countries of residence, and nearly all calling both for residence-based taxation and the repeal of FATCA.|$|E

40|$|This article {{compares the}} two most {{important}} methods applied by treaties to avoid <b>international</b> double <b>taxation</b> in order to define which method is more suitable to achieve the objectives pursued by Brazilian diplomacy. It specifies origin, definition, characteristics and special traits from both the credit and the exemption methods. Brazilian diplomacy is examined with regard to <b>international</b> double <b>taxation</b> by referring to all treaties signed by the country and drawing attention to the characteristics which group them. The models employed, the methods chosen and the objectives pursued in the treaties, specially the avoidance of <b>international</b> double <b>taxation,</b> <b>international</b> cooperation among tax authorities and guaranties to tax payers in order to encourage international investments are relevant to the study. The analysis is focused on the effects and characteristics of both methods in regard to Brazilian objectives and perspective. The conclusion verifies why and how the exemption method is more suitable to achieve more international investments, to better prevent simultaneously <b>international</b> double <b>taxation</b> and <b>international</b> tax avoidance, and to concede priority to the Source State, notwithstanding its implication of greater reduction of the tax revenue...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the parent-subsidiary {{structure}} of multinational firms created by cross-border mergers and acquisitions {{is affected by the}} prospect of <b>international</b> double <b>taxation.</b> Specifically, the likelihood of parent firm location in a country following a cross-border takeover is reduced by high <b>international</b> double <b>taxation</b> of foreign-source income. At the same time, countries with high <b>international</b> double <b>taxation</b> attract smaller numbers of parent firms. A unilateral elimination of worldwide taxation by the United States is simulated to increase the proportion of parent firms locating in the United States following cross-border mergers and acquisitions from 53 % to 58 %.

40|$|In an {{international}} merger or acquisition, the national residences of the acquirer {{and the target}} determine {{to what extent the}} newly created multinational firm is subject to <b>international</b> double <b>taxation.</b> This paper presents evidence that the parent-subsidiary structure of newly created multinational firms reflects the prospect of <b>international</b> double <b>taxation.</b> The number of acquiring firms at the national level similarly reflects <b>international</b> double <b>taxation.</b> The evidence suggests that tax policy in the form of lower tax rates or the elimination of residence-based worldwide taxation attracts additional parent companies of multinational firms. On the basis of our estimation, we simulate the impact of the elimination of worldwide taxation by the United States on parent firm selection. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we sought to address the <b>international</b> double <b>taxation</b> {{phenomenon}} from two different standpoints. To begin with, {{in the first part}} we analysed the framework of <b>international</b> double <b>taxation,</b> and how this topic was tackled in both Romanian and international literature. <b>International</b> double <b>taxation</b> has been analyzed, mutatis mutandis, from an economic perspective, more precisely in terms of the implications that it generates on economies, on added value, on capital flows, on the internationalisation of business. Second, I believed it was important to analyse <b>international</b> double <b>taxation</b> from a legal perspective, through the jurisdictional effects of obtaining income or holding property at the European or international level. Romania's case is carefully approached in this paper, aiming to highlight the issues Romania is facing concerning cooperation in tax matters with authorities from other countries, how the more than 80 double taxation conventions are applied and interpreted, but also other aspects that should be considered by the Romanian tax authorities, based on the provisions of the Fiscal Code and the Fiscal Procedure Code. The article ends by presenting, commenting on and analysing two test cases in <b>international</b> double <b>taxation,</b> of remarkable importance and actuality for Romanian jurisprudence to observe how complex double taxation mechanisms operate in practice. The conclusion of this article emphasises the importance ofsignificant “steps” achieved by Romania on the path to creating a true “fiscal area” in the European Union, as well as the “corridors” that should be inserted to correct economi c – legal and economic deficiencies and gaps, in order to strengthen the fiscal area. ...|$|R
