5|$|Horsfield {{signed for}} Sheffield United on loan in February 2006, but {{appeared}} {{in just three}} games under manager Neil Warnock in the four-month spell. Both Horsfield and Warnock wanted to terminate the loan prematurely, but West Bromwich Albion had already agreed to sell the player to United {{at the end of}} the season and refused to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the deal. The permanent transfer went through in May 2006 for a fee of £1.2million, with Horsfield commenting that he and Warnock had resolved their differences.|$|E
5|$|Alan begins {{driving the}} car down the road, and sees Frank Jr. and Betty in front of him. They look behind to wave to Alan, and he waves back. However, the pair keep driving while looking backwards. Observing that a {{railroad}} with an oncoming train is near, Alan desperately tries to signal to them to stop waving and look ahead. When they do not pay attention to him and continue waving, Alan shields his eyes as the two drive right {{into the path of}} the train and are killed. Back in the present, at the funeral, Hal enters his police car, and decides to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the road in order to prevent more traffic accidents from occurring.|$|E
5|$|David Bell, the Home Office negotiator, kept contradicting himself, {{as if in}} a bid {{to prolong}} the negotiations. He would agree to our terms, then he would try and tell us it was out of his hands, and <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> his word. If it was out of the Home Officer's hands—then whose hands was it in? I think the final stages were messed around by the Home Office so that our protest could help to divert the public's {{attention}} from the Poll Tax revolt that was going on throughout the country. As Alan Lord was snatched after being asked to negotiate on behalf of us all, this made us all more defiant about ending the protest.|$|E
60|$|Which was better? {{he asked}} himself. All this was Dede's own thought. It {{was what she}} had meant when she prayed he would go broke. He held up his {{offending}} right arm. It wasn't the same old arm. Of course she could not love that arm and that body as she had loved the strong, clean arm and body of years before. He didn't like that arm and body himself. A young whippersnapper {{had been able to}} take liberties with it. It had <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> him. He sat up suddenly. No, by God, he had <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> it! He had <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> himself. He had <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> Dede. She was right, a thousand times right, and she had sense enough to know it, sense enough to refuse to marry a money slave with a whiskey-rotted carcass.|$|R

5|$|Day-Lewis {{returned}} to the stage in 1989 to work with Richard Eyre, in Hamlet at the National Theatre, London, but collapsed during the scene where the ghost of Hamlet's father appears before him. He began sobbing uncontrollably and refused to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> stage; he was replaced by Jeremy Northam who finished the performance word-and-action-perfect and received a standing ovation. Ian Charleson then formally replaced Day-Lewis {{for the rest of}} the run, except that Charleson's ill-health forced Northam to stand in again many times. Although the incident was officially attributed to exhaustion, Day-Lewis later claimed to have seen the ghost of his own father. He has not appeared on stage since. The media attention following his breakdown on-stage contributed to his decision to eventually move from England to Ireland in the mid-1990s to regain a sense of privacy amidst his increasing fame.|$|E
5|$|It did {{not take}} Louis XVIII long to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> {{one of his many}} promises. He and his ComptrollerGeneral of Finance Baron Louis were {{determined}} not to let the exchequer fall into deficit (there was a 75million franc debt inherited from Napoleon I), and took fiscal measures to ensure this. Louis XVIII assured the French that the unpopular taxes on tobacco, wine and salt would be abolished when he was restored, but he failed to do so, which led to rioting in Bordeaux. Expenditures on the army was slashed in the 1815 budget– in 1814, the military had accounted for 55% of government spending.|$|E
5|$|Larry Schmittou had {{originally}} been encouraged by the New York Yankees organization to establish the Sounds as a Triple-A team, {{but he refused to}} <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> his previous promise to partner with the Reds at Double-A. After the split with Cincinnati, the Sounds made their first affiliation switch in 1980, becoming the Double-A affiliate of the Yankees. Under manager Stump Merrill, the 1980 Sounds finished {{the first half of the}} season one-and-a-half games behind the Memphis Chicks. In the second half, the team finished in first place, 14 games ahead of the second-place Montgomery Rebels. In the Western Division championship series, Nashville lost to Memphis, three games to one. Nine Southern League records were set during the season, the team's pitching staff led the league in ERA and strikeouts, and Steve Balboni, the league MVP, led the league with 101runs, 34home runs, 122RBI, and 288total bases. Pitcher Andy McGaffigan was selected as the league's top pitcher. The team also set a league attendance record, when a total of 575,676fans visited Greer Stadium. This record still stands as of the completion of the 2016 season. Their 97–46 record is the franchise's all-time best. In 2001, the 1980 Sounds were ranked as the sixty-ninth greatest minor league baseball team of all-time by baseball historians.|$|E

He had verbally agreed a new four-year deal with West Ham in May 2007, only to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the agreement {{in a bid}} to move to Liverpool. The controversy was heightened on 10 July when the Israeli media reported that Benayoun's agent, Ronen Katsav, had agreed a deal with Liverpool which would mean Benayoun taking a lower pay than the £50,000 a week offered by West Ham in May. On 12 July, Liverpool reported on their official website that the signing of Yossi Benayoun had been completed a £5 million deal with him signing a four-year contract.|$|E

Pacha arrives to rescue him, and extends his offer. Kuzco accepts Pacha's help, though secretly plans to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> his word once he is safe.

25|$|In the {{original}} Hellraiser (1987), Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman) escapes from the Cenobites when his brother Larry (Andrew Robinson) spills {{his own blood}} on the spot where Frank died opening a puzzle box that opened a gateway to the Cenobites. With the help of Larry's wife Julia (Clare Higgins), Frank begins regenerating his body {{with the blood of}} victims that Julia supplies him. Larry's daughter, Kirsty (Ashley Laurence), accidentally unleashes the Cenobites, but makes a deal to deliver Frank to them in exchange for her own life. After taking Frank, the Cenobites <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> their deal and try and take Kirsty as well. Solving the puzzle box, Kirsty sends the Cenobites back to Hell.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the real}} {{beneficiaries}} of the conflict were the Japanese. They were able to expand their influence in both Thailand and Indochina. The Japanese intention was to use Thailand and Indochina as their military bases to invade Burma and Malaya in the future. The Japanese won from Phibun a secret verbal promise to support them in an attack on British Malaya and British Burma (though he later would <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> his word). Relations between Japan and Thailand subsequently stressed as disappointed Phibun switched to courting the British and Americans {{in the hopes of}} warding off what he saw as an imminent Japanese invasion. However on 8 December 1941, the Japanese invaded Thailand {{at the same time they}} invaded Malaya (immediately before the attack on Pearl Harbor because of the International Date Line. Pearl Harbor was attacked one and a half hours after Malaya and Thailand).|$|E
25|$|Despite losing {{almost a}} third of its strength, once Lord Robert's {{operations}} began to succeed, the Boer reaction allowed the 12th Brigade, and the 2nd Wilts, to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the offensive against the Boer Republics. Although a part of the Sixth Division, the brigade did not take part in the ill-fated attack on Bloody Sunday during the Battle of Paardeberg. Instead, the Wilts was tasked with guarding Bloemfontein and Kroonstad. Eventually, the 12th Brigade was ordered to move in conjunction with another independent brigade and capture the town of Bethlehem, where Christiaan de Wet's commando was operating from. Although the town was taken, De Wet escaped. Pausing to resupply, Clemments' brigade attempted to destroy De Wet's commando at the Battle of Slabbert's Nek (2324 July 1900). With the Royal Irish Regiment, two companies of the 2nd Wilts conducted a night assault up the Nek, capturing the ridge overlooking the Boer position. Although they cleared the Nek, taking 4000 prisoners, the British forces had not been in time to capture De Wet and some his commando, who managed to escape to the mountains.|$|E
25|$|In September 2012 Chrysler {{temporarily}} suspended {{a demonstration}} {{program that was}} conducting with 109 Dodge Ram 1500 Plug-in Hybrids and 23 Chrysler Town & Country plug-in hybrids. All units deployed in the program were recalled due to damage sustained by three separate pickup trucks when their 12.9 kWh battery packs overheated. The carmaker plans to upgrade the battery packs with cells that use a different lithium-ion chemistry before the vehicles <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> service. Chrysler explained {{that no one was}} injured from any of the incidents, and the vehicles were not occupied at the time, nor any of the minivans were involved in any incident, but they were withdrawn as a precaution. The carmaker reported that the demonstration fleet had collectively accumulated 1.3 million miles (2.1 million km) before the vehicles were recalled. The demonstration is a program jointly funded by Chrysler and the U.S. Department of Energy that includes the first-ever factory-produced vehicles capable of reverse power flow. The experimental system would allow fleet operators to use their plug-in hybrids to supply electricity for a building during a power outage, reduce power usage when electric rates are high or even sell electricity back to their utility company.|$|E

25|$|In the Uttara Kanda of Valmiki's Ramayana, Durvasa {{appears at}} Rama's {{doorstep}} and seeing Lakshmana guarding the door, demands {{an audience with}} Rama. At the time, Rama was having a private conversation with Yama(the god of death) disguised as an ascetic. Before the conversation began, Yama gave Rama strict instructions that their dialogue was to remain confidential and anyone who entered the room and saw or heard them was to be executed. Rama agreed and entrusted Lakshman with the duty of guarding his door and fulfilling his promise to Yama. Thus, when Durvasa made his demand, Lakshman politely asked the sage to wait until Rama had finished his meeting. The sage grew angry and threatened to curse all of Ayodhya if Lakshman did not immediately inform Rama of his arrival. Lakshman, in a dilemma, {{decided it would be}} better that he alone die to save all of Ayodhya from falling under Durvasa's curse and so interrupted Rama's meeting to inform him of the sage's arrival. Rama quickly concluded his meeting with Yama and received the sage with due courtesy. Durvasa told Rama of his desire to be fed and Rama fulfilled his guest's request, whereupon the satisfied sage went on his way. Rama was overcome with sorrow, for {{he did not want to}} kill his beloved brother, Lakshman. Still, he had given his word to Yama and could not <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> it. He called his advisers to help him resolve this quandary. On Vasishta's advice, he ordered Lakshman to leave him for good, since such abandonment was equivalent to death as far as the pious were concerned. Lakshman then went to the banks of the Sarayu, resolved on giving up the world through Yoga.|$|E

Robert attempted to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> his deal with Henry and re-appropriate the county, but Henry's grip was already sufficiently firm to prevent this. Robert's rule of the Duchy was chaotic, and parts of Henry's lands became almost independent of central control from Rouen.|$|E
