Some {{experimental results}} <b>in</b> <b>compression</b> and bending, where local buckling of the <b>flanges</b> <b>in</b> <b>compression</b> occurred, are described {{and the critical}} stresses are summarized. A numerical model by the finite element method (FEM) is introduced and validated by comparison of the numerical results with the experimental ones. This finite element model is applied for a wide parametric analysis in order to individuate a buckling curve for the local buckling of the flange. An analytical expression of the buckling curve is developed, taking into consideration the orthotropy of the material, in which the restraint action of the web on the flange is explicitly introduced {{as a function of}} the geometrical and mechanical data of the section sub-components. The reliability of the proposed curve as a design tool is confirmed by comparison with the experimental results. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Seven remediation techniques were investigated initially, and remediation effectiveness was evaluated based on strength, stiffness, and ease of installation/cost. The oriented strand board (OSB) collar remediation worked very well and returned 8 out of 12 series of joists to a strength statistically equivalent to the “No Hole” condition.

40|$|Six welded H-section steel {{specimens}} {{subjected to}} the axial compressive load, the in-plane shear force and the resulting bending moment around the cross-section major axis are tested monotonically to investigate the elasto-plastic interactive buckling performances of beam-columns. The specimens are designed to fail due to local interactive buckling which is monitored by strain gauges and displacement meters. Strain curves and displacement curves varying with the shear force are illustrated, based on which the local interactive buckling is identified and the ultimate moment capacity of the specimen is extracted. The tests reveal that the local buckling of the web and <b>flange</b> <b>in</b> the <b>compression</b> zone occurs simultaneously resulting in the decrease of the ultimate moment capacity of the specimen. The normalized moment versus rotation curves are illustrated and compared in pairs to investigate {{the effects of the}} axial compression ratio, the flange width-thickness ratio and the web height-thickness ratio on the normalized ultimate moment capacity, which is defined as the ratio of the ultimate moment over the plastic moment. It is observed that the normalized ultimate moment capacity decreases remarkably as the axial compression ratio or the flange width-thickness ratio increases, but varies little as the web height-thickness ratio increases...|$|R
40|$|Cold-formed steel hollow flange {{sections}} are structurally efficient {{compared to}} the conventional open channel sections. They can be of different forms including hollow flange I- and channel sections, which are generally fabricated by first cold-forming a single sheet to form the desired shape and then connecting their flange and web elements by continuous welding. Instead of welding, intermittently screw/rivet fastened or spot welded connection can also be used. A detailed investigation is currently under way on the structural performance characteristics of such intermittently screw/rivet fastened steel hollow flange sections. This paper presents the details of an experimental study performed to investigate the behaviour of built-up cold-formed steel hollow <b>flange</b> sections <b>in</b> <b>compression,</b> where more than 45 stub columns were tested. Both hollow flange I- and channel sections built-up using either single steel sheet or three steel elements were tested. Tests also included built-up hollow flange channel sections with stiffened web elements. Test results including the failure loads, load versus axial deformation plots and failure characteristics are presented in this paper. Test failure loads are compared with the predictions based on both effective width and direct strength methods to verify their adequacy in predicting the section compression capacity of built-up hollow flange sections. This paper has shown that although hollow flange I-sections made of three elements with a 100 mm fastener spacing can perform similar to continuously welded sections, hollow flange channel sections undergo premature failures even with a 50 mm fastener spacing, and the reasons are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 The {{objective}} of this project was to evaluate methods to remediate a wood I-joist with a single, circular hole in the web while leaving utilities in place. The methods were experimentally evaluated with a full-scale bending test using four equally spaced point loads. There were three depths of joists with varying flange widths and two span lengths (4. 88 m & 2. 44 m). Failure modes for the long span joists without holes were <b>in</b> the <b>flanges</b> <b>in</b> either tension, <b>compression</b> or lateral buckling; but once a hole was introduced the majority were classified as shear failures. Effectiveness of the remediation was evaluated based on three criteria: strength, stiffness, and ease of installation/cost. The OSB collar patch was effective for 8 out of the 12 series tested. A maximum reduction of load from a joist with no hole to one with a hole was 49 % for the long span and 58 % for the short span. The OSB collar was not as effective in returning stiffness to the joists, but was easier to install and less expensive than the LSL patch...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the {{investigation}} presented is the characterisation of the nonlinear cyclic behaviour of steel joints between I profile beams to hollow section columns with welded reverse channel. When compared with other steel shapes, tubular profiles show a privileged structural behaviour due {{to their ability to}} withstand axial loads, bending in several directions and torsion, besides considerable advantages in terms of maintenance and aesthetics. The welded reverse channel connection is a good solution since it allows for a bolted joint between I beam to hollow column. Furthermore, this type of joint detail has a reasonable construction cost, is easy to implement and possesses large ductility through the deformation of the web panel. In this paper a comparison is made between experimental and numerical finite element model results. The main focus will be on the results concerning the main components of the reverse channel, i. e. web face <b>in</b> bending, <b>flanges</b> panels <b>in</b> shear, <b>compression</b> and tension. The main objective of these tests is determining the strength, stiffness and rotation capacity of the main components of the reverse channel joining detail. In the experimental program the characteristics of the nonlinear behaviour of the principal reverse channel components is assessed by means of bending tests (monotonic and cyclic). The parameters which have been varied in the tests are the geometry of the loaded area and the dimensions of the flanges and web of the U shaped element.

40|$|AbstractThis {{article is}} {{continuation}} of earlier {{work of the}} author. Apractical method for cross-section strength calculation of flexural reinforced concrete members with rectangular compression zone using curvilinear concrete stress-strain diagrams of Eurocode 2 (EN- 2) is presented in this article. The method {{can be used for}} strength calculation of members with <b>flanges</b> and reinforcement <b>in</b> <b>compression</b> zone as well. Curvilinear EN- 2 stress diagrams are readily superseded by polynomials that can be easily integrated are proposed by the author. It gives opportunity for mathematically accurate, without changing of curvilinear diagram by arbitrary diagrams, determination of value and location for resultant of concrete compression zone stresses and location of neutral axes as well. Calculation is performed for any chosen strain of the layer subjected to the maximum compression. The said strain may be of greater or less value in comparison to that corresponding to the concrete strength. In this way the maximum strength of the member can be estimated when the compression zone strain value varies within chosen interval. The method is suitable in both cases for the members which are commonly (not abundantly) and abundantly reinforced if the neutral axes is located within the cross-section, i. e. within the interval up to the centre of the tensile reinforcement cross-sectional area. Strength of members reinforced with high strength reinforcement which is not sufficiently prestressed or not prestressed at all can be determined by calculation. Formulae can be used for calculation of stress-strain state in persistent situations (not ultimate ones) and for calculation of steel prestress value as well. Rectangular compression zone parameters required for member strength calculation using curvilinear stress diagram are presented in the article. Results obtained by the proposed method are compared with the results obtained using EN- 2 formulae...|$|R
