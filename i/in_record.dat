5|$|At each venue, {{the concert}} {{was treated as}} a major event by the local press and {{attended}} by between ten and twenty thousand fans, whose enthusiastic response to the Beatles produced sound levels that left the music only semi-audible. The tour earned the Beatles over a million dollars in ticket sales. It also stimulated a further increase <b>in</b> <b>record</b> sales, and resulted in the sale of a considerable quantity of Beatle-related merchandise.|$|E

5|$|The 2007 Midwest flooding, which {{affected}} the hilly Driftless area of southeast Minnesota {{was the result}} of a training pattern of storms mixing warm moist air from Tropical Storm Erin with cooler Canadian air, resulting <b>in</b> <b>record</b> 24-hour rainfall totals of up to , with a similar flooding event in 2010 as a result of the remnants of tropical storm Georgette in the eastern Pacific and Hurricane Karl in the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E

5|$|After {{attaining}} peak intensity, Hurricane Ramon {{began to}} weaken. Late on October10, Ramon weakened slightly while turning northwest. The following morning, the storm reportedly weakened into a Category 2. Hurricane Ramon began to rapidly deteriorate {{due to a}} combination of jetstream interactions and increasingly cold sea-surface temperatures. At 0600UTC on October11, the storm was downgraded into a Category1 on the SSHWS after bypassing the Category2 stage. It weakened into a tropical storm later that day and was further downgraded to a tropical depression on October12. Tropical Depression Ramon dissipated on 0600UTC that day. The remnant moisture of this hurricane later moved into Southern California, resulting <b>in</b> <b>record</b> rains.|$|E
40|$|The quality {{standard}} <b>in</b> <b>records</b> management depends on proficiency not only <b>in</b> <b>records</b> management {{but also in}} the business operations that comprise the mission of the organization. In a quality environment, operating without a records management program could result in loss of business, erosion of customer confidence and non-compliance. Records are being neglected, ill managed and destroyed at an alarming rate. It is hoped that by incorporating quality <b>in</b> <b>records</b> management, proper procedures are abided and a quality document management system can be established in compliance with ISO 9000.

5|$|As well as {{providing}} thematic consistency with the original, {{the repetition of}} iconography also acted as a vital marketing tool. The marketing of the album was documented in an episode of the 1995 BBC television programme The Music Biz. Executives at Virgin Records {{thought that this was}} important to attract the target audience, who they believed no longer spent much time <b>in</b> <b>record</b> shops. They felt that similarities to the design of the first album, including Meat Loaf's name in Gothic typography, would entice consumers of the 1977 album to purchase this.The section from this episode about the marketing of Bat Out of Hell II, and the filming of this music video, has been reshown as part of BBC Learning Zone's media studies strand.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1964, {{however, the}} Kingston Trio's {{dominance}} <b>in</b> <b>record</b> sales and concert bookings began to wane, due partly to imitators in the pop-folk world {{and also to}} the rise of other commercial folk groups like Peter, Paul and Mary. The British Invasion spearheaded by The Beatles, who were signed by EMI/Capitol just as the Trio's seven-year contract was running out, depressed sales of acoustic folk albums significantly, and Capitol did not make a serious effort to re-sign the group. Werber secured a generous signing bonus from Decca Records, and the last four albums of the Kingston Trio's first decade were released by that label. Without the production facilities of Capitol, however, and the expertise of Voyle Gilmore and engineer Pete Abbott, the Decca releases lacked the aural brilliance of the Capitol albums, and none of the four sold especially well.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola {{was lucky}} to escape from a crash in the Masaryk Grand Prix. He and Chiron were chasing Fagioli when Fagioli crashed into a wooden footbridge, {{bringing}} it crashing down onto the road. Caracciola and Chiron drove into a ditch {{at the side of}} the road to avoid the debris; while Chiron drove out of the ditch and was able to continue, Caracciola drove into a tree and retired. Despite this accident, Caracciola again performed strongly in the Hillclimbing Championship; he won eight climbs in his SSKL to take the title. Perhaps his most significant achievement of 1931 was his win in the Mille Miglia. The local fleet of Alfa Romeos battled for the lead early in the race, but when they fell back Caracciola was able to take control. His win, <b>in</b> <b>record</b> time, made him and his co-driver Wilhelm Sebastian (who allowed Caracciola to drive the entire race) the first foreigners to win the Italian race. The only other foreigners to win the race on the full course were Stirling Moss and Denis Jenkinson in 1955.|$|E

40|$|Background: Physicians' {{adherence}} to cardiovascular (CV) guidelines {{has been found}} to be poor. In this regard, accuracy <b>in</b> keeping medical <b>records</b> could play an important role. This study was devised to describe which data are present <b>in</b> medical <b>records</b> from a large sample of physicians and to investigate the association and the link between completeness <b>in</b> <b>recording</b> and clinical appropriateness. Methods The data extracted from medical records of 1078 doctors (general practitioners, cardiologists, and diabetologists) were analyzed, with a focus on CV prevention. The percentage of recorded data of several CV clinical variables was calculated. A multivariate analysis was performed to investigate the association between doctors' and patients' characteristics and different patterns <b>in</b> <b>recording.</b> Finally, the completeness <b>in</b> <b>recording</b> was calculated with a score and plotted against three indicators of appropriateness. Results: The only risk factor that achieved a good standard of registration was blood pressure (89 %). Low-density lipoprotein and waist circumference were largely under-recorded, whereas lifestyle data collection was almost negligible. Age, specialization, and use of electronic records increase the accuracy <b>in</b> <b>recording.</b> When one CV risk factor was predominant, the probability of having other risk factors recorded was reduced. A significant increase in the proportion of patients treated according to guidelines was found in doctors who were more accurate <b>in</b> <b>recording.</b> Conclusion: A link exists between accuracy <b>in</b> <b>recording</b> with both quality of care and {{adherence to}} guidelines. Specific training of all doctors in this field should be considered...|$|R

5|$|Early {{use of the}} NS-10 among {{engineers}} include Bob Clearmountain, Rhett Davies, and Bill Scheniman in the US, and Nigel Jopson in the UK. Clearmountain, then {{a rising}} star <b>in</b> <b>record</b> production, is often credited for {{the popularity of the}} NS-10; Phil Ward, writing in Sound on Sound, suggested that Clearmountain was probably not the earliest, but was certainly the most influential early adopter. It became a legend that Clearmountain had chosen it because it was the worst speaker he could find. He was one of a new breed of creative freelance recording engineers and producers who would travel from studio to studio equipped with their own gear that included microphones, and a pair of Yamaha NS-10, as a reference.|$|E

5|$|In May 1871, Grant ordered {{federal troops}} to help marshals in arresting Klansmen. That October, Grant {{suspended}} habeas corpus {{in part of}} South Carolina and sent federal troops {{to enforce the law}} there. After prosecutions by Akerman and his replacement, George Henry Williams, the Klan's power collapsed; by 1872, elections in the South saw African Americans voting <b>in</b> <b>record</b> numbers. That same year, Grant signed the Amnesty Act, which restored political rights to former Confederates. Lacking sufficient funding, the Justice Department stopped prosecutions of the Klan in June 1873; civil rights prosecutions continued throughout Grant's second term but with fewer yearly cases and convictions. Additionally, Grant's Postmaster General John Creswell, using his patronage powers, integrated the postal system and appointed African American postmasters across the nation.|$|E
5|$|In the south-central United States, the {{remnants}} of Paine dropped moderate to heavy rainfall in regions that already received above normal rainfall. Isolated locations in Texas, northern Oklahoma, and southeastern Kansas received over 10inches (25.4cm) of precipitation, and the highest total in the United States was 11.35inches (28.8cm) at Fort Scott, Kansas. Moderate rainfall extended northeastward through Missouri and Illinois. In Barnsdall, Oklahoma, a station recorded 10.42inches (26.5cm) on September 29, which was the highest daily precipitation for any station in the state. In combination with previous storms, some locations received over 20inches of rainfall in an 8-day period, which produced severe river flooding along the Osage and Arkansas Rivers. The flooding resulted <b>in</b> <b>record</b> discharge rates along many streams and creeks, while many reservoirs were nearly filled to capacity. The Mississippi River in St. Louis reached the fifth highest flood stage on record.|$|E

The album did not exceed the {{expectations}} of Ocean Avenue, which approached 2million <b>in</b> <b>record</b> sales. Internationally, Lights and Sounds peaked at number four on the Canadian Top Album Chart, making it Yellowcard's highest debut in Canada. It also debuted at number six in the Australian chart, in which it spent six weeks, before retiring in the number 49 position. In the New Zealand chart it peaked in the number 11 position. Lights and Sounds charted on the number 59 spot in the United Kingdom and spent one week on the chart.

Designers distanced the Commodore further away from its Opel origins, by smoothing the lines of the outer body and incorporating a subtle tail spoiler. A thorough redesign of the nose saw the Commodore gain sleek, narrow headlamps and a shallower grille, while the Calais specification employed unique partially concealed headlamps.|$|E

5|$|Tour dates {{were limited}} to cities in Europe and North America. This {{decision}} caused some resentment among fans {{in other parts of}} the world. Drowned World became the first (and only) Madonna tour to skip over Canada completely. For many weeks prior to the launch of the tour dates, Arthur Fogel from Live Nation himself attempted to book dates in Toronto at the Air Canada Centre between the Sunrise, Atlanta, and Detroit dates, though no free bookings were available. In the end no dates were scheduled in Toronto, to the disappointment of many Canadian fans. Ticket sales were swift in London on April 25, as Madonna sold out her dates at Earls Court Exhibition Centre <b>in</b> <b>record</b> time– six shows in six hours.
