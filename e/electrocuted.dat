5|$|The episode {{opens in}} Dr. Connors's laboratory, where Connors {{demonstrates}} to his interns Peter and Gwen a new {{potential source of}} clean energy: genetically modified eels. After Gwen and Peter leave, an electrician, Max Dillon, attempts to upgrade the lab's electrical filters, but gets <b>electrocuted</b> and {{is sent to the}} hospital. There, he is found to be emitting strong electrical fields and is placed in quarantine. Max is further angered when a doctor explains that, although he is stable, he must wear a special suit to contain this emitted bioelectricity.|$|E
5|$|The first Philippine provinces to be {{impacted}} by the typhoon were Albay and Catanduanes, which suffered power outages after strong winds tore down power lines. One person was killed in Virac, Catanduanes after being <b>electrocuted</b> by a felled power line. In order to prevent more widespread outages, electrical service in some locations was deliberately shut down. Landslides triggered by Nanmadol in Aurora killed 25people. On the Bicol Peninsula, eight fatalities occurred due to drowning, electrocution, or hypothermia.|$|E

5|$|Well-executed {{evacuations}} and warnings {{limited the}} death toll to six, while damage amounted to $305.8million (1998USD, $409.8million 2009USD). In addition to the six human lives lost, 497 heads of cattle and 21,387 chickens were killed. All six human deaths were indirectly related to Georges; the first death occurred when an 61-year-old woman stepped on a downed wire and was electrocuted; the second occurred when a 56-year-old man drove over another downed wire on his motorcycle and was <b>electrocuted.</b>|$|E
5|$|About 80% of Manila's 7 million {{residents}} lost power {{due to the}} storm. Low-lying areas of Manila were underwater as strong winds blew away roofs of shacks and uprooted trees. Throughout the city, four deaths happened. One man was <b>electrocuted</b> while another man was crushed by debris. Fifty people were confirmed to have died and 2,089 dwellings were damaged in nearby Bataan after storm surge crashed into the area. Most of the casualties in Bataan were due to drownings; the city was also the hardest hit by the storm. Throughout the area near Bataan, 10 villages were destroyed. In Pantalan Luma, all but four of the town's 400 huts were destroyed.|$|E
40|$|Background Plasmodium knowlesi {{is found}} in macaques {{and is the only}} major {{zoonotic}} malaria to affect humans. Transmission of P. knowlesi between people and macaques depends on the host species preferences and feeding behavior of mosquito vectors. However, these behaviours are difficult to measure {{due to the lack of}} standardized methods for sampling potential vectors attracted to different host species. This study evaluated <b>electrocuting</b> net traps as a safe, standardised method for sampling P. knowlesi vectors attracted to human and macaque hosts. Field experiments were conducted within a major focus on P. knowlesi transmission in Malaysian Borneo to compare the performance of human (HENET) or macaque (MENET) odour-baited <b>electrocuting</b> nets, human landing catches (HLC) and monkey-baited traps (MBT) for sampling mosquitoes. The abundance and diversity of Anopheles sampled by different methods were compared over 40 nights, with a focus on the P. knowlesi vector Anopheles balabancensis. Results HLC caught more An. balabacensis than any other method (3. 6 per night). In contrast, no An. balabacensis were collected in MBT collections, which generally performed poorly for all mosquito taxa. Anopheles vector species including An. balabacensis were sampled in both HENET and MENET collections, but at a mean abundance of less than 1 per night. There was no difference between HENET and MENET in the overall abundance (P = 0. 05) or proportion (P = 0. 7) of An. balabacensis. The estimated diversity of Anopheles species was marginally higher in <b>electrocuting</b> net than HLC collections, and similar in collections made with humans or monkey hosts. Conclusions Host-baited <b>electrocuting</b> nets had moderate success for sampling known zoonotic malaria vectors. The primary vector An. balabacensis was collected with <b>electrocuting</b> nets baited both with humans and macaques, but at a considerably lower density than the HLC standard. However, <b>electrocuting</b> nets were considerably more successful than monkey-baited traps and representatively characterised anopheline species diversity. Consequently, their use allows inferences about relative mosquito attraction to be meaningfully interpreted while eliminating confounding factors due to trapping method. On this basis, <b>electrocuting</b> net traps should be considered as a useful standardised method for investigating vector contact with humans and wildlife reservoirs...|$|R
