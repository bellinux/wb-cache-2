None of the methyl esters in airtight drums deteriorated during eighteen months of storage; composition, viscosities and free fatty acid levels remained unchanged.

However, oxidation can be delayed by the presence of tocopherols (natural antioxidants) in the methyl ester, and it can be further delayed by the presence of an unidentified carotenoid. The exceptional stability of rapeseed methyl ester seems to be due to a combination of relatively high levels of Μ-tocopherol and the unidentified carotenoid.
