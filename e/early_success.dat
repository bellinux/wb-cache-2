5|$|An <b>early</b> <b>success</b> {{story in}} the 1950s was the saving of the nene (or Hawaiian goose) from extinction. Birds {{were brought to the}} site and {{breeding}} at Slimbridge was successful. Initial releases into the wild in Hawaii were a failure however, because the nene's natural habitat was not protected from the predators that had been introduced to the islands by man. Once that problem was alleviated, successful reintroduction became possible.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>early</b> <b>success,</b> the series, {{along with}} the overall rhythm game genre, {{suffered}} from poor sales starting in 2009. Company spokesman Eric Hollreiser said consumer research suggested continued solid demand for the series. Still, by early 2011, Activision stated that the series was on hiatus for 2011, while a seventh main title in the series was under development; this title was later cancelled due to the poor quality of the emerging product. Activision later shut down sales of the series' downloadable content, although users who purchased material from it previously may still play what they bought.|$|E

5|$|ETNC's <b>early</b> <b>success</b> also {{attracted}} the attention of other communities in North Texas, and in 1904 Denison attempted to entice Mayo to relocate the college there for a considerable amount of financial aid. Whether or not Mayo seriously considered the offer is unknown, but he was able to use it as leverage to persuade Commerce to give the college $30,000 {{over the next three years}} for the promise that it would remain, money that was mostly used to renovate and expand ETNC's physical plant.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Nine Inch Nails {{began the}} Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series, {{in which they}} toured North America as an opening act for {{alternative}} rock artists such as Peter Murphy and The Jesus and Mary Chain.

In July 1912, he defeated Rube Marquard, ending Marquard's consecutive win streak at 19 games, which at the time tied the record for the longest win streak for a pitcher in MLB history. Lavender's <b>early</b> <b>success</b> as a rookie soon turned to mediocrity as his career progressed, winning no more than 11 games in any season afterward. On August 31, 1915, he threw a no-hitter against the New York Giants.|$|E

5|$|The Toronto Argonauts {{currently}} {{lead the}} Canadian Football League in total wins and in winning percentage in the Grey Cup. <b>Early</b> <b>success</b> {{in the final}} can partly {{be attributed to the}} weakness of western teams: between 1921 and 1952 the Argonauts won in nine straight appearances, including six straight against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. The team's success is not merely an historical aberration, however: they have won six of their nine appearances since the formation of the CFL, including their last five straight.|$|E
5|$|The Votadini, who {{occupied}} the south-east of Scotland, came under Roman sway {{at an early}} stage and Cerialis sent one division north through their territory to the shores of the Firth of Forth.
