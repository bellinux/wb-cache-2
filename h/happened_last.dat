25|$|Montag awakens ill {{the next}} morning, with Mildred nagging {{him to get}} up and go to work. As Mildred tries to care for her husband (but finds herself more {{involved}} in the parlor wall entertainment in the next room), Montag suggests that maybe he should take a break from being a fireman after what <b>happened</b> <b>last</b> night. Mildred panics over the thought of losing the house and her parlor wall family and angrily blames the old woman who killed herself over her books for Montag's change of heart over his job. Captain Beatty, Montag's fire chief, personally visits Montag to see how he is doing. Sensing Montag's concerns, Beatty recounts how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in: over the course of several decades, people embraced new media (in this case, film and television), sports, and a quickening pace of life. Books were ruthlessly abridged or degraded to accommodate a short attention span while minority groups protested over the controversial, outdated content perceived to be found in literature (yet comic books, trade papers, and sex magazines were allowed to stay, as those fed into the population's want for mindless entertainment). The government took advantage of this by turning the firemen into officers of people's peace of mind. Beatty adds casually that all firemen eventually steal a book out of curiosity; if the book is burned within 24 hours, the fireman and his family will not get in trouble.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{returned}} to Maryland for the 2010 season {{to increase his}} NFL draft stock, complete his criminology and criminal justice degree in December, and improve the team's record from a 2–10 finish the year prior. He said, [...] "I'll have the same talk with the same people [...] But my focus is to change what <b>happened</b> <b>last</b> year." [...] Prior {{to the start of}} the season, the coaching staff planned to increase Smith's efficiency by playing him fewer snaps in an attempt to keep him fresh. In the Red–White spring game, Smith accounted for 90of starting quarterback Jamarr Robinson's 146passing yards, including a [...] "fingertip catch in the end zone" [...] on the opening drive, and the two roommates were reported to have developed a good rapport. Before the season, Smith was named to the watchlists for the Paul Hornung Award and Biletnikoff Award.|$|E
500|$|Lamont {{has said}} that Labour lost the 2011 Scottish Parliament {{election}} because the party lost its direction, and that having failed to recognise the 2007 result as a defeat, it picked up the wrong signals from the 2010 general election that saw a strong Scottish Labour vote at Westminster. In February 2012 she told the Times Educational Supplement, [...] "We misread the 2010 (general) election, thinking it was confirmation that Scotland was a Labour country– it was probably confirmation that Scotland was still anti-Tory. There's an issue about rebuilding trust, and our confidence in the values that brought us into politics." [...] She told delegates at her party's 2012 Scottish conference {{that it was time}} for them to stop apologising for past mistakes. [...] "We know what <b>happened</b> <b>last</b> May – we looked tired and complacent and we got the kind of beating we deserved. But now, we need to start building the kind of Scottish Labour Party which Scotland deserves and which Scotland needs." ...|$|E

I don't have that information. But in general, our people take great care in making {{decisions}} based on the information that they have at the time. Premier Shawn Graham said [...] "I just want to extend sympathies to the affected families. This is a tragic situation for the community of Bathurst and our province." [...] Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper said the incident had [...] "shocked the nation" [...] and called for a day of mourning. Valery Vienneau, Bishop of Bathurst, read a message on behalf of Pope Benedict XVI stating: [...] " [...] expresses sentiments of deep sympathy and spiritual closeness to the members of their families and to all staff and students who have been touched by this tragedy. The Pope assures all concerned of his prayers for those who died and for their families." ...|$|E
500|$|In May, Benfica {{had four}} matches to gain four points on Sporting. The first {{was at the}} Estádio da Madeira with Nacional. Knowing that Sporting had lost points to Académica, Benfica hoped to narrow the gsp between them to two points. After an uneventful first half, in the 56th minute Nenê scored the opening goal for Nacional. Eight minutes later, Rúben Micael {{extended}} the lead, with Reyes reducing it in the 67th minute. Benfica pressed unsuccessfully for the equaliser before Nacional scored again with Miguel Fidalgo. Sánchez Flores realised that winning the league title was now impossible. On 9 May, Benfica met Trofense at home. Valdomiro scored first for the visitors in the 31st minute before Benfica scored twice in two minutes, reaching half-time with a 2–1 lead. In the second half, Paulinho tied the score for Trofense. Sporting won that day, so Benfica trailed by seven points with two match days left and could not qualify for the Champions League. Sánchez Flores said, [...] "I know when to arrive and when to leave. I {{do not want to}} be a problem for the club." [...] Playing out the schedule, Benfica first visited the Municipal de Braga. They won 3–1, ending a five-year winless streak there. The victory was against Jorge Jesus, widely reported as Sánchez Flores' successor. A week later, Benfica ended their campaign with a 3–1 win against Belenenses. Sánchez Flores analysed the club's season: [...] "They asked me to improve the team and I did. But we all know what <b>happened</b> <b>last</b> year; we should set realistic goals. Second place was possible, but we failed in the final third. I won a title and fought for another." [...] A short time later, he and the club terminated his contract.|$|E

Chakrabortty stated that [...] "those dozens of Grenfell residents didn’t die: they were killed. What <b>happened</b> <b>last</b> week wasn’t a “terrible tragedy” or some other studio-sofa platitude: it was social murder [...] [...] [...] Over 170 years later, Britain remains a country that murders its poor." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{rough cut}} of Dune without {{post-production}} effects ran over four hours long but Lynch's intended {{cut of the}} film (as reflected in the seventh and final draft of the script) was almost three hours long. Universal and the film's financiers expected a standard, two-hour cut of the film. Dino de Laurentiis, his daughter Raffaella and Lynch excised numerous scenes, filmed new scenes that simplified or concentrated plot elements and added voice-over narrations, plus a new introduction by Virginia Madsen. Contrary to rumor, Lynch made no other version besides the theatrical cut. A TV version was aired in 1988 in two parts totalling 186 minutes including a [...] "What <b>happened</b> <b>last</b> night" [...] recap and second credit roll. Lynch disavowed this version and had his name removed from the credits, Alan Smithee being credited instead. This version (without recap and second credit roll) has occasionally been released on DVD as 'Dune: Extended Edition'. Several longer versions have been spliced together. Although Universal has approached Lynch for a possible director's cut, Lynch has declined every offer and prefers not to discuss Dune in interviews.|$|E

2500|$|Vikernes {{was arrested}} on 19 August 1993 in Bergen. The police found 150kg of {{explosives}} and 3,000 rounds of ammunition in his home. According to Jeffrey Kaplan in his book Encyclopedia of White Power, Vikernes [...] "intended to blow up Blitz House, the radical leftist and anarchist enclave in Oslo", a plan which [...] "was reportedly {{on the verge of}} execution." [...] In an article originally published in 1999, Kevin Coogan also mentioned Vikernes' alleged intent to [...] "destroy an Oslo-based punk anti-fascist squat called Blitz House," [...] and stated [...] "Vikernes may have felt that {{he had no choice but}} to kill Euronymous before bombing Blitz House because 'the Communist' would almost certainly have opposed such an act." [...] Vikernes denied these claims in a 2009 interview, stating [...] "I was getting [...] in order to defend Norway if we were attacked any time. During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union could have decided to attack us. We have no reason to trust neither the government, the royal family or the military because of what <b>happened</b> <b>last</b> time we were attacked. We are left to ourselves." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cyril Connolly's {{short story}} [...] "Bond Strikes Camp" [...] first {{appeared}} in the April 1963 issue of The London Magazine. Although a parody, the story clearly mentions Bond by name and code number. An expensive, privately printed edition of only fifty copies was done for the Shenval Press in 1963. Soon after, the story appeared in Connolly's miscellany collection Previous Convictions. Author, critic and Bond author Kingsley Amis compared the story unfavourably to The Harvard Lampoon spoof Bond novel Alligator by claiming that [...] "Parodies have their laughter-value, but the laughter is partly affectionate, and the successful parodist is moved partly by wanting to write like his original by wishing he'd thought of doing so first. Mr Cyril Connolly no doubt doesn't wish this in regard to Mr Fleming; his 'Bond Strikes Camp', in which M orders Bond to dress up as a woman, ostensibly for purposes of espionage, and then tries to get him into bed, is much too far from the original, never catches the note, gets elementary details wrong. E.g. M is made to call Bond 'Bond'. This <b>happened</b> <b>last</b> in 1954 (Live and Let Die, ch. 2). Every Fleming fan knows it's either 'James' or '007'." ...|$|E
2500|$|National {{media outlets}} {{reported}} on an exchange between judge Harry Connick Jr. and contestant Quentin Alexander noting the incident of Connick scolding a contestant was awkward. On the live airing of the Top 6 show, there was three contestants {{who had not}} been saved when Alexander was chosen. After he performed, host Ryan Seacrest noted that he appeared to be upset. When asked Alexander responded [...] "This sucks, We've got two of the best vocalists, my best friend [...] sitting over there. This whole thing is whack, but I'm going to shut up right now." [...] Seacrest then replied saying that this is a competition, and with the save anything could happen. When Alexander had left the stage, Connick Jr. said, [...] "Quentin, if it's that whack, then you can always go home, because Idol is paying {{a lot of money to}} give you this experience and for you to say that to this hand that is feeding you right now, I think is highly disrespectful." [...] Alexander was then prompted by the producers to return to the stage where he approached the judges and clarified he meant the two being potentially eliminated was whack, not the show, or the experience. Later, after performing his second song, he explained [...] "I understand that these things are going to happen, and I just didn't want my friend to leave" [...] and apologized. Judge Jennifer Lopez empathized with Alexander's emotions running high but said that as an artist he had to learn to work through that even when it happens to put on the performance. Joey Cook commented after being eliminated on Alexander's statements: I pretty much just told him what he did was beautiful, in my opinion, and it was the perfect representation of him. Quentin is a very emotional person. He’s very 'all cards on the table.' There is no sugar coating. He doesn’t hide his emotions. He’s honest. He’s a raw human being, and I think what <b>happened</b> <b>last</b> night was the perfect example of that and how emotional of a person he is.|$|E
