5|$|LGBT {{themes in}} {{speculative}} fiction {{refer to the}} incorporation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) themes into science fiction, fantasy, horror fiction and related genres.

Sculpted by Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser, the medals recognize those immigrants' Viking heritage, depicting a warrior of that culture on the obverse and his vessel on the reverse. The medals also recall the early Viking <b>explorations</b> <b>of</b> North America.|$|E

5|$|The first {{foreigner}} {{to arrive}} at Hawaii was James Cook in 1778. The first non-native to observe Kīlauea in detail was William Ellis, an English missionary who in 1823 spent {{more than two weeks}} trekking across the volcano.

5|$|The late 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries {{were marked by}} the {{establishment}} of tropical botanical gardens {{as a tool of}} colonial expansion (for trade and commerce and, secondarily, science) mainly by the British and Dutch, in India, South-east Asia and the Caribbean. This was also the time of Sir Joseph Banks's botanical collections during Captain James Cook's circumnavigations of the planet and his <b>explorations</b> <b>of</b> Oceania, which formed the last phase of plant introduction on a grand scale.|$|E
5|$|American Beauty is a 1999 American drama film {{directed}} by Sam Mendes and written by Alan Ball. Kevin Spacey stars as Lester Burnham, a 42-year-old advertising executive {{who has a}} midlife crisis when he becomes infatuated with his teenage daughter's best friend, Angela (Mena Suvari). Annette Bening co-stars as Lester's materialistic wife, Carolyn, and Thora Birch plays their insecure daughter, Jane. Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, and Allison Janney also feature. The film is described by academics as a satire of American middle-class notions of beauty and personal satisfaction; analysis {{has focused on the}} film's <b>explorations</b> <b>of</b> romantic, and paternal love, sexuality, beauty, materialism, self-liberation, and redemption.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{details the}} {{experience}} of two Irish academics as they engaged in Arts-Based Education Research (ABER).

5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} {{selectively}} bred for head weight and morphological characteristics, frost hardiness, fast growth and storage ability. The {{appearance of the}} cabbage head has been given importance in selective breeding, with varieties being chosen for shape, color, firmness and other physical characteristics. Breeding objectives are now focused on increasing resistance to various insects and diseases and improving the nutritional content of cabbage. Scientific research into the genetic modification of B.oleracea crops, including cabbage, has included European Union and United States <b>explorations</b> <b>of</b> greater insect and herbicide resistance. Genetically modified B.oleracea crops are not currently used in commercial agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Lyrical themes {{found in}} Nine Inch Nails songs are largely {{concerned}} with dark <b>explorations</b> <b>of</b> the self ranging from religion, greed, fame, lust, addiction, self-deception, aging, regret, nihilism, and occasionally politics, {{with the latter}} topic often being scrutinized in Year Zero. Three of Nine Inch Nails' recordings are concept albums: The Downward Spiral, follow-up The Fragile, and the aforementioned Year Zero. With Teeth (under the working title Bleedthrough) {{was to be a}} concept album about an endless dream occurring in reality, but Reznor eventually took this idea out of the record.|$|E
5|$|Middlesex {{has several}} allusions to Greek {{classical}} myths; for example, the protagonist {{is named after}} Calliope, the muse of heroic poetry. Eugenides was partly inspired by the <b>explorations</b> <b>of</b> hermaphrodism in Greek myths to write the novel about an intersex man. In Middlesex, Cal acts out the story of Hermaphroditus, the Greek deity of bisexuality and effeminacy, while eking out a living in San Francisco. While narrating, Cal enters his ancestors' thoughts and empathizes with them, an ability possessed by Hermaphroditus. The protagonist compared himself to another mythical figureTiresias, the blind prophet of Thebes; the omniscient seer lived sevenyears as a woman because of a curse.|$|E

5|$|More goods became {{available}} in St. Louis during the economic recovery, {{largely as a}} result of the new steamboat power. Wholesalers, new banks, and other retail stores opened starting in the late 1820s and early 1830s. The fur trade continued as a major industry into the 1830s. In 1822, Jedediah Smith joined William H. Ashley's St. Louis fur trading company. Smith would later be known for his <b>explorations</b> <b>of</b> the West and for being the first American to travel overland to California. New fur trade companies such as the Rocky Mountain Fur Company pioneered trails west. Although beaver fur lost its popularity in the 1840s, St. Louis continued as a hub of buffalo hide and other furs.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{of mammals}} in Canada hearken {{back to the}} 1795 {{northern}} <b>explorations</b> <b>of</b> Samuel Hearne, whose account is considered surprisingly accurate. The first seminal work on Canadian mammals, however, was John Richardson's 1829 Fauna Boreali-Americana. Joseph Burr Tyrrell {{was the first to}} attempt to produce, in 1888, a comprehensive list of Canadian mammalian species. Ernest Thompson Seton and Charles-Eusèbe Dionne's work were also important. Modern Canadian publications with interest in mammalogy include The Canadian Field Naturalist, the Canadian Journal of Zoology and the French-language Le Naturaliste Canadien.|$|E

5|$|Willy Vandersteen used a wild {{variety of}} themes and {{influences}} {{in his work}} from early on.

While some series like De Familie Snoek and Bessy stuck very close to their origin (an everyday Flemish contemporary family for the former, and a pioneer family in the American Old West in the latter), others were more loose. De Rode Ridder, {{the story of a}} medieval knight, wandered from Arthurian tales over the crusades until the <b>explorations</b> <b>of</b> the fifteenth and sixteenth century, thereby spanning some ten centuries, and later (when Vandersteen was less involved in the series) brought in many elements of sword and sorcery and fantasy.|$|E
5|$|After {{more than}} 210years of {{relations}} with the Spanish, both indigenous societies lost cohesiveness. Official records indicate that survivors of war and disease were transported to Havana in the late 18th century. Isolated groups may have been assimilated into the Seminole nation, which formed in northern Florida when a band of Creeks consolidated surviving members of pre-Columbian societies in Florida into their own to become a distinct tribe. Seminoles were forced into the Everglades by the U.S. military during the Seminole Wars from 1835 to 1842. The U.S. military pursued the Seminoles into the region, which resulted {{in some of the}} first recorded <b>explorations</b> <b>of</b> much of the area.
