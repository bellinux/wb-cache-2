40|$|This paper explores orbits in {{extended}} mass distributions {{and develops}} an analytic approximation {{scheme based on}} <b>epicycloids</b> (spirograph patterns). We focus on the Hernquist potential 1 /(1 þ), which provides a good model for many astrophysical systems, including elliptical galaxies (with an R 1 / 4 law), dark matter halos (where N-body simulations indicate a nearly universal density profile), and young embedded star clusters (with gas density For a given potential, one can readily calculate orbital solutions {{as a function of}} energy and angular momentum using numerical methods. In contrast, this paper presents a number of analytic results for the Hernquist potential and proves a series of general constraints showing that orbits have similar properties for any extended mass distribution (including, e. g., the NFW profile). We discuss circular orbits, radial orbits, zero-energy orbits, different definitions of eccentricity, analogs of Kepler’s law, the definition of orbital elements, and the relation of these orbits to spirograph patterns (<b>epicycloids).</b> Over a large portion of parameter space, the orbits can be adequately described (with accuracy better than 10 %) using the parametric equations of <b>epicycloids,</b> thereby providing an analytic description of the orbits. As an application of this formal development, we find a solution for the orbit of the Large Magellanic Cloud in the potential of our Galaxy...|$|R

40|$|Given a normed plane P, we call P-cycloids the planar curves {{which are}} {{homothetic}} to their double P-evolutes.

We can also find an orthonormal basis of C^ 0 (S^ 1) with a natural decomposition into symmetric and anti-symmetric functions, which are support functions of symmetric and constant width curves, respectively. As applications, we prove that the iterations of involutes of a closed curve converge to a constant and a generalization of the Sturm-Hurwitz Theorem.

40|$|Cycloids, hipocycloids and <b>epicycloids</b> have {{an often}} {{forgotten}} common property: they are homothetic to their evolutes. But what if use convex symmetric polygons as unit balls, can we define evolutes and cycloids which are genuinely discrete? Indeed, we can! We define discrete cycloids as eigenvectors of a discrete double evolute transform {{which can be}} seen as a linear operator on a vector space we call curvature radius space. We are also able to classify such cycloids according to the eigenvalues of that transform, and show that the number of cusps of each cycloid is well determined by the ordering of those eigenvalues. As an elegant application, we easily establish a version of the four-vertex theorem for closed convex polygons. The whole theory is developed using only linear algebra, and concrete examples are given. Comment: 23 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

Evaluation of the first stress invariant along the rim the hole allows the definition of the caustics and its initial curves formed around the hole which define the state of stress at its neighborhood. The characteristic properties of the caustics were studied which were three-lobe <b>epicycloids</b> and the relationships of their dimensions with the surrounding elastic stress field. The domain of influence of these perforations was defined which allowed their use as stress rosettes for evaluating the stress field at different points of the beam without any mutual influence and with the longitudinal boundaries of the beam.

We primarily show that the decay rates and mass shifts of vertex operators (n,m;λ_n,λ̅_m) and their "duals" (n,m;λ_n,λ̅_m^*) are equal to leading order in the string coupling, implying for instance that decay rates of <b>epicycloids</b> equal those of hypocycloids. We then compute the power and decay rates associated to massless IR radiation for the trajectory (1, 1;λ_ 1,λ̅_ 1), and find that it is precisely reproduced by the low energy effective theory of Dabholkar and Harvey. Guided by this correspondence, we conjecture the result for arbitrary trajectories (n,m;λ_n,λ̅_m) and discover a curious relation between gravitational and axion plus dilaton radiation. It is now possible to start exploring string evolution in regimes where a low energy effective description is less useful, such as in the vicinity of cusps. Comment: 5 page...|$|R
