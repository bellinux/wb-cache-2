He continued his endeavors when the series' concept began to materialize, as he received a copy of Richard Yates' novel Revolutionary Road (1962) from the executives of AMC. Weiner discussed the look of Mad Men with production designer Bob Shaw and cinematographer Phil Abraham, whom Weiner had previously collaborated with in The Sopranos. Abraham wanted to establish a more genuine approach to portraying society in the 1960s, rather than [...] "simply referencing the period as seen in movies of that time. We wanted to be more genuine than that. Movies were an influence." [...] In evoking historical accuracy of elements such as architecture and graphic design, Abraham sought inspiration from the buildings designed by the architecture firm Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. [...] He said, [...] "We noticed that in all the Skidmore, Owings & Merrill designs of contemporary buildings, the ceiling—the overhead grid of lights—was a strong <b>graphic</b> <b>element</b> in all the office spaces. In one design we loved, the whole ceiling was like a lightbox. It {{was a time of}} high modernism, and we embraced the notion of presenting the world in that way. These were new work spaces—sleek, not stuffy." ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{various aspects}} of Super Mario RPG have {{received}} mixed reviews, the game garnered praise {{for the quality of}} the graphics and for the humor in particular. Nintendo Powers review commented that the [...] "excellent" [...] 3D graphics helped the game appeal to a much wider audience than most traditional RPGs. In March 1997, Nintendo Power nominated the game for several awards, including [...] "Best Graphics", in a player's choice contest, though Super Mario 64 won [...] "Best Graphics". Electronic Gaming Monthly praised the graphics, stating that they are [...] "the best seen on the Super NES". Scary Larry of GamePro gave the game a perfect 5/5 in all four categories (graphics, sound, control, and FunFactor), and highly praised the rendered enemies, cinematics, and spell animations. 1UP.com stated that the <b>graphic</b> <b>element</b> is [...] "strong enough to resemble a Mario title but still retains the role-playing theme at the same time", and Electronic Gaming Monthly commented that the graphics are [...] "typical of Nintendo, using clean and colorful graphics along with nice animation". RPGamer editor Derek Cavin called the backgrounds [...] "beautiful" [...] and stated that they [...] "perfectly bring the Mushroom Kingdom and surrounding areas into 3D". Skyler Miller from Allgame stated that the graphics are [...] "absolutely outstanding, with colorful, 3D rendered visuals that once seemed impossible on the Super NES. This is definitely the high watermark for 3D graphics on any 16-bit system". The editor also called the music [...] "quite extraordinary" [...] and that the songs [...] "match the mood of the surrounding environment". In the Virtual Console re-release, IGN's Lucas Thomas's review of Super Mario RPG stated that the game's experience [...] "completes itself with a compelling story, a humorous attitude and a variety of interspersed mini-games that break up the adventuring action". The publication also stated that the soundtrack is [...] "spectacular and a joy to listen to" [...] and the graphics [...] "took full advantage of the system's 16-bit technology and looks great".|$|E
2500|$|Some of the {{radicals}} used in Chinese dictionaries, {{even in the}} era of Kangxi, were not genuinely distinctive graphic elements. [...] They served only to index certain unique characters that do not have more obvious possible radicals. [...] The radical 鬯 (chàng [...] "sacrificial wine") is used to index only one character: 鬱 (yù, [...] "luxuriant", [...] "dense", or [...] "moody"). Modern dictionaries tend to eliminate these kinds of radicals when it is possible to find some more widely used alternative <b>graphic</b> <b>element</b> under which a character can be categorized. In addition, in some modern dictionaries, characters may even be indexed under more than one radical {{in order to make it}} easier to find them.|$|E

2500|$|The {{title of}} the work draws a basic {{distinction}} between two types of characters, wén 文 and zì 字, the former being those composed of a single <b>graphic</b> <b>element</b> (such as shān 山 [...] "mountain"), and the latter being those containing more than one such element (such as hǎo 好 [...] "good" [...] with 女 [...] "woman" [...] and 子 [...] "child") which can be deconstructed into and analyzed {{in terms of their}} component elements. Note that the character 文 itself exemplifies the category wén 文, while 字 (which is composed of 宀 and 子) exemplifies zì 字. Thus, Shuōwén Jiězì means [...] "commenting on" [...] (shuō [...] "speak; talk; comment; explain") the wén, which cannot be deconstructed, and [...] "analyzing" [...] (jiě [...] "untie; separate; divide; analyze; explain; deconstruct") the zì.|$|E
