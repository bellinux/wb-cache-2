BBC Books took back the rights to publish original fiction in 1997 and published two series, the Eighth Doctor Adventures and the Past Doctor Adventures {{as well as some}} anthologies of short stories, until 2005. Big Finish Productions adapted several NAs, minus the Doctor, into audio plays; on the back of these, they won a license from the BBC to produce original audio plays featuring the Doctors and their companions, and eventually also produced plays featuring other characters and monsters from the TV series and spin-offs; Big Finish has also published short story anthologies. Big Finish attracted a number of writers from the books series as well as new writers, including Rob Shearman; it also gave future Doctor David Tennant his first acting role <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Doctor</b> Who story.|$|E

William Thomas and Sharon Morgan were cast as Gwen's parents Geraint and Mary Cooper.

Thomas had previously appeared as two different characters in the 1988 Doctor Who serial Remembrance of the Daleks and the 2005 Doctor Who episode [...] "Boom Town". Upon appearing in [...] "Something Borrowed" [...] he became the first actor to have appeared in all three of the classic series, new series and Torchwood. Nerys Hughes played Rhys' mother Brenda Williams, in addition to a duplicate form of the alien Nostrovite. Like Thomas she had previously appeared <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Doctor</b> Who serial (the 1982 story Kinda). Hughes enjoyed getting to play a [...] "monster" [...] {{for the first time in}} her career which involved having [...] "fangs and claws and red eyes" [...] and being wired up so [...] "all this black blood can ooze out when I get shot". Despite the funny aspect of the script Hughes took the role seriously stating that [...] "everyone plays it for real" [...] and that [...] "you can't camp it up". She believed that as an actor [...] "you've got to believe what you're doing".|$|E

He was also voted Best Actor by readers of SFX magazine. Eccleston was named Best Actor with 59.42% {{of the vote}} in BBC.co.uk's online [...] "Best of Drama" [...] poll in 2005. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>Doctor</b> Who Magazine poll in 2006 Eccleston was voted the third {{greatest}} Doctor behind those portrayed by Tom Baker and David Tennant. In April 2011 IGN also listed Eccleston's Doctor as the third best Doctor, opining that he [...] "gave us a tough-as-nails Doctor damaged by war and guilt, but still possessing the same spark of fun and adventure as his previous selves." [...] The entertainment website stated that in introducing a new generation to the show he [...] "became an icon for a new millennium." [...] Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph named him the ninth best Doctor, noting that Eccleston was [...] "a serious actor" [...] and [...] "his attempts at a lighter style could seem a tad forced", though this was [...] "offset by his showdowns against the Daleks". Fuller also was disappointed that his [...] "time was over all too swiftly". A 2012 poll conducted by the United States media news magazine Entertainment Weekly resulted in Eccleston being voted the fourth most popular Doctor, behind David Tennant, Matt Smith (the Eleventh Doctor) and Tom Baker.|$|E
500|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>Doctor</b> Who Magazine interview, Barrowman {{described}} Jack's {{love for}} Ianto as [...] "lustful", and explained [...] "I don't think he'd settle down with Ianto. He might do, but he'd let Ianto {{know that he}} [...] has to play around on the side". The Torchwood Series Two premiere sees Jack ask Ianto out on a date, after finding out Gwen is engaged. John Barrowman and Gareth David-Lloyd opined {{in an interview at}} Comic-Con to fan questions that Jack's relationship with Ianto has however brought out Jack's empathy, and helped to ground him. John Barrowman {{said in an interview that}} Ianto [...] "brings out the [...] "human" [...] in [...] " [...] and [...] "brings out more ... empathy because he’s actually fallen for someone and he really cares about somebody ... makes him warm to other people ... makes him more approachable." [...] In the same interview, Gareth David-Lloyd said of the relationship and his character that [...] "I think Ianto’s always made him care and that is really the heart of the show." [...] However, Stephen James Walker feels that Jack's relationship with Ianto is one-sided; Ianto seems to feel the relationship is [...] "serious and committed", but while dancing with Gwen in [...] "Something Borrowed", Walker believes that Jack appears to equate his relationship with Ianto to nothing more than a [...] "recreational activity", and considers it [...] "obvious Jack only has eyes and thoughts for Gwen". The novel The House that Jack Built includes a scene where Ianto confides in Gwen that he knows that to Jack he is [...] "just a shag", though discloses that the relationship means more to him. In the same novel, however, he also refers to himself in front of Jack as his [...] "boyfriend". When Ianto expounds these same insecurities to Jack in the radio play [...] "The Dead Line" [...] (just prior to Children of Earth), however, Jack insists [...] "You will never be just a blip in time, Ianto Jones. Not to me." ...|$|E

Percy Hoskins, writing in 1984, was of the opposite opinion, adamant that Adams was not guilty but merely [...] "naive" [...] and [...] "avaricious". In 1985 Sir Patrick Devlin, the judge, stated that Adams {{may have been a}} [...] "mercenary mercy killer" [...] but, though compassionate, he was at the same time greedy and [...] "prepared to sell death": 'He did not think of himself as a murderer but a dispenser of death [...] According to his lights, he had done nothing wrong. There was nothing wrong <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> getting a legacy, nor in his bestowing in return [...] a death as happy as heroin could make it.' He also [...] "could be convinced that Dr Adams had helped to end Mrs Hullett's life". In 2000, Surtees, a former colleague of Adams, wrote a more sympathetic account of him as being the victim of a police vendetta.|$|E

If you believe <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor,</b> you ought to make him believe in you. And if you are in bed, he will believe in you, and if you are out of it, he is apt not to.
