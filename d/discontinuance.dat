The US Congress approved amendments permitting greater collaboration in late June. Following Soviet assent on 30 August 1958 to the one-year moratorium, the three countries conducted a series of tests in September and October. At least 54 tests were conducted by the US and 14 by the Soviet Union in this period. On 31 October 1958 the three countries initiated test-ban negotiations (the Conference on the <b>Discontinuance</b> of Nuclear Tests) and agreed to a temporary moratorium (the Soviet Union joined the moratorium shortly after this date).

5|$|The <b>discontinuance</b> of the Atlantic City Express in 1995, and {{the arrival}} of the California Cars in 1996 and the Surfliner railcars in 2000–2002, lessened the need for the Metroliner-based cab cars. However, the Vermonter {{corridor}} service began using them when a reverse move was added between Springfield, Massachusetts and Palmer, Massachusetts in 1995. The later cab cars, and some of the earlier conversions, were retired in the 1990s and early 2000s. In 2007, six of the 9600-series cab cars were brought out of retirement to support additional frequencies on the newly re-electrified Keystone Service. After the Vermonters backup move was eliminated in 2014, the ex-Metroliner cab cars have been used primarily on the Keystone Service and New Haven–Springfield Shuttle.|$|E

5|$|The {{immediate}} {{impetus for}} the Pennsylvanian was the <b>discontinuance</b> of the National Limited, a New YorkKansas City train which had provided service over the corridor. The Pennsylvanian began on April 27, 1980, as a state-supported daylight train between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, with connecting service to New York via the Philadelphian (a Clocker) westbound and the Montrealer eastbound. At the time the Pennsylvanian was inaugurated, the Broadway Limited was departing Pittsburgh at an inconvenient early morning hour. The new train ran with Amfleet equipment, including a cafe car. Pennsylvania agreed to pay 20% of the train's costs for the first year, or $580,000, with the state and Amtrak eventually splitting the costs 50/50 by the third year.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{number of}} studies have {{demonstrated}} a reduction in neural activity for oblique gratings as compared to horizontal or vertical gratings. This has been associated with the psychophysical oblique effect. Using event-related potentials, we now assessed the neural activity associated with the processing of higher-order stimuli of different orientations. We applied a novel stimulus paradigm that is particularly suited to investigate mid- and high-level vision by obviating low-level responses. It consisted of a line grid that emerged perspicuously from a continuous movement of stimulus elements without any temporal <b>discontinuances</b> in stimulus presentation. This Gestalt could be oriented along the cardinal axes or rotated by 45 °. We obtained distinct event-related potentials with a moderate task-dependence. They showed a correlate of Gestalt processing that did not depend on the orientation, followed by a P 300 -like component that was 50 % larger for the 45 ° Gestalt. Surprisingly, this oblique effect is opposite to previous studies using gratings. We propose that it originated from a bias in neural processing, induced by the long-term environmental experience of the subjects...|$|R

The alternative approach to the description of the processes of physical wear and creep of pavement consisting in comparison of asphalt concrete creep curve and the curve of the mathematical model of cusp catastrophe, is received.

40|$|Dynamic {{behaviors}} of Zr 51 Ti 5 Ni 10 Cu 25 Al 9 bulk metallic glass were investigated using electric gun and magnetically driven isentropic compression device which provide shock and ramp wave loading respectively. Double-wave structure was observed under shock compression while three-wave structure was observed under ramp compression in 0 ∼ 18 GPa. The HEL of Zr 51 Ti 5 Ni 10 Cu 25 Al 9 is 8. 97 ± 0. 61 GPa and IEL is 8. 8 ± 0. 3 GPa, respectively. Strength of Zr 51 Ti 5 Ni 10 Cu 25 Al 9 estimated from HEL is 5. 0 ± 0. 3 GPa while the strength estimated from IEL is 3. 6 ± 0. 1 GPa. Shock wave velocity versus particle velocity curve of Zr 51 Ti 5 Ni 10 Cu 25 Al 9 under shock compression {{appears to be}} bilinear and a kink appears at about 18 GPa.

In late 1944, the USCG determined that this complement was sufficient for its needs and discontinued the program. However, to replace the officers who had gone overseas, and those separated from the SPARS, the officer candidate school was later reopened for one last class. The candidates were all former enlisted personnel, who received their indoctrination at the USCG training station, Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, New York.

40|$|The project REsearch on a CRuiser Enabled Air Transport Environment (RECREATE) {{is about}} the {{introduction}} and airworthiness of cruiser-feeder operations for civil aircraft. Cruiser-feeder operations are investigated as a promising pioneering idea for the air transport of the future. The top level objective of the project is to demonstrate on a preliminary design level that cruiser-feeder operations (as a concept to reduce fuel burn and CO 2 emission levels) can be shown {{to comply with the}} airworthiness requirements for civil aircraft. (The 42 -month RECREATE project research receives funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP 7 / 2007 - 2013) under grant agreement n° 284741. This publication reflects only the authors' views. The European Union is not liable for any use that may be made of the information contained therein.) Air-to-air refuelling operations are an example of this concept. Currently Air-to-air refuelling operations are primary used to extend range of aircrafts in military operation. However some research has been done in the past to estimate fuel saving capabilities of air-to-air refuelling in both military and civil operations. Most of these estimations give highly positive results on the fuel saving capabilities. Nevertheless these results mainly based on a small number of optimised cases. As part of the primary design in the RECREATE project this paper will discuss air-to-air refuelling operations in a traffic scenario based on Eurocontrol-Data containing one day of traffic over Europe. With this traffic two main scenarios have been created. The first contains traffic between Europe and America while the other one contains traffic between Europe and Asia. The traffic scenarios used in the paper will exchange current flights due flight with air to air refuelling somewhere on the route. The aircrafts used on these routes will be exchanged to RECREATE specific aircrafts as aircrafts who use air to air refuelling have a much lower design range than the aircrafts they replace. As reference the same routes will be flown by aircrafts without air to air refuelling and a higher design range. These aircrafts have the same efficiency as the RECREATE Aircraft. Also the reference aircrafts will use direct routes while the aircrafts with air to air refuelling will use fuel optimized routes with one or more refuelling operations. The third aircraft type used in the traffic simulation is the Feeder aircraft. The Feeder aircraft will take off from a specific Feeder base and refuel a number of cruiser aircrafts {{depending on the size of}} the feeder. The Feeder will then land on the same Feeder base. The main parameters for the Feeder are the Feeder size, the Feeder range and the Feeder efficiency. The Scenario includes 2776 connections between Europe and North-America. In this Transatlantic Scenario 8 Feeder bases have been chosen to serve as take-off and landing airport for the feeder aircrafts. The location of these feeder bases orientates at the optimal refuelling position for these connections. In the simulation the cruiser aircrafts will fly routes where the fuel spend by the cruiser and the fuel spend by the feeder spent on refuelling this cruiser aircraft is minimal. Furthermore the Cruiser will use the same take-off time as the original aircraft in the Eurocontrol data. The Feeder aircrafts then will be scheduled according to the cruisers flight plan. With these fuel optimized routes the traffic is more centred towards the feeder bases. The whole system depends strongly on reliable services at the feeder bases. This paper will discuss the effect of <b>discontinuances</b> at the feeder bases...|$|R
