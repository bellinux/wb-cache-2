5|$|The Poitevin, {{also called}} Mulassier ("mule-breeder"), Poitevin Mulassier or Trait Mulassier is a <b>draft</b> <b>horse</b> from the Poitou area of France. It is a late-maturing breed with strong bones, {{known for its}} calm nature. It is found in many solid coat colors, the result of {{crossbreeding}} with several other European draft breeds throughout its history, {{and is the only}} French <b>draft</b> <b>horse</b> to be found in bay dun. Today, Poitevins are used mainly for driving, although some are used for riding and equine therapy.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} of Auxois is very low, {{and it is}} one of the rarest of the nine French <b>draft</b> <b>horse</b> breeds. In 2001, it had the eighth-smallest {{population of}} the nine breeds, making the threats of inbreeding and extinction very real. In 2006, 250 active breeding mares and 32 stallions were reported, with 125 breeders (the term breeder applying to any person owning at least one active breeding mare). The Auxois represented 1 percent of total French <b>draft</b> <b>horse</b> registrations in 2007. Burgundy is by far the main breeding area, with a few horses in the Rhône-Alpes and Auvergne regions. There are no known registered Auxois living outside France and it is almost unknown outside of its home region, even within the rest of France. Of the nine French <b>draft</b> <b>horse</b> breeds, the Auxois is the only one that is not exported. Between 1992 and 2011, between 80 and 146 foals were born each year, with numbers ranging from 105 to 128 between 2007 and 2011.|$|E

5|$|The Poitevin breed {{was created}} in the marshes of the Poitou region, {{especially}} around Luçon, La Rochelle, Melle and Niort.

5|$|Because of {{the genetic}} {{strength}} of the desert-bred Arabian horse, Arabian bloodlines have {{played a part in}} the development of nearly every modern light horse breed, including the Thoroughbred, Orlov Trotter, Morgan, American Saddlebred, American Quarter Horse, and Warmblood breeds such as the Trakehner. Arabian bloodlines have also influenced the development of the Welsh Pony, the Australian Stock Horse, Percheron <b>draft</b> <b>horse,</b> Appaloosa, and the Colorado Ranger Horse.|$|E
5|$|In {{the regions}} of Saint-Lo and Cotentin, the Norman Cob was {{widespread}} in agricultural uses until 1950, and the population continued to increase {{in the first half}} of the 20th century, even through the occupation during World War II. Even the Percheron, which was internationally recognized as the Norman <b>draft</b> <b>horse,</b> was not as popular in the homeland of the Norman Cob breed. In 1945, Norman Cob stallions accounted for 40% of the conscripted horses, and in 1950 a studbook was created for the breed.|$|E
50|$|Short, upright pasterns {{are often}} seen in <b>draft</b> <b>horses.</b> This is because <b>draft</b> <b>horses</b> bred for pulling rather than riding (and so they were not {{selected}} for smooth gaits of a saddle horse), and because upright pasterns give more leverage to dig into the ground as the horse pulls a heavy load. Short, upright pasterns are also commonly seen in Quarter Horses, Warmbloods, and Paint Horses. However, riding horses {{are more likely to}} have problems with upright pasterns than <b>draft</b> <b>horses</b> because they tend to work at faster speeds. Due to the lack of shock absorption, horses that have upright pasterns should be kept off hard surfaces whenever possible.|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} a growing {{interest}} in using <b>draft</b> <b>horses</b> for farm work in Germany and Europe can be observed. However, precise data concerning the performance of modern horse-drawn technology are currently rarely available. In a field study labor time requirements were measured on four farms and one market garden with regular use of <b>draft</b> <b>horses.</b> In addition, farm managers were interviewed {{in order to learn}} about their intentions to use <b>draft</b> <b>horses</b> nowadays. On the basis of the gathered data, area performance (ha/h) and total labor time requirements (AKh/ha) of several field procedures were processed. A comparison with current tractor data shows that although the tractor performs better in all field procedures, there are merely little differences in crop cultivation such as pasture or weed harrowing. Considering all arising costs the use of <b>draft</b> <b>horses</b> can, under certain conditions, even achieve a better profitability than the use of a comparable tractor...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of the canine cranial cruciate ligament repair system on laryngeal hemiplegia in heavy <b>draft</b> <b>horses.</b> Twenty-four heavy <b>draft</b> <b>horses</b> diagnosed with grade 4 laryngeal hemiplegia were allocated to either the prosthetic laryngoplasty (PL) group (n= 14) or a canine cranial cruciate ligament repair system (CCCLRS) group (n= 10). Right to left angle quotients (RLQs) of abductions of the arytenoid cartilages were endoscopically evaluated before and after surgery. Post-operative RLQs in the CCCLRS group were significantly lower than those of the PL group (P< 0. 01).

5|$|All {{registered}} Colorado Ranger Horses trace {{directly to}} one of two foundation sires in their pedigree. The first is Patches #1 and the second is Max #2, a son of another horse named Max born in 1918. Registered Colorado Rangerbreds may be bred to registered Thoroughbreds, American Quarter Horses, Appaloosas, Arabians and AraAppaloosas, and the resulting progeny registered as purebred Colorado Rangerbreds. Horses with <b>draft</b> <b>horse</b> or pony blood may not be registered. Colorado Ranger Horses may be double-registered with the Appaloosa Horse Club, but Appaloosas may not be registered with the CRHA unless they have the proper bloodlines. Approximately 90 percent of Colorado Ranger horses are dual-registered.|$|E
5|$|As it {{has been}} since the {{creation}} of the Auxois stud book, only purebred horses and Ardennes and Trait du Nord crosses are allowed to be registered. This is to ensure selection for the desired breed characteristics, which are now a lighter and more active horse than was seen during the time of breeding for horse meat. Horses bred through artificial insemination and embryo transfer are allowed to be registered; those potentially bred through cloning are not. The Syndicat du Cheval de Trait Auxois (Auxois <b>Draft</b> <b>Horse</b> Association) is the national registry, managing the stud book, breed standard and promotion of the breed. An annual breed competition is held in September in Semur-en-Auxois.|$|E
5|$|By the 1970s, the Auxois {{had almost}} become extinct, and the French {{government}} began pushing the breeding of all native draft horses for meat production, {{as opposed to}} agricultural usage. However, the meat of the Auxois was not considered high quality, and this, combined with a lower-than-expected market for meat, led to a continued decline in French <b>draft</b> <b>horse</b> populations. In the 1990s, the French government reversed its position on breeding for meat, and began promoting draft breeds for leisure pursuits. The Auxois continues to be rare, having the eighth-smallest population numbers of the nine native French draft breeds. An annual breed show is held in Semur-en-Auxois, and the Auxois is frequently seen at the Paris International Agricultural Show.|$|E

5|$|During World War I, Trait du Nord {{horses were}} among those confiscated by Germans from Belgium and France {{for use in the}} war. In 1919, these horses were {{returned}} to their homeland, allowing the reconstruction of the breed. During World War II, the armed forces used all stocks of fuel, and the <b>draft</b> <b>horse</b> was used to continue agricultural production in France. After the war, farmers quickly equipped themselves with mechanized equipment. The decline in the breeding of the Trait du Nord became noticeable in the early 1950s, and by 1960 breed numbers had collapsed completely. By the early 1970s, breeding had slowed so much that the Trait du Nord, along with other French draft breeds, was in danger of extinction.|$|E
5|$|French {{breeding}} of the Mérens is divided between two schools of thought. The first is traditional breeders seeking {{to preserve the}} original type, that of a light <b>draft</b> <b>horse</b> living high in the mountains year-round and retaining the hardiness for which the breed is known. The second comes from {{the conversion of the}} Mérens to a leisure horse in the 1980s, and aims to transform the physical type of the breed into a more sports-oriented horse to ensure the survival of the breed. This dichotomy has become a source of tension between farmers and users of the breed.|$|E
5|$|The Trait du Nord, {{previously}} {{also known}} as Ardennais du Nord or Ardennais de type Nord, is a breed of heavy <b>draft</b> <b>horse</b> developed and bred {{in the area of}} Hainaut in western Belgium and in northeastern France. Originally considered a subtype of the Ardennes, it was recognized as an individual breed with the opening of a studbook in 1903. Developed in the fertile Flemish grasslands, it was bred for size and pulling power for agricultural work. By 1855, the horses bred near Hainaut were considered by some veterinarians to be superior to other Flemish draft breeds. The Trait du Nord was used extensively in mining from the late 19th century through 1920, with lesser use continuing through the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|Enthusiasts claim {{descent from}} the horses {{painted on the}} cave walls of Lascaux, though {{this has not been}} {{verified}} by scientific studies. Horses have been recorded in the area since at least the 10th century, and the regional type was preferred by magistrates and clergy in medieval times. The Poitevin breed as it is known today began to take shape in the early 17th century, as engineers began draining the French marshes and brought with them their draft horses, which were crossed with native horses. Since early in its history, the Poitevin has been used extensively for the breeding of mules, and although commonly called a <b>draft</b> <b>horse,</b> was not favored for agricultural purposes. During the 19th century, the population of the Poitevin increased, reaching 50,000 pure and crossbred mares by 1867. Crossbreeding with other draft breeds led to concerns about the purity of the Poitevin population, but a small group of breeders worked to preserve the remaining purebred population.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study of}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA published in 2012, the Canadian horse and the Newfoundland pony {{were found to be}} the most genetically diverse of the Canadian breeds studied, which also included the Sable Island horse and the Lac La Croix pony. The Canadian horse showed high haplotype diversity, sharing haplotypes with all Canadian populations, as well as draft breeds, Nordic pony breeds and British mountain and moorland pony breeds also tested in the study. The Canadian horse had been shown to be related to <b>draft</b> <b>horse</b> breeds, including the Percheron, Belgian and Clydesdale, in previous microsatellite loci studies. This relationship was supported by findings in the 2012 study. The high levels of diversity in the Canadian horse supported the conclusions of a 1998 study, which determined that the small population size and historical genetic bottlenecks had not resulted in a significant loss of genetic variation. The 1998 paper also stated that the Canadian horse did not show inbreeding any more significant than other, more popular, breeds.|$|E
5|$|Multi-purpose types {{like the}} Charolais and the Morvan were slowly supplanted in farmers' favor by draft horses. The Nivernais breed, in particular, was {{preferred}} by farmers and threatened {{the existence of}} the Charolais. Thus, the original small multi-purpose strain of Charolais gave way to a type of small <b>draft</b> <b>horse</b> that was next crossed with purebred and crossbred Thoroughbreds until, by 1850, it had become a horse for cavalry purposes. It was thought by some enthusiasts, however, that this outcrossing reduced the quality of the breed, and many missed the old-style Charolais, which had disappeared {{due to a lack of}} demand and use. However, others thought that the outcrossings had benefited the Charolais breed: in 1919, one author stated that the breeding of the Charolais type was in excellent condition, and a report from the time stated that the favorite horse of King Albert I of Belgium was a Charolais named Titanic.|$|E
