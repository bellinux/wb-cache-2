5|$|Coffin {{continued}} to farm {{after moving to}} Indiana and {{within a year of}} his arrival he opened the first dry-goods store in Newport. In later years Coffin credited the success of his business, which he expanded in the 1830s, with providing him the ability to become heavily involved in the costly enterprise of the Underground Railroad, a costly and risky <b>enterprise</b> <b>that</b> provided a network of stopover sites for fugitive slaves as they traveled north into Canada.|$|E
5|$|Data {{determines that}} the only way to restore the realities is to send Worf via shuttlecraft to the Enterprise of his universe, passing through the fissure and using the shuttlecraft's engines to reseal it. After {{locating}} the correct ship, Worf begins to travel back but is attacked by another <b>Enterprise</b> <b>that</b> has come from a Borg-overrun universe, its crew refusing to return. The <b>Enterprise</b> <b>that</b> he left fires upon the hostile ship and destroys it. Worf safely passes through the fissure, finding himself back in normality with a single Enterprise in front of him. After boarding, Worf finds that no time has passed since he initially entered the fissure. When he returns to his room expecting a surprise party, he finds only Troi waiting to give him a single present and, knowing that the two are married in many alternate universes, he invites her to share dinner with him.|$|E

50|$|Since 1983 {{the return}} of foreign {{investment}} has been slow {{because of the high}} costs of rebuilding and a continuing perception of political uncertainty. Of the approximately twenty <b>enterprises</b> <b>that</b> had reopened by the late 1980s, most were import-export <b>enterprises</b> <b>that</b> lacked a formal relationship with the banking sector. Most Chadian-owned enterprises had managed to re-establish themselves. Yet by 1986, small <b>enterprises</b> <b>that</b> had assembled bicycles, motorcycles, and radios remained closed.|$|R
40|$|The study {{starts with}} a {{classification}} of the enterprises depending on their participation to the Vietnam social security. Among the <b>enterprises</b> <b>that</b> contribute, one striking feature is that on average the share in the wage bill of the contributions paid to the Vietnam social security is {{much lower than the}} contribution rate established in the law. Even if the <b>enterprises</b> <b>that</b> do not register their employees are excluded from the calculation, the average ratio is of 7. 6 percent while the legal rate was in 2006 equal to 23 percent. The study, consequently, examine this issue before investigating the characteristics of the <b>enterprises</b> <b>that</b> do not register their employees. The paper shows that this low ratio is due to a wide practice by enterprises of paying contributions on lower wages than current wages. The paper investigates, furthermore, who benefit from the practice of avoiding registration and from the practice of under-reporting wages to social security. The results indicate strong evidence <b>that</b> employees in <b>enterprises</b> <b>that</b> are not registered to social security and in <b>enterprises</b> <b>that</b> under report wage receive higher net wages.

5|$|After {{an alien}} entity declaring {{itself to be}} God destroys {{spacecraft}} en route to Earth, the Enterprise is launched {{under the command of}} Admiral Kirk to engage the vessel. He re-assembles the former crew, including Spock, and sets out to intercept the alien. As they approach the entity, it transports a humanoid probe on board the <b>Enterprise</b> <b>that</b> takes a variety of forms—including that of Jesus. The crew determine that the being and its craft are from an alternate dimension and have been responsible for the creation of religion of numerous planets to teach their inhabitants its laws in a manner understandable at their points in development. The being is malfunctioning; the crew repair it and send it back to its own dimension.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{had many}} {{friends in the}} eastern aristocracy, and quickly gained a {{reputation}} among them as a frontier leader. He ran a successful horse-breeding <b>enterprise</b> <b>that</b> won him acclaim throughout the Northwest Territory. Harrison became a champion of lower land prices, a primary concern of settlers in the Territory at the time. The U.S. Congress had legislated a territorial land policy that led to high land costs, which many of the territory's residents disliked. In October 1799, after it had been determined that the Northwest Territory's population had reached a sufficient number to have a delegate in the U.S. Congress, Harrison ran for election. He campaigned to encourage further migration to the territory, which eventually led to statehood.|$|E

5|$|The Megans are {{determined}} to put humanity and the Enterprise crew on trial for what humans did to their people during the Salem witch-trials as well as Lucien for bringing them here. Kirk comes out in support of Lucien's life and says that killing him would make the Megans just like humans. Lucien's punishment is to be condemned into limbo for eternity for bringing humans into the Megans' world. While Kirk states that humanity has progressed infinitely since 1691, the Megans ignore his words. At {{the end of the}} trial, Kirk offers his life to save Lucien's and the Megans are so impressed by the captain's gesture that they spare Lucien, and tell the <b>Enterprise</b> <b>that</b> they would welcome future human visits to their planet. They also return the Enterprise to its proper universe, while Lucien is revealed to be Lucifer.|$|E
5|$|The Sunda Strait {{campaign}} of January 1794 {{was a series}} of manoeuvres and naval actions fought between warships and privateers of the French Republic and a squadron of vessels sent by the British East India Company to protect trade in the region, later augmented by Dutch warships. The campaign developed as French forces based on Île de France reacted more quickly than the British forces in the Indian Ocean to the expansion of the French Revolutionary Wars on 1 February 1793. French privateers rapidly spread along the British trade routes in the Far East, becoming concentrated around the narrow Sunda Strait between the islands of Java and Sumatra in the Dutch East Indies. These ships were soon joined by French Navy frigates and began to inflict losses on shipping in the region. The Royal Navy forces in the Indian Ocean were deployed elsewhere and so the East India Company, the private <b>enterprise</b> <b>that</b> ruled much of British India in the 1790s and maintained their own fleet and navy, raised a squadron of armed merchant ships to patrol the Strait and drive off the raiders.|$|E
