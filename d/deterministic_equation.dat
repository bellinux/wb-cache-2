50|$|Fluid {{models are}} {{continuous}} deterministic analogs of queueing networks obtained {{by taking the}} limit when the process is scaled in time and space, allowing heterogeneous objects. This scaled trajectory converges to a <b>deterministic</b> <b>equation</b> which allows {{the stability of the}} system to be proven.

50|$|The actual {{random walk}} obeys a {{stochastic}} equation of motion. Yet, the probability density function (PDF) obeys a <b>deterministic</b> <b>equation</b> of motion. Formulation of PDFs of random walks {{can be done}} in terms of the discrete (in space) master equation and the generalized master equation or the continuum (in space and time) Fokker Planck equation and its generalizations. Continuous time random walks, renewal theory, and the path representation are also useful formulations of random walks. The network of relationships between the various descriptions provides a powerful tool in the analysis of random walks. Arbitrarily heterogeneous environments make the analysis difficult, especially in high dimensions.|$|E

5000|$|All this {{familiar}} {{story is}} true, but it leaves out an irony. Bohr's version {{of quantum mechanics}} was deeply flawed, {{but not for the}} reason Einstein thought. The Copenhagen interpretation describes what happens when an observer makes a measurement, but the observer and the act of measurement are themselves treated classically. This is surely wrong: Physicists and their apparatus must be governed by the same quantum mechanical rules that govern everything else in the universe. But these rules are expressed in terms of a wave function (or, more precisely, a state vector) that evolves in a perfectly deterministic way. So where do the probabilistic rules of the Copenhagen interpretation come from?Considerable {{progress has been made in}} recent years toward the resolution of the problem, which I cannot go into here. It is enough to say that neither Bohr nor Einstein had focused on the real problem with quantum mechanics. The Copenhagen rules clearly work, so they have to be accepted. But this leaves the task of explaining them by applying the <b>deterministic</b> <b>equation</b> for the evolution of the wave function, the Schrödinger equation, to observers and their apparatus.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a model for}} projecting future hospital bed requirements, based on clinical judgment and basic probability theory. Clinical judgment is used to define various categories of care, including a category for patients who are inappropriately hospitalized, for a large teaching hospital with a heavy indigent and psychiatric workload. Survey results and discharge abstract data are then used to calculate expected discharges and patient days for each clinical category. These expected discharges and patient days are converted into estimated bed requirements using a simple <b>deterministic</b> <b>equation.</b> Results of this multistage model are compared with the results obtained from exercising the simple <b>deterministic</b> <b>equation</b> alone. Because the multistage model removes patients from the hospital if they are deemed inappropriately placed, this model results in the projection of 5. 1 percent fewer hospital beds than the simple <b>deterministic</b> <b>equation</b> alone...|$|E

30|$|In this section, {{we first}} present a {{criterion}} concerning upper semicontinuity of non-autonomous random attractors {{with respect to}} a parameter in [28]. Similar results can be found in [29, 30] for <b>deterministic</b> <b>equations</b> and in [26, 31] for autonomous stochastic equations.|$|R
40|$|We {{carry out}} an {{analytic}} investigation of stochastic oscillations in a susceptible-infected-recovered model of disease spread on a network of $n$ cities. In the model a fraction $f_{jk}$ of individuals from city $k$ commute to city $j$, where they may infect, or be infected by, others. Starting from a continuous time Markov description of the model the <b>deterministic</b> <b>equations,</b> which are valid in the limit when the population of each city is infinite, are recovered. The stochastic fluctuations about the fixed point of these equations are derived by use of the van Kampen system-size expansion. The fixed point structure of the <b>deterministic</b> <b>equations</b> is remarkably simple: a unique non-trivial fixed point always exists and has the feature that the fraction of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals {{is the same for}} each city irrespective of its size. We find that the stochastic fluctuations have an analogously simple dynamics: all oscillations have a single frequency, equal to that found in the one city case. We interpret this phenomenon in terms of the properties of the spectrum of the matrix of the linear approximation of the <b>deterministic</b> <b>equations</b> at the fixed point.

25|$|Before many-worlds, reality {{had always}} been viewed as a single {{unfolding}} history. Many-worlds, however, views reality as a many-branched tree, wherein every possible quantum outcome is realised.

If {{the intensity of the}} noise simultaneously converges to 0 at a sufficiently fast rate, then the solutions converge to those of the <b>deterministic</b> <b>equation.</b> At the critical rate, the limiting solution is still deterministic, but it exhibits an additional damping term. ...|$|E
