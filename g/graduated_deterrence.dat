Buzzard was a founder member of both the Institute of Strategic Studies, and the Council of Christian Approaches to Defence and Disarmament. He frequently corresponded with Henry Kissinger, and developed the idea of “Graduated Deterrence.” <b>Graduated</b> <b>Deterrence</b> posited that one must issue a reasonable threat to one’s enemy that is also realizable and not so massive that no one believes that it will ever happen. During the 1960s {{he sat on the}} Minister of State for Disarmament, Lord Chalfont's Disarmament Panel. In 1967 he became Chairman of the British Council of Churches Committee on the Middle East.|$|E

Bivariate and multilevel modeling strategies were implemented. Findings revealed no discernable difference across multiple drug use, probationary, and recidivism measures between those randomized into the treatment condition and those receiving standard probation. In multivariate models, probationer age, employment status, and treatment participation improved some recidivism outcomes. Programmatic and sample characteristics are discussed regarding the lack of experimental effect. POLICY IMPLICATIONS These ﬁndings suggest that in designing and implementing deterrence-informed com- munity supervision approaches, policy makers and practitioners should consider offender attributes, the addition of employment and treatment-based programs and supports, and local justice system structures. The ﬁndings of this study ﬁt well with other emerging models of offender supervision, in particular, those that match services and programs based on offender risks and needs and those that recognize and address the heterogeneity of the offender population in developing supervision and service plans. Swift, certain, and fair supervision approaches for individuals under community supervision {{do not seem to be}} a “one-size-ﬁts-all” strategy. Understanding for whom they work and under what conditions has not yet been determined. In the meantime, policy makers and practitioners should endeavor to understand the risks and needs of their local offender population and the community supports that are available to improve offender outcomes and increase public safety.
