50|$|In the 1990s, P. Davis et al. {{published}} New Zealand Socioeconomic Index of Occupational Status, {{known as}} NZSEI. It {{was based on}} a 'returns to human capital' model of the stratification process and originally used data from the 1991 New Zealand Census (n=1,051,926) to generate scores for 97 occupational groups. It was later updated using 2006 Census data. NZSEI is a linear scale of ranked occupation, produced using an algorithm involving age, income and education, and aggregated to six discrete groupings (called Socio-economic Status, SES) to <b>enable</b> <b>comparison</b> with E-I and ISEI.|$|E

50|$|The {{work of the}} CBS follows internationally {{accepted}} standards which <b>enable</b> <b>comparison</b> {{of statistical}} information with other countries. It gathers current, monthly, quarterly and annually data on the national economy (production, consumption, capital formation, labor productivity, savings), the balance of payments and foreign trade, the activity of different economic branches (agriculture, manufacturing, construction, transport, commerce and services, etc.), the price of goods and services, the population, family size, employment, education, health, crime, government services and more. The CBS also conducts a Census of Population and Housing every ten years, as well as periodic and one-time surveys {{on a variety of}} subjects.|$|E
50|$|To achieve this, {{literature}} on the topic suggest that donors should agree on adopting a standardized format for providing information on volume, allocation and results, such as the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI), or other similar standards, and commit to improve recipient countries' databases with technical, financial and informational support. The format should be easily downloadable and with sufficient disaggregation to <b>enable</b> <b>comparison</b> with other data. Making aid data public and comparable among donors, {{would be likely to}} encourage a process of positive emulation towards a better usage of public funds. After all, official development assistance (ODA) is a voluntary transfer that depends on the support of donor country taxpayers. Donors should therefore consider improving the transparency and traceability of aid funds also as a way of increasing engagement and support toward aid inside their own country. Moreover, a generalized adoption of IATI would ensure the publication of aid information in a timely way, the compatibility with developing countries' budgets and the reliability of future projections, which would have a strong and positive effect on the predictability of aid.|$|E

5000|$|Auxiliary {{specifications}} <b>enable</b> <b>comparison</b> {{of different}} social states by {{each member of}} society in preference satisfaction. These help define Pareto efficiency, which holds if all alternatives have been exhausted to put {{at least one person}} in a more preferred position with no one put in a less preferred position. Bergson described an [...] "economic welfare increase" [...] (later called a Pareto improvement) as at least one individual moving to a more preferred position with everyone else indifferent. The social welfare function could then be specified in a substantively individualistic sense to derive Pareto efficiency (optimality). Paul Samuelson (2004, p. 26) notes that Bergson's function [...] "could derive Pareto optimality conditions as necessary but not sufficient for defining interpersonal normative equity." [...] Still, Pareto efficiency could also characterize one dimension of a particular social welfare function with distribution of commodities among individuals characterizing another dimension. As Bergson noted, a welfare improvement from the social welfare function could come from the [...] "position of some individuals" [...] improving at the expense of others. That social welfare function could then be described as characterizing an equity dimension.|$|E
5000|$|In 2015 {{an article}} by {{epidemiologist}} Thomas Perneger examining the curse was published in The BMJ. The study was based on statistical analysis {{of the results of}} World Road Champions and winners of the Giro di Lombardia (which was used as a comparison) in the riders' winning seasons and for the two years afterwards (to <b>enable</b> <b>comparison</b> of results before, during and after the supposed curse was in effect). The patterns of data were compared to four statistical models - the [...] "spotlight effect", based on the theory that the apparent curse is due to increased public attention on the World Champion rather than a decline in success, the [...] "marked man" [...] hypothesis which stipulates that the current wearer of the jersey is more closely marked by rivals during their year as champion, the [...] "regression to the mean" [...] model which supposes that random variation in success rates will mean that a highly successful season for a rider is likely to be followed by less successful years, and a model combining the last two theories. The study found that the regression to the mean model was the one that fit the data best, for winners of both the World Championship and Il Lombardia, concluding that the curse probably does not exist. The author related the idea of the curse to medical professionals conflating correlation with causation when considering the effect of treatment on a patient.|$|E
5000|$|He {{is popular}} among his pupils, who affectionately call him 'Stevie'. They like {{the view that}} Dr. Spurr holds about how {{to spend time in}} the holidays: he {{believes}} in the three 'R's - rest, revision, reflection. Spurr has stated that A-level exams may fail talented pupils, especially in the Humanities; and Westminster has consequently switched to Cambridge Pre-U exams in 9 subjects, which he describes as [...] "so much more stimulating to teach and learn". He is also a great proponent of scientific education. [...] In another two subjects his pupils follow International A-levels, which, together with the Pre-Us, <b>enable</b> <b>comparison</b> with the best schools world-wide, since Spurr aims to educate pupils to become the successful global citizens of the future. He believes that British education needs to take careful notice of increasingly high international standards, and this is a theme on which he has given talks in the UK, Singapore, the US and China. From 2006-2013 Spurr was the Chairman of ISEB, the board that produces and regulates the Common Entrance examination, where he has always insisted on academic integrity and rigour. According to Tatler magazine, Spurr also believes in academic research for its own intrinsic sake. At Eton, Clifton and Westminster, he has always worked to raise academic standards. He has also looked to identify and encourage academically ambitious pupils in the state sector, through fund-raising for bursary programmes and by establishing the Eton-Harlesden Summer School in 1986, the Clifton Summer School in 2001 and, most recently, he set up the Harris-Westminster Sixth Form Academy, a joint project between Westminster School and Harris Federation, which opened in 2014 and has been judged Outstanding in its first Inspection by Ofsted.|$|E
