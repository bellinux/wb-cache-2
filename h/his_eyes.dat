5|$|Giridhar {{lost his}} {{eyesight}} {{at the age}} of two months. On 24 March 1950, <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> were infected by trachoma. There were no advanced facilities for treatment in the village, so he was taken to an elderly woman in a nearby village who was known to cure trachoma boils to provide relief. The woman applied a paste of myrobalan to Giridhar's eyes to burst the lumps, but <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> started bleeding, resulting in the loss of his eyesight. His family took him to the King George Hospital in Lucknow, where <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> were treated for 21 days, but his sight could not be restored. Various Ayurvedic, Homeopathic, Allopathic, and other practitioners were approached in Sitapur, Lucknow, and Bombay, but to no avail. Rambhadracharya has been blind ever since.
