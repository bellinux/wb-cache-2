5|$|Mechanical theater (driven by {{carriage}} wheels): The inventors of {{the field}} mill mentioned above, Xie Fei and Wei Mengbian of the Later Zhao (319–351 AD), also invented an intricate mechanical theater mounted on a carriage, its figures operated by motive power (i.e. simply advancing the carriage forward). From 335 to 345 AD, they worked at the court of the ethnic-Jie emperor Shi Hu (334–349). The vehicle they crafted was a four-wheeled and 6m (20ft) long carriage that was about 3m (10ft) wide. On it rested a large golden Buddha statue with a Daoist statue continually rubbing his front with his mechanical hand. The Buddha was also surrounded by ten wooden Daoists who rotated around him in a circuit, periodically bowing to him, saluting him, and throwing incense into a censer. Above the Buddha were nine dragon-headed <b>faucets</b> which <b>spouted</b> water. Like the field mill and the pounding cart of these two inventors, when the carriage halted, so did all of its moving components of mechanical statues and <b>spouting</b> <b>faucets.</b>|$|R
50|$|Alexander is {{essentially}} composed of one wide building sectioned off by wings. The Fine Arts wing {{consists of the}} theater, a band room, and a chorus room. The 100 wing hosts English and foreign language classrooms. The 200 wing hosts math and history classrooms. The 300 wing consists of science classrooms. Each classroom on the 300 wing has laboratory stations (water <b>faucet</b> and gas <b>spout).</b> The 400 wing (formerly known as the Freshman Academy) was added in the 2000s due to the rising number of incoming freshmen. The 400 wing is now a mixture of academic classrooms. The business wing hosts six large computer labs with classes ranging from Broadcast and Video Production to Web Page Design. The back wing hosts an art room equipped with a darkroom, {{as well as a}} nursing room, and a kitchen which enables the school to offer food classes.|$|R
40|$|Samples {{obtained}} from plumbing systems of hospitals, nonhospital institutions and homes were cultured for Legionella spp. {{by plating the}} samples directly on a selective medium. Swab samples {{were taken from the}} inner surfaces of <b>faucet</b> assemblies (aerators, <b>spouts,</b> and valve seats), showerheads, and shower pipes. Water and sediment were collected from the bottom of hot-water tanks. Legionella pneumophila serogroups 1, 5, and 6 were recovered from plumbing fixtures of the hospitals and nonhospital institutions and one of five homes. The legionellae (7 to 13, 850 colony-forming units per ml) were also present in water and sediment from hot-water tanks maintained at 30 to 54 degrees C, but not in those maintained at 71 and 77 degrees C. Legionella micdadei was isolated from one tank. Thus legionellae are present in hot-water tanks which are maintained at warm temperatures or whose design results in warm temperatures {{at the bottom of the}} tanks. We hypothesize that hot-water tanks are a breeding site and a major source of L. pneumophila for the contamination of plumbing systems. The existence of these bacteria in the plumbing systems and tanks was not necessarily associated with disease. The extent of the hazard of this contamination needs to be delineated...|$|R
