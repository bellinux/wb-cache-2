25|$|The <b>first</b> <b>pipe</b> organ at Scots' {{was built}} in 1883 by Hill and Son. It was rebuilt and {{enlarged}} in 1910 by George Fincham and Sons and rebuilt again in 1959. The organ was removed for storage in 1999. The present organ {{was built in}} 1998 by Rieger Orgelbau, Schwarzach, Austria.|$|E
500|$|The <b>first</b> <b>pipe</b> organ in the church, {{built by}} Harris and Byfield in 1726, was of three manuals and 26stops. It was rebuilt in 1829 {{and again in}} 1867 {{on either side of}} the chancel. In 1912 a four-manual, 71-stop organ having over 4,300pipes was {{installed}} by Harrison & Harrison. Towards the end of his life Arthur Harrison said that he regarded the organ at St Mary Redcliffe as his [...] "finest and most characteristic work". The organ remains essentially as he designed it in 1911.|$|E

Vihar reservoir was the <b>first</b> <b>piped</b> water supply scheme of Mumbai.|$|R
25|$|Wellington's <b>first</b> <b>piped</b> {{water supply}} {{came from a}} spring in 1867. Greater Wellington Regional Council now {{supplies}} Lower Hutt, Porirua, Upper Hutt and Wellington with up to 220 million litres a day.

500|$|Henry was {{responsible}} for a substantial expansion of the royal justice system. In England, Henry drew on the existing Anglo-Saxon system of justice, local government and taxes, but strengthened it with additional central governmental institutions. Roger of Salisbury began to develop the royal exchequer after 1110, using it to collect and audit revenues from the King's sheriffs in the shires. Itinerant justices began to emerge under Henry, travelling around the country managing eyre courts, and many more laws were formally recorded. Henry gathered increasing revenue from the expansion of royal justice, both from fines and from fees. The <b>first</b> <b>Pipe</b> Roll that {{is known to have}} survived dates from 1130, recording royal expenditures. Henry reformed the coinage in 1107, 1108 and in 1125, inflicting harsh corporal punishments to English coiners who had been found guilty of debasing the currency. In Normandy, Henry restored law and order after 1106, operating through a body of Norman justices and an exchequer system similar to that in England. Norman institutions grew in scale and scope under Henry, although less quickly than in England. Many of the officials that ran Henry's system were termed [...] "new men", relatively low-born individuals who rose through the ranks as administrators, managing justice or the royal revenues.|$|E

2500|$|By 1860, the {{congregation}} {{had grown to}} 87 members, and fundraising for a permanent church building began. Property was purchased in 1862. The congregation's first permanent building was completed in 1864, at 3rd and Washington streets, and was dedicated on May 22. It included the <b>first</b> <b>pipe</b> organ in Portland. A 1,052-pound bell was donated by Caroline E. Jagger Corbett, wife of Senator Henry W. Corbett. It was made by Meneely & Company (of Troy, New York) from bronze Civil War cannons. A 1987 article in The Oregonian said that in 1865, the bell [...] "rang out {{the news that the}} Civil War had ended. Five days later, it tolled for President Lincoln's death." ...|$|E

50|$|Melbourne {{received}} its <b>first</b> <b>piped</b> water, from the Yan Yean Reservoir, in 1857. Water shortages {{in the late}} 1870s led {{to the construction of}} the Toorourrong scheme in 1882 - 1885, and the Maroondah Aqueduct in 1886 - 1891. In 1888 {{a large part of the}} upper Yarra valley was reserved for water supply purposes.|$|R

2500|$|The <b>first</b> <b>pipe</b> organ, {{installed}} {{shortly after}} the cathedral was built, came from France and had one manual and a pedal clavier. [...] The second organ, installed in 1885, was built in England as the gift of parishioner Godfrey Rhodes, featuring great, swell and pedal organs. [...] The large statue of Saint Cecilia, patroness of sacred music, {{was placed on the}} casing in front of the organ in 1906. [...] Because of wear, the Vicariate decided to move the 1885 instrument next door to the Columbus Welfare Building for use during choir rehearsal. [...] A new instrument, the third and present one, consisting of great, swell, choir, and pedal organs was installed in the choir loft by organbuilder Alfred G. Tickner of the Aeolian-Skinner Organ Company of Boston. [...] This instrument was solemnly blessed on September 9, 1934, by Msgr. Stephen Alencastre, followed by a dedicatory recital by organist Don George, broadcast over radio station KGU in Honolulu.|$|E

50|$|The {{history of}} the Company {{can be traced back}} to Folkestone’s <b>first</b> <b>piped</b> water supply.

60|$|Though Scrymgeour only {{painted in}} watercolors, I think--I {{never looked at}} his pictures--he had one superb idea, which we often advised him to carry out.

His idea was to paint Shakespeare smoking his <b>first</b> <b>pipe</b> of the Arcadia Mixture.|$|E
25|$|The <b>first</b> <b>piped</b> {{water systems}} were {{completed}} {{during the colonial}} period in the 1930s. Water-borne sewerage was introduced after 1937. The construction of new facilities increased from 1950 to 1965 under the framework of large national development programs. Later, the existing systems were only partly maintained and no new facilities were constructed until 1990. According to a UN-Water document, by 1990 the urban water infrastructure served less than 10 percent of the population in large towns.|$|R
50|$|In Germany, a British private water {{company had}} set up the <b>first</b> <b>piped</b> water system and {{treatment}} plant in Berlin in 1852, but the city, dissatisfied {{with the lack of}} investment in particular in sewerage, cancelled the contract in 1873. In 1887 Gelsenwasser was created, which remains an important regional water supplier in the Ruhr district. The German water sector has always been dominated by municipally owned utilities. Despite this, the water system of Berlin was partially privatized in 1999 for fiscal reasons.|$|R

HMS Victorys active career ended in 1812, when she was moored in Portsmouth Harbour and used as a depot ship. The town of Gosport contributed £75 a year towards the ship's maintenance. In 1818, John Pounds began teaching working class children in the country's first ragged school. In 1820, the Portsea Improvement Commissioners installed gas street lighting throughout the town, followed by Old Portsmouth three years later.|$|R
