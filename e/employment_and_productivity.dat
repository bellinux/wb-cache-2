40|$|Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is an important}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} worldwide. Some studies suggest that COPD may affect work, however this relationship remains poorly understood. Various methods are used in this thesis to investigate the impact of COPD on <b>employment</b> <b>and</b> work <b>productivity.</b> Findings from the systematic review showed that patients with COPD had lower <b>employment</b> <b>and</b> higher sickness absence rates compared to those without COPD. From the cross-sectional analyses, breathlessness and occupational exposures to vapours, gases, dusts and fumes (VGDF) were identified as the main modifiable factors associated with unemployment <b>and</b> poor work <b>productivity</b> in COPD patients. Finally, few patients agreed {{to take part in the}} occupational intervention. Although most participating patients received a range of recommendations, these were not taken up by all. Potential benefits and suggestions for future occupational interventions were identified. This work confirms that having COPD adversely affects patients' rates of <b>employment</b> <b>and</b> work <b>productivity.</b> Future interventions should focus on managing breathlessness and reducing occupational exposures to VGDF to improve work ability <b>and</b> work <b>productivity</b> among patients with COPD. The development of novel interventions should draw upon lessons learned from the feasibility study reported in this thesis...|$|R

50|$|The {{shrinking}} {{of urban}} populations indicates a changing {{of economic and}} planning conditions of a city. Cities begin to 'shrink' from economic decline, usually resulting from war, debt, or lack of production and work force. Population decline affects {{a large number of}} communities, both communities that are far removed from and deep within large urban centers. These communities usually consist of native people and long-term residents, so the initial population is not large.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze whether the employment/productivity profile of growth {{as well as}} its sectoral pattern matter for poverty reduction.

We find that, in the short run, while the overall employment intensity of growth does not matter for poverty reduction, the sectoral pattern of <b>employment</b> growth <b>and</b> <b>productivity</b> growth is important. While employment intensive growth in the secondary sector appears to be associated with decreases in poverty, employment intensive growth in agriculture increases poverty. Similarly productivity intensive growth in agriculture is associated with poverty reduction. The results suggest that focusing on the aggregate employment elasticity of growth, alone, as a way to reduce poverty may lead to misleading policy recommendations and more be gained by focusing on secondary sector <b>employment</b> growth <b>and</b> <b>productivity</b> intensive growth in agriculture. 1 Poverty Reduction Group, World Ban...|$|R

The model implies a factor difference of 10. 8 in aggregate labor productivity between the richest and the poorest 5 percent of the countries in the world, leaving the unexplained factor at 3. 2. Overall, this two-sector framework performs much better than a single-sector growth model in explaining observed differences in international productivity. land value, building value, property assessment, urban land assessment. ...|$|R
