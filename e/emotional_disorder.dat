Curs: 2014 / 2015 A {{growing body}} of {{research}} on transdiagnostic cognitive-behavior therapy protocols for <b>emotional</b> <b>disorders</b> (depression and anxiety disorders) has emerged in recent years, showing that these protocols can be as effective as well-established disorder-specific psychotherapy. Negative affect and positive affect are two higher-order dimensions that {{play an important role in}} <b>emotional</b> <b>disorders.</b> A common denominator among transdiagnostic treatment protocols for <b>emotional</b> <b>disorders</b> is that they mainly target negative affectivity, but the inclusion in these protocols of treatment components that more directly address the regulation of positive affectivity has not yet received empirical attention. We have developed a transdiagnostic protocol for <b>emotional</b> <b>disorders</b> that incorporates, as an innovative feature, a specific treatment component to more directly up-regulate positive affectivity. The protocol has been developed in both face-to-face and Internet-based formats. In this study, we present data from a clinical sample of eleven patients with different <b>emotional</b> <b>disorders</b> who received this transdiagnostic treatment protocol delivered in a blended format (face-to-face therapy plus online therapy). Results showed that the protocol was effective for the treatment of a variety of <b>emotional</b> <b>disorders,</b> with overall large effect sizes for positive and negative affectivity, and other measures such as depression, anxiety sensitivity, quality of life and two higher-order personality dimensions (neuroticism and extraversion) at post-treatment. Moreover, the treatment gains were maintained at the 3 -month follow-up. Data on the acceptance of the intervention by participants are also presented.

A second cause is a traumatic brain injury in which damage is usually done to the hippocampus or surrounding cortices. It may also be caused by a shocking event or an <b>emotional</b> <b>disorder.</b> Illness, though much rarer, can also cause anterograde amnesia if it causes encephalitis, which is the inflammation of brain tissue. There are several types of encephalitis: one such is herpes simplex encephalitis (HSV), which, if left untreated, can lead to neurological deterioration. How HSV gains access to the brain is unknown; the virus shows a distinct predilection for certain parts of the brain. Initially, it is present in the limbic cortices; it may then spread to the adjacent frontal and temporal lobes. Damage to specific areas can result in reduced or eliminated ability to encode new explicit memories, giving rise to anterograde amnesia. Patients suffering from anterograde amnesia may have episodic, semantic, or both types of explicit memory impaired for events after the trauma that caused the amnesia. This suggests that memory consolidation for different types of memory takes place in different regions of the brain. Despite this, current knowledge on human memory is still insufficient to [...] "map out" [...] the wiring of a human brain to discover which parts of which lobe are responsible for the various episodic and semantic knowledge within a person's memory.|$|E
5000|$|In 1979, Giordano {{was hired}} as an {{assistant}} hockey coach at the University of Michigan working under head coach Dan Farrell. Giordano was reunited at Michigan with John Blum, who had joined the Wolverines after graduating from Notre Dame High School. [...] During the 1979-1980 hockey season, Giordano {{was in charge of}} the Wolverines' power play. Giordano was credited with molding the unit into [...] "the most potent power play in the country," [...] scoring on 40% of power play opportunities. In the spring of 1980, Farrell resigned as Michigan's head coach and was replaced by former Wolverine hockey star Wilf Martin. In the fall of 1980, the Michigan hockey team became embroiled in two major controversies. First, a hazing scandal dominated press coverage of the team in October. Veteran players reportedly forced a freshman player to drink large quantities of gin, vodka and beer, stripped him of his clothes, shaved his body from the neck down, covered him with jam, eggs and cologne, dumped him in the trunk of a car, and left him nearly unconscious in freezing weather. This was later found not to be true and the players actually returned the player, (J T Todd) to his dorm. [...] Todd, who was walk-on from Detroit left the team. [...] Second, head coach Martin developed health problems, reported in the press to be an <b>emotional</b> <b>disorder,</b> during the exhibition season. [...] Martin coached only two games during the 1980-1981 season, and announced his resignation in late November 1980. Giordano took over, initially as interim head coach, for a Michigan hockey team in crisis. Giordano was praised for his efforts in leading the team to a 23-17 record during the 1980-1981 season. The Michigan Daily noted:"The Wayne State graduate was faced with a very adverse set of circumstances from the outset, including the loss of Michigan's top three scorers, being picked to finish last in the WCHA by pre-season pollsters, and extremely negative publicity surrounding the hazing incident."Athletic director Don Canham added, [...] "He took over in a bad situation and he's done a remarkably good job." [...] Giordano was named permanent head coach in early February 1981. [...] At the end of the 1980-1981 season, he was named collegiate Coach of the Year by The Hockey News, WCHA Coach of the Year by The Denver Post, and WCHA Co-Coach of the Year with John MacInnes by the vote of WCHA coaches. In Giordano's second year as head coach, the Michigan hockey team moved from the highly competitive Western Collegiate Hockey Association ("WCHA") to the less-competitive Central Collegiate Hockey Association ("CCHA"). With the change in conferences, [...] "the conventional wisdom was that the Wolverines would dominate the new circuit behind their successful young coach." [...] Instead, the Wolverines finished in fourth place in the CCHA during the 1981-1982 season with a record of 18-15-5.;The team continued to move in the wrong direction in Giordano's third and fourth years as head coach, finishing in ninth place in the CCHA both years with records of 14-22-0 and 14-22-1. Giordano's position as head coach was further undermined by lagging attendance (Michigan averaged approximately 3,000 fans per game during Giordano's final two years as head coach) and a players' mutiny. Giordano had a reputation as a disciplinarian. Among other things, he strictly enforced curfews and ordered extra 6 a.m. practices when the team failed to perform. He was also alleged to have stripped seven players of their scholarships. In the spring of 1984, all 22 Michigan hockey players signed a petition listing their grievances and stating that Giordano was [...] "an embarrassment to all of us in front of other coaches and players." [...] Athletic director Don Canham later recalled:"I never talk to players about their coaches. I coached myself, and I know enough not to do that. But when all 22 players walked into my office the second time with a signed petition to say this situation is intolerable - well, I just had to let him go. He just never could get along with the players." [...] In his history of the Michigan hockey program, historian John U. Bacon noted: [...] "In reporting the decision, the Michigan Daily described Giordano as being 'very unpopular with the players, parents, fans and alumni' - which didn't leave many in his corner." [...] Giordano was replaced as the head coach of the Michigan men's ice hockey team by current head coach Red Berenson.|$|E

Using data from a large population health survey, the present study aimed to quantify the burden of <b>emotional</b> <b>disorders</b> (depression and anxiety) on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in the region of Catalonia (Spain) for evidence-informed policy making. Methods: Regression models were used to estimate the impact of <b>emotional</b> <b>disorders</b> on HRQoL, controlling by socioeconomic factors and somatic health problems. The rate of <b>emotional</b> <b>disorders</b> was based on the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 12) and quality of life scores were based on the EQ- 5 D. Results: The impact of <b>emotional</b> <b>disorders</b> on HRQoL was equal to a reduction of 0. 17 in the EQ- 5 D score. Translation of this individual impact to population figures yielded a total loss of 78, 742 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for 2006. This strong impact highlights the need for global policies aiming to reduce this burden.

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from BioMed Central via the DOI in this record. BACKGROUND: Anxiety and {{depression}} are common in young people and are associated with a range of adverse outcomes. Research has suggested a relationship between <b>emotional</b> <b>disorder</b> and poor school attendance, and thus poor attendance may serve as a red flag for children at risk of <b>emotional</b> <b>disorder.</b> This systematic review aims to investigate the association between child and adolescent <b>emotional</b> <b>disorder</b> and poor attendance at school. METHODS: We will search electronic databases from a variety of disciplines including medicine, psychology, education and social sciences, as well as sources of grey literature, to identify any quantitative studies that investigate the relationship between <b>emotional</b> <b>disorder</b> and school attendance. <b>Emotional</b> <b>disorder</b> may refer to diagnoses of mood or anxiety disorders using standardised diagnostic measures, or measures of depression, anxiety or "internalising symptoms" using a continuous scale. Definitions for school non-attendance vary, and we aim to include any relevant terminology, including attendance, non-attendance, school refusal, school phobia, absenteeism and truancy. Two independent reviewers will screen identified papers and extract data from included studies. We will assess the risk of bias of included studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Random effects meta-analysis will be used to pool quantitative findings when studies use the same measure of association, otherwise a narrative synthesis approach will be used. DISCUSSION: This systematic review will provide a detailed synthesis of evidence regarding the relationship between childhood <b>emotional</b> <b>disorder</b> and poor attendance at school. Understanding this relationship has the potential to assist in the development of strategies to improve the identification of and intervention for this vulnerable group.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the role of {{personality}} characteristics in service utilisation for mental health problems. We investigate whether neuroticism: 1) predicts the use of primary and specialised care services for mental health problems, independently of whether a person has an emotional disorder; and 2) modifies any association between <b>emotional</b> <b>disorder</b> and service use. Data were derived from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS) a prospective cohort study in the general population aged 18 - 64. Neuroticism was recorded at baseline, and <b>emotional</b> <b>disorder</b> and service use at 12 -month follow-up, in a representative sample (N= 7076), using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. People with high neuroticism were more likely to receive care in the specialised mental health sector, and after entry to care they made more visits to the services, whether or not they had an <b>emotional</b> <b>disorder.</b> If they had an <b>emotional</b> <b>disorder,</b> their likelihood of receiving specialised mental health care showed an additional increase. Neuroticism also predicted the use of primary care for mental health problems, but greater numbers of visits were made only by clients with both high neuroticism and an <b>emotional</b> <b>disorder.</b> It would be useful to incorporate personality characteristics into models to understand variations in service utilisation for mental health problems. The findings suggest that professionals would be wise to focus not just on their clients' emotional problems and disorders, but also on strengthening their problem-solving abilities through approaches like cognitive behavioural therapy...|$|E
