40|$|Almost all {{government}} policies have spatially differentiated impacts {{that are usually}} rather unintentional and often {{in conflict with the}} goals of spatial policies. Calculations based on data from an empirical study of 693 firms belonging to the pollution control industry in the Federal Republic of Germany show that <b>industrial</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>policy</b> exerts some significant influences on different types of regions, especially favoring 'structurally sound regions'. A benefit tax/transfer scheme is designed to reconcile environmental and regional policy goals, to meet environmental targets, {{and at the same time}} to maintain the differential levels of financial assistance allocated to the dissimilar types of regions. Since the goals and instruments of environmental and regional policy are overlapping to an ever-greater extent, such problems (and perhaps such solutions) should be seriously considered in order to avoid inconsistencies between closely related environmental and regional policies. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} Dutch <b>industrial</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>policy</b> on {{emissions}} of Volatile Organic Substances (VOC) {{in the last}} 15 years and provides insight into VOC emissions in the Netherlands in 2010. Up till now, voluntary agreements between public authorities and industrial branches {{within the framework of}} the Dutch VOC 2000 programme, called KWS 2000, have made an important contribution to the VOC policy. Voluntary agreements are concluded to be reasonably successful. The target for reducing industrial VOC emissions by at least 55 % between 1981 and 2000 through the implementation of environmental technologies has been reached. Different factors of influence (e. g. policy instruments) on the implementation process were characterised for five important industrial branches. A new expert-support computer model was used as a tool to simulate the implementation of environmental technologies and to provide insight into the basic assumptions and data used. The success of the voluntary agreements was found in the embedding of the agreements in the practice of granting and enforcing permits in combination with the availability and affordability (from a company point of view) of technologies, and the compatibility of these with the existing technological system. Considering the present environmental policy pressure on VOC emission reduction, about 15 % emission reduction at the most can be achieved between 2000 and 2010 in the evaluated branches of industry. Intensification of policy pressure could lead to about 30 - 35 % reduction. This intensification is needed to reaching the VOC emission ceiling for the industrial sector in the Netherlands, as agreed in the 4 th National Environmental Policy Plan (NMP- 4) ...|$|E

That is, what has influenced Norwegian aquaculture policy in spatial terms? This question is answered by looking at how allocation of space has developed from the early 1970 s and to the present, what actors were involved, what arguments did they use and what was the spatial outcome of the chosen policies. Through a literature review, I have shown how discourses of regional <b>policy,</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>policy,</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>policy</b> and health policy have affected the spatial allocation of aquaculture licenses in the past.

40|$|This paper {{therefore}} looks closer into climate {{gas emission}} and {{the shift to}} non-fossil energy in Sweden. What types of organizations are behind the shift to non-fossil energy use, what are the relative effects on emissions, {{to what extent can}} these interactive dynamics be considered eco-innovations? Do these effects vary between public and private organizations, and if so, can they be related to specific institutions and policies? Methods include statistical survival analyses, in particular Cox regression. These analyses inform us why energy sources shift. Results indicate that wood fuel and solid waste increase as sources of energy while fossil oil has decreased between 2003 and 2010. This result is in line with <b>industrial</b> and <b>environmental</b> <b>policies</b> of the Swedish governments that present these facts as institutionally and policy-related ‘green innovation’. However, our analysis contests such a conclusion and it is noticed that the shift to non-fossil sources of energy has not led to verifiable decreases in green-house gas emissions. Results instead suggest that ‘green’ innovation of non-fossil energy was mostly the effect of low-tech innovation in public organizations with no fundamental effect on CO 2 emissions. © Springer International Publishing AG, Part of Springer Science+Business Media 2015 ”Miljöinnovationer i det svenska innovationssystemet...|$|R

Environmental innovation may spur from exogenous driving forces, like policy intervention, and/or from endogenous factors associated to firm market and management strategies. Despite the crucial importance of research in this field, empirical evidence at firm microeconomic level, for various reasons, is still scarce. Microeconomic-based analysis is needed in order to assess what forces are lying behind environmental innovation at the level of the firm, where innovative practices emerge and are adopted. The paper exploits information deriving from two surveys conducted on a sample of manufacturing firms in Emilia Romagna region -Northern Italy- in 2002 and 2004, located in a district-intense local production system. New evidence is provided by testing a set of hypotheses, concerning the influence of: (i) firm structural variables; (ii) environmental R&D; (iii) <b>environmental</b> <b>policy</b> pressure and regulatory costs; (iv) past firm performances; (v) networking activities, (vi) other non-environmental techno-organizational innovations and (vii) quality/nature of industrial relations. We estimate input and output-based environmental innovation reduced form specifications in order to test the set of hypotheses. The applied investigation shows that environmental innovation drivers, both at input and output level, are found within exogenous factors and endogenous elements concerning the firm and its activities/strategies within and outside its natural boundaries.

The economic development, environment, and employment aspects of sustainable development are emphasized.

The article argues that <b>industrial</b> <b>policy,</b> <b>environmental</b> law and <b>policy,</b> and trade initiatives must be ‘opened up’ by expanding the practice of multi-purpose policy design, and that these policies must be integrated as well.
