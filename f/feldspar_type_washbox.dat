Solution is very selective and may result in considerable reduction {{in the amount of}} feldspar and signi:Hcant change in proportion of <b>feldspar</b> <b>types.</b> Solution of <b>feldspar</b> in sedimentary rocks is common in some formations and contributes significantly to the porosity. Shenhav (1971) described small voids in feldspars in some Cretaceous sandstones in Israel but generally the role that the {{solution of}} feldspar may play in increasing reservoir porosity has not been stressed.

Obsidian coming from this area is basically characterized by the presence of <b>feldspar</b> phenocrystals: two <b>types</b> of obsidian, one black and the other olive green, are also recognized. Under a microscope analysis the latter obsidian shows needle-like iso-oriented inclusions and opaque phenocrystals [12].

40|$|Mafic microgranular {{enclaves}} {{produced by}} co-mingling between minette and syenite magmas {{are found in}} the Piquiri Syenite, southern Brazil. These enclaves were crystallized under upper mantle conditions. K-clinopyroxene and pyrope are among the early-crystallized phases, suggesting an initial pressure around 5 GPa. The mineralogy of minettes comprises phenocrysts of magnesium biotite and diopside, occasionally apatite, in a groundmass formed by these minerals plus alkali <b>feldspar.</b> Two <b>types</b> of apatites are observed: (i) euhedral grains, as inclusions or groundmass constituents, and (ii) aciculate crystals formed during undercooling of mafic magma. Substitutional schemes suggested for these apatites are Si ⇆ P in the tetrahedral site, and Sr and LREE replacing Ca. La, Ce, Nd, and Sr concentrations reveal that these elements are extremely enriched in apatite. Partition coefficients between early-crystallized apatites and estimated melt compositions are DLa (11. 8 - 30. 6), DCe (16. 1 - 33), DNd (12 - 31) and DSr (5. 1 - 8. 2). Apatite concentrates the LREE up to 200 times compared to clinopyroxene, even higher values were determined for ap/mica partitioning. The ap/cpx and ap/mica partition coefficients for undercooled minerals are close to the values determined for the near-liquidus phases, which indicates constant behavior of LREE and Sr between apatite-clinopyroxene-mica parageneses and minette liquids. Furthermore, these partitioning data preclude any chemical diffusion of these elements between minette and syenite magmas during co-mingling...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the high {{temperature}} behavior of water and hydroxide in quartz, feldspar, topaz, zircon, muscovite, cordierite, and beryl using high temperature infrared spectroscopy. We have directly observed processes such as dehydration and changes in hydrogen speciation. In some minerals trace hydroxyl and water speciation and properties at temperatures of geologic interest can be dramatically different from those at 25 °C. In muscovite, no changes in speciation occur prior to dehydration at 750 °C, whereas in topaz hydroxyl sites interconvert at 500 °C. In metamict zircon strongly hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl is preferentially lost from a continuum of sites during continuous dehydration occurring from 400 ° to 900 °C. There are only minor changes in the O-H region spectrum of natural quartz at the ɑ-β transition point. In <b>feldspar</b> one <b>type</b> of molecular water is lost at 200 °C, and at 600 ° to 800 ° a second water type converts irreversibly to a new hydrous species. Changes at high temperature common to the infrared absorption bands of all minerals studied are: broadening, a shift to lower wave numbers, and a slight decrease in integral intensity. Temperature coefficients for 0 -H stretching peak shifts range from 0 to - 0. 045 cm^(- 1) /°C. Lattice modes also broaden and shift to lower wave numbers, typically with temperature coefficients of about - 0. 03 cm-^(- 1) /°C...|$|R
30|$|The Ca 2 + {{concentration}} in the groundwater ranges from 4 to 1600  mgl− 1. It is higher in SWM and lower during POM. The Ca 2 + may be derived from calcite, hornblende and plagioclase minerals. Mg 2 + concentration ranges from 2.4 to 1248  mgl− 1 in the groundwater samples of the study area. Relatively higher concentration of Mg 2 + is observed in the SWM season and lesser during POM season. Higher levels of Mg 2 + in groundwater is seen in HBG and charnockite region located along {{the western part of}} the study area that have Mg 2 + affluent pyroxene as the predominant mineral (Chidambaram et al. 2012). Also, the higher level of Mg 2 + seen along the coastal zone perhaps may be because of the influence of seawater intrusion (Subba Rao et al. 2012; Singaraja et al. 2014). Na+ concentration ranges from 10 to 6212  mgl− 1 which is higher in the PRM and lesser in NEM. The main sources of Na+ in groundwater are hornblende biotite gneiss, charnockite, plagioclase <b>feldspar</b> rock <b>types</b> seen along {{the western part of the}} region (Srinivasamoorthy et al. 2009; Thivya et al. 2013; Venkatramanan et al. 2013) as well as seawater intrusion along the coastal region (Thilagavathi et al. 2014). K+ concentration ranges between 0.5 and 520  mgl− 1 with higher values observed in POM. At a few locations, abnormalities are seen irrespective of seasons possibly due to weathering and urban landfill leaching (Thivya et al. 2015; Selvam et al. 2016).|$|R

The provenance of middle to late Miocene clastic sediments of Cibao basin in northern Hispaniola has been assessed via integrated methods including detrital framework modes, clay mineral assemblages and ratios, the composition of individual feldspar grains, and the distribution and abundance of trace elements and rare earth elements (REE). Framework modes of middle to late Miocene clastic samples suggest a source mainly from recycled orogen provenance. Individual feldspar compositions determined by electron microprobe analysis indicate derivation from plutonic, metamorphic, and possibly volcanic sources. Trace elements and REE data demonstrate that the middle and late Miocene sediments in the central to eastern Cibao basin display two geochemically distinctive type features. Type 1 sediments, with relatively lower total REE, Th, Sc and Cr+Ni values, correspond to relatively higher chlorite/illite ratio and varied <b>feldspar</b> abundance. <b>Type</b> 2 sediments, with relatively higher total REE, Th, Sc and Cr+Ni values, are consistent with lower chlorite/illite ratio and lower percentage of feldspar. These geochemical characteristics suggest that middle to late Miocene clastic sediments in Cibao basin are related to an active continental margins setting.

40|$|The pegmatites in the Sierras Pampeanas of Argentina are {{classified}} into four main types {{on the basis}} of their internal structure, composition, and mineral paragenesis. The first type is distinguished by oligoclase-bearing wall zones and the second type by intermediate zones of quartz, plagioclase and microcline, and by higher overall percentage of potassium <b>feldspar.</b> The third <b>type</b> is characterized by very simple zonal structure, by a greater diversity and abundance of accessory minerals and by the presence of sodium-potassium replacement units. In the fourth type spodumene is present, the percentage of plagioclase (albite) is greater and that of microcline is lesser than in the other types. The four types of pegmatites constitute an essentially continuous series, their charac-teristics reflecting the course of a single broad genetic process. Their formation is described in terms of the evolution of paragenetic associations that retain their identity throughout all or a great part of this process.

40|$|The Cuprite mining {{district}} in southwestern Nevada {{has become a}} test site for remote sensing studies with numerous airborne scanners and ground sensor data sets collected over the past fifteen years. Structurally, the Cuprite region {{can be divided into}} two areas with slightly different alteration and mineralogy. These zones lie on either side of a postulated low-angle structural discontinuity that strikes nearly parallel to US Route 95. Hydrothermal alternation at Cuprite was classified into three major zones: silicified, opalized, and argillized. These alteration types form a bulls-eye pattern east of the highway and are more linear {{on the west side of}} the highway making a striking contrast from the air and the imagery. Cuprite is therefore an ideal location for remote sensing research as it exhibits easily identified hydrothermal zoning, is relatively devoid of vegetation, and contains a distinctive spectrally diagnostic mineral suite including the ammonium <b>feldspar</b> buddingtonite, several <b>types</b> of alunite, different jarosites, illite, kaolinite, smectite, dickite, and opal. This present study brings a new dimension to these previous remote sensing and ground data sets compiled for Cuprite.

40|$|A {{recently}} designed droplet freezing assay {{was used}} to study the freezing of up to 1500 identical 0. 2  nL water droplets containing suspensions of one Na/Ca-rich feldspar and three K-rich and one Na/Ca-rich <b>feldspar</b> particles. Three <b>types</b> of experiments have been conducted: cooling ramp, isothermal freezing at a constant temperature, and freeze–thaw cycles. The observed freezing behavior has been interpreted {{with the help of}} a model based on the classical nucleation theory (soccer ball model (SBM); Niedermeier et al., 2015). By applying the model to the different freezing experiments conducted with the same ice-nucleating material, the unique sets of model parameters for specific feldspar suspensions could be derived. The SBM was shown to adequately describe the observed cooling rate dependence, the ice-nucleating active sites (INAS) surface density n s (T) in a wide temperature range, and the shift of the freezing curves towards lower temperature with dilution. Moreover, the SBM was capable of reproducing the variation of INAS surface density n s (T) with concentration of ice-nucleating particles in the suspension droplets and correctly predicting the leveling-off of n s (T) at low temperature. The freeze–thaw experiments have clearly shown that the heterogeneous freezing induced even by very active ice-nucleating species still possesses a stochastic nature, with the degree of randomness increasing towards homogeneous nucleation. A population of the high-temperature INAS has been identified in one of the K-rich feldspar samples. The freezing of 0. 8  wt % suspension droplets of this particular feldspar was observed already at − 5  °C. These high-temperature active sites could be deactivated by treating the sample with hydrogen peroxide but survived heating up to 90  °C. Given a high mass concentration of these high-temperature active sites (2. 9 [*]×[*] 10 8  g − 1) and a very low value of contact angle (0. 56  rad) the possibility of biological contamination of the sample was concluded to be unlikely but could not be completely ruled out. The freezing efficacy of all feldspar samples has been shown to reduce only slightly after suspension in water for over 5  months...|$|R

Four diagenetic periods have been delineated, early, burial, maximum burial, and recent. Basinal variations in pore water chemistry, and thermal history results in different authigenic assemblages to the north and south of the basin. Based on authigenic clay type and abundance, three clay zones exist within the basin. Zone I-the smectite/kaolinite zone; Zone 2 -the kaolinite/iHite-smectite zone; and Zone 3 -the illite-smectite zone. These zones correlate to changes in cumulative hydrocarbon production, <b>feldspar</b> content, porosity <b>types</b> and porosity and permeability. These lateral variations correlate to three petrophysical rock types in the Pictured Cliffs Formation. Capillary pressure determines the producibility of a formation. In the Pictured Cliffs the synthetic capillary pressure characteristics of the three petrophysical rock types are a result of the diagenetic assemblages specific to each zone. Petrophysical rock type 1 appears to be the best reservoir, but in fact is water saturated, forming a relative permeability barrier to gas migration updip to the south. Petrophysical rock type 2 coincides with the zone of maximum hydrocarbon production. This is the best reservoir in the Pictured Cliffs sandstones. Petrophysical rock type 3 forms a "diagenetic seal" {{to the north of the}} basin. Production "hot spots" may exists in zone 3, in sandstones with higher percentages of feldspars and rock fragments relative to quartz, since they have a greater potential for preserving secondary porosity generated by carbonate dissolution. Log analysis revealed that the Waxman-Smits shaly sand calculation yielded the highest hydrocarbon saturations. A lab derived cementation exponent (m = 1. 6) used in the Archie equation in sands with < 9 % authigenic clay gave similar saturations to those of the Waxman-Smit method. The Dual Water and Fertl (1975) methods gave similar, but less optimistic hydrocarbon saturations. Clay volume (Vcl) determined from the gamma ray and from x-ray diffraction (xrd), yielded very similar water saturations. However if core porosity and Vcl from xrd were used in the equations, water saturations were much lower...|$|R

To better serve this market industries are concerned to improve products with environmental responsibility, and reduce the cost in the production steps. Stages that are divided in the preparation of raw materials, extrusion, drying and firing. The drying step is distinguished by being very important for the process, since the product quality is directly related to this step. Thus, this work aims to analyze the influence of the type of drying and its variables, such as temperature, time and ventilation conditions, the efficiency of drying ceramic blocks, aiming to propose a method and more efficient drying condition and low cost operating for red ceramic industry.

40|$|Systems and {{components}} of selected Apollo A 7 L/A 7 LB flight-article spacesuits that were worn on {{the lunar surface}} have been studied to determine {{the degree to which}} they suffered contamination, abrasion and wear or loss of function due to effects from lunar soil particles. Filter materials from the lithium hydroxide (LiOH) canisters from the Apollo Command Module were also studied to determine the amount and type of any lunar dust particles they may have captured from the spacecraft atmosphere. The specific spacesuit study materials include the outermost soft fabric layers on Apollo 12 and 17 integrated thermal micrometeorite garment assemblies and outermost fabrics on Apollo 17 extravehicular pressure gloves. In addition, the degree of surface wear in the sealed wrist rotation bearing from Apollo 16 extravehicular and intravehicular pressure gloves was evaluated and compared. Scanning electron microscope examination of the Apollo 12 T- 164 woven TeflonO fabric confirms the presence of lunar soil particles and the ability of these particles to cause separation and fraying of the Teflon fibers. Optical imaging, chemical analysis and particle sampling applied to the outer fabric of the Apollo 17 spacesuit has identified Ti as a potentially useful chemical marker for comparing the amount of lunar soil retained on different areas of the spacesuit outer fabric. High-yield particle sampling from the Apollo 17 fabric surfaces using adhesive tape found 80 % of particles on the fabric are lunar soil particles averaging 10. 5 m in diameter, with the rest being intrinsic fabric materials or environmental contaminants. Analysis of the mineralogical composition of the lunar particles found that on a grain-count basis the particle population is dominated by plagioclase <b>feldspar</b> and various <b>types</b> of glassy particles derived mostly from soil agglutinates, with a subordinate amount of pyroxene. On a grain size basis, however, the pyroxene grains are generally a factor of 2 larger than glass and plagioclase, so conversion of the data to a modal (volume %) basis results in pyroxene becoming the modally dominant particle type with glass and plagioclase significantly less abundant. When comparisons are made to the modal composition of lunar soil at the Apollo 17 landing site, the results suggest that pyroxene particles have overall better retention on the spacesuit outer fabric compared to plagioclase and especially glass. Scanning electron microscopy revealed no measureable difference in the amount of wear and abrasion in the wrist rotation bearing of an Apollo 16 pressure glove worn only in the spacecraft and one worn only for extravehicular activity on the lunar surface. The results suggest either that the bearing prevented entry of lunar dust, or that dust was not sufficiently abrasive to damage the bearing, or both...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 91 - 104) The {{purpose of}} this study was to create a model for interpreting the provenance of offshore, petroleum-bearing sandstone reservoirs in the Taranaki Basin of New Zealand using sand samples from modern streams in the region as proxies. Twenty sand samples from streams draining plutonic, metamorphic, and sedimentary terranes exposed on South Island, New Zealand, were collected for petrographic analysis. Sand samples were air-dried, sieved into five sand fractions from very fine to very coarse, made into thin sections, and stained for recognition of potassium- and calcium-bearing feldspar. Using a microscope equipped with an automated point-counting stepper stage, 400 grains per sample were point counted and separated into 102 monomineralic and lithic fragment grain categories. Recalculated parameters were plotted on various ternary diagrams and analyzed for trends in composition with grain size and terrane. Overall, sand derived from erosion of the Median Batholith tends to have less quartz than sand from the Karamea Batholith and a higher monomineralic percentage of plagioclase, while sand from the Karamea Batholith has a higher proportion of monomineralic potassium feldspar. Sand derived from erosion of the Buller Terrane is the most quartz-rich of the non-plutonic terrane samples. Feldspar is rare in all the Eastern province terranes (Caples, Torlesse, and Dun Mountain-Maitai and Brook Street). Sand from the Dun Mountain-Maitai and Brook Street terranes has the lowest quartz content and is recognizable by distinctive serpentine pseudomorphs replacing mafic minerals. Pervasive pumpellyite is characteristic of metamorphic lithic fragments derived from some Eastern Province terranes, particularly the Caples along with the Dun Mountain-Maitai and Brook Street, exposed to prehnite-pumpellyite metamorphism along the boundary between the Australian and Pacific plates. Marlborough Schist-, Caples- and Torlesse Terrane-derived sands are recognizable on the basis of relatively high monomineralic quartz plus epidote and clinozoisite/zoisite together with either pumpellyite or albite and almost no potassium feldspar. Older Taranaki Basin sandstones, such as the Cretaceous North Cape Formation, appear to be derived from plutonic sources such as the Karamea and Median batholiths; a more detailed comparison of specific feldspar components in offshore wells would help distinguish between the two. Sandstones that are more lithic-rich in some wells and more quartz-rich in others, such as the Late Cretaceous Rakopi Formation, may be derived from the same plutonic sources with input from metasedimentary/-metavolcanic sources such as the Buller and Takaka terranes. Based on quartz, feldspar, and lithic fragment proportions, the Miocene Moki and Mount Messenger formations appear to be derived from the Marlborough Schist (Caples Terrane and Rakaia subterrane of the Torlesse Terrane), with some input from plutonic sources. More detailed analysis of <b>feldspar</b> and lithic <b>types</b> is needed to better fingerprint specific sand sources in these and younger Tertiary reservoir sandstones, especially as the latter may have been partly derived from arc magmatic rocks. This project provides an empirical dataset for continued comparison and analysis of offshore petroleum-bearing deposits and their source on the South Island of New Zealand, and a benchmark of modern sand petrography against which the petrography of older sandstones within the basin can be compared...|$|R
