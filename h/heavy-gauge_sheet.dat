50|$|The {{slide of}} the P220 series is a <b>heavy-gauge</b> <b>sheet</b> metal {{stamping}} with a welded-on nose section incorporating an internal barrel bushing. The breech block portion is a machined insert {{attached to the}} slide {{by means of a}} roll pin visible from either side. The frame is of forged alloy with a hard-anodized coating. The SIG P220 series incorporates a hammer-drop lever {{to the rear of the}} trigger on the left side, which first appeared on the Sauer 38H before World War I. After chambering a round, the hammer will be cocked, so for safe carriage the hammer drop is actuated with the thumb, dropping the hammer in a safe manner.|$|E
5000|$|The Armalite AR-16 {{appeared}} in the later 1950s. The AR-16, a 7.62mm NATO selective-fire rifle, was Eugene Stoner's final design for ArmaLite. The AR-16 and its predecessor, the AR-12 were designed by Stoner in response to demands by the military forces of smaller, less developed nations for a less expensive, yet state-of-the-art selective-fire military rifle that unlike the AR-10 and AR-15, could be produced inexpensively of <b>heavy-gauge</b> <b>sheet</b> metal using automatic screw machines, lathes, and presses. The AR-12 originally featured a direct-impingement (DI) gas operation system, but this was changed to a more conventional short-stroke gas piston in the AR-16 after ArmaLite sold the production rights to the DI system to Colt Firearms. The AR-16 had a short, 15-inch barrel, hinged wooden butt, and weighed 8.75 pounds empty; only three examples were built. [...] Eugene Stoner left ArmaLite in 1961, shortly before Fairchild divested itself of ownership.|$|E
5000|$|The Marine Multi-purpose Vehicle {{is built}} around a tubular-steel frame safety roll-cage which protects the {{passenger}} compartment if the vehicle turns over. This cage is covered by a <b>heavy-gauge</b> <b>sheet</b> metal. An electrical winch with a capacity of 5000 kg can be mounted {{at the front of}} the vehicle if required, and the windshield can be removed. The passenger compartment is in the center of the vehicle with the driver on the left and two passenger seats to his right. There is space for [...] of cargo behind the passenger seats. A full length skid pan protects the hull and allows the vehicle to slide over obstacles. The transmission is a Mitsubishi A-727 fully automatic with a torque converter, there are 3F and 1R gears - the Marine Multi-purpose Vehicle is in 4 x 4 drive all the time. Limited-slip clutches, in front and rear, and inter-axle differentials automatically distribute more torque to those wheels with the most grip. The independent suspension is of a double 'A' design with a torsion-bar spring and hydraulic telescopic shock absorber at each station. A stabilizer bar is provided for the rear suspension.|$|E
50|$|Three key {{interventions}} {{were discussed}} and disseminated; ventilation by enlarging windows or opening eaves spaces, adding smoke hoods over the cooking area, or {{the option of}} installing an improved cook stove such as the Upesi stove. Smoke hoods are free-standing units that act like flues or chimneys {{in their effort to}} draw smoke out of the dwelling. They can be used over traditional open fires and this study showed they contribute to considerably lower levels of IAP. The smoke hood models were made with hard manila paper and then transferred to <b>heavy-gauge</b> galvanized <b>sheet</b> metal and manufactured locally. This resulted in further employment opportunities for the artisans who were trained by the project. The Upesi stove, made of clay and kiln-fired, was developed by Practical Action and East African partners to utilize wood and agricultural wastes. Because this stove was designed and adapted for local needs it produced several winning features. Not only does it cut the use of fuel-wood by approximately half, and reduce exposure to household smoke, it also empowers local women by creating employment as {{they are the ones who}} make and market the stoves. These women's groups gain access to technical training in production and marketing and enjoy higher wage earnings and improved social status as a result of the introduction of this improved stove.|$|R
5000|$|TheXR311 {{is built}} around a tubular-steel frame safety roll-cage which protects the {{passenger}} compartment if the vehicle rolls over. This cage is covered by a <b>heavy-gauge</b> <b>sheet</b> metal forming {{the skin of the}} vehicle.An internally mounted electrical extraction winch with a capacity of 5000 kgcan be mounted {{at the front of the}} vehicle if required, and the 2-piecewindshield can be removed to provide greater visibility and protect from flying glass fragments. The glass halves are stored in a mounting bracket on the hood until needed again. The passenger compartment is in the center of the vehicle with the driver on the left and the passenger seat to the right. There is space for [...] of cargo behind the passenger seats. The engine and transmission are at the rear of the hull and there is an external load-carrying platform above this which can take a maximum load of 386 kg. The minimum ground clearance is 11 inches, and a full length skid pan protects the hull and drivetrain, which allows the vehicle to slide over obstacles. The transmission is a Chrysler A-727 [...] "TorqueFlite" [...] torque converter automatic, with three forward and one reverse gears. The XR311 is a full-time 4WD vehicle. [...] "Trak-lok" [...] limited-slip differentials with a 5.89:1 drive ratio are used front and rear, and a lockable center differential ensures traction to all wheels. The fully independent suspension uses modified Dana 44 centersections, and used many off the shelf parts from the front wheel drive Oldsmobile Toronado / Cadillac Eldorado (e.g., CV joints and boots, spindle and bearings, and 11 inch disk brakes), and is of a double-wishbone design with a torsion-bar spring and hydraulic telescopic shock absorber at each station. A stabilizer baris provided for the rear suspension to limit body roll. Maximum speed is 80-90 mph for vehicles with the 318ci engine, dropping to 67 mph at full load. Acceleration was 12 seconds 0-60 mph time, falling to 10 seconds with the 360ci engine.|$|E
