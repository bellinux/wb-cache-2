40|$|Spotted {{knapweed}} (Centaurea stoebe), {{a common}} invasive {{plant in the}} Pacific Northwest, produces the racemic chemical ±-Catechin. Current research suggests that ±-Catechin inhibits root growth in Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis), a common native bunch grass. These findings suggest that competition between these two species results in a negative fitness and diminished ecological success of Idaho fescue. This phenomenon of one species’ chemical exudate affecting another species’ fitness is known as allelopathy. Current allelopathic research is conducted in the dark to highlight any differential growth between control and experimental groups due to the over-expression of gibberellin hormones resulting in etiolation. It is difficult to simulate environmental conditions completely, and it is unknown if energy input through photosynthesis would affect ±-Catechin’s inhibition of Idaho fescue root elongation. Therefore, we will investigate if ±-Catechin’s allelopathic effects are mitigated by the input of energy by replicating previous ±-Catechin research under similar conditions and using light as the experimental variable. Using germination paper, three replicates of 120 Idaho <b>fescue</b> <b>seeds</b> that will be placed into rows and grown in solutions of (±) -Catechin at concentrations of 20 ppm. After two weeks, root length will be analyzed for significant differences between these experiments in the light and previous experiments conducted in the dark. Results of this research will be invaluable in understanding the ecological interactions of spotted knapweed on native plants and help current research more accurately replicate environmental conditions in a laboratory setting...|$|E
40|$|Invasive plants {{decrease}} native plant {{diversity and}} alter ecosystem structure and function, and controlling their spread represents a significant cost to taxpayers. Most exotic species are not invasive {{in their native}} range, so successful invasive management requires understanding the biological mechanisms that allow exotic plants to gain advantage over native plants and become invasive. The Novel Weapons Hypothesis postulates that exotic plant exudates, compounds released from plant roots, have an allelopathic effect on native plants that reduces their fitness and decreases their ecological success. The allelopathic compounds could thus allow an exotic plant to become a superior competitor over native species and reach invasive status. Spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe), an introduced European annual, produces the racemic chemical (±) -catechin, which has allelopathic qualities on the native grass Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis), although {{the severity of the}} allelopathy is contentious and uncertain. Much research has focused on extreme (±) -catechin concentrations unlikely to be found in nature, but instead, we tested the dose-dependent effects of environmentally relevant (±) -catechin concentrations on root growth of Idaho fescue. Using germination paper, three replicates of 120 Idaho <b>fescue</b> <b>seeds</b> were placed into rows and grown in (±) -catechin solution concentrations of 20 ppm and 80 ppm. Catechin was found to significantly inhibit root growth in both concentrations compared to control solutions of water, t test, p 3 ̆c 0. 05. This finding supports the Novel Weapons Hypothesis by offering evidence of spotted knapweed’s allelopathic nature at environmentally relevant (±) -catechin concentrations, and it offers insight into proactive invasive plant management...|$|E
40|$|Efficient {{germination}} of <b>fescue</b> <b>seeds</b> {{is essential}} for successful establishment of meadows and pastures. This research was conducted to ascertain the effects of various acid and temperature treatments on seed germination in three fescue species: Festuca rubra, F. ovina, and F.  pratensis. Seeds from different cultivars, populations, or lots were exposed either to four concentrations of sulfuric acid at three different time intervals (12 treatments) or six different temperatures at three different time intervals (18 treatments). Despite all belonging to the genus Festuca, the seed from different species responded differently to the treatments. The three optimum treatments for F. rubra seed involved soaking in a 75 % solution of sulfuric acid for 20 minutes (improved the germination rate by 19 %), soaking in a 50 % solution of sulfuric acid for 30 minutes (improved the germination rate by 18 %) and exposure to either 60 °C or 70 °C for 90 minutes (improved the germination rate by 17 %). For F. ovina seed, optimal treatments included soaking seeds for either 10 or 20 minutes in a 50 % sulfuric acid solution (both treatments improved germination rates by 13 %) or exposing seeds for 30 minutes in a 25 % sulfuric acid solution and  80 °C for 60 minutes (improved germination rate by 12 %). Two optimal treatments were identified for F. pratensis seed. Whereas the first involved soaking the seeds in a 75 % sulfuric acid solution for 30 minutes (improved germination rates by 22 %), the second involved either exposing the seeds to 90 °C for 90 or 60 minutes, or exposing the seeds to 80 °C for 90 minutes (improved germination rate by 21 %).  Our findings indicate that if fescue seed is to be sown during the autumn (two to three months after seed collecting), treating it with acid and temperature can significantly enhance its germination...|$|E

40|$|Ergot {{alkaloids}} in endophyte-infected grasses inhibit prolactin (PRL) secretion and {{may reduce}} milk production of cows consuming these grasses. We investigated {{the effects of}} consuming endophyte-infected <b>fescue</b> <b>seed</b> during late lactation and the dry period on mammary growth, differentiation, and milk production. Twenty-four multiparous Holstein cows {{were randomly assigned to}} 3 treatment groups. Starting at 90 ± 4 d prepartum, cows were fed endophyte-free <b>fescue</b> <b>seed</b> (control; CON), endophyte-free <b>fescue</b> <b>seed</b> plus 3 ×/wk subcutaneous injections of bromocriptine (0. 1 mg/kg of body weight, positive control; BROMO), or endophyte-infected <b>fescue</b> <b>seed</b> (INF) as 10 % of the diet on an as fed basis. Although milk yield of groups did not differ before treatment, at dry off (- 60 d prepartum) INF and BROMO cows produced less milk than CON. Throughout the treatment period, basal concentrations of PRL and the prepartum increase in plasma PRL were reduced in INF and BROMO cows compared with CON cows. Three weeks after the end of treatment, circulating concentrations of PRL were equivalent across groups. In the subsequent lactation milk yield was not decreased; in fact, BROMO cows exhibited a 9 % increase in milk yield relative to CON. Evaluation of mammary tissue during the dry period and the subsequent lactation, by quantitative histology and immunohistochemical analysis of proliferation markers and putative mammary stem or progenitor cell markers, indicated that feeding endophyte-infected <b>fescue</b> <b>seed</b> did not significantly affect mammary growth and development.

40|$|Many Poaceae grasses form a {{symbiosis}} with Epichloë fungal endophytes. Initially {{a serious}} problem in agriculture due to their production of alkaloids toxic to livestock, endophyte strains were identified that were less toxic to livestock whilst also possessing advantageous traits, including insect deterrent alkaloids. Selection and transfer of these endophytes into elite grass cultivars has resulted in pastures with improved persistence with no, or reduced, livestock toxicosis. These novel associations are now successfully marketed in New Zealand (NZ), Australia, USA and South America. Epichloë species exhibit strong host specificity and the asexual form is exclusively vertically transmitted through maternal lines via the seed embryo. In New Zealand, the dominant commercially available agricultural associations are between perennial ryegrass and E. festucae var. lolii strains that rely on the production of peramine, epoxy-janthitrems and ergovaline for their insect deterrent properties. However, AgResearch Ltd. and PGG Wrightson Seeds Ltd. have developed a novel association between a tall-fescue-derived endophyte (designated strain AR 501) and a perennial ryegrass host. This brings {{a new set of}} secondary metabolites to the New Zealand agriculture scenario based on perennial ryegrass pastures, namely the loline alkaloids. An association formed between this fungus and perennial ryegrass would provide the grass sward excellent protection against ASW and grass grub, without creating any animal health problems. However, this process is far from perfect because of endophyte transmission failures. Possible reason for these failures include endophyte and host genotype incompatibility, environmental factors and crop management regimes. This study was an investigation of two of the factors that may affect the vertical transmission of AR 501 and the maintenance of endophyte viability in stored seeds. A controlled environment was used to determine the influence of temperature on endophyte transmission frequency, on fungal biomass and on concentrations of loline alkaloids, in tall fescue and perennial ryegrass. Seedlings of both associations were arranged in a controlled environment at four temperature regimes ranging from 6 - 25 °C. After three and six weeks, endophyte transmission frequencies and endophyte biomass were quantified. After three weeks plants from both associations were transferred from a 12 / 6 °C to a 25 / 16 °C environment and their endophyte biomass re-calculated. For perennial ryegrass, the endophyte transmission frequency was significantly higher in plants kept at a cold (day/night 12 / 6 °C) temperature regime compared to the warm (day/night 25 / 16 °C) regime. This was not observed in tall fescue. The endophyte biomass concentrations of both associations increased when after three weeks plants were transferred from the cold to warm temperature regime. To better understand how the endophyte and its host behaved under different temperature regimes, the cardinal temperature for AR 501 and the host was determined. The cardinal temperatures for AR 501 were higher in perennial ryegrass (Tb of - 1. 82 °C, Topt of 25. 26 °C and Tm of 54. 94 °C) than in tall fescue (Tb of - 0. 04 °C, Topt of 15. 90 °C and Tm of 29. 04 °C). Cardinal temperatures were also higher for perennial ryegrass than for tall fescue. However the induction of thermodormancy in tall <b>fescue</b> <b>seeds</b> interfered with the calculation of cardinal temperatures for the endophyte and tall fescue host, and it is probable that the optimal temperature for AR 501 in the tall fescue host may be higher than determined in this study. Storage factors such as temperature, seed moisture content and length of storage can affect the viability of both seed and endophyte. Seeds of both associations were stored for 12 months under four storage temperature regimes (5 °C, 10 °C, 20 °C and 30 °C) and at two seed moisture contents (10 % and 14 %) to investigate whether temperature and/or seed moisture content would affect endophyte viability in stored seeds. In both associations, endophyte in seeds stored at 30 °C and 14 % SMC had died after 12 months of storage, but in seeds stored in moisture proof packaging at lower temperature (5 or 10 °C), endophyte viability was maintained throughout the 12 months. In addition, the thermal time model was used to predict time for AR 501 viability in the stored seeds. The prediction was that AR 501 viability would remain above 70 % for 13 months longer in tall <b>fescue</b> <b>seeds</b> than in perennial ryegrass seeds if they were stored at low temperature (≤ 10 °C) and at 10 % SMC. The effect of seed crop management factors, such as nitrogen (N) fertiliser, fungicide and plant growth regulator application on AR 501 infection frequency in perennial ryegrass and Italian ryegrass was also investigated. None of the three seed production management factors affected the transmission of AR 501 from plant to seed in perennial ryegrass, but did so in Italian ryegrass. This requires further investigation...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1980 The {{wetlands}} are {{distinguished from}} other {{lands of the}} Mid-Willamette Valley by excessive soil moisture. The wetlands, as defined for this study, consist of 20 soil series (in 22 soil mapping units) which are classified by the Soil Conservation Service as having excessive wetness as the major factor limiting their uses. The five counties considered in this study, Benton, Linn, Marion, Polk, and Yamhill, have been {{and continue to be}} important to the agricultural production of Oregon. In 1977, this region produced 28. 4 % of the state's value of sales from agricultural Products. In the same year, this five-county area also produced 100 % of the nation's ryegrass, crimson clover, and red <b>fescue</b> <b>seeds,</b> and large quantities of other important seeds. Personal interviews were conducted with 141 wetland farmers during the period January through March, 1979. The land farmed by the interviewed farmers amounted to 63, 748 acres, which represented 9. 8 % of the 652, 000 acres of wetlands in the Mid-Willamette Valley. Farmer responses obtained from the interviews provided the data base for much of this study. Information Pertaining to farm types and crops were cross tabulated with other variables using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences at Oregon State University. The resulting statistics were evaluated for patterns of distributions and emerging trends in agricultural land uses. Of the surveyed farmers, 73 % were full-time operators; the remainder were part-time, semi-retired, or hobby farmers. There were wide variability in farm sizes, 15 to 5, 400 acres for full-time farmers, and 5 to 424 acres for part-time farmers. Farms producing grass seeds, row crops, and grain were generally large in size, while farms producing tree fruits, nuts, berries, nursery products, and other specialty crops were generally small. Although the Mid-Willamette Valley wetlands form a valuable part of Oregon's agricultural land base, the production capacity of much of the wetlands can be further upgraded by installation of drainage and irrigation systems. However, the current high costs for these resource converting systems, and the elimination of Federal cost-sharing for farm drainage projects, may make installation of these systems economically infeasible for many farmers. In early 1979, costs for installation of new drainage systems were $ 300 to $ 400 per acre. Irrigation systems cost $ 225 to $ 450 per acre, with the actual cost {{depending on the type of}} irrigation system selected. Farmers' perceptions of factors considered to have adverse effects on their farming operations were examined for two periods: the past five years, 1974 through 1978, and the current agricultural year, 1979. For the five-year period, 64 % of the farmers stated that they had experienced what they considered to be serious problems. The two primary groups of problems were those related to reduction of the farmers' net income and farm production. The third group of problems pertained to policy limitations, particularly the acreage limitations to open field burning, and government regulations, restrictions, and interference. During the period 1977 to 1978, 10. 6 % of the interviewed farmers had made land use changes. The 15 farmers made 19 changes involving 773 acres. There were large net gains in acreage for legumes, and smaller net gains for row crops, peppermint, and strawberries. The largest net acreage loss was for grain. Smaller net losses occurred for grass seed and silage. Farmers who had made land use changes rated 12 of the 19 changes as satisfactory, 3 as unsatisfactory, and 4 as not possible to evaluate until crop is harvested. Most of the wetlands are currently limited to the production of grass seed due to the severe physical limitations. Therefore, open field burning will continue to be an important issue on Oregon's Mid-Willamette Valley wetlands...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1978 This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to obtain information}} {{on the quality of}} grass seed when windrowed at the high moisture levels necessary for obtaining maximum yields. A secondary goal was to monitor moisture and temperature fluctuations in the windrow and to relate their effects to development and deterioration of the seed. Three species of perennial grasses were included in the study: tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) variety "Fawn", orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) variety "Potomac", and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) variety "Linn". The effect of heading date on seed development at the recommended windrowing time was evaluated with individually tagged panicles. Tall fescue was windrowed on 28 June, 01 July and 06 July; orchardgrass on 28 June, 01 July and 06 July; and perennial ryegrass on 01 July, 06 July and 16 July. These dates were chosen to provide windrows mowed at moisture levels higher than, equal to, and lower than the optimum for maximum yields of pure live seed. Moisture and temperature fluctuations in the windrow were monitored and changes in seed development and deterioration were evaluated. Heading date influenced several seed quality characteristics at the recommended time for windrowing. Early inflorescences were lowest in seed moisture content. Tall fescue and perennial ryegrass seeds from the Late group, and orchardgrass seeds from the Intermediate and Late groups had not attained maximum seed weight. Seedlings of tall fescue and orchardgrass produced by seeds from the Late group had not attained maximum shoot weight. Seeds of all inflorescence age groups reached maximum viability several days before optimum windrowing date. Seed moisture contents when windrowed were 51. 6, 41. 5, and 15. 9 % in tall fescue, 44. 8, 41. 4 and 30. 7 % in orchardgrass, and 49. 8, 28. 5 and 19. 1 % in perennial ryegrass. During periods without rainfall, seed moisture decreased rapidly during the day, increased during the night, and decreased to a new low the following day. Several rains occurred during this period, raising seed moisture levels above 40 %. During the drying period, seed moisture in {{the lower part of the}} perrenial ryegrass windrow was as much as 8 % higher than seed in the upper part. The average maximum temperatures in the upper and lower portions of the perennial ryegrass windrow were 38. 3 and 24. 3 °C during July and 31. 1 and 19. 2 ⁰C during August. The maximum temperature reached in the upper part was 47 °C on 28 and 29 July. Each weeks' delay in windrowing resulted in improved seed quality, with the greatest improvement occurring between the first and second cutting, However, the data support Klein and Harmond's recommendations for windrowing tall fescue at 43 % moisture, orchardgrass at 44 % moisture, and perennial ryegrass at 35 % moisture. Perennial ryegrass seed quality was not improved by delaying windrowing, while orchardgrass and tall <b>fescue</b> <b>seeds</b> increased somewhat in weight. Because of the risk of increased shattering losses, delaying windrowing to improve seed quality does not appear justified. A small amount of seed development took place while the seeds were in the windrow. Seed weight of tall fescue harvested at 51. 6 % moisture increased from 250. 6 to 279. 6 mg/ 100 seeds. No increase in seed weight occurred in the other species or windrowing dates. After several days in the windrow, speed of germination increased in all three species. Germination percentage, seedling emergence, and shoot weight did not improve after windrowing. Very little seed deterioration occurred during the first month in the windrow. A perceptible drop in germination of orchardgrass and perennial ryegrass occurred during the 2 weeks prior to the 19 August sampling date. Seed weight declined by the end of the experimental period in all three crops. Some germinated seeds were found in the perennial ryegras windrows by the end of August. No reduction in speed of germination or shoot weight occurred, while there was a trend toward reduced seedling emergence near the end of the experimental period. There were no indications that the stage of maturity when harvested influenced the rate of seed deterioration in the windrow. The probability of seed deterioration occurring at a faster rate than in 1976 is not great since a total of 75. 69 mm (2. 98 in) of rain fell during the experimental period, compared to a normal rainfall of 27. 43 mm (1. 08 in) ...|$|E

Measures of dependent variables were collected on d 20, 25, 29 and 35 of each period at 0730 (before feeding), 1230 and 1530. In Expt 1 steers weighed 286 kg, gained 0. 61 kg BW/d, E+ supplied 2. 72 mg ergot alkaloids including 1. 60 mg ergovaline per steer daily, and mean minimum and maximum daily ambient temperatures were 23. 6 and 32. 3 °C. In Expt 2 steers weighed 348 kg, gained 1. 03 kg BW/d, E+ supplied 3. 06 mg ergot alkaloids including 2. 00 mg ergovaline daily, and mean minimum and maximum daily ambient temperatures were 11. 9 and 17. 4 °C. Dry matter intake was not affected by <b>fescue</b> <b>seed</b> treatment (P < 0. 20) in either experiment. In both experiments, E+ reduced HR (P < 0. 01) and increased insulin (P = 0. 07). Systolic BP minus diastolic BP decreased (P< 0. 05) for E+ in both experiments, due to increased diastolic BP in Expt 1 (P < 0. 03) and decreased systolic BP in Expt 2 (P < 0. 07).

Spring cereals reduced the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) available for grass seedling growth, causing transient increases in chlorophyll content and lower soil temperatures. Soil water content was also depleted, causing increased stomatal resistance and lower transpiration rate. Reductions in PPFD and soil water were responsible for poor stand establishment and grass crop growth.

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 Legislation {{to reduce}} open field burning in grass seed fields within the Willamette valley of western Oregon changed {{established}} production practices. In the creeping grasses such as Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) and {{creeping red fescue}} (Festuca rubra L.) non-thermal management resulted in reduced yield. Studies were conducted {{to examine the effects}} of three stubble height treatments in comparison to open field burning in creeping red <b>fescue</b> <b>seed</b> production. The effects of light quality on characteristics of plant development were investigated in field and controlled environments. Exogenous applications of plant growth regulators (PGR's) were made to elucidate the causes of low seed yields observed without burning. Field plots were prepared in fall of 1994, and 1995 in creeping red fescue commercial production fields as well as at Hyslop research farm in 1995. Three cultivars were included in the trial; Shademaster and Hector, which produce many rhizomes, and Seabreeze which produces few rhizomes. The effects of stubble height, PGRs, and field burning were measured during fall regrowth and flowering. Non-structural carbohydrates available for early regrowth were reduced when stubble was removed below 5. 0 cm, particularly in first-year stands. Fall tiller height was increased by stubble remaining and was negatively correlated with flowering. Rhizome development was reduced when stubble was removed mechanically or burned to the crown, whereas yield potential was increased. Fall ethylene application reduced fall tiller height, fall tiller number, and percent fertile tillers the following spring and was similar to control treatment compared with burn. Other PGRs did not produce consistent results in this study. Excess ethylene produced by decaying stubble may impact floral induction and reduce yield potential in creeping red <b>fescue</b> <b>seed</b> crops. Light quality as measured by red:far-red ratio (R:FR) was reduced by canopy closure during regrowth but not by the presence of stubble. In controlled environment studies, red light (R) promoted taller tillers, greater stage of development, and greater tiller number than far-red (FR) light. Sunlight enriched with FR completely inhibited rhizome formation. Results suggest that environments with excess reflected FR may negatively impact early development of creeping red <b>fescue</b> <b>seed</b> crops...|$|R

Alley cropping is an agroforestry practice that utilizes the space between rows of trees to produce an alternate crop. Tall fescue demonstrates shade tolerance and may be well suited for the production of certified seed in alley-cropping systems in Missouri. The objective was to evaluate tall <b>fescue</b> <b>seed</b> production in alley cropping. Three management practices associated with grass seed production were also evaluated; row spacing, N fertilization, and post-harvest residue management. In 2004 seed yields in the alley-cropped plots were similar to the open plots; in 2005, all plots had reduced yield and the alley-cropped plots yielded significantly less than the open plots. We attribute the decrease of the second year harvest to poor soil moisture and increased competition from trees. Seed yield was closely related to the number of reproductive culms m- 1 of row; however, there were no differences among treatments for seed weight and seeds culm- 1. This research shows that tall <b>fescue</b> <b>seed</b> yield in an alley-cropping system can be equal to yields from pasture until competition for resources from trees has a negative influence on the crop. A producer who is interested in establishing an orchard should find that certified turf-type tall fescue is a viable crop for an alley-cropping system...|$|R

Modified GLMN was provided at 0 (E+), 5 (E+ 5), or 10 g (E+ 10) twice daily. Efficacy of ergot alkaloid adsorption by GLMN was evaluated by measuring alkaloid consumption vs. fecal and urine excretion. Blood metabolites and hormones were evaluated as physiological indicators of ergot elimination. Hay and total DM intake (DMI) was not affected (p = 0. 59) and ranged from 1. 17 to 1. 33 and 2. 0 to 2. 15 % BW/d, respectively. Ergot alkaloid concentrations in feces (p = 0. 02; 31. 02 to 225. 53 ng g - 1) and urine (p - 1 creatinine) were greater for mares receiving E+, E+ 5, or E+ 10 than E- and supplemental GLMN did not alter urinary ergot alkaloid excretion. No differences were found within treatment phase for plasma 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC; p = 0. 24; 4. 94 to 8. 68 ng mL - 1), serum cortisol (p = 0. 14; 4. 48 to 5. 69 g dL - 1), or PRL (p = 0. 40; 2. 89 to 3. 85 ng mL - 1).

For two interrow spacing used (12, 5 cm with 30 kgha- 1 the sowing amount of seeds, and 25 cm with 15 kgha- 1 sowing amount of seeds), and quantity and time of mineral fertilizer applied (control-without application of mineral fertilizer; N 60 : P 60 : K 60 kgha- 1 applied in the fall, N 90 : P 60 : K 60 kgha- 1 applied in the fall, N 60 : P 60 : K 60 kgha- 1 applied in early spring; N 90 : P 60 : K 60 kgha- 1 applied in early spring), an average seed yield of tall fescue was 579 kgha- 1. The highest yield was achieved using 25 cm of interrow spacing {{and the application of}} N 90 : P 60 : K 60 fertilizer in the early spring (632 kgha- 1). The lowest yield was achieved using 12, 5 cm of interrow spacing and without mineral fertilizer application (381 kgha- 1). In contrast to highly significant impact on tall <b>fescue</b> <b>seed</b> yield examined, interrow spacing and the application of mineral fertilizer did not show significant effect on germination energy and total germinability. Although the impact of interrow spacing on the 1000 seeds mass appeared significant, application of mineral fertilizer did not.

40|$|Ergot {{alkaloids}} {{produced by}} a fungal endophyte (Epichloë coenophiala; formerly Neotyphodium coenphialum) that infects tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum) can induce persistent constriction of the vasculature in ruminants, hindering their capability to thermo-regulate core body temperature. There is evidence that isoflavones produced by legumes can relax the vasculature, which suggests they could relieve ergot alkaloid-induced vasoconstriction and mitigate the vulnerability to severe heat stress in cattle that graze tall fescue. To test if isoflavones can relieve alkaloid-induced vasoconstriction, two pen experiments were conducted with rumen fistulated goats (Capra hircus) to determine with ultrasonograpy if isoflavones can 1) promote vascular compliance by countering alkaloid-induced vasoconstriction, and 2) relieve already imposed alkaloid-induced vasoconstriction. Goats were fed ad libitum chopped orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata) - timothy (Phleum pratense) hay prior to conducting the experiments. Measures of carotid and interosseous luminal areas were obtained pre- (baseline) and post-ruminal infusions in both experiments with goats being fed the hay, and for blood flow rate in the carotid artery in Exp. 2. Responses to infusion treatments were evaluated as proportionate differences from baseline measures. Peak systolic velocity, pulsatility index, and heart rate were measured {{on the last day}} of treatment (DOT) in Exp. 1, and on all imaging sessions during Exp. 2. For Exp. 1, rumens were infused with ground toxic <b>fescue</b> <b>seed</b> and isoflavones in Phase A and with only the toxic seed in Phase B.

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Ingestion of endophyte-infected tall fescue (E+) may result in fescue toxicosis, which is associated with a significant reduction in feed intake. It is possible that the reduction in caloric intake could contribute to some of the symptoms associated with this condition. The following study evaluated this possibility. Time-related changes in core body temperature (Tc), activity, feed intake and body weight were determined in rats fed diets containing either endophyte-infected <b>seed</b> (E+), uninfected <b>fescue</b> <b>seed</b> (E-), or uninfected <b>fescue</b> <b>seed</b> at the level consumed on the previous day by rats fed the E+ diet (PFE+; pair-fed). These diets were fed for seven days at thermoneutrality (i. e., 21 °C), followed by three days of exposure to thermoneutral (TN; 21 °C) or heat stress environments (HS; 31 °C). Cumulative effects of both E+ diet and HS on feed intake and body weight gain were observed. Average daily Tc of E+ and PFE+ rats tended to decrease during the preheat period by reducing the daily minimum Tc, with greater reduction in the PFE+ group. During HS, the average daily Tc of E+ group increased with a shift in diurnal Tc values to a higher level indicative of hyperthermia. In contrast, the daily Tc and circadian rhythm of the PFE+ group was similar to TN groups, suggesting that reduced feed intake might explain the hypothermia experienced during at thermoneutrality, but not the hyperthermia experienced by the E+ group during heat stress. Prolactin levels were decreased in E+ fed rats irrespective of ambient temperature. There was no effect of E+ treatment on serum parameters at TN. During HS, E+ treatment lowered cholesterol and amylase levels relative to E- levels. The PFE+ treatment lowered cholesterol in both environments, and reduced amylase, ALP, and albumin relative to E- treated animals in the HS environment. The above results suggest that decreased feed intake partially contributes to the hypothermia at thermoneutrality in E+ and PFE+ groups, but only explains some of the E+ effects during short-term heat stress...|$|R

40|$|Meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.) {{is grown}} widely in the Nordic {{countries}} in forage grass mixtures. Locally adapted cultivars are preferred for establishment of mixed swards. Meadow <b>fescue</b> <b>seed</b> yield {{is determined by}} seed weight, the number of panicle bearing tillers, size of panicles {{and the number of}} fertile florets. We aimed to determine the differences in components of seed yield in two different meadow fescue cultivars differing in forage quality; Kalevi, released in 1979, and Fure, released in 1999. Biomass accumulation was monitored, numbers of fertile and sterile florets, and seeds were counted, and the forage quality was analysed. Seed quality was also analysed. Fure was leafier and accumulated more vegetative biomass than Kalevi. Kalevi had significantly more panicles than Fure, although Fure compensated for the lower number of panicles with increased panicle size. There were no differences in number of sterile and aborted florets between cultivars. Based on the results it seems that these two meadow fescue cultivars have a completely different strategy in seed production even though the final seed yield was not markedly different. It is apparent that meadow fescues have good ability to compensate among the components of seed yield. Long-term field experiments should be conducted to investigate the interactions between plant stand ecology, seed production and cultivation technology. ...|$|R

This study was done to investigate the effects of heat stress combined with infected tall <b>fescue</b> <b>seed</b> and associated decreased feed intake on male reproduction. Twelve male rats were implanted with telemetric thermometers (Mini-Mitter, Inc.) to record core body temperature and activity every ten minutes.

Moreover, more {{studies are needed to}} determine which species will be benefitted or unaffected by the availability of roadside habitat. Bird censuses, nest searches and small mammal sampling were conducted along Illinois Route 5 (111 - 5) ROW’S in northwestern Illinois (Whiteside County). Only 9 species of birds were recorded within the 111 - 5 ROW’S during my 2 -year study. Of these, only 1 bird, the Red-winged Blackbird, was abundant. Six bird species nested in the ROW. The Red-winged Blackbird, however, made 92. 9 % of all bird nests. Thus, the 111 - 5 ROW in northwestern Illinois was not used by a wide array of birds for foraging or nesting. Small mammals, on the other hand, found these areas attractive. Shrub plantings increased the numerical abundance of birds (primarily Red-winged Blackbirds) using ROW’S, but they did not increase bird species richness.
