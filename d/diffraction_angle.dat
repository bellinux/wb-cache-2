50|$|A {{simple method}} of {{modulating}} the optical beam travelling through the acousto-optic device {{is done by}} switching the acoustic field on and off. When off the light beam is undiverted, the intensity of light directed at the Bragg <b>diffraction</b> <b>angle</b> is zero. When switched on and Bragg diffraction occurs, the intensity at the Bragg angle increases. So the acousto-optic device is modulating the output along the Bragg <b>diffraction</b> <b>angle,</b> switching it on and off. The device is operated as a modulator by keeping the acoustic wavelength (frequency) fixed and varying the drive power to vary the amount {{of light in the}} deflected beam.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{developed}} {{a method to}} make GEM foils with a spherical geometry. Tests of this procedure and with the resulting spherical GEMs are presented. Together with a spherical drift electrode, a spherical conversion gap for x-rays can be formed. This would eliminate the parallax error in an x-ray diffraction setup, which limits the spatial resolution at wide <b>diffraction</b> <b>angles.</b> The method is inexpensive and flexible towards possible changes in the design. We show advanced plans to make a prototype of an entirely spherical triple-GEM detector, including a spherical readout structure. This detector will have a superior position resolution, also at wide <b>diffraction</b> <b>angles,</b> and a high rate capability.

40|$|The {{applicability}} of residual stress analysis is expanded {{to the full}} 2 theta range, particularly to lower <b>diffraction</b> <b>angles</b> (2 θ<< 120 o), {{in order to be}} able to analyze residual stress in complex samples. For reliable results it is crucial that systematic errors are absent. The systematic errors considered in this paper are alignment errors like specimen displacement and incident beam misalignment. Verification measurements on a stress-free sample are required in combination with a suitable test criterion. A search in the standardization literature leads to three different criteria, which are compared with each other. From these three criteria only the Euronorm criterion appears to be generally applicable and is selected for further evaluation. Various experiments are performed to test different setups for their applicability at low <b>diffraction</b> <b>angles.</b> These experiments and the use of the Euronorm criterion lead to recommendations with respect to the applicable angular range. Only high <b>diffraction</b> <b>angles</b> (above 120 o) should be applied in case of the focusing optics geometry. Much lower angles (above 60 - 70 o) can be used when software corrections for alignment errors are applied in combination with the focusing optics geometry.

40|$|The Young's modulus of {{chromium}} nitride (CrN) films usually {{determined by}} complex and a destructive technique {{was obtained by}} conducting conventional X-ray diffraction and stress measurements. The CrN films were deposited onto (100) Si substrates by cathodic arc plasma deposition and then annealed in a N- 2 /H- 2 = 9 reducing atmosphere between 300 and 900 degreesC. X-Ray diffraction spectra revealed that the CrN main (220) peak was shifted from lower <b>diffraction</b> <b>angles</b> toward higher <b>diffraction</b> <b>angles</b> {{and then back to}} the standard reference angle with increasing temperature. Strains of the films were calculated from the corresponding interplanar spacing change associated with the peak shift. Residual stresses were determined by the curvature changes resulted from the annealing-induced stress relaxation. The Young's modulus of CrN films was then deduced from the linear relation of stresses and strains by considering residual stresses as plane stresses. The obtained value, 190 +/- 50 GPa, is comparable with those reported in the literature. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
