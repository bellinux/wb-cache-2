50|$|DMS is favoured by many European cable {{operators}} as the switching platform for their voice networks. The DMS-10 {{is widely used}} by rural wireline providers. DMS-100 and 200 switches are widely deployed throughout the U.S. and Canada by Regional Bell Operating Companies, Bell Canada and independent telephone companies {{as well as the}} US Military. The DMS-250 is the backbone of a number of carriers' long distance networks. The DMS-300 is an <b>international</b> <b>gateway</b> <b>switch,</b> and the DMS-500 is commonly deployed by competitive local exchange carriers because it combines DMS-100 and 250 capabilities.|$|E

50|$|Telecom Éireann {{rolled out}} digital {{telephone}} switching technology, {{across the country}} along with an extensive fibre optic and digital microwave backbone. Two digital switching systems were selected; CIT-Alcatel's E10 and Ericsson's AXE telephone exchange.Digital technology quickly replaced analogue systems at national and major regional switching centres and new <b>international</b> <b>gateway</b> <b>switches</b> were installed. The oldest electromechanical step-by-step exchanges and manual operator-manned local exchanges {{were the first to}} be converted to digital technology. More modern electromechanical crossbar exchanges, using Ericsson ARF technology dating from the 1960s and 1970s were converted to digital bit by bit through the late 1980s and early 1990s. These crossbar switches were capable of providing voice service that was comparable to digital switching technology.|$|R
50|$|International {{telephone}} calls are those made between different countries. These {{telephone calls}} are processed by <b>international</b> <b>gateway</b> exchanges (<b>switches).</b> Charges for these calls were high initially but declined greatly during the 20th century due to {{advances in technology}} and liberalization. Originally they were placed via long-distance operators. The calls were transmitted by cable, communications satellite, radio, and more recently, fiber optics and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). International Direct Dialling {{was introduced in the}} 1970s, so calls can be dialed by country code without an operator.|$|R
