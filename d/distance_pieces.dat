Special attention is given to testing the normality of the residuals which allows for a sound propagation of statistical errors from the experimental data to the potential parameters, phase-shifts, scattering amplitudes and counter-terms.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this report {{was to determine the}} effects of press temperature and pressing time on the density distribution of particleboards throughout the thickness, and to make clear the relation of the density distribution to the strength properties of these boards. Wood particle used in this experiment was splinter type (5 - 16 mesh) of Lauan. The bond used was phenol resin and its solid content was 6 % (OD) for weight of a particle-mat. <b>Distance</b> <b>piece</b> of 15 mm thick was used and press temperature was varied within the range of 130 to 190 °C, and pressing time 10 - 35 min. The density distribution of particleboard was measured by soft x-ray and densitometric method. The results obtained will be summarized as follows: (1) The percentages of thickness recovery of particleboards after hot-pressing decrease rapidly with increasing of pressing time as shown in Fig. 1, and critical pressing time is about 25 min for 130 °C of press temperature and about 15 min for 150 - 190 °C of press temperature. (2) The consolidation progress of each layer within particle-mat and the variation of density distribution of the particleboard through the thickness during hot-pressing are illustrated in Fig. 2 and 3. These figures indicate that the final type of density distribution of particleboards which are hot pressed with <b>distance</b> <b>piece</b> at the different press temperature in the range of 130 - 190 °C are not differ from each other. However, the density distribution of the particleboard which is hot-pressed without <b>distance</b> <b>piece</b> is differ from them (Fig. 4). (3) The bending strength of particleboards depend primarily on the density of the face (back), and so, the values are scarecely affected by press temperature and pressing time after the layers have been consolidated (Fig. 5). In contrast with this, the internal bonding strength depend chiefly on the density of the core layer, and so, the values are affected by the two factors till the consolidation progress of the layer has been completed (Fig. 6) ...|$|R

It is shown to contribute to the short <b>distance</b> <b>piece</b> at the same order of magnitude as the box diagram. Typeset using REVTEX 1 The phenomenon of meson mixing has been studied for a long time. Observed in the K 0 − ¯ K 0 and B 0 − ¯ B 0 systems, it provides an extremely sensitive test of the Standard Model (SM) and essential for the CP violation in the neutral meson system. It is well known that because of the GIM cancellation mechanism and large mass of the top quark the short distance box diagram dominates in B 0 − ¯ B 0 system and constitutes a significant fraction of the K 0 − ¯ K 0 mixing amplitude. The case of D 0 − ¯ D 0 system is somewhat special: the b-quark contribution to the fermion loop of the box diagram providing ∆C = 2 transition is diminished by a tiny Vub CKM matrix element. Thus, only the light quark mass difference guarantees that mixing does take place. The effect vanishes in the limit of the SU(3) invariance. All of that results in the estimated value for ∆mD being of the order of 10 − 17 GeV if only short distance contributions are taken into account [1], [2].

In the Standard Model (SM) these processes are forbidden at the tree level and are strongly suppressed by the GIM mechanism, in particular for up type quarks. Hence they offer a unique possibility to test the CKM sector of the SM and possibly open a window to physics beyond the SM. From the experimental side there is some data on the exclusive decay B !

40|$|Abstract. We {{show that}} because of the milder GIM suppression, the four-quark dipenguin {{operator}} contributes to the short <b>distance</b> <b>piece</b> of the D 0 − ¯ D 0 mixing amplitude at the same order of magnitude as the box diagram. In addition, we put an upper bound ∆mLDR D ≤ 5 × ∆mbox D on a long-distance resonant contribution induced by the penguin mixing. The phenomenon of meson mixing has been studied for a long time. Observed in the K 0 − ¯ K 0 and B 0 − ¯ B 0 systems, it provides an extremely sensitive test of the Standard Model (SM). Extremely large value of the top quark mass makes the short distance box diagram (e. g. Fig. 1 a) dominate B 0 − ¯ B 0 and K 0 − ¯ K 0 mixing amplitudes. This fact effectively turns GIM cancellation mechanism (vanishing of the total ∆Q = 2 contribution in the limit of equal internal quark masses) into the ”GIM-enhancement ” of the short-distance contribution to ∆mP for P = {K, B}. Long-distance contributions associated with the propagation of the hadronic degrees of freedom and higher-order QCD effects are relatively unimportant for the mixing of B and K mesons. The situation is drastically different {{in the case of the}} D 0 − ¯ D 0 system: the only available heavy b-quark contribution to the box diagram providing ∆C = 2 transition is greatly reduced by a tiny Vub CKM matrix element and can be safely neglected in the analysis of the box diagram contribution to ∆mD (the inclusion of the b-quark further decreases the box diagram contribution [1]). This forces the vanishing of the effect in the SU(3) limit and implies that only the light quark mass difference guarantees that mixing does take place. Calculating a box diagram and constructing the effective Hamiltonian, we realize that the smallness of the short <b>distance</b> <b>piece</b> is guaranteed by a factor of (m 2 s − m 2 d) 2 /m 2 c [2] (we define L = (1 + γ 5) / 2) Heff = G 2 F 2 π 2 ξsξd (m 2 s − m 2 d) 2 m 2 [ūγµLcūγµLc + 2 ūRcūRc c (1) ic Viu.

Its powder charge {{is less than a}} full service charge. This case is essential {{for the safety of the}} mount because it is needed to clear a gun after a misfire. Due to its importance, it is kept in a special container in the mount whenever the ship is in a combat zone. A misfire is especially dangerous in semi-fixed guns. When the breech is opened after the misfire, the faulty powder case can be extracted, but the projectile will remain jammed in the rifling. Also, all or part of the extracted case's cork plug may still be wedged in the chamber behind the projectile. This [...] "fouls" [...] the chamber because it decreases the chamber's volume. And, since Full and Reduced charge cases take up the full volume of an unfouled chamber (See loaded Semi-Fixed round drawing above), any residue left from the previously extracted case will prevent them from fully loading into the chamber. Therefore, the {{clearing charge}} is made short so that it will fit into a fouled chamber.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{disadvantages}} of a reciprocating compressor {{is that it}} generates pulsations and vibrations, which, without limitation and proper attention during design, manufacturing, installation and operation, can lead to fatigue failures, inefficiency, capacity limitations and unsafe situations. To judge {{the integrity of the}} compressor system, vibration levels are normally evaluated and for this purpose several international standards (API, ISO and VDI) have been developed the last decade. Besides international standards, there is a wide variety of internal guidelines, which have been developed and are being applied by compressor manufacturers, packagers, engineering offices and operators. Most of these internal guidelines have been derived from international standards. The lack in most of the international standards (and probably also the internal guidelines) is that they do not make a good distinction between recommended vibration levels for different parts of the compressor system, e. g. cylinder, crankcase, foundation, pulsation dampers, piping and/or different types/configurations of compressors e. g. horizontal/vertical, high/low speed, single/double <b>distance</b> <b>piece,</b> high/low power etc. Within the R&D group of the EFRC a project was started to develop an EFRC guideline which takes into account recommended vibration levels for different parts of the reciprocating compressor system.
