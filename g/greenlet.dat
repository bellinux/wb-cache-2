40|$|This report {{examines}} {{a solution}} for a topology-constructing library-extension for PyCSP 0. 5. 1. A set of often used topologies is first appointed after which solutions to four HPC-problems are implemented, each {{using one of the}} chosen topologies. The experience gained implementing the solutions is then used to establish the requirements for a sound, clean, simple and flexible topology-constructing extension package to PyCSP. The extension is implemented, tested and the four solutions are reimplemented using the new topology-constructors. The new imple-mentations of the HPC-solutions are then benchmarked against the original implementations. We have succeeded in implementing an easy-to-use yet very flexible library-extension, and benchmarking shows that practically no performance is lost using the extension compared to manually constructed topologies. Benchmarking also reveals that the resulting code is shorter and less complex. The extension may in its current form be used in the threading and multiprocessing parts of PyCSP 0. 6. 0 as well, though more work needs to be done if <b>greenlets</b> and networking nee...|$|R
60|$|Taking {{the above}} {{in the order}} here given, we have, first, two {{peculiar}} genera of true flycatchers, a family confined to the Old World, but extending over the Pacific {{as far as the}} Marquesas Islands. Next we have two peculiar genera (with four species) of honeysuckers, a family confined to the Australian region, and also ranging over all the Pacific Islands to the Marquesas. We now come to the most important group of birds in the Sandwich Islands, comprising seven or eight peculiar genera, and twenty-two species which are believed to form a peculiar family allied to the Oriental flower-peckers (Diceidæ), and perhaps remotely to the American <b>greenlets</b> (Vireonidæ), or {316} tanagers (Tanagridæ). They possess singularly varied beaks, some having this organ much thickened like those of finches, to which family some of them have been supposed to belong. In any case they form a most peculiar group, and cannot be associated with any other known birds. The last species, and the only one not belonging to a peculiar genus, is the Hawaiian crow, belonging to the almost universally distributed genus Corvus.|$|R
60|$|In birds {{also the}} {{similarities}} {{to our own}} familiar songsters first strike us, though the differences are perhaps really greater than in the quadrupeds. We see thrushes and wrens, tits and finches, and what seem to be warblers and flycatchers and starlings in abundance; but a closer examination shows the ornithologist that what he took for the {50} latter are really quite distinct, {{and that there is}} not a single true flycatcher of the family Muscicapidæ, or a single starling of the family Sturnidæ in the whole continent, while there are very few true warblers (Sylviidæ), their place being taken by the quite distinct families Mniotiltidæ or wood-warblers, and Vireonidæ or <b>greenlets.</b> In like manner the flycatchers of America belong to the totally distinct family of tyrant-birds, Tyrannidæ, and those that look like starlings to the hang-nests, Icteridæ; and these four peculiar families comprise about a hundred and twenty species, and give a special character to the ornithology of the country. Add to these such peculiar birds as the mocking thrushes (Mimus), the blue jays (Cyanocitta), the tanagers, the peculiar genera of cuckoos (Coccygus and Crotophaga), the humming-birds, the wild turkeys (Meleagris), and the turkey-buzzards (Cathartes), and we see that if there is any doubt as to the mammals of North America being sufficiently distinct to justify the creation of a separate region, the evidence of the birds would alone settle the question.|$|R
50|$|In 1965 {{she took}} charge of rescuing the {{destroyer}} USS Frank Knox. The destroyer had run aground on to Pratus Reef. A severe storm followed that further anchored the ship to the reef. It took the USS <b>Greenlet,</b> with her divers, and Fleet tugs about 40 days to finally pull the destroyer off the reef. The USS Frank Knox was then towed to a dry dock in Yokosuka Japan for repairs. USS <b>Greenlet</b> crew members, ENFN Fred Elliott, were assigned to assist on repairs.|$|E

500|$|Many species {{participate}} in mixed-species feeding flocks, forming {{a large percentage}} of the participating species within their range. Some of these are core or [...] "nuclear species". These nuclear species share territories with other nuclear species but exclude conspecifics (members of the same species) and are found in almost all flocks; these are joined by [...] "attendant species". Loud and distinctive calls and conspicuous plumage are important attributes of nuclear species as they promote cohesion in the flock. The composition of these flocks varies geographically; in Amazonia species of Thamnomanes antshrike are the leading nuclear species; elsewhere other species, such as the dot-winged antwrens and checker-throated antwrens, fill this role. Other species of antwren and antbird join them along with woodcreepers, ant-tanagers, foliage-gleaners and <b>greenlets.</b> The benefits of the mixed flock are thought to be related to predation, since many eyes are better for spotting predatory hawks and falcons. Comparisons between multi-species feeding flocks in different parts of the world found that instances of flocking were positively correlated with predation risk by raptors. For example, where Thamnomanes antshrikes lead the group they give loud warning calls in the presence of predators. These calls are understood and reacted to by all the other species in the flock. The advantage to the Thamnomanes antshrikes is in allowing the rest of the flock, which are typically gleaners, to act as beaters, flushing prey while foraging which the antshrikes can obtain by sallying. Similar roles are filled in other flocks by other antbird species or other bird families, for example the shrike-tanagers. Within the feeding flocks competition is reduced by microniche partitioning; where dot-winged antwrens, checker-throated antwrens and white-flanked antwrens feed in flocks together, the dot-wings feed in the densest vines, the white-flank in less dense vegetation, and the checker-throats in the same density as the latter but in dead foliage only.|$|R

5000|$|A salvage ship, the {{submarine}} rescue ship , arrived out of Sasebo on 20 December, {{to join the}} five destroyers and three anti-submarine airplanes {{at the site of}} the sinking. A hard hat diver was lowered to the scene. In a very short time he returned to the surface with a pair of new binoculars. In addition the Russian submarines had deployed during the depth charge a decoy that made all the sounds of a submarine. This Black Box was so top secret the <b>Greenlet</b> immediately returned to Pearl Harbor with it. Rumor has it the <b>Greenlet</b> was not allowed to return to the war area because it had retrieved so many Russian secrets. Perhaps it got their code books? Rumor also has it that 43 days later all the B girls knew everything that happened, but the crew couldn't say anything because they had signed the letters of secrecy. The story the crew was told was that it was a [...] "sunken Jap freighter the Iona Maru. Supposedly the Iona Maru capsized on 10 December 1950. The Navy brass had already formatted their cover story with the skipper of the USS <b>Greenlet.</b> [...] "If those binoculars were from WWII, why wasn't there debris or barnacles, on the item".
