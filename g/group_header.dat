The amplitude of the flow oscillation for the high powered tube varied from + 100 % to {minus} 150 % of the tube average flow. Reverse flow did not occur in the lower power tubes.

25|$|Raking {{courses in}} monk bond may—for instance—be {{staggered}} {{in such a}} way as to generate the appearance of diagonal lines of stretchers. One method of achieving this effect relies on the use of a repeating sequence of courses with back-and-forth header staggering.

In the next course up, a header is offset one and a half stretcher lengths to the left of the header in the course below, and then in the third course, a header is offset one stretcher length to the right of the header in the middle course. This accented swing of headers, one and a half to the left, and one to the right, generates the appearance of lines of stretchers running from the upper left hand side of the wall down to the lower right. Such an example of a raking monk bond layout is shown in the New Malden Library, Kingston upon Thames, Greater London.|$|R
40|$|Presented in {{this paper}} is the {{transient}} analysis of a <b>Group</b> Distribution <b>Header</b> (GDH) following a guillotine break {{at the end of}} the header. The GDH is the most important component of reactor safety in case of accidents. Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) piping is connected to the GDH piping such that, during an accident, coolant passes from the GDH into the ECCS. The GDH that is propelled into motion after a guillotine break can impact neighboring GDH pipes or the nearest wall of the compartment. The cases of GDH impact on an adjacent GDH and its attached piping are investigated {{in this paper}}. A whipping RBMK- 1500 GDH along with neighboring concrete walls and pipelines is modeled using finite elements. The finite element code NEPTUNE used in this study enables a dynamic pipe whip structural analysis that accommodates large displacements and nonlinear material characteristics.

40|$|The best-estimate {{calculation}} {{results from}} complex system codes {{are affected by}} approximations that are un-predictable {{without the use of}} computational tools that account for the various sources of uncertainty. Two uncertainty methodologies (the statistical methodology based on GRS approach and the CIAU - Code with the capability of Internal Assessment of Uncertainty) have been applied to the RBMK NPP distribution <b>group</b> <b>header</b> (DGH) blockage simulation. The statistical methodology allows building with the given reliability the confidence interval for the estimated parameter both in the case of unknown distribution {{and in the case of}} the normal distribution. It also allows finding the factors with the most essential influence on the result of calculation. In the framework of the statistical methodology the uncertainty analysis of the simulation of the damaged DGH parameters response is carried out in two stages: • base mode calculation (without uncertainty variations), definition of boundary conditions for a small subsystem (blocked DGH) : pressure and water enthalpy in pressure header (PH); pressure and void fraction in the point of connection of steam-water lines to drum separator (DS); • performance of variant calculations for the small subsystem: damaged DGH from PH to DS at constant (from calculation to calculation) boundary conditions. The distribution of the maximal power channel break times is received. This event leads to the scram initiation, and the upper boundary for the maximal fuel rod cladding and pressure tube temperatures of the channels at lower power is calculated. All calculations have been done with the help of RELAP 53. 2 code. The Code with (the capability of) Internal Assessment of Uncertainty (CIAU) has been proposed by the University of Pisa to realize the integration between a qualified best-estimate thermal-hydraulic system code (RELAP 53. 2) and a suitable uncertainty methodology (UMAE, Uncertainty Method based on Accuracy Extrapolation) and to supply proper uncertainty bands each time a nuclear power plant (NPP) transient scenario is calculated. S 6 - 37 - 2 The idea at the basis of the CIAU is connected with the status approach. Each status is characterized by the numerical value of relevant quantities and by the value of the time interval from transient start. The selected quantities characterize in a multidimensional space (i. e. a hypercube) the status of a LWR during any transient (LBLOCA, SBLOCA, operational transient, etc.). Then, uncertainty values are calculated and stored in each hypercube (Uq) and time interval (Ut). A Quantity Uncertainty Matrix (QUM), formed by hypercubes, and a Time Uncertainty Vector (TUV), formed by time intervals, can be set up. The application of CIAU is straightforward once QUM and TUV are available. The “error matrixes” and the “error vector” are currently used as post-processor of a CIAU calculation and their application to the RBMK NPP DGH Blockage calculation has been performed. Uncertainty evaluations for upper plenum pressure, mass inventory of the affected DGH Core channels and hottest rod clad temperature have been derived and continuous uncertainty bands have been generated...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{transients}} {{that have}} received considerable {{attention in the}} safety evaluation of RBMK reactors is the partial break of a <b>group</b> distribution <b>header</b> (GDH). The coolant flow rate blockage in one GDH might lead to excessive heat-up of the pressure tubes and can result in multiple fuel channels (FC) ruptures. In this work, the GDH flow blockage transient has been studied considering the Smolensk- 3 RBMK NPP (nuclear power plant). In the RBMK, each GDH distributes coolant to 40 – 43 [*]FC. To investigate the behavior of each FC belonging to the damaged GDH {{and to have a}} more realistic trend, one (affected) GDH has been schematized with its forty-two FC, one by one. The calculations were performed using the 0 -D NK (neutron kinetic) model of the RELAP 5 - 3. 3 stand-alone code. The results show that, during the event, the mass flow rate is disturbed differently according to the power distribution established for each FC in the schematization. The start time of the oscillations in mass flow rate depends strongly on the attributed power to each FC. It was also observed that, during the event, the fuel channels at higher thermal power values tend to undergo first cladding rupture leaving the reactor to scram and safeguarding all the other FCs connected to the affected GDH...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Kinesiology, 2011 The {{purpose of}} this study was to conduct a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, {{prospective}} study of soccer heading and its potential effects among male and female collegiate soccer players. Specifically, this study evaluated individual neck strength and accelerations experienced by the head during bouts of routine soccer heading and examined this information in regard to videorecorded exposure data and neurocognitive performance. The participants for the study included 51 Division-II collegiate soccer players from the Humboldt State University women???s (n= 27) and men???s (n= 24) (part 1 of study); 13 of them participated in part 2; 7 women, 6 men. All subjects were voluntarily recruited from the Humboldt State University soccer teams. For part 1 of the study, a self-report heading index was administered, pre and post-season neurocognitive (ImPACT) scores were collected, and four randomly selected practices and games were videorecorded for collection of exposure data. In part 2 of the study a handheld dynamometer (BIOPAC) was used to gather neck strength information and a tri-axial accelerometer (G-Link) was used to record accelerations experienced by the head during heading trials in which a soccer ball was ejected from a ball machine at a prescribed rate and trajectory. The results of the study supported the hypothesis that there would be no significant neurocognitive changes after a season of soccer heading for the group as a whole. However, there was a significant difference in visual memory change scores for the ???<b>header???</b> <b>group</b> versus the ???not a <b>header???</b> <b>group.</b> The hypothesis that there would be significant sex differences in neck strength and heading accelerations was also supported. However, males exhibited greater heading accelerations than females, contrary to initial expectations. Finally, the hypothesis that neck strength would be negatively correlated with heading accelerations was partially supported. Specifically, neck strength was positively correlated with accelerations experienced during flick-on headers. However, a number of additional non-significant trends for sex differences for each neck strength measure by header type were also supported...|$|R

40|$|We propose an {{automatic}} image and thumbnail carving tool called myKarve, which {{is useful in}} digital forensics investigation and presentation of evidential information. It is able to carve contiguous and linearly fragmented images caused by garbage, which is tested against three hypotheses to prove its authenticity. These images fall into three categories: images {{with one or two}} thumbnails or none at all; thumbnails with headers that do not follow the standard header patterns; and fragmentations caused by garbage. myKarve is designed on a new framework by extending Scalpel features to deal with thumbnail and fragmentation issues. The Validated Joint Photographic Experts <b>Group</b> (JPEG) <b>Header</b> (VJH) list and Address DataBase (ADB) are used to automatically generate work instructions in a work queue to initiate a fully automated image carving process. A shift-key-matching (SKM) technique is used to detect garbage that causes fragmentation in carved images or thumbnails before it can be cleaned. The tool is tested with Digital Forensics Research Work Shop (DFRWS) 2006 and 2007 data sets and images obtained from the Internet. myKarve is found to be a more efficient automated image and thumbnail carver compared to the original Scalpel with the following advantages: detects more headers using validated headers; carves more images and thumbnails by using the newly introduced image patterns; and is able to discard garbage from linearly fragmented images. The results from myKarve are invaluable in the fieldwork of digital forensic analysis and can produce technical evidence of cybercrime activities...|$|R

40|$|This PhD {{thesis is}} {{evaluating}} the safety {{level of the}} graphite-moderated boiling water cooled nuclear power reactors (RBMK reactors) {{by the use of}} best estimate three dimensional neutron kinetics coupled thermal-hydraulics codes. The availability of such sophisticated tools has allowed detailed and realistic analyses of these kind of reactors, also known as “Chernobyl-type” reactors. Chernobyl is the name of a RBMK reactor where, in 1986, a severe accident occurred, leading to the destruction of the plant and to a major release of radioactivity into the environment. Parts of the activities of this PhD thesis were developed in the framework of the European Union funded TACIS Project R 2. 03 / 97 “Software development for the RBMK and WWER reactors”. This project was awarded to the “Gruppo di Ricerca Nucleare San Piero a Grado” of the University of Pisa and managed by it in collaboration with the RBMK designers (NIKIET, Kurchatov Insititute) and the licensee (RosEnergoAtom, now EnergoAtom Concern OJSC). The research activities dealt with the development and the validation of a sophisticated thermal-hydraulic nodalization of the Smolensk- 3 Nuclear Power Plant. This thermal-hydraulic model was then coupled with a three dimensional neutron kinetics model of the core. The code used was RELAP 5 - 3 D system code. Suitable RBMK cross sections libraries were developed in collaboration with the Pennsylvania State University, using the deterministic lattice physics code HELIOS. After the validation of the developed models, the most relevant transients for the plant safety at full power were calculated, e. g. the <b>group</b> distribution <b>header</b> rupture, the break of the control and protection system cooling circuit. A special emphasis was put in the simulation of the single fuel channel transient, using also the Monte Carlo code MCNP 5. The last part of the PhD activities concerned the analysis of a low power transient. In particular, the Chernobyl extreme scenario was reconstructed. Xenon fuel cell cross sections were calculated using the deterministic transport code DRAGON. Finally, all the analyses performed in the framework of this PhD confirmed the upgraded level of nuclear safety of the RBMK reactors, obtained also {{as a consequence of the}} relevant hardware modifications implemented in the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Broadcast {{encryption}} aims at {{sending a}} content {{to a large}} arbitrary group of users at once. Currently, the most efficient schemes provide constant-size headers, that encapsulate ephemeral session keys under which the payload is encrypted. However, in practice, and namely for pay-TV, providers have to send various contents to different <b>groups</b> of users. <b>Headers</b> are thus specific to each group, one for each channel: as a consequence, the global overhead is linear {{in the number of}} channels.

Otherwise, the zapping time becomes unacceptably long. In this paper, we consider encapsulation of several ephemeral keys, for various groups and thus various channels, in one header only, and we call this new primitive Multi-Channel Broadcast Encryption – MIBE: one can hope for a much shorter global overhead and a short zapping time since the decoder already has the information to decrypt any available channel at once.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of variable practice in learning the header skill in soccer. Thirty nine young athletes aged 10 - 12 (M= 11. 6, SD= 0. 55) with a training experience of 2 years (M= 1. 75, SD= 0. 25) were randomly divided in two groups. The first experimental group (VPG, n= 20) followed a training program planned and organized by variable method of practice while the second experimental group (SPG, n= 19) followed a stable/constant practice method. Both methods aimed at learning of the header skill. The duration of the intervention was eight (8) weeks; three (3) times per week, for 20 min. Participants of both groups were measured before the intervention (pre-test), after eight weeks of intervention (post-test) and one week after the final test without having any practice at all of header skill (retention test). For the header skill evaluation the test of i-Soccer ([URL] was used. ANOVA repeated measures indicated that there was an interaction effect between measures and group. Analyzing the interaction for the repeated factor “measure”, a significant effect for variable group but not for stable <b>group</b> in the <b>header</b> skill was revealed. The athletes of variable group benefited from variable practice and they shaped the motor schema of header skill.

40|$|Aim: Shoulder {{complaints}} are frequent complaints of the musculoskeletal system in primary care. 44 - 80 % of all shoulder complaints derive from structural defects in the subacromial space and are <b>grouped</b> under the <b>header</b> of the Subacromial Pain Syndrome (SAPS). Guidelines recommend to treat SAPS initially conservatively. However, {{the success rate}} of the physiotherapy treatments varies between 20 and 79 %. The ShoulderNetwork (SNA) Amsterdam tries to provide optimal physiotherapy care in patients with shoulder complaints. SNA physiotherapists use the Egmond-Schuitemaker Protocol, in which {{the selection of a}} patient profile and a diagnostic group could provide optimal physiotherapy care for SAPS patients. At this moment, no information is available on the added value of ShoulderNetworks (SNs). This study indentifies (i) in what respect the patient population and care of the SNA physiotherapists differ from regular physiotherapists and (ii) to what extent the SNA physiotherapists treat patients according to the ES-Protocol. Method: An retrospective analysis of medical record data comparing both groups was conducted. Results: The percentage of patients with shoulder complaints was almost twice as high for SNA physiotherapists compared to regular physiotherapists. The number of treatment sessions was lower and duration of episode of care was shorter in SNA physiotherapists. The interventions used in the treatment sessions differs between SNA and reference group. Adherence to the ES-protocol varied per indicator as well as per SNA physiotherapist. Conclusion: Significant differences in patient population and content care were found between SNA physiotherapists and regular therapists. SNA physiotherapists have moderate adherence to the ES-protocol. Clinical Relevance: The care process of the ShoulderNetwork Amsterdam seems to be more efficient than regular care. To confirm this, further research must be done into the outcomes of care given by physiotherapists who are a member of a Shouldernetworks. Subsequently the possible (cost) effectiveness of ShoulderNetworks can be studied...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 Several {{recent studies}} have {{revealed}} that high caliber European professional soccer players often have diminished levels of neurological functioning, yet no study {{has been able to}} identify the specific aspect of soccer participation responsible for these decreases. In an effort to identify a source of mild traumatic brain injury present in everyday participation in soccer, this study investigated whether a single bout of heading a soccer ball would have acute detrimental, measurable effects on sensorimotor and neurocognitive functioning. We hypothesized that subjects would exhibit significant changes in postural stability, memory, and concentration immediately after an acute bout of repeated heading a soccer ball. Additionally, we evaluated the protective effect(s) associated with wearing a mouthguard while performing the acute bout of heading. Twenty-eight elite level soccer players (mean age, 20. 9 ± 2. 5 yrs) were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three experimental groups: Headers with mouthguard (n= 10), Headers with no mouthguard (n= 10), and Control (n= 8). Subjects in the two treatment <b>groups</b> performed 12 <b>headers</b> of soccer balls projected at 40 km/hr from an electric soccer ball-launching machine. Postural stability was evaluated using a Biodex Stability System, while memory and concentration were assessed using Wechsler Digit Span (WDS) tests (digits forward and digits backward) in a 3 x 2 factorial ANOVA design (α= 0. 05). There were no significant main effects or interactions among the three measures of postural stability scores in the three groups (p> 0. 05). The WDS Forward group means ranged from 10. 4 ± 1. 8 to 13. 5 ± 1. 2 while the WDS Backward means ranged from 6. 4 ± 1. 1 to 7. 7 ± 3. 0, but were not different among the groups (p> 0. 05). We concluded that a single bout of 12 soccer headers approximating the number of headers performed during a typical NCAA Division I-A soccer practice did not produce significant deficits in postural stability, memory, or concentration. While our findings are similar to several recent studies, we suggest that more sensitive measurement tools such as ImPACT neurocognitive testing and functional magnetic resonance imaging be utilized to determine the effects of acute as well as chronic exposure to headers in soccer players...|$|R
