5|$|During the 2012 Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Oracle Corp. support lawsuit, court {{documents}} unsealed by a Santa Clara County Court judge revealed that in 2008, Hewlett-Packard had paid Intel around $440 million to keep producing and updating Itanium microprocessors from 2009 to 2014. In 2010, {{the two companies}} signed another $250 million deal, which obliged Intel to continue making Itanium CPUs for HP's machines until 2017. Under {{the terms of the}} agreements, HP <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> chips it gets from Intel, while Intel launches Tukwila, Poulson, Kittson, and Kittson+ chips in a bid to gradually boost performance of the platform.|$|E
5|$|Once {{out of the}} hospital, Johnny Sack's {{daughter}} gets {{married and}} the Soprano family attends. There, Tony is shown very exhausted when taking off his shoes through security. In the process, he collapses to the ground, but is not hurt. Before the wedding, Johnny Sack is approved to leave prison for six hours to see his daughter get married, but <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the metal detectors {{and the presence of}} the U.S. marshals at the event. As his daughter is about to drive away, the SUV that was escorting Johnny to the wedding blocks the car from leaving and an altercation begins in the driveway. In a moment of weakness and despair, Johnny Sack cries as he is put back into handcuffs and driven back to prison, greatly diminishing the respect his crew and Tony's crew have for him.|$|E
25|$|A {{computer}} then instructs {{the user}} {{to go to a}} certain teletext page which has been assigned to the customer for that session. Usually the page initially contains a menu with options and the user chooses among the options using the buttons on the telephone. When a choice has been made, the selected page is immediately broadcast and can be viewed by the user. This is in contrast with usual teletext where the customer has to wait for the selected page to be broadcast, because the pages are broadcast sequentially. This technology enables teletext to be used for games, chat, access to databases etc. It allows one to overcome the limitations on the number of available pages. On the other hand, {{only a limited number of}} users can use the service at the same time, since one page is allocated per user. Some channels solve this by taking into account where the user is geographically calling from and by broadcasting different teletext pages in different geographical regions. In that way, two different users can be assigned the same page number at the same time as long as they do not receive the TV signals from the same source. Another drawback to the technology is the privacy concerns in that many users can see what a user is doing because the interactive pages are received by all viewers. Also, the user usually <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the telephone call to the TV station. For these reasons, these services have since been superseded by the World Wide Web.|$|E

500|$|A {{personal}} {{priority of}} Rutherford {{had been the}} establishment of a university. Though the Edmonton Bulletin opined that it would be unfair [...] "that the people of the Province should be taxed for the special benefit of four per cent that {{they may be able to}} attach the cognomen of B.A. or M.A. to their names and flaunt the vanity of such over the taxpayer, who <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> it", Rutherford proceeded quickly. [...] He was concerned that delay might result in the creation of denominational colleges, striking a blow to his dream of a high quality non-sectarian system of post-secondary education. A bill establishing the University was passed by the legislature, but left the government to decide the location. Calgary felt that, having lost the fight to be provincial capital, it could expect the university to be established there, and was not pleased a year later when the government announced the founding of the University of Alberta in Rutherford's hometown of Strathcona.|$|E

2500|$|Firstly, it {{all depends}} who <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the cost, {{and what kind of}} {{sanctions}} there are for polluters. If the state pays the cost out of general taxes, the costs to individual private enterprises would be much lower compared to their gains. It may be that some businesses gain from an environmentally friendly policy, while others do not, so that they are in competition with each other. Mathematicians would point out that the costs of clean air and water are only a very small component of total capital costs, but some argue that corporations are profitable precisely because they do not pay for externalities. According to Leontief Prize winner Duncan K. Foley, the perception that curbing greenhouse gases is [...] "costly" [...] assumes that capitalism is [...] "efficient" [...] without such controls, but if externality costs exist, it means precisely that capitalism is not at all operating at its [...] "efficiency frontier".|$|E

2500|$|In Șoimii, Sadoveanu's first {{historical}} novel, {{the main}} character is Nicoară Potcoavă, a late 16th-century Moldavian nobleman who became Hetman of the Zaporozhian Cossacks and Prince of Moldavia. The narrative, whose basic lines had been drawn by Sadoveanu in his adolescent years, focuses on early events in Nicoară's life, building on the story according to which {{he and his brother}} Alexandru were the brothers of Prince Ioan Vodă cel Cumplit, whose execution by the Ottomans they tried to avenge. The text also follows their attempt to seize and kill Ieremia Golia, a boyar whose alleged betrayal had led to Prince Ioan's capture, and whose daughter Ilinca becomes the brothers' prisoner. This story as well features several episodes where the focus is on depicting customary feasts, as well as a fragment where the Potcoavăs and their Zaporozhian Cossack allies engage in binge drinking. Glossing over several years in Nicoară's life, and culminating in his seizure of the throne, the narrative shows his victory against pretender Petru Șchiopul and Golia, and the price he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> his rise. Alexandru, who falls in love with Ilinca, unsuccessfully asks for the captured Golia not to be killed. Following the murder, both brothers become embittered and renounce power. Călinescu described Șoimii novel as [...] "still awkward", noting that Sadoveanu was only beginning to experiment with the genre.|$|E
