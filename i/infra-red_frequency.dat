40|$|Careful {{measurements}} of the equilibrium dissociation of nitrosyl chloride into nitric oxide and chlorine {{have been made in}} the temperature range 100 – 220 °. Pressure‐temperature measurements at 0 °‐ 100 ° on mixtures of nitrosyl chloride and nitric oxide were made and from them the second virial coefficients of nitrosyl chloride gas were calculated. These vary from - 389 cm^ 3 /mole at 0 ° to - 196 cm^ 3 /mole at 100 °. The virial coefficients were used to correct the measured equilibrium constants to those for perfect gases. Equations for free energy, entropy and heat content changes accompanying the dissociation were derived as functions of the temperature. The experimentally found entropy changes for the reaction were found to be less than those calculated from spectroscopic data by 3. 61 ± 0. 3 cal. /deg. To attain agreement, the spectroscopic entropy of nitrosyl chloride must be increased by 1. 8 cal. /deg., and this was attained by assuming that an observed <b>infra‐red</b> <b>frequency</b> at 923 cm^(‐ 1) is a combination, 633 + 290 cm^(‐ 1).

40|$|Metamaterials {{can provide}} many {{different}} functionalities and striking optical properties, whereby the optical control often comes from metallic building blocks which exhibit plasmonic resonances in the optical and <b>infra-red</b> <b>frequency</b> regimes. However, {{one of the}} major obstacles in the use of metallic elements is the overcoming of the losses in plasmonic structures. In this thesis, we consider how mode hybridisation can be used to circumvent these losses using cut-wire plasmonic arrays coupled to photonic slab waveguides. The resulting hybrid modes can have low loss characteristics and we investigate how the geometric parameters of the structure can be used to control the transmission and dispersion properties. We then investigate finite arrays finding they can support modes with extremely high quality factors (Q∼ 4000), which is highly unusual in plasmonic systems, and that the individual loss mechanisms can be controlled via the geometry. In {{the second part of the}} thesis we consider another type of surface mode, the spoof SPP. Theoretical methods for describing spoof SPPs in perfectly conducting materials are well established, enabling the design of an arbitrary spoof plasma frequency. However, for dispersive materials there have been a lack of theoretical studies. We begin by considering first how small changes to the spoof plasmon geometry affect the characteristics of spoof SPP waves, adapting the coupled mode method to slanted geometries and even right-angled triangular indentations, a structure not normally associated with spoof SPPs. We then develop a formalism based on the coupled mode method allowing the dispersion of real metal spoof SPPs to be understood and tuned, thus enabling control of the optical spoof SPP characteristics via both the geometry and the incorporated materials. This method also enables an in depth look at the modal losses which occur once dispersive materials are incorporated into the spoof plasmon dispersion relation and vary drasticallywith the groove width.

A correlation is evidenced for clean surfaces, but for hydroxylated surfaces, OH groups, though weak Brønsted bases, are much more active than oxide O 2 - ions. Some of the hydroxyl groups whose νOH infra-red stretching band {{is included in the}} narrow high-frequency OH band were shown to be responsible for such activity.

40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{observe the}} tuning of metamaterials through the relative {{rotation of the}} elements about their common axis. In contrast to previous results we observe a crossing of resonances, where the symmetric and anti-symmetric modes become degenerate. We associate this effect with an interplay between the magnetic and electric near-field interactions and verify this by calculations based on the interaction energy between resonators. Metamaterials created as an array of sub-wavelength, resonant elements can exhibit interesting electromagnetic properties, such as a negative refractive index 1. Unlike the atoms in natural materials, the near-field patterns of metamaterial elements are quite complex, giving rise to strong interactions between them. Understanding this interaction is essential as it determines the overall reso-nant properties and effective parameters of the material. By controlling the relative arrangement of elements, {{it is possible to}} change this coupling and tune the properties of the structure 2 – 4. This allows us to alter the response of the material substantially without having to greatly alter the geometry or constituents. An important building block of metamaterials is the Split Ring Resonator (SRR) 5, which can exhibit a nega-tive magnetic response due to its strongly resonant mag-netic polarizability. By coupling a pair of SRRs, chiral properties 6 and trapped dark modes 7 can also be ob-served. In this Letter, we study the dynamics of two microwave SRRs broadside coupled to each other, vary-ing twist angle θ between them, as shown in Fig. 1 (a).

The influence of the ligand X, cis to the sulphide (selenide and telluride) ligands, on the protons of the α and β carbon atoms of L has been investigated by means of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

40|$|The {{progress}} of large-area 2 D- and 3 D-photonic crystals (PCs) at optical and near <b>infra-red</b> <b>frequencies</b> {{has been limited}} by fabrication challenges. Periodic nanostructures must be patterned in high-index and crystalline material such as silicon over large areas (mm² to cm²) with reasonable throughput. These patterns also must be placed coherently over the entire area, and contain controlled defects. No single conventional nanoscale patterning technique is able to fulfil all of these requirements simultaneously. Pattern placement and throughput challenges for planar lithography can be addressed by combining spatial-phase-locked electron-beam lithography (SPLEBL) with lowenergy (sub- 2 keV) electrons. SPLEBL obtains feedback on the electron-beam position using a reference grid placed {{on top of the}} resist. Combining low-energy lithography with SPLEBL places strict requirements on the SPLEBL reference grid. A systematic investigation on a suitable grid material is carried out, and a self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) based grid is fabricated and characterized. Another method of fabricating large area planar PCs is through interference lithography (IL). The key challenge is the inability of IL to pattern defects or non-periodic structures and thermal scanning probe lithography (TSPL) is proposed as a complementary technique to IL. Integrating TSPL with IL requires capability to transfer TSPL-fabricated patterns into underlying material and is challenging due to the thermal-mechanical nature of TSPL. A robust pattern transfer process is designed and the effects of the lithography and etch processes on resolution and line-edge roughness is studied. The membrane-stacking approach, where large-area membranes are fabricated in parallel and then stacked to form a 3 D-PC, was proposed as a more efficient method of fabricating 3 D-photonic crystals (3 D-PCs) compared to conventional fabrication methods. There exists a need to develop techniques capable of fabricating, transferring and assembling these membranes. In this thesis, a membrane-on-carrier (MOC) strategy based on the membrane-stacking approach is proposed. Membranes are fabricated and floated on liquid, and then transferred onto a temporary rigid carrier. The key challenge is in separating the membrane from the rigid carrier onto a receiving substrate. A dissolvable separation layer is introduced between the membrane and carrier, and two membranes are stacked on top of another as proof-of-concept. Finally, azimuthal alignment is incorporated into the process. by Lin Lee Cheong. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The thermal {{expansion}} of magnesium oxide has been measured below room temperature from 140 °K to 284. 5 °K, using an interferometric method. The {{accuracy of measurement}} is better than 3 % in the temperature range studied. The agreement of these results with Durand's is quite good, but consistently higher {{over most of the}} range by 2 or 3 %, for the most part within the estimated experimental error. The Grüneisen parameter remains constant at about 1. 51 over the present experimental range; but an isolated measurement of Durand at 85 °K suggests that at lower temperatures it rises quite sharply above this value. This possibility is therefore investigated theoretically. With a non-central force model to represent MgO, γ(− 3) and γ(2) are calculated and it is found that γ(− 3) > γ(2), again suggesting that the Grüneisen parameter increases with falling temperature.

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{identified}} large quantum mechanical {{effects in the}} dynamics of liquid water. In this paper, we suggest that these effects may have been overestimated due {{to the use of}} rigid water models and flexible models in which the intramolecular interactions were described using simple harmonic functions. To demonstrate this, we introduce a new simple point charge model for liquid water, q-TIP 4 P/F, in which the O [...] H stretches are described by Morse-type functions. We have parameterized this model to give the correct liquid structure, diffusion coefficient, and <b>infra-red</b> absorption <b>frequencies</b> in quantum (path integral-based) simulations. By comparing classical and quantum simulations of the liquid, we find that quantum mechanical fluctuations increase the rates of translational diffusion and orientational relaxation in our model by a factor of around 1. 15. This effect is much smaller than that observed in all previous simulations of simple empirical water models, which have found a quantum effect of at least 1. 4 regardless of the quantum simulation method or the water model employed. The small quantum effect in our model is a result of two competing phenomena. Intermolecular zero point energy and tunneling effects destabilize the hydrogen bonding network, leading to a less viscous liquid with a larger diffusion coefficient. However this is offset by intramolecular zero point motion, which changes the average water monomer geometry resulting in a larger dipole moment, stronger intermolecular interactions, and slower diffusion. We end by suggesting, on the basis of simulations of other potential energy models, that the small quantum effect we find in the diffusion coefficient is associated with the ability of our model to produce a single broad O-H stretching band in the infra-red absorption spectrum.

40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis {{is concerned with the}} study by spectroscopic methods of the metal - halogen bond in complexes of a variety of metal ions in various stereochemistries and oxidation states. The complexes chosen for study contained, in addition to the halogeno-ligands Cl, Br and I, tertiary phosphines, and hence spectroscopic studies of the metal - phosphorus bond have also been possible. The spectroscopic techniques used were those of low frequency infra-red; ¹H, ¹³C and ³¹P NMR; and electronic absorption spectroscopy. Three distinct but related systems have been investigated. 1) Four - coordinate complexes of nickel (II), palladium (II) and platinum (II) (all square planar), and of cobalt (II) and zinc (II) (both tetrahedral), of form MX₂L₂ (where X = Cl, Br, I; L = PEt₃ and Et₂PhP), and binuclear halogen-bridged species of form M₂X₄L₂ (M = Pd, Pt; L = PEt₃; X is as above) have been prepared and studied. Attempts to prepare four-coordinate rhodium (I) complexes of triethylphosphine and diethylphenylphosphine are also described. The complexes have been studied by the spectroscopic techniques outlined above and the results related, where possible, {{to the nature of the}} metal - halogen bond. In particular, chemical shift trends with change in halogen for ¹H, ¹³C and ³¹P NMR spectra have been related to a component of Mδπ→Xδπ metal- halogen π-bonding in the complexes. Other explanations for the observed deshielding trends, most notably the paramagnetic anisotropy of the diamagnetic d⁸ metal ion, have also been examined in the light of the constancy of resonances in the NMR spectra of zinc (II) complexes with change in halogen. In the infra-red spectra of the complexes, revised assignments have been made for the metal - phosphorus stretching vibrations, and an intense absorption near 200 cm -¹ has been assigned to the metal - phosphorus - carbon bending mode. 2) (a) Rhenium (V) halogeno - phosphine complexes containing oxo or nitride ligands have been prepared and studied. These compounds have the form ReOX₃L₂ and ReNX₂L₃ (X = Cl,Br,I; L = PEt₃, Et₂PhP). The stereochemistries of the oxo complexes have been elucidated from NMR spectra by an analysis of the different methyl resonance multiplicities for cis and trans phosphine ligands. In addition to the NMR studies, the low <b>frequency</b> <b>infra-red</b> and electronic spectra of the complexes have been recorded and principal absorptions assigned. (b) Rhenium halogeno-phosphine complexes containing nitric oxide as a ligand have been prepared and studied by ¹H NMR, infra-red and electronic absorption spectroscopy. The complexes have the form ReX₃(NO) L₂ (X = Cl,Br,I; L = Et₂PhP), with rhenium in the divalent oxidation state. This was suspected from magnetic moment measurements and confirmed from the communicated results of a single crystal X-ray structure determination of a related chloro complex. The electronic spectra can be interpreted in terms of divalent rhenium with the d⁵ electron configuration. The ReX₃(NO) L₂ complexes can be reduced to the univalent rhenium complexes, ReX₂(NO) L₃, with sulphite ion in the presence of excess ofphosphine. Variations in the preparations of ReX₃(NO) L₂ complexes have been studied. Thus, bubbling nitric oxide through solutions of ReX₃L₃ complexes gives ReX₃(NO) L₂ species. In contrast, ReX₄L₂ compounds undergo no reaction with nitric oxide. Other preparative methods investigated were (i) thermal decomposition of Ag₂ReX₆ (X = Cl,Br) salts in a stream of nitric oxide and treatment of the residues with Et₂PhP to give the univalent rhenium complexes, ReX₂(NO) (Et₂PhP) ₃ and, (ii), reaction of the anion [Re₅(No) ] ⁻² with Et₂PhP did not lead to identifiable products. (c) The phosphine complex chemistry of technetium has been briefly investigated and shown to be analogous with that of rhenium. 3) Octahedral ruthenium (III) and ruthenium (II) complexes have been prepared and studied by ¹H, ¹³C and ³¹P NMR; low <b>frequency</b> <b>infra-red,</b> and electronic absorption spectroscopy. The complexes have the form RuX₃L₃ (X = Cl, Br; L = PEt₃, Et₂PhP) for ruthenium (III) and RuX₃(NO) L₂ (X = Cl,Br,I; L = PEt₃, Et₂PhP) for ruthenium (II). In addition, para-substituted phenyldiethylphosphine ligands (p-QPhEt₂P; Q = Me₂N, MeO, Cl) have been prepared and their complexes with ruthenium (II) of stoichiometry RuX₃(NO) L₂ have been studied. The electronic effects of the para-substituents can be correlated with changes in spectroscopic parameters such as the nitrosyl <b>infra-red</b> stretching <b>frequency</b> and the energy of halogen to metal charge transfer transitions in the ultra-violet region. The overall results for these three systems have been compared and contrasted, and a general conclusion is that although δ bonding is the major component of the covalent contribution to the metal - halogen bond, the existence of a component of metal to halogen Mδπ→Xδπ bonding appears to be the best explanation for a number of trends observed in the spectroscopic data...|$|R

At the high EO/Li ratio (i. e., 30), the intensity of bands increases and a triplet appears at 1, 045 cm− 1, indicating the presence of free anions, ionic pairs and aggregates.

Though pioneering experiments were performed in trapped atom and trapped ion systems, solid state systems show promise of being scalable and robust. Rare earth dopants in crystalline hosts are an appealing option because they possess a rich spectrum of energy levels that result from a partially filled electron orbital. While level structure varies across the period, all elements possess crystal field splittings corresponding to near <b>infra-red</b> or optical <b>frequencies,</b> as well as Zeeman and often hyperfine levels separated by radio frequency and microwave frequencies. These levels demonstrate long excited-state lifetimes and coherence times and have been used in diverse applications, including demonstrating storage of a photonic state, converting of optical to microwave photons, and manipulating a single ion as a single qubit. The ions' weak interaction with their environment results in low coupling to optical fields, which had previously required measurements with macroscopically large ensembles of ions. Coupling the ions to an optical cavity enables the use of a smaller ensemble, which is required {{for the development of the}} aforementioned technologies in an on-chip scalable architecture. This thesis contains recent progress towards fabricating optical micro and nanocavities coupled to ensembles of erbium ions, mainly erbium in yttrium orthosilicate.

These devices coupled evanescently to erbium ions below the ring, in the bulk substrate. Simulation, design, fabrication, and characterization of both resonators are discussed.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into five chapters. In the first chapter clay {{structure}} and classification is discussed. In the second chapter studies of X-ray powder diffraction patterns, and near infra-red spectra are discussed. The third chapter describes the techniques used to obtain far infra-red spectra, the fourth chapter describing in detail the equipment used for this survey. The fifth chapter deals with the observations made in this survey on the far infra-red spectra of kaolins and related clays, and compares results obtained herein with results obtained by other workers. The equipment used was a Michelson-Morley far infra-red interferometer covering the spectral range 10 cm"^ to 500 cm ^. This was a commercial instrument manufactured as the "N. P. L. Cube MK. II" by Grubb Parsons of Newcastle-on-Tyne. Although this instrument is, in general, soundly built, several design defects caused noisy spectra. Inadequate screening of the detector against electrical interference, mechanical vibrations, and draughts (thermal fluctuations) led to unacceptable peaks in the interferograms. Poor source stabilisation caused noise on the interferograms. Inadequate source cooling caused occasional extinguishment of the source. Attempts to eradicate those faults gave spectra sufficiently clear for a first survey only. An earlier prototype Michleson-Morley interferometer, which existed in the Physics Department at Exeter University, was to have provided the spectra. It was of a better design than the "N, P. L. Cube", However, it had sustained {{a great deal of}} mechanical damage. Water vapour calibration spectra wore produced, and much useful experience in instrumentation for far infra-red interferometry was gained. No useful clay spectra were produced from this instrument. A Beckman-R. I. I. C. 2 OO far infra-red interferometer was available for use, in the Physics Department of Heriot Watt University. It was capable of giving noise free spectra for frequencies lower than 200 cm""^. It had the additional advantages of radiation polarising and specimen orientation facilities. <b>Infra-red</b> spectra for <b>frequencies</b> above 400 cm ^ were obtained on a Perkin-Elmer 257 grating spectrophotometer, using standard k 3 r disc transmission techniques. Spectra for the range 100 cm"*^ to 450 cm ^ were produced using powdered specimen embedded in polythene discs,' or thinly cleaved mica sheets, with the Grubb Parsons interferometer. The spectra over the ranges 10 - 50 cm ^ and 4 C- 200 cm ^ were produced using polythene discs, or cleaved specimens on the Beckman R. I. I. C. interferometer. Preliminary spectra showed that modes in the far infra-red region often exhibited couplings between pairs of modes characteristic of separate parts of the structure. The raising of degeneracies predicted by previous workers^ was observed for some clays. The influence of internal hydroxyl ions on some of the far infra-red modes was observed. Modes assignable to surface bound cations in the micas were observed; and re-assigned where previous workers had mistakenly confused them with other modes. A conflict exists between clay mineralogists over the assignment of several low frequency modes (l- 4). One group assigns the modes to the internal hydroxyls as noted above, whereas the second group assigns the modes to the tetrahedral parts of the clay structure. The experiments carried out in this study did not resolve this conflict completely. However, evidence was provided for the more precise assignments of some of the modes than had been previously obtained. Although Raman spectra were not obtained in this work, results of other workers"^ were used to assist in the assignment of some weak modes noticed in the far infra-red spectra of kaolins and micas used in this survey. It was possible to calculate possible difference modes from the frequencies of bands observed in the spectra obtained in the range 400 - 4000 cm'"*". Many of the difference frequencies were found to be close to the frequencies of certain of the bands observed in the spectra in the range 100 - 450 cm A possible correlation between certain X-ray powder diffraction line intensities and infra-red absorption strength of the hydroxyl stretch band of kaolins was noted. Also, kaolins which exhibited the least perturbation of the mode at 270 cm"*^ had the strongest hydroxyl stretch band absorption strength (at about 3620 cm ^). Conclusions and suggestions for further work appear at the end of chapter 5. In particular, studies of infra-red spectra of clays before and after dehydroxylation could possibly resolve some ambiguities of interpretation of certain far infra-red modes. Also, more information could be obtained on possible difference modes by studying their temperature dependance...|$|R

[...] Boston UniversityThe study of infra-red and Raman spectra {{and their relationship}} to the vibrations and rotations of atoms in molecules has become more and more a matter of interest to the physicist and chemist within the past several decades. The study of the vibrations of the atoms which give rise to the broad band spectra in the near infra-red has led to a more thorough understanding of the forces in the molecules including a theoretical explanation of valence. The study of the rotation of groups of atoms within a molecule as well as the rotation of molecules as a whole which give rise to the band spectra in the far infra-red and to fine structure in the near infra-red has led to a rather accurate means for determining the structure of molecules. This paper deals with the theoretical determination of the vibrational frequencies of 1, 3 - butadiene. As is well known, the frequencies obtained from a quantum mechanical treatment of the problem are the same as those resulting from a classical determination; consequently, though the quantum mechanical methods are outlined, the actual calculations are carried out by the classical method of treating small oscillations. The normal frequencies of vibration determined for an oscillating system having particles of masses equal to those of the masses of the atoms with force constants of magnitude equal to the forces actually existing in a molecule will be the same as the <b>infra-red</b> and Raman <b>frequencies.</b> In general the force constants are unknown so that the problem essentially has to be worked backward by carrying it out algebraically and then, by making use of observed spectra, determining the force constants. For a large molecule, such as butadiene, this is not easy nor even feasible. Consequently, force constants determined by others for smaller molecules where the structure of part of the molecule is similar to a part of butadiene are used for a determination of the normal frequencies. The force constants in this work were transferred from the work on propylene by Wilson and Wells^ 1 and from a paper on force constants in organic molecules by Crawford and Brinkley^ 2. The cis-form was selected as the normal configuration for butadiene. The force field chosen was the valence type field. This means that the changes in bond length and changes in the bond angles from the equilibrium configuration were chosen as the coordinates for the potential function. The application of group theory to the symmetry in the molecule factored the secular equation obtained from the coefficients of the variables in the kinetic and potential energy expressions from a determinant of order twenty four to four determinants of order nine, eight, four and three. Since the latter two contained only out-of-plane vibrations and would thus give zero frequencies with the type of force field chosen, only the two equations of order nine and eight had to be solved. These are, however, in determinantal form, and the process of expanding secular equations of this size is, in general, very laborious and tedious. In order {{to reduce the amount of}} labor involved, an approximation scheme was attempted. As a first approximation, the carbon-hydrogen bond force constants, both stretching and bending, were considered infinite. This served then to increase the mass of the carbon atoms slightly while eliminating the hydrogen frequencies. Two secular equations of order three and two had to be expanded, which yielded an approximate value for the carbon skeletal vibrational frequencies. Secondly, the carbon masses were considered infinite and then the motions of the hydrogen atoms with respect to the carbon atoms were determined. This required the expansion of two secular equations of order five and four. In the process of making these approximations, three frequencies disappeared, which should have or would have been determined by an exact expansion of the original secular equations. A method was then used for an exact expansion of the secular equations which was due to J. G. Bryan^ 3 and was developed for expanding matrix characteristic equations and determining the latent vectors or characteristic vectors of a characteristic equation. The characteristic equation of a matrix is defined by |A-λI| = 0 where A is the original matrix and I is the unit matrix. While the secular equation is not, in general, in the form defined above, it can be put into this form by adding and subtracting rows and columns or multiples of rows and columns until the variable terms appear only on the diagonal and then dividing each column by the coefficient of the variable in that column. Since the secular equation will then be in the form as defined above, it is possible to make use of Bryan's method for an exact expansion of the characteristic equation. The method is described completely and the expansion of the eighth order secular equation is carried out in detail as an illustration of the method. The actual expansion of the secular equations by this process requires less time and effort, in general, than the approximation scheme. This method has an additional advantage in that a continual check is provided on the numerical work as the expansion proceeds. Furthermore, the method is readily adaptable to I. B. M. automatic punch card computors which can result in an additional saving in time and effort while at the same time carrying out an exact expansion rather than an approximation with its attendant loss or shift of frequencies. After the equations were expanded, they were solved by Horner's method yielding the seventeen required roots. These roots were proportional to the normal frequencies of vibration of the molecule and after solving for the frequencies in terms of wave numbers, they were compared with observed frequencies. The comparison showed a fairly good agreement between the observed and calculated frequencies. A comparison was also made between the frequencies obtained by the exact expansion and the approximation. This showed that the carbon vibrations in the approximation were all fairly uniformly displaced by about two hundred wave numbers toward lower frequencies as is to be expected from the general theory of small oscillations. The hydrogen frequencies were displaced by an even larger amount as also was to be expected but not in as regular a manner as the carbon oscillations. The results of this paper again indicate that it is possible to transfer force constants from parts of one molecule to another where they exist in similar surroundings. The fairly good correlation between the observed and calculated frequencies indicates that the force constants as chosen are very nearly the correct values. Probably of more significance in this paper is the application of Bryan's method to the exact expansion of the secular equation. This eliminates the necessity of introducing approximations, and the expansion can be carried out with less work and more of a check on the work than previously. This expansion as well as the solution of the expanded equation can be carried out on I. B. M. computors. Furthermore, the determination of the normal modes, which requires the solution of the ratios of the minors of any row of the secular equation with a given value for the frequency substituted, was perk formed by Crout's^ 4 method for the solution of determinants which is also readily adaptable to I.
