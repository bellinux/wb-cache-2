Therefore, genetically modified (<b>GM)</b> <b>protein</b> or DNA {{from the original}} GM crop from which it is derived often is undetectable [...] - [...] in other words, it is not substantially different from lecithin derived from non-GM crops. Nonetheless, consumer concerns about genetically modified food have extended to highly purified derivatives from GM food, such as lecithin. This concern led to policy and regulatory changes in the European Union in 2000, when Commission Regulation (EC) 50/2000 was passed which required labelling of food containing additives derived from GMOs, including lecithin. Because {{it is nearly impossible}} to detect the origin of derivatives such as lecithin, the European regulations require those who wish to sell lecithin in Europe to use a meticulous, but essential system of identity preservation (IP).|$|E

The metabolism of nitrogen and minerals are important to any age group but it is especially significant in college-age women. An opportunity was provided to study nitrogen and mineral metabolism during weight loss in college-age women living in a cooperative dormitory at the University of Nebraska. The nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus and magnesium metabolism was studied during the time they consumed a low-caloric, high-protein diet. Metabolism studies were made for seven consecutive days for each of three periods. All subjects received an average of 1033 calories and 78. 9 <b>gm</b> <b>protein</b> during the first metabolic period. During the second metabolism period they were given 1132 calories and 83. 0 <b>gm</b> <b>protein.</b> In the third metabolism period, the subjects were divided into three different groups; Group I received 940 calories and 77. 7 <b>gm</b> <b>protein,</b> Group II received 1026 calories and 83. 6 <b>gm</b> <b>protein.</b> In the same period subject N received 1236 calories and 87. 5 <b>gm</b> <b>protein</b> for maintenance of her weight.

40|$|Dogs with {{sustained}} anemia and hypoproteinemia due to {{bleeding and}} a continuing low protein or protein-free diet with abundant iron {{are used to}} test the value of food proteins as contrasted with mixtures of pure amino acids. The stimulus of double depletion (anemia and hypoproteinemia) drives the body to use every source of protein and all protein-building materials with the utmost conservation. Raiding of body tissue protein to produce plasma protein and hemoglobin is a factor when protein-building factors are supplied in small amounts. In this severe test (double depletion) the good food proteins in adequate amounts are able to maintain body weight, a strongly positive nitrogen balance, and produce considerable amounts of new hemoglobin and plasma protein. Casein, lactalbumin, whole egg protein, liver protein are all adequate in amounts of 150 to 250 <b>gm.</b> <b>protein</b> per week. Under comparable conditions mixtures of pure amino acids (essential for growth) do produce large amounts of new hemoglobin and plasma protein and a positive nitrogen balance but do not maintain body weight. The loss of weight is conspicuous even with large amounts of amino acids (200 to 300 <b>gm.</b> <b>protein</b> equivalent per week). Methionine, threonine, and phenylalanine are related to nitrogen conservation in growth mixtures of essential amino acids (Paper I) but when these three are given together they have little influence on the doubly depleted dog (Table 3).

The sedimentation coefficient, so 20,w in pH 5 acetate buffer containing 0. 1 NaCl (total [Gamma]/ 2 = 0. 20) was 4 S. At pH 7 and above, a two-peak schlieren pattern was observed, the faster component (about 7 S) probably representing a dimer. On {{the basis of an}} s 20,w of 3. 9 S; a D 20,w of 5. 43 x 10 - 7 cm 2 /second, and a iV of 0. 73 ml/gm, a molecular weight of 68, 000 was calculated (0. 10 acetate, NaCl, [Gamma]r/ 2 = 0. 45) for the homogeneous component at pH 5. From free-boundary electrophoresis data the isoelectric point of Concanavalin A was determined to be 7. 1 +/- 0. 1. Starch gel electrophoresis patterns of concanavalin A in borate buffer (pH 8. 6) were characterized by an anodically migrating streak. Incorporation of -glucose into the gel gave a single sharp band which migrated slowly toward the cathode, the glucose probably inhibiting protein-starch interaction. Gel filtration experiments with Biogel P- 100 suggested that at pH 5 the molecular weight of Concanavalin A is in the vicinity of 50, 000; at pH 7. 5 concanavalin A is completely excluded, an indication that a high molecular weight species probably is formed by the association of subunits. Concanavalin A has an extinction coefficient, E 1 % 1 cm of 11. 4 +/- 0. 1, the molar ratio Mtyrosine/ Mtryptophan being 1. 78. Unlike other phytohemagglutinins, concanavalin A does not contain cysteine (or cystine) or carbohydrate.

40|$|In {{view of the}} {{findings}} that a diet low in calories resulted in a lowered calcium and phosphorus retention, and that increased protein intake increased calcium and phosphorus retention, it seemed pertinent to investigate the calcium and phosphorus retention {{of a group of}} college-age women when on a reducing diet low in calories but high in protein. This was done by comparing the calcium and phosphorus retention of one group of college-age women on a diet containing 60 <b>gm</b> of <b>protein</b> daily with that of another group of college women receiving 110 <b>gm</b> of <b>protein</b> daily. Metabolism studies were made for 2 consecutive days for each of 8 weeks on 2 groups of 7 college-age women on a reducing diet. Both groups received 1200 calories daily, but Group I received 60 <b>gm</b> of <b>protein</b> daily and Group II received 110 <b>gm</b> of <b>protein</b> daily. The effect of the two types of reducing diets on calcium and phosphorus retention was studied. In Group I the average daily calcium intake was 1. 221 gm and the retention was 0. 107 gm, and in Group II the average daily calcium intake was 1. 410 gm, and the excretion exceeded the intake of 0. 074 gm. Group I had a corresponding phosphorus intake of 1. 162 gm and the excretion exceeded the intake 0. 008 gm, and Group II had an intake of 1. 555 gm and had a retention of 0. 013 gm. Both groups were essentially in equilibrium for both minerals, but did not attain the retentions expected for this age group. The plausible causes for the lower retention of calcium and phosphorus during weight reduction and the variation between the retention of the two groups are discussed. It is suggested that the low fat content and the low caloric content of the reducing diet caused the lowered calcium and phosphorus retention. This study indicates a need for further study of the effect of different levels and different kinds of fat on calcium and phosphorus absorption and retention, especially when calories are limited.

40|$|Proteinuria {{in normal}} dogs can be {{produced}} at will by parenteral injections of dog plasma. As the plasma injections are continued the plasma protein concentration rises {{and at some point}} protein begins to appear in the urine. The level of plasma protein concentration at which proteinuria appears in normal dogs ranges from 9. 6 to 10. 4 gm. per cent. This may be termed the renal threshold for proteinuria. Repeat experiments in the same dog show threshold levels to be practically identical. An interval of days (4 to 26 days) has been noted between the start of plasma protein injections and the appearance of the proteinuria. Larger doses of plasma shorten this interval and the critical plasma protein level is attained sooner. Considerable amounts of protein may appear in the urine— 298 <b>gm.</b> <b>protein</b> during a 52 day period in one instance studied—yet the urine clears in 1 to 4 days after cessation of protein injections. Autopsy shows undamaged kidneys. Maximal levels of plasma protein concentration range from 10. 0 to 11. 5 gm. per cent. The highest levels are usually associated with maximal output of protein in the urine.

40|$|N THE PRECEDING PAPER (1), it was {{observed}} that the ratio of sulfur to protein in human serum varied widely in health and disease. This was shown to be {{due to the fact that}} the various protein fractions of serum contained different amounts of sulfur. The total sulfur value of serum depended, therefore, upon the relative amounts of these various protein fractions present in human serum. In order to evaluate the significance of the variation in sulfur con-tent found in abnormal serum protein components, it was first neces-sary to establish a set of normal values for the distribution of sulfur in the protein fractions of serum obtained from the healthy adult. To achieve this end, paper electrophoresis was performed on sera obtained from 16 healthy adults. The patterns were then drawn through the X-ray spectrometer, at constant speed, to determine the sulfur content of the various protein fractions in a manner described before (1). The patterns were then stained and the protein distribu-tion determined. The total sulfur in the serum was determined with the X-ray spectrometer as described (1).

Plaques on RK 13 cells induced by the gM-negative KyA were reduced in size by 80 %, but plaque sizes were restored to wild-type levels on gM-expressing cells. Electron microscopic studies revealed a massive defect in virus release after the deletion of gM in the gE- and gI-negative KyA, which {{was caused by a}} block in secondary envelopment of virions at Golgi vesicles. Recombinant KyA expressing mutant gM with deletions of predicted transmembrane domains was generated and characterized. It was shown that mutant gM was expressed and formed dimeric and oligomeric structures. However, subcellular localization of mutant <b>gM</b> <b>proteins</b> differed from that of wild-type gM. Mutant glycoproteins were not transported to the Golgi network and consequently were not incorporated into the envelope of extracellular virions. Also, a small plaque phenotype of mutant viruses that was indistinguishable from that of the gM-negative KyA was observed.

Proteins with apparent M(r) s of 46, 000 to 48, 000 and 50, 000 to 55, 000 were detected in TCgM cells with specific anti-gM antibodies, and the <b>gM</b> <b>protein</b> pattern was indistinguishable from that in cells infected with EHV- 1 strain RacL 11. A viral mutant (L 11 deltagM) bearing an Escherichia coli lacZ gene inserted into the EHV- 1 strain RacL 11 gM gene (open reading frame 52) was purified, and cells infected with L 11 deltagM did not contain detectable gM.

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of invasive aspergillosis (IA) {{based on the}} detection of Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) {{is complicated by the}} presence of cross-reactive GM epitopes in patient specimens. We have developed a novel and specific Aspergillus antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) by the selection of two well-characterized monoclonal antibodies from 17 candidate antibodies. The epitopes recognized by the monoclonal antibodies were present on the cell walls of the hyphae and the conidia of Aspergillus species, which were circulating or excreted as immunodominant antigens during the acute phase of IA established in the animal models. The detection of experimental Aspergillus-mediated antigenemia was suitably sensitive, and the sensitivity was comparable to that of a commercial GM detection ELISA kit (the Platelia Aspergillus assay). Moreover, the specificity of this assay was 100 % when it was used to test 382 serum specimens and 120 urine specimens from healthy individuals. Cross-reactivity with other common opportunistic fungi, such as Penicillium and Candida species, and with purified <b>GM</b> <b>protein</b> derived from Aspergillus was not evident. Therefore, the chemical nature of the epitopes captured in this assay is most likely not associated with the GM structure, indicating that this newly developed Aspergillus antigen-capture ELISA is a promising tool for the {{diagnosis of}} IA without the risk of the false-positive results that are problematic with current GM antigen assays.

Although some characteristics of fluorescence dequenching were consistent with those observed in other cell-free assays, we have now demonstrated that increased fluorescence was due to leakage of an intralysosomal lipid-transfer protein. This protein was purified and {{found to be a}} 22 kDa molecule with sequence, immunological and functional characteristics strongly suggesting that it is the rat homologue of human <b>GM</b> 2 -activator <b>protein.</b> Both the 22 kDa protein and recombinant human <b>GM</b> 2 -activator <b>protein</b> caused fluorescence dequenching either when mixed with octadecylrhodamine-loaded endosomes and lysosomal membranes or in a liposome system.

Antibodies to the 22 kDa protein added to cell-free endosome-lysosome content-mixing assays had no effect, although they could inhibit fluorescence dequenching caused by the protein. Thus this protein is not required in any fusion event involved in delivery of ligands from endosomes to lysosomes. The existence within an intracellular organelle of a protein capable of acting as an octadecylrhodamine-transfer protein suggests the need for caution in the interpretation of fluorescence-dequenching assays using mammalian subcellular fractions...|$|R

Additionally, <b>gM</b> <b>proteins</b> have been shown to inhibit cell–cell fusion in transfection-based assays by an as yet unclear mechanism. Here, the effect of pseudorabies virus (PRV) gM and the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) gM/UL 49 A complex on the fusion events caused by the HSV- 1 glycoproteins gB, gD, gH and gL was investigated. Fusion of cells expressing HSV- 1 gB, gD, gH and gL was efficiently inhibited by both PRV gM and HSV- 1 gM/UL 49 A. Furthermore, expression of PRV gM or HSV- 1 gM/UL 49 A, which are themselves localized to the TGN, caused both gD and gH/L to be relocalized from the plasma membrane to a juxtanuclear compartment, suggesting that fusion inhibition is caused by the removal of ‘fusion’ proteins from the cell surface. The ability of gM to cause the relocalization of plasma membrane proteins was not restricted to HSV- 1 glycoproteins, as other viral and non-viral proteins were also affected. These data suggest that herpesvirus gM (gM/N) can alter the membrane trafficking itineraries of a broad range of proteins and this may have multiple functions...|$|R

40|$|When {{blood plasma}} {{proteins}} are depleted by bleeding and {{return of the}} washed red cells (plasmapheresis) the regeneration of new plasma proteins can be controlled at will by diet. The amount and character of protein intake is all important. Liver protein and casein are efficient proteins to promote rapid regeneration of plasma proteins but some vegetable proteins are also efficient. The blood plasma proteins are reduced by plasmapheresis close to the edema level (3. 5 – 4. 0 per cent) and kept at this level by suitable exchanges almost daily. The amount of plasma protein removed is credited to the given diet period. A basal ration is used which is poor in vegetable protein (potato) and contains no animal protein. The dog on this ration can be kept in nitrogen balance but can produce only about 2 gm. plasma protein per kilo body weight per week. With liver or casein feeding this production can be increased three- or fourfold. A reserve of protein building material can be demonstrated in the normal dog when its plasma proteins are depleted. In the first 3 weeks of depletion this reserve {{in excess of the}} final basal output may amount to 3 – 20 <b>gm.</b> <b>protein.</b> This may be stored at least in part in the liver. As much as 50 per cent of this reserve may be albumin or albumin producing material. A reversal of the albumin-globulin ratio may be observed on the basal diet alone.

The levels of intact peanut protein and/or DRP-Ara h 2 in human serum, saliva, and breast milk were monitored using a competitive inhibition ELISA with {{a limit of}} quantitation (LOQ) of 100 ng DRP-Ara h 2 /ml body fluid. ^ The first study monitored levels of both intact peanut protein and DRP-Ara h 2 in serum and saliva of 10 healthy, non-allergic subjects who consumed capsules containing 25 gm of roasted peanut flour (12. 75 <b>gm</b> <b>protein).</b> Levels of intact peanut proteins and DRP-Ara h 2 were measured over 24 hours in serum and saliva using a commercial peanut ELISA and an optimized competitive inhibition ELISA, respectively. Intact peanut protein was not found in sera or saliva {{over the course of}} the study whereas DRP-Ara h 2 was detected in both body fluids. Peak levels of 248 ng DRP-Ara h 2 /ml of serum and 4890 ng/ml of saliva were detected over the time course of this study. Demonstration of the stability and distribution of digestion-resistant peanut allergens in human body fluids over an extended period of time may provide insight into potential risks posed by exposure to allergenic proteins in saliva. ^ The second study monitored the levels of intact peanut protein and DRP-Ara h 2 in breast milk taken at baseline and 7 days after the start of a low-allergen or control diet. Thirty-eight subjects (20 low-allergen diets and 18 control diets) were included in the study. No intact peanut proteins were detected in samples at baseline or on Day 7. An average of 1050 ng DRP-Ara h 2 /ml breast milk was detected in 35 of 38 subjects at baseline. DRP-Ara h 2 was detected in all breast milk samples on Day 7 from subjects on the low-allergen diet. DRP-Ara h 2 present in breast milk could lead to sensitization of exclusively breastfed infants. ...|$|E

40|$|Lysosomal {{degradation}} of ganglioside GM 2 by hexosaminidase A requires {{the presence of}} a small, non-enzymatic cofactor, the <b>GM</b> 2 -activator <b>protein</b> (<b>GM</b> 2 AP). Lack of functional protein leads to the AB variant of GM 2 -gangliosidosis, a fatal lysosomal storage disease. Although its possible mode of action and functional domains have been discussed frequently in the past, no structural information about GM 2 AP is available so far. Here, we determine the complete disulfide bond pattern of the protein. Two of the four disulfide bonds present in the protein were open to classical determination by enzymatic cleavage and mass spectrometry. The direct localization of the remaining two bonds was impeded by the close vicinity of cysteines 136 and 138. We determined the arrangement of these disulfide bonds by MALDI-PSD analysis of disulfide linked peptides and by partial reduction, cyanylation and fragmentation in basic solution, as described recently (Wu F, Watson JT, 1997, Protein Sci 6 : 391 - 398) ...|$|R
40|$|When {{the protein}} {{consumption}} of normal human individuals is increased from 0. 5, to 1. 5, to 2. 5 <b>gm.</b> of <b>protein</b> per kilo body weight, the specific {{gravity of the}} plasma rises and the hematocrit value falls. The analysis of variance demonstrates that the change in protein consumption is a significant but minor factor in determining the total variability of the observations. When albino rats were given diets containing a small, a moderate, and {{a large amount of}} protein, there was an increase in serum protein concentration but no change in hematocrit value. During the period over which the most rapid changes in rate of urea excretion and serum urea concentration occurred as normal human individuals passed from a 2. 5 to an 0. 1 <b>gm.</b> of <b>protein</b> per kilo body weight consumption, there was no change in serum protein concentration. Over a 5 day period during which a diet that was adequate in calories but almost wholly devoid of protein was taken, the serum protein concentration of normal individuals steadily rose. This was associated with a slight increase in hematocrit value but no change in blood or plasma volume. The protein effect is one of the minor factors that contribute to the variability of serum protein and hematocrit measurements in normal individuals. The general conclusion is reached that we shall have to measure the rate at which red cells and protein enter and leave the circulating blood stream before we can hope to comprehend the mechanism of the protein effect...|$|R
40|$|The Golgi {{apparatus}} {{has long}} been suggested to be important for directing secretion to specific sites on the plasma membrane in response to extracellular signaling events. However, the mechanisms by which signaling events are coordinated with Golgi apparatus function remain poorly understood. Here, we identify a scaffolding function for the Golgi matrix <b>protein</b> <b>GM</b> 130 that sheds light on how such signaling events may be regulated. We show that the mammalian Ste 20 kinases YSK 1 and MST 4 target to the Golgi apparatus via the Golgi matrix <b>protein</b> <b>GM</b> 130. In addition, GM 130 binding activates these kinases by promoting autophosphorylation of a conserved threonine within the T-loop. Interference with YSK 1 function perturbs perinuclear Golgi organization, cell migration, and invasion into type I collagen. A biochemical screen identifies 14 - 3 - 3 ζ as a specific substrate for YSK 1 that localizes to the Golgi apparatus, and potentially links YSK 1 signaling at the Golgi apparatus with protein transport events, cell adhesion, and polarity complexes important for cell migration...|$|R

50|$|In pregnancies {{of greater}} than 30 weeks, the fetal lung {{maturity}} may be tested by sampling {{the amount of}} surfactant in the amniotic fluid by amniocentesis, wherein a needle is inserted through the mother's abdomen and uterus. Several tests are available that correlate with the production of surfactant. These include the lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio ("L/S ratio"), the presence of phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and more recently, the surfactant/albumin (S/A) ratio. For the L/S ratio, if the result is less than 2:1, the fetal lungs may be surfactant deficient. The presence of PG usually indicates fetal lung maturity. For the S/A ratio, the result is given as mg of surfactant per <b>gm</b> of <b>protein.</b> An S/A ratio <35 indicates immature lungs, between 35-55 is indeterminate, and >55 indicates mature surfactant production(correlates with an L/S ratio of 2.2 or greater).|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe <b>GM</b> 2 {{activator}} <b>protein</b> (<b>GM</b> 2 AP) is {{an accessory}} protein {{required for the}} enzymatic conversion of GM 2 to GM 3  by hydrolases in the lysosomal compartments of cells. Here, GM 2 AP interactions with lipid vesicles are investigated by sucrose-loaded vesicle sedimentation and gel filtration assays, {{and the effects of}} pH and lipid composition on membrane binding and lipid extraction are characterized. The sedimentation experiments allow for facile quantification of the percentage of protein in solution and on the bilayer surface, with detailed analysis of the protein:lipid complex that remains in solution. Optimum binding and ligand extraction is found for pH 4. 8 where < 15 % of the protein remains surface associated regardless of the lipid composition. In addition to extracting GM 2, we find that GM 2 AP readily extracts dansyl-headgroup-labeled lipids as well as other phospholipids from vesicles. The ability of GM 2 AP to extract dansyl-DHPE from vesicles is altered by pH and the specific ligand GM 2. Although the unique endosomal lipid, bis(monoacylglycero) phosphate, is not required for ligand extraction, it does enhance the extraction efficiency of GM 2 when cholesterol is present in the vesicles...|$|R
