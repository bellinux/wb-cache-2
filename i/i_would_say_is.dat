2500|$|Rowling has said, [...] "I've taken horrible liberties with {{folklore}} and mythology, but I'm quite unashamed about that, because British {{folklore and}} British mythology {{is a totally}} bastard mythology.

When {{asked about}} the Prime Minister's idea she sounded lukewarm, saying the real {{question}} was: [...] "How do you trigger the right response in people? Because lecturing people, bashing them on the head - on the whole, we know - doesn't get us there". Kirsty Young, the presenter, suggested that Black was [...] "somebody who might think that a simplistic political soundbite isn't even beginning to address the underlying issues of, culturally, what we're finding such a problem right now". Black replied: [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> {{that this is a}} hugely complex problem and not one thing alone will ever solve it".|$|E
2500|$|SCO {{executives}} Darl McBride and Blake Stowell also denigrated Jones, {{and claimed}} that she worked for IBM. Jones denied this allegation, as did IBM in a court filing. During an SCO conference call on April 13, 2005, McBride said, [...] "The reality is the web site is full of misinformation, including {{the people who are}} actually running it" [...] when talking about Groklaw, adding also [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> that it is not what it is purported to be". Later developments in the court cases showed that McBride's statements to the press regarding the SCO litigation had limited credibility; very few such statements were ever substantiated and most were shown to be false. For example, McBride claimed that SCO owned the copyrights to UNIX, and SCO filed suit to try to enforce these claims. The outcome went against McBride's claims. The jury found that SCO had not purchased these copyrights.|$|E
2500|$|On October 17, 2008, Bachmann gave an {{interview}} on MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews {{in support of the}} presidential campaign of Senator John McCain that brought the Minnesota 6th Congressional District race national attention. During the interview she criticized Barack Obama for his association with Jeremiah Wright and Bill Ayers, saying [...] "...usually we associate with people who have similar ideas to us, and it seems that it calls into question what Barack Obama's true beliefs, and values, and thoughts are... I am very concerned that he [...] may have anti-American views." [...] She noted the bombing campaign orchestrated by Bill Ayers before discussing his association with Barack Obama, arguing that [...] "Bill Ayers is not someone the average American wants to see their president have an association with." [...] Matthews followed up by asking [...] "But he [...] is a Senator from the State of Illinois; he's {{one of the members of}} Congress you suspect of being anti-American. How many people in the Congress of the United States do you think are anti-American? You've already suspected Barack Obama, is he alone or are there others?" [...] Bachmann answered, [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> that the news media should do a penetrating exposé and take a look... I wish they would... I wish the American media would take a great look at the views of the people in Congress and find out are they pro-America, or anti-America.

6000|$|... "What <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> this," [...] resumed the trapper, who was {{far from}} {{understanding}} all the subtle distinctions with which his more learned companion so often saw fit to embellish his discourse; [...] "there is but one birth and one death to all things, be it hound, or be it deer; be it red skin, or be it white. Both {{are in the hands}} of the Lord, it being as unlawful for man to strive to hasten the one, as impossible to prevent the other. But I will not say that something may not be done to put the last moment aside, for a while at least, and therefore it is a question, that any one has a right to put to his own wisdom, how far he will go, and how much pain he will suffer, to lengthen out a time that may have been too long already. Many a dreary winter and scorching summer has gone by since I have turned, to the right hand or to the left, to add an hour to a life that has already stretched beyond fourscore years. I keep myself as ready to answer to my name as a soldier at evening roll-call. In my judgment, if your cases are left to Indian tempers, the policy of the Great Sioux will lead his people to sacrifice you all; nor do I put much dependence on his seeming love for me; therefore it becomes a question whether you are ready for such a journey; and if, being ready, whether this is not as good a time to start as another. Should my opinion be asked, thus far will I give it in your favour; that is to say, it is my belief your life has been innocent enough, touching any great offences that you may have committed, though honesty compels me to add, that I think all you can lay claim to, on the score of activity in deeds, will not amount to any thing worth naming in the great account." ...|$|E
60|$|I would not, therefore, {{be thought}} to disesteem or dissuade {{the study of}} NATURE. I readily agree the contemplation of his works gives us {{occasion}} to admire, revere, and glorify their Author: and, if rightly directed, may be of greater benefit to mankind than the monuments of exemplary charity that have at so great charge been raised by the founders of hospitals and almshouses. He that first invented printing, discovered {{the use of the}} compass, or made public the virtue and right use of KIN KINA, did more for the propagation of knowledge, for the supply and increase of useful commodities, and saved more from the grave than those who built colleges, workhouses, and hospitals. All that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>is,</b> that we should not be too forwardly possessed with the opinion or expectation of knowledge, where it is not to be had, or by ways that will not attain to it: that we should not take doubtful systems for complete sciences; nor unintelligible notions for scientifical demonstrations. In the knowledge of bodies, we must be content to glean what we can from particular experiments: since we cannot, from a discovery of their real essences, grasp at a time whole sheaves, and in bundles comprehend the nature and properties of whole species together. Where our inquiry is concerning co-existence, or repugnancy to co-exist, which by contemplation of our ideas we cannot discover; there experience, observation, and natural history, must give us, by our senses and by retail, an insight into corporeal substances. The knowledge of BODIES we must get by our senses, warily employed in taking notice of their qualities and operations on one another: and what we hope to know of SEPARATE SPIRITS in this world, we must, I think, expect only from revelation. He that shall consider how little general maxims, precarious principles, and hypotheses laid down at pleasure, have promoted true knowledge, or helped to satisfy the inquiries of rational men after real improvements; how little, I say, the setting out at that end has, for many ages together, advanced men's progress, towards the knowledge of natural philosophy, Will think we have reason to thank those who in this latter age have taken another course, and have trod out to us, though not an easier way to learned ignorance, yet a surer way to profitable knowledge.|$|E
