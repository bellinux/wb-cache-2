5|$|Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand {{presents}} {{a detailed analysis}} and refutation of climate change denial. In her foreword to the book, Naomi Oreskes writes that people fall victim to the phenomenon of denial due to feeling frightened. The book examines several arguments against global warming, and uses peer-reviewed evidence from the scientific consensus to back-up rationale for disputing the validity of each argument. The methodology of those denying climate change is assessed, including: cherry picking data purporting to support their specific viewpoints, maintaining a high bar <b>for</b> <b>evidence</b> of climate change by those denying it, and criticism {{of the values of}} climate scientists themselves. The book puts forth an explanation why certain individuals, and the wider public, have a tendency to deny the scientific consensus for climate change.|$|E

Graves points out that {{there is little evidence that}} habitat loss has played a role. It is noted that this swallow is not affected by being near human disturbance. Graves also added that the swallows adapted to nesting in man-made structures. In general, this swallow is not affected by being near human disturbance. It is proposed that nest boxes be used to counter habitat loss and predation.|$|E
