40|$|Aim: Echinococcosis or {{hydatidosis}} (due to the {{larval stage}} of Echinococcus spp.) and cysticercosis (due to the larval stage of Taenia hydatigena) pose a significant economic losses due to slaughter condemnation and risk {{to public health}} in developing countries such as Tanzania where sanitation is poor and people live in close proximity {{with each other and}} with animals. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of and to identify the predisposing factors for echinococcosis and cysticercosis in sheep and goats at three slaughter slabs located in the livestock-wildlife interface areas of Ngorongoro, Tanzania. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional based survey was conducted, from January 2013 to April 2013, whereby a total of 180 animals comprising 90 goats and 90 sheep of both sexes were examined at postmortem for the evidence of larval stages of Echinococcus spp. (hydatid cyst) and T. hydatigena (Cysticercus tenuicollis) through visual inspection, <b>incision</b> and palpation <b>of</b> <b>organs</b> and viscera.

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{study was conducted}} from October 2010 to May 2012 {{with the aim of}} investigating prevalence, associated risk factors and characterization of hydatidosis in domestic ruminants slaughtered for human consumption, in four selected abattoirs of central Oromia, namely Akaki, Ambo, Assela and Bishoftu. Regular visits to the abattoirs were made and a thorough examination <b>of</b> the vis-ceral <b>organs</b> (liver, lung, heart, spleen, kidney and other tissues) were done by inspection, palpation and <b>incision</b> <b>of</b> each <b>organs.</b> The number, size of cysts and the organ from which the cyst recovered were also recorded. Samples of hydatid cysts were collected in a plastic bags for examination in the nearest veterinary clinic laboratory. Out of 770 camels, 2910 cattle, 20059 goats and 6680 sheep inspected for the presence of hydatid cysts, 74 (61. 6 %), 1896 (65. 15 %), 26 (0. 13 %) and 611 (9. 15 %) were found to be harboring hydatid cysts, respectively. Small, calcified and sterile hydatid cysts were found in agglomeration in the liver than other organs, while fertile and viable of medium and large cysts were most frequently observed in the lungs, spleen and abdominal cavity. Among the accessible offals to the de-finitive host, the lungs were found to be major contaminant viscera while the rest follow the pathway. In terms of frequency, size and fertility of the hydatid cysts, the lung was found to be the predilection site in cattle, sheep and goats, while liver in camels. This study revealed a high prevalence of hydatidosis in slaughtered domestic ruminants and thus the parasite requires serious veterinary attentions in the study area...|$|R

40|$|An {{approach}} to the detection of pyrimidine dimer-DNA glycosylase activity in living cells is presented. Mutants of Escherichia coli defective in uvr functions required for <b>incision</b> <b>of</b> UV-irradiated DNA were infected with phage T 4 denV+ or denV- (defective in the T 4 pyrimidine dimer-DNA glycosylase activity). In the former case the denV gene product catalyzed the <b>incision</b> <b>of</b> UV-irradiated host DNA, facilitating the subsequent excision of thymine-containing pyrimidine dimers. Isolation of these dimers from the acid-soluble fraction of infected cells was achieved by a multistep thin-layer chromatographic system. Exposure of the dimers to irradiation that monomerizes pyrimidine dimers (direct photoreversal) resulted in the stoichiometric formation of free thymine. Thus, in vivo <b>incision</b> <b>of</b> UV-irradiated DNA dependent on a pyrimidine dimer-DNA glycosylase can be demonstrated...|$|R

3000|$|Several {{modifications}} of the RP-technique {{were described as}} an effort to preserve as many nerve fibers as possible. All reported separately about superior functional results. Montorsi et al. proposed the <b>incision</b> <b>of</b> levator and prostatic fasciae high ventrally at prostate apex (Montorsi et al. 2005). While, Graefen et al. recommended the high <b>incision</b> <b>of</b> periprostatic fascia up to the ventral aspect of the prostate (Graefen et al. 2006.) Savera et al. reported improved potency outcomes after performance of the [...] "Veil of Aphrodite" [...] technique preserving the ventrolateral periprostatic fascia (Menon et al. 2007; Savera et al. 2006). Moreover, Nielsen et al. observed higher potency rates in patients who underwent high anterior <b>incision</b> <b>of</b> the prostatic fascia. Our contribution to the refinement of RP-technique includes preservation of all pelvic fasciae surrounding the prostate as well as puboprostatic ligaments. This results in superior preservation of NVBs and was accompanied with comparable perioperative outcomes compared to the mentioned recent {{modifications of}} RP-techniques (Khoder et al. 2011).|$|R

40|$|Endoscopic {{incision}} is a {{good management}} option for orthotopic ureterocele. But most of the literature has shown its efficacy only in children. We have done this retrospective study to evaluate the safety and efficacy <b>of</b> endoscopic <b>incision</b> <b>of</b> orthotopic ureterocele in adults. From March 2004 to January 2008, at our center, 26 adults underwent transurethral, transverse <b>incision</b> <b>of</b> an ureterocele. The perioperative data of these patients were retrospectively analyzed. The literature was reviewed to identify all the reported options for management of this relatively rare condition in adults. Unilateral ureterocele was present in 24 patients and two patients had bilateral ureterocele. One patient had associated upper tract stones. Three patients had associated stones in ureterocele. Transurethral, transverse <b>incision</b> <b>of</b> ureterocele was given in all patients. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 50. 5 h. Twenty-three patients were available for follow-up at three, six and 12 months. All patients were symptom free. At three months ultrasound and intravenous urography revealed no residual ureterocele but four patients showed residual hydronephrosis, but with {{a decrease in the}} grade indicating decompression. Micturating cystourethrography revealed vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) in two patients and the reflux persisted in one patient even at 6 months. We conclude that in adults, management with endoscopic <b>incision</b> <b>of</b> orthotopic ureterocele is safe and effective. VUR may occur in a few cases...|$|R
40|$|During surgery, <b>incision</b> <b>of</b> {{the skin}} under aseptic {{conditions}} is performed. Despite {{the absence of}} noxious agents, an inflammatory response may be induced. We studied the local inflammatory response in human skin {{as a result of}} surgical intervention, under aseptic conditions. Elective standardized vascular surgery served as a model. A series of skin biopsies was taken from the wound edge at different time points after first incision. Biopsies, directly taken at first incision were considered to represent normal skin. Additional biopsies were taken at 30 min after the start of surgery and just before closure of the wound, maximally 270 min after surgery. Kinetics of recruitment of cells, expression of adhesion molecules and the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines was studied. Granulocytes were observed at first at 30 min after <b>incision</b> <b>of</b> the skin and their number increased in time. This granulocyte infiltration is paralleled by E-selectin expression on endothelial eels, which also was observed at first at 30 min after surgery with a further increase in number in time. <b>Incision</b> <b>of</b> the skin did not change P-selectin, ICAM- 1, VCAM- 1, TNF alpha, IL 1 alpha, IL 1 beta, IL 6 and IL 8 expression. These results show that <b>incision</b> <b>of</b> the skin under aseptic conditions during elective standardized vascular surgery induces local nonspecific cellular inflammation...|$|R

40|$|<b>Incision</b> <b>of</b> damaged DNA by the Escherichia coli UvrABC {{endonuclease}} {{requires the}} UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC proteins {{as well as}} ATP hydrolysis. This incision reaction {{can be divided into}} three steps: site recognition, preincision complex formation, and incision. UvrAB is able to execute the first two steps in the reaction while the addition of UvrC is required for the <b>incision</b> <b>of</b> DNA. This <b>incision</b> reaction does not require ATP hydrolysis and results in the formation of a tight UvrABC post-incision complex and the generation of an oligomer of approximately 12 nucleotides. At high UvrABC concentrations the specificity <b>of</b> the <b>incision</b> for damaged DNA is decreased and significant <b>incision</b> <b>of</b> undamaged DNA occurs. Analogous to damage specific <b>incision,</b> this type <b>of</b> <b>incision</b> leads to generation of an oligonucleotide, but in this case the size is approximately 9 nucleotides in length. Further evidence shows that the combination of UvrB and UvrC proteins can generate a significant amount of a similar size product on undamaged DNA. In addition, the UvrC protein alone can generate a small amount of the same product. Immunological characterization of the weak nuclease activity seen with UvrC indicates that the activity is very tightly associated with the purified UvrC protein...|$|R
