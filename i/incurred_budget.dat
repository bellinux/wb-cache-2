30|$|In {{light of}} the {{problems}} pertaining to AECL, the Federal Government wants to enhance its nuclear credibility. Gary Lunn, Natural Resources Minister at the time, {{said that it is}} “imperative” that Ontario purchase new reactors from AECL (Geddes, 2007). Although Harper’s government comprehends the importance of AECL as a federal Crown corporation, it does not completely support AECL’s efforts to regain its previous reputation. Harper’s government has declared that in order to fulfill the country’s growing electricity demands and facilitate the development of Canadian nuclear technology, the government has to decide about AECL’s current status. The Conservatives are looking at different business models for AECL, including the sale of ownership stocks to one of several companies that have expressed interest, such as Westinghouse Electric Co. and France’s Areva, foreign companies, and Bruce Power Inc., a Canadian company. Natural Resources Minister Lunn said that AECL’s status is under review, stating that they are considering all options, from the status quo to a partnership with private investors to a sale to a foreign government. Another incentive for the Federal Government to change the status of AECL is the reliance of AECL’s development program on federal tax dollars. Since, as mentioned above, AECL has <b>incurred</b> <b>budget</b> overruns, the sale of its stocks to a private company could alleviate taxpayers’ criticisms of the Federal Government. On the other hand, industry observers say the lawsuit pertaining to the MAPLE reactors will {{make it more difficult for}} Ottawa to find a private suitor for AECL. This increases the probability that the government will opt to sell AECL to a foreign company or government (Hamilton, 2008 b; Puxley, 2007). However, AECL does not want to be privatized. Its spokesman, Dale Coffin, disputed suggestions that AECL needs a strategic private-sector partner to compete in the world.|$|E
50|$|Under {{pressure}} from its Liberal allies {{as well as}} the Conservative opposition, the Labour government appointed a committee to review the state of public finances. The May Report of July 1931 urged public sector wage cuts and large cuts in public spending (notably in benefit payments ("dole") to the unemployed) to avoid <b>incurring</b> a <b>budget</b> deficit. The sense was that the deficit was dangerous and had to be reduced; the proposal was to meet £24 million by increased taxes on the rich, and £96 million by economies, of which £64 million would come from unemployment relief. This proposal proved deeply unpopular within the Labour Party and among its main supporters, the trade unions, which along with several government ministers refused to support any such measures. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Snowden, insisted that the Report's recommendations be adopted to avoid <b>incurring</b> a <b>budget</b> deficit.|$|R

For some groups, ERA caused employment and earnings to increase more {{than they would have}} without the programme—in some cases, by a great deal—and it also yielded some positive cost-benefit results, both for participants and the Treasury. But for other groups, ERA did not improve participants’ economic outcomes, and the government’s <b>budget</b> <b>incurred</b> a net loss.|$|R
50|$|Club {{speakers}} {{often use}} the platform {{to put forth}} their agendas to members and the media. On December 14, 1962 then-President John F. Kennedy made his famous remarks calling for a sharp cut in tax rates and reform of the tax system in order to grow the economy. In part, he said:In short, it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise the revenues {{in the long run}} is to cut the rates now. The experience of a number of European countries and Japan have borne this out. This country's own experience with tax reduction in 1954 has borne this out. And the reason is that only full employment can balance the budget, and tax reduction can pave the way to that employment. The purpose of cutting taxes now is not to <b>incur</b> a <b>budget</b> deficit, but to achieve the more prosperous, expanding economy which can bring a budget surplus.|$|R
40|$|Introduction The past 25 {{years have}} seen major {{advances}} in software engineering. The power, sophistication {{and ease of use}} of systems are constantly increasing. Systems that {{only a few years ago}} presented a major challenge are now developed as a matter of routine. Improvement of the overall process of software development has, however, proved slow and difficult, both in comparison to hardware and when judged against market hopes and expectations. Software development organisations are often disappointed with the benefit obtained from new methods and tools. Products still suffer major quality problems. Projects <b>incur</b> serious <b>budget</b> and time overruns, if indeed they manage to deliver at all. There are still too many failures the world over.

However, by 1963 the College {{administration}} was confronted with mounting financial difficulties due to rising operating costs, direct competition from a new community college, and persistent rumors of a possible state takeover. That year the College issued The Fenn Plan for Unified Higher Education in Cleveland-Northeastern Ohio [...] calling upon the State of Ohio to develop a state university in Cleveland using Fenn College as its nucleus. During the 1962 Ohio gubernatorial campaign candidate James Rhodes had proposed {{that there should be}} a state university within a 30-mile radius of every citizen. At that time the nearest state university to Cleveland was Kent State University in Kent, Ohio. On 18 December 1964, Governor Rhodes signed Ohio General Assembly Amended House Bill No. 2 creating Ohio's seventh state university, Cleveland State University and announced the appointment of a board of trustees. On March 10, 1965 the Fenn College and CSU Trustees reached an agreement incorporating Fenn as the nucleus of the new university on September 1, 1965.|$|R

50|$|Prior to the Civil War, the United States faced a {{financial}} depression {{subsequent to the}} Panic of 1857, an event facilitated by over-expansion of the domestic economy and a European financial meltdown. In the three years preceding the Civil War, the Federal Government <b>incurred</b> a <b>budget</b> deficit exceeding $40 million. Coupled {{with the threat of}} secession, the Federal deficit placed the US government under considerable financial strain. In 1860, the US Treasury paid between 8 and 12 percent interest on government bonds in order to raise additional funds and meet public expenditures. In December 1861, the US Treasury attempted to sell five millions of interest-bearing notes at 12 percent but found itself able to dispose of only four millions. The Treasury's struggles illustrate the precarious nature of the US government's financial state. As the nation edged closer to war, the need to mobilize a volunteer force placed an additional financial burden upon the Federal government. While treasury notes with enticing interest rates allowed the US government to raise revenue quickly, they also established a need for additional revenue streams with which to pay off interest.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Post-fabrication tuning {{provides}} a promising design approach {{to mitigate the}} performance and power overheads of process variation in advanced fabrication technologies. This paper explores design considerations and VLSI-CAD support for a recently proposed postfabrication tuning knob called voltage interpolation. The paper discusses design tradeoffs between circuit tuning range and static power overheads that can be performed within the synthesis flow of the design process. The paper explores the scheme for a 64 -core chip-multiprocessor machine using industrial-grade design blocks and shows that the scheme {{can be used to}} mitigate overhead arising from random and correlated within-die process variations. The analysis shows that the scheme can match the nominal delay target with a 10 % power cost, or for the same power <b>budget,</b> <b>incur</b> only a 9 % delay overhead after variations. I...|$|R
40|$|Linear {{projects}} with repetitive activity in units are considered for investigation, and a two-stage profit optimization model for linear scheduling problems using constraint programming (CP) is proposed. To maintain work continuity for repetitive activities, interruption time and crew availability are addressed, and the optimization process {{is presented as}} follows: (1) optimizing the primary objective (project profit); (2) minimizing total interruption time, given the optimized value of the primary objective. Repetitive activities <b>incur</b> batches of <b>budget</b> expenditure according to activity implementation time. Cash flow and financial elements are therefore integrated into the optimization model. Owing to flexible CP techniques, contractors' requirements, such as credit limit and payment conditions, can be integrated simply into the model formulation for practical use. Lastly, a bridge example is adopted, with various constraints such as duration limitation, for scenario analysis. Consequently, the two-stage optimization process optimizes project profit, and also maximizes work continuity for linear scheduling problems.

H 577 P LMS 2015 Jiangxi, 111 pages :illustrationsIn the {{manufacturing}} industry, the production output is constrained {{due to the}} limited capital flow. It is a fatal weakness to the manufacturer {{as well as to}} component suppliers. When component suppliers <b>incur</b> <b>budget</b> constraints, the manufacturer can share a proportion of each supplier's production cost to relieve her from such restraint. We intend to study the manufacturer's optimal solution of the cost share amounts and analyze how such sharing will affect the suppliers' performances. Since it involves multiple suppliers, we will further explore how different decision sequences will affect the equilibrium. On the other hand, when two competing manufacturers (or firms) incur capacity constraints in the demand market, they have to make the decisions on the capacity investment. Therefore, we propose two types of model in this thesis to study the above problems. In the first model, we consider one manufacturer who sources multiple complementary components, each from one independent supplier who has the budget constraint. Facing with the uncertain demand, the manufacturer decides on the cost share amounts given to his suppliers. We analyze three different decision sequences in this model: a) simple sequential decisions in wholesale prices, b) simultaneous decisions in wholesale prices and c) hybrid sequential decision in alternating cost share amounts and wholesale prices. Compare first two sequences, we find that the manufacturer strictly prefers the simultaneous setting. On the contrary, the supplier who makes the decision first in the simple sequential setting gets worse in the simultaneous decision sequence. We then study the manufacturer's optimal solutions in the hybrid sequential decision setting. Different from the simple sequential setting, the equilibrium is asymmetric in hybrid setting. Furthermore, the supplier who decides first also charges a higher wholesale price than other suppliers which underlines our exploration that early action boosts the supplier's bargaining power no matter whether the manufacturer shares the cost or not. In the second model, we consider a setting of two firms serving one market whose demand is price sensitive and uncertain. We characterize the equilibrium capacity and production decisions by the two firms. The result shows that the firm whose process efficiency is more prone to improving as capacity expands will invest in more capacity and achieve a more efficient process given that production is not overly labor and material intensive. To the best of our knowledge, this is the initial research to study cost sharing in a multiple-suppliers model with three decision sequences, especially with the new hybrid decision setting. While the cost sharing is always beneficial to the manufacturer, we surprisingly find that the supplier who charges the highest wholesale price is averse it even if her cost burden is loosed after cost sharing. We also show the conditions under which cost sharing benefits the suppliers. Furthermore, the result also illustrates that different decision sequences have different impacts on the equilibrium and the resulting channel performance. In the second model, we find out the optimal solution under the circumstance where two firms make the competing decisions on the capacity investment. Department of Logistics and Maritime StudiesPh.

40|$|This work {{describes}} various performance trade-offs {{that arise}} {{from the use of}} a technique for optical switching under various network topologies. Such switching operation can be summarized as follows: (a) user data are divided into fixed-length fragments, (b) each fragment is assigned to a different wavelength, and (c) all wavelengths are simultaneously switched to the egress links. This concept of dividing user data into several wavelengths to be simultaneously switched is called wavelength striping and its purpose is to reduce latency and increase throughput for short distance interconnects. We depart from previous work where a building block implementing this basic switching function has been built around semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs). In this paper, we investigate diverse trade-offs {{that arise from}} the use of this switching approach in different network topologies. One of the main issues addressed in this paper is the relation between cascadability and bit error rate (BER). In this case, our results indicate that a switch fabric can cascade up to five stages without exceeding a BER of 10 − 9 and without <b>incurring</b> in power <b>budget</b> problems. We also show that the performance degradation, introduced by cascading SOAs, can be compensated with a star interconnect architecture that is introduced. Other issues addressed in this paper are the effect of scalability on cost and the effect of latency on TCP performance and reliability...|$|R
40|$|Context: Software {{projects}} frequently <b>incur</b> {{schedule and}} <b>budget</b> overruns. Planning and estimation are particularlychallenging in large and globally distributed projects. While software engineering researchers have beeninvestigating effort estimation {{for many years}} to help practitioners to improve their estimation processes, there is littleresearch about effort estimation in large-scale distributed agile projects. Objective: The main objective of this paper is three-fold: i) to identify how effort estimation is carried out in largescaledistributed agile projects; ii) to analyze the accuracy of the effort estimation processes in large-scale distributedagile projects; and iii) to identify the factors that impact the accuracy of effort estimates in large-scale distributed agileprojects. Method: We performed an exploratory longitudinal case study. The data collection was operationalized througharchival research and semi-structured interviews. Results: The main findings of this study are: 1) underestimation is the dominant trend in the studied case, 2) reestimationat the analysis stage improves the accuracy of the effort estimates, 3) requirements with large size/scopeincur larger effort overruns, 4) immature teams incur larger effort overruns, 5) requirements developed in multi-sitesettings incur larger effort overruns as compared to requirements developed in a collocated setting, and 6) requirementspriorities impact the accuracy of the effort estimates.

40|$|As integrated-circuit device {{dimensions}} decrease, {{the importance}} of having new reliable processes for growing MOS gate oxides becomes more and more evident. Short process times and low process temperatures are desirable features in view of tight thermal budget constraints and the need for precise location of dopants. However, conventional thermal oxidation to grow high quality films usually requires relatively long oxidation times and relatively high temperature. Previous research on negative point (anodic) corona-processed SiO 2 films has shown that the thermal <b>budget</b> <b>incurred</b> using the corona process is much lower than in standard thermal oxidation due to the greatly enhanced oxidation rate. Promising results of low-T corona-processed [Special characters omitted. ] 100 Å films have shown that the films had physical characteristics comparable to those obtained in thermal oxidation. This research extends the previous work: (a) thin oxides ([Special characters omitted. ] 200 Å) are processed in order to be potentially more relevant to modern MOS processes, and (b) a more thorough electrical characterization is initiated. Electrical tests show that oxide and interface charges are comparable to thermal oxides. Breakdown characteristics are promising. The boundary between the corona-processed and control regions is found to be severely compromised. Subsequent corona treatments which overlap such boundary regions are found to restore the quality of the oxide. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy results show that the negative corona films have a different structure from that of thermal oxide films. Electrical tests on positive point (cathodic) corona-processed SiO 2 films show that the electrical quality of the films is much worse than that of standard thermally grown films, grown at a similar temperature. In the interests of growing more-uniform negative-corona SiO 2 films on broader areas of silicon wafers, experiments using multi-point or multi-needle structures were conducted. The enhancement profiles of films grown in both positive and negative cases are simulated using linear-parabolic rate constants, modified to account for the corona curren...|$|R

Furthermore, I focus on the system of financing public universities in the Czech Republic. In the Czech Republic, students are provided with free-of-charge university education, if they complete the graduation examination from the Czech language or if they have another, officially verified, examination from the Czech language. As a result of the mutual agreement between both countries, citizens of the Slovak Republic have an exception negotiated in law 111 / 1998 Coll. about universities. The practical part focuses on calculating the costs to the public budget for the study of Slovak citizens as well as calculating the benefits, if they decide to work in the Czech Republic. The analysis arises from data of the MŠMT (Ministry of Education, Youth and Physical Education) and the ČSÚ (Czech Statistics Bureau) regarding the number of foreigners at universities as well as the system of financing universities from the statistics of the largest Czech universities, which I have obtained. From the collected data, I find out the representation of Slovak citizens in the individual years.
