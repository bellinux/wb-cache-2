40|$|The {{occurrence}} of recrystallization and large ice areas after storage of frozen food products makes {{the use of}} ice-structuring proteins (ISPs) in food products meaningful. Food products are frozen to extend shelf-life during long storage periods while preservation of the overall sensoric quality. Recrystallisation processes alter and, in the worst case, damage {{the structure of the}} food, resulting in an unsightly thawed e. g. cream cake or cream puff product. Freezing and freeze storage behaviour of various food products should be investigated in order to optimize the manufacturing of frozen products and to maintain the product quality with appropriate storage until the consumers usage. We present a study on the influence of ice-structuring proteins, isolated from the sea-ice microalgae Fragilariopsis cylindrus (fcISP), on frozen whipped cream. The individual phases of the <b>frozen</b> <b>cream</b> foam have been detected by cryo-Raman spectroscopy and visualized. The advantage of the unique cryo-Raman spectroscopy system available at the AWI is that the individual components can be detected not only qualitatively, but also localized in the frozen sample. We show that the fat and ice structure in <b>frozen</b> <b>cream,</b> and their temperature-induced changes, are well detectable by cryo-Raman spectroscopy. Furthermore, the effect of fcISPs on the microstructure shows an inhibition of ice recrystallization, leading to smaller grain aggregates and a finer fat distribution than without fcISPs. We therefore suggest that fcISPs are an effective mean in controlling recrystallization processes in frozen goods...|$|E

The theoretical part describes general information about the ice cream, rheological characteristics, the basic raw material for production of frozen creams, evaluation of ice cream and quality requirements of ice cream. In detail are described plant Stevia rebaudiana, its history and origin, botanical classification, medically significant substance, use in food processing and safety of use. In detail are also described dietary fiber, fiber content components, its importance, nutritional recommendations, fiber sources and there are presented some products of dietary fiber. Legislation of creamy ice creams and technology from mix preparation to freezing are described. In the practical part, the task was to prepare standard creamy <b>frozen</b> <b>cream</b> and its subsequent comparison with samples containing different types of dietary fiber. Samples with fiber were eleven and were rated immediately after production and after one week freezing. Results were obtained by sensory analysis, drain tests and tests of stability. Objective was to find the fiber, which would not be noticeable in the sample and whose addition to the formulation would also improve the rheological properties of ice cream. In the next part were produced two samples contain only milk, concentrate from Stevia and dietary fiber.

40|$|Freezing {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as a dependable and economical method of preserving perishable foods. Particularly within {{the last two or}} three decades many advances have been made in this field. There is no doubt today that the art and science of freezing technology have advanced to a point where one can obtain many high quality, nutritious and economical frozen foods. The dairy industry is continually being faced with the problem of seasonal surpluses and shortages. Any technique which would allow surpluses to be carried over into shortage periods would be highly desirable to this industry. Frozen milks may be one such answer. Milk can be produced at lower cost during the spring and summer than during the fall and winter, therefore, it would be an advantage to process milk into such forms that will be suitable for future use. Storage of frozen concentrated milk appears to have possibilities in aiding the needs of the industry and to supply the fluid milk trade with high-quality milk. Furthermore, concentrated milk may have a place in non-milk-producing areas, particularly where transportation is an important cost factor. Though <b>frozen</b> <b>cream</b> has been a standard product in the manufacture of ice cream mixes, the freezing of fluid and concentrated milks for direct consumption has not been practised on any large scale. A frozen three-to-one concentrated milk is not a new product since experimental work goes back to the early 1930 's. However, technical advances, as compared with other industries, were slow, probably due to the unique physical and chemical properties of milk. Protein instability and flavor deterioration have been the main obstacles, either of which limits the storage period. As the storage period is extended this product will undoubtedly develop greater potentials. Since frozen concentrated milk is a food product, attention must be given to the bacterial flora. Further, to add to the knowledge of a comparatively new product and in hope of obtaining information applicable to the industry, studies have been undertaken to determine the effects of processing and storage on the numbers and types of bacteria in frozen concentrated milk...|$|E

40|$|Real-time {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} (PCR) allows rapid detection of Salmonella in frozen dairy products, but it might cause a false positive detection result because it might amplify DNA from dead target cells as well. In this study, Salmonella-free <b>frozen</b> ice <b>cream</b> was initially inoculated with heat-killed Salmonella Typhimurium cells and stored at − 18 °C. Bacterial DNA extracted from the sample was amplified using TaqMan probe-based real-time PCR targeting the invA gene. Our results indicated that DNA from the dead cells remained stable in <b>frozen</b> ice <b>cream</b> for at least 20 days, and could produce fluorescence signal for real-time PCR as well. To overcome this limitation, propidium monoazide (PMA) was combined with real-time PCR. PMA treatment can effectively prevent PCR amplification from heat-killed Salmonella cells in <b>frozen</b> ice <b>cream.</b> The PMA real-time PCR assay can selectively detect viable Salmonella at as low as 103  CFU/mL. Combining 18 hours of pre-enrichment with the assay allows {{for the detection of}} viable Salmonella at 100  CFU/mL and avoiding the false-positive result of dead cells. The PMA real-time PCR assay provides an alternative specifically for detection of viable Salmonella in ice cream. However, when the PMA real-time PCR assay was evaluated in ice <b>cream</b> subjected to <b>frozen</b> storage, it obviously underestimated the contamination situation of viable Salmonella, which might lead to a false negative result. According to this result, the use of enrichment prior to PMA real-time PCR analysis remains as the more appropriate approach...|$|R

40|$|Milk {{and dairy}} {{products}} become integral part of human nutrition and belong to common food. Milk is very valuable because it contains complete proteins. Its disaccharide lactose is a source of energy. Butterfat is easily digestible. Besides potassium, sodium, magnesium, chlorine and sulfur milk contains also dietary elements like calcium and phosphorus. Milk also contains many trace elements like iron, zinc, iodine, selenium, manganese, fluorine, chromium, cobalt, and molybdenum. Milk is {{an important source of}} vitamins. It contains significant amounts of water soluble B and C vitamins alongside fat soluble vitamins E and A and smaller amounts of vitamins K and D. Milk {{and dairy products}} are an important source of calcium. Lack of calcium is the main cause of osteoporosis. Regular consumption of milk and dairy products may reduce the risk of cancer. Nevertheless disproportionate consumption of dairy products containing unsaturated fats can lead to higher incidence of certain types of cancer, higher risk of cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome. Milk contains also compounds that prevent aforementioned diseases. Milk is the only source of nutrients for newborn children and suckled infants. It is convenient source of nutrients in times of higher nutrient demands especially during pregnancy, nursing and senescence. Milk, milk cream, fermented milk products, buttermilk, cheese, whey, curd cheese, whey proteins, <b>frozen</b> <b>creams,</b> cream, condensed and powdered milk belong to most important products. Fermented milk products are very beneficial to human health. Those products are sources of complete proteins, calcium, phosphor and vitamins, especially B vitamins. Lactose is decreased making fermented milk suitable for lactose-intolerant subjects. The fermentation process increases the shelf-life of the product while improving the digestibility and microbiological safety. Milk and dairy products consumption can also have negative impact on human health. Lactase deficiency or lactase insufficient activity in small intestine results in lactose intolerance. Milk can also cause food allergy to the cow's milk...|$|R
