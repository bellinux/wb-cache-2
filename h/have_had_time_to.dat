25|$|The {{observable}} universe is a spherical {{region of the}} Universe comprising all matter that can be observed from Earth at the present time, because electromagnetic radiation from these objects <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> reach Earth {{since the beginning of}} the cosmological expansion. There are at least 2 trillion galaxies in the {{observable universe}}, containing more stars than all the grains of sand on planet Earth. Assuming the Universe is isotropic, the distance to the edge of the observable universe is roughly the same in every direction. That is, the observable universe is a spherical volume (a ball) centered on the observer. Every location in the Universe has its own observable universe, which may or may not overlap with the one centered on Earth.|$|E
25|$|If humans move to {{a higher}} altitude, {{respiration}} and physical exertion become a problem, but after spending time in high altitude conditions they acclimatize to the reduced partial pressure of oxygen, such as by producing more red blood cells. The ability to acclimatize is an adaptation, but the acclimatization itself is not. Fecundity goes down, but deaths from some tropical diseases also goes down. Over {{a longer period of}} time, some people are better able to reproduce at high altitudes than others. They contribute more heavily to later generations, and gradually by natural selection the whole population becomes adapted to the new conditions. This has demonstrably occurred, as the observed performance of long-term communities at higher altitude is significantly better than the performance of new arrivals, even when the new arrivals <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> acclimatize.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the long}} half-life, the {{technique}} is most applicable for dating minerals and rocks more than 100,000 years old. For shorter timescales, {{it is unlikely that}} enough argon-40 will <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> accumulate in order to be accurately measurable. K–Ar dating was instrumental {{in the development of the}} geomagnetic polarity time scale. Although it finds the most utility in geological applications, it plays an important role in archaeology. One archeological application has been in bracketing the age of archeological deposits at Olduvai Gorge by dating lava flows above and below the deposits. It has also been indispensable in other early east African sites with a history of volcanic activity such as Hadar, Ethiopia. The K–Ar method continues to have utility in dating clay mineral diagenesis. Clay minerals are less than 2 micrometres thick and cannot easily be irradiated for Ar–Ar analysis because Ar recoils from the crystal lattice.|$|E

However, others have noted that Marlene had no blood on her clothing when she left the house and would not <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> change clothes; that Riley used a hammer to avoid alerting neighbors because it made less noise than a gunshot; and that according to a hypnosis expert, Riley's revised confession lacked credibility.

500|$|An age of no {{more than}} 750 years for the PSR B1937+21 was at odds with the {{observations}} of the region in other wavelengths. No optical supernova remnant, nor bright x-ray source, had been observed {{in the vicinity of the}} PSR B1937+21. If PSR B1937+21 was that young, it would not <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> move far from the site at which it formed. As neutron stars are formed as the result of supernova explosions, evidence of the explosion should be nearby for a young pulsar. If it was that young, it would also be expected to still be hot, in which case the thermal radiation from PSR B1937+21 would be observable at x-ray wavelengths. Venkatraman Radhakrishnan and G. Srinivasan used the lack of observed supernova remnant to argue that PSR B1937+21 had not formed with such a fast period, but instead had been [...] "spun up" [...] by a companion star which essentially gave the pulsar its angular momentum, a mechanism now generally used to explain millisecond pulsars. They also made a theoretical estimate of the necessary spin down rate to be 1 seconds per second. Backer et al. revised their estimate of the upper limit of the spin down rate just a month after the initial discovery, to 1 seconds per second, but the currently measured value is more nearly in line with the theoretical estimate, at 1.05 seconds per second. The age of PSR B1937+21 was also later determined to be 2.29 years, a value which is consistent with the observational evidence.|$|E

2500|$|Diagnosis is {{achieved}} most commonly by serologic {{testing of the}} blood {{for the presence of}} antibodies against the ehrlichia organism. Many veterinarians routinely test for the disease, especially in enzootic areas. During the acute phase of infection, the test can be falsely negative because the body will not <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> make antibodies to the infection. As such, the test should be repeated. A PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test can be performed during this stage to detect genetic material of the bacteria. The PCR test is more likely to yield a negative result during the subclinical and chronic disease phases. [...] In addition, blood tests may show abnormalities in the numbers of red blood cells, white blood cells, and most commonly platelets, if the disease is present. Uncommonly, a diagnosis can be made by looking under a microscope at a blood smear for the presence of the ehrlichia morulae, which sometimes can be seen as intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies within a white blood cell.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{writers have}} {{unjustly}} accused Cuvier of obstinately maintaining that fossil human beings {{could never be}} found.

Petrified bones, which <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> mineralize and turn to stone, are typically far older than bones found to that date. Cuvier's point was that all human bones found that he knew of, were of relatively recent age because they had not been petrified and had been found only in superficial strata. He was not dogmatic in this claim, however; when new evidence came to light, he included in a later edition an appendix describing a skeleton that he freely admitted was an [...] "instance of a fossil human petrifaction".|$|E
