2500|$|Barbara Alyn Woods portrays Deb Scott, Dan's {{wife and}} Nathan's mother. Initially normal, she later becomes neurotic. Woods said, [...] "She's fun to play, I love Deb Scott, she's a well-rounded character. I can't say I'm {{a lot like}} her, but I think our desires are the same. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to be career women and good moms– I hope I'm a bit more {{successful}} than she is." [...] Explaining their differences, Woods added, [...] "I've never done any drugs in my whole life, I've never even smoked a cigarette– that's where I'd start– lay off the drugs. I'm not a big drinker, so I'd lay off the booze. So, {{that would be a}} good start for a mom I would say. And I've never cheated on my husband." [...] Seventeen years of marriage to Dan have made Deb bitter, and she divorces him in season 3, her hatred of him once driving her to try to kill him. Deb battles an addiction to pills in season 2 and again in season 4, but overcomes it permanently the second time.|$|E
60|$|I {{have taken}} upon {{myself in the}} name of some of you to say that we expect upon these {{principles}} to ultimately beat them. In order to do so, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> and must have a national policy in regard to the institution of slavery that acknowledges and deals with that institution as being wrong. Whoever desires the prevention of the spread of slavery and the nationalization of that institution yields all when he yields to any policy that either recognizes slavery as being right or as being an indifferent thing. Nothing will make you successful but setting up a policy which shall treat the thing as being wrong: When I say this, I do not mean to say that this General Government is charged with the duty of redressing or preventing all the wrongs in the world, but I do think that it is charged with preventing and redressing all wrongs which are wrongs to itself. This Government is expressly charged with the duty of providing for the general welfare. We believe that the spreading out and perpetuity of the institution of slavery impairs the general welfare. We believe--nay, we know--that that {{is the only thing that}} has ever threatened the perpetuity of the Union itself. The only thing which has ever menaced the destruction of the government under which we live is this very thing. To repress this thing, we think, is, Providing for the general welfare. Our friends in Kentucky differ from us. We need not make our argument for them, but we who think it is wrong in all its relations, or in some of them at least, must decide as to our own actions and our own course, upon our own judgment.|$|E
5000|$|We have a {{slightly}} different culture, for us, the [...] "sacral family" [...] {{remains one of the}} company's core values. Our family is a traditional family. If gays like our pasta and our advertisings, they will eat our pasta; if they don't like that, they will eat someone else's pasta. You can't always please everyone not to displease anyone. I would not do a commercial with a homosexual family, not for lack of respect toward homosexuals - who {{have the right to do}} whatever they want without disturbing others - but because I don't agree with them, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to talk to traditional families.

5000|$|An {{official}} of the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) had set out its view of homosexuality in film: [...] "to {{the great majority of}} cinema-goers, homosexuality is outside their direct experience and is something which is shocking, distasteful and disgusting". Relph said that in Victim, by contrast: [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to say is that the homosexual, although subject to a psychological or glandular variation from sexual normality, is a human being subject to all the emotions of other human beings, and as deserving of our understanding. Unless he sets out to corrupt others, it is wrong for the law to pillory him because of his inversion." [...] He said Victim was [...] "a story not of glands but of love." ...|$|E

How can it best be given? And what is it precisely which should be given? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> four things.

5000|$|The {{majority}} of the album was recorded at guitarist Dan Hawkins's home, Leeders Farm, in Norfolk. Discussing the album {{in comparison to the}} band's previous two studio albums, Permission to Land and One Way Ticket to Hell... and Back, drummer Ed Graham noted: [...] "I <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> all feel that the second Darkness album is a bit over produced and maybe lost its way in places, a bit. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to return to the form we were in; <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to make something that was more like Permission to Land than the second album. There are a couple of songs on this new album that are actually really old songs that we played ten years ago when we first formed." ...|$|R
5000|$|Brøderbund's {{relationship}} with Lenar was facilitated by Scott (Kenji) Tsumura, {{who worked for}} IREM and eventually worked for Brøderbund to form the Kyodai Software division. Alan Weiss, the Nintendo Producer at Brøderbund, managed all product development and worked with Lenar to translate {{the text of the}} game. Weiss kept the strange name, Prince Myer, to try to make faithful conversions and not [...] "Americanize" [...] it. The name, [...] "Deadly Towers," [...] came from Ed Bernstein of Brøderbund. In response to the difficulty level of the game, Weiss stated: [...] "We did a lot of testing of the game and we didn't actually find it that difficult at Brøderbund, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> something more challenging than previously published titles to round out our portfolio." ...|$|R
5000|$|El Camino was {{recorded}} in Nashville, Tennessee, at Easy Eye Sound Studio, which was opened by guitarist/vocalist Dan Auerbach in mid-2010 after he relocated from the group's long-time hometown of Akron, Ohio. Carney spoke of how the success of Brothers impacted the follow-up record: [...] "For me, there were physical jitters about everything that was going on. Seeing how big the shows were getting, feeling like people were paying attention, kind of made me anxious, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's {{part of the reason}} El Caminos songs are so fast. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to just muscle through it." [...] Despite the growing expectations of the band, Carney said that the El Camino recording sessions were much more relaxed than those for Brothers, during which he had been dealing with his divorce.|$|R
500|$|The Beauty Process: Triple Platinum is the {{follow-up}} to L7's 1994 album Hungry for Stink, which {{was released by}} Slash Records in collaboration with Reprise Records, a major record label owned by the Warner Music Group. Hungry for Stink peaked at No. 172 on the US Billboard Top 200 chart and coincided with the 1994 Lollapalooza music festival, where the band shared the stage with other successful acts including The Smashing Pumpkins and The Breeders. For their next album, L7 {{decided to take a}} less constrained approach than they took with their previous albums. According to singer and guitarist Donita Sparks, [...] "In the past, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to prove that we were tough cookies. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> to show that we could rock harder than anyone. Now we're more secure. So we have more freedom. It's kind of liberating." ...|$|R

5000|$|For screenwriter Derek Kolstad, both Alistair MacLean and Stephen King {{were huge}} {{influences}} {{in the creation}} of the story of John Wick in terms of characterisation and world-building, stating, with himself stating, [...] "MacLean could build a world, and King could surprise you by what the main character truly was capable of."Outside of films, Stahelski and Leitch drew inspiration from the visual stylings of the '60s and '70s as well as cinematic influences, including Sergio Leone, Akira Kurosawa, Steve McQueen, Lee Marvin, William Friedkin and Sam Peckinpah. With Stahelski himself stating, [...] "All the way back to Kurosawa up to Sergio Leone. We like the spaghetti western sensibility there, some of the composition." [...] Albeit inspiration and emulation from the noir film genre, Stahelski too added that, [...] "Noir maybe was sort of less impactful for us than the other sort of westerns and Kurosawa and things like that. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to make this hard-boiled character." ...|$|R
5000|$|On September 18, 2015 {{the band}} {{released}} [...] "Get Over It". The song had been recorded three weeks prior. A music video {{for the song}} was directed by Andrew Groves.

[...] Following the release of the 'Get Over It' the song spent a near record-breaking 13 weeks at number one on the Kerrang! Chart. A deluxe edition of the album (Lower Than Atlantis: Black) was released with a second disc including 'Get Over It', four other previously un-released tracks, four studio covers, two covers recorded in the BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge, and four songs from the original album recorded acoustically. The band then embarked and their biggest headline tour yet including a sold-out performance at the Roundhouse in London.|$|R
5000|$|Comas {{were also}} an {{inspiration}} for him. [...] "Comas really are peculiar only to the late 20th century. Before, say, 1960, {{people who might have}} gone into a coma simply died. Comas are more modern than plastics or TV. I like the notion that comas can allow a person to radically reinvent themselves upon awakening. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> all <b>want</b> to do that—radically reinvent ourselves—I think it's our deepest need." ...|$|R

"Well <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> {{definitely}} <b>wanted</b> {{to speak}} to as many women as we could and all the pain and struggle that we go through as women to maintain this impossible standard of beauty. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to give it a}} darker edge and take it there and not give you the Disney version of that struggle.

500|$|Carter {{also sought}} to rectify small issues that fans had with the 1998 feature film, The X-Files, explaining, [...] "I think {{if there was any}} trouble with the movie, it was that we promised so much that we didn't deliver all of it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to deliver a lot, and all at once, in these two episodes". Episode co-writer Frank Spotnitz agreed, saying that when The X-Files film was being {{promoted}} with the tagline [...] "The Truth is Revealed," [...] he realized that the answers presented in the movie would not be the answers that many of the fans were wanting to hear. Spotnitz also felt that writing [...] "One Son" [...] was difficult because the episodes that gave answers seemed to be less entertaining for viewers than episodes that presented new questions. Spotnitz, however, acknowledged that this episode was necessary to help explain the complex mythology of the show; he called the episode the [...] "biggest chapter we had time to explore in the nine years we were on the air".|$|R

5000|$|That’s more of {{a comment}} on America {{as a whole and}} television's {{standards}} and practices than it is on us.

2500|$|At {{the close}} of the band's tour in support of Light Grenades (2006), the band entered an {{extended}} hiatus. Vocalist Brandon Boyd noted, [...] "It's not that we were burned out being in a band or being in this band; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we,</b> collectively, were feeling like if we didn't step away from this monster that we created then it would begin to consume us. [...] We had to plant some roots, lest we start to write songs about living on a tour bus. So we had to fall in love, we had to fall out of love, we had to make homes." [...] Guitarist Michael Einziger elaborated further, [...] "It just got to this point where we had been going strong for such {{a long period of time}} that we really accomplished all of our goals. [...] It was like, 'Ok, well what do we do now?' Obviously there are lots of things to do but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to take some time, each of us personally, to explore a little bit and find out what the rest of the world was like."
