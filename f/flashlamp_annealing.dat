40|$|<b>Flashlamp</b> <b>annealing</b> (FLA) {{can form}} {{polycrystalline}} silicon (poly-Si) films with various microstructures {{depending on the}} thickness of precursor amorphous Si (a-Si) films due to the variation of crystallizationmechanisms. Intermittent explosive crystallization (EC) takes place in precursor a-Si films thicker than approximately 2 μm, and the periodicity of microstructure formed resulting from the intermittent EC is independent of the thickness of a-Si films if their thickness is 2 μm or greater. In addition to the intermittent EC, continuous EC and homogeneous solid-phase crystallization (SPC) also occur in thinner films. These crystallizationmechanisms are governed by the ignition of EC at Si film edges and the homogeneous heating of interior a-Si. The results obtained in this study {{could be applied to}} control the microstructures of flash-lamp-crystallized poly-Si films...|$|E
