Returning to his family ashore, Inman was initially given command of the sea fencibles at King's Lynn before he was made Admiralty commissioner at Madras by Lord Mulgrave in 1809.

ABC was hoping that the show, in which it had invested $8 million, would challenge NBC's highly popular Today. AM America debuted on January 6, 1975, with Jennings delivering regular newscasts from Washington. The show never gained ground against Today, and was canceled in <b>just</b> <b>ten</b> months. In November 1975, Jennings moved abroad, this time as ABC's chief foreign correspondent.

5|$|By {{the time}} of the emperor Hadrian the {{proportion}} of Italians in the legions had fallen to <b>just</b> <b>ten</b> percent and provincial citizens now dominated. This low figure is probably {{a direct result of the}} changing needs of military staffing: a system of fixed border defences (Latin: limes) were established around the Empire's periphery under Hadrian, consolidating Trajan's territorial gains. These called for troops to be stationed permanently in the provinces, a prospect more attractive to locally raised rather than Italian troops. The higher prestige and pay to be found in the Italian dominated Praetorian Guard must also have played a role. The majority of the troops in the legions at the start of the 3rd centuryAD were from the more Romanised (though non-Italian) provinces, especially Illyria. As the century progressed, more and more barbarians (Latin: barbari) were permitted to settle inside of, and tasked with aiding in the defence of, Rome's borders. As a result, greater numbers of barbarous and semi-barbarous peoples were gradually admitted to the army.|$|E

5|$|In 1977, American {{director}} George Lucas had released Star Wars, {{a wildly}} successful science fiction film influenced by Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress, among other works.

The two met in San Francisco in July 1978 to discuss the project Kurosawa considered most financially viable: Kagemusha, the epic story of a thief hired as the double of a medieval Japanese lord of a great clan. Lucas, enthralled by the screenplay and Kurosawa's illustrations, leveraged his influence over 20th Century Fox to coerce the studio that had fired Kurosawa <b>just</b> <b>ten</b> years earlier to produce Kagemusha, then recruited fellow fan Francis Ford Coppola as co-producer.|$|E
5|$|In March, the pro-German Yugoslav {{government}} was toppled. A furious Hitler ordered the attack to {{be expanded to}} include Yugoslavia. Operation Marita commenced on 7 April. The Luftwaffe committed StG 1, 2 and 77 to the campaign. The Stuka once again spearheaded the air assault, with a front line strength of 300 machines, against minimal Yugoslav resistance in the air, allowing the Stukas to develop a fearsome reputation in this region. Operating unmolested, they took a heavy toll of ground forces, suffering only light losses to ground fire. The effectiveness of the dive bombers helped bring about Yugoslav capitulation in <b>just</b> <b>ten</b> days. The Stukas also took a peripheral part in Operation Punishment, Hitler's retribution bombing of Belgrade. The dive bombers were to attack airfields and anti-aircraft gun positions whilst the level bombers struck civilian targets.

5|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, both high demand and {{resulting}} high prices have fueled increased smuggling of slow lorises to Japan. Although pet shop employees declare that their slow lorises are captive-bred, the advertisements on the pet store websites indicate that their stocks come from Java, Sumatra, or China. New arrivals to the stores are also variable {{in size and}} age, which has further led the JWCS to suspect the slow lorises are imported illegally. Official, legal trade of slow lorises prior to CITES Appendix I coverage (from 1998 to 2006) was limited to <b>just</b> <b>ten</b> Sunda slow lorises from Malaysia and Myanmar. A review of 24surveys covering wildlife trade between 1990 and 2006 demonstrated 228slow lorises were {{known to have been}} traded unofficially each year and had come from Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Laos.
