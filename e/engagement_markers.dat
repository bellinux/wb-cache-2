40|$|Abstract Employing {{stance and}} <b>engagement</b> <b>markers</b> can clearly {{indicate}} writers’ intentions and opinions in the text. The {{present study was}} conducted to examine Iranian EFL learners' use of interaction markers in balancing the reader-writer relationship in their written tasks. This study involved 14 male and 16 female participants, who took a writing task after being evaluated for their language levels. The tasks were anonymously coded and scored by two raters, and a checklist was developed for keeping a record of the frequency of stance and <b>engagement</b> <b>markers.</b> The differences between the two sets were investigated by t-test and Mann Whitney U test. The mean age of participants (ranging from 19 to 30 years) was 20. 60 ± 1. 01. The male and female participants were highly similar in their language levels; however, they had used stance and <b>engagement</b> <b>markers</b> differently, i. e. the frequency of <b>engagement</b> <b>markers</b> (221 cases) exceeded that of the stance markers (99 cases). T-test revealed no significant difference in their using stance markers; however, there was a slight difference in their use of <b>engagement</b> <b>markers.</b> A conclusion is made: the participants did use stance and <b>engagement</b> <b>markers</b> differently. They used the reader-oriented markers more than the writer-oriented markers. No significant difference in the performance of male and female participants was observed in using stance markers but there was a slight difference for <b>engagement</b> <b>markers.</b> Key words: Interaction Markers; Stance; Engagement; Writing Instruction; Gende...|$|E
40|$|Speakers {{use some}} {{interactional}} resources to convey their feelings or feedbacks to the prepositional content {{and attempt to}} build personal relationships with the listeners. Two of these resources are attitude and <b>engagement</b> <b>markers</b> and are used to express speakers’ attitudes to preposition and to build relationships with listeners, respectively. This study intended to analyze the use of attitude and <b>engagement</b> <b>markers</b> in native English student presentations. To this end, eleven student presentations were extracted from the MiCASE corpus and analyzed to ascertain the use of attitude and <b>engagement</b> <b>markers</b> using Hyland (2005) taxonomy. The results showed that students try more to engage listeners and build relationships with them to ensure they are attentive and follow the presentations. The most common <b>engagement</b> <b>markers</b> were “you” and “see”. These two markers engage speakers and listeners in an explicit manner. Attitude markers received less attention compared with engagement markers; the most common attitude marker found in the presentations was “interesting”. The {{results of this study}} could be included in instructions on how students should use interactive resources such as engagement and attitude markers in their presentations...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest in the way academic writers establish the presence of their readers {{over the past few}} years. Establishing the presence of readers or what Kroll (1984, P. 181) calls imagining “a second voice” is accomplished when a writer refers explicitly to their readers using explicit linguistic resources (reader <b>engagement</b> <b>markers).</b> Although there are some cross-disciplinary studies and only one cross-cultural study (Hinkel, 2002) which has investigated how writers in different disciplines/cultures acknowledge the presence of their readers, no contrastive study has ever been reported to have examined how academic writers from Persian and English writing cultures address their readers in their texts. Drawing on 60 applied linguistics articles (20 English articles written by native English applied linguists, 20 English articles written by native Persian applied linguists and 20 Persian articles written by native Persian applied linguists), this study aimed at seeing how native Persian and English writers engage their readers in their articles. Hyland’s (2005 a) interactional model of stance and engagement was used as an analytical framework to identify the type and frequency of reader <b>engagement</b> <b>markers</b> in these three groups of articles. The result of the analysis showed significant differences in the way native Persian and English represent their readers. Also, considerable differences were observed in categorical distribution of reader <b>engagement</b> <b>markers.</b> </p...|$|E
30|$|We have {{previously}} developed a target <b>engagement</b> <b>marker</b> for the glucagon-like peptide- 1 receptor (GLP- 1 R), the {{positron emission tomography}} (PET) ligand [68 Ga]Ga-DO 3 A-VS-Cys 40 -Exendin- 4, which enables quantitative measurements of GLP- 1 R occupancy in living subjects [5 – 9]. Additionally, drug interaction with the GLP- 1 R can be assessed indirectly and qualitatively by pharmacology such as nausea. However, {{there is a lack}} of biomarkers for in vivo drug pharmacology on the GCGR, especially in the context of GLP- 1 R/GCGR dual agonists. Demonstrating target engagement on the GCCR remains challenging since the dual agonists activate hormone receptors with overlapping pharmacology, as well as potential cross-binding to the GLP 1 R.|$|R
40|$|The {{title of}} this thesis is Interpersonal Metadiscourse Markers used in Michelle Obama Speech. It has two objectives. First, it is aimed at finding out the types of {{interpersonal}} metadiscourse markers in each sentences used in Michelle Obama Speech. Second, it is aimed to explain the functions of them. This research uses qualitative research, because the research does not give the numeral or statictics, but just depends on {{the knowledge of the}} researcher in analyzing the data. The data of this study were analyzed by using some steps; first, reading the speech transcript; second, identifying and classifying the interpersonal metadiscourse markers, then, describing the function of interpersonal metadiscourse markers, and the last steps is interpreting the data and drawing conclusion. The result showed that there are two categories of interpersonal metadiscourse markers used in Michelle Obama Speech; those are interactive and interactional metadiscourse. There are 165 (44, 2 %) interactive metadiscourse and 209 (55, 8 %) interactional metadiscourse. Kinds of interactive metadiscourse found in Michelle Obama Speech are 145 (38, 8 %) transitional which is the highest percentage, because transitional is conjunction that functions to relate one sentence with other sentences, next is 9 (2, 4 %) frame markers, then 7 (1, 8 %) code glosses and the last is 4 (1, 1 %) evidentials. Meanwhile, kinds of interactional metadiscourse found in Michelle Obama Speech are 40 (10, 7 %) hedges, 8 (2, 1 %) boosters, after that 135 (36 %) self mentions. Self Mentions is the dominant interactional metadiscourse, because when Michelle Obama speaks about her opinion, she gives statement to audience who became author for them and the last for interactional category is 26 (7, 0 %) <b>engagement</b> <b>marker...</b>|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} century, {{academic}} performance {{has become the}} gatekeeper to institutions of higher education, shaping career paths and individual life trajectories. Accordingly, much psychological {{research has focused on}} identifying predictors of academic performance, with intelligence and effort emerging as core determinants. In this article, we propose expanding on the traditional set of predictors by adding a third agency: intellectual curiosity. A series of path models based on a meta-analytically derived correlation matrix showed that (a) intelligence is the single most powerful predictor of academic performance; (b) the effects of intelligence on academic performance are not mediated by personality traits; (c) intelligence, Conscientiousness (as marker of effort), and Typical Intellectual <b>Engagement</b> (as <b>marker</b> of intellectual curiosity) are direct, correlated predictors of academic performance; and (d) the additive predictive effect of the personality traits of intellectual curiosity and effort rival that the influence of intelligence.

40|$|Earnings {{conference calls}} {{have become the}} primary channel for oral {{financial}} reporting in today’s globalized corporate world (Tasker 1998, Williams 2008). These events consist of presentations of financial performance by company executives followed by Q&A sessions with financial analysts who participate via teleconferencing. The dialogic Q&A sessions in particular provide an interesting terrain for exploring interactional strategies {{in what may be}} described as high-stakes communication where both parties are under pressure to achieve distinct professional goals (Crawford Camiciottoli 2013). This chapter offers an in-depth analysis of <b>engagement</b> <b>markers</b> in earning conference call Q&A sessions, including questions, imperatives and deontic modals (e. g. should, ought, must), as well as inclusive proforms (e. g. Let’s, you, we, our). The study is based on two small specialized corpora that consist of the transcripts of earnings calls of US-based multinationals. One corpus comprises earning calls that took place prior to the 2008 global financial crisis (the Pre-crisis Corpus), while the other contains earnings calls from late 2009 when the crisis was in full swing (the Crisis Corpus). Text analysis software was used to produce descriptive profiles of <b>engagement</b> <b>markers</b> across the two corpora. The items that emerged were then manually examined within their context of usage to identify patterns of usage that may be linked to the more or less challenging economic environments, to the professional profiles of the discourse participants and to the ICT-mediated interactional setting. The results shed light on how the discourse participants used language not only to engage each other, but also to refrain from engaging, thus providing insights into the complex dynamics of this communicative event which involves strategic choices about which information to disclose. An enhanced understanding of <b>engagement</b> <b>markers</b> in earnings conference calls can find fruitful application in corporate communication courses to help aspiring executives and analysts become more successful interlocutors in this key form of oral financial reporting...|$|E

40|$|Background-—Reducing {{hospital}} readmissions is a {{key component}} of reforms for stroke care. Current readmission prediction models lack accuracy and are limited by data being from only acute hospitalizations. We hypothesized that patient-level factors from a nationwide post–acute care database would improve prediction modeling. Methods and Results-—Medicare inpatient claims for the year 2008 that used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes were used to identify ischemic stroke patients older than age 65. Unique individuals were linked to comprehensive post–acute care assessments through use of the Minimum Data Set (MDS). Logistic regression was used to construct risk-adjusted readmission models. Covariates were derived from MDS variables. Among 39 178 patients directly admitted to nursing homes after hospitalization due to acute stroke, there were 29 338 (75 %) with complete MDS assessments. Crude rates of readmission and death at 30 days were 8448 (21 %) and 2791 (7 %), respectively. Risk-adjusted models identified multiple independent predictors of all-cause 30 -day readmission. Model performance of the readmission model using MDS data had a c-statistic of 0. 65 (95 % CI 0. 64 to 0. 66). Higher levels of social <b>engagement,</b> a <b>marker</b> of nursing home quality, were associated with progressively lower odds of readmission (odds ratio 0. 71, 95 % CI 0. 55 to 0. 92). Conclusions-—Individual clinical characteristics from the post–acute care setting resulted in only modest improvement in the c-statistic relative to previous models that used only Medicare Part A data. Individual-level characteristics do not sufficiently account for the risk of acute hospital readmission. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2015; 4 :e 002145 doi: 10. 1161 /JAHA. 115. 002145...|$|R
40|$|The {{success rate}} in the {{development}} of psychopharmacological compounds is insufficient. Two main reasons for failure have been frequently identified: 1) treating the wrong patients and 2) using the wrong dose. This is potentially based on the known heterogeneity among patients, both on a syndromal and a biological level. A focus on personalized medicine through better characterization with biomarkers has been successful in other therapeutic areas. Nevertheless, obstacles toward this goal that exist are 1) the perception of a lack of validation, 2) the perception of an expensive and complicated enterprise, and 3) the perception of regulatory hurdles. The authors tackle these concerns and focus on the utilization of biomarkers as predictive markers for treatment outcome. The authors primarily cover examples from the areas of major depression and schizophrenia. Methodologies covered include salivary and plasma collection of neuroendocrine, metabolic, and inflammatory markers, which identified subgroups of patients in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. A battery of vegetative markers, including sleep-electroencephalography parameters, heart rate variability, and bedside functional tests, can be utilized to characterize the activity of a functional system that is related to treatment refractoriness in depression (e. g., the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system). Actigraphy and skin conductance can be utilized to classify patients with schizophrenia and provide objective readouts for vegetative activation as a functional <b>marker</b> of target <b>engagement.</b> Genetic <b>markers,</b> related to folate metabolism, or folate itself, has prognostic value for the treatment response in patients with schizophrenia. Already, several biomarkers are routinely collected in standard clinical trials (e. g., blood pressure and plasma electrolytes), and appear to be differentiating factors for treatment outcome. Given the availability {{of a wide variety of}} markers, the further development and integration of such markers into clinical research is both required and feasible in order to meet the benefit of personalized medicine. This article is based on proceedings from the "Taking Personalized Medicine Seriously-Biomarker Approaches in Phase IIb/III Studies in Major Depression and Schizophrenia" session, which was held during the 10 th Annual Scientific Meeting of the International Society for Clinical Trials Meeting (ISCTM) in Washington, DC, February 18 to 20, 2014...|$|R
40|$|The {{notion of}} voice has been {{discussed}} from different perspectives in academic discourse studies, often in relation to discursive identity and self-representation in research genres. Not much attention has been paid, however, to what constitutes authorial voice in a textbook. Textbook writers tend to hide behind {{the values of the}} community, often attributing stance to the community in general, but attention should be paid to ways of expressing epistemic and deontic modality, attitudinal values or evaluations of importance. Focusing on authorial voice in academic textbooks, this chapter looks at writers’ professional identities, studying how writers relate discursively to their object of discourse as well as to other textual voices, especially other discourse participants - the student-reader and the discourse community at large. The chapter presents an overview of the literature on voice in textbooks showing that this has often looked at textbooks as merely expositive texts, concealing the argumentative nature of science in an attempt to offer an established view of the discipline. The literature review also shows that a range of lexico-grammatical tools can be used in the typical moves of instructional discourse. These include self-mention, forms of <b>engagement</b> and <b>markers</b> of evaluation, highlighting the writer’s interpretative position in the text and the dialogic involvement of other voices: issues like factivity, hedging, attribution, metadiscourse and repetitive textual structures can contribute to the voice of the textbook writer addressing the student as well as the colleague. The overview of the literature is followed by a sample study of a corpus of academic history, representative of the authorial voices university students are exposed to in their early studies. Historical discourse seems to deviate from some specific tendencies noted in the hard and social sciences. Hedging, for example, is found to be more frequent in textbook chapters than in journal articles, but it is also accompanied by greater display of data and facts. The overview of positive and negative keywords reveals a varied use of authorial voice: the Textbook writer moves between the Recounter (with an emphasis on facts and the narrative) and the Intepreter (assessing historical actors and processes of change), whereas the researcher talking to other researchers in the journal article highlights the Academic Arguer (placing the research {{in the context of a}} debate). Markers of importance prove to be in line with this tendency, variously showing a preference for forms that assess entities and processes, rather than alternative perspectives. The voice of the Interpreter, supported by the authority of the Recounter, may well be the most suitable for a genre addressing such a wide range of readers with their background knowledge and expertise...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This article aims at {{reporting}} {{on some of}} the preliminary results of an on-going study on the difference of the use of metadiscourse strategies in e-mail writing between a Polish teacher and a Chinese student. Drawing on Hyland’s (2005) Metadiscourse Theory, the purpose of the analysis is to show how the use of metadiscourse devices varies between an English-speaking person and a non English-speaking person in e-mail writing which covers a time period from 9 December 2013 to 1 January 2014. According to the analysis, we found out that metadisourse devices are frequently used in E-mail writing. Thanks to the different thinking mode and different ideology, people from different countries may use metadisourse devices differently. For example, the Polish Peter used more <b>engagement</b> <b>markers</b> than the Chinese student Tina did. While Tina used more hedges than Peter did.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{determine}} how three key preschool factors - children’s relationships with adults, self-concept and mental health problems - predicted their classroom engagement during {{their first year of}} school. The preschool-school transition represents a ‘window of opportunity’ where appropriate intervention efforts may help enhance children’s engagement, a critical aspect of adjusting to school. However, a major barrier in developing effective interventions is that little is known regarding the mechanisms by which key factors predict engagement in the early school years. To address this limitation, this thesis tested a social-motivational model which specifies that parentchild and teacher-child relationships indirectly promote children’s engagement, by first strengthening their self-concept and mental health. Engagement was also examined from a resilience perspective, conceptualised as ‘better than expected’ engagement given children’s experience of cumulative risk. Participants were 575 young children recruited from the 27 preschools within one South Australian school district. Data were collected from their parents and teachers across three waves at yearly intervals, using a longitudinal prospective design. In preschool, both parents and preschool teachers completed questionnaires assessing the quality of children’s parent-child and teacher-child relationships, self-concept and mental health problems. Parents also reported on several family risk factors (e. g., parental psychological distress and unemployment, single parent households). One year later, teachers rated children’s classroom engagement levels in their first year of school. Additionally, a randomly selected sub-sample of children were interviewed and observed regarding their engagement during a normal school day. Finally, in the third study year, teachers reported on children’s school progress, disciplinary action, absences and lateness. A range of path analytic techniques were used to test the hypothesised associations between these variables. Results showed that good quality relationships with parents and teachers during preschool were indirectly associated with children’s subsequent classroom engagement, through their associations with preschool self-concept and mental health problems. With all predictor variables included in the model, only preschool mental health problems was uniquely related to children’s engagement. Associations between mental health problems and engagement were similar for boys and girls. However, boys showed significantly higher levels of externalising problems and lower levels of engagement. Similar mediating mechanisms operated in contexts of risk, by predicting children’s resilience (i. e., ‘better than expected’ engagement). Children’s relationships with parents and teachers, and their self-concept and mental health problems are important predictors of their subsequent classroom <b>engagement.</b> These preschool <b>markers</b> could be used to identify groups of children at risk of developing low engagement. Furthermore, interventions that target these factors may boost children’s engagement, helping them start school ready and eager to learn. Although these interventions may benefit boys and girls equally, boys may need more intensive support to help them start school on more equal footing with girls. Furthermore, the same intervention efforts may help both high- and low-risk children. Such interventions may disrupt pathways leading to poor engagement among at-risk children, while also equipping other children with the strengths they need to cope with adverse circumstances before any such risk is experienced.

Five hundred sixty-three high school adolescents (ages 13 to 19) completed self-administered questionnaires that assessed school <b>engagement</b> <b>markers,</b> peer influences, sexual début, and risky sex. Major findings for boys indicate that GPA was negatively associated with both sexual début and risky sex.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} a corpus of ninety discussion sections of applied linguistics research articles, {{with the goal}} of analyzing different aspects of academic written discourse. Three types of texts were considered: English texts written by native speakers of English, English texts written by Iranians (as non-natives of English), and Persian texts written by Iranians. In order to understand the cultural differences between Persian and English-speaking researchers, the following metadiscourse sub-types adapted from Hyland's (2004) model were examined: transitions, frame markers, endophoric markers, evidentials, code glosses, hedges, boosters, attitude markers, <b>engagement</b> <b>markers,</b> and self-mentions. The first five comprise interactive metadiscourse, and the rest comprise interactional metadiscourse. After the detailed analysis of the metadiscourse types in question, chi-square tests were carried out to clarify the probable differences. The analysis revealed how academic writings of these groups differed in their rhetorical strategies using metadiscourse type because of their respective mother tongues. However, the different groups were found to use all sub-types of metadiscourse. Yet, some subcategories were used differently by the writers of these two languages. In addition, interactive metadiscoursal factors (those resources which help to guide the reader through the text such as transitions, frame markers, etc.) were used significantly more than interactional metadiscoursal factors (those resources involve the reader in the argument such as hedges, boosters, etc.) by both groups...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWriting is like {{a mirror}} that {{reflects}} the social and personal realities. Any culture and society has some specific ways and strategies for text and talk organization and communication, e. g. generic conventions, moves, metadiscourse markers, etc. are some of such strategies for better text organization and communication. Metadiscourse categories are specific rhetorical devices that help the participants to effectively {{communicate with each other}} (Hyland, 2005). Employing these interactional devices is different in various languages and societies, in other words metadiscourse strategies are context dependent. In order to find differences between the use of interactional metadiscourse strategies, in two different societies and contexts, we analyzed and critically interpreted their usage in the discussion sections of 40 research articles written by Iranian and English scholars in English. This critical analysis was based on the socio-cognitive approach of van Dijk. This analysis showed similarities and differences in the rhetorical behaviour of these authors in their use of interactional metadiscoursive strategies. There was a considerable tendency to the use of ‘hedging’ by both groups of writers. The main difference was in the use of self-mentions and <b>engagement</b> <b>markers.</b> The frequency rate of such strategies was very low amongst Iranian writers. The social constructions and cognition of participants may have undeniable effects on the use of interactional strategies. The findings of such studies can have useful implications for ESL, EFL, and ESP courses in general; and for developing academic literacy in particular...|$|E

The data, graded by teacher-raters as between A to C grades using an in-house can-do scale for successful academic stance, interaction and comprehensibility, was annotated for 22 error types, an exhaustive range of interactive and interpersonal metadiscourse (following Hyland, 2005) {{and a range}} of temporal, prosodic, lexical and syntactic markers (or 'fluencemes') of (dis) fluency (following Götz, 2013). The results suggest that successful, frequent use of metadiscourse (particularly <b>engagement</b> <b>markers</b> and topic shifts) is the primary indicator of raters' positive evaluation of student performance in L 2 academic tutorial discussion alongside temporal fluencemes (namely speech rate per minute). Identical repeats and errors of idiom / collocation are salient to raters' negative appraisals, while other L 2 errors and other individual prosodic (e. g. pauses), lexical (e. g. reformulations) and syntactic fluencemes (e. g. interrupted structures, dependent clauses) do not particularly feature in raters' positive (or negative) evaluations. The detailed cross-sectional data afforded via this kind of corpus analysis serves as quantitative evidence of the linguistic features involved in grading decisions across the rubric, which can (and should) be used in discussions of standardisation and moderation for the raters involved...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} multimodal discourse of academic posters from three disciplines, namely, Chemistry, Speech & Hearing Sciences and Linguistics, {{in an attempt}} to unravel how writers from different disciplinary communities build their communicative purposes into the verbal and visual modes in their posters. The analytical framework adopted for this study builds upon the one proposed by D’Angelo(2010), which incorporates Hyland’s metadiscourse model (2005) and Kress and van Leeuwen’s visual grammar paradigm (2006) for the verbal and visual analyses respectively, and supplements it with multimodal content analysis adapted from Jones’s (2007) model. Follow-up interviews with members of the discourse communities were also conducted to enhance the validity of the results. The findings reveal that there exist a wide range of differences in the use of metadiscourse markers (e. g. hedges, boosters, evidentials, code glosses) across the three group texts pertaining to disciplinary influences. There is also evidence that academics in different subjects value some of the same qualities in the texts necessitated either by the peculiar context of poster presentations (e. g. frame markers, <b>engagement</b> <b>markers)</b> or a need to maintain scientific formality (e. g. self-mentions). Visually, the concern for the context and ‘scientificness’ continue to exert great influences, rendering a myriad of visual manifestations (e. g. framing, modality) that are commonly shared across the data, whereas the cross-discipline discrepancy mainly narrows down to the image usage(functions and types). published_or_final_versionApplied English StudiesMasterMaster of Arts in Applied Linguistic...|$|E
40|$|Metadiscourse is an {{appealing}} field of inquiry which {{plays an important}} role in organizing and producing persuasive writing, based on the norms and expectations of people involved. The fuzziness of the term Metadiscourse remains obscure as it is seen in the literature. Having based this work on Ken Hyland’s framework for Metadiscourse, the researchers applied his definition and classification of the term. Hyland describes Metadiscourse as the linguistic resources used to organize a discourse or the writer’s stance towards either its content or the reader. He has divided Metadiscourse into two broad groups: Interactive and Interactional. The former being subcategorized into: Transitions, Frame markers, Endophoric markers, Evidentials, and Code-glosses. And the later being divided into Hedges, Boosters, Attitude markers, <b>Engagement</b> <b>markers,</b> and Self-mentions (Hyland, 2005). Focusing on these categorizations, the researchers would try to shed light on the Metadiscourse features applied in “Alice in Wonderland”, selected from the ‘Complete Illustrated Lewis Carroll’, and see how and to what extent Lewis Carroll has applied these Metadiscourse markers to make his story more impressive and persuasive. Of course, Hedges have not been counted in this novel because of the many works done about this marker earlier. The results of the study showed that the frequencies in Interactive/Interactional Metadiscourse groups have no meaningful differences. However, the frequencies demonstrate that the author has been fully aware of the norms of writing. The results of the study have pedagogical implications for teaching English Literature for literature students and language learners at pre-, upper-, and high-intermediate levels of language learning courses...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the ways English native and Arab EFL student writers in a UK university from two disciplines (i. e. Linguistics and Literature) use language in their master’s dissertations to interact with readers. How they present themselves and convey judgements and opinions, and how they connect with readers and establish rapport were examined by the employment of Hyland’s (2005 b) model of stance and engagement, which encompasses nine categories: hedges, boosters, attitude markers, self-mentions, reader references, directives, asides, questions, and references to shared knowledge. The primary data used consisted of a corpus of 39 master’s dissertations and discourse-based semi-structured interviews with 15 of the writers. While a corpus analysis helped to reveal which features were overused and which ones were underused, interviews were conducted to discover more about {{how and why the}} writer participants used such features in their academic writing. The findings suggest that {{while it is true that}} both disciplinary community and cultural background are very likely to have an impact on the way writers position themselves and their readers, there are other factors related to the students’ conceptions of academic writing in general and their audience in particular which appear to have a more vital role in the writers’ use of stance and <b>engagement</b> <b>markers.</b> These include personality differences, stylistic preferences, previous education, and supervisors’ comments and advice. The thesis closes by exploring the implications of this study for both EAP writing pedagogy and dissertation supervision and proposing some new directions for future research...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates {{metadiscourse}} in the dissertation abstracts {{written by}} Native Speakers of Turkish (NST), Turkish Speakers of English (TSE) and Native Speakers of English (NSE) in the Social Sciences {{to determine how}} they make use of metadiscourse devices. It attempts to determine whether student writers from a shared cultural background (Turkish) tend to use similar rhetorical features to those of their mother tongue or harmonise themselves with the language (English) {{in which they are}} writing. Metadiscourse as a rhetorical device for the effective use of language facilitates writers in guiding their readers, conveying their ideas, establishing and determining the social distance of the reader-writer relationship, and creating an involved style of writer persona or a more remote stance. In that sense, interactive resources employed by writers help readers to find the information needed and interactional resources convey to readers the personality of the writers and their assertions. In addition, using ‘more personal’ resources is a way of keeping readers more intentionally within the text to interpret what is proposed by the writers personally and to judge them. The overall aim of the study is to compare and contrast 90 abstracts of dissertations produced by native Turkish speakers (30), native English speakers (30) and Turkish speakers of English (30) in the Social Sciences and to consider how writing in English (L 2) deviates from writing in Turkish (L 1) and becomes closer to the target language in terms of the metadiscourse elements, that is, interactive resources (transitions, frame markers, endophoric markers, evidentials and code glosses) and interactional resources (hedges, boosters, attitude markers, <b>engagement</b> <b>markers</b> and self-mentions). ...|$|E
40|$|Theme: The Third International Symposium on Chinese Language and DiscourseThe Booklet can {{be viewed}} at: [URL] view of the {{increasing}} importance of the Chinese language internationally {{now and in the}} future, research published in Chinese will be receiving more attention, and how to write about research in this language is worth studying, including the writing of PhD dissertations. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to report on the findings of an analysis of the discourse of 60 Chinese PhD dissertations. These dissertations are from a leading comprehensive university in China, covering six disciplines – applied linguistics, public administration, business studies, computer science, electronic engineering and biology. The analysis was conducted from three perspectives. Firstly, the structures of these dissertations were identified, being the traditional-complex type (Introduction-Literature Review-Methodology-Results/Findings-Discussion –Conclusions) or topic-based (Introduction-Theme/Topic 1 -Theme/Topic 2 -Theme/Topic 3 -Conclusion) (Paltridge, 2003). Then the genetic moves in the Introduction chapter and the Conclusion chapter were analyzed using the genre approach (Swales, 1990). These moves include general background to the study, general review of the literature, and general introduction to the main study in the Introduction; summary of major findings, overall conclusions (and implications), and directions for future research in the Conclusion, albeit some are field-oriented while others are thesis-oriented. Finally linguistic devices employed by the authors to express stances were examined, including the use of hedges (eg. keneng [may], jianyi [suggest]), boosters (eg. xian’er yijian [obviously], shiji shang [in fact]), attitude markers (eg. ling ren chijing de shi [surprisingly], you yisi de shi [interestingly]), <b>engagement</b> <b>markers</b> (eg. zhuyi [note that], (duzhe/nin) keyi kanchu [you can see that]), and self-mentions (eg. wo [I] and wo’men [we]) (Hyland, 2004). These perspectives were then compared cross disciplines with a view to delineating the construction of disciplinary identities (Hyland, 2012). Being expandable to include a larger number of dissertations in more disciplines, this research will enrich the literature on academic writing in Chinese. It will also have useful implications for writing Chinese PhD dissertations as well as the teaching of it...|$|E

This {{study was}} {{primarily}} intended to explore metatextual devices in EFL learners undergraduate thesis. The analysis was centered around metadiscourse taxonomy by Hyland (2005), cooperative principle (Maxim) by Grice, and cooperative principle based model of metadiscourse (metatext) devices by Abdi R (2010). This study explored kinds of metatextual devices in EFL learners‘ undergraduate thesis. The term metadiscourse (metatext) are {{the ways we}} articulate and construct interactions, stressing the fact that, as we speak or write, we negotiate with others, making decisions {{about the kind of}} effects we are having on our listeners or readers (Hyland, 2012 : 126). This study aims to (1) to find out metatextual devices commonly found in EFL learner‘s undergraduate thesis, (2) to find out how EFL learners‘ of IAIN Syekh Nurjati use common metatextual device in the thesis. There relate to the two research question of this study. The research is designed as qualitative research. The data is taken from undergraduate thesis belonging alumni of English language department in 2015. The technique of collecting data is documentation. Then, analyzed with content analysis based on Hyland‘s model investigate the devices that commonly used and how the used of common metatextual devices in the text. The data taken from the clever students, because product from the clever students is reliable and the data more valid. The thesis that analyzed by researcher are one sampling from alumni in 2015. That is not all part of thesis which analyzed, it just introduction chapter because this part of thesis have a key knowledge or information {{about what is going on}} in the next chapter related to the purposes of the study. The result shows that all of devices found in undergraduate thesis including transitions, frame markers, code glosses, evidential markers, <b>engagement</b> <b>markers,</b> self mention, endophoric markers, hedges, booster, and attitude markers, from all of those devices the metatextual devices commonly found in Dinto‘s undergraduate thesis is frame markers. Then, the use of common metatextual device in undergraduate thesis hypothesized that frame marker is a device which mostly help to meet the requirements of manner in the cooperative principle model because it help a writer making a text clearly such cooperative principle exactly maxim of manner.

40|$|The {{topic of}} gender {{differences}} {{has proved to be}} a popular line of inquiry for researchers for decades, and the recent growing interest in the pervasive phenomenon of metadiscourse makes it a major domain in the research of discourse analysis and corpus-based analyses. This study extends the investigation of gender and metadiscourse to newspaper opinion columns. The study seeks to explore both gender and metadiscourse in media texts by analyzing a corpus of British and Saudi opinion columns. Using corpus-linguistics techniques, the study aims to investigate gender differences in the writings of men and women columnists regarding their use of metadiscourse and selected linguistic and stylistic features. Drawing on Hyland’s (2005) model of metadiscourse, the study further aims to compare the use of metadiscourse markers among both columnists in order to identify which categories predominate in this type of discourse and how they are distributed according to cultural preferences. The corpus consists of 320 opinion columns totaling 273, 773 words, selected from four elite newspapers. The columns were searched electronically using concordancing software programs and then all the metadiscourse devices were examined qualitatively in context to determine their actual functions. All frequencies reported have been normalized and tested statistically. Results confirmed that there were 33, 854 metadiscourse tokens in the corpus, an average of 105. 49 occurrences per column or 3 elements of metadiscourse in every 25 words in each of the two corpora. Findings revealed both male and female columnists showed more similarities than differences in their overall use of metadiscourse especially in the interactive dimension. In spite of that, some significant gender-based variations in the use of interactional dimension of metadiscourse were also found. Female columnists used more self-mentions, <b>engagement</b> <b>markers,</b> adjectives, pronouns, and adverbs than their male counterparts, and tended to adopt a personalized engaging subjective style that relies on personal experiences. In contrast, male columnists used more hedges, verbs, numerical terms, and swear words, and tended to adopt a more factual informative style. In addition, results revealed that both columnists made use of interactive and interactional metadiscourse, and some statistically significant variations in the amount and type of metadiscourse were reported. The study concludes that metadiscourse is a useful concept in the discourse of opinion columns and that gender is a significant source of variation that influences the linguistic and the stylistic choices of opinion columnists along with the genre’s conventions...|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{proposes a}} comparative {{exploration of the}} use of some metadiscourse resources in a small corpus of texts from popular scientific magazines in English and Italian, namely Scientific American (henceforth SA) and Le Scienze (henceforth LS). Scientific popularization is a meeting point of different discourse communities with their own needs, intentions and modes of communication (see Calsamiglia 2003, Myers 2003, Gotti 2005, 2013). Metadiscourse (cf., among others, Crismore and Farnsworth 1990, Crismore, Markkanen, Steffensen 1993, Hyland 1998, 2005) can be modulated and can modulate communication in different ways, as it covers a variety of linguistic elements which are aimed at organizing the text for its readers – the interactive dimension – and at engaging them in exposition and argumentation – the interactional dimension (see Hyland 2005). Recent research (e. g. Neff and Dafouz 2008, Musacchio and Ahmad 2009, Musacchio and Palumbo 2010, Suau 2010, Masi 2013) has indeed pursued comparisons of metadiscourse devices associated with scientific discourse domains and genres of popularisation in different languages to appraise the extent of cross-linguistic correspondence and avoid, for example, inappropriate translations. 	Special attention is here devoted to both interactive and interactional devices of metadiscourse, i. e. the representation of scientific and non-scientific ‘actors’ (cf. Calsamiglia 2003, Calsamiglia and López Ferrero 2003) through a range of acts of reporting as evidentials, i. e. the most explicit form of inclusion of other-discourse/voice in one’s discourse, as well as through a selection of self-mention and <b>engagement</b> <b>markers</b> lending themselves to quantitative along with qualitative evaluation. Altogether, the variety of items under analysis can be viewed as representing the three axes (third person reference vs. I/we vs. you) for the construction and evaluation of the roles of different identities (including text producer and implied target receiver) in scientific popularisation. Language diversification, then, is here tackled both from the intra-linguistic standpoint of the different construction of identities within a form of media discourse, and from a cross-linguistic viewpoint, i. e. the extent to which such constructions differ in the two language samples in question, in the attempt to ultimately detect possible preferential metadiscourse strategies that are specific to each language represented in the corpus. The macro-analytical background presupposed by the works here referred to (in particular Calsamiglia and López Ferrero 2003) is that of Critical Discourse Analysis, although the implications of the present research are also relevant for the perspective of Language Variation (and, to some extent, for Translation too) ...|$|E
40|$|Summary of the {{doctoral}} dissertation Interpersonality Strategies in International Student Handbooks Written by Native Speakers of English (NSE) and Non-native Speakers of English (NNSE) Tesis doctoral presentada por: Stan McDaniel Mann Valencia, 2014 	Have you ever read a brochure or handbook written in English by a non-native speaker of English (NNSE), {{noticed that the}} grammar and syntax was excellent and the terminology was near-perfect, but you still {{did not understand the}} essence of what the author was trying to communicate, or you had the feeling that the information was ambiguous? It was precisely for these two reasons that this research on interpersonality strategies was carried out. Through this analysis it is hoped to contribute to explaining why international student handbooks written by NNSE do not persuade effectively enough and do not establish a proper writer-reader relationship, which are precisely two of the main goals of interpersonality. Interpersonality is also referred to as interactional metadiscourse or interpersonal metadiscourse, and all three terms are used interchangeably throughout this study. 	Since the term metadiscourse was coined over 50 years ago, the definitions for it have continuously evolved. Metadiscourse may be broadly described as overtly expressing the writer´s acknowledgement of the reader (Dahl, 2004, p. 1811). There are two classifications of metadiscourse, textual metadiscourse and interactional metadiscourse. For this study, interactional metadiscourse has been chosen due to its focus on establishing a close writer-reader relationship. 	Hyland and Tse´s (2004) model of analysis proved to be the most reliable for this study {{due to the fact that}} it was the first classification of interactional metadiscourse markers with 5 main interactional metadiscourse categories: hedges, boosters, attitude markers, <b>engagement</b> <b>markers,</b> and self-mentions, each category with its corresponding subcategories for a more precise classification and analysis. The main objective was to see the difference of interpersonal metadiscourse usage between NSE and NNSE authors of international student handbooks. The corpus for this study consisted of 50 international student handbooks written by NSE authors, 10 handbooks from 10 different universities from the following NSE countries: USA, Canada, UK, Ireland, and Australia, and 50 handbooks written by NNSE authors, 10 handbooks from 10 different universities from the following NNSE countries: France, Germany, Italy, Turkey, and Japan. A total of 31, 989 interpersonal metadiscourse markers from NSE handbooks were classified and analyzed, and a total of 12, 948 interpersonal metadiscourse markers from NNSE handbooks were classified and analyzed. 	This study was rather unique in that, unlike the vast majority of the previous research performed on interpersonal metadisdourse which was done on the genre of the research article, it was focused on the business-academic genre of international student handbooks. 	For the statistical analysis, the obtained data was submitted to SPSS, and the ANOVA and T-tests were run. For the percentage analysis, percentages were computed for the main categories and subcategories of interactional metdisdourse. Significant and highly significant differences were discovered and discussed. On a general level, NNSE authors used a total of 10. 03...|$|E
