Certain selected areas were also studied at the transmission electron microscope, following standard technical procedures. We observed distinct patterns {{in the distribution of}} cilia, microvilli and supraependymal structures (nerve-like and <b>fibrous</b> <b>astrocyte</b> fibers), and also a small number of blebs. It the lateral transition zone between the floor and roof of the lateral ventricle were found interconrected stellate bulgings measuring an average 98 x 190 mm, constituted by a complex meshwork of processes from fibrous astrocytes, without ependymal lining and with few cell bodies. In the junction between these formations and the underlying neuropil, ciliated ependymal-cell-like glial cells were found to delimit complex labyrinthic spaces.

40|$|This report {{presents}} ultrastructural {{observations on}} the cytological events that attend myelin formation occurring {{in the wake of}} demyelination in adult cat spinal cord. Lesions were induced in subpial cord by cerebrospinal fluid (c. s. f.) exchange (1, 2). Tissue from eleven cats at nine intervals from 19 to 460 days was fixed in situ by replacing c. s. f. with buffered OsO 4 and embedded in Araldite. After demyelination, axons are embraced by sheet-like glial processes. An occasional myelin sheath is first seen at 19 days; by 64 days, all axons are at least thinly myelinated. The cytoplasm of the myelin-forming cells, unlike that of either oligodendrocyte or <b>fibrous</b> <b>astrocyte</b> in normal cord, is dense with closely packed organelles and fine fibrils. Many of the myelinogenic cells become scarring astrocytes and at 460 days the lesion teems with their fibril-filled processes. Oligodendrocytes appear in the lesion after remyelination is under way. Phagocytes disappear gradually. A myelin sheath is formed by spiral wrapping of a sheet-like glial process around an axon. Where the first turn of the spiral is completed, a mesaxon is formed. As cytoplasm is lost from the process, the plasma membrane comes together along its outer and cytoplasmic surfaces to form compact myelin. Only a small amount of cytoplasm is retained; it is confined to the paramesaxonal region and, on the sheath exterior, to a longitudinal ridge which appears in profile as a small loop. This outer loop has the same rotational orientation as the inner mesaxon. These vestiges of spiral membrane wrapping are also found in normal adult and new-born cat cord. Nodes are present in all stages of remyelination and in normal adult cat and kitten cord. These observations suggest that myelin is reformed in the lesion in the same way it is first formed during normal development. The mechanism of myelin formation is basically similar to that proposed for peripheral nerve and amphibian and mammalian optic nerve; it does not agree with present views on the mechanism of myelinogenesis in mammalian brain and cord. This is the first demonstration of remyelination in adult mammalian central nervous tissue...|$|E

40|$|The water {{permeability}} of {{cell membranes}} differs by orders of magnitude, {{and most of}} this variability reflects the differential expression of aquaporin water channels. We have recently found that the CNS contains {{a member of the}} aquaporin family, aquaporin- 4 (AQP 4). As a prerequisite for understanding the cellular handling of water during neuronal activity, we have investigated the cellular and subcellular expression of AQP 4 in the retina and optic nerve where activity-dependent ion fluxes have been studied in detail. In situ hybridization with digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes and immunogold labeling by a sensitive postembedding procedure demonstrated that AQP 4 and AQP 4 mRNA were restricted to glial cells, including MHller cells in the retina and <b>fibrous</b> <b>astrocytes</b> in the optic nerve. A quantitative immunogold analysis of the MHller cells showed that these cells exhibited three distinct membrane compartments with regard to AQP 4 expression. End feet membranes (facing the vitreous body or blood vessels) were 10 - 15 times more intensely labeled than non-end feet membranes, whereas microvilli were devoid of AQP 4. These data suggest that MHller cells play a prominent role in the water handling in the retina and that they direct osmotically driven water flux to the vitreous body and vessels rather than to the subretinal space. <b>Fibrous</b> <b>astrocytes</b> in the optic nerve similarly displayed a differential compartmentation of AQP 4. The highest expression of AQP 4 occurred in end feet membranes, whereas the membrane domain facing the nodal axolemma was associated with a lower level of immunoreactivity {{than the rest of the}} membrane.

40|$|Changes in the {{population}} of microtubules and filaments within the cytoplasm of maturing axons and astrocytes have been studied during the early postnatal development of rat optic nerves. At birth, all of the axons are unmyelinated; most have a diameter of 0. 2 - 0. 3 # and contain 4 - 10 microtubules. Neurofilaments do not occur with any frequency until about 5 days postnatal when they appear as individual groups, each containing 4 - 12. Subsequently, the neurofilaments of each group disperse so that they become more evenly distributed in mature axons. Developing astrocytes show similar but rather more dramatic changes. Most astrocytic processes contain only microtubules at birth, but during maturation filaments begin to appear in increasing numbers while microtubules become less common. This process continues until, in the mature <b>fibrous</b> <b>astrocytes,</b> filaments pack the cytoplasm and microtubules are rare.

Results: Ultrastructural analysis revealed two basic patterns of vitreoretinal pathology in eyes with vitreomacular traction syndrome. Seven specimens showed mostly single cells or a cellular monolayer covering closely the vitreal side of the ILM, not resulting in a biomicroscopically detectable epiretinal fibrocellular proliferation.

The grafts displayed long-term survival and expressed several organotypical characteristics of normal human spinal cord. Three cell types {{of different sizes}} —small, intermediate, and large — and {{two different types of}} neuropil, with and without myelinated axons, were observed in the central cellular layer. The myelin-free area was formed between and round small neurons and was composed of many nonmyelinated fibers and bundles of fine axons. The hostgraft interface, especially around vessels from host iris, exhibited marked interdigitations of astrogllal processes and basement membranes. Thick, superficial glial layers containing many <b>fibrous</b> <b>astrocytes</b> and many glial processes were also seen in both the intermediate axonal and central cellular layers. Thin-walled vessels were clustered in the central layer, and their perivascular spaces contained collagen fibers. No central nervous system-type vessels were observed.

Objective: To determine the effects of the atorvastatin- meloxicam association on reactive gliosis in a model of cerebral ischemia produced by arterial embolization. Materials and methods: 56 adult male Wistar rats were used, divided into four ischemic and four control groups, plus 10 additional animals to determine the distribution and extent of infarction by injury in six of them and simulation (sham) in the remaining four. The treatments were: placebo, atorvastatin (ATV), meloxicam (MELOX) and ATV + MELOX in ischemic and simulated animals. 24 hours post-ischemia mitochondrial enzymatic activity was evaluated with triphenyl- tetrazolium (TTC), and at 120 hours astrocytic reactivity (anti-GFAP) was analyzed by conventional immunohistochemistry. Results: The association ATV + MELOX favored the modulation of the response of protoplasmatic and <b>fibrous</b> <b>astrocytes</b> in both the hippocampus and the paraventricular zone by reducing their hypereactivity.

In this study, we used immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and FACS to analyze the spatial and temporal expression of CD 44 and characterize the CD 44 -positive cells in the mouse cerebellum during development. CD 44 expression was observed not only in astrocyte precursor cells but also in neural stem cells and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) at early postnatal stages. CD 44 expression in OPCs was shut off during oligodendrocyte differentiation.

In agreement with previous studies, resting pHi in cultured astrocytes was 6. 82 ± 0. 06 and inhibition of the V-ATPase H+ pump by Cl− removal or via the selective inhibitor bafilomycin had only a small effect upon resting pHi and recovery following an acid load. In contrast, resting pHi in RON astrocytes was 7. 10 ± 0. 04, significantly less acidic than that in cultured cells (p < 0. 001), and responded to inhibition of V-ATPase with profound acidification to the 6. 3 – 6. 5 range. Fluorescent immuno-staining and immuno-gold labeling confirmed the presence V-ATPase in the cell membrane of RON astrocyte processes and somata. Using ammonia pulse recovery, pHi recovery in RON astrocyte was achieved largely via V-ATPase with sodium-proton exchange (NHE) playing a minor role.

40|$|The epitope H {{contains}} an O-linked N-acetylglucosamine residue {{in a specific}} conformation and/or environment recognized by the monoclonal antibody H. It has previously been shown that the epitope H is present in several types of normal and pathological cells and in several polypeptides. In normal human brains the epitope H is present mostly to a minority of <b>fibrous</b> <b>astrocytes,</b> whereas it is greatly up-regulated in reactive astrocytes and is increased in well differentiated fibrillary astrocytomas compared to anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas. In this study {{the expression of the}} epitope H was investigated in thirty cases of gemistocytic (WHO grade II), pilocytic (WHO grade I), and subependymal giant cell (WHO grade I) astrocytomas using the mAbH with the indirect immunoperoxidase method. The ten cases of gemistocytic astrocytomas revealed an overall high expression pattern. The ten cases of pilocytic astrocytomas revealed a biphasic pattern of epitope H expression. The dense tumor areas composed of elongated pilocytic cells revealed high expression of the epitope H. The loose cystic tumor areas composed of stellate cells revealed low expression of the epitope H. The ten cases of subependynal giant cell astrocytomas occurring in tuberous sclerosis revealed an overall high expression pattern. This study shows that there is high expression of the epitope H in gemistocytic, pilocytic and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas. Collectively considering, the present and our previous data, it appears that there is a spectrum of the expression levels of the epitope H ranging from the high expression in the reactive astrocytes and low grade astrocytomas to the low/null expression in the normal astrocytes and glioblastomas...|$|R
40|$|Serum JD from a 14 -year {{old girl}} with Sydenhams chorea {{contained}} antibodies which gave immunofluorescent staining of the limiting membrane of the brain, ependymal tissue and <b>fibrous</b> <b>astrocytes.</b> These antibodies could be completely absorbed by Str. pyogenes type 24 (NCTC 8305) but only partially {{if at all}} by type 6 matt (NCTC 8302) or type 6 glossy (NCTC 8709). In contrast, staining by the same serum of the choroid plexus, the periphery of hepatocytes, {{the periphery of the}} cells of the gastric mucosa, and tubules in the kidney could be absorbed out by the type 6 matt and type 24 strains (but not by the type 6 glossy or Staph. aureus NCTC 6571). A rabbit anti-streptococcal serum (3 / 74) raised against disintegrated washed cells of Str. pyogenes type 24 stained and the same structures in the brain to high titre, but not the choroid plexus and not the other structures stained by serum JD. These staining reactions of 3 / 74 could be absorbed out by Str. pyogenes type 24 but not by Str. pyogenes type 6 matt or type 6 glossy. None of these staining patterns given by serum JD or by 3 / 74 could be absorbed by human uterine smooth muscle. Serum 3 / 74 stained heart muscle but this reaction could be absorbed without affecting the brain staining reactions. Sera from 4 other patients with Sydenham's chorea were found to give staining of the ependyma and the limiting membrane, 2 only very weakly...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{molecular}} {{mechanism of}} K-Cl cotransport (KCC) consists {{of at least}} 4 isoforms, KCC 1, 2, 3, and 4 which, in multiple combinations, exist in most cells, including erythrocytes and neuronal cells. Methods: We utilized reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and ion flux studies to characterize KCC activity in an immortalized in vitro cell model for <b>fibrous</b> <b>astrocytes,</b> the rat C 6 glioblastoma cell. Isoform-specific sets of oligonucleotide primers were synthesized for NKCC 1, KCC 1, KCC 2, KCC 3, KCC 4, and also for NKCC 1 and actin. K-Cl cotransport activity was determined by measuring either the furosemide-sensitive, or the Cl [...] dependent bumetanide-insensitive Rb+ (a K+ congener) influx {{in the presence of}} the Na/K pump inhibitor ouabain. Rb+ influx was measured at a fixed external Cl concentrations, [Cl-]e, as a function of varying external Rb concentrations, [Rb+]e, and at a fixed [Rb+]e as a function of varying [Cl-]e, and with equimolar Cl replacement by anions of the chaotropic series. Results: RT-PCR of C 6 glioblastoma (C 6) cells identified mRNA for three KCC isoforms (1, 3, and 4). NKCC 1 mRNA was also detected. The apparent Km for KCC-mediated Rb+ influx was 15 mM [Rb+]e, and Vmax 12. 5 nmol Rb+ * mg protein- 1 * minute- 1. The calculated apparent Km for external Cl- was 13 mM and Vmax 14. 4 nmol Rb+ * mg protein- 1 * minute- 1. The anion selectivity sequence of the furosemide-sensitive Rb+ influx was Cl- 3 ̆e 3 ̆eBr-=NO 3 - 3 ̆eI-=SCN- 3 ̆e 3 ̆eSfm- (sulfamate). Established activators of K-Cl cotransport, hyposmotic shock and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) pretreatment, stimulated furosemide-sensitive Rb+ influx. A ñ 50...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} and biochemical diversity of neuroglial {{cells in the}} avian optic tectum were analyzed using immunohistochemical techniques. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were employed to define the distributions and localizations of four proteins that {{are considered to be}} glialspecific in the mammalian central nervous system: glutamine synthetase, carbonic anhydrase-C, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and S- 100 protein. The results showed the presence of at least three distinguishable populations of glia: glutamine synthetase/glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive <b>fibrous</b> <b>astrocytes,</b> glutamine synthetase/carbonic anhydrase-c-positive protoplasmic astrocytes, and S-IOO-positive oligodendroglia. In addition, a distinct population of neurons was observed that showed very intense immunostaining for the presence of carbonic anhydrase-C. The results suggest that the segregation of biochemical functions in the major categories of brain neuroglial cells (oligodendroglia and astroglia) varies significantly between vertebrate species. This observation raises the possibility of using comparative studies to refine our understanding of the roles that glial cells play in nervous tissue. Neural tissue of most organisms is extremely complex and is composed of myriads of different cells. In the simplest analysis, this cellular complexity can be subdivided into two major categories of cell types, the neuronal cells and the neuroglia. The neuronal cells are the conduits of electrical and chemical information transfer and, thus, are considered the functional units of the nervous system. Although neuroglia have been estimated to be the most numerous class of cells in the vertebrate nervous system (Glees, 1955), they have not been as intensively studied as neurons and, consequently, the functions of glia are less understood. In general, it is evident that the neuroglia are involved in a number of functions that relate to th...|$|R
40|$|When {{postnatal}} rat cerebellar {{cells were}} cultured in a chemically defined, serum-free medium, the only type of astrocyte (defined by {{the expression of}} the glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP) present was unable to accumulate gamma-[3 H]aminobutyric acid (GABA), did not express surface antigens recognized by two monoclonal antibodies, A 2 B 5 and LB 1, and showed minimal proliferation. In these cultures, nonneuronal A 2 B 5 +, LB 1 + stellate cells exhibiting "neuron-like" [3 H]GABA uptake formed cell colonies of increasing size and were GFAP-. After about one week of culturing, the A 2 B 5 +, LB 1 +, GABA-uptake positive cell groups became galactocerebroside (GalCer) positive. Immunocytolysis of the A 2 B 5 + cells at 3 and 4 days in vitro prevented the appearance of the A 2 B 5 +, LB 1 +, GABA-uptake positive cell colonies, and also of the GalCer+ cell groups. If 10 % (vol/vol) fetal calf serum was added to 6 -day cultures, the A 2 B 5 +, LB 1 +, GABA-uptake positive cell groups expressed GFAP and not GalCer. If the serum was added to the cultures 2 days after lysing the A 2 B 5 + cells, only A 2 B 5 -, LB 1 -, GABA-uptake negative astrocytes proliferated. It is concluded that the putative <b>fibrous</b> <b>astrocytes</b> previously described in serum-containing cultures (which had a stellate shape and were A 2 B 5 +, LB 1 +, GABA-uptake positive) derive from bipotential precursors that differentiate into oligodendrocytes (GalCer+) in serum-free medium or into astrocytes (GFAP+) in the presence of serum, while the epithelioid A 2 B 5 -, LB 1 -, GABA-uptake negative astrocytes originate from a different precursor not yet identified...|$|R
40|$|Adrenal {{grafting}} for Parkinson's {{disease has}} led to modest functional improvement despite poor graft survival. One explanation is a neurotrophic response within the traumatized striatum. This study was undertaken to investigate {{the time course of}} the astrocytic response in vivo and in vitro, and the expression of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) mRNA following striatal injury. Unilateral stereotaxic biopsy of the rat striatum was performed and gelatin sponge (gel-foam) was immediately placed into the biopsy cavity. Rats were sacrificed on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 28 post biopsy. Immunohistochemical staining of the traumatized striatum with antibodies to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was carried out. The reactive astrocytes which appeared within 7 days after trauma were mostly protoplasmic on the basis of morphology, and maximal on day 7, being 30 times the level in the normal striatum. After day 7, <b>fibrous</b> <b>astrocytes</b> appeared and increased up to day 28, while protoplasmic astrocytes decreased. In addition, immunocytochemical double staining of short term cultured astrocytes from the traumatized striatum with anti-A 2 B 5 and anti-GFAP antibodies revealed that 84 % and 90 % of astrocytes were type 1 astrocytes on days 3 and 7, respectively; however, by day 28 47 % of astrocytes were type 2. Northern blot analysis revealed that CNTF mRNA expression was up-regulated and peaked on day 7, coincident with a predominance of protoplasmic astrocytes in vivo and type 1 astrocytes in vitro, respectively. These findings suggest that the expression of CNTF mRNA is part of the early astrocytic response to trauma, particularly associated with protoplasmic astrocytes in vivo and type 1 astrocytes in vitro. We conclude that reactive astrocytes are likely candidates to produce the neurite promoting activity seen in previous studies after trauma in the striatum. CNTF may represent an early signal in the astrocyte-mediated neurotrophic and neurite promoting responses...|$|R
