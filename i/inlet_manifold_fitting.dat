S., Mechanical Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2012 Fuel {{combustion}} {{inside the}} cylinder of an engine is greatly {{affected by the}} mixing {{of the air and}} the fuel. Better mixing leads to more efficient combustion. There {{has been a lot of}} research in the past to improve the mixing of air fuel mixture in the engine. Better mixing can be achieved by modifying the designs of <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold</b> or piston head grove etc. In this Thesis the focus is on <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold.</b> This thesis compares three designs of <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold</b> for combustion efficiency achieved by them. Those designs are helical <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold,</b> spiral <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold,</b> helical-spiral <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold.</b> 			Star CCM+ is used as a tool to model these three <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold</b> designs, cylinder and a piston. Same tool is used to do the analysis for combustion efficiency using some boundary conditions. Stoichiometric equation was given to the program to do the calculations. CO, CO 2, NO, H 2, N 2, H 20, temperature and pressure were chosen as the results that the program should give out once the calculation is done. The comparison of these results for all the three designs would recommend the best design among three designs of <b>inlet</b> <b>manifolds.</b> 			When compared, among three, Helical-Spiral <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold</b> design stood the best. It had the fewer amounts of Carbon Monoxide, more Carbon Di-oxide and more Nitrous Oxide. Having more Nitrous Oxide in the exhaust gases is contradicting the thesis; however the reasons and remedies for that problem are addressed in the conclusions section. Also Helical-Spiral design had higher pressure and temperatures generated inside the cylinder than other two designs. So Helical-Spiral <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold</b> design is suggested as the best design among the three. Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Water flow {{tests with}} {{circumferential}} <b>inlet</b> and outlet <b>manifolds</b> {{were conducted to}} determine factors affecting fluid distribution and pressure losses. Various orifice sizes and manifold geometries were tested over a range of flow velocities. With <b>inlet</b> <b>manifolds,</b> flow distribution was related directly to orifice discharge coefficients. A correlation indicated that nonuniform distribution resulted when the velocity head ratio at the orifice {{was not in the}} range of constant discharge coefficient. With outlet manifolds, nonuniform flow was related to static pressure variations along the manifold. Outlet manifolds had appreciably greater pressure losses than comparable <b>inlet</b> <b>manifolds.</b> Includes bibliographical references (p. 25).

50|$|Most {{automobiles}} use four-stroke Otto cycle engines {{with multiple}} cylinders {{attached to a}} single <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold.</b> During the induction stroke, the piston descends in the cylinder and the intake valve is open. As the piston descends it effectively increases the volume in the cylinder above it, setting up low pressure. Atmospheric pressure pushes air through the manifold and carburetor or fuel injection system, where it is mixed with fuel. Because multiple cylinders operate at different times in the engine cycle, there is almost constant pressure difference through the <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold</b> from carburetor to engine.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{have studied}} the {{traditional}} Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV) valve equipment. Then we have improved the system by adding ventilation equipment. We have applied this kind of connection equipment on gas engine which has no PCV. This can determine the engine fuel-air ratio and make the engine get the best power performance, economical efficiency and emission behavior. Because emission amount is based on input air amount, so how to control the input air amount {{is the basis of}} the whole system. On the basis of traditional <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold</b> MVEM, we have considered the affection of PCV system, and we have simulated the actual input air process by getting improved module’s input air amount and <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold</b> pressure parameters. So the fuel-air ratio precision can be increased greatly. We also have prompted some improving directions about traditional <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold.</b> So we can ensure that engine can get a compact structure and good response on the all operation states...|$|R

50|$|BL {{had also}} {{developed}} the earlier R-Series engine from the E-Series family, but {{largely as a}} stopgap at the Maestro's launch since the S-Series was not yet ready for production. Because the E-Series had to be turned through 180 degrees {{in order to facilitate}} an end-on transmission, the resultant R-Series unit had the <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold</b> on the front-facing side of the cylinder head, something which proved fatal for the engine's reliability - since it opened the door for carburettor icing. The S-Series solved this problem, as the <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold</b> was now on the rear face of the engine. Another important advance over the E-/R-Series was the adoption of a camshaft driven by a toothed belt in place of the previous timing chain system.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a locality-constrained and sparsity-encouraged <b>manifold</b> <b>fitting</b> approach, aiming at {{capturing}} the locally sparse manifold structure into neighborhood graph construction by exploiting a principled optimization model. The proposed model formulates neighborhood graph construction as a sparse coding {{problem with the}} locality constraint, therefore achieving simultaneous neighbor selection and edge weight optimization. The core idea underlying our model is to perform a sparse <b>manifold</b> <b>fitting</b> task for each data point so that close-by points lying on the same local manifold are automatically chosen to connect and meanwhile the connection weights are acquired by simple geometric reconstruction. We term the novel neighborhood graph generated by our proposed optimization model M-Fitted Graph since such a graph stems from sparse <b>manifold</b> <b>fitting.</b> To evaluate the robustness and effectiveness of M-fitted graphs, we leverage graph-based semisupervised learning as the testbed. Extensive experiments carried out on six benchmark datasets validate that the proposed M-fitted graph is superior to state-of-the-art neighborhood graphs in terms of classification accuracy using popular graph-based semi-supervised learning methods. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Internal {{combustion}} engines in now a days {{is the best}} available reliable source of power for all domestic, large scale industrial and transportation applications. The major issue arises at the efficiency of these engines. Every attempt made to improve these engines tends to attain the maximum efficiency. The performances of the diesel engines are enhanced by proper design of <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold,</b> exhaust manifold, combustion chamber, piston etc. The study is {{about the effect of}} piston configurations on in- cylinder flow. Here a single cylinder direct injection diesel engine is used for study. For obtaining swirl intensity helicalspiral combination <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold</b> is used. Increase in swirl intensity results in better mixing of fuel and air. Swirl Velocities in the charge can be substantially increased during compression by suitable design of the piston. In the present work, a study on the effect of different piston configuration on air motion and turbulence inside the cylinder of a Direct Injection (DI) diesel is carried out using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code Fluent 13.
