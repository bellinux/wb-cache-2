5|$|On , 1889, the Land Run saw the {{founding}} of Norman, with at least 150 residents spending the night in makeshift campsites; {{by the next morning}} a downtown was already being constructed. Almost immediately two prominent Norman businessmen, former Purcell railroad freight agent Delbert Larsh and railroad station chief cashier Thomas Waggoner, began lobbying for the territorial government to locate its first university in Norman. The two were interested in growing the city and had reasoned that, rather than try to influence legislatures to locate the heavily contested territory capital in Norman, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> to attempt to secure the state's first university instead (a move that would be far less controversial). On , 1890, Larsh and Waggoner were successful with the passage of Council Bill 114, establishing the University of Oklahoma in Norman approximately 18 years before Oklahoma statehood.|$|E
5|$|Eshiro {{said that}} they could have set the game in a {{courtroom}} {{similar to that of the}} main series and made a few additions, but that it would not have been very interesting; instead they moved the game to crime scenes, and added several new gameplay elements. Yamazaki was the one who came up with the idea of making a game about deductive reasoning and crime scene investigation. Because of this theme, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> to them to include the Ace Attorney character Ema Skye in the game, as she is portrayed as wanting to be a forensic scientist. Yamazaki originally suggested that Ema should be the main character, but based on fan feedback, they decided to use the more popular character Miles Edgeworth instead. Figuring out how to move the game from the courtroom to the crime scene was a challenge for the development team. The team also thought that it was difficult to make the game feel new while also making sure it felt similar to the game series. Because of the new gameplay systems that all had to be created from scratch, Ace Attorney Investigations took longer to develop than previous Ace Attorney games had.|$|E
5000|$|Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "The demo to {{that was}} called [...] "Boom B3". We played {{a version of}} it, and then it got re-arranged." [...] Drummer Matt Cameron on the song:There weren't any lyrics when we tracked it, so {{we did what we}} thought would be a good, tight {{instrumental}} version that would later have vocals on it. When we tracked it, I was like, [...] "Huh? What's this?" [...] <b>It</b> <b>made</b> no <b>sense</b> to me. But then when the vocals were added, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> perfect <b>sense</b> and <b>it</b> elevated the entire piece.|$|R
50|$|Below is {{the list}} of {{students}} batches and name. (Due to the various intake positions in the programme, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> more <b>sense</b> to list the batches according to their respective graduation year, instead of intake year).|$|R
50|$|There {{was also}} another house, that was brown in color, called Kuruvilla {{that was later}} disbanded and {{students}} were distributed amongst the houses available since <b>it</b> <b>made</b> more <b>sense</b> to have four houses {{in order to keep}} competitions easier.|$|R
5|$|The French {{scientists}} {{made good}} {{progress on the}} design of an aqueous homogeneous reactor, but there were doubts that their work was relevant to the main task of the British Tube Alloys project, that of building an atomic bomb, and resources were tightly controlled in wartime Britain. There was a possibility that a reactor could be used to breed plutonium, but its use in a bomb seemed a remote possibility. The MAUD Committee therefore felt that they should relocate to America. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> to pool resources, and America had advantages, notably access to materials such as heavy water. American scientists such as Henry D. Smyth, Harold Urey and Hugh Taylor urged that the Cambridge team be sent to America. On the other hand, American officials had concerns about security, since only one of the six senior scientists in the Cambridge group was British, and about French patent claims. These included patents on controlling nuclear chain reactions, enriching uranium, and using deuterium as a neutron moderator. There were also two patent applications in conjunction with Egon Bretscher and Norman Feather on the production and use of plutonium. George Thomson, the chairman of the MAUD Committee, suggested a compromise: relocating the team to Canada.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1991, however, falling {{inflation}} {{had reduced}} WMATA's construction costs {{so much that}} the agency said it could build the two final Green Line stations in Prince George's County without asking Congress for additional money. WMATA also proposed spending money almost three times faster up-front to accelerate its construction schedule, a move which would be more than compensated for by savings in out-years. Prince George's County officials threatened to block all further Metrorail construction unless they received guarantees that the stations in their county would be built. Funding for the remaining seven Green Line stations in the District and Prince George's remained in doubt as of August 1991, with District officials saying that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> to build the Georgia Avenue – Petworth and Columbia Heights stations and Prince George's representatives demanding that the three stations in their county be completed. WMATA said that it had so little money it could not fund 16 critical small construction projects, among them security gates at the Navy Yard and Waterfront stations and parts for escalators at the seven new Green Line stations in D.C. and Prince George's County. The funding impasse was broken in November 1991 when local and state governments agreed to roughly triple their contribution to Metro's construction costs by 1994 to complete the entire system.|$|E

50|$|The {{play was}} {{originally}} performed in Harrogate in 1955, but was heavily {{cut by the}} Lord Chamberlain's office, who objected to the homosexual undercurrents in the play. The production was largely panned by critics, as <b>it</b> <b>made</b> little <b>sense</b> after the censor's cuts.|$|R

25|$|Though Current TV {{had large}} {{distribution}} throughout the United States on {{cable and satellite}} television, it averaged only 28,000 viewers at any time. The acquisition of Current TV by Al Jazeera allowed Time Warner Cable to drop the network due to its low ratings, but they released {{a statement saying that}} they would consider carrying the channel after they evaluated whether <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> for their customers. Time Warner Cable later began carrying Al Jazeera America in December 2013.|$|E
25|$|The {{business}} {{was bought by}} the United Steel Companies Limited (USC) on 29 June 1945. USC needed replacement locomotives so <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> to buy a manufacturer (at the right price) and the idea had been put forward of developing a central engineering workshop for their steelworks at Templeborough (Rotherham) and Stocksbridge. Both works were being expanded and redeveloped, and were easily accessible by rail from the YEC works. In the post war climate, the YEC management were willing to sell.|$|E
25|$|During {{this early}} period of growth, Dome {{proposed}} {{to build a}} liquids recovery plant — in effect, a very large straddle plant — at the Empress, Alberta, delivery point to the TransCanada transmission line. The Empress plant sits just inside the Alberta/Saskatchewan border. This is for reasons related to both politics and infrastructure. Politically, Alberta wanted value to be added inside provincial borders. As importantly, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> to extract liquids before sending the dry gas that remained - unadulterated methane - into the export market.|$|E
5000|$|New Zealand's {{economy was}} heavily {{dependent}} on overseas trade, and Prime Minister Norman Kirk felt that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> little <b>sense</b> {{to be dependent on}} foreign-owned shipping firms. A state-owned shipping line, Shipping Corporation of New Zealand was created, but was to be financially unsuccessful.|$|R

"When {{we decided}} to make an anime {{adaptation}} of the comic book, I couldn't see how a traditional animated approach would do justice to Anna's incredibly lush and detailed illustrations. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> perfect <b>sense</b> to adapt the medium to suit her art, rather than vice versa." ...|$|R
5000|$|The studio {{version of}} [...] "Bad" [...] was criticised as being [...] "unfinished", [...] "fuzzy" [...] and [...] "unfocused", but the band found that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> more <b>sense</b> on stage.

25|$|For us {{the real}} {{revolution}} in critical theory...was heralded by the publication, in 1938, of Understanding Poetry...for {{many of us}} who were preparing ourselves to teach English is those years....this book...came as a kind of revelation. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> because it opened up for us a way of talking about an actual poem in an actual classroom, and because the technique of focusing upon a poem as language rather than as history or biography or morality, gave a whole new meaning to and justification for the teaching of poetry (qtd. in Singh 1991).|$|E
25|$|Bill Hamilton was {{a solitary}} man who saw {{everything}} {{through the lens}} of Darwin's theory of evolution. When he wanted to know why some ants and humans give up their life for others, he went to Waterloo station and stared at humans for hours, looking for patterns. In 1963, he realised that most of the behaviours of humans were due to genes, and he began looking at humans from the genes' point of view. Humans were machines that were only important for carrying genes, and <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> for a gene to sacrifice a human if it meant that another copy of the gene elsewhere could prosper.|$|E
25|$|Freddie Ross {{worked as}} his {{publicist}} from 1954, and became {{more involved in}} his life, eventually becoming his mistress. He divorced Cicely in 1965, and married Ross in December of that year. This second marriage was short-lived. During these years, Hancock was also involved with Joan Le Mesurier (née Malin), the new wife of actor John Le Mesurier, Hancock's best friend and a regular supporting character-actor from his television series. Joan was later to describe the relationship in her book Lady Don't Fall Backwards, including the claim that her husband readily forgave the affair; {{if it had been}} anyone else, he is quoted as saying, he wouldn't have understood it, but with Tony Hancock, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense.</b> In July 1966, Freddie took an overdose, but survived. Arriving in Blackpool to record an edition of his variety series, Hancock was met by pressmen asking about his wife's attempted suicide. The final dissolution of the marriage took place a few days ahead of Hancock's own suicide.|$|E

25|$|Morey {{demonstrated}} his {{engine in}} New York and Philadelphia {{and there are}} eyewitness reports for both. In Philadelphia, he demonstrated it powering a boat and a wagon. Unfortunately, {{when he decided to}} demonstrate the car on the street, he fell off after starting the engine and the vehicle powered across Market Street into a ditch. This was the second car ride in the world, and the first in the United States. Despite these mostly successful demonstrations, Morey could not find a buyer, and became frustrated. A letter from Reverend Dana of Orford written in October 1829 tells of Morey’s trip to Baltimore, “I am told, the Capt. Is determined to make one more vigorous effort, to sell his patent right for some of his modern inventions , and if he does not now succeed, he will give the matter up, and return to Orford, to spend his days in quiet.” Morey did not find a buyer, and as he was then in his late 60s, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> to stop traveling {{up and down the east}} coast and call it quits.|$|E
500|$|However, other songs contain {{subject matter}} and themes more typical of Green Day's {{previous}} work. Armstrong wrote [...] "Nice Guys Finish Last" [...] about the band's interactions with the band's lawyers and managers and how [...] "everybody thinks they know what's best for you." [...] "Jinx" [...] contains self-deprecating lyrics characteristic {{of many of the}} band's songs, while [...] "Prosthetic Head" [...] has been referred to as a [...] "typical ticked-off kiss-off". [...] "King for a Day" [...] {{tells the story of a}} cross-dresser. [...] "Uptight" [...] contains repeated mentions of suicide; Armstrong explained, [...] "I think the word 'suicide' just sounded really good. And the line, 'I'm a son of a gun'. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense,</b> but I can't really explain why <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense.</b> It just sort of does." ...|$|E
500|$|Chandler left a last {{statement}} with prison officials {{on a piece}} of paper, which was read aloud during a news conference after the execution. It said: [...] "You are killing a (sic) innocent man today." [...] Shortly after signing Chandler's death warrant Governor Rick Scott said: [...] " [...] killed three women, so I looked through different cases, and <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> to do that one. There's never one thing. It was the right case." ...|$|E
50|$|Control Ciudadano, a Venezuelan NGO, {{stated that}} <b>it</b> <b>made</b> no <b>sense</b> that an {{aircraft}} {{taking off from}} a military base had not been intercepted after abandoning its flight plan.

[...] Tilbrook noted that the [...] "ending was Costello's idea, and he played the piano part accompanying it." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>It</b> {{therefore}} <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> {{that when}} Dr Price endowed the institute at Wits and asked Broom {{who should be}} appointed to go out fossil-hunting, Broom had no hesitation in recommending James Kitching. Immediately on his return from active service in Italy {{at the end of}} World War II, the 23-year-old Kitching was appointed the first and only member of staff of the fledgling institute.|$|R
500|$|Like {{the pilot}} episode, [...] "The Transformation" [...] begins on the {{passenger}} section of an airplane in flight. Actor Mark Valley was asked how the episode differed from the pilot, leading him to joke that [...] "it's a completely different airline this time." [...] His character, John Scott, was first seen in an episode about a plane disaster; accordingly, IGN expressed, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> thematically to have his last appearance be in an episode about a similar type of disaster. The Los Angeles Times viewed the flight number of 718 and its subsequent crash as a nod to co-creator J.J. Abrams' other series, Lost.|$|E
500|$|Creators Murphy and Falchuk {{began working}} on American Horror Story before their Fox series Glee began production. Murphy {{wanted to do the}} {{opposite}} of what he had done previously and thus began his work on the series. He stated, [...] "I went from Nip/Tuck to Glee, so <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> that I wanted to do something challenging and dark. And I always had loved, as Brad had, the horror genre. So it just was a natural for me." [...] Falchuk was intrigued by the idea of putting a different angle on the horror genre, stating that their main goal in creating the series was to scare viewers. [...] "You want people {{to be a little bit}} off balance afterwards," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|In 1873, Congress {{had passed}} a Coinage Act that {{regulated}} which coins were legal tender. [...] The list of legal coins duplicated {{that of the}} previous coinage act, leaving off only the silver dollar and three smaller coins. [...] The rationale in the Treasury report accompanying the draft bill was that to mint a gold dollar and a silver dollar with different intrinsic values was problematic; as the silver dollar did not circulate and the gold did, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> to drop the unused coin. The bill passed easily, with Bayard's support, but quickly thereafter became unpopular. [...] Opponents of the bill would later call this omission the [...] "Crime of '73," [...] and would mean it literally, circulating tales of bribery of Congressmen by foreign agents.|$|E
