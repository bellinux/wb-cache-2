5|$|In 1887, {{eighteen}} {{years after the}} rift formed in the American women's rights movement, Stone proposed a merger of the two groups. Plans were drawn up, and, at their annual meetings, propositions were heard and voted on, then passed to the other group for <b>evaluation.</b> <b>By</b> 1890, the organizations resolved their differences and merged to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). Stone was too weak with heart problems and respiratory illness to attend its first convention but was elected chair of the executive committee. Stanton {{was president of the}} new organization, but Anthony, who had the title of vice president, was its leader in practice.|$|E

5|$|Upon U-1s completion, the Austro-Hungarian Navy {{conducted}} {{trials of}} the submarine throughout most of 1910. On 5 April both of U-1s electric motors were damaged in a flooding incident during her trials. U-1s gasoline engines {{were never able to}} meet the speed called for in the contract during the Navy evaluations, and were considered not suitable for wartime use. As a result, the Navy only paid for U-1s hull and armament, and arranged a lease of the gasoline engines while replacement diesel engines were ordered from the Austrian firm Maschinenfabrik Leobersdorf.

5|$|Curing {{the leaks}} and {{cleaning}} up the contamination delayed the tunnel's completion by a year, and it was finally opened on 22 August 1999. The entire process was further complicated by conflicts between NSB Gardermobanen and the Scandinavian Rock Group. Retrospective surveys showed a lack of control and reporting procedures during the incidents, which should have been addressed in 1995, but were never taken seriously. Compensation was paid for approximately 60 houses which were damaged {{as a result of}} tunnel construction. An <b>evaluation</b> <b>by</b> the Ministry of Transport and Communications showed that NOK500 million was spent fixing the leaks, but the report claimed that this was to a large extent a waste of money, resulting from inefficient engineering procedures. The same report criticized the planning and organization of the construction of the entire railway. In total the extraordinary additional costs for the tunnel totaled NOK1.3 billion.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy {{selected}} the Sea King {{to meet a}} requirement for an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopter to replace the Westland Wessex, placing an order with Westland for 60 SH-3D Sea Kings in June 1966. The prototype and three pre-production aircraft were built by Sikorsky at Stratford, Connecticut and shipped to the United Kingdom to act as trials and pattern aircraft. The first of the SH-3Ds was initially fitted with General Electric T58s and, after being shipped from the United States, was flown in October 1966 from the dockside at Avonmouth to Yeovil airfield. The other three were delivered from the docks, by road to Yeovil, for completion with British systems and Rolls-Royce Gnome engines. The first Westland-built helicopter, designated Sea King HAS1, flew on 7 May 1969 at Yeovil. The first two helicopters were used for trials and <b>evaluation</b> <b>by</b> Westland and the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment; subsequent production Sea Kings were delivered to the Royal Navy's 700 Naval Air Squadron from August 1969 onwards.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine to what extent two types of {{evaluations}} are similar: course <b>evaluations</b> <b>by</b> students and that by the teacher for the same class. Seventy-nine students who took a particular class and the teacher of the class were required to evaluate each lecture throughout one semester. The results showed that there was a difference between the variances of students' evaluations and the variances of the teacher's evaluations over the semester. However, the tendencies of both evaluations were similar for many individual lectures. Furthermore, a significant correlation was found between the two types of evaluations. These findings indicate that course <b>evaluations</b> <b>by</b> the students might be generally analogous to the <b>evaluations</b> <b>by</b> the class's teacher...|$|R

5|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{complexities of}} RAD mean that careful diagnostic <b>evaluation</b> <b>by</b> a trained mental health expert with particular expertise in differential diagnosis is considered essential. Several other disorders, such as conduct disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, post traumatic stress disorder and social phobia share many symptoms {{and are often}} comorbid with or confused with RAD, leading to over and under diagnosis. RAD can also be confused with neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, pervasive developmental disorder, childhood schizophrenia and some genetic syndromes. Infants with this disorder can be distinguished from those with organic illness by their rapid physical improvement after hospitalization. Autistic children {{are likely to be}} of normal size and weight and often exhibit a degree of intellectual disability. They are unlikely to improve upon being removed from the home.|$|E
5|$|There {{were more}} {{concerns}} about Clannad being similar to Air. When Nagisa's scenario was being written, {{there were some}} disputes concerning {{the length of her}} scenario, and thus putting too much focus on the main heroine. Some were concerned that having a single prominent character with a unique storyline would be too much like how Air was structured with the overall focus on Misuzu Kamio. Takahiro Baba, the company president of VisualArt's, is even noted as suggesting to minimize the differences between the other characters' scenarios, but this was ultimately ignored since Maeda thought the game's <b>evaluation</b> <b>by</b> players would not decrease on account of the scenarios being vastly different, and thought the end result was a good one. Maeda was concerned that the After Story arc, mainly a continuation of Nagisa's scenario, would eclipse the entire game's scenario, much like what happened with Air according to Maeda. In order to prevent the same thing happening in Clannad, Maeda focused on making {{the first half of the}} story, the School Life arc, just as enjoyable by making it long and heart-breaking. Clannad is Key's second longest work, as reported by YÅ«to Tonokawa where he stated that Clannad is about 4,000 words fewer than Key's 2008 game Little Busters! Ecstasy.|$|E
5|$|Vaseegaran prepares Chitti for an <b>evaluation</b> <b>by</b> the Artificial Intelligence Research and Development (AIRD) Institute, {{which is}} headed by Bohra. During the evaluation, Chitti {{attempts}} to stab Vaseegaran at Bohra's command, which convinces the evaluation committee that the robot is a liability and cannot be used for military purposes. Vaseegaran's effort to prove Bohra wrong fails when he deploys Chitti to rescue people from a burning building. The robot saves most of them, including a girl named Selvi who was bathing at the time, but she is ashamed at being seen naked on camera and flees, only to be hit and killed by a truck. Vaseegaran asks for one month to modify Chitti's neural schema to enable it to understand human behaviour and emotions, to which Bohra agrees. While nearing the deadline, Chitti becomes angry with Vaseegaran, demonstrating to him that it can manifest emotions.|$|E
