40|$|The {{objective}} of the research to be pursued {{is to develop a}} schema for representing raster-digitized (scanned) documents, The representation is to retain not only the spatial structure of a printed document, but should also facilitate automatic labeling of various components, such as text, figures, subtitles, and figure captions, and allow the extraction of important relationships (such as reading order) among them. Intended applications include (1) data compression for document transmission and archival, and (2) <b>document</b> <b>entry,</b> with out rekeying, into editing, formatting, and information retrieval systems...|$|R
40|$|Efficiently {{growing a}} group or firm often {{requires}} integration of individuals from lower-performing entities. We explore the effectiveness of two policies intended to facilitate such integration, using a laboratory experiment that models production as a coordination game with Pareto-ranked equilibria. We initially create an efficient group and an inefficient one. We then allow individuals {{to move into the}} high-performing group and vary by treatment whether movement is unrestricted, limited to one entrant per period, or subject to an entry exam. We include two additional treatments that combine the two restrictions in different ways to help understand why the institutions are effective in maintaining coordination. We find that both restrictions work to maintain efficient coordination but they are effective for different reasons. Growth, <b>entry,</b> <b>coordination,</b> experiments...|$|R

The book belongs to the genre of instructional manuals, marketed for the growing business and middle classes of late 16th century England, and was extremely popular, going into as many as ten editions by 1635, and becoming the most influential correspondence manual of its time.

50|$|Azerbaijan. Until 1997, {{the entry}} regime between Azerbaijan and Russia wasn't {{established}} legally. Azerbaijani citizens {{could stay in}} Russia, without visas, with all types of documents indefinitely, subject {{to the rules of}} internal migration. These conditions were legally enshrined in the agreement on visa-free trips of citizens of 3 July 1997. The unlimited period was canceled 1 November 2002, and replaced by a 90-day limit. A protocol to the agreement of 2 February 2005 adjusted the list of accepted <b>documents.</b> <b>Entry</b> with internal passports was prohibited. Starting from 1 January 2014, for all foreigners, a limit of 90 days within any 180 day period was introduced.|$|R
40|$|We <b>document</b> <b>entry</b> and {{capacity}} expansion in US long-distance fiber-optic networks {{before and during}} the "telecom boom. " We disentangle the many swaps and leases between networks in order to measure owned route miles versus route miles shared with other carriers. Entry appears much more moderate when these shared miles are not counted. Preemption strategies can lead to excessive entry, and we find evidence for preemptive behavior regarding total miles (including swaps and leases) but less for preemption regarding owned miles. We conclude that entry was excessive only with regard to swaps and leases, but not with regard to the physical building of the networks. ...|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately, {{it appears}} that any plans to conduct {{additional}} investigations were abandoned around the time bank construction was completed. The final reference to additional excavation occurs in 1976, when Bob Ferguson wrote that he was “certain {{much remains to be}} discovered when work resumes in the cavern, so thoughtfully preserved by the First American National Bank.” In 1978, a group of cavers from the Nashville Grotto visited the site but were underwhelmed by the lack of intact cavern or open passages.

40|$|Auction {{design with}} {{endogenous}} entry {{is complicated by}} <b>entry</b> <b>coordination</b> among bidders due to multiple entry equilibria issue. This article studies auction design when information acquisition costs are private information of bidders. We show that this problem can be resolved by sufficient dispersion in these costs. First, we find that a simple second-price auction with no entry fee and a reserve price equal to the seller's valuation is ex ante efficient, while a revenue-maximizing auction involves personalized entry fees, which {{are determined by the}} hazard rates of their information acquisition cost distribution. Second, we show that sufficient dispersion in the information acquisition costs (more dispersion than a particular uniform distribution by the Bickel-Lehman dispersive order) can coordinate bidders and implement uniquely the desirable entry. The dispersion in information acquisition costs is also necessary for this "unique implementation" result. " ("JEL" D 44, D 82) Copyright (c) 2009 Western Economic Association International. ...|$|R
40|$|Neutrally buoyant {{helium-filled}} soap bubbles with laser illumination {{are used}} to <b>document</b> <b>entry</b> flow separation for oscillating flow in tubes. For a symmetric entry case, {{the size of the}} separation zone appears to mildly depend on Reynolds number in the acceleration phase, but is roughly Reynolds number independent in the deceleration phase. For the asymmetric entry case, the separation zone was larger and appeared to grow somewhat during the deceleration phase. The separation zones for both entry geometry cases remain relatively small throughout the cycle. This is different from what would be observed in all-laminar, oscillator flows and is probably due to the high turbulence of the flow, particularly during the deceleration phase of the cycle...|$|R

It was produced on a princely scale, catching Leo at the peak of his reputation, en route to a meeting at Bologna with François I, at the head of temporarily victorious forces. Ciseri identifies two likely candidates for the allegorical programme, Jacopo Nardi and Marcello Virgilio Adriani, and a theme that offered parallel evocations of Imperial Rome the heavenly Jerusalem. The unfinished façade of the Duomo was temporarily [...] "completed" [...] in [...] "chiaroscuro" [...] (grisaille) canvases of feigned architecture and sculpture by Andrea del Sarto to designs by Jacopo Sansovino.|$|R
