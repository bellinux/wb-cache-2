40|$|Abstract. The {{automatic}} scheduling is {{not suitable}} for manufacture in most case, because it cannot fully utilize {{the experience of the}} operator and effectively response the disturbance events from the production progress. In order to solve these problems the manual scheduling technology using the pattern of human-computer collaborative is proposed. The graphical scheduling block has been discrete through applying the kernel methods including the combination of multi-layer displaying of Gantt-Chart, the model of machine calendar, mouse selected mechanism and auxiliary function for manual scheduling. By building multi-layer normative modular manual scheduling operations, we divide the manual scheduling operation into three steps: the selection of manual scheduling process, the selection of the inserting base, and the <b>inserting</b> <b>mode.</b> At the same time constrains transferring mode provoked by the three kinds of <b>inserting</b> <b>mode</b> is analyzed. By controlling constrains in the progress of the manual adjustment makes sure that the manual scheduling result meets the demand of job shop production. Finally, the algorithms in this paper are validated by the software developed with C++...|$|R

5000|$|... vi is a modal editor: it {{operates}} in either <b>insert</b> <b>mode</b> (where typed text {{becomes part of}} the document) or normal mode (where keystrokes are interpreted as commands that control the edit session). For example, typing [...] while in normal mode switches the editor to <b>insert</b> <b>mode,</b> but typing [...] again at this point places an [...] "i" [...] character in the document. From <b>insert</b> <b>mode,</b> pressing [...] switches the editor back to normal mode. A perceived advantage of vi's separation of text entry and command modes is that both text editing and command operations can be performed without requiring the removal of the user's hands from the home row. As non-modal editors usually have to reserve all keys with letters and symbols for the printing of characters, any special commands for actions other than adding text to the buffer must be assigned to keys that do not produce characters, such as function keys, or combinations of modifier keys such as , and [...] with regular keys. Vi has the property that most ordinary keys are connected to some kind of command for positioning, altering text, searching and so forth, either singly or in key combinations. Many commands can be touch typed without the use of [...] or [...] Other types of editors generally require the user to move their hands from the home row when touch typing: ...|$|E
