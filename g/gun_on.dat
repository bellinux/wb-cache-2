5|$|Broke drilled {{his crew}} to an {{extremely}} {{high standard of}} naval gunnery; he regularly had them fire at targets, such as floating barrels. Often these drills would be made into competitions to see which gun crew could hit the target and how fast they could do so. He even had his gun crews fire at targets 'blindfold' to good effect; they were only given the bearing to lay their <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> without being allowed to sight the <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> the target themselves. This constituted a very early example of 'director firing'.|$|E
5|$|Her {{anti-aircraft}} armament {{consisted of}} a single QF 3 inch 20 cwt AA <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> a high-angle MKII mount at the aft end of the superstructure that was carried from July 1915. A 3-pounder Hotchkiss <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> a high-angle MkIc mounting with a maximum elevation of 60° was also mounted in November 1914 and used until August 1917. A 4-inch BL MK VII on a high-angle mount was added in April 1917. Five 18-inch (450mm) submerged torpedo tubes were fitted on the Invincibles, two on each side {{and one in the}} stern. Fourteen torpedoes were carried for them.|$|E

5000|$|Invincible {{was one of}} {{the first}} trio of a new and longer type of 74-gun ships. Until 1738, French 74s had been little more than 154 (French) feet in gundeck length, {{carrying}} just thirteen pairs of 36-pdr <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the lower deck, fourteen pairs of 18-pdr <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the upper deck and eight pairs of 8-pdr <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the quarterdeck and forecastle, with the balance of the 74 guns made up of four small 4-pdr <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the poop.|$|R
5|$|At the Miles family home, Billy, now highly suspicious, {{enters and}} pulls his <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> {{the man who}} appears to be his father. After the confrontation, Billy relinquishes his gun, at which point the other man {{physically}} morphs and reveals himself to be the Alien Bounty Hunter. At that point, Mulder and Scully pull up and walk into the house, unable to locate Billy or his father.|$|E
5|$|Indefatigable {{received}} a single QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> a high-angle Mark II mount in March 1915. It was provided with 500 rounds. All of her 4-inch guns were enclosed in casemates and given gun shields during a refit in November 1915 to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action, although two aft guns were removed {{at the same}} time.|$|E
5|$|The {{modified}} castle {{was completed}} by 1808, and held eight 24-pounder (11kg) guns along the outer wall, a <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> {{the roof of the}} southern bastion, and another on top of the keep itself. The new castle could hold a garrison of 40 men.|$|E
50|$|Biskvito: {{appears in}} episode 38. Powers include flight, {{a pair of}} laser <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> each wing, and four machine <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the nose.|$|R
2500|$|All three {{ships were}} armed with two 32-pounder (50 cwt) smoothbore muzzle-loading <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> truck mounts and two [...] (65 cwt) smoothbore muzzle-loading shell <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> {{pivoting}} mounts.|$|R

5|$|The ship's {{original}} armament {{consisted of}} a single Bofors 40 mm D70 gun mounted on the ship's bow, a quadruple Strela 2 launcher behind the bridge and a quad 20mm M-75 <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> the stern. Eight MDB-MT3 depth charges could be carried for anti-submarine warfare duties. Located on the sides were two double-barrel 128mm illumination launchers. Sensors included a Racal Decca RM 1216 A surface search radar and a Simrad SQ 3D/SF sonar.|$|E
5|$|A lighter {{alternative}} to the turret, particularly popular with the French navy, was the barbette. These were fixed armored towers which held a <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> a turntable. The crew was sheltered from direct fire, but vulnerable to plunging fire, for instance from shore emplacements. The barbette was lighter than the turret, needing less machinery and no roof armor—though nevertheless some barbettes were stripped of their armor plate to reduce the top-weight of their ships. The barbette became widely adopted in the 1880s, and {{with the addition of}} an armored 'gun-house', transformed into the turrets of the pre-Dreadnought battleships.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1937, {{there was}} an effort to equip many tanks with a second machine gun {{in the rear of the}} turret and an {{anti-aircraft}} machine <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> top of it, as well as the addition of two searchlights above the gun for night gunnery, a new VKU-3 command system, and a TPU-3 intercom. Some tanks had a vertically stabilised TOP-1 gun telescopic sight. Ammunition stowage for the main gun was improved from 122 rounds to 147. In 1938, the cylindrical turret was replaced with a conical turret, with the same 45mm model 1934 gun. Some T-26s mod. 1938/1939, equipped with radio set, had a PTK commander's panoramic sight.|$|E

50|$|In 1869, {{after the}} ship became a school ship for the École Navale, this {{armament}} {{was replaced with}} 2 riffled 19 cm <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the lower deck; 16 30-pounder guns, 4 riffled 16-centimetre guns of the 1864 pattern, 8 riffled 16-centimetre guns modified after the 1860 or the 1862 pattern, 2 muzzle-loading 16-centimetre riffled guns, and 2 14-centimetre <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the middle battery; and 2 bronze 12-centimetre <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the deck.|$|R
50|$|The Prince of Wales Tower is 26 {{feet high}} and is 72 feet in diameter. The exposed {{material}} is ironstone rubble masonry, with 8 ft walls. The original construction permitted six mounted <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the roof and four <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the second storey. The tower is a squat, round structure built of stone, almost three times as wide as it is high. The original construction allowed for six mounted <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the roof and four <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the second storey. The second storey was intended for barrack use and the ground floor for storage. The tower is 72 feet in diameter and the walls at the base are 8 feet thick. The tower could accommodate 200 soldiers.Further modifications were made over the next seventy years. By 1813, the Tower mounted four 6-pound <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> garrison carriages on its barrack level, two 24-pound <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> traversing platforms and six 24-pound carronades on traversing slides on top. After 1864, the Tower {{was used as a}} self-defensible depot magazine. The roof was replaced in 2016.|$|R
5|$|Bond later {{scales the}} walls to the Whyte House's top floor to confront Whyte. He is instead met by two {{identical}} Blofelds, who use an electronic device to sound like Whyte. Bond kills one of the Blofelds, {{which turns out to}} be a look-alike. The real Blofeld pulls a <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> Bond, and instructs him into a elevator, where he is knocked out by gas. He is picked up by Wint and Kidd, and taken out to Las Vegas Valley, where he is placed in a pipeline and left to die. The pipeline is buried the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Cane becomes intoxicated. Erica {{enters his}} room, and Jake, {{who has been}} spying, sees the two kiss, but leaves before he sees Cane reject Erica. An embarrassed Erica orders Cane to kill Rose no matter what. When she returns to her saloon, Jake slaps her. Jake goes to Rose's office and tells her {{everything}} he knows. Back at the saloon, Jake draws a <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> Cane, who kills him. Rose does not arrest him as Erica claims it was self-defense.|$|E
5|$|Fonda was {{a visible}} {{political}} activist in the counterculture era during the Vietnam War {{and later became}} involved in advocacy for women. She was famously and controversially photographed sitting on an anti-aircraft <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> a 1972 visit to Hanoi. She has also protested the Iraq War and violence against women, and describes herself as a feminist. In 2005, she, Robin Morgan and Gloria Steinem co-founded the Women's Media Center, an organization that works to amplify the voices {{of women in the}} media through advocacy, media and leadership training, and the creation of original content. Fonda serves {{on the board of the}} organization.|$|E
2500|$|Niger-class frigates were fifth-rates, {{carrying}} a main battery of twenty-six [...] <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the upper deck, four [...] <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the quarterdeck and {{two on the}} forecastle. When fully manned, they carried a complement of 220.|$|R
50|$|The San Esteban Apedreado was a fifth-rate frigate {{built in}} the Guarnizo {{shipyard}} near Santander, Spain, by Lorenzo Arzueta.Her length was 36.28 m, keel 32.59 m, beam 9.31 m and depth in the hold 4.68 m.She displaced 625 tons. She carried eighteen 12-pounder <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the lower <b>gun</b> deck, eighteen 8-pounder <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the upper <b>gun</b> deck, and four 4-pounder <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the quarterdeck.

50|$|The {{original}} {{plan was to}} put three heavy <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the <b>gun</b> platform at the top, with five <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the (second) floor below, sharing the 14 cannon ports. However, during construction the armament was cut back to three 68-pounder and two 10-inch shell <b>guns,</b> all <b>on</b> the <b>gun</b> platform. The guns had a range of 3,000m.|$|R
5|$|Increasingly, {{ski resorts}} are relying on snowmaking, the {{production}} of snow by forcing water and pressurized air through a snow <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> ski slopes. Snowmaking is mainly used to supplement natural snow at ski resorts. This allows them to improve the reliability of their snow cover and to extend their ski seasons from late autumn to early spring. The production of snow requires low temperatures. The threshold temperature for snowmaking increases as humidity decreases. Wet bulb temperature {{is used as a}} metric since it takes air temperature and relative humidity into account. Snowmaking is a relatively expensive process in its energy consumption, thereby limiting its use.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{returned}} home when his state {{took up the}} issue of secession. His successor as governor, Isham G. Harris, and the legislature, organized a referendum on whether to have a constitutional convention to authorize secession; when that failed, they put the question of leaving the Union to a popular vote. Despite threats on Johnson's life, and actual assaults, he campaigned against both questions, sometimes speaking with a <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> the lectern before him. Although Johnson's eastern region of Tennessee was largely against secession, the second referendum passed, and in June 1861, Tennessee joined the Confederacy. Believing he would be killed if he stayed, Johnson fled through the Cumberland Gap, where his party was in fact shot at. He left his wife and family in Greeneville.|$|E
5|$|On Friday, 6 July, President General Musharraf {{left for}} the flood-affected areas of Balochistan. As the president's {{aircraft}} took off from the Islamabad airport, militants fired anti-aircraft weapons {{at it from the}} roof of a house in the Asghar Mall area of Rawalpindi. The militants' relationship with Lal Masjid remains unknown. Security forces recovered two anti-aircraft guns and a machine <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> the rooftop of a Rawalpindi high-rise, one mile (1.6km) from the airport. The government asserted that shots were heard minutes after the president's aircraft took off. Analysts suggest that it may have been retaliation for ongoing operations against Lal Masjid and the government's continued efforts to combat terrorism and Talibanization in northern Waziristan.|$|E
25|$|The Adamastors {{armament}} {{included two}} 150 mm and four 105 mm Krupp naval <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the main deck, {{along with two}} 47 mm Hotchkiss <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the bridge, and Nordenfelt machine guns. The ship also possessed three torpedo tubes.|$|R
5|$|The <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> top of Cochranes {{centreline}} 9.2-inch turrets {{were removed}} in 1915–16. The aftermost 3-pounder <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the superstructure were removed during 1917 {{as well as}} the <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> top of the forward 9.2-inch wing turrets. This reduced her total to twenty 3-pounder guns, excluding the AA guns. Cochranes foremast was converted to a tripod mast to support the weight of a fire-control director in 1917, but the director was not actually fitted until August 1918.|$|R
50|$|It {{was then}} {{intended}} {{for her to}} have carried 58 guns as shown in the table, but this weapon fit was amended on 3 June 1823 to complete her as a 50-gun frigate with an unarmed spar deck, and she was later reduced in 1830 to a 44-gun frigate carrying twenty-six 32-pounder <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the upper deck, twelve more 32-pounder <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the quarterdeck, and two 32-pounder <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the forecastle together with two 8-inch shell guns.|$|R
5|$|Power {{told the}} police that the letter had been written by Williams and that Williams had tried to burgle Sztaray's house and killed Inspector Walls. According to Power, Williams met with his girlfriendFlorence Seymourafter the murder, and the two decided to bury the <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> the beach and {{send a letter to}} Williams' brother asking for money to return to London, which was then given to Power. Power's motive in coming to the police was that {{he was in love with}} Seymour.|$|E
5|$|Sarah advises that Hank and Jacob team up to {{plot against}} Lou. Much to Jacob's dismay, the two {{brothers}} visit Lou at his home where Jacob has him drunkenly confess to the old man's murder. Hank records the false confession with a tape recorder. Lou grows enraged when he realizes that the two have conspired against him and pulls a <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> them. Jacob grabs a rifle from his truck and kills Lou to save his brother. Hank then kills Lou's wife with Lou's shotgun when she appears with another gun. The two brothers avoid arrest after Hank concocts a rehearsed speech for himself and Jacob to tell the police.|$|E
5|$|The Allied commanders {{planned to}} defeat Turkey and force a supply route through to Russia via the Bosporus and the Black Sea. As such they planned a land {{invasion}} on the Gallipoli Peninsula. On {{the afternoon of}} 25 April 1915, Murray's 16th Battalion landed at Ari Burnu, Gallipoli. Setting their machine <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> Pope's Hill, Black and Murray fired their gun throughout the afternoon and into the night. The following day, the battalion's two machine gun crews sniped at the Turkish soldiers on Russell's Top, and Murray and his gunner continued fighting during the counterattack on 26–27 April, despite being wounded.|$|E
