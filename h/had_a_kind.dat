And I felt strongly that he {{had some sort of}} magical background– he'd been dabbling in magic, and something had gone badly wrong." [...] She had also recently reread J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and afterward was inspired to [...] " [...] writing a novel of magic and fantasy".|$|E
500|$|As Glee initial success {{pulled in}} a large audience, John Doyle of The Globe and Mail wrote that the early shows [...] "felt fresh, mainly because the motley crew of kids <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of square naïveté." [...] Doyle notes that the early success took Glee away from its {{original}} characters and plot, focusing more on celebrity guests. [...] "The gaiety is gone from Glee. You should have set it in its prime, mere months ago". Matthew Gilbert of Boston Globe similarly wrote that [...] "It has become a powerful, promotional machine, long on hype and short on the human feeling--the glee--that once made it so addictive".|$|E

500|$|David Greenglass {{was arrested}} by the FBI for espionage in June 1950 and quickly implicated Julius Rosenberg. He {{explicitly}} denied his sister Ethel's involvement when he testified {{before a grand jury}} in August 1950. In February 1951, weeks before the trial, he changed his testimony to claim that Ethel had typed up his notes. He testified against his sister and her husband in court in 1951 as part of an immunity agreement. In exchange for that testimony, the government allowed Ruth to stay with their two children. She was named a co-conspirator, but was never indicted. Greenglass told the court, [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of hero worship there with Julius Rosenberg and I did not want my hero to fail..." ...|$|E
500|$|Carter said of {{the casting}} of Nick Chinlund as Pfaster, [...] "I {{thought it was a}} wonderfully creepy villain. The casting of that show was very difficult. We saw many actors, but there was a quality I was looking for and I couldn't put a name on that quality. I finally figured out what it was when Nick came in and he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of {{androgynous}} quality that worked. I thought he looked like Joe College, but he could scare the hell out of you." [...] Producer Glen Morgan said Chinlund's performance was outstanding. Nutter stated [...] "Nick Chinlund was wonderful to work with. The guy was like putty in my hands. He was great. If you're looking for someone to underline the weirdness and strangeness of the character, he did that." ...|$|E
500|$|Johnny Depp as Ed Wood: Burton {{approached}} Depp and [...] "within 10 {{minutes of}} hearing about the project, I was committed," [...] the actor remembers. At the time, Depp was depressed about films and filmmaking. By accepting this part, {{it gave him a}} [...] "chance to stretch out and have some fun", and working with Martin Landau, [...] "rejuvenated my love for acting". Depp was already familiar with some of Wood's films through John Waters, who had shown him Plan 9 from Outer Space and Glen or Glenda. To get a handle on how to portray Wood, Depp studied the performance of Jack Haley as the Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz, and the acting of Mickey Rooney, Ronald Reagan and Casey Kasem. He watched several Reagan speeches because the actor felt that [...] "he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of blind optimism that was perfect for Ed Wood." [...] Depp also borrowed some of Kasem's cadence and [...] "that utterly confident, breezy salesman quality in his voice".|$|E

500|$|At the 2009 Tokyo Motor Show, Honda {{presented}} the EV-Cub concept vehicle, an electric motorcycle patterned after the venerable Super Cub, featuring two-wheel drive {{by means of}} electric motors mounted in the hubs {{of each of the}} wheels. Honda said they felt keeping the 1958 layout for their 21st century concept bike made sense because, [...] "the human body has not changed in the past 50 years," [...] and, [...] "the size, shape and position of all the Super Cub parts <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of necessity to them, and that the design of the Super Cub was very rational and rider-centric." [...] The additional space created by the absence of the engine {{in the center of the}} frame and the lack of a gas tank created room for underseat helmet storage, typical of a scooter. Integrated with the new electric motorcycle was an interactive communications system, to let riders converse while riding. Several other companies, including Christini, KTM, Öhlins, and Yamaha have done development on two-wheel drive motorcycles, and have found that the addition of power to the front as well as the rear wheel aids in stability, particularly in corners and in the hands of novice riders. At the time Honda hinted that they would bring the EV-Cub to market in 2010. In a 2016 speech, Honda's President and CEO Takahiro Hachigo said they planned to release the EV Cub in Japan in about two years, followed later in other ASEAN markets.|$|E
500|$|While Allied leaders {{expressed}} {{mixed feelings}} on Patton's capabilities, the German High Command was noted {{to have more}} respect for him than for any other Allied commander after 1943. Adolf Hitler reportedly called him [...] "that crazy cowboy general". Many German field commanders were generous in their praise of Patton's leadership following the war, {{and many of its}} highest commanders also held his abilities in high regard. Erwin Rommel credited Patton with executing [...] "the most astonishing achievement in mobile warfare". Generaloberst Alfred Jodl, {{chief of staff of the}} German Army, stated that Patton [...] "was the American Guderian. He was very bold and preferred large movements. He took big risks and won big successes." [...] Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring noted that [...] "Patton had developed tank warfare into an art, and understood how to handle tanks brilliantly in the field. I feel compelled, therefore, to compare him with Generalfeldmarschall Rommel, who likewise had mastered the art of tank warfare. Both of them <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of second sight in regard to this type of warfare." [...] Referring to the escape of the Afrika Korps after the Battle of El Alamein, Fritz Bayerlein opined that [...] "I do not think that General Patton would let us get away so easily." [...] In an interview conducted for Stars and Stripes just after his capture, Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt stated simply of Patton, [...] "He is your best." ...|$|E

Allen was reluctant to write about Capote at first, but once she had researched him, she found the last ten years of his life not as off-putting as she had thought: [...] "Capote <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of Gallantry {{in the face of a}} devastating situation." [...] Friends of Capote were amazed at her accuracy portraying a man she had only met but not known, and there was much question about how many of the lines are Capote's and how many Allen's; she maintained that at least 70% of the dialogue is Capote's own.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Eggleston {{was sent}} to the Webb School, a {{boarding}} establishment.

I never knew what that was supposed to mean. It was so callous and dumb. It was {{the kind of place where}} it was considered effeminate to like music and painting." [...] Eggleston was unusual among his peers in eschewing the traditional Southern male pursuits of hunting and sports, in favor of artistic pursuits and observation of the world. Nevertheless, Eggleston noted that he never felt like an outsider. [...] "I never had the feeling that I didn't fit in," [...] he told a reporter, [...] "But probably I didn't." ...|$|E

We wanted to go into the studio, record and mix the album and then distribute it directly. Unlike the two previous albums, which were produced with Danish producer Joshua, En plats i solen is produced with Swedish producer Stefan Boman who worked with the band on Du & jag döden (2005). The band also released the first single from the forthcoming album, featuring the two A-sides Gamla Ullevi and Skisser för sommaren.|$|E

2500|$|The Boston Herald {{stated that}} part of the {{reaction}} in the response could be blamed on two packages that did not blink. According to Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis, phony pipe bombs were also discovered that day, one inside Tufts-New England Medical Center at 1p.m. A security guard described [...] "an agitated white male" [...] fleeing saying, [...] "God is warning you that today {{is going to be a}} sad day." [...] The Herald went on to characterize the placement of the devices as a [...] "coordinated hoax." [...] Davis also mentioned other incidents of the day that may have influenced the reaction, including a Washington, D.C. metro stop being shut down due to a suspected package, and fumes emanating from a package at a post office in New York City, resulting in four people being treated there. [...] "It was almost like we <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of perfect storm of circumstances falling into place," [...] Davis said.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, H. R. Giger was {{approached}} on July 28, 1990, by David Fincher and Tim Zinnemann, and {{was asked to}} redesign his own creations for Alien 3. Giger's new designs included an aquatic face-hugger and a four-legged version of the adult Alien. Giger {{said in an interview}} [...] "I had special ideas to make it more interesting. I designed a new creature, which was much more elegant and beastly, compared to my original. It was a four-legged Alien, more like a lethal feline – a panther or something. It <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of skin that was built up from other creatures – much like a symbiosis." [...] However, when Tom Woodruff and Alec Gillis of Amalgamated Dynamics told Giger that they had their own design, Giger expressed himself as [...] "very upset" [...] and that the creature he had especially designed was his [...] "baby". Even after the production severed contact, Giger continued to fax suggestions to Fincher, and made full-scale drawings and a sculpt of the Alien, all of which were rejected.|$|E
