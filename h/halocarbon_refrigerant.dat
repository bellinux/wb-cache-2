The method used in this study was an experimental method to perform the replacement of halocarbons into a hydrocarbon refrigerant with mass amounts of hydrocarbon refrigerants of 60 grams. The results of the study of refrigerant hydrocarbon with mass amounts of 60 grams was found that the required electrical power for compressor of 0. 14 kW, power of cooling of 0. 73 kW, the heating power of 0. 94 kW, and Coefficient Of Performance of 5. 21...|$|E

40|$|This paper first {{presents}} a brief historical {{summary of the}} recent past and current status of refrigerants, and then proceeds to suggest a simple Second Law-based approach using the ideal vapor compression refrigeration cycle to estimate a refrigerant’s performance potential. The resulting performance rankings are then supplemented by additional rankings of the exergy losses in the compressor and in the condenser. These methodologies are then applied to several refrigerants: three natural refrigerants (ammonia, propane, and isobutane), five conventional single-component <b>halocarbon</b> <b>refrigerants,</b> two conventional blends of <b>halocarbon</b> <b>refrigerants,</b> and three newer refrigerants (fluorinated propene isomers). Generally speaking, the lower pressure refrigerants have better COP and lesser volumetric cooling capacity than the higher pressure refrigerants; whereas, the lower pressure refrigerants have higher penalty factor (measure of condenser exergy losses) than the higher pressure refrigerants. The analyses {{presented in this paper}} suggest that to minimize a refrigeration system’s overall impact on the environment, the choice of refrigerant should not necessarily be based on a single criterion but rather should be chosen based on the particular application...|$|R

40|$|In the future, {{it would}} be {{preferable}} to replace the <b>halocarbon</b> <b>refrigerants</b> with natural refrigerants like carbon dioxide, {{but there have been}} concerns over the use of carbon dioxide as a refrigerant due to its perceived inefficiency. It is possible to partially overcome this problem by the manipulation of the cylinders of the compressors used in the vapor compression refrigeration cycle. If some of the cylinders are used to compress vapor in a parallel compression system from an intermediary pressure, a refrigerating effect and COP greater than that of the system with all of the cylinders on suction can be achieved. An analytic model was created that allowed environmental and physical parameters to be altered. The investigations also included experimentation with the addition of superheat for the primary compression path, for which performance increases were noted for some operating conditions. The primary focus of the research was for the use of carbon dioxide in a standard air conditioning application. Accordingly, evaporation and condensation pressures were selected to correspond closely with evaporation and condensation temperatures for other refrigerants. Under the conditions used for the following research, superheating did not improve efficiency, and was not included. Physical limitations placed on the ratio of the suction cylinder swept volume to the economized cylinder swept volume suggest that building this economized compressor would be feasible. In fact, a standard reciprocating compressor could be altered such that 2 to 4 cylinders, depending on the volumetric ratio, are used for the economized path. The research demonstrates that under some conditions an economized carbon dioxide system outperforms a similar halocarbon system in terms of efficiency and capacity. In the end, this is the litmus test that proves that carbon dioxide can compete on the level with popular <b>halocarbon</b> <b>refrigerants</b> in this economized mode. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This paper reports {{results from}} an {{investigation}} {{on the performance}} of the Rohsenow’s type of correlation when applied to the nucleate boiling of <b>halocarbon</b> <b>refrigerants</b> over cylindrical surfaces of different material. Experimental data for refrigerants R- 11, R- 123, R- 12, and R- 134 a have been raised and fitted according to two different procedures. It has been determined that exponents m and n are weakly affected by the refrigerant, and surface material and finishing. Liquid/surface combinations and surface roughness affect the coefficient Csf. A correlation has been developed for Csf in terms of the liquid/surface combination and surface roughness. The resulting correlation has been evaluated through the experimental data used in the fitting process and results obtained elsewhere. Deviations of correlation with respect to the experimental heat transfer coefficient are within acceptable ranges...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- A broad micro-scale flow boiling {{database}} and three most recent proposed micro-scale heat transfer prediction methods are carefully compared in this paper. The database comprises experimental results from independent laboratories for 11 fluids (<b>halocarbon</b> <b>refrigerants,</b> water and CO 2), mass velocities from 100 to 800 kg/m 2 s, reduced pressures from 0. 03 to 0. 77 and heat fluxes from 5 to 180 kW/m 2. The {{analysis of these}} experimental results reveals large discrepancies between different datasets, even at similar experimental conditions, which enforces the need of further work to develop a reliable experimental database. Although some heat transfer trends were captured by the prediction methods, in general they poorly predicted the database. The study presented here concludes that the method proposed by Thome and coworkers, {{which is based on}} the heat transfer mechanisms occurring in micro-scale channels, seems to be the most promising approach...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} new method for {{evaluating}} the adsorbed phase volume during physisorption of several gases on activated carbon specimens. We treat the adsorbed phase as another equilibrium phase which satisfies the Gibbs equation and hence assume that the law of rectilinear diameters is applicable. Since invariably the bulk gas phase densities are known along measured isotherms, the constants of the adsorbed phase volume can be regressed from the experimental data. We take the Dubinin-Astakhov isotherm {{as the model for}} verifying our hypothesis since {{it is one of the}} few equations that accounts for adsorbed phase volume changes. In addition, the pseudo-saturation pressure in the supercritical region is calculated by letting the index of the temperature term in Dubinin's equation to be temperature dependent. Based on over 50 combinations of activated carbons and adsorbates (nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons and <b>halocarbon</b> <b>refrigerants)</b> it is observed that the proposed changes fit experimental data quite well...|$|R

40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professor Gregory F. Nellis; 247 pp. The purpose {{of this research was}} to investigate the economic feasibility of a water-based vapor compression chiller with a nominal capacity of 1000 tons. Low-level models of various potential cycle configurations have been constructed and the results of simulations for each cycle configuration are described. More detailed component level models were developed to accurately size equipment and predict system performance for the most attractive cycle configuration. These component models address issues that are particularly crucial in water as refrigerant cycles, such as compressor discharge superheat and refrigerant side pressure drop. Where possible, these component models were verified through comparison against the current state-of-the-art technology for large chillers using R- 134 a as a refrigerant. The capital cost and the expected operating costs are determined to quantify the payback time associated with using water as a refrigerant relative to traditional <b>halocarbon</b> <b>refrigerants</b> currently in use. Other issues that may have an economic impact on the feasibility of water as a viable alternative to R- 134 a such as the possibility of using direct contact heat exchangers, purging issues, and condensation at the compressor inlet have been discussed...|$|R
40|$|Ejectors {{are used}} {{for a wide range}} of applications. Refrigeration systems have, a long {{established}} history. Ejector refrigerators working on steam or <b>halocarbon</b> <b>refrigerants</b> provide a high level of flexibility. Ejector can also be used in solar-powered refrigeration systems and absorption-refrigeration systems. There are very few comprehensive theoretical studies even though several models for ejectors in literature. A new ejector theory was developed by Munday and Bagster (1977). This theory depends on the assumption of two discrete streams, the motive stream and the secondary stream. The two streams maintain their identity down the converging duct of the diffuser. At some section the secondary flow reaches sonic velocity. The shocking and mixing occur at the very end of the converging cone resulting in a transient supersonic mixed stream. There is no supersonic deceleration and a shock takes place immediately on mixing. The mixed stream will shock to the subsonic, found by the intersection of the Fanno and Rayleigh lines. After that the stream is brought to near zero velocity in the diffuser. In the present work this theory is used as a basis, in order to develop a computerized model of ejector with particular reference to steam-ejector at various operating conditions. The results are compared with available from the literature experimental data. Also a parametric study is conducted in order to reveal the influence of the various parameters on the performance of the steam jet refrigeration...|$|R
40|$|Type of {{refrigerant}} {{the most}} recognized {{and the most}} used today in the vapor compression cycle is R- 12 <b>refrigerant</b> (<b>halocarbon</b> group), which is technically quite good. The refrigerant also has low toxicity and low flammable. But, in the mid 1970 ’s known that chlorine has contained in the refrigerant were released into the environment could damage of ozone in the stratosphere and caused greenhouse effect. Because of that, it using has stopped. An alternative refrigerant is hydrocarbon refrigerant (HCR) and one of it is hydrocarbon- 12 (HCR- 12). HCR- 12 have several advantages, besides friendly environmental because have low global warming effect and low destruction of ozone, this type of refrigerator {{can be used as}} direct changer on the refrigerant machine so no needed compressor replacement and more efficient electric energy than R- 12. In this research, did a study experimental to compared R- 12 with HCR- 12 with used vapor compression cooler machine. The result of measurement have been get performance of vapor compression cooler machine COPR (Coefficient of Performance Refrigeration) and COP (Coefficient of Performance Heat Pump) for R- 12 and HCR- 12 relatively are 2. 4 – 9. 8 (COPRHP) and 3. 4 – 10. 8 (COP) and 6. 4 – 14. 1 (COP R) and 7. 4 – 15. 1 (COPHP).

40|$|Two {{catalysts}} for {{the selective}} oxidation of trace amounts of contaminant gases in air {{have been developed}} for use aboard the International Space Station. These catalysts might also be useful for reducing concentrations of fumes in terrestrial industrial facilities especially facilities that use <b>halocarbons</b> as solvents, <b>refrigerant</b> liquids, and foaming agents, as well as facilities that generate or utilize ammonia. The first catalyst is of the supported-precious-metal type. This catalyst is highly active for the oxidation of halocarbons, hydrocarbons, and oxygenates at low concentrations in air. This catalyst is more active for the oxidation of hydrocarbons and halocarbons than are competing catalysts developed in recent years. This catalyst completely converts these airborne contaminant gases to carbon dioxide, water, and mineral acids that can be easily removed from the air, and does not make any chlorine gas in the process. The catalyst is thermally stable and is not poisoned by chlorine or fluorine atoms produced on its surface during the destruction of a halocarbon. In addition, the catalyst can selectively oxidize ammonia to nitrogen at a temperature between 200 and 260 C, without making nitrogen oxides, which are toxic. The temperature of 260 C is higher than the operational temperature of any other precious-metal catalyst that can selectively oxidize ammonia. The purpose of the platinum in this catalyst is to oxidize hydrocarbons and to ensure that the oxidation of halocarbons goes to completion. However, the platinum exhibits little or no activity for initiating the destruction of halocarbons. Instead, the attack on the halocarbons is initiated by the support. The support also provides a high surface area for exposure of the platinum. Moreover, the support resists deactivation or destruction by halogens released during the destruction of halocarbons. The second catalyst is of the supported- metal-oxide type. This catalyst can selectively oxidize ammonia to nitrogen at temperatures up to 400 C, without producing nitrogen oxides. This catalyst converts ammonia completely to nitrogen, even when the concentration of ammonia is very low. No other catalyst is known to oxidize ammonia selectively at such a high temperature and low concentration. Both the metal oxide and the support contribute to the activity and selectivity of this catalyst...|$|R
