40|$|Lutheran Hebrew {{scholarship}} {{in the era}} of Orthodoxy has suffered the same kind of scholarly neglect as theology from this period. A few Hebraists such as Wilhelm Schickard or Wolfgang Ratke have been the subjects of monographs or collections of articles, while others receive mention in university histories or books related to Jewish-Christian relations in early modern Germany. Only within the past decade have scholars addressed this facet of Reformation-era Christian Hebraism. Johann Anselm Steiger examined the use that Johann Gerhard and Solomon Glassius made of post-biblical Jewish literature, while Kenneth G. Appold has stressed the pivotal role that Hebrew and other Semitic languages would play in the development of theological discourse in Wittenberg beginning in the early 1630 s. In my study of Lutheran Hebraism I will present a broader view of the phenomenon, based above all upon the Hebrew book trade within Lutheran Germany. Peter N. Miller identified centers of Hebrew scholarship as possessing a »critical mass of erudition« that consisted of four factors: scholars who were well-versed in oriental languages, library resources, specialized printing facilities, and well-disposed patrons to support such scholarship. s Lutheran Germany possessed all of these resources to some degree, and Lutheran Hebraists were active in publishing their work even during the darkest days of the Thirty Years War. To assess the extent of Lutheran Hebrew erudition I will consider first Lutheran universities and their role in Hebrew education, then the Hebrew book trade as measured both by the Leipzig book <b>fair</b> <b>catalogues</b> from 1601 - 1660 and by the Hebraica libraries of Lutheran scholars and institutions, and finally the Lutheran interest in Hebrew scholarship as attested by the Christian Hebrew books published by Lutheran authors in Glassius 2 ̆ 7 time...|$|R

In 1912, the company {{employed}} their equipment and demonstrated {{the utilization of}} alternating current electricity to enhance the growth of plants in a nursery near London. In 1929, an advertisement in the British Industries <b>Fair</b> <b>Catalogue</b> announced an Optical, Scientific and Photographic Exhibit. The exhibition featured manufacturers of microscopes for medical, industrial, and educational purposes and for the amateur, prism binoculars, astronomical and portable telescopes, photographic lenses and cameras, surveying and measuring instruments, photometers, and scientific apparatus of every description. The W. Watson & Son company exhibited in the Scientific Section at Stand No. N.24. In 1947, the firm was a Listed Exhibitor at the British Industries Fair. The Fair featured manufacturers of microscopes for all purposes and auxiliary optical and mechanical accessories. The company offered photometers, telescopes, prism binoculars, photographic lenses of all types, and optical elements in every form. W.

5000|$|From 1968 to 1975 Broodthaers {{produced}} large-scale environmental {{pieces that}} reworked {{the very notion}} of the museum. His most noted work was an installation which began in his Brussels house which he called Musée d'Art Moderne, Départment des Aigles (1968), containing different representations of eagles in glass cases that were accompanied by signs that asserted [...] "This is not a work of art", implying that museums obscure the ideological functioning of images by imposing illegitimate classifications of value. This installation was followed by a further eleven manifestations of the 'museum', including at the Kunsthalle Düsseldorf for an exhibition in 1970 and at documenta 5 in Kassel in 1972. In 1970 Broodthaers conceived of the Financial Section, which encompassed an attempt to sell the museum [...] "on account of bankruptcy." [...] The sale was announced {{on the cover of the}} Art Cologne <b>fair</b> <b>catalogue</b> in 1971, but no buyers were found. As part of the Financial Section, the artist also produced an unlimited edition of gold ingots stamped with the museum's emblem, an eagle, a symbol associated with power and victory. The ingots were sold to raise money for the museum, at a price calculated by doubling the market value of gold, the surcharge representing the bar's value as art. In 1975 Broodthaers presented the exhibition [...] "L’Angelus de Daumier" [...] at the Centre National d’Art Contemporain in Paris, at which each room had the name of a colour. In La Salle Blanche (The White Room) (1975), a life-size copy of a room and a half in Broodthaers' home in Brussels, the wooden walls of the empty, unfurnished rooms are covered with printed words in French—such as museum, gallery, oil, subject, composition, images, and privilege—all intended to examine [...] "the influence of language on perceptions of the world and the ways museums affect the production and consumption of art." [...] For such works he is associated with the late 20th century global spread of both installation art as well as [...] "institutional critique," [...] in which interrelationships between artworks, the artist, and the museum are a focus. Indeed, Broodthaers' Musée d'Art Moderne, his [...] "first fictional museum," [...] allowed him to simultaneously posture as artist, director, curator and trustee in a self-reflexive examination of the order and prescriptions implicit in the production of museum exhibits.|$|E

60|$|Honesty, moral conduct, industry, {{constancy}} of purpose, temperance in power, courage, {{and love}} of country: these virtues all belonged to Robespierre; history confesses it, and to what favoured hero does history assign a <b>fairer</b> <b>catalogue?</b> Whose name does a brighter galaxy adorn? With such qualities, such attributes, why was he not the Washington of France? Why, instead of the Messiah of freedom, which he believed himself to be, has his name become a bye-word, a reproach, and an enormity? Because he wanted faith! He believed in nothing but himself, and the reasoning faculty with which he felt himself to be endowed. He thought himself perfect in his own human nature, and wishing to make others perfect as he was, he fell into the lowest abyss of crime and misery in which a poor human creature ever wallowed. He seems almost to have been sent into the world to prove the inefficacy of human reason to effect human happiness. He was gifted with a power over common temptation, which belongs to but few. His blood was cool and temperate, and yet his heart was open to all the softer emotions. He had no appetite for luxury; no desire for pomp; no craving for wealth. Among thousands who were revelling in sensuality, he kept himself pure and immaculate. If any man could have said, I will be virtuous; I, of myself, unaided, trusting to my own power, guarding myself {{by the light of}} my own reason; I will walk uprightly through the world, and will shed light from my path upon my brethren, he might have said so. He attempted it, and history shows us the result. He attempted, unassisted, to be perfect among men, and his memory is regarded as that of a loathsome plague, defiling even the unclean age in which he lived.|$|R

40|$|This {{working paper}} {{examines}} {{the role of}} international book fairs in the global publishing industry, and in particular their relation to the publishing cycle, chain and field. It outlines some relevant historical features, as well as main functions, of fairs, before describing in detail the daily activities of an independent academic publisher at the Frankfurt Book Fair. Analysis of the book fair takes place at two levels. The first focuses {{on the importance of}} visibility in a fair’s timing and location, {{as well as in the}} location and size of participants’ stands, inclusion in the <b>fair</b> <b>catalogue,</b> business deals, and social gatherings. The second examines the book fair as a tournament of values, or ritual tournament, in terms of its framing, membership and currency. The argument presented is that the currency of copyright is not dissimilar to a form of gift exchange and that, as a result, a book is both commodity and gift. It is in the shadow of the gift that the commodity of the book is produced, distributed, sold and read...|$|E

A remedy for {{the negative effects of}} the traditional "one-size-fits-all" approach is to enhance the system's ability to adapt its own behaviour to the users characteristics, such as goals, tasks, interests, that are stored in user profiles. Filtering techniques are used to analyse profile data and provide recommendation to the users to help them navigating in the site and retrieving information of interest. However, techniques such as collaborative filtering are very time consuming and for this are not suitable to be implemented in small systems. We describe here the approach we have adopted in FAIRWIS trade FAIR Web-based Information Services), a system that offers on-line innovative services to support the trade fair business processes and a great number of exhibitors organized in a Web-based virtual fair.

40|$|South and Southeast Asia is {{the center}} of origin for many {{tropical}} fruit crops. This region is a prime habitat for in situ conservation of genetic diversity of long-lived, largely out-crossing wild/domesticated Tropical Fruit Tree (TFT) species. Wild TFT species in 36 project sites throughout India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand were examined with an objective of documenting species richness and understanding their local uses and potential value in plant breeding/ecosystem services. Multiple methods such as participatory rural appraisal, baseline survey, focus group discussion on traditional knowledge documentation, fruit diversity <b>fairs,</b> community fruit <b>catalogues</b> and key informant surveys of custodian farmers were carried out focusing on wild species of Mangifera, Garcinia, Nephelium and Citrus. For the genus Mangifera, highest number of wild species (LSQUOsRSQUO) was recorded among the communities of Indonesia (11) and Malaysia (11), while it was 6 in Thailand and only one in India. Communities of Thailand also showed highest LSQUOsRSQUO value for Garcinia (14), while it was 8 for Malaysian, 5 in Indian and 3 for Indonesian communities. For the genus Nephelium, 7 species were used in Malaysia, 5 in Indonesia and 5 in Thailand. However, communities of India showed higher species richness of Citrus (8) and it was 2 for communities of Thailand. This study concludes that South and South East Asian countries are stunningly rich in wild fruit tree species diversity. However their principal economic value as genetic resources and the benefits derived from their associated cultural value is seldom demonstrated by public-sector research initiatives. It is also concluded that there are potentials for marketing of wild species of Mangifera viz. M. pajang, M. caesia, M. odorata, M. casturi; of Citrus viz. C. indica, C. macroptera, C. assamensis, C. ichangensis, C. megaloxycarpa (Sour Pummelo); of Garcinia viz. G. cowa, G. atroviridis, G. indica, G. xanthochymus, G. gummi-gutta and of Nephalium viz.
