5|$|After {{graduating from}} DePauw, Julian wanted to obtain his {{doctorate}} in chemistry, but learned <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> an African-American to do so. Instead he obtained {{a position as}} a chemistry instructor at Fisk University. In 1923 he received an Austin Fellowship in Chemistry, which allowed him to attend Harvard University to obtain his M.S. However, worried that Euro-American students would resent being taught by an African-American, Harvard withdrew Julian's teaching assistantship, {{making it impossible for}} him to complete his Ph.D. at Harvard.|$|E
5|$|Murphy {{took the}} party into the 2015 United Kingdom general election, which saw a {{majority}} {{win for the}} Conservatives, and Labour's worst-ever election result in Scotland. There was a landslide shift towards the SNP, which took 56 of the 59 Scottish seats at Westminster, while Labour lost 40 of the 41 Westminster seats it was defending. Notable losses included Murphy's constituency of East Renfrewshire and Brown's former constituency of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, previously Labour's safest seat in Scotland. Other high-profile figures such as Sarwar, Clark, Curran, Ian Davidson, and Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander also lost their seats. Following his defeat, Murphy spoke of his intention to stand for a Holyrood seat in 2016. However, the result prompted Labour figures {{and those in the}} trade union movement to question the future of his leadership. Ian Davidson suggested that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> Murphy to remain as Scottish Labour leader without a parliamentary seat and in the wake of such a heavy defeat. Rafferty, and Kevin Lindsay of ASLEF, called for his resignation, while Findlay, and Labour's local government spokesman Alex Rowley, expressed their concerns about the party's future under Murphy's leadership and resigned from his shadow cabinet.|$|E
5|$|The {{ruler of}} Jodhpur, Hanwant Singh, was antipathetic to the Congress, {{and did not}} see much future in India for him or the {{lifestyle}} he wished to lead. Along with the ruler of Jaisalmer, he entered into negotiations with Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who was the designated head of state for Pakistan. Jinnah was keen to attract {{some of the larger}} border states, hoping thereby to attract other Rajput states to Pakistan and compensate for the loss of half of Bengal and Punjab. He offered to permit Jodhpur and Jaisalmer to accede to Pakistan on any terms they chose, giving their rulers blank sheets of paper and asking them to write down their terms, which he would sign. Jaisalmer refused, arguing that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> him to side with Muslims against Hindus in the event of communal problems. Hanwant Singh came close to signing. However, the atmosphere in Jodhpur was in general hostile to accession to Pakistan. Mountbatten also pointed out that the accession of a predominantly Hindu state to Pakistan would violate the principle of the two-nation theory on which Partition was based, and was likely to cause communal violence in the State. Hanwant Singh was persuaded by these arguments, and somewhat reluctantly agreed to accede to India.|$|E

5|$|Because Allied {{air superiority}} meant <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the Germans {{to move up}} their reserves, Rommel {{believed}} that their best chance was to stop the invasion at the shore. The scope of the invasion meant that once these coastal defences were defeated and the troops scattered, {{it was difficult to}} defend territory inland or launch counter-attacks. At 22:33, Kraiss ordered the 352nd Division to create a defensive line north of Bayeux but this proved impossible, as most of the territory involved was already in British hands and all the defending units had taken serious losses. The Luftwaffe played only a minor role on D-Day. At Gold, several small groups of bombers that arrived at sunset caused Allied casualties at Le Hamel and damaged a road near Ver-sur-Mer. At 06:00 on 7 June, the operations room of , offshore near Gold, was damaged by a bomber attack, but the ship was able to remain on station. The unit responsible was likely II./Kampfgeschwader 40 (KG 40—Bomber Wing 40). Under the command of Fliegerführer Atlantik (Flyer Command Atlantic), it was based at Bordeaux–Merignac. On the evening of the 6/7 June 1944, 26 Heinkel He 177 heavy bombers equipped with Henschel Hs 293 anti-ship guided missiles attacked shipping over Normandy, included the Gold area. II./KG 40 lost 13 aircraft to all causes during the attack.|$|E
25|$|One major {{complaint}} {{was about the}} concourses, which were considered somewhat narrow by modern standards, making for cramped conditions whenever attendance was anywhere near capacity.

25|$|The Indian {{newspapers}} depend a {{great deal}} on governmental advertising; without such revenues, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> many Indian newspapers to stay in business. Unfortunately, this has kept many of them vulnerable to government manipulation. The large-scale possibility of such manipulation, however, was not fully demonstrated until Indira Gandhi's government decided {{to take advantage of this}} unique circumstance. In the beginning of censorship, when a few leading newspapers such as The Indian Express and The Statesman refused to abide the governmental censorship, the government withdrew its advertising support from these newspapers. Later on, this type of financial castigation was used on several other rebellious newspapers.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, then-Apostle Ezra Taft Benson {{was quoted}} by the Associated Press that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> a {{faithful}} Latter-day Saint to be a liberal Democrat. Although the LDS Church has officially repudiated such statements on many occasions, Democratic candidates—including LDS Democrats—believe that Republicans {{capitalize on the}} perception that the Republican Party is doctrinally superior. Political scientist and pollster Dan Jones explains this disparity by noting that the national Democratic Party is associated with liberal positions on gay marriage and abortion, both of which the LDS Church is against. The Republican Party in heavily Mormon Utah County presents itself as the superior choice for Latter-day Saints. Even though Utah Democratic candidates are predominantly LDS, socially conservative, and pro-life, no Democrat has won in Utah County since 1994.|$|E
25|$|Su Shi {{and friends}} {{continued}} to write poetry, despite (or perhaps encouraged by) their frequent banishment. Su Shi collected {{some of his}} extent works from friends, having ensured that any offending lines had been removed (Murck, 50). Some of his poetry began {{more and more to}} use such a deep and subtle allusive process that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> those outside his group to grasp the real meaning, let alone put him back on trial. One of these techniques was to use rhymes from other poems; thus, alluding to lines from that poem, and also alluding to other poems which Su Shi and his friends circulated which also matched these rhymes. Subtle complexities of profound political dissent could then be masked under cover of seemingly innocuous lines about nature scenes in the Xiaoxiang region: indeed a set of 8 conventional scenes evolved (Murck, passim). These are known as the Eight Views of Xiaoxiang.|$|E

25|$|In 1959, President Eisenhower {{nominated}} a recovered Luce {{to be the}} US Ambassador to Brazil. She {{began to}} learn enough of the Portuguese language {{in preparation for the}} job, but she was by now so conservative that her appointment met with strong opposition from a small number of Democratic senators. Leading the charge was Oregon Senator Wayne Morse. Still, Luce was confirmed by a 79 to 11 vote. Her husband urged her to decline the appointment, noting that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> her to work with Morse, who chaired the Senate Subcommittee on Latin American Affairs. Luce eventually sent Eisenhower a letter explaining that she felt that the controversy surrounding her appointment would hinder her abilities to be respected by both her Brazilian and US coworkers and resigned from her position as ambassador. She had served only four days, from April 28 to May 1, 1959, and she had never left American soil.|$|E
25|$|Li Yuan {{began to}} gather {{forces from the}} region, {{claiming}} that they were necessary to defend against the Turks, which drew suspicions from his deputies Wang Wei (王威) and Gao Junya (高君雅). Li Yuan, afraid that Wang and Gao would act against him first, then used a Turkish attack {{as an excuse to}} falsely claim that Wang and Gao were working in concert with the Turkish khagan, Shibi Khan (Ashina Duojishi), and had them executed. He sent secret messengers to Hedong to recall his sons Li Jiancheng, Li Yuanji (both by Duchess Dou) and Li Zhiyun (李智雲, by his concubine Lady Wan), whom he had left there to watch over his household, and the capital Chang'an to recall his daughter (the future Princess Pingyang) and her husband Chai Shao (柴紹). Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji, leaving Li Zhiyun at Hedong, soon met with Chai, and they arrived together at Taiyuan. Li Yuan's daughter, believing <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> her to flee with Chai, chose to hide instead.|$|E
25|$|Al-Azhar University's Council of Senior Scholars {{was founded}} in 1911 but was {{replaced}} in 1961 by the Center for Islamic Research. In July 2012, after the law restricting Al-Azhar University's autonomy was modified by the incoming president Mohamed Morsi, the Council was reformed. The Council consists of 40 members and as of February 2013 had 14 vacancies all appointed by the current imam of Al-Azhar, Ahmed El-Tayeb, who was appointed by the prior president, Hosni Mubarak. Once the remaining 14 vacancies are filled, new vacancies will be appointed by the existing Council itself. All four madhahib (schools) of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence are proportionally represented on the Council (Hanafi, Shafi'i, Hanbali, Maliki) and voting is on a majority basis. In addition to El-Tayeb, other prominent members of the Council include the outgoing Grand Mufti Ali Gomaa. The Council is tasked with nominating the Grand Mufti of Egypt (subject to presidential approval), electing the next Grand Imam of Al-Azhar Mosque, {{and is expected to}} be the final authority in determining if new legislation is compliant with Islamic law. Although the Council's decisions are not binding (absent new legislation), it is expected that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the parliament to pass legislation deemed by the Council as against Islamic law.|$|E

25|$|On 16 June at 10:00 am, MacDonald's vanguard arrived near Piacenza {{and began}} {{pressing}} Ott's command. Suvorov reiterated his orders for Ott {{to make a}} fighting retreat to the Stradella defile. By this time Austrian military engineer Albert Johann de Best got the Piacenza citadel into a defensible state after eight days of work; two or three companies of the Fröhlich Regiment were assigned to garrison it. Victor's division led the French attack on Ott as Rusca's soldiers edged toward the south as if to flank the Austrians out of position. That night, Suvorov's chief of staff Johann Gabriel Chasteler de Courcelles rushed toward Ott's position with 100 dragoons of the Karaczay Regiment plus a half-battery of horse artillery. Following behind was an improvised force including the Wouwermanns Grenadier Battalion, three battalions of the Fröhlich Regiment, {{the remainder of the}} Karaczay Regiment and one and one-half batteries of horse artillery. If Ott could hold out along the Tidone River, it would allow ample space for the Austro-Russian army to deploy between the Po and the mountain spurs to the south. If Ott were forced back into the narrow Stradella position, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the Allies to form a line of battle and might even cause a rout.|$|E
25|$|On 31 July Tartar sighted a {{schooner}}. Maxwell set off {{to prevent}} the schooner from entering the narrow and intricate channel between the island of Saona and San Domingo where <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> him to pursue. As Tartar got closer {{he saw that the}} schooner was using her sweeps to aid her. Her behaviour made Maxwell suspect that his quarry was a privateer so he pursued her until neither vessel could progress farther. At that point, Maxwell was unable to get Tartar into a position from which she could use her broadside. Instead, he sent in a cutting out party in three boats. As the boats set out, their quarry fired a gun, hoisted French colours, and then opened fire on the boats. The schooner was not able to deter the attack and the British captured her with no more casualties than two men wounded. The French lost nine killed and six wounded, as well as three missing, presumed drowned when they tried to swim to shore. Maxwell sent the wounded to San Domingo under flag of truce, but kept the other Frenchmen prisoners, there being no English prisoners available for exchange. The privateer was Hirondelle, under the command of Captain La Place. She was armed with ten 4-pounder guns and had been out of San Domingo for two days. She had been active during the French Revolutionary Wars and {{for the past two years}} also, having frequently escaped pursuit due to her speed.|$|E
