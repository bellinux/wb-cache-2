500|$|On {{a list of}} Lost episodes, the Los Angeles Times ranked [...] "A Tale of Two Cities" [...] number 66 out of 113 episodes, {{explaining}} it was [...] "Not bad. The introduction of Juliet <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>killer,</b> and Jack raging against the Others is fun. But many of the big revelations -- Ben's name, for example -- aren't very well handled." [...] On a similar list, IGN ranked the episode at number 38; they called the opening [...] "one of the show's characteristic fake-outs", and Jack's flashbacks [...] "not nearly as interesting as his first encounters with Juliet".|$|E
500|$|Benson {{followed}} Gardner's {{pattern of}} setting Bond {{in the contemporary}} timeframe of the 1990s and, according to Jeremy Black, had more echoes of Fleming's style than John Gardner, he also changed Bond's gun back to the Walther PPK, put him {{behind the wheel of}} a Jaguar XK8 and made him swear more. James Harker noted that [...] "whilst Fleming's Bond had been an Express reader; Benson's is positively red top. He's the first to have group sex... and the first to visit a prostitute", whilst Black notes an increased level of crudity lacking in either Fleming or Gardner. In a 1998 interview Benson described his version of Bond as a more ruthless and darker character, stating that [...] "Bond is not a nice guy. Bond <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>killer...</b> He is an anti-hero." ...|$|E

500|$|Author and {{journalist}} Heidi Stringell finds Flagg [...] "an embodiment of pure evil", contending that King sees {{good and evil}} as “real forces”; Flagg’s embodiment of evil is confirmed {{by the fact that}} [...] "he <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>killer,</b> a maker of mischief, a liar, and a tempter". To Stringell, Flagg’s disappearance at the end of The Stand shows that “evil ultimately leads nowhere”. The author calls Flagg a [...] "generic hybrid" [...] of the archetypical [...] "Dark Man and the Trickster". To her, the combination of these two characteristics found in different cultural realms forces people to face their [...] "flawed humanity" [...] with the [...] "amorality” Flagg represents. Jenifer Paquette, author of Respecting The Stand: A Critical Analysis of Stephen King's Apocalyptic Novel, writes that [...] "Flagg's horror is that he looks like an ordinary man, and his behavior is a mockery of humanity—a terrible insight into the human psyche. King suggests that the thing to fear the most is inside ourselves." ...|$|E
500|$|The audio mixing {{was done}} by Demacio Castellon while the Pro Tools editing was {{arranged}} by Ron Taylor from Warner Bros. Records. The chorus of the song has Madonna singing the line [...] "My love's a revolver, my sex <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>killer,</b> do you wanna die happy?" [...] Wayne has a verse {{towards the end of}} the song, and sings the lines with reference to ammunitions, and Auto-Tune is used in his vocals. According to Houston Chronicle, the song is electropop in its composition style. The song is set in the time signature of common time, with a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute. As per the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing Co., Inc., the song is composed in the key of B minor, with Madonna's voice spanning from the tonal nodes of A3 to E5. [...] "Revolver" [...] follows in the basic sequence of Bm–D–A–Bm–D–A as its chord progression.|$|E
500|$|The {{first season}} of Dexter {{is based on}} the novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter by Jeff Lindsay. However, there are {{numerous}} differences, ranging from extra subplots to rearrangements and modifications of elements from the source material. The biggest change is the lead-up to and revelation of the identity of the [...] "Ice Truck Killer", called the [...] "Tamiami Butcher" [...] in the novel. In the novel, Dexter is led to believe that he might be the one committing the murders, due to a series of strange dreams that connect him to the murder. The final clue is a blurry photo, taken from surveillance footage, of a man who resembles Dexter at a crime scene. After the [...] "Tamiami Killer" [...] kidnaps Deborah, Dexter finds and confronts him. It is subsequently revealed that the killer is actually Dexter's nearly identical long-lost brother, Brian, who, like Dexter, witnessed their mother's brutal murder. Dexter is followed by Detective LaGuerta, who is slain by Brian. Debra finds out her brother <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>killer</b> and Dexter helps Brian to escape. In the television series, Brian is introduced under the fake name Rudy, a prosthetist who becomes Debra's boyfriend. Dexter hesitantly kills Brian instead of letting him escape, Debra does not discover her brother's secret, and LaGuerta is not present at all in the confrontation. In the novel, Dexter and his brother are nearly identical, whereas the actors playing the two characters are distinct from each other in their looks.|$|E

500|$|Three months later, the EPB {{issued a}} joint press release with the PRT and the PRTP announcing {{the death of}} one of its members, William Pintado Burgos. After {{emphasizing}} that he had joined the armed resistance from a young age as a believer in independence and socialism, the organizations proceeded to posthumously grant him the title of Commander of the Puerto Rican Revolution, which is only granted to those that are deemed to have [...] "stood firm and battled the motherland's enemy". Months later, on the birthday of Ramón Emeterio Betances, the EBP joined Jornada Betances in a homage to the Puerto Rican students involved in the protests against the Fortuño administration. Remembering that September 23, 1868, is now celebrated as [...] "the birth of the Puerto Rican nation", having been the date of the Cry of Lares when Betances and several other revolted against Spain and proclaimed the first Republic of Puerto Rico under Francisco Ramírez Medina, the group insisted {{that it was time to}} do the same as that day. Citing Pedro Albizu Campos's phrase [...] "it's difficult to give a speech while the mother is lying on bed and there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>killer</b> prowling", the Macheteros anthropomorphized the influence of the United States as that murderer and labeled the Via Verde project and cases of government corruption as examples of actions being taken against the motherland, urging the public to mimic the actions of Lares. Blaming Fortuño, Figueroa Sancha and Fraticelli for a violent response to the UPR strike, the EPB congratulated the students for precipitating a negotiation procedure. Despite this, the organization urged the public to continue its resistance against the measures adopted by the Fortuño administration. The Macheteros also informed that they were [...] "gathering strength, preparing the stage and studying" [...] its opponents, quoting Betances' strategy of patiently and convertly planning every revolutionary action before executing them. The group stated that public education would be defended by [...] "an army of students and communities". The EBP concluded its statement by warning that [...] "the enemy was to be confronted with proper planning and intelligence [...] knowing when to strike". In lobbying for an unified national front, the Macheteros insisted that to accomplish independence the only way to do it was by following the armed resistance promoted by Betances, Albizu, Corretjer and Ojeda Ríos.|$|E

We believe that Pukach <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>killer</b> and should serve his sentence". Telychenko blamed former First Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine Renat Kuzmin for [...] "speculating with the Gongadze case" [...] that according to her led to [...] "exhausting Pukach length of stay in detention during the preliminary investigation".|$|E

2500|$|Allen {{tried to}} {{recapture}} the success of Family with Hothouse for ABC in 1988; the drama about the lives and work experiences of the staff of a mental hospital lasted eight episodes. Personally Allen thought it was some of her best work, though its short life was a mixed blessing for her, said Allen: [...] "Unfortunately, ABC didn't have the courage of their initial convictions. They skewered it, they turned tail on it. However if they had picked it up I'd have had to turn out 26 episodes. I'd be in Forest Lawn now.

2500|$|Lynsey {{gets back}} into Silas's [...] "bad books" [...] {{when he finds}} her looking at his {{hospital}} records. Silas then tries to scare Lynsey off with a menacing warning. In August 2011, Rawle confirmed that Silas would start terrorising Lynsey. Rawle explained that Silas is intent on discrediting Lynsey as she knows he <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>killer.</b> He said [...] " [...] job {{over the next few}} weeks, it's like a war of attrition - [...] going to wear her down and send her mad." [...] Lynsey is determined to see Silas punished for his crimes as the investigation into India's murder gathers pace. Of this, Hassan told Inside Soap [...] "When Silas realises that Lynsey is on his case again, he basically tells her to bring it on." [...] Silas [...] "gets off" [...] on the idea that Lynsey is trying to stop him from killing again and Hassan said [...] "it makes the game a lot more interesting". Lynsey's suspicions are reconfirmed when she sees Silas among the press at a televised appeal about India's attacker. Lynsey frames Silas by planting India's necklace on him before ringing the police anonymously. Hassan said that Lynsey hopes Silas's [...] "web of lies" [...] will unravel. Lynsey's attempt to frame him backfires.|$|E
2500|$|Hitchcock's {{films were}} diverse during the 1940s, {{ranging from the}} romantic comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith (1941), to the {{courtroom}} drama The Paradine Case (1947), to the bleak film noir Shadow of a Doubt (1943). In September 1940 the Hitchcocks bought the [...] Cornwall Ranch near Scotts Valley in the Santa Cruz Mountains. The ranch became the holiday home of the Hitchcocks. Their primary residence was an English-style home in Bel Air which was purchased in 1942. Suspicion (1941) marks Hitchcock's first film as a producer as well as director. It is set in England, and Hitchcock used the north coast of Santa Cruz, California for the English coastline sequence. This film {{is the first of}} four projects on which Cary Grant worked with Hitchcock, and {{it is one of the}} rare occasions that Grant was cast in a sinister role. Joan Fontaine won Best Actress Oscar for her performance. Grant plays a penniless dishonest con-artist whose actions raise suspicion and anxiety in his shy young English wife (Fontaine). In one scene Hitchcock uses a lightbulb to illuminate what might be a fatal glass of milk that Grant is bringing to his wife. The character that Grant plays in the film <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>killer</b> in the book upon which the film was based, Before the Fact by Francis Iles, but Hitchcock and the studio felt that, among other issues, Grant's image would be tarnished by that. So Hitchcock settled for an ambiguous finale, although, as he stated to François Truffaut, a murder would have suited him better.|$|E
60|$|The {{child is}} {{father to the}} man. In the light of this {{instinct}} how easy to understand his boyish cruelty. He is true to nature. Unlimited and infinite in his imagination when he hunts--whether with his toys or with real weapons. If he flings a stone and kills a toad he is instinctively killing meat for {{his home in the}} cave. How little difference between the lad and the man! For a man the most poignantly exciting, the most thrillingly wild is the chase when he is weaponless, when he runs and kills his quarry with a club. Here we have the essence of the matter. The hunter is proudest of his achievement in which he has not had the help of deadly weapons. Unconsciously he will brag and glow over that conquest wherein lay greatest peril to him--when he had nothing but his naked hands. What a hot gush of blood bursts over him! He goes back to his barbarian state when a man only felt. The savage lived in his sensations. He saw, heard, smelled, tasted, touched, but seldom thought. The earthy, the elemental of eye and ear and skin surrounded him. When the man goes into the wilderness to change into a hunter that surviving kinship with the savage revives in his being, and all unconsciously dominates him with driving passion. Passion it is because for long he has been restrained in the public haunts of men. His real nature has been hidden. The hunting of game inhibits his thoughts. He feels only. He forgets himself. He sees the track, he hears the stealthy step, he smells the wild scent; and his blood dances with the dance of the ages. Then he <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>killer.</b> Then the ages roll back. Then he is brother to the savage. Then all unconsciously he lives the chase, the fight, the death-dealing moment as they were lived by all his ancestors down through the misty past.|$|E
