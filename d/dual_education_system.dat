30|$|The {{analyses}} initially {{confirmed that}} the interest displayed in the different sub-areas of vocational education and training is distinctly gender specific. Male adolescents show a much greater interest in company-based and <b>dual</b> <b>education</b> and training, while female adolescents show a greater interest in school-based education and training. There is strong evidence for {{the significance of the}} career choice theory of Gottfredson (1981). Male adolescents have better opportunities when entering company-based or <b>dual</b> <b>education</b> and training; conversely, female adolescents {{have a better chance of}} entering school-based vocational education and training. When looking at the overall outcome, i.e., entry into vocational training that leads to a full vocational qualification, no disadvantages in terms of opportunity for male adolescents compared to female adolescents were identified. We attribute this result to the particular characteristics of the <b>dual</b> <b>education</b> and training <b>system,</b> dominant in terms of size. This offers a scope of occupational interests that are male oriented and thus makes access significantly easier for male adolescents than for female adolescents.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{foresight}} study of alternative futures for Institutes of Technology within the Irish higher <b>education</b> <b>system.</b> The {{research focuses on}} the potential role and functions for the Institute of Technology sector in 2020. A strategic foresight methodology employing scenario design as the theoretical framework is applied. The general goals and contribution of the research are: to present foresight as a strategic methodology; to record developments and present a. snapshot' of the operating environment of the Institutes of Technology, including higher education trends, and agendas to 2010, and subsequently 2020; to present scenario narratives and alternative future paths for the Institutes of Technology to 2020; and, finally, to invite discussion on the future alternatives for the role and functions of the Institutes of Technology. The key purpose is to offer insights that may assist policy makers in choosing appropriate strategies for higher education in Ireland in 2020. The research identifies two significant challenges (critical uncertainties) relevant to the future determination of the role and functions of the Institutes of Technology for 2020, namely {{the structure of the}} higher <b>education</b> <b>system</b> and the relevance of teaching and/or research. As a consequence, four alternative scenarios are outlined: Stratocumulus, a <b>dual</b> higher <b>education</b> <b>system</b> consisting of Community Colleges that are aligned with and act as feeder colleges to the traditional research-orientated Universities; Altostratus, a stratified higher <b>education</b> <b>system</b> consisting of National Technological Universities and traditional research Universities; Altocumulus, a binary higher <b>education</b> <b>system</b> consisting of regionally aligned Institutes of Technology and traditional research-orientated Universities; and, Cirrostratus, a unitary higher <b>education</b> <b>system</b> consisting solely of Universities, where a hierarchy based on reputation has emerged in relation to research.

40|$|This study {{extends the}} {{comparative}} model of country groups to analyse the cross-national {{trends in the}} higher education expansion and opportunities. We use descriptive data on characteristics and outcomes of higher <b>education</b> <b>systems</b> in different countries groups, including the liberal market countries, the social democratic countries, the Mediterranean countries, the German-speaking countries, the Northern states, and the East Asian societies. At the theoretical level, we assess {{the validity of the}} maximally maintained inequality (MMI) theory in the cross-national contexts. We confirm the MMI theory in general patterns of the expansion of higher education opportunities; however, we argue that it is not sufficient to provide accounts on specific country differences in the strength of the relationship between participation rates and inequality of opportunities. Therefore, we explain the divergences from the general pattern of higher participation being associated with lower inequality. We propose three main contenders including the private contribution to higher education, less hierarchical higher <b>education</b> <b>systems,</b> and the participation in the <b>dual</b> higher <b>education</b> <b>system</b> and greater public support and entitlements. We use a series of indicators on the trends of participation in higher education and different types of universities, the private contribution to higher education, and the trends of public support and entitlements to assess the three contenders. Thus, we argue that there are different patterns of the trade-offs between expansion and equalising opportunities. Most rapid expansion is observed in countries with high private contributions to higher education and little government support for students mainly because governments can then afford more places but equalisation of opportunities from the expansion in these systems is limited because of financial barriers to access to less well-off groups. Most egalitarian systems seem to have somewhat lower participation rates with lower fees and strong government support such as the social democratic and the German-speaking countries...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2008. Focus This thesis investigates {{inclusive}} education {{policy and practice}} in South Africa. In this context, particular focus {{is given to the}} rights and needs of visually impaired learners and students. Background Due to the <b>dual</b> segregated <b>education</b> <b>system,</b> as at 2001, approximately 280 000 disabled children did not have access to education at school. The special schools system fostered inequality and discrimination of disabled learners from an early age. This stood in tension with the South African Constitution and was not in line with international trends. This ‘normative tension’ and lack of alignment with evolving international practice led to a shift towards an inclusive <b>education</b> <b>system</b> as a policy preference. Policy In 1996 the Constitution and the South African Schools Act prescribed that everyone had the right to basic education and should not be discriminated against on any grounds. Mainstream schools catered for able-bodied learners, and existing legislation did not automatically equip schools and teachers with resources and training to accommodate disabled learners. To enable directives to obtain these objectives, Education White Paper 6 was passed in 2001. This policy documented Government’s intent to implement an inclusive <b>education</b> <b>system</b> by 2021. Investigation The educational needs of visually impaired learners were identified and discussed. An analysis of White Paper 6, highlighting its strengths and limitations in light of the identified specialised educational needs, was conducted. Research was undertaken in mainstream schools, special schools and universities to assess the progress of the implementation process. Challenges impeding the process including untrained educators, insufficient funding, and no established provisioning norms were identified. Inclusive education has its foundations within social rights theory. Education, like other basic social rights is a justiciable right which the State must uphold. However, like all normative wish lists of rights, limited resources, competing claimants and policy trade-offs are inevitable, more especially in a developing country. As a result budgets, utilisation of funds and accountability of the Department of Education were also investigated. Conclusion Following an analysis of the contents of the policy and findings on the progress of the implementation process, policy recommendations- informed by the researchwere proposed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn Denmark, Germany and {{a number}} of other {{countries}} Vocational Education and Training is based on the principle of <b>dual</b> <b>education.</b> This means that the apprentices spend one part of their education and training at a vocational school and another part in a company or firm directly involved in ordinary working life. The close connection to working life implies that the transition from being apprentice to becoming a trained employee is relatively easy compared to school based VET systems. The principle of <b>dual</b> <b>education</b> within VET is known worldwide for its ability to provide the labour market with highly qualified labour which is able to adjust to new and changing conditions and introduction of new technology. Furthermore skilled labour educated and trained according to <b>dual</b> <b>education</b> has a very high mobility on the labour market. <b>Dual</b> <b>education</b> secures tight connections between the educational system and businesses and enterprises because of the involvement in the educational processes and finally the principal of <b>dual</b> <b>education</b> is a relatively cheap way to educate skilled labour compared to school based educational systems within VET. The economic crisis put pressure on the principle of <b>dual</b> <b>education</b> within vocational education and training (VET) because the firms and companies are less motivated to provide the necessary number of training places for the apprentices. On the one hand this causes problems for the young people wanting to take a vocational education as they are not able to finalize it without access to a proper training place. On the other hand it provides problems for businesses and enterprises because there will be a shortage of skilled labour in the future. In this paper a number of approaches to comply with this challenge from countries which organize their VET on the basis of <b>dual</b> <b>education</b> are presented. The examples come from Denmark, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Holland and Norway. The purpose of the paper is to provide knowledge and inspiration across countries about different ways of handling the principle of <b>dual</b> <b>education</b> in difficult economic situations and to create a basis for making the principle less fragile during economic down turns. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Academic {{self-concept}} {{relates to}} students' {{perceptions of their}} academic accomplishments, and academic competence and expectations of academic success or failure. Academic self-concept {{has been identified as}} being critical for academic success in school as it underpins educational aspirations, academic interest, course selection, and achievement over time. Twice-exceptional students are intellectually gifted with a coexisting disability and hence present as a <b>dual</b> paradox for <b>education</b> <b>systems,</b> both in terms of being gifted and having a disability. The paradox of two, or one, or neither of the exceptionalities being visible in a child in school is due primarily to outward behaviours, lack of community knowledge, and challenges with identification (Vail, 1989). Despite over twenty years of empirical research on twice-exceptional students, the influences on academic self-concept remains virtually unexplored. This research investigates teachers' influences on the school experience of twice-exceptional students and how these influences shape academic self-concept. A case study research design includes both quantitative instrument data and interview data. Findings provide new understandings about teachers' influences on academic self-concept for twice-exceptional students. This research contributes to a gap in the field and leads to a better understanding that can be applied to policy and practice for gifted education.

40|$|The {{number of}} high school age {{students}} who do not complete high school is receiving increased attention as a serious challenge facing the educational system. This is happening for several reasons. New research estimates that about 30 percent {{of high school}} students fail to earn a diploma in the standard number of years, a higher figure than state and local education officials typically cite. In many states, barely half of African-Americans and Latinos graduate from high school. The magnitude of the challenge is becoming clear {{at the same time that}} a consensus is emerging that education beyond high school is critical to economic self-sufficiency and success in today's knowledge-intensive economy.
