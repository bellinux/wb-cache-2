30|$|In the {{remainder}} of this paper, we show how an upwelling provides the framework for the development of (1) each patch that is detected by a ground-based sensor, and (2) each cluster of EPBs that is encountered by a satellite-borne instrument. We conclude that an upwelling {{can be viewed as a}} unit of disturbance in ESF. To place this kind of description in context, we note that usage of the term ‘convective ionospheric storm’ to refer to ESF has increased (e.g., Makela et al. 2005, 2006; Kelley et al. 2005, 2009, 2011). If the research community chooses to accept this terminology, it may be reasonable to refer to the process, which takes place within an upwelling, as a convective <b>ionospheric</b> <b>substorm.</b>|$|E
40|$|We present {{multi-point}} {{observations of}} a substorm {{which took place}} on 29 August 2004. The near-Earth magnetotail dynamics were observed by Cluster C 1 and Double Star TC 1, in conjunction with observations of the Northern Hemisphere ionospheric convection flow from the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (Super- DARN), of the Southern Hemisphere auroral morpholo- gy from the Wideband Imaging Camera of the Far Ul- traviolet instrument onboard the Imager for Magneto- pause-to-Aurora Global Exploration spacecraft (IMAGE FUV/WIC), and of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>substorm</b> currents from the Greenland magnetometer chain. Following the substorm growth phase, expansion phase onset results in the closure of open magnetic flux for 3 hours, prolonged by continued creation of open flux at the dayside. The 3 -hour duration of the substorm was punctuated by 5 dipolarizations which we interpret as individual bursts of reconnection, each closing ~ 0. 125 GWb of flux. As- sociated with each dipolarization were auroral en- hancements, convection enhancements and a step-wise poleward progression of the substorm current wedge. We derive the amount of open flux in the magnetos- phere from observations of the ionospheric polar cap, along with the corresponding rates of dayside and night- side reconnection. From these we can model the chang- ing length of the magnetotail and variations in its radius, flaring, and lobe field strength {{during the course of}} the growth and expansion phases of the substorm. Despite the simplicity of this modeling, we demonstrate good agreement between predicted lobe field strength and the observations of Cluster...|$|E

(2009 a) {{studied the}} {{relationship}} between smaller scale auroral features observed minutes prior to auroral breakup and the onset of Pi 1 - 2 ULF waves observed by both Milling et al. (2008) and Murphy et al. (2009 a, b). After identifying the onset arc, Akasofu (1964) and Rae et al. (2009 a, b) showed that the onset of Pi 1 - 2 ULF waves occurred {{at the same time}} and in the same location as “auroral beads” (Henderson 1994) which developed azimuthally along the onset arc. Rae et al. (2009 b) and Walsh et al. (2010) went on to demonstrate the rapid connectivity of the equatorial magnetosphere to the ionosphere during substorm onset, showing that the Pi 1 - 2 ULF onset observed on the ground and at the conjugate point in the equatorial magnetosphere occurred within the timing uncertainty defined by the AWESOME algorithm. Further studies of the onset of the ULF waves shows that the exponential growth in ULF wave amplitudes occurs immediately prior to the onset of an auroral substorm (Rae et al. 2011). Finally, it has been shown that both the ULF wave amplitudes and auroral brightness grow exponentially at the location of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>substorm</b> onset (Rae et al. 2012; Kalmoni et al. 2015, 2017). Although {{the relationship between}} the enhancement of ULF waves and auroral brightness is no longer in doubt (see review by Rae and Watt 2016), the relative timing and localisation of Pi 1, Pi 1 - 2 and Pi 2 waves across the auroral zone at substorm onset have not yet been investigated.|$|E
40|$|A global {{substorm}} electrodynamic {{model and}} a global ionospheric model were coupled {{in order to}} study <b>ionospheric</b> dynamics during <b>substorms,</b> with the focus on small-scale substorm electrodynamic and plasma structures. The simulation results show that in the expansion phase, structured precipitation and channeled field-aligned currents quickly develop in the substorm onset region. The Hall and Pedersen conductance ratio in the region increases significantly, and the magnetospheric field-aligned currents are mainly closed by highly structured Hall currents. Correspondingly, the plasma in the ionosphere also undergoes significant changes during a substorm and is highly structured in both the horizontal and vertical directions. In the substorm onset region, there are spatially separated small-scale Ti and Te hot spots, downward ExB drifts, decreased total electron contents, and a lowered ionosphere. Also, {{there is a significant}} O+ → NO+ conversion, leading to a great increase of NO+ and a lowering of the O+ peak height. These small-scale electrodynamic and plasma structures are very important for more realistically simulating the <b>ionospheric</b> dynamics during <b>substorms.</b> These results not only help to elucidate the multiscale <b>ionospheric</b> responses to <b>substorms</b> but also provide a theoretical guidance and cautions for the interpretation of various substorm observational data...|$|R

The evidence indicates that magnetotail processes initiate the sequence of events called a substorm, while the ionosphere appears to {{play a critical role in}} the subsequent evolution of the substorm expansion phase. However, the necessary observations, in particular high time resolution coordinated observations in the ionosphere and magnetotail are relatively rare.

We then detail how these observations relate to dynamical magnetospheric processes, and show how they constrain models of transient convection. Next, we pull together observations and models of Pi 2 generation, substorm current wedge (SCW) initiation and dipolarization to present a self-consistent description of the dynamical processes and communicative pathways that occur just prior to and during substorm expansion onset.

Analysis of the optical frequency and along-arc (azimuthal) wave number spectra provides the strongest constraint to date on the potential mechanisms and instabilities in the near-Earth magnetosphere that accompany auroral onset and which precede poleward arc expansion and auroral breakup. We evaluate the frequency and growth rates of the auroral forms as a function of azimuthal wave number to determine whether these wave characteristics are consistent with current models of the substorm onset mechanism. We find that the frequency, spatial scales, and growth rates of the auroral forms are most consistent with the cross-field current instability or a ballooning instability, most likely triggered close to the inner edge of the ion plasma sheet. This result is supportive of a near-Earth plasma sheet initiation of the substorm expansion phase.

40|$|We present {{case studies}} of the {{evolution}} of magnetic wave amplitudes and auroral intensity through the late growth phase and the expansion phase of the substorm cycle. We present strong evidence that substorm-related auroral enhancements are clearly and demonstrably linked to ULF wave amplitudes observed at the same location. In most cases, we find that the highest correlations are observed when the magnetometer time series is advanced in time, indicating that the ULF wave amplitudes start to grow before measured auroral intensities, though interestingly this is not always the case. Further we discuss the four possible reasons that may be able to explain both the timing and the high correlations between these two phenomena, including: a simple coincidence, an artifact of instrumental effects, the response of the ionosphere to magnetic waves and auroral particle precipitation, and finally that ULF waves and auroral particle precipitation are physically linked. We discount coincidence and instrumental effects since in the studies presented here they are unlikely or in general will contribute negligible effects, and we find that the ionospheric response to waves and precipitation can explain some, but not all of the results contained within this paper. Specifically, <b>ionospheric</b> response to <b>substorm</b> waves and auroral precipitation cannot explain that the result that previous studies have shown, that onset of ULF wave activity and the onset of auroral particle precipitation occur {{at the same time and}} in the same location.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{data from the}} Sweden And Britain Radar Experiment is {{examined}} in a statistical investigation of the variation of the radar backscatter amplitude due to variations in the ionospheric convection. The response of the radar backscatter is examined over an eight year interval from 1982 until 1989 and a strong dependence of the variation of the backscatter amplitude on flow direction and magnitude determined during the solar cycle. The results are discussed with reference to three geophysical parameters which control {{the relationship between the}} backscatter intensity and Doppler velocity, namely the ambient electron density, the electron density fluctuation amplitude and the dimensions of the scattering layer. Data from the SABRE system is further utilised in two studies involving three distinct types of transient perturbations of the <b>ionospheric</b> convection pattern. <b>Substorm</b> Associated Radar Auroral Surges (SARAS) are examined in a statistical manner to obtain a more complete description of the feature.

Characterisation of the VHF radar signature resulting from the passage of this o band structure allows a link between a second o band and a radar flow burst signature to be made. It is suggested that a flow burst signature is observed coincident with the western (trailing edge) of the luminous region of an eastward drifting o band.

40|$|Observations of ionospheric {{convection}} {{have proven}} to be extremely valuable in understanding the interaction between the solar wind and the magnetosphere, particularly through the process of magnetic reconnection. In addition, the response of <b>ionospheric</b> convection to <b>substorm</b> activity can provide insight into the mechanisms associated with magnetospheric substorms. In this paper we review observations of ionospheric convection during all phases of the substorm made by HF coherent scatter radars such as those that form the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN). By concentrating on HF coherent scatter radar observations we stress the importance of ion velocity measurements rather than the conductance controlled ionospheric electrojets. The observations reviewed in this paper demonstrate a number of key results. Following long periods of quiet magnetic activity usually associated with intervals of northward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), the region of radai backscatter in the dusk local time sector moves equatorward. Based upon this motion of the radar backscatter and a model for the reconnection rate at the dayside magnetopause, it is possible to estimate the length of the reconnection line at the magnetopause, which is found to vary between 12 and 27 R_E. At expansion phase onset, the scatter can often be lost for short periods of time due to absorption of the HF radio wave. There is also evidence that convection vortices in the post noon local time sector relax at the time of expansion phase onset, which hints at a global response to the expansion phase onset. During {{the latter part of the}} expansion phase bursts of flow are seen to occur which have repetition rates similar to flux transfer events (FTEs) and current vortices similar to the ionospheric signatures of FTEs. HF coherent scatter radars also play a key role in multi-instrument studies of magnetospheric substorms, for example providing near continuous observations of the convection reversal boundary as a proxy for the polar cap boundary. The recovery phase is the least studied of the various phases but there are key observations of omega bands in the post midnight local time sector, which also hint at the expansion phase being a global phenomenon. The paper concludes with some suggestions of how HF coherent scatter radars will be used in future studies of convection during substorms...|$|R
