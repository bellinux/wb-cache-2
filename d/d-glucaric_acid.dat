50|$|Unlike {{their parent}} sugars, aldaric acids {{have the same}} {{functional}} group {{at both ends of}} their carbon chain; therefore, two different sugars can yield the same aldaric acid (this can be understood by looking at the Fischer projection of a sugar upside down—with normal aldoses, this is a different compound due to the aldehyde function at the top and the hydroxyl function at the bottom, but with aldaric acids, there is a carboxylic acid function on both ends, so upside down and right side up do not matter). For example, <b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid</b> and L-gularic acid are the same compound. A consequence of this is that some aldaric acids are meso forms with no optical activity despite their multiple chiral centers—this occurs if a sugar and its enantiomer oxidize to the same aldaric acid. An example is D-galactose—it has four chiral centers, but D-galactaric and L-galactaric acids, which have the opposite configuration at each chiral center and therefore would be expected to be enantiomers, are actually the same compound; therefore, galactaric acid is an achiral meso form with no optical activity. Again, this can be understood by taking the Fischer projection of either acid and looking at it upside down—the configuration is now switched at every carbon.|$|E

40|$|<b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid</b> is a {{naturally}} occurring compound {{which has been}} explored for a plethora of potential uses, including biopolymer production, cancer and diabetes treatment, cholesterol reduction, and {{as a replacement for}} polyphosphates in detergents. This molecule was identified in 2004 as a "Top Value-Added Chemical from Biomass" by the U. S. Department of Energy (Werpy and Petersen, 2004), implying that production of <b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid</b> could be economically feasible if biomass were used as a feedstock. A biosynthetic route to <b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid</b> from D-glucose has been constructed in E. coli by our group (Moon et al., 2009 b), and the goal of this thesis has been to improve the economic viability of this biological production route through improvements to pathway productivity and yield. One part of this thesis involved the application of metabolic engineering strategies towards improving <b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid</b> productivity. These strategies targeted MIOX, which had been identified previously as the least active pathway enzyme. Directed evolution of MIOX led to the isolation of a 941 bp DNA fragment which increased <b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid</b> production 65 % from a myo-inositol feed. Fusion of MIOX to SUMO, a eukaryotic post-translational protein tag, significantly increased soluble expression and stability, resulting in a 75 % increase in <b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid</b> production from a myo-inositol feed. A second part of this thesis attempted to apply synthetic biology strategies towards improving pathway productivity. Manual, delayed expression of MIOX via time-resolved addition of chemical inducers was shown to improve productivity approximately five-fold. However, inducers are generally too costly for use in industrial production processes, so we attempted to develop genetic circuits which could delay MIOX expression autonomously, eliminating the need for costly chemical inducers. Although the attempts to create robust, controllable genetic timers in this thesis were unsuccessful, these attempts provided significant insight into limitations currently preventing widespread application of synthetic biology devices to metabolic engineering problems. A third part of this thesis explored strain engineering as a strategy for improving the yield of <b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid</b> on D-glucose. Deletion of pgi and zwf was demonstrated to prevent E. coli from consuming D-glucose as well as eliminate catabolite repression effects in the presence of D-glucose. Finally, both <b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid</b> productivity and yield were shown to be increased significantly in this [Delta]pgi [Delta]zwf strain. Overall, this thesis reports significant strides towards commercially viable titers of <b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid</b> as well as interesting avenues of research for further pathway improvements. by Eric Chun-Jen Shiue.

40|$|On July 10, 1976, an {{explosion}} in a factory in Seveso, Italy, located 30 km north of Milan, producing trichlorophenol caused the release of TCDD-containing compounds in the surrounding area. Since extremely small doses of TCDD {{have been shown to}} induce hepatic microsomal enzymes in animals, urinary <b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid</b> excretion (a measurable index of enzyme induction), has been investigated in Seveso in adults and children 6 to 8 years old, in order to clarify whether levels of environmental exposure to TCDD were sufficient to produce an induction in man. Urine samples were collected from 1976 to 1981. As a control group, people living in Cannero (a nonindustrialized village on lake Magiore), in Busto Arsizio (a small industrial town near Milan) and in Lentate (a noncontaminated zone near Seveso) were chosen. In the first period of collection, children with chloracne (which {{is considered to be a}} characteristic manifestation of intoxication with chlorinated products) showed significantly increased levels of <b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid</b> excretion compared to children without chloracne living in the same zone. As far as chronic exposure is concerned, up to 3 years after the accident both adults and children living in the Seveso area showed a statistically significant enhancement of <b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid</b> elimination compared to the control groups. This study demonstrates that adults and children living in the polluted zones had an increased activity of hepatic microsomal enzymes for some years, since, although the urinary excretion of <b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid</b> is only an indirect measure of enzyme activity, studies in man have indicated that it is, however, sensitive and quantitative.

40|$|Abstract The {{equilibrium}} of aqueous <b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid</b> {{was investigated}} via Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The NMR spectra {{of all four}} species (<b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid,</b> D-glucaro- 1, 4 -lactone, D-glucaro- 6, 3 - lactone and D-glucaro- 1, 4; 6, 3 -lactone) were assigned. A 1 H NMR spectroscopy method was developed to investigate the kinetics of equilibration of the starting species (D-glucaro- 1, 4 -lactone and D-glucaro- 1, 4; 6, 3 -dilactone). The equilibration was investigated under neutral conditions as well as conditions with increasing acidity. Each experiment set contained 50 - 100 1 HNMR spectroscopy experiments that were run on the same sample using a program that built in delays. Dimethyl sulfoxide {{was used as an}} internal standard, and its signal size was used as a scale to report the changes in relative concentration of the four species throughout the experiment sets. Under neutral conditions D-glucaro- 1, 4 -lactone is relatively stable against equilibration, while D-glucaro- 1, 4; 6, 3 -dilactone is not. Under acidic conditions both compounds equilibrate within approximately 30, 000 seconds. After equilibration under acidic conditions <b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid</b> is the dominant species, while the relative concentration of D-glucaro- 1, 4 -lactone is slightly higher than that of D-glucaro- 6, 3 -lactone. The relative equilibrium concentration of D-glucaro- 1, 4; 6, 3 -dilactone is low. A mechanism for the equilibration of aqueous <b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid</b> was proposed and equilibrium constants and estimates of rate constants were derived from the experimental data. These rate constants were used in MATLAB simulations that were compared to the experimental data.

In the other group of seven patients, the urinary excretion of <b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid</b> (isolated by ion-exchange chromatography) was 60 % lower than in the control group of nine humans, whereas in four patients taking antiepileptic agents excretion rate was higher than control values. 4. Because the age distribution was markedly different between cardiac insufficiency and control groups, it is difficult to conclude, if the impairment of drug metabolism was a consequence of the old age or of the disease process. However, drug-oxidizing enzyme systems seem to be inducible also in old age. 5.

In liver, limonoids that induced phase II enzyme activity were limonin- 7 - methoxime (32 % CBNB), (270 % 4 NQO), (65 % QR); and deacetylnomilin (180 % QR). In stomach, limonin- 7 -methoxime (51 % 4 NQO); deacetyl nomilinic acid glucoside (55 % 4 NQO), nomilin (58 % CDNB), (75 % 4 NQO); isoobacunoic acid (25 % CDNB); deacetylnomilin (19 % CDNB); limonoid mixture (45 % 4 NQO), (200 % QR). Furthermore, in intestine, nomilin (280 % 4 NQO); deacetylnomilin (73 % 4 NQO), (22 % QR); and the limonoid mixture (93 % 4 NQO) increase enzymatic activity. Finally in lung, deacetyl nomilinic acid glucoside (67 % CDNB); limonin- 7 -methoxime (32 % QR); and defuran limonin (45 % QR) diplayed induction properties.

Anticonvulsant drugs are known to have inducing properties, and since folate is required as a cofactor in drug hydroxylations it is suggested that folate depletion results from increased demand for the cofactor after induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes.

40|$|Synthetic {{biology is}} an {{evolving}} field that emphasizes synthesis more than observation {{which has been}} and is the scientific method for traditional biology. With powerful synthetic tools, synthetic biologists seek to reproduce natural behaviors (and eventually to create artificial life) from unnatural molecules or try to construct unnatural systems from interchangeable parts. Accompanied with this recent movement, metabolic engineers started to utilize these interchangeable parts (enzymes in this case) to create novel pathways. In addition, engineering biological parts including enzymes, promoters, and protein-protein interaction domains has led to productivity improvement. However, understanding behaviors of a synthetic pathway in an engineered chassis is still a daunting task, requiring global optimization. As {{the first step to}} understand pathway design rules and behaviors of synthetic pathways, a synthetic pathway for the production of <b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid</b> has been designed and constructed in E. coli. To this end, three disparate enzymes were recruited from three different organisms, and the system perturbed by this introduction of heterologous genes was analyzed. Limiting flux through the pathway is the second recombinant step, catalyzed by myo-inositol oxygenase (MIOX), whose activity is strongly influenced by the concentration of the myo-inositol substrate. To increase the effective concentration of myo-inositol, synthetic scaffold devices were built from protein-protein interaction domains to co-recruit all three pathway enzymes in a designable complex. (cont.) This colocalization led to enhancement of MIOX activity with concomitant productivity improvement, achieving 2. 7 g/L of <b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid</b> production from 10 g/L of D-glucose input. Secondly, retrobiosynthetic approach, a product-targeted design of biological pathways, has been proposed as an alternative strategy to exploit the diversity of enzymecatalyzed reactions. The first step in a glucaric acid pathway designed retrosynthetically involves oxidation of the C- 6 hydroxyl group on glucose, but no glucose oxidase in nature has been found to act on this hydroxyl group on glucose. To create glucose 6 - oxidase, a computational design and experimental selection was combined with the help of DNA synthesis technology. To this end, the sequence space of candidate mutations was computationally searched, the selected sequences were combinatorially assembled, and the created library was experimentally screened and characterized. Furthermore, the structure-activity relationship of the newly created glucose oxidases was elucidated, and the kinetic model mechanism for these mutants was proposed and analyzed. Collectively, parts, devices, and chassis engineering were applied to a synthetic pathway for the production of <b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid,</b> and this synthetic biology approach was proven to be effective for new pathway design and improvement. by Tae Seok Moon.

Urinary <b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid</b> excretion increased from 60. 6 ± 42. 2 tmoles/ 24 hr to 121. 8 ± 105. 0 moles/ 24 hr over the same time period. Evidence is thus presented that both hepatic {{microsomal oxidation}} and glucuronidation are depressed in the acute phase of kwashiorkor but recover with nutritional rehabilitation. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 32 : 2439 - 2442, 1979. The activity of hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes has been shown in animals to be affected by nutritional status (1). More re-cently, hepatic microsomal oxidative function has been demonstrated to be reduced in both malnourished children and adults (2, 3). Th...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} {{ascertain}} whether the urinary excretion of <b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid</b> (DGA) might be a suitable biomarker of effect in monitoring workers exposed to anaesthetic gases, we measured DGA before and after an operating session (and, in some workers, before and after a 2 -week vacation) in 229 workers of surgical units and in 229 controls. In the former, we also measured urinary levels of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and isoflurane after at least 4 h of exposure. For all subjects, information on age, smoking habits, daily intake of alcohol, coffee, and drugs, history of liver or kidney disease was collected. Study subjects were ranked according to: exposure (class 0 : subjects not exposed; class 1 : N 2 O 1 μg 1 - 1; class 3 : N 2 O > 27 μg l- 1 and isoflurane 27 μg l- 1 and isoflurane > 1 μg l- 1); general habits; and DGA (two groups, below and above the arbitrary cut-off value of 3. 5 mmol mol- 1 creatinine). The relative risk of presenting high DGA excretion was estimated through the Odds Ratio (OR) and 95...|$|E
40|$|Biological {{monitoring}} of genotoxic hazard in the rubber industry {{was performed in}} 19 male workers and 20 age-matched controls in a local health unit in northern Italy. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were analyzed {{for the presence of}} DNA damage (single-cell microgel-electrophoresis, or comet assay) and for cytogenetic parameters (sister chromatid exchanges and micronuclei frequency, and proliferative rate index). The following bioassays were performed in urine samples: a) mutagenicity test and concentration of thioethers as markers of exposure, and b) excretion of <b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid</b> and 6 -beta-hydroxycortisol (related to 17 -hydroxycorticosteroid excretion) as indicators of the inductive status of the microsomal enzyme system (phase-I). The exposed subjects showed statistically higher mean values of 17 -hydroxycorticosteroids and micronuclei and lower values of 6 -beta-hydroxycortisol than controls, when taking cigarette smoking into account. The comet assay showed higher values for migration distance in exposed subjects than controls, although the differences were not significant at a p-value of 0. 05. These findings suggest that industrial exposure in the rubber processing industry may cause genetic damage and may modify the activity level of some enzymes; these results should be considered with caution due to the small number of subjects enrolled...|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of increased drug metabolism activity {{as a consequence}} of multiple drug therapy at a surgical intensive care ward has been studied non-invasively by determinations of daily urinary <b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid</b> (GA) excretion rates. Among 165 randomly selected patients, GA excretion was stimulated in 76 cases (= 46 %). Exploratory data analysis showed that increases in GA excretion are primarily due to administration of barbiturates (pentobarbitone, Nembutal), miconazole (Daktar) and, to a lesser extent, neuroleptics. Surprisingly, the large number of simultaneously administered additional drugs failed to increase GA excretion. Urinary 6 beta-hydroxycortisol (6 beta-OHF) and 17 -hydroxycorticosteroid (17 -OHCS) excretion rates were correlated in 34 patients with GA excretion; patients not receiving known enzyme inducers showed low GA values but high 6 beta-OHF and 17 -OHCS values, however, with a ratio of 6 beta-OHF/ 17 -OHCS in the normal range. Patients receiving high dose pentobarbitone treatment failed to exhibit significantly increased 6 beta-OHF and 17 -OHCS or 6 beta-OHF/ 17 -OHCS values. Miconazole treatment resulted in a significantly increased ratio of 6 beta-OHF/ 17 -OHCS. gamma-Glutamyltranspeptidase activity in serum showed no correlation with GA excretion (n = 91) ...|$|E
40|$|The antipyrine {{clearance}} and the urinary excretion of <b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid</b> (D-GA) {{were determined}} in 122 patients receiving chronic anticonvulsant drug treatment and in 21 drug-free control subjects. Patients treated with carbamazepine (CBZ), phenytoin (DPH), primidone (PMD) and phenobarbitone (PB), either {{alone or in}} combination, showed higher values of antipyrine clearance and excreted larger amounts of D-GA as compared to controls. While antipyrine clearance values {{did not differ significantly}} from one drug group to another, D-GA excretion was significantly higher in patients treated with CBZ than in those treated with DPH. In patients treated with sodium valproate antipyrine clearance did not differ from control values. There was a trend for D-GA excretion to be higher in these patients but the difference was not statistically significant. Significant positive correlations were found between the dosage of CBZ, DPH, PMD and PB and both indices of enzyme induction. These data demonstrate a dose-dependent degree of enzyme induction in patients receiving therapeutic doses of these anticonvulsants. The relative potency at average dose levels for antipyrine clearance was PB (1), DPH (0. 92), CBZ (0. 84), PMD (0. 82) and for log D-GA excretion was PB (1), CBZ (0. 96), PMD (0. 95), DPH (0. 90) ...|$|E
40|$|The Lower North Shore {{region of}} the St. Lawrence River {{is home to a}} {{fish-eating}} population that displays an unusually high body burden of several organochlorines, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxin-like compounds (DLCs). We measured biomarkers indicative of liver enzyme induction and investigated the relationship with organochlorine body burden in adult volunteers from this population. We determined plasma concentrations of PCBs and chlorinated pesticides by high-resolution gas chromatography (HRGC) with electron capture detection. DLC concentrations were measured by the dioxin-receptor chemically activated luciferase expression (DR-CALUX) assay and in a subset of participants, by HRGC/high-resolution mass spectrometry. We measured cotinine, <b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid,</b> and porphyrins in morning urine samples and determined liver CYP 1 A 2 activity in vivo using the caffeine breath test. Neither DLC concentrations as measured by the DR-CALUX nor PCB- 153 concentrations, the latter representing total PCB exposure, were correlated with biomarkers of effects. Smoking (morning urinary cotinine concentration) was positively related to CYP 1 A 2 activity as measured by the caffeine breath test (p < 0. 01). Liver CYP 1 A 2 activity was in turn negatively correlated with PCB- 105 :PCB- 153 and PCB- 118 :PCB- 153 congener ratios (p < 0. 05). Hence, despite the relatively high body burden of PCBs and DLCs in thi...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine if a {{correlation}} exists between cytochrome P- 450 enzyme induction and disease activity {{in patients with}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA), measuring urinary excretion of <b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid</b> (GA) as an index of phase II drug metabolism. METHODS: Patients with RA were treated with sulphasalazine, sodium aurothiomalate, or D-penicillamine in standard dose regimens, for 24 weeks. Patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) or non-inflammatory arthritis (NIA) acted as controls. The urinary GA:creatinine ratio was measured at 0, 12, and 24 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Patients with RA had a slightly greater urinary GA:creatinine ratio than patients with AS or NIA at baseline; this increased during treatment with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Sulphasalazine treatment had a greater effect on GA excretion than sodium aurothiomalate or D-penicillamine; this difference was statistically significant between weeks 0 and 12 (p = 0. 01). Gamma glutamyltranspeptidase concentration showed a weak correlation with GA excretion between weeks 0 and 12 (p = 0. 03), but all other measurements of changes in disease activity (plasma viscosity, C reactive protein, platelets, and articular index) were found not to correlate with GA excretion between weeks 0 - 12 or 0 - 24. CONCLUSION: The increased excretion of GA in patients with RA receiving DMARD treatment is probably {{the result of an}} indirect effect on hepatic metabolism bearing no relationship to disease activity...|$|E
40|$|<b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid</b> {{can be used}} as a {{building}} block for biopolymers as well as in the formulation of detergents and corrosion inhibitors. A biosynthetic route for production in Escherichia coli has been developed (Moon et al., 2009), but previous work with the glucaric acid pathway has indicated that competition with endogenous metabolism may limit carbon flux into the pathway. Our group has recently developed an E. coli strain where phosphofructokinase (Pfk) activity can be dynamically controlled and demonstrated its use for improving yields and titers of the glucaric acid precursor myo-inositol on glucose minimal medium. In this work, we have explored the further applicability of this strain for glucaric acid production in a supplemented medium more relevant for scale-up studies, both under batch conditions and with glucose feeding via in situ enzymatic starch hydrolysis. It was found that glucaric acid titers could be improved by up to 42 % with appropriately timed knockdown of Pfk activity during glucose feeding. The glucose feeding protocol could also be used for reduction of acetate production in the wild type and modified E. coli strains. National Science Foundation (U. S.)

40|$|Abstract Styrene, {{oxidized}} by liver microsomal enzymes, {{can determine}} a liver enzyme induction. Urinary excretion of <b>D-glucaric</b> <b>acid</b> (DGA), which {{is believed to}} estimate this effect, was measured in 27 workers exposed to styrene in a fiberglass plant and in 27 control subjects {{in order to make}} a comparison with environmental and biological exposure indices. In exposed workers, airborne concentrations (8 -h TWA) of styrene varied between 9 and 415 mg/m 3, with styrene metabolites [sum of mandelic acid (MA) + phenylglyoxylic acid (PGA) ] ranging from 93 to 2130 mg/g Cr in endshift urine samples collected on a Thursday, and from 45 to 792 mg/g Cr in samples taken before work the following morning. The correlation coefficient (r) between 8 - h TWAs and sum of urinary metabolites MA + PGA was 0. 92 (y= 4. 06 x - 36. 05; p 200 mg/m 3, respectively, including 10, 7 and 10 workers). The DGA difference between the most exposed and the not exposed subjects was significant (ES-DGA: z= 4. 03 and p< 0. 05; BS- DGA: z= 3. 16 and p< 0. 05; Kruskall-Wallis test), but individual pairwise comparisons among all other groups were not. In spite of the above results, no significant correlation was found between individual exposure to styrene and urinary excretion of DGA, so that this biomarker cannot be used to monitor the exposure effects on an individual basis...|$|E
