500|$|As with {{previous}} Echo & the Bunnymen albums, What Are You Going to Do with Your Life? used the London Metropolitan Orchestra to provide backing music. American alternative hip hop band Fun Lovin' Criminals {{appeared on the}} album as guest musicians on two tracks. Sergeant's guitar-work on the album was understated and he later said, [...] "It was probably the worst time <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>whole</b> <b>life,</b> doing that LP—I hated it [...] I'm on all the tracks here and there, but generally I just stayed in the tent! It was a horrible experience." [...] The album {{is a collection of}} ballads and {{has been described as a}} follow-up to McCulloch's 1989 solo album, Candleland. In a 2005 interview for Record Collector magazine, McCulloch said, [...] "Will [...] hated the album, and I can understand why. He'd ask me where his guitar was supposed to go on certain songs and I'd say, 'Well, nowhere, it doesn't really have a place'." ...|$|E
500|$|At Oxford, Tarwater {{found a new}} {{perspective}} on life: [...] "I {{used to be in the}} sport for Davis Tarwater. [...] Going to Oxford and seeing the selflessness and ambition of the students transitioned me to being in the sport as a mechanism to do good." [...] The Oxford swim team encouraged him to join its ranks, and he subsequently earned most valuable player honors and a Blue jacket, the British equivalent of a varsity letter. On his newfound perspective, Tarwater said, [...] "Missing the Olympics in 2008 was the best thing that's ever happened <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>whole</b> <b>life...</b> I would not have gone to Oxford; I would not have invested in my own personhood... being able to chase an Olympic dream is a gift... I made it a misery. [...] It doesn't have to be a misery." [...] He graduated from Oxford in 2010 with a master's degree in Latin American studies. He described the year at Oxford as the best time of his life.|$|E
500|$|At 21:30 on 12 September, the Japanese cruiser [...] {{and three}} destroyers shelled the Lunga {{perimeter}} for 20 minutes and illuminated the ridge with a searchlight. Japanese artillery began shelling the Marine lines, but did little damage. At the same time, scattered groups of Kawaguchi's troops began skirmishing with Marines around the ridge. Kawaguchi's 1st Battalion—led by Major Yukichi Kokusho—attacked the Raider's [...] "C" [...] company between the lagoon and the Lunga River, overrunning {{at least one}} platoon and forcing the Marine company to fall back to the ridge. Kokusho's unit became entangled with troops from Kawaguchi's 3rd Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Kusukichi Watanabe, who were still struggling to reach their attack positions, and the resulting confusion effectively stopped the Japanese attack on the ridge that night. Kawaguchi, who was having trouble locating where he was {{in relation to the}} U.S. Marine lines as well as coordinating his troops' attacks, later complained, [...] "Due to the devilish jungle, the brigade was scattered all over and was completely beyond my control. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>whole</b> <b>life</b> I have never felt so disappointed and helpless." [...] Twelve U.S. Marines were killed; Japanese casualties are unknown but perhaps somewhat greater. Although both Oka in the west and the Kuma unit in the east tried to attack the Marine lines that night, they failed to make contact and halted near the Marine lines at dawn.|$|E

2500|$|Barbara Alyn Woods portrays Deb Scott, Dan's {{wife and}} Nathan's mother. Initially normal, she later becomes neurotic. Woods said, [...] "She's fun to play, I love Deb Scott, she's a well-rounded character. I can't say I'm {{a lot like}} her, but I think our desires are the same. I {{think we want to}} be career women and good moms– I hope I'm a bit more {{successful}} than she is." [...] Explaining their differences, Woods added, [...] "I've never done any drugs <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>whole</b> <b>life,</b> I've never even smoked a cigarette– that's where I'd start– lay off the drugs. I'm not a big drinker, so I'd lay off the booze. So, {{that would be a good}} start for a mom I would say. And I've never cheated on my husband." [...] Seventeen years of marriage to Dan have made Deb bitter, and she divorces him in season 3, her hatred of him once driving her to try to kill him. Deb battles an addiction to pills in season 2 and again in season 4, but overcomes it permanently the second time.|$|E
