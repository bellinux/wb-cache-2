This study aimed to determine whether different treatment durations of single grade IV anteroposterior talocrural <b>joint</b> <b>mobilisations</b> elicit statistically significant differences in DF-ROM. Sixteen asymptomatic male football players (age = 27. 1 ± 5. 3 years) participated in the study. Non-weight bearing (NWB) and weight bearing (WB) DF-ROM was measured before and after 4 randomised treatment conditions: control treatment, 30 s, 1 min, 2 min. NWB DF-ROM was measured using a universal goniometer, and WB DF-ROM using the weight-bearing lunge test. A within-subjects design was employed so that all participants received each of the treatment conditions. A 4 × 4 balanced Latin square design and 1 week interval between sessions reduced any residual effects. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant improvement in DF-ROM following all AP mobilisation treatments (p < 0. 001). The within subjects contrasts showed that increases in treatment duration was associated with statistically significant improvements in DF-ROM (NWB DF-ROM control = 0. 01 %, 30 s = 14. 2 %, 1 min = 21. 6 %, 2 min = 32. 8 %; WB DF-ROM control = 0. 01 %, 30 s = 5. 0 %, 1 min = 7. 6 %, 2 min = 10. 9 %; p < 0. 05). However, WB DF-ROM improvements were below the minimal detectable change scores needed to conclude that improvements were not a consequence of measurement error.

40|$|Manual spinal <b>joint</b> <b>mobilisations</b> and {{manipulations}} {{are widely}} used treatments in patients with neck and low-back pain. Inter-examiner reliability of passive intervertebral motion assessment of the cervical and lumbar spine, perceived as important for indicating these interventions, is poor within a univariable approach. The diagnostic process as a whole in daily practice in manual therapy has a multivariable character, however, in which the use and interpretation of passive intervertebral motion assessment depend on earlier results from the diagnostic process. To date, the inter-examiner reliability among manual therapists of a multivariable diagnostic decision-making process in patients with neck or low-back pain is unknown. This study will be conducted as a repeated-measures design in which 14 pairs of manual therapists independently examine a consecutive series of a planned total of 165 patients with neck or low-back pain presenting in primary care physiotherapy. Primary outcome measure is therapists' decision {{about whether or not}} manual spinal <b>joint</b> <b>mobilisations</b> or manipulations, or both, are indicated in each patient, alone or as part of a multimodal treatment. Therapists will largely be free to conduct the full diagnostic process based on their formulated examination objectives. For each pair of therapists, 2 × 2 tables will be constructed and reliability for the dichotomous decision will be expressed using Cohen's kappa. In addition, observed agreement, prevalence of positive decisions, prevalence index, bias index, and specific agreement in positive and negative decisions will be calculated. Univariable logistic regression analysis of concordant decisions will be performed to explore which demographic, professional, or clinical factors contributed to reliability. This study will provide an estimate of the inter-examiner reliability among manual therapists of indicating spinal <b>joint</b> <b>mobilisations</b> or manipulations in patients with neck or low-back pain based on a multivariable diagnostic reasoning and decision-making process, as opposed to reliability of individual tests. As such, it is proposed as an initial step toward the development of an alternative approach to current classification systems and prediction rules for identifying those patients with spinal disorders that may show a better response to manual therapy which can be incorporated in randomised clinical trials.

40|$|Background Lateral epicondylalgia is a {{challenging}} condition to treat {{and in its}} chronic form is characterised by pain system changes. Cervical and Elbow mobilisations have been employed as interventions {{in the treatment of}} lateral epicondylalgia. Despite theories regarding the effects of mobilisations on the neurophysiology of pain, {{there is a lack of}} synthesised evidence and the hypotheses underlying mechanisms of action still need to be substantiated. Objectives The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the effects of cervical and elbow mobilisations on neurophysiology of pain in patients with lateral epicondylalgia and determine the level of evidence which exists. Methods Literature searching was conducted utilising electronic databases and entering defined keywords. Studies selected were required to fulfil pre-determined and specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. This process generated studies which were concerned with assessing the effects of either cervical or elbow <b>joint</b> <b>mobilisations</b> on neurophysiological outcome measures in patients with chronic lateral epicondylalgia. The reference lists of the selected studies were then checked to find other suitable papers. Data Extraction of relevant information from the studies was carried out. The selected studies underwent methodological quality assessment via the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale and the Effective Public Health Practice Project assessment tool. Results Six studies were included within this review. The total number of participants included across all studies was 129. Five of the studies were randomised, repeated-measures crossover trials and one study was a repeated-measures, before-and-after design. The resuts from all studies showed statistically significant sympathoexcitation occurred concurrent with analgesia and improvements in pressure pain threshold. Conclusions The results from all studies provide evidence to support the theory that <b>joint</b> <b>mobilisations</b> evoke analgesia via activation of descending pathways of nociceptive control.

This occurred despite the presence of an active bone pathology at the symptomatic cuboid (demonstrated with nuclear imaging), which could represent a stress reaction, transient osteoporosis, ischaemic necrosis, infection or neoplasm.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this case series is to present the {{clinical}} diagnosis of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) in three athletic patients, and to describe and discuss the outcomes of a multi-modal management approach provided by a chiropractor. Clinical Features: Three athletic patients, two male and one female aged from 31 to 42 years old (mean age, 35. 3 years), presented with hip and groin pain. A clinical diagnosis of FAI was made through synthesis of the patient history, physical examination and presence of morphological abnormalities on radiographic examination. Intervention and Outcome: Treatment addressed the entire "kinetic chain including the cervical and thoracic spine, lumbopelvic-hip complex, and lower extremity. Long-axis traction, high-velocity, low-amplitude (HVLA) mechanically assisted adjusting techniques (MAT) were applied to the involved hip, utilizing a chiropractic drop-piece table. Motion restriction of spinal, sacro-iliac and lower extremity articulations were treated with HVLA manipulation; <b>joint</b> <b>mobilisations</b> and/or MAT. Pre/post manipulative soft tissue techniques were applied to the involved hip, and corrective exercise therapy was prescribed. All three patients reported subjective improvements in hip pain and function.

Eighty-six participants (mean age 62 years, standard deviation (SD) 12. 7) with chronic cervicogenic dizziness were randomised to receive SNAGs with self-SNAGs (n= 29), PJMs with range-of-motion (ROM) exercises (n= 29), or a placebo (n= 28) for 2 - 6 sessions over 6 weeks. Outcome measures were dizziness intensity, dizziness frequency (rated between 0 [none] and 5 [>once/day]), the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), pain intensity, head repositioning accuracy (HRA), cervical spine ROM, balance, and global perceived effect (GPE). At 12 months both manual therapy groups had less dizziness frequency (mean difference SNAGs vs placebo- 0. 7, 95 % confidence interval (CI) - 1. 3,- 0. 2, p= 0. 01; PJMs vs placebo- 0. 7,- 1. 2,- 0. 1, p= 0. 02), lower DHI scores (mean difference SNAGs vs placebo- 8. 9, 95 % CI- 16. 3,- 1. 6, p= 0. 02; PJMs vs placebo- 13. 6,- 20. 8,- 6. 4, p< 0. 001) and higher GPE compared to placebo, whereas there were no between-group differences in dizziness intensity, pain intensity or HRA.

A power analysis calculation was performed and using a double blind, placebo-controlled, independent groups design, 36 healthy subjects (18 – 35 years) were randomly assigned to two groups (placebo intervention or treatment intervention). A BioPac unit recorded continuous SC measures before, during and after each experimental intervention. An exit questionnaire was used to validate the expectancy effects of the placebo intervention.

Manual therapy (MT), which comprises <b>joint</b> <b>mobilisations</b> and other hands-on techniques is commonly used by physiotherapists in Ireland as an adjunct to ET for hip OA but lacks evidence of efficacy. Therefore, this RCT (EMPART- Exercise and Manual Physiotherapy Arthritis Research Trial) was undertaken to primarily determine the clinical effectiveness of physiotherapy-based ET with and without MT for hip OA. A secondary aim was to ascertain the impact of an 8 -week waiting period for physiotherapy on outcomes. A total of 131 people with hip OA recruited from four hospitals were initially randomised to one of three groups: ET (n= 45), ETIMT (n= 43) and wait-list control (n= 43). Both intervention groups received treatment for 8 weeks, control group participants remained on the waiting list (8 weeks) and were subsequently randomised into the ET or ETIMT group.

40|$|<b>Joint</b> {{political}} <b>mobilisation</b> between {{trade unions}} and community groups, {{often referred to}} as ‘social movement unionism’, has been upheld as a way forward for organised labour in a neoliberal world economy. Analysing the interaction between unions and communities is critical for understanding the potential and actual roles played by trade unions in voicing the concerns of marginalized workers and poor communities. This article examines the efforts of organised municipal workers and urban social movements trying to unite their forces in post-apartheid South Africa, by looking at the politics of the Cape Town Anti-Privatisation Forum (APF). While the participants of the APF have in common their opposition to commercialisation and privatisation of service delivery, their political unity is fragile. By contrasting the ‘ideal-type’ social movement unionism depicted in the contemporary literature on labour and globalisation with the findings of this particular case, we uncover some main dimensions along which this organisational cooperation is challenged. In contrast to the political unity experienced during the anti-apartheid struggle, the APF initiative operates in a restructuring post-apartheid economy where bridging internal organisational differences and confronting the hegemonic position of the African National Congress (ANC) in civil society have proved particularly challenging...|$|R

Ankle dorsal flexion mobilisation: G 1 the measurement stability (post-intervention) ranged from 0. 543 and 0. 684 while G 2 ranged between 0. 899 and 0. 974. Conclusion KRTF was proven to be more effective tool than traditional teaching method in the teaching - learning process of two <b>joint</b> <b>mobilisation</b> techniques...|$|E
40|$|M. Dip. Tech. Functional {{leg length}} discrepancies, as {{distinct}} from anatomical discrepancies, are often associated with sacroiliac joint dysfunction. This may result in back pain and discomfort. Chiropractors usually treat this condition using a side posture sacroiliac adjustment, but in some cases, an adjustment may not be indicated. This study aims {{to determine whether a}} Modified General Hip technique would be an acceptable alternative treatment. For this study, 30 patients who suffered from both the sacroiliac joint dysfunction and leg length discrepancy were chosen. They were treated using two differing chiropractic techniques on the sacroiliac joint: the side posture technique conventionally used to adjust _the sacroiliac <b>joints,</b> and a <b>mobilisation</b> and muscle stretch technique modified from the General Hip technique. Each patient was evaluated by a case history, lumbar and pelvic regional examination, and a pertinent physical examination [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Sacro-iliac joint (S. I joint) {{dysfunction}} {{can result}} in leg length discrepancies (LLD). LLD {{has been associated with}} many musculoskeletal problems such as osteoarthritis of the hips, knee pain and lower back pain. It has been theorised that LLD alters a persons body posture, which in turn changes the forces acting on the joints in the lower extremity and spine. These unnatural forces then create the excessive forces seen as the causative factors in the previously mentioned musculoskeletal conditions. (Murrel, Cornwall, Doucet 1991) The purpose of this pilot study was to was to compare the effect of chiropractic manipulative therapy on the S. I <b>joints</b> with chiropractic <b>mobilisations</b> of the S. I joints on the weight transfer from the spine into the lower limbs. This randomised study consisted of two groups of fifteen patients between the ages of eighteen and fifty years. All potential candidates were examined and admitted once all the inclusion and exclusion criteria had been met. Once S. I joint restrictions were detected the patient received either chiropractic manipulation or mobilisation to the restricted joint. Group A received chiropractic manipulation while group B were treated with mobilisations of the S. I joints. Patients were treated over a two week treatment period. Objective measurements were taken before the 1 st treatment and after the 1 st, 3 rd, 5 th and final consultations one month later. The measurements were taken with the Spinal Analyses Machine (S. A. M). This instrument has got two scales on a platform that determines the patients weight distribution from the spine through the left and right lower limbs. The data collected was then statistically analysed using the One Way ANOVA Test (analyses of variance) as well as the Student-Newman-Keuls Method to compare the inter-group and intra-group data. Statistically significant changes in the weight distribution between the lower limbs were seen in group A. Based on the results from the study chiropractic manipulation to the S. I joint proved to be more effective than mobilisation in the treatment of S. I joint dysfunction. This does however require further research, and a larger sample size. Dr. M. Moodley Dr. J.

40|$|Abstract Background Chronic {{rotator cuff}} {{pathology}} (CRCP) {{is a common}} shoulder condition causing pain and disability. Physiotherapy is often {{the first line of}} management for CRCP yet there is little conclusive evidence to support or refute its effectiveness and no formal evaluation of its cost-effectiveness. Methods/Design This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will involve 200 participants with CRCP recruited from medical practices, outpatient departments and the community via print and radio media. Participants will be randomly allocated to a physiotherapy or placebo group using concealed allocation stratified by treating physiotherapist. Both groups will receive 10 sessions of individual standardised treatment over 10 weeks from one of 10 project physiotherapists. For the following 12 weeks, the physiotherapy group will continue a home exercise program and the placebo group will receive no treatment. The physiotherapy program will comprise shoulder <b>joint</b> and spinal <b>mobilisation,</b> soft tissue massage, postural taping, and home exercises for scapular control, posture and rotator cuff strengthening. The placebo group will receive inactive ultrasound and gentle application of an inert gel over the shoulder region. Blinded assessment will be conducted at baseline and at 10 weeks and 22 weeks after randomisation. The primary outcome measures are self reported questionnaires including the shoulder pain and disability index (SPADI), average pain on an 11 -point numeric rating scale and participant perceived global rating of change. Secondary measures include Medical Outcomes Study 36 -item short form (SF- 36), Assessment of Quality of Life index, numeric rating scales for shoulder pain and stiffness, participant perceived rating of change for pain, strength and stiffness, and manual muscle testing for shoulder strength using a handheld dynamometer. To evaluate cost-effectiveness, participants will record the use of all health-related treatments in a log-book returned to the assessor monthly. To test the effect of the intervention using an intention-to-treat analysis, linear regression modelling will be applied adjusting for baseline outcome values and other demographic characteristics. Participant measures of perceived change will be compared between groups by calculating the relative risks and their 95 % confidence intervals at each time point using log binomial regression. Discussion Results from this trial will contribute to the evidence regarding the effectiveness of a physiotherapy program for the management of CRCP.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} the impact of physiotherapy and exerClse frequency on primary dysmenorrhea {{in a group of}} nine women with primary dysmenorrhea. The incidence of joint dysfunctions and muscle trigger points in comparison with a control group was also examined. The women participated in individual and group physiotherapy and performed special exercises at home. Soft tissue and <b>joint</b> <b>mobilisation</b> techniques, dynamic neuromuscular stabilization according to Kolar and exercises according to Mojzisova were used. In most cases physiotherapy had positive effect on dysmenorrhea, especially in reducing low back pain during menstruation. There was higher incidence of trigger points and joint dysfunctions in the group with primary dysmenorrhea, in particular in the pelvic region. Women with higher exercise frequency experienced less severe dysmenorrhea. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{ligament}} injuries of the canine and feline {{stifle joint}} which result in luxation are uncommon. Two cats and one dog, that hod sustained such a joint injury were surgically treated. A rupture of the cranial and caudal cruciate ligaments, {{and at least}} one collateral ligament was observed in all of the three animals. Prosthetic reconstruction was used, as previously described, in combination with a novel technique of intraoperative placement of a temporary trans-articular pin (TTP) to maintain intra-operative anatomical reduction. TTP placement facilitated maintenance of joint alignment during surgical reconstruction and aided appropriate tensioning of the prosthetic sutures, preventing collapse of femorotibial joint compartments. The TTP was removed prior to closure of the joint allowing immediate post-operative <b>joint</b> <b>mobilisation.</b> Based on assessment by their owners, all the animals made a complete recovery. TTP was considered a relatively simple and effective adjunctive aid for surgical treatment of traumatic luxation of the stifle join...|$|E
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of entrapment neuropathies {{can be difficult}} because symptoms and signs often do not follow textbook descriptions and vary significantly between patients with the same diagnosis. Signs and symptoms which spread outside of the innervation territory of the affected nerve or nerve root are common. This Masterclass provides insight into relevant mechanisms that may account for this extraterritorial spread in patients with entrapment neuropathies, {{with an emphasis on}} neuroinflammation {{at the level of the}} dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord, as well as changes in subcortical and cortical regions. Furthermore, we describe how clinical tests and technical investigations may identify these mechanisms if interpreted in the context of gain or loss of function. The management of neuropathies also remains challenging. Common treatment strategies such as <b>joint</b> <b>mobilisation,</b> neurodynamic exercises, education, and medications are discussed in terms of their potential to influence certain mechanisms at the site of nerve injury or in the central nervous system. The mechanism-oriented approach for this Masterclass seems warranted given the limitations in the current evidence for the diagnosis and management of entrapment neuropathies. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Shoulder {{disorders}} {{are a common}} health problem in western societies. Several treatment protocols {{have been developed for}} the clinical management of persons with shoulder pain. However available evidence does not support any protocol as being superior over others. Systematic reviews provide some evidence that certain physical therapy interventions (i. e. supervised exercises and mobilisation) are effective in particular shoulder disorders (i. e. rotator cuff disorders, mixed shoulder disorders and adhesive capsulitis), but there is an ongoing need for high quality trials of physical therapy interventions. Usually, physical therapy consists of active exercises intended to strengthen the shoulder muscles as stabilizers of the glenohumeral <b>joint</b> or perform <b>mobilisations</b> to improve restricted mobility of the glenohumeral or adjacent joints (shoulder girdle). It is generally accepted that a-traumatic shoulder problems are the result of impingement of the subacromial structures, such as the bursa or rotator cuff tendons. Myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) in shoulder muscles may also lead to a complex of symptoms that are often seen in patients diagnosed with subacromial impingement or rotator cuff tendinopathy. Little is known about the treatment of MTrPs in patients with shoulder disorders. The primary aim {{of this study is to}} investigate whether physical therapy modalities to inactivate MTrPs can reduce symptoms and improve shoulder function in daily activities in a population of chronic a-traumatic shoulder patients when compared to a wait-and-see strategy. In addition we investigate the recurrence rate during a one-year-follow-up period. Methods/Design This paper presents the design for a randomized controlled trial to be conducted between September 2007 – September 2008, evaluating the effectiveness of a physical therapy treatment for non-traumatic shoulder complaints. One hundred subjects are included in this study. All subjects have unilateral shoulder pain for at least six months and are referred to a physical therapy practice specialized in musculoskeletal disorders of the neck-, shoulder-, and arm. After the initial assessment patients are randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a control-group (wait and see). The primary outcome measure is the overall score of the Dutch language version of the DASH (Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand) questionnaire. Discussion Since there is only little evidence for the efficacy of physical therapy interventions in certain shoulder disorders, there is a need for further research. We found only a few studies examining the efficacy of MTrP therapy for shoulder disorders. Therefore we will perform a randomised clinical trial of the effect of physical therapy interventions aimed to inactivate MTrPs, on pain and impairment in shoulder function in a population of chronic a-traumatic shoulder patients. We opted for an intervention strategy that best reflects daily practice. Manual high velocity thrust techniques and dry-needling are excluded. Because in most physical therapy interventions, blinding of the patient and the therapist is not possible, we will perform a randomised, controlled and observer-blinded study.

40|$|Hamstring strain (HS) is {{a common}} {{musculoskeletal}} condition and abnormal neurodynamics {{has been shown to}} influence HS and delay recovery. The efficacy of stretching for preventing and treating HS remains uncertain despite extensive research and wide-spread use. The effects of cervical spine mobilisation on peripheral nervous system function, neurodynamics and muscle force in the upper limb have been reported. Very few studies have reported effects of lumbar spine mobilisation on these variables in the lower limb. This study aimed to determine immediate effects of either a unilateral zygopophyseal joint posteroanterior mobilisation or a static posterior chain muscle stretch on the range of passive straight leg raise (SLR) in comparison to a non-treatment control. Using a single-blinded, randomised controlled study design, 36 healthy participants were allocated into one of three groups (control; mobilisation; static posterior chain muscle stretch). Measures of SLR were taken before and after intervention for each group on the day of testing. A General Linear Model (GLM) and a paired sample t-test showed a significant difference between base line and post-intervention for the mobilisation group only (p 3 ̆c 0. 001), and suggests that unilateral lumbar spine zygopophyseal <b>joint</b> <b>mobilisation</b> can immediately restore posterior chain neurodynamics...|$|E
40|$|Background and introduction: Neck pain is a {{frequent}} and disabling complaint in general population. One {{of the most common}} causes of neck pain is mechanical dysfunction of cervical spine. Although diverse methods have been proposed for increasing cervical range of motion, <b>joint</b> <b>mobilisation</b> has been confirmed as effective in several studies. The current study will compare the effect of three different treatment protocols i. e. Maitland mobilisation, Mulligan mobilisation and conventional treatment on upper thoracic spine on female patients with neck pain. This study tries to find out new effective method for reducing the problem of pain. Method: 30 subjects were selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly divided into three groups: Maitland, Mulligan mobilization along with conventional treatment. Pre and post reading at 0 day, 14 th day and 21 th day were recorded for NDI and NPRS scale. Results: After three week protocol it was found that all the three groups showed significant improvement in NDI and NPRS score within the group. The present finding shows that Group B (Maitland) shows significant improvements in the NDI score and Group C (Mulligan) would shows significant improvements in the NPRS scores in the patients with nonspecific neck pain. Conclusion: The present study shows that Maitland mobilisation along with the conventional treatment prov...|$|E
