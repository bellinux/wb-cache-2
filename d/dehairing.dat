40|$|Besides mixing, the {{dissolved}} barium distribution i the oceanic {{water column}} is controlled {{to a significant}} extent also by particle-solute interaction. In vitro uptake experiments involving diatom cultures suggest hat passive uptake prevails over active uptake. The overall effect of these processes i that barium behaves as a non-limiting nutrient element with ratios of dissolved over particulate concentrations varying between 100 and 1000. Uptake of barium by plankton particles eventually results {{in the formation of}} barium sulphate (baryte). There is increasing evidence that this baryte formation is closely linked with the formation of micro-environments composed of detrital organic matter, in which BaSO 4 saturation is eventually reached during the process of bacterial decay (Bishop, 1988; <b>Dehairs</b> et al., 1980). This mechanism sets the link between oceanic baryte and oceanic productivity and as a result oceanic baryte is now increasingly recognised to represent a good proxy for palaeoproductivity (Francois eta /., 1995). Using an extensive data set obtained mainly from the Southern Ocean we investigated the different main processes affecting the oceanic barium cycle. For particulate barium in surface waters regional variability can be important and this is clearly associated with variation of planktonic production and biomass uch as occurring, for instance, across the Polar Front Zone (PFZ). We observed that on a time scale of approximately three weeks water column stocks of micro-crystalline baryte co-vary with seasonal change in surface water productivity (<b>Dehairs</b> et al. 1997). This phase lag of about hree weeks is consistent with the time lapse required for baryte to be formed during in vitro experiments using decaying detritus from a diatom culture. This proces...|$|R

The bacterium Myxococcus xanthus was cultivated in a solid medium with a diluted solution of barium chloride. Crystallization occurred {{as a result of}} the presence of live bacteria and the bacterial metabolic activity. A phosphorous-rich amorphous phase preceded the more crystalline barite formation. These experiments may indicate the involvement of bacteria in the barium biogeochemical cycle, which is closely related to the carbon cycle. The mechanism by which barite precipitates in undersaturated seawater is one aspect of the Ba biogeochemical cycle that still remains unknown. Considerable research has focused on this element over the last 2 decades, since it is known to be a reliable indicator for variations in marine biological productivity (for examples, see references 3, 6, 9, 11, 16, and 17).

The teacher orders Lili to remove the dog from the class, and Lili removes him but defiantly she leaves too. Lili's father then abandons Hagen {{on the side of the}} road. Hagen chases their car but is unable to catch them. Hagen then is captured by a man who sells him to a dog fighter. He is treated cruelly and trained to kill. In his first fight, he kills his opponent and escapes. He is caught by animal control officers and brought to the city dog pound. Meanwhile, Lili goes to a party where she drinks alcohol and is caught by the police in possession of drugs. Her father picks her up at the police station, where he cries, she realizes that he loves her, they reconcile, and she rejoins her music class to prepare for a concert. Meanwhile, Hagen escapes from the pound after killing one of the staff. 250 other dogs follow him out of the pound into the city and start an organised uprising against their human oppressors. The dogs wreak mayhem in the city and Hagen attacks and kills several people who harmed him. The pack interrupts the concert where Lili is playing, and Lili realizes that Hagen is one of the pack.

The present study investigated theproduction, optimization andapplications of an extracellular alkalineprotease (AkP) fromthe edible mushroom Termitomyces clypeatus focusing on bioremediation. RESULTS: For optimized enzyme production, the variables significantly influencing the protease activitywere screened through the 11 factorial Plackett–Burman design. The optimum values of the selected variables and their mutual interactions were determined through response surfacemethodology using the Box–Behnken experimental design. Overall a 10 -fold increase in enzyme activity (1830 UmL- 1) was obtained which closely matched the yield predicted by the statisticalmodel (1778. 63 UmL- 1) with R 2 = 0. 9819. AkP could efficiently <b>dehair</b> the goat skin, detached bird feather vanes from its shaft and reduce BOD, COD and pH of tannery waste effluent. The AkP also demonstrated bactericidal property against Staphylococcus aureus as detected by MIC and flow cytometry analyses. CONCLUSION: As an ecofriendly alternative, the enzyme showed significant promise for bioremediation and industrial applications through time-saving bioprocesses.

40|$|Spring {{and summer}} {{profiles}} of dissolved and particulate barium (Ba) from WOCE SR 3 line (145 °E) in the Southern Ocean are compared and seasonal evolutions discussed. Fluxes are estimated from mass conservation equations and from differences in reservoir contents between seasons. Subtraction of barium is observed at mesopelagic depths (upper 600  m) {{and appears to}} exceed up to tenfold the combined local build-up and the deep-ocean fluxes of particulate Ba, pointing towards significant dissolution {{to take place in}} intermediate and deep waters. Although regression analyses identify silicate as the major predictor of dissolved Ba, Ba and silicate are clearly uncoupled in surface waters where Ba behaves more similar to nitrate, excluding diatoms as users of Ba. Moreover, we observe a southward decrease in the Ba vs. silicate regression slopes driven by the conditions in intermediate and deep waters and mainly marked by the location of the Polar Front. These findings corroborate existing knowledge about the predominant control by barite formation and dissolution on the oceanic Ba cycle. It suggests a decreased dissolution of barite south of the Polar Front as compared to the situation in the Polar Front Zone and the Subantarctic Zone. This is in agreement with the fact that, except for deep waters, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current water column is oversaturated with respect to barite, in contrast to the situation north of the Polar Front, where the whole water column is undersaturated [Jeandel C.

Rivers do not merely transport carbon from the terrestrial to the oceanic environment, but also bury and process organic matter, typically acting as a source of CO 2 to the atmosphere. However, there are few studies which quantify carbon fluxes in tropical rivers, and data for the African continent are particularly scarce. In this study, we report the altitudinal patterns in organic carbon pools and their stable isotopic compositions in the Tana River Basin (Kenya). Samples for dissolved and particulate organic carbon, as well as soil and sediment organic carbon were collected in February 2008 (end of dry season), September-November 2009 (short rains), and June-July 2010 (end of long rains) sampling campaigns throughout the 120, 000 km² Tana river basin. Furthermore, monthly data are collected at 5 sites since January 2009. A consistent downstream increase in TSM was observed during all three sampling campaigns. A consistent downstream decrease in %C and %N was observed for soil and sediment samples during all the three campaigns (p 0. 05). Both δ 13 C soil and sediment did not exhibit clear altitudinal trends. The DOC concentration were highest during the wet season (2009) and consistently increased downstream. δ 13 C-DOC values were similar during the three campaigns and ranged overall between - 27. 7 and - 20. 9 ‰. δ 13 C-POC increased downstream (p< 0. 01), and were predominantly of terrestrial origin as reflected by generally high POC/Chl a ratios. TSM and %POC followed a typical inverse relationship, which substantially deviated from those used in the NEWS 2 model towards the highest TSM concentration. TSM and POC delivery was highly episodic during wet season (2009 sampling campaign), and mostly mobilized at intermediate altitudes dominated by intensive agriculture. δ 13 C-POC values reflects an increasing contribution of C 4 -derived carbon downstream. status: publishe...|$|R

We are grateful to Evaline van Weerlee (NIOZ, Texel) for the silicate measurements on board Polarstern and Rob Middag (NIOZ) for help with sampling for barium. We thank the captain and crew of Polarstern for their hospitality and help. This work was partly funded by the EU IP CARBOOCEAN (project nr. 511176, GOCE). 3 ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV AMSTERDAM MAR CHEMThe Southern Ocean data base of dissolved barium (Bad) has been augmented with two densely sampled sections across the Weddell Gyre sampled by the icebreaker FS Polarstern during February and March 2005. Bad was found to be relatively high in the surface layer as compared to the adjacent waters north (Antarctic Circumpolar Current) and east (Antarctic Zone of the Indian sector). Compared to the inflowing water into the Weddell Gyre and also to the surface water, the deep water is characterized by a significant Ba-d enrichment. Depletion of Bad in the surface layer is associated with well-known biogeochemical processes, but we speculate that also sea-ice formation leads to the extraction of Ba from solution via barite (BaSO 4) precipitation. The particulate Ba settles down the water column and redissolves in deeper water where undersaturation of barite is prevalent. In the bottom layer, enrichment of Ba-d occurs, exhibited as a Ba-d maximum, which is caused by Ba efflux from the sediments. In recently formed Weddell Sea Bottom Water, though, a Ba-d minimum is observed, imposed by the shelf water component of bottom water, which has relatively low Ba-d concentration. Like in other Southern Ocean regions, throughout the water column a strong correlation exists between Ba-d and dissolved silicate, although the relationship is different from that in the Antarctic regions to the east. In a tentative budget, the deep water is found to be supplied with Ba-d mainly by the surface layer, but also to some extent by the bottom layer. Weddell Sea Deep Water, enriched in Ba-d, is transferred out of the Weddell Gyre into the ACC as Antarctic Bottom Water, making the gyre a source of Ba-d to the deep and abyssal world oceans.

40|$|International audienceBarite is {{commonly}} found in suspended matter in ocean waters and in marine sediments. The calculation of the barite saturation index of the world's ocean waters {{has shown that the}} vast majority of the oceans are undersaturated with respect to pure barium sulfate, equilibrium being reached at a few locations like the Southern Ocean surface waters, deep waters of the Bay of Bengal or intermediate waters of the Pacific [Monnin, C., Jeandel, C., Cattaldo, T., <b>Dehairs,</b> F., 1999. The marine barite saturation state of the world's oceans. Mar. Chem. 65 (3 - 4), 253 261. ]. It is thus paradoxical to commonly find barite in a globally undersaturated ocean. Strontium is the most common impurity in natural barite. It is often suggested that the Ba content of ocean waters is controlled by equilibrium with Sr-substituted barite, and not with pure BaSO 4. In order to address this problem, we have used the GEOSECS data (49 stations, 1404 data points) to calculate the saturation index of substituted barite in the world's ocean using Lippmann's description of thermodynamic equilibrium between a solid solution and an aqueous solution for the (Ba,Sr) SO 4 system. Recent studies indicate that the (Ba,Sr) SO 4 solid solution is most likely regular and continuous. The calculated saturation indices of the regular solid solution (with the interaction parameter A 0 equal to 1. 6) are closer to those of pure barite than those calculated for the ideal solid solution. Conclusions previously reached for the pure barite case are not changed: the saturation state of ocean waters with respect to a regular solid solution is very close to that of pure barite. Sr-substitution for Ba in barium sulfate does not bring barite at equilibrium. When equilibrium is reached, the degree of Sr substitution of Ba amounts to only a few mole percent of Sr. Equilibrium values of the Sr content of the solid solutions in the intermediate (0. 2 0. 8) range are found for ocean surface waters where the Ba/Sr ratio is low, but as these waters are undersaturated, such solids are not stable in the water column. This provides another reason for the bimodal distribution of (Ba,Sr) SO 4 solid solutions in nature, on top of that induced by the large ratio of the end member solubility products. Equilibrium is found for cold waters (i. e. for temperatures below 5 °C) having a Ba content greater than about 70 nmol/kg. The distribution coefficient of Sr in barite can be calculated from the Ba and Sr concentrations of these samples and from the equilibrium Sr mole fraction of the solid solution obtained from Lippmann's diagram. It was found independent of pressure and it varies only slightly with the temperature of the sample. For the regular solid solution (with A 0 = 1. 6), it is: 10 DBaSOBa(regular) = 10 mmxx= 0. 227 t+ 3. 753. This expression (which has been established for temperatures below 5 °C) can be used to directly calculate the composition of solid solutions at equilibrium with a given seawater sample, or conversely to know the Ba content of seawater at equilibrium with a given (Ba,Sr) SO 4 solid solution...|$|R
40|$|The spatial {{distributions}} of most dissolved and particulate trace metals are, at least qualitatively, similar. Their concentrations decrease with {{distance from the}} coast and {{the mouth of the}} Scheldt estuary (particulates much stronger than dissolved species). The salinity gradient is similar (but opposite) to the trace metals and turbidity gradients. The five trace metals studied can be subdivided into two groups {{on the basis of their}} KD's (ratio of particulate metal concentration to dissolved metal concentration). Hg and Pb are strongly associated with particulate matter (KD from 0. 5 to 1. 5 offshore and from 7. 9 to 40 in the coastal area), while Cd, Cu and Zn are predominantly in the dissolved phase (KD from 0. 1 to 0. 2 offshore - up to 0. 5 for Zn - and from 1 to 1. 7 in the coastal area). Offshore fluxes of dissolved Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb and Zn are calculated based on diffusive and mixing processes. They can explain the concentration increases in the coastal flow tube (315 km 3. y- 1), but are insignificant beyond that flow tube. The ratios of the Scheldt output to the offshore flux vary from 38 to 85 %, depending on the kind of metal. The ratios of the Scheldt output to the metal flow parallel to the coast is smaller than 1 %. The steady-state concentration profiles of particulate metals versus salinity are fairly constant in the coastal-estuarine and marine water masses, but decrease very abruptly from the first to the second water mass. Assuming a conservative behaviour of the particulate metals, offshore fluxes and the resulting concentration increases in the coastal flow tube, were deduced. These calculated concentration increases agree fairly well with the observed values. The contribution of the Scheldt estuary to the flows parallel to the coast ranges from 1. 6 to 3. 3 %. Biological productivity in coastal waters is often very high owing to the high levels of nutrients supplied via coastal inputs or through upwelling. In Belgian coastal waters for example the daily primary production ranges from 10 to 280 mg N. m - 2 day - 1 corresponding to an annual primary production of about 25 g N. m - 2 y - 1 (Baeyens et al. 1983, Mommaerts et al. 1984, Baeyens et al. 1984). Shellfish and fish thus find there excellent spawning, nursing and feeding grounds. Coastal ecosystems are very sensitive to pollution, which can perturb severely the biological processes. Heavy metals are amongst the major potential pollutants because of their toxicity. Obtaining reliable, accurate trace metal data in, seawater is still a cumbersome operation. In order to evaluate our analyzing procedures, we participated at several intercalibration exercises: (1) the intercalibration exercises for the analysis of cadmium and mercury in sea water requested by the Joint Monitoring Group of the Oslo and Paris Commissions and conducted by ICES. The results have been reported by Thibaud (1981) for cadmium and 01 afsson (1981) for mercury; (2) the intercalibration exercise of trace metals in sediments conducted by the "Centre Oceanologique de Bretagne, CNEXO". The results have been reported by Joanny et al (1980); (3) for the analysis of mercury in botanical substrates (BCR reference materials), we compared several mineralization-digestion methods. Results have been reported by <b>Dehairs</b> et al. (1982). Participation at these intercalibration exercises offered us the possibility to demonstrate that the analyzing procedures in use in our laboratories for Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb and Zn produce reliable data, at least on samples similar to those that served for the intercalibration exercises. Another encouraging fact is that our trace metal data obtained in the English Channel (Baeyens et al., 1987), the Southern Bight of the North Sea (see Table 1), the northern North Sea (Baeyens et al., 1987) and the Mediterranean Sea (our data are given in the section “Sampling of heavy metals”, this paper; for example Mart et al., 1982 report data for the Western Mediterranean Sea) compare favourably with these obtained by other investigators in the same areas.

30|$|The leather {{processing}} industry contributes {{significantly to the}} country’s economic development. Waste from the leather industry leads to environmental pollution. Alkaline proteases have <b>dehairing</b> properties {{and can be used}} in the leather {{processing industry}}. Conventional methods in leather processing involve the use of hydrogen sulphide and other chemicals which are pollutants. Thus, for environmental reasons, the enzymatic <b>dehairing</b> process has more advantages over the chemical <b>dehairing</b> process (Andersen 1998). Proteases are used during the soaking, <b>dehairing</b> and bating states of preparing skins and hides. Pancreatic proteases are used in the bating process and the use of microbial alkaline proteases are popular (Varela et al. 1997). Alkaline proteases swell hair roots and attack hair follicle proteins, resulting in the easy removal of hair. These enzymes have been widely studied and their production from Bacillus sp. has gained momentum; moreover, the high activity and stability of these enzymes at various temperature and pH ranges have also attracted the attention of researchers. <b>Dehairing</b> proteases have been characterized from various Bacillus sp., e.g. B. subtilis 11 QDB 32 (Varela et al. 1997), B. amyloliquefaciens (George et al. 1995), B. subtilis K 2 (Hameed et al. 1996; Hameed et al. 1999) and B. circulans (Subba Rao et al. 2009).|$|E

After screening on skim milk agar plates, a total of nine positive mutants were selected for shake flask experiments. Among these, the best proteolytic mutant designated as UV- 9 showed 1. 4 fold higher alkaline protease activity in preoptimized growth medium than the parent strain. The fermentation profile and kinetic parameters such u(h- 1), Yp/s, Yp/x, Yx/s, q s, Qs, q p and Qp also indicated the superiority of the selected mutant UV- 9 for alkaline protease production over the parent strain and rest of the mutants. The <b>dehairing</b> capability of mutant UV- 9 alkaline protease was analyzed by soaking goat skin pieces for different time intervals (3 - 15 h) at 40 º C.

40|$|<b>Dehairing</b> {{is one of}} {{the highly}} polluting {{operations}} in the leather industry. The conventional lime-sulfide process used for <b>dehairing</b> produces large amounts of sulfide, which poses serious toxicity and disposal problems. This operation also involves hair destruction, a process that leads to increased chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), and total suspended solid (TSS) loads in the effluent. With these concerns in mind, enzyme-assisted <b>dehairing</b> has often been proposed as an alternative method. The main enzyme preparations so far used involved keratinases. The present paper reports on the purification of an extracellular keratinase (KERUS) newly isolated from Brevibacillus brevis strain US 575. Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) analysis revealed that the purified enzyme was a monomer with a molecular mass of 29121. 11 Da. The sequence of the 27 N-terminal residues of KERUS showed high homology with those of Bacillus keratinases. Optimal activity was achieved at pH 8 and 40 °C. Its thermoactivity and thermostability were upgraded in the presence of 5 mM Ca(2 +). The enzyme was completely inhibited by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and diiodopropyl fluorophosphates (DFP), which suggests that it belongs to the serine protease family. KERUS displayed higher levels of hydrolysis, substrate specificity, and catalytic efficiency than NUE 12 MG and KOROPON® MK EG keratinases. The enzyme also exhibited powerful keratinolytic activity that made it able to accomplish the entire feather-biodegradation process on its own. The kerUS gene encoding KERUS was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The biochemical properties of the extracellular purified recombinant enzyme (rKERUS) were similar to those of native KERUS. Overall, the findings provide strong support for the potential candidacy of this enzyme as an effective and eco-friendly alternative to the conventional chemicals used for the <b>dehairing</b> of rabbit, goat, sheep and bovine hides in the leather processing industry...|$|E

Samples from 240 control (conventionally processed) and 240 treated (chemically dehaired before hide removal) hides (immediately after stunning but before treatment) and preevisceration carcasses (immediately after hide removal) were obtained from four visits to a commercial beef processing plant. Total aerobic plate counts (APC) and Enterobacteriaceae counts (EBC) were not (P. 0. 05) different between cattle designated for chemical <b>dehairing</b> (8. 1 and 5. 9 log CFU/ 100 cm 2 for APC and EBC, respectively) and cattle designated for conventional processing (8. 0 and 5. 7 log CFU/ 100 cm 2 for APC and EBC, respectively). However, E. coli O 157 :H 7 hide prevalence was higher (P, 0. 05) for the control group than for the treated group (67 % versus 88 %). In contrast to hides, the bacterial levels were lower (P, 0. 05) on the treated (3. 5 and 1. 4 log CFU/ 100 cm 2 for APC and EBC) than the control (5. 5 and 3. 2 log CFU/ 100 cm 2 for APC and EBC) preevisceration carcasses. Prevalence of E. coli O 157 :H 7 was lower (P. 0. 05) on treated than on control preevisceration carcasses (1 % versus 50 %). These data indicate that chemical <b>dehairing</b> of cattle hides is an effective intervention to reduce the incidence of hide-to-carcass contamination with pathogens. The data als...|$|E
40|$|A {{bacterium}} {{was isolated}} from dog dung. Preliminary {{characterization of the}} organism according to Burgey’s manual suggests that the organism may belong to Bacillus species. It has been provisionally named as Bacillus FS- 1. It has grown at high temperature and pH. It secretes an exoprotease in the growth medium. It forms spores during adverse condition in the growth medium. The enzyme seems to be alkaline metallo protease and is capable of <b>dehairing</b> of skin and hides. The enzyme has commercial importance...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{investigations}} was to improve the yield of alkaline protease for leather <b>dehairing</b> by subjecting the indigenous proteolytic strain Bacillus licheniformis N- 2 to various mutagenic treatments viz. UV irradiations, NTG (N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguinidine) and MMS (methyl methane sulfonate). After screening on skim milk agar plates, a total of nine positive mutants were selected for shake flask experiments. Among these, the best proteolytic mutant designated as UV- 9 showed 1. 4 fold higher alkaline protease activity in preoptimized growt...|$|E
30|$|Nevertheless, other {{applications}} of keratinases should be denoted as exceptionally promising in industrial circumstances. One {{of the target}} areas is leather industry, where keratinases support or carry out the <b>dehairing</b> process, allowing to at least partially replace lime-sulfide treatment. Also, application of keratin hydrolysates allowed for the reduction of chromium effluents from the process of tanning (Balaji et al. 2008). Another vital area is the introduction of keratinolytic microorganisms the initial biodegradation stage, preceding the bioconversion keratin hydrolysates into biogas (Patinvoh et al. 2016).|$|E
