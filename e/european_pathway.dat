40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} whether clinical/care pathway audit tools {{can identify the}} characteristics of well-organized care processes. BACKGROUND: Although pathways are used worldwide, confusion exists about the concept and impact. Evaluation Search of OVID-Medline, Cinahl, British Nursing Index; manual search of the Journal of Integrated Care Pathways; contact with Smartgroup on Clinical Pathways and board members of the <b>European</b> <b>Pathway</b> Association and Google search. KEY ISSUES: We selected seven of 15 clinical pathway audit tools for this review. Through content analysis, we identified 17 characteristics and grouped them using the realistic evaluation paradigm. The Integrated Care Pathway Appraisal Tool is the most appropriate audit tool to assess clinical pathway documents. CONCLUSIONS: It is astonishing that so little research on clinical pathway audit tools has been underwent, given the prevalent use of clinical pathways. Because the concept of clinical pathways remains unclear, a variety of audit tools are needed to help clarify the concept. Further research on the construct and criterion validity of pathway audit tools is necessary to fully understand why and under which circumstances pathways lead to improved care. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Care pathways, {{also known}} as {{clinical}} pathways, are used worldwide to organize and follow-up patient focused care processes. Care pathways are nowadays defined as complex interventions. In the past years, more than 110 organizations in Belgium and The Netherlands performed more than 1200 pathway projects. These projects used the 30 step methodology of the Belgian Dutch Clinical Pathway Network, developed by the Center for Health Services and Nursing Research, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven between 1998 and 2002. 	Based on the experience in the Network between 2002 and 2009 and based on national and international research in close collaboration with the <b>European</b> <b>Pathway</b> Association, the methodology was revised. The 30 step methodology was changed into a seven phase model to develop, implement, evaluate and continuously follow-up care pathways and is usable for in-hospital, primary care and cross boundary projects. The seven phases consist of a screening phase, a project management phase, a diagnose phase, a development phase, an implementation phase, an evaluation phase and a continuous follow-up phase.

40|$|Integrated care pathways, {{clinical}} pathways, patient journeys {{and care}} maps are interchangeable terminology to describe tools which promote organised and efficient patient care {{based on the}} best available evidence and guidelines (Kwan et al., 2004). A care pathway can further {{be described as a}} ‘complex intervention for the mutual decision making and organisation of care processes for a well-defined group of patients during a well-defined period’ (<b>European</b> <b>Pathway</b> Association, 2007). The use of care pathways allows continuous assessment of clinical processes and outcomes against current best practice and guidelines. As evidence-based practice become progressively more important for effective health delivery, increased research use within aphasia rehabilitation is paramount. Currently, stroke clinical guidelines offer very little in the form of aphasia-specific recommendations to inform practice. Our systematic review of clinical practice guidelines revealed a paucity of high-quality aphasia rehabilitation guidelines internationally (Rohde et al, in press). Integrated care pathways are gaining increasing popularity in health care delivery and offer a potential solution to the lack of evidence-based recommendations within aphasia rehabilitation. The AARP aims to improve the overall patient journey for people with aphasia through providing clinicians with access to the best evidence in a dynamic and user-friendly format. In addition to the principles of integrated care pathways, the AARP utilises the theory of evidence-based practice through combining the best available evidence with family/client perspectives and clinical expertise. The AARP is also underpinned by the principles of knowledge transfer and exchange (KTE) which aims to close the research-practice gap in order to realise and maximise the benefits of research within the practice setting. Hence the aims of this paper are to: a) Present results of the systematic review of clinical guidelines in stroke and aphasia b) Describe the consensus document that maps the AARP. c) Describe the translation of a highly complex system to a user-friendly web-based system...|$|E
40|$|Rationale Care Pathways (CP) and Lean Management (LM) are two {{approaches}} for streamlining care processes that have {{their roots in}} industry. CP derived from the critical path method. The <b>European</b> <b>Pathway</b> Association defines a CP as a complex intervention for the mutual decision-making and organisation of care for a well-defined group of patients during a well-defined period of time. LM is an operations management strategy that was originally developed in Japan by the Toyota Motor Corporation in the 1940 s. To reduce costs and lead times, Toyota focused on eliminating waste that prevented the value-added flow of products {{through a series of}} operations. CP and LM concepts might be complementary in organising care. CP defines key elements of care and coordinates team roles. LM encloses techniques to optimise resource scheduling of activities in the CP. Effects of applying a CP together with LM have not been reported yet. It would be of interest to investigate how CP and LM intervene in the organisation of care and how these two concepts relate to each other. Objective and research questionsThe aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the impact of care pathways and lean management on the organisation of ophthalmic care. Three research questions were formulated: 1. What is the relationship between care pathways and lean management? 2. What are effects of applying care pathways and lean management on adherence, patient outcomes and efficiency? 3. What are experiences of care teams with applying care pathways and lean management? Study settingThe study was conducted in the Rotterdam Eye Hospital (REH), located in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Study design and patient groupsThis research consists of a systematic literature review, two controlled-before after studies, i. e., the strabismus and cataract study, and a mixed methods study, i. e., the team study. The intervention is applying a care pathway with lean management techniques to the organisation of ophthalmic care, further referred to as lean care pathway (LCP). Based upon the findings of the literature, we defined the lean care pathway intervention as a multidisciplinary process improvement approach to streamline the care process, based upon evidence-based guidelines, and the supporting business processes for a well-defined group of patients during a well-defined period of time. The LCP was developed and implemented according toa protocol that followed the structure of the Seven Phases Model© of the Belgium-Dutch Care Pathways Network. The researcher fulfilled the role of pathway facilitator. Systematic literature reviewTo acquire knowledge on the content of CP and LM concepts, a systematic review of the literature related to applying CP or LM to hospital care was carried out. Articles were identified through electronic databases Medline, Embase and Business Source Premier limited from January 2007 to May 2010. After categorising the content of the papers, we included 28 CP studies and 20 LM studies. We scored the objectives and outcome measures reported in each CP and LM study and categorised these in the five domains of the Leuven Clinical Pathway Compass: process, clinical, service, financial and team. We used a service operations management framework to classify and reflect on the impact of CP and LM on the organisation of care. The framework aligned the service concept and service delivery system with the objectives and target patient groups. Strabismus study The strabismus study investigated effects of implementing an LCP for strabismus surgery on adherence, patient outcomes and efficiency. The LCP was developed between January and October 2007 and implemented in November 2007. Objective was decreasing waiting time for surgery, while maintaining a high quality of care. A service concept was defined and four interventions were implemented, i. e., 1) takt times to synchronise resources in the LCP; 2) pull planning to integrally schedule all activities in the LCP; 3) one-stop preoperative visit; and 4) checklists for patient education. To analyse effects on procedural adherence and efficiency outcomes, we selected all 522 patients that underwent strabismus surgery between 1 January and 30 September 2007 in the pretest group and all 460 patients that underwent strabismus surgery between 1 January and 30 September 2008 in the posttest group. To analyse effects on clinical adherence and patient outcomes, we included a random pretest sample of 125 patients and a random posttest sample of 126 patients. All 251 patients filled in a Consumer Quality Index (CQI) questionnaire three months after surgery to measure their experiences with the quality of care. The pretest control group enclosed all 664 patients with retinal detachment that underwent acute vitreoretinal surgery between 1 January and 30 September 2007. The posttest control group enclosed all 510 patients with retinal detachment that underwent acute vitreoretinal surgery between 1 January and 30 September 2008. All patients in the control group received the same care. Cataract studyThe cataract study investigated effects of implementing an LCP for cataract surgery on adherence, patient outcomes and efficiency. The LCP was developed between February and December 2008 and implemented in January 2009. Objectives were to narrowthe gap between realised and expected performance and to increase value for patients in terms of fewer hospital visits and better experiences with the quality of care. A service concept was defined and four interventions were implemented, i. e., 1) a new admission form to eliminate all duplicated and ambiguous information; 2) a cataract care centre to group activities on one location; 3) surgery under topical anaesthesia to reduce costs; and 4) tailored patient brochures. We included a random pretest sample of 181 patients that underwent first-eye cataract surgery between 1 March and 30 June 2007 and a random posttest sample of 181 patients that underwent first-eye cataract surgery between 1 March and 30 June 2009. All 362 patients filled in a Consumer Quality Index (CQI) questionnaire two months after surgery to measure their experiences with the quality of care. The pretest control group enclosed all 283 patients with retinal detachment that underwent acute vitreoretinal surgery between 1 March and 30 June 2007. The posttest control group enclosed all 268 patients with retinal detachment that underwent acute vitreoretinal surgery between 1 March and 30 June 2009. All patients in the control group received the same care. Team studyThe quantitative part of the team study consisted of annual measurements of the Care Process Self Evaluation Tool (CPSET) and the Workforce Development (WD) Survey to investigate the teams experiences with the organisation of care and the impact of the LCP on team engagement respectively. For the CPSET, we selected random samples from the strabismus team and the cataract team. In 2007, 28 strabismus team members and 22 cataract team members filled-in the CPSET; in 2008, 26 and 20 members respectively; and in 2009, 27 and 28 members respectively. For the WD Survey, we selected random samples from the business units that were involved in the implementation of an LCP, i. e., three clinical divisions, the ward and operating theatre, and the back office. In 2007, 68 team members filled-in a WD Survey; in 2008, 46 members; and in 2009, 66 members. In the qualitative part of the study, in 2009, an independent researcher conducted semi-structured interviews to explore the experiences of 14 members of the strabismus and/or cataract care team with implementing an LCP. Convenience sampling was used to select interviewees. Main outcome measuresIn the strabismus, cataract and team study main outcome measures were also defined in the five domains of the Leuven Clinical Pathway Compass, i. e., in the process domain clinical and procedural adherence (data source: hospital database and patient record analysis); in the clinical domain clinical outcome measures (data source: patient record analysis) and patient-reported outcome measures (data source: CQI questionnaire); in the service domain patient experiences with the quality of care (data source: CQI questionnaire); in the financial domain lead times, number of hospital visits, direct costs andgaps between realised and expected performance (data source: hospital database); and in the team domain the teams experiences with the organisation of care (data source: CPSET), team engagement (data source: WD Survey), team functioning (data source: interviews) and the teams experiences with implementing an LCP (data source: interviews). Results Relationship between care pathways and lean managementCP was frequently applied to improve appropriateness and timeliness of executing key elements of care, based upon evidence-based guidelines, and LM to improve efficiency and throughput times. In contrast with LM, CP regularly monitored if the clinical quality of care was maintained. Most CP and LM concepts standardised the sequence and timing of process steps, specified the roles of the care team and were implemented by a multidisciplinary team. Initiators of care pathways usually had a clinical background and initiators of lean management more often had a managerial background. Both CP and LM concepts seldom applied techniques to improve resource scheduling, tracing performance, team functioning or patient involvement. LM studies primarily applied easy-to-copy techniques, such as value stream mapping and 5 -Why root cause analysis. The literature review shows that CP and LM concepts can be used complementary to each other in organising the care process and the supporting business processes. Effects of care pathways and lean management on adherence, patient outcomes and efficiencyThe LCP for strabismus surgery significantly improved adherence and efficiency outcomes, while patient outcomes remained at the same level. Waiting time for surgery decreased with 38 %. Patients reported good experiences with the quality of care. The LCP for cataract surgery also significantly improved adherence and efficiency outcomes, while patient outcomes remained stable. Mainly the increased use of co-managed care (i. e., first-day telephone review by a nurse and final review by an optometrist) in combination with a decreased frequency of ophthalmic screening appointments increased clinical productivity with 18 %. Patients in the LCP graded the overall care delivered by the hospital and by the nurse significantly higher and reported significantly more often that they received postoperative instructions. The care teams experiences with care pathways and lean management Having an LCP implemented significantly improved the care professionals perception of the overall organisation of care. Team members perceived that implementing an LCP increased the patient focus of the organisation and their chances to develop and grow as a team. The teams experiences were influenced by experienced benefits, the impact on work and by participating in the implementation process of the LCP. The organisation structure and mutual interdependency between team members determined to what extent the pathway team evolved into a more structural multidisciplinary team. Discussion and conclusionThis study shows that applying a CP with LM techniques in the organisation of two surgical ophthalmic procedures significantly increased efficiency outcomes while maintaining a high quality of care. Improved performance in the process domain was associated with a more cost-effective use of resources in the pathway. In this study, letting the multidisciplinary team conduct a current state analysis and construct a service concept was an important facilitator to change. The current state analysis revealed hidden assumptions and process knowledge gaps. Defining the CP explicated the service concept that was present in the minds of the care professionals. This service concept stated all conditions on which the care process could be designed and created confidence that the clinical quality was guaranteed. Barriers to change arose as soon as the intervention affected the care professionals activities. When pathway teams aim to eliminate or reallocate clinical activities, they should be able to quantitatively motivate their reasons. Spending enough time on identifying the root causes that prevented implementing the new pathway design enabled the pathway teams to overcome most problems. This study shows that CP and LM are used as projects. To facilitate follow-up and innovation, a structure with communication lines, integrated task forces and a performance system should be implemented as part of the project. Framing the CP and LM concepts in a service operations management context facilitated analysis and comparison of the CP and LM concepts and provided insight on the interventions impact on the hospital service delivery system. We recommend that reporting complex interventions such as applying CP and LM concepts should be done in a more structured and standardised style. The service operations management checklist developed in this study can be used for such purposes. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{fertility}} transition, {{one of the two}} essential components of the demographic transition. The analysis demonstrates that by applying the cohort perspective new insights are obtained about how the fertility transition unfolded. Within the overall framework of the fertility transition there were four distinct pathways of fertility trends. Combining these findings with those of other scholars shows that the demographic transition has not yet led to an equilibrium of relatively stable low mortality and stable low fertility. The four fertility transition pathways are the following: (1) The Western fertility transition pathway characterized by major cohort total fertility rate (CTFR) fluctuations; (2) the South <b>European</b> fertility transition <b>pathway</b> characterized by an almost uninterrupted CTFR decline; (3) the Central and East <b>European</b> fertility transition <b>pathway</b> characterized by stable CTFRs in the 1920 s to 1950 s cohorts and a decline in the 1960 s and 1970 s cohorts; (4) the East and South-East Asia fertility transition pathway characterized by a late start in the mid- 20 th century with rapidly declining CTFRs. The exploration of societal conditions shaping fertility trends in the 19 th and 20 th centuries confirms Notestein’s conclusions that the causes are a complex combination of 'technological, social, economic, and political developments' as well as cultural and ideational effects, and that it is 'impossible to be precise about the various causal factors'. At times the primary factors were economic, as in the Great Depression of the 1930 s and the 1960 s post-war prosperity in Western countries. However, these economic factors also had many political, cultural, social, policy and other important facets. In Central and Eastern Europe the primary factors during the era of state socialism were the political system and social policies. The patriarchal nature of societies was the prime factor shaping fertility trends in Southern Europe and in East and South-East Asia. " (author's abstract).

The first road through Texas, El Camino Real de Los Tejas, utilized portions of these early trails. El Camino Carretera (known as the cart road) is an early segment of El Camino Real de los Tejas that crossed the Sabine River at the boundary between Texas and Louisiana. Using historical documents as well as empirical archaeological surveys, existing segments of El Camino Carretera have been located, mapped, and documented. Additionally, a GIS geodatabase model has been developed for managing the archaeological data with physical landscape data in a spatially responsive medium allowing for an integrated study of the landscape forces influencing {{the selection of a}} preferred road location...|$|R
40|$|The essay {{investigates the}} {{opportunities}} generated by recovering a <b>European</b> Pilgrimage Route’s <b>pathway</b> as device for landscape perception and territorial analysis. It {{is focused on}} a project conducted by Verdiana Network {{in collaboration with the}} Municipality of Asciano (Siena). The project aims to activate processes of landscape planning and management, and promote local tourism within the context of Asciano’s rural landscape and among the cultural and natural heritage intercepted by this pilgrimage route. It concerns the Siena branch of the Via Lauretana, the pilgrimage route toward the Sanctuary of Loreto in the Marche Region. The project focuses on the landscape structure of the route, modelled by the territorial dimension and spatial configuration of the itinerary, together with the social processes of landscape perception activated by the route itself. From this point of view, the project consisted of a process of discovering the landscape along the route and intercepting polar elements that make the itinerary the basis for the development of local tourism and cultural activities...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to explore the benefits and challenges of implementing a sustainable system for managing household organic material (HHOM) in the city of Rochester, NY. Elsewhere in the United States and the world, HHOM (i. e. excess food, yard matter, and compostable paper) has been increasingly diverted from landfills to organic waste-to-energy and composting <b>pathways</b> (<b>European</b> Environment Agency 2013 a; Skumatz and Freeman 2006). Landfill diversion is enabled by municipal projects that support source separation of HHOM out of the municipal solid waste (MSW) stream, thereby extracting valuable organic resources for higher-value processing (NYSDEC 2010). This has been done to increase the profitability of HHOM management (Eriksson et al. 2005) while simultaneously achieving benefits to the environment (e. g. life-cycle greenhouse gas reductions) (Ebner et al., 2014; Sanscartier et al. 2012; Environmental Protection Agency 2013 c) and society (e. g. community resilience; food security; local agriculture) (Sundkvist et al. 2001; Curtis 2003; Jansson 2013; Colding and Barthel 2013). In recent years, only 10...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory Bowel Disease (which {{includes}} Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis), is {{a chronic}} condition characterised by substantial morbidity. Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients are considered expensive to manage, hence accurate estimates of care costs {{are crucial to}} help healthcare providers plan clinical management. The {{aim of this study}} is to estimate the cost of care for Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis patients in the United Kingdom and Western mainland Europe. METHODS: Decision models were built to simulate the natural disease history of Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis, informed by United Kingdom and <b>European</b> clinical <b>pathways.</b> A healthcare provider perspective was adopted, model inputs were informed by published sources and expert opinion, and UK healthcare costs were used (2008 prices). Cohorts of 25 year old patients presenting with symptoms of varying severity were modelled over ten years, and annual treatment costs calculated per patient. RESULTS: The average annual cost of care per Crohn's Disease/Ulcerative Colitis patient was £ 631 /£ 762 (United Kingdom) and £ 838 /£ 796 (Europe). Most costs were incurred immediately following diagnosis, particularly in European Crohn's patients, reflecting the earlier use of more aggressive treatments. Surgery, hospitalisation, and the use of biological therapies and mesalazine (in Ulcerative Colitis) were key cost drivers. The total annual cost to the United Kingdom National Health Service of caring for Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients was estimated to be £ 131 million. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients are expensive to manage and illustrates the importance of differentiating between alternative clinical management scenarios...|$|R

40|$|Background: Residential {{care homes}} (RCHs) play an {{important}} role in end-of-life care, being the most common place of death for elderly people in several <b>European</b> countries. Care <b>pathways</b> such as the Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient (LCP) are used to improve and ensure quality care at the end of life. There is a lack of scientific evidence supporting the use of care pathways. Design: A descriptive qualitative study. Objective: The aim was to describe care professionals' experiences of using the Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient in the care of dying residents in residential care homes. Methods: Five focus group interviews and two individual interviews with enrolled nurses (n = 10), Registered Nurses (n = 9) and general practitioners (n = 5) were carried out and analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results: Care professionals expressed that they became confident through a shared approach to care, were supported to tailor the care according to the residents' individual needs, were supported to involve family members in decision-making and care and became more aware of the care environment. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that the LCP might be a useful tool for care professionals in improving end-of-life care in RCHs through increased attention to the goals of care, the individual needs of residents and family involvement...|$|R
40|$|A {{growing demand}} for {{resources}} and competition for land use, especially critical for Europe, is fueling the search for renewable and sustainable products. Innovative, resource-efficient and integrated approaches such as the development of marine biomass fed into integrated biorefineries may bring sustainable and cost-effective solutions to meet the growing needs. Algal biomass is no doubt considered a promising and valuable feedstock for a bio-based economy. Algae are fast-growing aquatic organisms {{and most of them}} are autotrophs: they convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, nitrogen and phosphorous (often available in excess) into valuable biomass components, which are of interest for a diverse group of industries, e. g., the food, feed, cosmetics and energy sectors (chapter 1). Despite the large potential of products derived from algae, its cultivation in Europe is still in its early stages and an estimation of the environmental sustainability may guide a further development and scale-up of this sector by highlighting its competitiveness (chapter 2). Chapter 3 illustrates the objectives of this PhD dissertation (addressed in Part I). In Part II, the environmental sustainability (specifically the life cycle resource footprint) of algae production under temperate climate conditions is assessed in an attempt to unravel the bottlenecks of current <b>European</b> production <b>pathways.</b> In chapter 4 and 5, the environmental footprint of microalgae production for higher value applications, and more specific as a feed ingredient, is examined. A first case study concerns an LCA study of microalgae production in Belgium in an innovative cultivation system for aquaculture purposes (chapter 4). Thereafter, the environmental resource footprint of an integrated algal biorefinery located in the Netherlands is assessed (chapter 5). Both case studies consider waste stream mitigation and a comparison was made with the footprint of alternative biomass plants such as soybeans. However, most envFpironmental sustainability assessment methods are rather semi-mature than well-established, which might result in incomplete LCA comparisons. Therefore, Part III of this PhD addresses the need to better quantify the environmental impacts related to surface use, both terrestrial land and sea surface, as this is not straightforward yet in life cycle assessment (LCA). Advanced LCA indicators are proposed in an attempt to better account for the impact of anthropogenic land and sea surface occupation. This development in the field of LCA enables a more fair comparison between the environmental resource footprint of aquatic algae, cultivated on marginal land or in the sea, versus terrestrial crops, of which most of them are grown on fertile land...|$|R
