5|$|As <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> about Cope and Marsh, I {{ran across}} Knight as {{something}} of a bit player in their lives. As I got further into the Cope and Marsh story, and I liked the two less and less as people—which is different from liking them as characters, of course—I wanted to have a character in the book for the readers to root for, and neither of the scientists could fill that role. When I found out that Knight had met Cope just before Cope died, I became convinced that he was the character I needed.|$|E

I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that was it. So when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if I was going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E

I found it very exciting. So the first time I read it, I was just reading it for enjoyment, really, because it was so well-written and exciting.

The film {{was met with}} reasonable reviews, and was a box office success, earning $256million worldwide. His performance was well received by critics; Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman wrote that Eckhart [...] "may be playing {{a bit of an}} ideal [...] but he makes goodness as palpable as he did yuppie evil in 'In the Company of Men'." [...] In an August 2004 interview, Eckhart claimed that he had not worked for nearly a year before he was cast in the movie. [...] "I felt like I sort of was getting away from what I wanted to do as an actor. [...] I had nine months off, but it wasn't a vacation. Sure, I didn't earn any money for nine months, but every day <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> scripts, I was producing my own material, I was taking meetings, I was working on my craft." ...|$|E

Three years later he wrote The Art of Seeing, in which he related: [...] "Within a couple of months <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> without spectacles and, what was better still, without strain and fatigue.... At the present time, my vision, though very far from normal, is about twice as good {{as it used to be}} when I wore spectacles." [...] Describing the process, Huxley wrote that [...] "Vision is not won by making an effort to get it: it comes to those who have learned to put their minds and eyes into a state of alert passivity, of dynamic relaxation." [...] He expressed indifference regarding the veracity of Bates' explanation of how the eye focuses, stating that [...] "my concern is not with the anatomical mechanism of accommodation, but with the art of seeing." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{reviewing}} the premiere release of Shojo Beat, IGN's Jessica Chobot sharply criticized the magazine. She felt it looked and read [...] "like a teenie-bopper magazine" [...] {{and referred to}} the issue's cover as a [...] "bright, hot-pink, migraine-inducing, bubble-lettered spectacle". She considered the contents boring, and disagreed with Viz's selection of series, noting, [...] "it's as if Viz had taken everything from their backed-up reject pile and tried to pull one over on the female populace. 90% of what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> was either poorly drawn or poorly written (more often than not, it was both)." [...] Comic World News David Welsh disagreed, as {{he felt that the}} magazine had several good series, and he praised Nana, Absolute Boyfriend and Crimson Hero as the top three series of the initial issue. Greg McElhatton, co-founder of [...] and former reviewer for iComics.com, praised the magazine's mainstream appearance, calling it a [...] "smart" [...] decision, as it would draw in its target audience by visually showing them that it's a magazine for teenage girls. While he felt that two of the manga titles in the premiere issue had weak openings, he found that the magazine was [...] "off to a good, if not great start".|$|E

500|$|According to Neil Finn, [...] "It (Time on Earth) doesn't {{sound like}} any one {{particular}} Crowded House album, {{but it has}} elements of Crowded House... {{in as much as}} Nick and I make a sound together when we play and always did. I think there's a lot of heart and spirit in the album which is connected with the loss of our dear friend Paul but also an attempt to try and make sense of it and move forward. And as such, it seemed the most obvious and {{best way to do that}} was to be playing music again with each other, Nick and I. I want to be in a band and what other band could it be." [...] Crowded House's leader, Neil Finn has indicated that, as the album began life as a solo project, its sound is generally different from Crowded House, though similar in parts, indicating that no one album by the group sounds like this one. As the album is dedicated to Hester and attends to his death, much of the album has a mournful tone, however this has been received well by critics, with some indicating that [...] "fortunately, Finn is a master at expressing ambiguity, (both) lyrically and musically". Finn has said of the song [...] "People Are Like Suns", that [...] "Part of it is the idea that people burn brightly and then they fade out. Also, when I wrote it, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> Ian McEwan's novel Saturday, which begins with a man on his balcony watching his plane go down, so the first lines borrow something from that image." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} {{decided to keep}} {{publicity}} down during the recording of their fourth album, as the group was taken aback by such press surrounding Infinity on High. Sessions proved to {{be difficult for the}} band as Wentz started taking LSD when Zach Blair lead guitarist for Rise Against made him try it at a party in April 2008. The goal in Wentz using LSD was to hope it would influence his songwriting, but it just made him distracted from writing songs, which annoyed Stump, so he stopped using LSD in August 2008. Wentz later said he had taken LSD over 50 times. Stump called the making of the album [...] "painful", noting that he and Wentz quarreled over many issues, revealing [...] "I threw something across the room over a major-to-minor progression." [...] On previous albums, Trohman felt he and Hurley did not have enough musical freedom and that Stump and Wentz exerted too much control over the group: [...] "I felt, 'Man, this isn't my band anymore.' It's no one's fault, and I don't want to make it seem that way. It was more of a complex I developed based off of stuff <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reading.</b> It's hard to hear, 'Joe and Andy are just along for the ride.'" [...] To amend the situation, Trohman sat down with Stump to communicate his concerns, which led to more collaboration on Folie à Deux. [...] "It made me feel like I owned the songs a lot more. It made me really excited about contributing to Fall Out Boy and made me find my role in the band," [...] Trohman recalled.|$|E

Stump entered the studio with music for almost 50 songs.

But spoken, English is a busy traffic of dialects, accents, and slang words going in and out of fashion. Slang is especially fascinating. I love outdated slang dictionaries—these words are artifacts that tell you the mindset and squeamish taboos of a certain milieu during a certain time period. I wanted the English in the book to be a hyperbole of that everyday dynamism of spoken English." ...|$|E
