In the trial the {{addition}} of pea varietas breed GOTIK with the highest content of antinutritive factors and commonly used mixture (fed in <b>group</b> <b>G</b> 01) was compared. The tentative mixtures contained following amounts of pea: <b>group</b> <b>G</b> 9 – 9  %, <b>group</b> <b>G</b> 18 – 18  % and <b>group</b> <b>G</b> 27 – 27  %. The average daily gain were: the control <b>group</b> <b>G</b> 01 : 0. 425 ± 0. 110, <b>group</b> <b>G</b> 9 : 0. 395 ± 0. 121, <b>group</b> <b>G</b> 18 : 0. 358 ± 0. 108 and <b>group</b> <b>G</b> 27 : 0. 315 ± 0. 113  kg. Out of these numbers ensues that with higher amount of pea GOTIK the average daily gain was decreasing. In the feed conversion there appeared a similar decrease of efficiency too. In the control <b>group</b> <b>G</b> 01 the feed conversion was 2. 02 ± 0. 10, in <b>group</b> <b>G</b> 9 2. 16 ± 0. 22, in <b>group</b> <b>G</b> 18 2. 34 ± 0. 08 and in <b>group</b> <b>G</b> 27 2. 46 ± 0. 18  kg. Also, with the higher content of GOTIK in feeding mixture the food intake was lower. The differences in efficiency were among the pigletsę gender too. Eventhough grunters have in this age category higher growth rate than gilts, their results were worse. Our opinion is, that this efficiency decrease could be caused by high content of antinutritive factors in GOTIK. Resulting values of gain and feeds conversion indicate feasible substitution of soya-bean meal by feeding pea, and thus decrease the dependence of mixed feed mill on these componentęs import in production of feeding mixtures for growing pigs...|$|R

Forty Morse taper connections and forty solid abutments were used at different torque levels (repeated after 10 minutes) in the following groups (n = 10) : 25 Ncm (<b>group</b> <b>g</b> 1), 30 Ncm (<b>group</b> <b>g</b> 2), 35 Ncm (<b>group</b> <b>g</b> 3), and 40 Ncm (<b>group</b> <b>g</b> 4). The samples were embedded in a metallographic resin, sectioned lengthwise, and polished.

Throat swabs were obtained from 89 cats (47 males and 42 females) and vaginal swabs from 39 female cats. Eighty-three of the examined cats were housed in individual cages at a University Animal Care Facility. Six cats, 2 mature males, 2 mature females and 2 young females were family pets in a rural area. Beta-hemolytic streptococci were recovered from 33 (37 %) of the 89 cat throats cultured, and 27 (30. 3 %) were identified as <b>group</b> <b>G.</b> More males (34 %) than females (24 %) had throat cultures positive for <b>group</b> <b>G.</b> From the 39 vaginal cultures examined, 24 (61. 5 %) contained beta-hemolytic streptococci and 23 (58. 9 %) were identified as <b>group</b> <b>G</b> streptococci.

More <b>group</b> <b>G</b> cat isolates (81 %) produced deoxyribonuclease (DNase) than did the human isolates (36 %). The proportion of cat throat and vaginal isolates producing DNase was the same. Production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide glycohydrolase (NADase) by <b>group</b> <b>G</b> isolates of human origin was 70 %, cat throat isolates 53 % and cat vaginal isolates 37 %. The Serum Opacity Factor was present in 73 % of the cat throat isolates of <b>group</b> <b>G,</b> 43. 7 % of the cat vaginal isolates and 58. 6 % of the human isolates.
