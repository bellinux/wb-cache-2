5|$|The cooking of {{the area}} {{is not to be}} {{confused}} with the Mediterranean diet, made popular because of the apparent health benefits of a diet rich in olive oil, wheat and other grains, fruits, vegetables, and a certain amount of seafood, but low in meat and dairy products. Mediterranean cuisine encompasses the ways that these and other ingredients, including meat, are <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> kitchen, whether they are health-giving or not.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea, {{in their}} usual home strip of blue, kicked-off the match and {{immediately}} lost possession when Walcott dispossessed Matic. Walcott sent {{the ball to}} Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, whose cross on the right forced a punch from Thibaut Courtois. Francis Coquelin conceded a free kick in the sixth minute having fouled Willian inside Chelsea's half, though nothing came of the set piece. Fàbregas went down under the challenge of Per Mertesacker in Arsenal's penalty area soon afterwards, but his appeal for a penalty kick was turned down by referee Anthony Taylor and play resumed. Chelsea, having settled the slower of the two teams, began to dominate ball possession and won two early corners, {{both of which were}} easily <b>dealt</b> <b>with.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 17th minute, Nacho Monreal's charge forward was stopped by Cahill; the Chelsea defender in the process of making that challenge had suffered a nose bleed. A free kick for Arsenal presented a chance for Walcott to score, but his header goalwards was saved.|$|E
5|$|Burnell was {{the chief}} and most {{influential}} of Edward I's advisers {{during the first half}} of his reign. As part of his duties Burnell spent most of his time in attendance on the king. He heard many requests and petitions from those who desired patronage or other advancements, and was diligent and active in dealing with routine business. Burnell played a leading role in the legislation introduced by King Edward. The king's major legislative acts mainly date to Burnell's tenure of the office of chancellor, from 21 September 1274 until Burnell's death in 1292. Burnell was instrumental in the enforcement of royal writs and enactments, including the Statutes of Westminster, enacted in 1275, 1285, and 1290. Those of 1275 attempted to deal with the usurpation of royal rights. Keeping the peace in the realm and the extension of royal jurisdiction to cover rape was <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> statutes from 1285, along with a number of other issues. The last statute, from 1290, regulated land law, the result of pressure from the magnates, the leading laymen of England.|$|E

25|$|WSUD regards urban {{stormwater}} runoff as {{a resource}} rather than a nuisance or liability. This represents a paradigm shift in the way environmental resources and water infrastructure are <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> planning and design of towns and cities.|$|E
25|$|The {{whole of}} the {{articles}} of the project is relatively brief; it had 2,144 articles. Each article grouped in several paragraphs {{the solution to the}} issues related with the subject that was <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> article, which made them dense but facilitated their study.|$|E
25|$|In a Security Council {{meeting on}} 9 February 1971, Somalia {{objected to the}} {{credentials}} of the representative of Republic of China as China representation, and ROC and the United States responded {{that the question of}} China's representation should not be <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Security Council.|$|E

25|$|Parts of the A21 {{follow the}} turnpike roads: one being the section from Sevenoaks to Tunbridge Wells, opened in 1710; other {{sections}} of the road were similarly <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> century.|$|R
25|$|The {{problem with}} this {{continuum}} approximation for a Bose gas is that the ground state has been effectively ignored, giving a degeneracy of zero for zero energy. This inaccuracy becomes serious when dealing with the Bose–Einstein condensate and will be <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next section.|$|E
25|$|The High Court's {{jurisdiction}} is as follows: generally, a {{civil case}} is commenced in the High Court if {{the subject matter of}} the claim exceeds S$250,000. Probate matters are <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> High Court if the value of the estate exceeds S$3 million or if the case involves the resealing of a foreign grant. In addition, ancillary matters in family proceedings involving assets of S$1.5 million or above are heard in the High Court.|$|E
25|$|Simultaneously, extramarital {{relations}} {{with a free}} woman were severely <b>dealt</b> <b>with.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case of adultery, the cuckold had {{the legal right to}} kill the offender if caught in the act; the same went for rape. Female adulterers, and by extension prostitutes, were forbidden to marry or take part in public ceremonies. The average age of marriage being 30 for men, the young Athenian had no choice if he wanted to have sexual relations other than to turn to slaves or prostitutes.|$|E
25|$|The English Court of Common Pleas <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> {{lawsuits}} <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> Monarch had no interest, i.e., between commoners.|$|R

25|$|Famous Englishmen who stammered were King George VI and Prime Minister Winston Churchill, {{who led the}} UK through World War II. George VI {{went through}} years of speech therapy, most {{successfully}} under Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue, for his stammer. This is <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Academy Award-winning film The King's Speech (2010) in which Colin Firth plays George VI. The film {{is based on an}} original screenplay by David Seidler who also used to stutter as a child until age 16.|$|E
25|$|Another {{argument}} {{contends that}} the state developed out {{of economic and social}} crises that were prominent in late-medieval Europe. Religious wars between Catholics and Protestants, and the involvement of leaders in the domains of other leaders under religious reasons was the primary problem <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Peace of Westphalia. In addition, Marxist theory {{contends that the}} economic crisis of feudalism forced the aristocracy to adapt various centralized forms of organization so they could retain economic power, and this resulted {{in the formation of the}} modern state.|$|E
25|$|In statistics, linear {{least squares}} {{problems}} correspond to a particularly important type of statistical model called linear regression which arises as a {{particular form of}} regression analysis. One basic form of such a model is an ordinary least squares model. The present article concentrates on the mathematical aspects of linear least squares problems, with discussion of the formulation and interpretation of statistical regression models and statistical inferences related to these being <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> articles just mentioned. See outline of regression analysis for an outline of the topic.|$|E

It is also {{the location of the}} first wildlife overbridge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom, near Lamberhurst.|$|R
25|$|The {{reaction}} from fans {{to the pilot}} is generally mixed. Although praised for its high quality animation, fans simply felt that the pilot for the most part, came across as too campy for a comic (especially {{under the guidance of}} John Byrne and Chris Claremont) with often dark and adult oriented themes like X-Men. The on-screen action sequences had to be severely curtailed for a children's cartoon show, and the episode only superficially deals with the sort of social issues often <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> comics, such as isolation, intolerance, racism and bigotry.|$|E
25|$|Appeals from {{criminal}} {{decisions of}} the court are <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same manner as appeals from criminal {{decisions of the}} Local Court. However, unlike normal criminal cases, appeals go to the Industrial Court of New South Wales rather than the Supreme Court of New South Wales or the District Court of New South Wales. In civil matters, there is a right of appeal to the Industrial Court as well. This is a full right of appeal unlike the usual civil proceedings appeals which are limited {{to a point of}} law.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the German-built vessels and the 1898 series that {{included}} Brand, was criticized for having insufficient speed. Although considered as having quite good seagoing characteristics, the vessels had difficulty firing torpedoes in rough seas. In calm seas the boats were hard to spot, with little engine noise or bow wave, which increased {{the chance of a}} successful torpedo attack. The boats were also seen as not being manoeuvrable enough, as well as having an exposed bridge in a bow turret and poor ventilation. Some of the issues of the early vessels were <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last four 1.-class boats built.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an optimality-theoretic {{account of the}} relation between pronouns and R-expressions which offers a new way of analyzing apparent Principle C effects in so-called reconstruction contexts. It is argued that this phenomenon can be <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> syntax <b>in</b> <b>the</b> course of the derivation. The basic assumption is that the relevant binding principles are violable constraints that are checked in local optimization procedures after the completion of each phrase. Thus, ungrammatical structures are ruled out immediately during the derivation, and reconstruction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> traditional sense might be a superfluous mechanism...|$|R

A simple strategy exploiting reconstructions obtained at different time instants in order to detect slowly moving scatterers is also experimentally validated. 1...|$|R

25|$|Dodo's {{life after}} she left the Doctor was not <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> programme. The {{spin-off}} novel Who Killed Kennedy by David Bishop reveals that Dodo suffered a nervous breakdown {{and was unable to}} remember her adventures with the Doctor, drifting in and out of psychiatric institutions. Becoming involved with a journalist who was investigating the truth behind UNIT, Dodo is murdered by a pawn of the Master. Her funeral is attended only by her lover and an unidentified man who, based on the limited description provided, may be either the Second or Seventh Doctor. The canonicity of the novels in relation to the television series is open to question.|$|E
25|$|On March 26, 1979, Israel and Egypt {{signed the}} Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty. Among other things, the treaty {{provided}} for the withdrawal by Israel of its armed forces and civilians from the Sinai Peninsula, which Israel had captured during the Six-Day War. The Egyptians agreed to keep the Sinai Peninsula demilitarized. The final status of the Gaza Strip, and other relations between Israel and Palestinians, was not <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treaty. Egypt renounced all territorial claims to territory north of the international border. The Gaza Strip remained under Israeli military administration until 1994. During that time, the military {{was responsible for the}} maintenance of civil facilities and services.|$|E
25|$|Express trust: An {{express trust}} arises where a settlor {{deliberately}} and consciously decides {{to create a}} trust, over their assets, either now, or upon his or her later death. In these cases this will be achieved by signing a trust instrument, which will either be a will or a trust deed. Almost all trusts <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trust industry are of this type. They contrast with resulting and constructive trusts. The intention of the parties to create the trust must be shown clearly by their language or conduct. For an express trust to exist, there must be certainty to the objects of the trust and the trust property. In the USA Statute of Frauds provisions require express trusts to be evidenced in writing if the trust property is above a certain value, or is real estate.|$|E
40|$|Review of the {{literature}} on African-American dance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean. The author focuses on 3 problems. The first is the construction of canons <b>in</b> dance anthropology. <b>The</b> second has to do <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ways <b>in</b> which these canons have <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> dance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean <b>in</b> particular. Finally, <b>the</b> author examines issues 'surrounding the ways anthropology creates its objects of study'...|$|R

40|$|Extract: Although both {{arbitration}} and mediation are {{forms of}} alternative dispute resolution (ADR) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{sense that they}} are alternative processes to trial, the two dispute management processes are usually not <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> together <b>in</b> <b>the</b> literature or <b>in</b> training. There are obvious reasons for this, including the fact that arbitration and mediation are very different processes requiring very different sets of skills...|$|R
