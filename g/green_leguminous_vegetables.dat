The aim {{of this study is to}} determine carotenoïds, vitamin A and vitamin E contents in dishes consumed by Cameroonians living in a rural area which is a malaria endemic zone, called Ngali II. The dishes consumed by the people of this area are sauce prepared from several <b>green</b> leafy <b>vegetables,</b> <b>leguminous</b> seeds and cucurbit seeds, tubers and plantains. The nutrient contents were determined by High Performance Liquid Chromatography. The results obtained are expressed in micrograms per 100 grams dry weight: α-caroten 0 - 6434. 7; ß-caroten 0 - 15612. 5; vitamin A 0 - 1442. 4 and vitamin E 0 - 40776. The dishes of fourth group have higher nutrient contents: 3808. 52; 8722. 50; 1761. 65 and 18048 micrograms per 100 grams dry weight respectively for α-caroten, ß-caroten, vitamin A and vitamin E. Therefore, higher consumption of dishes for this group is recommended to prevent various infections like malaria in Ngali II. © Lavoisier - La photocopie non autorisée est un délit.

Recently, contamination of soils and vegetables caused by mining activities is of great social concern because of the potential risk to human health, especially to the residents whom live near metal or metalloid mines. In this study, 18 topsoil and 141 vegetable samples were collected from the contaminated areas in Daye City Hubei Province, China and the concentrations of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) were analyzed. A self-designed questionnaire was assigned to obtain the exposure scenario and the USEPA health risk assessment model was adopted to assess two type of risks (non-carcinogenic risks and carcinogenic risks) of vegetables to humans. The results showed that the average contents of metal(loid) s in soils exceeded the background value of Daye City. The average contents of metal(loid) s, especially As, Cd, Pb, in three kinds of vegetables were significantly higher than the permissible values based on Chinese national standard. Leafy vegetables had relatively higher concentrations and the transfer factors of As (0. 015), Cd (0. 080) and Pb (0. 003) were comparable to <b>leguminous</b> and fruit <b>vegetables.</b> <b>Leguminous</b> <b>vegetables</b> had relatively higher concentrations and transfer factors of Cu (0. 032) and Zn (0. 094) than leafy and fruit vegetables. The transfer factors from soil to plants follows a decreasing order as Cd (0. 068), Zn (0. 047) > Cu (0. 023) > As (0. 006), Pb (0. 002). Furthermore, health risk assessment revealed the following results: the non-carcinogenic risk decreased in the order of children, adult, adolescent, while the carcinogenic risk followed a decreasing order of adult, adolescent, children; the calculated carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risk of the metal(loid) s by vegetable consumption decreased in the order of leafy vegetables > fruit <b>vegetables</b> > <b>leguminous</b> <b>vegetables.</b> The relatively lower transfer factors and lower risks may suggest that <b>leguminous</b> and fruit <b>vegetables</b> are more suitable for planting in Daye City.

From February to July 2010 we applied food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) to 58 dyads of Maya mothers and their children (7 - 9 years old). The FFQ was developed by the staff of the Human Ecology Group at Cinvestav and included 78 foods, grouped in: cereals and tubers, foods of animal origin, <b>leguminous</b> <b>vegetables,</b> fats, fruits, vegetables, sugars, and daily products. The frequencies of consumption were classified in four levels: 1) no consumption, 2) low (1 - 2 days/week), 3) medium (3 - 4 days/week), high (5 - 7 days/week). The observed pattern suggests a low consumption of fruits and vegetables, a medium consumption of pork, eggs, oil and lard, and a high consumption of soda and whole milk. From these frequencies we extrapolated that the dietetic pattern is characterized by a low intake of fibre and micronutrients and high intake of fat and sugars, findings supported by previous National and regional studies.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Battery {{production}} {{is one of}} the main sources of heavy metals that present great harm to human health even in low concentrations. Chromium (Cr), Cadmium (Cd) and Lead (Pb) were measured in edible portions of vegetables and soils around a battery production area in China, and the potential health risk of heavy metal contamination to the local population via veg-etable consumption was evaluated. Their concentrations in edible portions of vegetables were 2. 354 (0. 078 - 14. 878), 0. 035 (0. 003 - 0. 230) and 0. 039 (0. 003 - 0. 178) mg kg− 1, respectively. Approximately 3 % of the Cd in the vegetable samples exceeded the maximum concentration allowable by national food safety criteria, although Pb content in all samples were within the criteria. Transfer factors (TF) from soils to vegetables were dependent on <b>vegetable</b> species. <b>Leguminous</b> <b>vegetables</b> were more likely to accumulate Cr, while leaf vegetables tended to show higher levels of concentration of Cd and Pb. Melon vegetables demonstrated a relatively low capacity for accumulating the heavy metals studied. TF were positively correlated with soil organic matter and negatively correlated with soil pH.

Ghana’s economy has grown substantially over the past decade, yet remains primarily agrarian, accounting for 50 % of the total employment and 25 % of the country’s Gross Domestic Product. Smallholder rain-fed farming using rudimentary technologies dominates the agricultural sector accounting for 80 % of total agricultural production. Approximately 90 % of smallholder farms are less than two hectares in size, and produce a diversity of crops. The major crops cultivated in Ghana include numerous cereal, root and tuber, <b>leguminous,</b> fruit, <b>vegetable</b> and industrial crops. Maize is the most widely cultivated crop in Ghana, and accounts for {{a significant proportion of}} the daily caloric intake. However, significant yield gaps exist where actual maize yields are 50 to 80 % less than achievable yields. The following document was written after conducting a three month 2012 summer internship in Ghana as an agronomic expert volunteer for the Ghana Agricultural Development and Value Chain Enhancement (ADVANCE) Project. My primary objectives included monitoring ADVANCE crop production demonstration plots and farmers’ fields to diagnose and address crop health issues, with the goal of identifying why smallholders in the north continue to get lower than expected yields even when good agronomic practices (GAPs) are being implemented. Observations indicate GAPs are not being adopted, partly because they are not often being implemented correctly at demonstration plots. The benefits of GAPs can be better realized through improved planning, communication, cooperation and education among all participants. This document is divided into four chapters.

Despite this, {{little is known about the}} commonly practiced composting systems in Malawi and their potential in mitigating soil fertility problems experienced by smallholder farmers. This study characterized the Changu (turned and watered regularly) and Chimato (covered with mud and static) systems and investigated optimum conditions required for effective composting. It further investigated nutrient release characteristics of the composts from these systems and their impact on maize crop establishment. Replicated compost heaps were formed from wheat (Triticum aestivum) straw and grass /clover (Lolium perenne/Trifolium repens) (in the UK) and maize (Zea mays L.) straw and green bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) residue (in Malawi) using the Changu and Chimato systems. Four initial C:N ratios of 20 : 1, 25 : 1, 30 : 1 and 60 : 1 were studied in the UK whereas two initial C:N ratios of 20 : 1 and 30 : 1, chopped into two lengths (5 or 10 cm) were used in Malawi. All the treatments were set in a randomized complete block design and the composting experiments ran for 112 days in the UK study and for 77 days in Malawi. Incubation-mineralization studies using the resultant composts were run for 42 days and 84 days for UK and Malawi respectively, followed by a maize establishment study run for 25 days. The Changu systems had significantly longer mesophilic phases (19 days) and active composting periods (24 days) compared to the Chimato systems (14 and 22 days respectively). The temperature profiles for the two systems were similar in the glasshouse, but differed in the field due to reduced insulation in the Changu (uncovered) system. The composting processes in these systems contributed to the production of compost with as high as 1. 1 % total N. A higher concentration of NO 3 -N (406 mg/kg dwt.) was produced in the Changu system cf. Chimato (359 mg/kg dwt.) whereas a higher concentration of NH 4 -N (36 mg/kg dwt.) was produced in the Chimato system cf. Changu (34 mg/kg dwt.) for the Malawi compost. Similarly, Changu system resulted in greater concentrations of TON (61 mg/kg dwt.) cf. Chimato (24 mg/kg dwt.) whilst Chimato contained high concentration of NH 4 -N (61 mg/kg dwt.) cf. Changu (8 mg/kg dwt.) for the UK compost. No differences were observed in the concentration of extractable-P and extractable-K in the two systems for the UK studies whereas Changu treatments and those from initial C:N had more P in Malawi. Resultant compost pH ranged between 6. 8 and 8. 6 for the UK-based studies and between 7. 2 and 8. 9 for the Malawian-based study. Incubation-mineralization studies indicated temporal differences when the resultant compost from the two systems (Changu and Chimato) was incubated in the soil with respect to nutrient release. Initial feedstock C:N ratio had a significant effect, treatments with C:N 20 : 1 mineralized nitrogen whilst those with initial C:N 30 : 1 and 60 : 1 immobilized nitrogen compared to the control for the UK experiments. No immobilization was observed for Malawi resultant compost. This was reflected in the maize establishment trials when compost from the two systems was used as a soil amendment. Treatment with materials from initial C:N 20 : 1 produced significantly larger plant stalks and high plant biomass (0. 92 g/plant (dry basis)) than the other treatments. Varied differences were observed between UK and Malawi with respect to composting system on plant growth. The use of compost from this study increased CEC of the soil by 2. 1 cmol/kg. Efficient composting requires low C:N material and the required compost time and resultant quality is dependent upon the C:N ratio of the initial feedstock. The longer active composting time in the Changu systems appeared to influence production of TON compared to the Chimato. It is suggested that to optimise the compost quality there is a need to encourage the smallholder farmers to grow <b>green</b> <b>leguminous</b> crops which they can mix with the straw to reduce the initial C:N ratio to improve its compostability. It is also important to increase the number of aeration holes in the mud coat of the Chimato heap in order to improve the oxygenation process of the material and to use them for moisture adjustments. A cost benefit analysis conducted suggested that the lower the initial C:N ratio and the longer the chop length (≤ 10 cm), composting using the Changu system, the higher the net benefits which can be attained.

The utilization of nitrogen by sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) fertilized with sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.) and ammonium sulfate (AS) was evaluated using the 15 N tracer technique. N was added {{at the rate of}} 196 and 70 kg ha- 1 as 15 Nlabeled sunn hemp green manure (SH) and as ammonium sulfate (AS), respectively. Treatments were: (i) Control; (ii) AS 15 N; (iii) SH 15 N + AS; (iv) SH 15 N; and (v) AS 15 N + SH. Sugarcane was cultivated for five years and was harvested three times. 15 N recovery was evaluated in the two first harvests. In the sum of the three harvests, the highest stalk yields were obtained with a combination of green manure and inorganic N fertilizer; however, in the second cutting the yields were higher where SH was used than in plots with AS. The recovery of N by the first two consecutive harvests accounted for 19 to 21 % of the N applied as <b>leguminous</b> <b>green</b> manure and 46 to 49 % of the N applied as AS.

40|$|Maize {{production}} in smallholder farming systems in Kenya is largely limited by low soil fertility. As mineral fertilizer is expensive, <b>green</b> manuring using <b>leguminous</b> cover crops {{could be an}} alternative strategy for farmers to enhance farm productivity. However due to variability in soil type and crop management, the effects of green manure are likely to differ with farms. The objectives {{of this study were}} to evaluate Mucuna pruriens and Arachis pintoi on (i) biomass and nitrogen fixation (^ 15 N natural abundance), (ii) soil carbon and nitrogen stocks and (iii) their effects on maize yields over two cropping seasons in Kakamega, Western Kenya. Mucuna at 6 weeks accumulated 1 – 1. 3 Mg ha^{- 1 } of dry matter and 33 – 56 kg ha^{- 1 } nitrogen of which 70 % was nitrogen derived from the atmosphere (Ndfa). Arachis after 12 months accumulated 2 – 2. 7 Mg ha^{- 1 } of dry matter and 51 – 74 kg N ha^{- 1 } of which 52 - 63 % was from Ndfa. Soil carbon and nitrogen stocks at 0 – 15 cm depth were enhanced by 2 - 4 Mg C ha^{- 1 } and 0. 3 – 1. 0 Mg N ha^{- 1 } under Mucuna and Arachis fallow, irrespective of soil type. Maize yield increased by 0. 5 - 2 Mg ha^{- 1 } in Mucuna and 0. 5 – 3 Mg ha^{- 1 } in Arachis and the response was stronger on Nitisol than on Acrisol or Ferralsol. We concluded that leguminous cover crops seem promising in enhancing soil fertility and maize yields in Kenya, provided soil conditions and rainfall are suitable...|$|R
40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} in Tuscany (Central Italy) to assess the contribution of different amendments in combination with a green manure legume cover crop (Trifolium subterraneum L.) to organic spring potato (cv. Monna Lisa) nutrition. The experimental field was divided into three blocks (replicates) and each of them was split in two main strips, representing different management systems, in which a subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) green manure was cultivated or not. Within each strip, elementary plots, which received farmyard cattle manure or green compost at three different rates, corresponding to an amount of N 0, 50 and 100 kg ha- 1, were randomly distributed according to a split-plot layout. Potato yield, N uptake and use efficiency were measured during the cropping cycle and at crop harvest. Furthermore, soil mineral N dynamics was studied to evaluate the potential impact on the environment by combination of compost application and <b>leguminous</b> <b>green</b> manure. Results obtained demonstrated that the cultivation of clover green manure and the application of farmyard manure substantially increased the total potato yield of 22. 5 % and 25. 1 %, respectively. The highest dose of organic amendments applied to the crop enhanced the potato production and N use efficiency by 43. 3 % and 16. 9 %, compared with the unfertilized control. However, the combination of clover green manure and amendments distribution did not increase the soil mineral N at the end of potato cropping cycle. These findings indicate {{that it is possible to}} modify the agronomical practices in organic potato production without enhanced potential environmental risks due to N leaching. On the basis of these results, effective strategies based on legume green manure combined with organic amendments application can be developed for establishing both new agronomical practices and N fertilizer methodologies applied to organic potato production...|$|R

Trifolium alexandrianum, Medicago polymorpha and Melilotus parviflora on growth, yield and vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) colonization in maize (Zea mays L.) was examined and compared with recommended NPK fertilizers. The three green manuring plants contained 4. 44, 2. 45 and 3. 17 % nitrogen; 0. 065, 0. 089 and - 0. 122 % phosphorus and 1. 24, 1. 89 and 0. 8 % potassium, respectively. NPK fertilizers suppressed VAM colonization whereas green manures generally favoured it. The study of correlation coefficient revealed {{that there was}} a variable pattern of correlation between N, P and K contents of green manures and various parameters of VAM colonization, at different growth stages. All the soil amendments enhanced shoot growth in terms of length and biomass, at all the three growth stages. Effect of Trifolium was similar to that of NPK fertilizers while Medicago and Melilotus were proved significantly superior than NPK fertilizers in increasing shoot biomass. Negative and significant correlation of shoot length and biomass with N contents of green manures was observed whereas with P content the correlation was positive and highly significant. Root length and biomass was increased by NPK fertilizers and either of the green manure amendment. Pattern of correlation of root length and biomass with N and P contents of green manures was similar to that of shoot. Highest cob biomass was recorded in mixed green manure followed by Medicago and Melilotus, respectively. Difference was significant as compared with control, NPK fertilizers and Trifolium. A highly significant and negative correlation was recorded between cob biomass and N content of the green manures.

40|$|Vegetables {{are among}} the main {{ingredients}} of the Mediterranean cuisine and thus enlarging organic local markets increase their demand for a diversity of vegetables. Long-term rotations based mainly on vegetables are rather rare in the Mediterranean countries. A four year experiment was carried out between 2006 and 2010 at Ege University Department of Horticulture in cooperation with CIHEAM Mediterranean Institute of Bari. And two different pre-crops, broccoli and vetch were tested under an organic management system as compared to fallow during the autumn-winter period. The summer main crops were rotated between solanaceous and cucurbitaceous vegetables as tomato (2007), zucchini (2008) pepper (2009) and eggplant (2010). The experiment aimed at recommending sustainable rotation plans for organic vegetable growers in western Turkey. Broccoli represented the farmers’ choice as a winter vegetable prior to the summer crop. Vetch (incorporated) was selected as <b>leguminous</b> <b>green</b> manure well adapted to the regional conditions. All the management including disease and pests were handled according to the organic regulations valid in Turkey and the EU. Soil fertility was maintained by incorporation of crop residues {{at the end of}} both cycles and addition of organic-certified commercial compost and compost tea during the main cycle as a standard amendment. Effect of pre crops and main crops on soil organic matter and, primary nutrients, and weed abundance and yield were assessed for each main crop cycle. Soil organic matter values showed significant differences before and after the winter or summer cycle and fluctuated between 0. 7 and 3. 0 %. Soil N, P and K contents were kept at rich or sufficient levels for four years. The variation in soil organic matter, N, P and K displayed similar trends during in the tested precrop and fallow control plots during the four year period. The broccoli plots had lower soil potassium levels compared to the other two. Weed diversity varied according to the annual climatic conditions however broccoli exhibited a marked weed suppressing effect mainly due to shading and allelopathy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRice yields in soils of low soil {{organic matter}} may benefit from {{preceding}} <b>leguminous</b> <b>green</b> manure crops. A pre-rice crop experiment, including groundnut (Arachis hypogaea), mung-bean (Vigna radiata), Sesbania (Sesbania rostrata), and a mixture of Sesbania and multipurpose cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) was conducted on a characteristic sandy soil of North East Thailand. The Sesbania-cowpea intercrop gave a similar total plant biomass as the Sesbania green manure alone (7 t ha− 1) but with the advantage to yield an edible product. The direct economic yield of cowpea was 1. 3 t ha− 1 green beans and greater than that achieved with groundnut or mungbean. The Sesbania-cowpea combination also proved to enhance rice yields by 0. 8 t ha− 1. The benefits in rice production were similar to the Sesbania green manure alone but surpassed the yields with the other grain crops or urea fertilizer of 30 – 60 kg N ha− 1. Sesbania dry matter production increased with increasing planting density. The resulting variation in plant quality, e. g. lignin, however, was low. Rice responses to treatments were more related to the total residue N yields than to changes in plant quality. Apart from mungbean (25 %) the pre-rice leguminous crops were able to obtain a considerable (> 39 %) proportion of their N from N 2 fixation. The green manure Sesbania however fixed a larger proportion (79 – 89 %) of its N than the grain crops (25 – 62 %). This led not only to high amounts of N 2 fixed by Sesbania but together with a N harvest index of zero yielded a large systems N benefit. With grain legumes this benefit was moderated by the N export in harvestable products. In the case of mungbean this may even result in effective soil N mining. Residue N use efficiency varied between 19 – 29 % and {{was similar to that}} obtained from a single application of chemical N fertilizer (17 – 28 %). For the farmer the Sesbania-cowpea intercrop option seems thus the most promising one not only regarding rice yield benefits but also in terms of soil fertility enhancement and generation of edible products...|$|R
40|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} one of the most {{prevailing}} cancers worldwide with particularly high incidence and mortality rates in the Western countries. Compelling evidence indicates that diet is considered as an important etiological factor of colorectal cancer risk. Consumption of vegetables has been shown in numerous epidemiological, case-control and prospective studies to be inversely associated with the pathogenesis of several cancers including cancers of colon and rectum. <b>Leguminous</b> and cruciferous <b>vegetables</b> abundant in every day diet are a rich source of many bioactive compounds. Some of those phytochemicals such as glucosinolates and their derivatives, flavonoids - especially isoflavones and saponins have been demonstrated to be potent chemoprotective agents with an ability to inhibit carcinogenesis. Recently, sprouting seed of many plants has been popularized as a healthy and nutritious food plentiful in proteins, minerals, vitamins and a range of phytochemicals. The germination process results in significant increases in concentrations of particular compounds as compared to the mature plants and may contribute to enhanced anticancer activity of sprouts. The focus of this study was primarily to evaluate the anti-cancer effects of the extracts prepared from leguminous (alfalfa, red clover) and cruciferous (Raab broccoli, Daikon radish) sprouts on key stages of colon carcinogenesis, namely initiation, promotion and invasion using in vitro model systems. The shoots were investigated as a commercial product - BroccoShoots sprouts mixture which were processed following extraction methods to obtain crude juice, methanol and in vitro digested extracts to assess how changes in the chemical characteristics could affect the biological activity of the samples. BroccoShoots extract at the highest concentrations (100, 150, 200 ug/ml) inhibited growth of CaCo- 2 cells. At non-toxic range of concentrations (0 - 50 ug/ml) BroccoShoots extracts reduced H 202 induced DNA damage in CaCo- 2 cells and significantly inhibited migration and invasion of the HT 115 cell-line. These effects appeared to be stronger for the crude juice extracts than for the other two types of extracts. There were no evident changes in the epithelial integrity of CaCo- 2 cells (measured as trans-epithelial electrical resistance) and in cell cycle progression (24 hours) after exposure to the extracts. Then individual plants were prepared as crude juice extracts to examine the extent to which particular species contributed to the overall activity of the mixture. It was found that anti-genotoxic, anti-proliferative, anti-migrative and anti-invasive effects observed for Daikon radish extracts were the highest among all individual sprouts. Further, Daikon radish extracts at non-toxic concentrations (35, 50 ug/ml) were shown to induce G 2 /M phase cell cycle arrest in CaCo- 2 cells and significantly reduce cell proliferation (over 144 hours) due to cytostatic effects. Thus, it was postulated that anti- cancer effects exerted by BroccoShoots mixture were mainly mediated by activity of Daikon radish extracts. These results demonstrate that sprouts and notably Daikon radish sprouts were effective in inhibiting several stages of colon carcinogenesis in vitro. Also, hypothesis was proposed that lymphocytes could be used as a surrogate biomarker of colonic tissue in assessment of DNA hypermethylation status of genes involved in colon carcinogenesis and that supplementation with folate rich watercress could affect promoter methylation of these genes. However, no detectable levels in promoter methylation ofp 16 INK 4 a, MGMT, CDX- 2 and C-Myc genes were found in lymphocytes from healthy volunteers. Moreover, there was no evidence that watercress consumption could change methylation status of investigated genes. This indicates that lymphocytes may not be a suitable marker for measurement of DNA hypermethylation in the selected genes. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that high input {{cropping}} systems may cause the decay of soil fertility, thus limiting crop yield and soil resilience. Furthermore the typical environmental conditions of Mediterranean area (high temperature coupled with high moisture in autumn and spring periods) usually enhance this trend because of an increased SOM degradation. In this context, Green Manures, especially with legume crops, may represent a useful tool for improving soil fertility also reducing external energy inputs because they allow to increase soil N and P availability for the following crop and at the same time, contribute to the conservation of SOM and soil biological, physical and chemical properties (Mc Vay et al., 1989). On the other side, winter non leguminous crops, thanks to their high C up N ratio could improve C storage in soil, thus resulting also effective in capturing post-harvest soil N, so reducing autumn N leaching (Upendra, 2007). A mixture of legume and non legume cover crops could be more suitable to both increase organic matter and reduce the potential N leaching. Nevertheless, adequate quantities of C and N are not easy to predict, because biotical (weeds) and a-biotical factors (rainfall and temperature) could limit growth and N-fixing of the crops used for green manuring. This paper shows the results of a two year trial on the effects of different <b>green</b> manure treatments (<b>leguminous,</b> non leguminous and mixtures) on C and N balance and yield of maize. This two year experiment showed that legume crop green manure can give a maize yield not different from mineral fertilization. The application of high quality organic input such as Vetch (with low lignin/N and C/N ratio) could provide a more efficient use of nutrients by releasing N quickly for food crops. Green manuring made with mixed crops and pure oat cause a significant reduction in yield of the following crops, because of lack in available N due to high C/N ratio of biomass. Nevertheless application of lower quality plant residues (high in lignin and low in N), such as oat, may maintain or increase SOC, and build-up soil organic N in the slowly turning pool (Sanchez, 1989), but only additional N fertilization can make this tool sustainable for farm economics. High N surplus at harvest was assessed for all treatments including C, showing that nitrate leaching and ground water pollution could involve organic farming too. Growing winter N catch crops between the summer crops may be one way to reduce this problem. Those crops can uptake the residual inorganic N present in soils {{at the end of the}} summer growing season as well as that, which will be mineralized during the following winter period, till the beginning of the next summer season (Rodrigues, 2001). Furthermore extreme variability in biomass and N supplies with green manure suggest to integrate this tool with other techniques of soil fertility management...|$|R
40|$|I was {{encouraged}} to read Dr. Longo and colleagues' Letter to the Editor entitled "The best athletes in ancient Rome were vegetarian!"(Longo et al., 2008). These writers ask that we rethink {{the issue of what}} is an optimal dietary protein content for athletes by considering the diets that sustained the ancient gladiators of Rome. Historical evidence shows that humans of ancient times performed at intense levels while consuming 78 % of their diets' as plant protein (Kanz and Grosschmidt, 2007). This anthropological fact, and some recent laboratory evidence, argues against the need to increase the protein RDA for athletes from 0. 8 g of protein per kilogram of body weight per day to 1. 2 to 1. 4 g per kilogram per day (ACSM, 2000). Our research group found that amino acids make a small contribution (2 - 3 % of total) to endurance energy needs (Lamont et al, 1999) and that athlete's have similar oxidation rates if corrections are made for oxygen consumption and fat-free body mass. Others report that a short-term training program of 38 -days reduces amino acid use during exercise and down-regulates a critical enzyme in the oxidative pathway in order to spare this nutrient (McKenzie et al., 2000) Yet sport nutritionists and physiologists continue to recommend an increased protein RDA for this group. If one does a Google search using the words exercise and protein you would literally get millions of citations recommending the athlete to increase their protein intake. One reason for this continued recommendation, I believe, is that the laboratory procedure used to justify an increased protein RDA (field-based nitrogen balance measurements) has many methodological shortcomings that are not recognized by the sports science community (Lamont, 2008). The problems with this technique are so great that its scientific fidelity has been questioned (Lamont, 2008). And as Longo and colleagues have highlighted (2008) the Institute of Medicine concluded that the evidence for increasing the RDA in active individuals is not compelling (Washington, 2002). All of these facts speak to the argument that many have "jumped the gun" in recommending that athlete's increase their protein intake. The ancient (and modern) evidence indicates that we need to recalibrate our dietary protein recommendations for this group. This argument is compelling when we consider that protein and amino acid supplements are among the highest nutritional supplements consumed (Lawrence and Kirby, 2002) We appreciate Dr. Lamont's comments on the need to recalibrate dietary protein recommendations for athletes. Protein requirements for experienced athletes {{have been the subject of}} a long and ongoing scientific debate. For strength-trained individuals to maintain a positive nitrogen balance, it is suggested that they need to consume a protein intake of 1. 6 to 1. 8 g·kg- 1 ·day- 1 (American Dietetic Association et al., 2000). Half of American collegiate athletes use nutritional supplements, with protein supplementation being one of the most commonly used (Schenk and Costley, 2002). High protein intake in daily diet using protein supplementation is widely used to gain muscle mass and strength among athletes and coaches. It is commonly believed that high intensity training increases protein requirements. The concept that if more proteins are available to the exercising muscle, greater protein muscular synthesis occurs is diffuse in recreational and competitive athletes. This so widely accepted belief of protein supplementation and consequently high protein intake increases sport performances does not seem to be supported by scientific data. Sport magazines are full of articles in which the authors explains how to made the highest amount of protein and in the same pages we can find out protein supplementation sponsors and pictures of "hardcore" bodybuilders. We can therefore speculate about the origin of the huge diffusion of the "protein supplementation culture": it is possible that behind it there are just the economic interests of commercial producers, but other reasons are also possible. Protein supplementation indeed could be 'psychological doping' for athletes, so that this could be the fertile soil on which protein supplementation business may grow up. We should admit that the ability to achieve adequate protein intake for many collegiate athletes is compromised from inadequate nutrition attributed to low caloric intake, poor food choices, and irregular meals (Cole, 2005; Hinton, 2004), and this could be another reason why these athletes have to rely on protein supplementation to ingest their daily requirement of proteins. Studies examining the effect of protein supplementation on strength enhancement are limited and results have been inconclusive. Although some investigators have shown augmented strength gains from protein supplementation (Bird et al., 2006), others have reported no effects (Chromiak et al., 2004; Rankin et al., 2004). However, these studies have generally used untrained or recreationally trained individuals. A recent study (Hoffman, 2007) evaluates the effect of protein supplementation on athletic performance and hormonal changes in 21 experienced collegiate strength/power athletes participating in a 12 -week resistance training program. Although protein supplementation appeared to augment lower body strength development, similar upper body strength, anaerobic power and lean tissue changes do not provide clear evidence in supporting the efficacy of a 12 -week protein supplementation period in experienced resistance trained athletes. Kraemer et al., 1998 reported no differences in training volume or intensity in experienced resistance-trained men during several days of protein supplementation. In 2001, the American Heart Association published a statement on dietary protein and weight reduction and suggested that individuals following such a diet may be at potential risk for metabolic, cardiac, renal, bone and liver diseases (St. Jeor et al., 2001). Charles Darwin remarked: "The most extraordinary workers I ever saw, the labourers in the mines of Chile, live exclusively on vegetable food, including many seeds of <b>leguminous</b> plants. " <b>Vegetable</b> proteins, when combined to provide for all of the essential amino acids, provide an excellent source for protein, considering that they will likely result in a reduction in the intake of saturated fat and cholesterol. Vegetable sources of protein also provide numerous other nutrients such as phytochemicals and fiber that are also highly regarded in the diet (Hoffman, 2004) Considering the paucity of studies examining protein supplementation in experienced athletes for long period of time, further studies are warranted to examine the optimal protein intake for the health of athletes, and to ameliorate sport performance. Finally, we can consider that, for the modern sportsman, the hunger for gaining "hardcore" muscles becomes as pointless as it would have been for a Roman legionnaire or for a gladiato...|$|R
