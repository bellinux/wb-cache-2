With a scanning near-field optical microscope, fluorescence images of a Langmuir-Blodgett film of diethylene glycol diamine pentacosadiynoic amide are obtained with a lateral resolution of 100 nm.

Therefore {{it is possible to}} correlate a high-resolution <b>fluorescence</b> <b>micrograph</b> with the topological structure of the polymer film.

40|$|Fluorescence micrographs are {{acquired}} for {{the quantitative}} evaluation {{of different types}} of cell experiments within the fields of e. g. virology, micro-biology, or immunology. Life-scientists either assess and evaluate these micrographs manually or automated with adequate software tools. Nevertheless, the usage and parameterization of these image processing and analysis methods is a challenging task, which is often infeasible for life scientists with no or little image processing or computer science knowledge. In order to bridge the so-called “semantic gap” between high level and complex to parameterize image processing methods and their life scientist user, we propose the use of the wizard interaction pattern. In this contribution, we will review existing wizard approaches and guidelines for interactive <b>fluorescence</b> <b>micrograph</b> segmentation and derive a practical concept for a cell segmentation wizard, using active contours and active shape models as one high level segmentation approach.

40|$|A 10 -mm-long {{cylindrical}} shell {{was written in}} neodymium doped phosphate glass by a femtosecond laser delivering pulses with a pulse repetition of 1 kHz, energies of 90 uJ and duration of 120 fs. The pulses were focused below the glass surface by an objective producing ablation filaments about 200 um in length. During processing, the sample was placed on a three-dimensional (3 -D) translation stage, which moved along an enclosed pattern in the horizontal plane followed by a minor descent less than the filament length in the vertical direction. As this procedure continued, a cylinder, which demonstrated optical waveguiding, was fabricated with a rarified periphery and densified center region due to plasmonic expansion and outward shockwave upon laser ablation. The refractive-index contrast, propagation loss, near-and far-field mode distribution, and microscopic <b>fluorescence</b> <b>micrograph</b> of the waveguides were measured. 1 -to-N splitters with adjustable splitting ratio were also fabricated using current approach indicating its 3 -D processing flexibility.

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of free software tools have been made available {{for the evaluation of}} fluorescence cell micrographs. The main users are biologists and related life scientists with no or little knowledge of image processing. In this review, we give an overview of available tools and guidelines about which tools the users should use to segment fluorescence micrographs. We selected 15 free tools and divided them into stand-alone, Matlab-based, ImageJ-based, free demo versions of commercial tools and data sharing tools. The review consists of two parts: First, we developed a criteria catalogue and rated the tools regarding structural requirements, functionality (flexibility, segmentation and image processing filters) and usability (documentation, data management, usability and visualization). Second, we performed an image processing case study with four representative <b>fluorescence</b> <b>micrograph</b> segmentation tasks with figure-ground and cell separation. The tools display a wide range of functionality and usability. In the image processing case study, we were able to perform figure-ground separation in all micrographs using mainly thresholding. Cell separation was not possible with most of the tools, because cell separation methods are provided only by a subset of the tools and are difficult to parametrize and to use. Most important is that the usability matches the functionality of a tool. To be usable, specialized tools with less functionality need to fulfill less usability criteria, whereas multipurpose tools need a well-structured menu and intuitive graphical user interface...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{automation}} in fluorescence microscopy has strongly increased, particularly {{in regards to}} image acquisition and sample preparation, which results in a huge volume of data. The amount of time required for manual assessment of an experiment is hence mainly determined {{by the amount of}} time required for data analysis. In addition, manual data analysis is often a task with poor reproducibility and lack of objectivity. Using automated image analysis software, the time required for data analysis can be reduced while quality and reproducibility of the evaluation are improved. Most image analysis approaches are based on a segmentation of the image. By arranging several image processing methods in a so-called segmentation pipeline, and by adjusting all parameters, a broad range of fluorescence image data can be segmented. The drawback of available software tools is the long time required to calibrate the segmentation pipeline for an experiment, particularly for researchers with little knowledge of image processing. As a result, many experiments that could benefit from automated image analysis are still evaluated manually. In order {{to reduce the amount of}} time users have to spend in adapting automated image analysis software to their data, research was carried out on a novel image analysis concept based on hand-labeled data. Using this concept, the user is required to provide hand-labeled cells, based on which an efficient combination of image processing methods and their parameterization is automatically calibrated, without further user input. The development of a segmentation pipeline that allows high-quality segmentation of a broad range of fluorescence micrographs in short time poses a challenge. In this work, a three-stage segmentation pipeline consisting of exchangeable preprocessing, figure-ground separation and cell-splitting methods was developed. These methods are mainly based on the state of the art, whereas some of them represent contributions to this status. Discretization of parameters must be performed carefully, as a broad range of fluorescence image data shall be supported. In order to allow calibration of the segmentation pipeline in a short time, discretization with equidistant as well as nonlinear step sizes was implemented. Apart from parameter discretization, quality of the calibration strongly depends on choice of the parameter optimization technique. In order to reduce calibration runtime, exploratory parameter space analysis was performed for different segmentation methods. This experiment showed that parameter spaces are mostly monotonous, but also show several local performance maxima. The comparison of different parameter optimization techniques indicated that the coordinate descent method results in a good parameterization of the segmentation pipeline in a small amount of time. In order to minimize the amount of time spent by the user in calibration of the system, correlation between the number of hand-labeled reference samples and the resulting segmentation performance was investigated. This experiment demonstrates that as few as ten reference samples often result in a good parameterization of the segmentation pipeline. Due to the low number of cells required for automatic calibration of the segmentation pipeline, as well as its short runtime, it can be concluded that the investigated method improves automation and efficiency in <b>fluorescence</b> <b>micrograph</b> analysis. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{automatic}} {{subcellular localisation}} of proteins in living cells {{is a critical}} step in determining their function. The evaluation of fluorescence images constitutes a common method of localising these proteins.

In an automated system, it is advantageous to recognise these cells in bright-field microscope images taken in parallel with the regarded <b>fluorescence</b> <b>micrographs.</b> Unfortu-nately, currently available cell recognition methods are only of limited use within the context of protein localisation, since they frequently re-quire microscopy techniques that enable images of higher contrast (e. g. phase contrast microscopy or additional dyes) or can only be employed with too low magnifications. Therefore, this article introduces a novel approach to the robust automatic recognition of unstained living cells in bright-field microscope images.

40|$|We {{identified}} a fluorophore, 1 -aminoanthracene (1 -AMA), that is anesthetic, potentiates GABAergic transmission, and gives an appropriate dissociation constant, Kd ≈ 0. 1 mM, for binding {{to the general}} anesthetic site in horse spleen apoferritin (HSAF). 1 -AMA fluorescence is enhanced when bound to HSAF. Thus, displacement of 1 -AMA from HSAF by other anesthetics attenuates the fluorescence signal and allows determination of Kd, as validated by isothermal titration calorimetry. This provides a unique fluorescence assay for compound screening and anesthetic discovery. Additional electrophysiology experiments in isolated cells indicate that 1 -AMA potentiates chloride currents elicited by GABA, similar to many general anesthetics. Furthermore, 1 -AMA reversibly immobilizes stage 45 – 50 Xenopus laevis tadpoles (EC 50 = 16 μM) and <b>fluorescence</b> <b>micrographs</b> show 1 -AMA localized to brain and olfactory regions.
