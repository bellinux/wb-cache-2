You're in a position to <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> do something that they really want to do, and it was not something that would hurt me or damage me—why not? All the dreams you show up in are not your own.|$|E
500|$|Even {{though she}} coldly tyrannizes {{virtually}} everyone around her, she is sometimes hurt and confused over being disliked. [...] She admits, [...] "It's lonely on the bench. I thought I'd like {{a place where}} people can't get to you but once in a while..." [...] A colleague completes her thought: [...] "you need to <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> who can get to you." ...|$|E
500|$|While Temperton {{was writing}} [...] "Thriller" [...] {{he stated that}} he'd [...] "always envisioned" [...] a [...] "talking section at the end" [...] on the song, but did not really know what [...] "to do with it", until {{deciding}} [...] "to <b>have</b> <b>somebody,</b> a famous voice, in the horror genre, to do this vocal." [...] Jones' then-wife, Peggy Lipton, who knew Vincent Price, suggested Price for the vocal part, which Price agreed to do.|$|E

500|$|We {{found both}} {{her and her}} crew {{to be easy to}} work with and low-key. I think we would have {{expected}} a lot of drama, and the truth is, she is probably the most down-to-earth person. It was endearing. She was friendly and kind. ... I think, for us, we're so excited to have someone of her talent, and to <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> like that shoot here is a sheer honor. What her music does for music is so much more than entertainment. It's connecting to the arts on a much deeper level, and that's what I hope we can do here." ...|$|E
500|$|Instead {{of using}} the human {{characters}} in the show's cast, the writers and producers decided to use Muppets to present their narrative {{about the effects of}} divorce on young children. They chose to use the family of Mr. Snuffleupagus ("Snuffy"), a large Muppet that had been on the show since 1971. Long-time cast member Bob McGrath stated, [...] "They knew they couldn't do it with either of our married couples—Gordon and Susan or Maria and Luis—so they tried it with Snuffleupagus, writing a show about his parents getting divorced". According to Simon, [...] "With puppets, it's slightly less frightening... The kids <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> to identify with. They see the puppet characters have feelings and work through a difficult issue many of them will have to face".|$|E
500|$|Some {{songs were}} from McCartney's childhood, {{in which his}} father, Jim, would often be playing on the family piano. Most of the songs were played based on the sheet music, as LiPuma said that [...] "We'd <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> write out a chord sheet for us, {{and then we went}} in and figured it out on the date". LiPuma also said McCartney wasn't {{unfamiliar}} with the group's way of recording, saying that McCartney said [...] "I love this. It reminds me of the way we used to do the Beatles. John [...] and I would write a song, we'd have a date booked at Abbey Road, and neither George Martin, George Harrison or Ringo [...] knew what the songs were about. They'd work it out right there in the room".|$|E

500|$|During oral arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts {{noted that}} the case was a [...] "very {{familiar}} situation of an apprentice who is both an employee and a student," [...] {{and that the only}} way that one could draw a line between the two [...] "is to <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> say: This {{is going to be the}} line." [...] He was of the opinion that if anyone should draw the line, the Internal Revenue Service should be the one. Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor, on the other hand, felt that residents were employees, as evidenced by her statement [...] "You don't think receiving $50,000 or $60,000 a year is enough to make you an employee of someone?" [...] According to The Wall Street Journal, Associate Justice Samuel Alito appeared to be more favorable to the medical schools, asking the Justice Department's lawyer at one point [...] "in general, why do medical students become residents? Are they enrolled in the program to make money...or do they want additional education?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "S" [...] {{was written}} by Ester Dean in {{collaboration}} with the song's producers, Stargate and Sandy Vee. Dean explained its conception and the sexually suggestive lyrics to Gail Mitchell of Billboard: [...] "The first thing that came to me was 'Come on, come on.' I'm thinking, 'I don't know what in the hell this is about to be.' And I remembered I'd seen something that said, 'Sticks and stones may break my bones.' Then came 'But chains and whips excite me.' When people have a great track that speaks to me, it feels like it already has a story in it". Rihanna told Rolling Stone about her interest in bondage and other sadomasochism activities, themes central to [...] "S": [...] "I like to take charge, but I love to be submissive... being submissive in the bedroom is really fun. You get to be a little lady, to <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> be macho and in charge." ...|$|E
500|$|Staff writer Tracy Tormé was {{not pleased}} with the [...] "1940s tribal Africa" [...] theme of the aliens, and because the combat scene {{towards the end of}} the episode resembled the Kirk versus Spock fight in [...] episode [...] "Amok Time". Fellow Star Trek writer Maurice Hurley said that it was [...] "a good idea, but the {{execution}} just fell apart. Again, if you take that script and if the actors had been told to give it a different twist, that show would have been different. But it became too baroque and fell apart. But the concept of having a guy say 'I have to <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> kill my wife and this is the person' is a good idea." [...] Some of the cast, including Jonathan Frakes, sought to prevent the episode from being re-aired. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly in 2012, Patrick Stewart agreed with fans that considered the season 2 episode [...] "" [...] to be [...] "the first truly great episode of the series", stating that the first season [...] "had several quite weak episodes"; referring to [...] "Code of Honor" [...] in particular he said, [...] "I can think of one very early on that involved a race of black aliens that we all felt quite embarrassed about." ...|$|E

500|$|Citizen Kane was {{edited by}} Robert Wise and {{assistant}} editor Mark Robson. Both would become successful film directors. Wise was hired after Welles finished shooting the [...] "camera tests" [...] and began officially making the film. Wise said that Welles [...] "had an older editor assigned {{to him for}} those tests and evidently he was not too happy and asked to <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> else. I was roughly Orson's age and had several good credits." [...] Wise and Robson began editing the film {{while it was still}} shooting and said that they [...] "could tell certainly that we were getting something very special. It was outstanding film day in and day out." [...] Welles gave Wise detailed instructions and was usually not present during the film's editing. The film was very well planned out and intentionally shot for such post-production techniques as slow dissolves. The lack of coverage made editing easy since Welles and Toland edited the film [...] "in camera" [...] by leaving few options of how it could be put together. Wise said the breakfast table sequence took weeks to edit and get the correct [...] "timing" [...] and [...] "rhythm" [...] for the whip pans and over-lapping dialogue. The News on the March sequence was edited by RKO's newsreel division to give it authenticity. They used stock footage from Pathé News and the General Film Library.|$|E
500|$|Sullivan Stapleton plays Damien Scott, {{a former}} United States Delta Force {{operator}} who {{is familiar with}} the antagonists of the second series, and an acquaintance of John Porter. He is recruited by Section 20 to help Sergeant Michael Stonebridge find and rescue the kidnapped Porter. Stapleton describes Scott as cocky, rebellious and arrogant, and that it was good to <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> like him in Section 20 because [...] "he is the one that usually goes in first and takes the bullets, whereas Stonebridge arrives at the last minute and saves the day." [...] The actor opined that Scott is chosen for the dangerous role because he is daring and does not have any immediate family members who rely on him. Of Scott and Stonebridge's working relationship, Stapleton said [...] "they have a professional respect for each other" [...] but start to annoy each other. When the actor first read the script for Project Dawn, he saw himself for the role as Scott. Because Stapleton is an Australian actor, he had to speak with an American accent throughout the series. He was wary whether he did it right because he barely worked with Americans on the show, but believed he did okay when HBO, the network that operated Cinemax, was satisfied with it. Stapleton has signed up for another Strike Back series should it be commissioned.|$|E
500|$|Songs {{from the}} album have been sampled {{frequently}} by hip hop producers and artists, including Black Moon, who sampled [...] "A Divine Image", and DJ Shadow, who sampled the luminous piano line from [...] "The Human Abstract" [...] on his 1996 song [...] "Midnight in a Perfect World". English hip hop producer Metabeats called Songs of Experience {{one of his}} favorite sources for sampling music and said of the album in an interview for Hip Hop Connection: [...] "You could sample everything on this record, and I think everyone already has. Axelrod is pretty much a sound library in himself – the quality is amazing." [...] American musician John McEntire ranked it third on his list of top-five albums and called it [...] "early crate-digger stuff. Great, funky rhythm-section playing, crazy, overblown string arrangements." [...] In a 2000 interview for The Wire, rapper and producer Mike Ladd spoke of the album recording [...] "London", deeming it [...] "crazy stuff" [...] that deviated from the one-dimensional rhythm loops of contemporary hip hop production. He went on the say, [...] "this is definitely the kind of stuff I'm planning to do for the next album, incorporate more fusion elements and stuff like that. This is a really good production. I like it because it's little parts with gaps, which I don't normally <b>have.</b> <b>Somebody</b> told me I should listen to [...] This is one I'm definitely going to buy I'd like to do more stuff with complicated melodies, everybody playing together, drum breaks, things like that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a relief," [...] remarked Adam, who {{had struck}} a match and studied his watch. [...] "The ground's clear and Don Hernando <b>has</b> <b>somebody</b> he can trust {{waiting at the}} lagoon. You can let her go ahead, Captain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{are very}} good,' replied Nicholas hastily; 'but I think {{perhaps it would}} be better if I <b>had</b> <b>somebody</b> of my own size at first, in case I should turn out awkward. I should feel more at home, perhaps.' ...|$|R

500|$|A billionaire socialite who dedicates {{himself to}} {{protecting}} Gotham City from its criminal underworld as a bat-masked vigilante who is hailed as its [...] "Dark Knight" [...] at night. Bale {{said he was}} confident in his choice to return in the role because of the positive response to his portrayal in Batman Begins. He continued training in the Keysi Fighting Method and performed many of his own stunts, but did not gain as much muscle {{as in the previous}} film because the new Batsuit allowed him to move with greater agility. Bale described Batman's dilemma as whether [...] " [...] something that has an end. Can he quit and have an ordinary life? The kind of manic intensity someone has to have to maintain the passion and the anger that they felt as a child, takes an effort after a while, to keep doing that. At some point, you have to exorcise your demons." [...] He added, [...] "Now you have not just a young man in pain attempting to find some kind of an answer, you <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> who actually has power, who is burdened by that power, and is having to recognize the difference between attaining that power and holding on to it." [...] Bale felt Batman's personality had been strongly established in the first film, so it was unlikely his character would be overshadowed by the villains, stating: [...] "I have no problem with competing with someone else. And that's going to make a better movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Stipe {{later called}} chorus lyrics of [...] "Sitting Still" [...] from R.E.M. debut album, Murmur, [...] "nonsense", {{saying in a}} 1994 online chat, [...] "You all know there aren't words, per se, {{to a lot of}} the early stuff. I can't even {{remember}} them." [...] In truth, Stipe carefully crafted the lyrics to many early R.E.M. songs. Stipe explained in 1984 that when he started writing lyrics they were like [...] "simple pictures", but after a year he grew tired of the approach and [...] "started experimenting with lyrics that didn't make exact linear sense, and it's just gone from there." [...] In the mid-1980s, as Stipe's pronunciation while singing became clearer, the band decided that its lyrics should convey ideas on a more literal level. Mills explained, [...] "After you've made three records and you've written several songs and they've gotten better and better lyrically the next step would be to <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> question you and say, are you saying anything? And Michael had the confidence at that point to say yes [...] [...] [...]" [...] Songs like [...] "Cuyahoga" [...] and [...] "Fall on Me" [...] on Lifes Rich Pageant dealt with such concerns as pollution. Stipe incorporated more politically oriented concerns into his lyrics on Document and Green. [...] "Our political activism and the content of the songs was just a reaction to where we were, and what we were surrounded by, which was just abject horror," [...] Stipe said later. [...] "In 1987 and '88 there was nothing to do but be active." [...] Stipe has since explored other lyrical topics. Automatic for the People dealt with [...] "mortality and dying. Pretty turgid stuff", according to Stipe, while Monster critiqued love and mass culture.|$|E
500|$|Bosh has {{traditionally}} played the power forward position, including {{during his first}} season with the Miami Heat. However, starting in the 2011–12 season, he began to start at center and played the position during the team's consecutive championships. Listed at 6ft 11in (2.11m) and 235pounds (107kg), Bosh possesses excellent speed, athleticism, and ball handling for a player of his size. He is particularly noted {{for his ability to}} drive to the basket and finish strong or get to the free throw line—where he is also proficient—but he is also known for his well-developed jump shot. Indiana Pacers coach Jim O'Brien once commented on the match-up problems Bosh posed for opposing defenders: [...] "We've tried over the years to put big guys on him. It doesn't work. We've tried to put small guys on him. It doesn't seem to work either. I don't know if we <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> to play Bosh, to tell you the truth." [...] When he was the centerpiece of the Raptors' offense, Bosh was often double teamed, and he was noted to unselfishly pass the ball to teammates who were in better shooting positions. He improved his shooting range when he worked on his three-point shooting during the summer of 2006 and showed improvement in the 2006–07 season. On November 8, 2006, against the Philadelphia 76ers, he hit a game-winning three-point shot with 6.1 seconds left. It was reminiscent of the shot that marked his [...] "arrival" [...] to the NBA in his first season, when he hit a game-tying three-pointer against Houston to send the game to overtime. When the 2006–07 season concluded, Bosh had shot [...]343 from the three point arc for the season; he improved to [...]400 the following season. Despite his ability to hit three-pointers, it was during his tenure with the Miami Heat that he began to be relied upon as one of the team's outside shooters, taking multiple three-pointers throughout the 2012 and 2013 championship runs. During the 2013–14 season, Bosh shot and made more three-pointers than at any point during his career, and continued to make crucial shots during the playoffs.|$|E

2500|$|The Chernobyl {{disaster}} {{occurred at}} the same time that the cast and crew were filming scenes in Ukraine, forcing them to evacuate the area and postpone shooting for a month. In a 2008 Details interview, Christian Bale briefly recalled their evacuation and subsequent return: [...] "We knew something had occurred, because production came to us and they said, 'We're done. We have to leave.' A month later we were back. We would <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> with a Geiger counter at every dinner, scanning each plate".|$|E
2500|$|To replace Jenna, Nation created Dayna Mellanby, {{a skilled}} combat expert partly {{based on the}} {{character}} of Miranda from Shakespeare's play The Tempest.

Josette Simon was chosen to play Dayna; Simon had recently graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and did not have an Equity card.|$|E
