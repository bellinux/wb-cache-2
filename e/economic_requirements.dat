Additionally, and most importantly, our approach also leads to analytically tractable expressions of multi-LIBOR payoffs. This approach unifies therefore the advantages of well-known forward price models with those of classical LIBOR rate models. Several examples are added and prototypical volatility smiles are shown. We believe that the CIR-process based LIBOR model might be of particular interest for applications, since closed form valuation formulas for caps and swaptions are derived. ...|$|R

We propose two alternative economic capital quantification approaches, firstly for individual defined benefit pension schemes on a stand-alone basis and then for the pension sector as a whole by quantifying economic capital of the UK’s Pension Protection Fund, which takes over eligible schemes with deficit, in the event of sponsor insolvency. We find that <b>economic</b> capital <b>requirements</b> for individual schemes are significantly high.

40|$|Solvency-both as an <b>economic</b> <b>requirement</b> in {{the market}} and as a {{regulatory}} and supervisory tool-is critical to all insurance markets. Current market conditions, coupled with expected institutional changes, will place particular burdens on emerging and developing markets. Institutional solvency, effective risk management within companies, effective supervisory oversight, and the development of market disciplines are all linked. The author proposes that the effective implementation of the emerging regime needs a careful and diligent phased process of capacity-building. The first priorities are identified as a strong supervisor, a basic solvency margin requirement, and the initiation of efforts to gather appropriate data sets. This can be followed by advancing development of more sophisticated solvency regulation, increased use of technical expertise, and increased use of market disciplines as the community and financial markets become more able to exercise such discipline.

In this way Rubanisation ensures that every person or family is able to enjoy a high quality of life, with a choice of lifestyle, livelihood and location.
