5|$|The I-35W Mississippi River bridge (officially {{known as}} Bridge 9340) was an eight-lane, steel truss arch bridge that carried Interstate 35W across the Saint Anthony Falls of the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. During the evening rush hour on August 1, 2007, it {{suddenly}} collapsed, killing 13 people and injuring 145. The bridge was Minnesota's third busiest, carrying 140,000 vehicles daily. The NTSB cited a design flaw as the likely {{cause of the}} collapse, noting that a too-thin <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> ripped along a line of rivets, and asserted that additional weight on the bridge {{at the time of}} the collapse contributed to the catastrophic failure.|$|E
50|$|A KT <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> connects {{several members}} {{together}} through one <b>gusset</b> <b>plate.</b> The <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> is welded to a beam {{and then two}} or three columns, beams, or truss chord are connect {{to the other side}} of the <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> through bolts or welds.|$|E
50|$|Gusset {{plates are}} {{therefore}} used in most metal weight bearing structures, but {{the material and}} size of the <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> varies based on the structure. Bridges usually require thick sheets of steel for their gusset plates, but trusses sometimes only require small sheets of aluminium for their <b>gusset</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} prominent connection types that include <b>gusset</b> <b>plates</b> which include KT <b>gusset</b> <b>plates,</b> uniform force bracing connections, and bolt groups.|$|R
50|$|The {{most notable}} bridge failure due to <b>gusset</b> <b>plates</b> is the {{collapse}} of I-35W Mississippi River bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota on August 1, 2007. Investigators found that the bridge had 16 under-designed <b>gusset</b> <b>plates</b> that all fractured and ripped like paper, and that the remaining <b>gusset</b> <b>plates</b> were properly designed and remained intact.|$|R
50|$|Occasionally <b>gusset</b> <b>plates</b> will be {{made from}} copper or aluminum, but only with small {{structures}} {{that do not require}} much support. The copper and aluminum <b>gusset</b> <b>plates</b> also provide a more attractive finish for exposed structures.|$|R
50|$|The {{size and}} {{strength}} of the <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> depends on size and {{the function of the}} structure. The larger the force on the connecting members, the larger the size of the <b>gusset</b> <b>plate.</b> Gusset plates provide an easy way to retrofit structures that can no longer safely support the applied loads.|$|E

50|$|The {{bridge was}} widened and the {{substructure}} was strengthened between 1992 and 1993 to accommodate hard shoulders. The Blatnik Bridge {{was reduced to}} two lanes temporarily in 2008, after it was discovered in a bridge inspection that the 1990s upgrades to the Blatnik Bridge had added weight beyond the load limit for <b>gusset</b> <b>plates</b> in eight different locations. This {{was similar to the}} <b>gusset</b> <b>plates</b> that caused the I-35W Bridge in Minneapolis to collapse on August 1, 2007. The Blatnik Bridge was reduced to two lanes temporarily until the <b>gusset</b> <b>plates</b> could be strengthened.|$|R

50|$|Gusset {{plates are}} usually either made from cold rolled or {{galvanized}} steel {{based upon their}} use. Galvanized steel offers more protection from rust, so this is usually used when the <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> is exposed to the elements. The <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> is usually painted to match nearby steel and fixtures and to give it an extra layer of protection.|$|E
50|$|Gusset plates can be {{made into}} a variety of shapes and sizes and from a range of materials.

50|$|On August 1, 2007, the I-35W Mississippi River Bridge {{collapsed}} during afternoon rush hour, {{resulting in}} the deaths of 13 people.

"December 2012 "[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] A significant challenge in determining the safety margin for <b>gusset</b> <b>plates</b> is determining the level of stresses carried in the plate. Present technologies are unable to evaluate the dead, live and residual stresses maintained in <b>gusset</b> <b>plates.</b> The goal of the research presented in this thesis is to improve the safety of highway bridges by developing and testing an ultrasonic stress measurement methodology for determining actual stress in steel <b>gusset</b> <b>plates,</b> evaluating the accuracy and precision of the measurements, and assess if the methodology has sufficient accuracy and precision to be a useful tool in the safety analysis of <b>gusset</b> <b>plates.</b> This research utilizes the acoustoelastic effect to evaluate actual stress levels by assessing the acoustic birefringence in a steel material. The birefringence measurement evaluates normalized variations of polarized shear waves propagating through the plate thickness, which vary proportionally as a function of stress.
