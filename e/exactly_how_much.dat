However, in Final Fantasy Tactics, random battles only occur in pre-set locations, marked in green on the world map. Passing over one of these spots may result in a random encounter. Another major aspect of battles is magical attacks. Certain magical attacks cause area of effect damage, and many of the more powerful magical attacks require several turns of charging.

5|$|Between the Humber and Forth the English {{had formed}} into two main kingdoms, Deira and Bernicia, often united as the Kingdom of Northumbria. A number of Celtic kingdoms also existed in this region, {{including}} Craven, Elmet, Rheged, and Gododdin. A native British kingdom, later called the Kingdom of Strathclyde, survived {{as an independent}} power into the 10th century in the area which became modern-day Dunbartonshire and Clydesdale. To the north-west of Strathclyde lay the Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata, and to the north-east {{a small number of}} Pictish kingdoms. Further north still lay the great Pictish kingdom of Fortriu, which after the Battle of Dun Nechtain in 685 came to be the strongest power in the northern half of Britain. The Irish had always had contacts {{with the rest of the}} British Isles, and during the early 6th century they immigrated from the island of Ireland to form the kingdom of Dál Riata, although <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> conquest took place is a matter of dispute with historians.

5|$|In {{the closing}} {{stages of the}} battle, the aged Howe retired to his cabin and Curtis was given {{responsibility}} for the flagship and consequently the fleet over the next day. <b>Exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of what transpired was Curtis's fault has never been established, but {{in a series of}} unusual decisions the British failed to pursue the defeated French fleet, allowing many battered French ships to escape. Even more controversially, a despatch was sent to the Admiralty concerning the action which praised certain officers and excluded others. The awards presented to the captains who had served at the battle were given based on the praise each captain received in this report, and those omitted were excluded from the medal celebrating the victory and other honours. Although Howe had ultimate responsibility for the despatch, many blamed Curtis for this slight and he was rumoured to have taken the decision to abandon pursuit and subsequently penned the report himself in Howe's name.|$|E
5|$|Work {{began on}} Kirby Muxloe Castle in October 1480, under the {{direction}} of Roger Bowlott, who was Lord Hasting's steward and became the clerk of works for the project. Most of the existing manor house was protected during the work, and probably continued in use while the new castle was built around it. A workshop able to make up to 100,000 bricks a week was constructed by Antony Yzebrond from Flanders. A brook was redirected to feed the new moat and a garden was established alongside the castle. Work intensified in early 1481, with the stonework being supervised by John Cowper, a master mason. The work progressed at speed and, at peak periods, over 40 men were working on the site. It is uncertain <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of the castle was constructed, although at least one corner tower had been nearly completed by 1483 and the ground floor of the gatehouse laid down.|$|E

Evidence as {{explored}} by Roosa suggests that Aidit approved of Sjam’s collaboration with military officers in staging a preemptive strike against the army high command. According to the Supardjo document, a reliable piece of testimonial evidence from the era, Sjam was the primary organizer of the movement. However {{it is unclear whether}} Aidit initiated the movement and ordered Sjam to carry it out, or if Aidit allowed Sjam to work with the military officers {{on the assumption that the}} officers were leading the movement. In other words, the main question is whether Aidit was the mastermind of the movement, or was merely a misunderstood supporter of the movement. It is difficult to assess Aidit’s involvement due to a lack of reliable and conclusive evidence. Many historians have investigated the coup, yet even in the case of Roosa, no single analysis has provided a conclusive and undisputed storyline.|$|R

In conditions where it is not <b>exactly</b> known <b>how</b> <b>much</b> the monetary value of the final saw wood varies {{as a function of}} the logging system used, the parametric programming aoproach gives the ranges for those values. If the market value of the saw wood is the same no matter what logging system is used, it is economical to use tree-length harvesting systems under the assumptions of the study. However, if the difference in value is more than 3. 90 /m 3 (* 14. 85 FmJc/m 3) in favor of log-length systems, the tree-length systems are completely replaced by loglength systems in the conditions of Southern Finland. These results cannot be generalized, however, since each sawmill must be regarded as a special case.

The concert attracted immense media attention from across Europe and Australia. They continued the tour through Western Europe, visiting Gothenburg, Copenhagen, Berlin, Cologne, Amsterdam, Antwerp, Essen, Hanover, and Hamburg and ending with shows in the United Kingdom in Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow and two sold-out concerts at London's Royal Albert Hall.

25|$|The term {{water stress}} {{describes}} the physiological states that grapevines experience {{when they are}} deprived of water. When a grapevine goes into water stress one of its first functions {{is to reduce the}} growth of new plant shoots which compete with the grape clusters for nutrients and resources. The lack of water also keeps the individual grape berries down to a smaller size which increase its skin to juice ratio.

While there is disagreement over <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> water stress is beneficial in development grapes for quality wine production, most viticulturist agree that some water stress can be beneficial.

40|$|Johnston, MurrayThe {{goal of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to understand}} the chemistry that governs new particle formation, a ubiquitous and important atmospheric process. New particle formation occurs when gas phase precursors condense to create small molecular clusters {{on the order of}} 1 nm diameter. Those clusters must then grow rapidly and ultimately may serve as the seeds for cloud droplets. However, modelers have substantial difficulty predicting the frequency and efficiency of new particle formation. This predictive difficulty is an important contributor to the uncertainty in aerosol effects on global climate and therefore also contributes to the large uncertainty in anthropogenic effects on climate. To reduce these uncertainties, a more precise understanding of how particles nucleate and grow in the atmospheric is required. In this dissertation, mass spectrometry is used to determine the chemical processes involved in new particle formation. Gas phase species such as sulfuric acid, ammonia, amines, and organic matter are contributors but <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> each contributes to the growth of nanoparticles is not well understood. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) and Nano Aerosol Mass Spectrometry (NAMS) are used to study the chemical composition and reactivity of clusters < 3 nm diameter and nanoparticles 10 - 20 nm diameter, respectively. The FTICR-MS studies are laboratory based, whereas the NAMS studies are field based. Measurements of cluster composition and reactivity using FTICR-MS permit prediction of the composition of ambient molecular clusters. For ambient molecular clusters to become relevant to climate by serving as cloud condensation nuclei, they must grow rapidly. NAMS measurements at 20 nm diameter permit determination of nanoparticle growth pathways. This dissertation shows that sulfuric acid adds to both clusters and nanoparticles in a collision limited manner. On the other hand, ammonia uptake in both size regimes may not necessarily occur at a collision limited rate. Finally, additional nitrogen containing compounds are important to new particle formation in both size regimes, but the molecular form of these species is different for each size regime. Amines are important contributors to the growth of molecular clusters, whereas other organic nitrogen species are important to the growth of nanoparticles.
