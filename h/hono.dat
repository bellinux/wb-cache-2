The connection with <b>Honos</b> would have been obvious to most Romans as demonstrations of virtus led to election to public office and both were considered <b>honos.</b> The cult of <b>Honos</b> was already a long-standing tradition in Rome. The marriage of the two deities ensured that Virtus would also get proper respect from the Romans. But an objection by the pontiffs was that one temple could not properly house two gods because there would be no way of knowing which god to sacrifice to should a miracle happen in the temple.|$|R

Although the first volumes were published on an irregular basis, since volume 7 Viz established a monthly basis due to good sales and consumer demands. Therefore, the following volumes were published until July 5, 2006, when the final volume was released. Yahiko no Sakabatō was also serialized in English Shonen Jump during 2006. In January 2008, Viz began re-releasing the manga in a wideban format called [...] "Viz Big Edition", which {{is a collection of}} three volumes in one. The final volume included the Yahiko no Sakabatō and Haru no Sakura chapters, which take place after the series. Viz uses the actual ordering of Japanese names, with the family name or surname before the given name, within the series to reduce confusion and because Rurouni Kenshin is a historical series. On May 7, 2012, it was announced in Viz Media's digital manga magazine Weekly Shonen Jump Alpha that Rurouni Kenshin Cinema Version would join its line-up under the title Rurouni Kenshin: Restoration, and would be published monthly starting on May 21. Viz Media released the first volume on June 4, 2013, and the second was published on January 14, 2014.
