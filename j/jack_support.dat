50|$|New {{versions}} of <b>JACK</b> <b>support</b> transporting audio over a generic IP network. This {{makes it possible}} to run Ardour on hardware separate from the one that actually contains the audio interface.|$|E
5000|$|This update also {{included}} many small desktop enhancements. Konqueror received tab improvements, an RSS feed viewer sidebar and a searchbar compatible with all keyword searches. KMail was given HTML composition, anti-spam and anti-virus wizards, automatic handling of mailing lists, improved support for cryptography {{and a quick}} search bar. Kopete gained support for file transfers with Jabber, aRts gained <b>jack</b> <b>support</b> and KWin gained new buttons to support more features, such as [...] "always on top".|$|E
50|$|The next day, Howards visits Jack's {{office and}} demands that <b>Jack</b> <b>support</b> the Utility Freezer Bill in {{exchange}} for a Freezer contract. But Jack doesn’t trust Howards, and gets him to admit that his foundation has already discovered an immortality treatment. Howards then agrees to give the same treatment to Jack and Sara, but Jack thinks Howards is still hiding something. He asks {{to know more about the}} treatment, but Howards refuses. In the end, Jack won’t sign, but Howards says he'll give Jack another twenty-four hours to reconsider.|$|E

Venues {{included}} Glasgow Barrowlands Ballroom, Manchester Albert Hall and two nights at London's Hackney Empire (where Wayne joined him to sing harmony).|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of forces on two tree intermediate supports is presented. The analysis is in two parts: The maximum force that the <b>support</b> <b>jack</b> will experience. The movement and forces {{created in the}} two tree support by the skyline and carriage. The maximum force on the <b>support</b> <b>jack</b> occurs when the carriage moves onto the <b>jack.</b> The <b>support</b> line tension varies with changes in skyline geometry and support tree geometry. The equations developed to accomplish the above analysis require iteration {{to arrive at the}} solution. Computer programs developed for the Hewlett Packard 9830 desk top computer are presented. The computer programs solve for the maximum force on the <b>jack,</b> the <b>support</b> <b>jack</b> movement, and the support line tension. Tensions in an experimental multi-span skyline were measured to test assumptions made during the analysis. The assumptions appear to cause the computer programs to overestimate the support line tension. The two-tree analysis was used to analyze two current multi-span problems: Skyline spans that create a horizontal angle in the skyline at the <b>support</b> <b>jack.</b> Maximum <b>support</b> line tensions. The two problems were analyzed by using two hypothetical multi-span skylines and the two-tree support computer programs...|$|R
30|$|A {{hydraulic}} jack of nominal capacity 1500  kN {{was used to}} pullout the IPE sections from the concrete. The <b>jack</b> (<b>support)</b> reaction {{was transferred to the}} concrete at the neighbouring zone of the embedded sections via two plates of dimensions 600  ×  100  mm. The IPE sections were extended 200  mm above the concrete blocks (section A-A, Fig.  6). Also, at the top of each section a load block connected the structural section to the {{hydraulic jack}}. The load blocks were made of steel plates  40  mm thickness and were welded {{to the top of the}} I-sections. There were six stiffeners welded to each structural I-section and the load block. The vertical displacements were recorded on the right and left sides of the load block (Fig.  7).|$|E

30|$|Despite {{the above}} remark, more {{experimental}} work {{is required to}} acquire {{deeper understanding of the}} pullout behaviour of embedded column bases. Tests having <b>jack</b> <b>supports</b> (reactions) far from the ‘pull-out cone’ region of the embedded structural sections would better simulate a static pullout condition in a real column base. Also, more experiments are necessary with varying geometries (and details) of embedded structural sections.|$|R
50|$|The {{controller}} features several output connectors. A stereo headphone <b>jack</b> <b>supports</b> {{the connection}} of regular earphones or a headset to allow a user to speak and hear audio simultaneously. A micro-USB and extension port, {{as well as a}} mono speaker are also included. The controller can be charged three ways: via micro-USB, a dedicated charging station, or the console, even while powered off.|$|R
40|$|The precise {{alignment}} of the 1232 dipoles, 474 Short Straight Sections (SSS) and some other components of the LHC collider, {{requires the use of}} 6800 jacks. The specific requirements and the need for a cost-effective solution for this large production, justified the development and industrialisation of a dedicated mechanical jack. The jack was developed, and is now being produced by Centre for Advanced Technology, India, in the framework of a collaboration between CERN and the Department of Atomic Energy in India. Three <b>jacks</b> <b>support</b> each of the 32 -ton heavy, 15 -meter long cryo-dipole of LHC, and provide the required alignment features. Identical <b>jacks</b> <b>support</b> the lighter LHC Short Straight Sections. Presently, the mass production of 6800 jacks is in progress with two Indian manufacturers, and 3545 jacks have already been delivered to CERN by April 2004. Considering the successful performance of the jacks, it is now envisaged to extend their use, with some modifications, for even higher-demanding {{alignment of}} the low-beta quadrupoles of the LHC...|$|R
50|$|Behind {{the chamber}} {{there is a}} set of {{hydraulic}} <b>jacks</b> <b>supported</b> by the finished part of the tunnel which are used to push the TBM forward. Once a certain distance has been excavated (roughly 1.5-2 meters), a new tunnel ring is built using the erector. The erector is a rotating system which picks up precast concrete segments and places them in the desired position.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{portable}} computers have a combined 3.5 mm TRS-TOSLINK <b>jack,</b> <b>supporting</b> stereo audio output using a TRS connector, or TOSLINK (stereo or 5.1 Dolby Digital/DTS) digital output using a suitable optical adapter. Most iMac computers have this digital/analog combo output feature as standard, with early MacBooks having two ports, one for analog/digital audio input and other for output. Support for input was dropped on various later models ...|$|R

She is helped up, and then <b>Jack</b> <b>supports</b> her out of the woods and back to the circle. Sofia tells them that he name is Valeria Mamentova. She thinks the cause is Vourdulak, a kind of Russian vampire.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} day, Howards visits Jack in his office. They exchange casual {{threats to}} destroy each other, after which Howards requests <b>Jack's</b> <b>support</b> for his Freezer Utility bill in Congress. Jack is insulted by this and refuses, but Howards continues by offering Jack a free Freezer Contract and immortal life. Though tempted, Jack refuses the bribe. Howards gives Jack {{more time to}} think about it, and leaves Jack to consider the offer.|$|R

They bonded, however, when <b>Jack</b> <b>supported</b> Jennifer while she tried to help a jailed mother by fostering her newborn baby. Jack was clearly attracted to her and attempted to throw monkey wrenches in her budding relationship with Emilio Ramirez. Jennifer didnt initially return the romantic interest, but she was intrigued by him and {{spent much of her}} time at work verbally sparring with him. Their banter would eventually become the staple of their relationship.|$|R

500|$|The extratropical storm complex {{incorporating}} {{the remnants of}} Gonzalo generated strong winds across the British Isles, especially over Ireland and the northern United Kingdom. Winds gusted to [...] at Oban in western Scotland, while gusts exceeding 60mph (100km/h) were common elsewhere. The system halted transportation throughout the region, forcing the cancellation of more than 100flights at London Heathrow Airport, grounding ferries, and blocking roads and railways with debris. Falling trees killed one woman near Hyde Park, London, and injured several others. In Essex, the winds collapsed a car <b>jack</b> <b>supporting</b> a van, fatally crushing a man working underneath. The storm triggered minor power outages in Scotland and Wales, with more extensive outages in northwestern Ireland after gusts as high as 70mph (115km/h).|$|R
