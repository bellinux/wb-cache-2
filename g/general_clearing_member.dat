30|$|In the post-crisis world, CCPs {{have assumed}} a {{fundamental}} {{role in the}} financial system. They exist as the agent between two counterparties on opposite sides of a trade, with the purpose of eliminating counterparty risk. The questions their role poses are whether they are themselves a safe counterparty, and whether their size constitutes a significant systemic risk. CCPs’ business is complex to model. Each CCP may have thousands of clients, also called <b>general</b> <b>clearing</b> <b>members</b> (GCMs), and each GCM may deal with multiple CCPs. There are initial margins, variation margins and default fund contributions to be considered. The correlation structure is such that an analytical description of this system is impossible. Studies on CCPs’ efficiency have returned mixed results.|$|R

40|$|A <b>clearing</b> <b>member</b> of a Central Counterparty (CCP) {{is exposed}} to losses on their default fund and initial margin contributions. Such losses can be {{incurred}} whenever the CCP has insufficient funds to unwind the portfolio of a defaulting <b>clearing</b> <b>member.</b> This does not necessarily require the default of the CCP itself. In this note we aim to quantify the risk a financial institution has when facing a CCP. We show that a <b>clearing</b> <b>member’s</b> CCP risk is given by a sum of exposures {{to each of the}} other <b>clearing</b> <b>members.</b> This arises because of the implicit default insurance that each member has provided in the form of mutualised, loss sharing collateral. We calculate the exposures by explicitly modeling the capital structure of a CCP as well as the loss distributions of the individual member portfolios. An important consideration in designing the model is the limited transparency with respect to the portfolio composition and collateral levels of individual <b>clearing</b> <b>members.</b> To overcome this we leverage the fact that, for a typical CCP, margin levels are risk-based. In particular, we parameterise the portfolio loss tail as a Pareto distribution and we calibrate this to the CCP defined probability of losses exceeding the posted initial margin levels. A key aspect of the model is that we explicitly take into account wrong-way risk, i. e. the fact that member defaults are more likely to occur in stressed market conditions, as well as potential contagion between a member’s default and the losses on his portfolio.

40|$|Intraday margin is a {{generally}} accepted risk management tool of central counterparties to cover increased risk exposure during the day. Central counterparties may call for intraday margin {{on a routine}} basis, but also in case of extreme price volatility or large changes in positions of <b>clearing</b> <b>members.</b> An increase {{in the use of}} a routine intraday margin call can be seen at central counterparties in the EU.

In addition, an overview is given of the benefits, cost and side effects of intraday margining to the central counterparty, its <b>clearing</b> <b>members</b> and the capital market in general.

40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{increasing}} {{efforts have been}} put into the development of effective stress tests to quantify the resilience of financial institutions. Here we propose a stress test methodology for central counterparties based on a network characterization of <b>clearing</b> <b>members,</b> whose links correspond to direct credits and debits. This network constitutes the ground for the propagation of financial distress: equity losses caused by an initial shock with both exogenous and endogenous components reverberate within the network and are amplified through credit and liquidity contagion channels. At {{the end of the}} dynamics, we determine the vulnerability of each <b>clearing</b> <b>member,</b> which represents its potential equity loss. We apply the proposed framework to the Fixed Income asset class of CC&G, the central counterparty operating in Italy whose main cleared securities are Italian Government Bonds. We consider two different scenarios: a distributed, plausible initial shock, as well as a shock corresponding to the cover 2 regulatory requirement (the simultaneous default of the two most exposed <b>clearing</b> <b>members).</b> Although the two situations lead to similar results after an unlimited reverberation of shocks on the network, the distress propagation is much more hasty in the latter case, with a large number of additional defaults triggered at early stages of the dynamics. Our results thus show that setting a default fund to cover insolvencies only on a cover 2 basis may not be adequate for taming systemic events, and only very conservative default funds, such as CC&G's one, can face total losses due to the shock propagation. Overall, our network-based stress test represents a refined tool for calibrating default fund amounts...|$|R
