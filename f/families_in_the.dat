5|$|Agriculture is the {{dominant}} source of income in the area surrounding Randolph, especially the cultivation of cotton. Corn, beans and peas were also cultivated during the last century.

Mostly for the cultivation of cotton, land would be used by sharecroppers in return for a share of the crop to the landowner. Modern machines such as the cotton picker have made the manual cultivation obsolete over time as they took over the work from the hand laborers.|$|E

5|$|Discerning {{dynamical}} families {{within the}} Jupiter trojan population {{is more difficult}} {{than it is in}} the asteroid belt, because the Jupiter trojans are locked within a far narrower range of possible positions.

Jupiter-trojan families are much smaller in size than <b>families</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> asteroid belt; the largest identified family, the Menelaus group, consists of only eight members.|$|E

5|$|If two of {{the three}} given circles do not intersect, a center of {{inversion}} can be chosen so that those two given circles become concentric. Under this inversion, the solution circles must fall within the annulus between the two concentric circles. Therefore, they belong to two one-parameter <b>families.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first family (Figure7), the solutions do not enclose the inner concentric circle, but rather revolve like ball bearings in the annulus. In the second family (Figure8), the solution circles enclose the inner concentric circle. There are generally four solutions for each family, yielding eight possible solutions, consistent with the algebraic solution.|$|E
40|$|The Boolean lattice of {{dimension}} two, {{also known}} as the diamond, consists of four distinct elements with the following property: A⊂ B,C⊂ D. A diamond-free <b>family</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> n-dimensional Boolean lattice is a subposet such that no four elements form a diamond. Note that elements B and C {{may or may not be}} related. There is a diamond-free <b>family</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> n-dimensional Boolean lattice of size (2 -o(1)) n n/ 2. In this paper, we prove that any diamond-free <b>family</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> n-dimensional Boolean lattice has size at most (2. 25 +o(1)) n n/ 2. Furthermore, we show that the so-called Lubell function of a diamond-free <b>family</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> n-dimensional Boolean lattice is at most 2. 25 +o(1), which is asymptotically best possible.
