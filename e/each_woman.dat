However, Jessie smells her mother's perfume in Incanto's apartment and calls the police. When they arrive, Incanto is gone, but his computer gives a list of women he has been in contact with.

5|$|Early {{forms of}} {{xylophone}} {{such as the}} atranatrana are found throughout the island and {{are believed to have}} come across with the original Indonesian settlers. The earliest of these is played uniquely by a pair of women, one of whom sits with her legs outstretched together and the bars of the xylophone resting across her legs rather than on a separate resonator box. <b>Each</b> <b>woman</b> strikes the atranatrana with a pair of sticks, one keeping the beat while the second plays a melody. The xylophone bars range from five to seven in number and are made of differing lengths of a rot-resistant wood called hazomalagny. A similar xylophone called katiboky is still played in the southwest among the Vezo and Bara ethnic groups.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{convince}} other slaves in Texas to support the Mexican government over the Texian rebellion, Santa Anna spared Travis' slave, Joe. The day after the battle, he interviewed each noncombatant individually. Impressed with Susanna Dickinson, Santa Anna offered to adopt her infant daughter Angelina and have the child educated in Mexico City. Dickinson refused the offer, which was not extended to Juana Navarro Alsbury although her son was of similar age. <b>Each</b> <b>woman</b> was given a blanket and two silver pesos. Alsbury and the other Tejano women were {{allowed to return to}} their homes in Béxar; Dickinson, her daughter and Joe were sent to Gonzales, escorted by Ben. They were encouraged to relate the events of the battle, and to inform the remainder of the Texian forces that Santa Anna's army was unbeatable.|$|E

Using data from semi-structured interviews, {{through the lens}} of Hermeneutic anthropology, the concepts of medical-decision-making, the mindful body and narratives of disruption are explored. In addition, there is a brief history of acupuncture needles, their regulation in the United States and the possibility of multiple interpretations of material objects. The topic of the appropriateness of randomized clinical trials as a tool for verifying the efficacy of acupuncture treatment is discussed.

5|$|The Magic Wand {{has found}} great {{commercial}} {{success as a}} vibrator, a masturbation aid for women. Its popularity for this purpose {{is associated with the}} American artist and sex educator Betty Dodson, who used it in demonstrations and instructional classes to instruct women regarding self-pleasure techniques. Dodson became active in the sex-positive movement in the late 1960s. She recommended women put a small towel over their sex organs in order to dull the sensation of the vibrator and prolong the pleasurable experience. Her technique became known as the Betty Dodson Method. Her sessions were known as Bodysex workshops and featured 15 naked women in supine position, each using a Magic Wand simultaneously to aid in masturbation. She provided a Magic Wand to <b>each</b> <b>woman</b> for these two-hour masturbation sessions. Dodson taught thousands of women to achieve orgasm using this technique.|$|E

Consequently, a power {{struggle}} breaks out between Sam – who wants her pub back in return for her silence – and Chrissie, with <b>each</b> <b>woman</b> trying to gain control of Zoe. In the meantime, Chrissie publicly accounts for Den's sudden absence by declaring that he has run off with another woman and attempts to make her story convincing by throwing his clothes into the street and engaging in a bogus phone conversation with him in front of a packed pub. She successfully removes Zoe from the Square for a time, and begins a relationship with Jake Moon (Joel Beckett); however, Sam has taken the doorstop and hidden it in her flat. She then proceeds to blackmail Chrissie by saying that unless the pub is given back to her, she will inform the police. Chrissie stalls for time, and eventually calls Sam's bluff, declaring that she will take Sam down with her if she goes to the police. Desperate, Sam tries to corner Chrissie by telling Zoe the truth. Zoe confronts Chrissie before fleeing to Spain, telling her mother Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) what has happened before she goes.|$|E
5|$|There {{are almost}} no written sources {{from which to}} {{reconstruct}} the demography of early medieval Scotland. Estimates have been made of a population of 10,000 in Dál Riata and 80–100,000 for Pictland, which was probably the largest region. It {{is likely that the}} fifth and sixth centuries saw higher mortality rates due to the appearance of bubonic plague, which may have reduced the population. The examination of burial sites for this period, such as that at Hallowhill, St Andrews, indicates a life expectancy of only 26 to 29. The known conditions have been taken to suggest it was a high fertility, high mortality society, similar to developing countries in the modern world, with a relatively young demographic profile, and perhaps early childbearing, and large numbers of children born to <b>each</b> <b>woman</b> (although with high child mortality). This would have meant a relatively low ratio of available workers to the number of mouths to feed, which in turn would have made it difficult to produce a surplus that would allow demographic growth and the development of more complex societies.|$|E

25|$|The common motif {{in those}} {{different}} parallels {{is that the}} wise judge announces an absurd procedure, which is reasonable in some perverse way: Splitting the baby, according {{to the principle of}} compromise; Or a tug war, in which one can possibly assume that the true mother will be motivated to pull harder.

Into this arrives the charismatic and sexually aggressive son of von Rothbart, the Private Secretary, in black leather pants, who intensifies the sexual tension even further by flirting with every woman present, including the Queen. <b>Each</b> <b>woman</b> finds herself drawn to him and actively participates in the mutual, sometimes lewd, flirtation.|$|E

Since the brothel was keeping 30% to 40% of the client fees, and the women were charging between 600 and 800 pesos, and the brothel was earning money from the drinks the women sold, then the women were probably averaging two to three men per night, less than half of Kinan's estimate.

25|$|The Democratic Party opposes {{attempts}} {{to reverse the}} 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe v.

As {{a matter of the}} right to privacy and of gender equality, many Democrats believe all women should have the ability to choose to abort without governmental interference.

25|$|According to existentialism, {{each man}} and <b>each</b> <b>woman</b> creates the essence (meaning) of their life; {{life is not}} {{determined}} by a supernatural god or an earthly authority, one is free. As such, one's ethical prime directives are action, freedom, and decision, thus, existentialism opposes rationalism and positivism. In seeking meaning to life, the existentialist looks to where people find meaning in life, in course of which using only reason {{as a source of}} meaning is insufficient; this gives rise to the emotions of anxiety and dread, felt in considering one's free will, and the concomitant awareness of death. According to Jean-Paul Sartre, existence precedes essence; the (essence) of one's life arises only after one comes to existence.|$|E

The Qur'an commands all Muslims to exert effort in the pursuit of knowledge, irrespective of their biological sex: it constantly encourages Muslims to read, think, contemplate and learn from the signs of God in nature. Moreover, Muḥammad encouraged education for both males and females: he declared that seeking knowledge was a religious duty binding upon every Muslim man and woman. Like her male counterpart, <b>each</b> <b>woman</b> is under a moral and religious obligation to seek knowledge, develop her intellect, broaden her outlook, cultivate her talents and then utilise her potential to the benefit of her soul and her society.|$|E

50|$|Shaker {{religion}} valued {{women and}} men equally in religious leadership. The church was hierarchical, and at <b>each</b> level <b>women</b> and men shared authority.
