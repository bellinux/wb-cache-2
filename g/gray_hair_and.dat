5|$|The story {{opens with}} a lengthy {{explanation}} of ratiocination. Dupin demonstrates his prowess by deducing his companion's thoughts as if through apparent supernatural power. The story then turns to the baffling double murder of Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter at their home in the Rue Morgue, a fictional street in Paris. According to newspaper accounts, the mother {{was found in a}} yard behind the house, with multiple broken bones and her throat so deeply cut that her head fell off when the body was moved. The daughter was found strangled to death and stuffed upside down into a chimney. The murders occurred in a fourth-floor room that was locked from the inside; on the floor were found a bloody straight razor, several bloody tufts of <b>gray</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> two bags of gold coins. Several witnesses reported hearing two voices {{at the time of the}} murder, one male and French, but disagreed on the language spoken by the other. The speech was unclear, and every witness admits that he does not know the language he claims to have heard.|$|E
25|$|The elder monk then {{referred}} Zhang and Wang {{to another}} place called Fuzhun Monastery (福泉庵), less than a half mile from where they were. The two hurried to Fuzhun Monastery. There, the abbot, with his <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> beard glowing under the sun, looked extremely dignified and holy. After listening to their explanation, he nodded in agreement.|$|E
2500|$|Wang An-shih, a high {{magistrate}} of the Sung dynasty (960-1278 A.D.), was {{a learned}} scholar but recklessly irreverent, and so introduced, radical innovations in his administration. People complained, officers demurred, and the emperor expressed surprise; {{but he would}} say, [...] "Heavenly omens should not be heeded, human discontent need not be minded, {{and there is no}} sense in following the ancestral laws." [...] He and his son, who assisted him in his office, even attempted to revive the ancient cruel custom of corporal punishment; but before the law was passed, the son died, and Wang An-shih built a Buddhist temple on the site of his son's residence. While the magistrate was performing the customary Buddhist rite, he thought he faintly perceived in the flame of a burning candle the image of his son, bound hand and foot in a cangue, crying: [...] "Our attempt to revive corporal mutilation angered Heaven, and I have no chance of getting out of this infernal torture." [...] Later An-shih fell in disgrace; he lost his position and died miserably in exile. Now it happened that soon afterwards, one of An-shih's relatives was taken ill, and swooned, and when he recovered, {{he said that he had}} been ushered into a special department in hell, where hung the sign: [...] "Wickedness and Crime Eternally Prohibited," [...] and there lie saw a noble-looking man in a cangue, who had <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> large eyes. Though he did not mention the name of this unfortunate person, everyone around knew that it was Wang An-shih of whom he spoke. When An-shih's daughter inquired what could be done, the sick man simply said: [...] "All that is necessary is to accumulate merits and nothing more." [...] (tr. Suzuki and Carus 1906: 96-97) ...|$|E

60|$|Cousin Maria {{was a tall}} woman, {{dressed in}} black. She had <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> wore spectacles. She seemed very glad to see Tony, and shook hands with him warmly.|$|E
60|$|At {{last two}} solemn-looking monkeys with <b>gray</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> wearing long black coats and white neckties, {{came up to}} the cage, where they were greeted with much respect by the other monkeys.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{was my own}} experience; for {{of wisdom}} I could find nothing except in his <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> {{decrepit}} appearance. His first opening betrayed him; no great well of wit this Marechal, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Trouble {{has done}} it, Bilgewater, trouble has done it; trouble has brung these <b>gray</b> <b>hairs</b> <b>and</b> this {{premature}} balditude. Yes, gentlemen, you see before you, in {{blue jeans and}} misery, the wanderin', exiled, trampled-on, and sufferin' rightful King of France." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She has disgraced my <b>gray</b> <b>hairs,</b> <b>and</b> {{made me a}} reproach and a shame. I {{will not}} see her. Bid her begone. I will not speak to her or look at her. How came she there? When did she come?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Hereupon, the Twice-Blind, who being deaf, heard {{not what}} was said, tore his <b>gray</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> cried, [...] "Alas! alas! my boy; thou wert the merriest man in Mardi, and now thy pranks are over!" ...|$|E
60|$|A tall fellow came in, with a mane of <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> {{a ragged}} thin beard. He wore a {{dilapidated}} cloak and a wide-awake hat. He nodded to Philip, who {{had met him}} there before.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Yes, sir,' I said; 'we {{are both}} of us, fortunately, {{of an age}} to set {{circumstances}} at defiance' (I had seen the old wretch looking at my <b>gray</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> satisfying himself that his character was safe if he was seen with me).|$|E
50|$|From then he give commentaries at Fuji TV, Bunka Hōsō and Nikkan Sports. As a commentator, he {{was known}} for his cheerful loud laughter, <b>grayed</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> {{apparent}} but innocent favoritism toward the Yomiuri Giants (he often couldn't remember the names of non-Giants players).|$|R
6000|$|... "Now thou old miser!" [...] quoth Robin, [...] "well thou knowest {{that so many}} {{horned cattle}} are worth seven hundred pounds and more, and even that is but small for them, and yet thou, with thy <b>gray</b> <b>hairs</b> <b>and</b> {{one foot in the}} grave, wouldst trade upon the folly of a wild youth." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{flower head}} is urn-shaped {{and covered in}} phyllaries. The head opens {{slightly}} at the top, revealing many yellow disc florets and sometimes one or more tiny yellow ray florets, although these may be absent. The fruit is a long, thin achene coated in ashy <b>gray</b> <b>hairs</b> <b>and</b> tipped with a pappus of long, white bristles.|$|R
60|$|Ramonti, {{with his}} still {{youthful}} face, his dark eyebrows, his short, pointed, foreign, brown beard, his distinguished head of <b>gray</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> his artist's temperament--revealed in his light, gay and sympathetic manner--was a welcome tenant {{in the old}} house near Abingdon Square.|$|E
60|$|In no way, {{save the}} <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> the parchment-surfaced skin, had the old fellow changed {{in all these}} years. Without bodily vices, and {{clinging}} ever to the open air and the exercise of the foil, he was still young in muscle and endurance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Life here on {{the border}} is keen, hard, invigorating," [...] said Colonel Zane. [...] "I tell you, George Sheppard, in spite of your <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> your pretty daughter, you have come out West {{because you want to}} live among men who do things." ...|$|E
60|$|Referring to woman's sphere in life, I'll {{say that}} woman is always right. For twenty-five years I've been a woman's rights man. I have always believed, long before my mother died, that, with her <b>gray</b> <b>hairs</b> <b>and</b> admirable intellect, perhaps she knew {{as much as}} I did. Perhaps she knew as much about voting as I.|$|R

60|$|McDermott plied his weapon, {{and ever}} and anon he would utter some pessimistic word, or presage dire disaster, or remind Casey that his scalp {{was destined to}} dry in a Sioux's lodge, or call on Shane to hit {{something}} to save his life, or declare the engine was off the track. He rambled on. But it was all talk. The man had <b>gray</b> <b>hairs</b> <b>and</b> he was a born fighter.|$|R
60|$|The {{flickering}} light showed Mr. Sheppard to be a well-preserved {{old man with}} <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> ruddy, kindly face. The nephew had a boyish, frank expression.

6000|$|Look on my thin <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> hollow cheeks [...] And {{on these}} hands {{that may not}} lift the sword [...] This body {{trembling}} like a wind-blown reed. [...] No woman loves me, no man seeks my help, [...] Because I be not of the things I dream.|$|E
60|$|In a {{sense it}} was interesting. Monsieur Grisson {{sat there in}} front of his open table. His secretary's place by his side was vacant. Opposite sat a tall man with <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> dark moustache. He was dressed for the evening, and his breast glittered with stars and orders.|$|E
6000|$|... "That, Madam, is {{a strange}} prayer to be offered up at such a moment," [...] replied the unknown guest of the Province House, and courteously {{removing}} his hat, he offered his arm to raise the aged woman. [...] "Yet, in reverence for your <b>gray</b> <b>hairs</b> <b>and</b> long-kept faith, Heaven forbid that any here should say you nay. Over the realms which still acknowledge his sceptre, God save King George!" ...|$|R
50|$|Bellow {{uses the}} twin {{events of the}} death of Leventhal's nephew and the jarring {{conflict}} with Allbee to portray a period of self-examination and growth {{in the life of the}} protagonist. Although his tangles with Allbee nearly end in disaster, he parts with his brother on good terms, and in a final chapter, we learn that he has been promoted, looks younger despite <b>graying</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> is about to become a father.|$|R
5000|$|A {{success in}} Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth proved beyond {{any doubt that}} the Grumpy Old Woman is a global phenomenon. As stated in the {{official}} website, [...] "from Cardiff to Canberra, women {{of a certain age}} could finally unite behind a common fear of <b>graying</b> <b>hairs</b> <b>and</b> sagging rears. Around the world it was suddenly ok to celebrate the cellulite. This again made the Grumpies very happy. We came, we grumbled, we conquered." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Chingachgook!" [...] {{returned}} the Delaware girl, sighing out the harsh name, in sounds so softly guttural, as to {{cause it to}} reach the ear in melody--"His father, Uncas--great chief of the Mahicanni--next to old Tamenund!--More as warrior, not so much <b>gray</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> less at Council Fire. You know Serpent?" ...|$|E
60|$|Presently Nettlewick {{was aware}} of a big man towering above him at his elbow--a man sixty years of age, rugged and hale, with a rough, grizzled beard, a mass of <b>gray</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> a pair of {{penetrating}} blue eyes that confronted the formidable glasses of the examiner without a flicker.|$|E
6000|$|... "If it wasn't for you, Miss Holmes, I believe I'd {{have a try}} for him myself, {{in spite}} of his <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> quick temper--for Mrs. Maxwell says he has a pretty quick temper, but it's all over in a minute," [...] said Wilhelmina, half in jest and wholly in earnest.|$|E
5000|$|The {{man was a}} {{white male}} aged 65 to 70 who was [...] tall and weighed 160 lb. He had <b>graying</b> brown <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>gray</b> eyes.|$|R
60|$|In this dismal seclusion, silently the hermit {{confronted the}} minstrel; his <b>gray</b> <b>hair,</b> eyes, <b>and</b> beard all gleaming, as if {{streaked}} with phosphorus; while his ghastly gorget grinned hideously, {{with all its}} jaws.|$|R
