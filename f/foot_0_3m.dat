40|$|Background Pedobarography offers dynamic {{information}} about the foot, but the interpretation of its large data is challenging. In a prior study it was shown that attention can be restricted to pedobarographic midfoot load data. We aim to verify this observation in ankle osteoarthritic and contralateral feet. Methods We assessed both feet of 120 patients with end-stage ankle osteoarthritis (OA) and 35 healthy volunteers with AOFAS-score and dynamic pedobarography in barefoot condition. We introduce a new parameter, the Relative Midfoot Index (RMI), representing {{the depth of the}} midfoot weighted by the maximal force (MF) in the hindfoot and forefoot. Main outcome measures were the RMI, MF and contact times in the hindfoot, midfoot and forefoot. Ankle OA, contralateral and healthy feet were compared with ANOVA. Results The RMI was significantly smaller in OA <b>feet</b> (<b>0.</b> 65 [*]±[*] 0. 19) and contralateral <b>feet</b> (<b>0.</b> 69 [*]±[*] 0. 15) than in healthy <b>feet</b> (<b>0.</b> 84 [*]±[*] 0. 08, p[*]<[*] 0. 0001). There {{was no significant difference between}} OA and contralateral feet. The RMI showed a correlation of 0. 48 with the AOFAS score.

40|$|Background Various {{different}} {{clinical and}} radiographic measures of foot posture {{have been reported}} in the literature. Two of the more widely used clinical measures are the navicular drop and the arch index. Despite their common use, there is little in the way of research assessing the degree of correlation between them. Aim of the Study To determine the degree of correlation between the arch index and the navicular drop. Method A total of 14 school children from a single primary school were recruited for this study. Navicular drop and arch index measures were taken from each participant in one single session. Ten of 14 participants (average age of 10. 4 years) were used for statistical analysis. Both the traditional measures of arch index and navicular drop were calculated along with a novel method of calculating the navicular drop as a percentage change. Data Analysis All data was analysed using the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) software. Pearson’s correlation was used to assess the degree of correlation between the arch index and the navicular drop (mm and percentage change) in both feet. Kappa analysis was performed for secondary analysis to see if these two measures agreed once the numerical data was transformed into its categorical form. Results Strong correlation was noted between the right foot navicular drop (percentage change) and arch index (r= 0. 971) but poor in the left <b>foot</b> (r= <b>0.</b> 429). There was poor correlation between the traditional measure of navicular drop and arch index for both feet (left <b>foot,</b> r= <b>0.</b> 496, right <b>foot,</b> r= - <b>0.</b> 541). Kappa analysis showed poor agreement between the two measures of navicular drop (mm) and arch index (right <b>foot</b> <b>0.</b> 23, left <b>foot</b> <b>0.</b> 166) Conclusion The results of this study are inconclusive. In the right foot, strong correlation was noted between the arch index and the navicular drop (percentage change). In the left foot, correlation was poor. Kappa analysis demonstrated the 2 measures do not agree. Further research of good methodological quality is needed to assess the degree of correlation between measures of foot posture...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{diagnosis}} of Sudeck's syndrome stage 1 (nowadays termed complex regional pain syndrome I, abbreviated CRPS I) {{is based on}} clinical features, namely swelling and pain in a limb. Plain X-ray may be normal. In the absence of pain sensitivity, e. g. in diabetic neuropathy, CRPS I of the foot can be mistaken for Charcot's <b>foot</b> stage <b>0</b> (so-called neuro-osteoarthropathy). Case presentation The case of a type- 1 diabetic woman is reported, in whom CRPS I following a calcaneal fracture was mistaken for Charcot's osteoarthropathy (because of bone marrow edema displayed by conventional MR imaging). In addition, a review is presented on 6 consecutive cases with CRPS I of the foot, and on 20 cases with Charcot's <b>foot</b> stage <b>0,</b> with particular emphasis on MR imaging findings. The number of bones per foot affected with marrow edema was similar in either condition, with a tendency towards a more patchy, diffuse distribution of bone marrow edema in CRPS I. Bone marrow edema apparently regressed more promptly in response to treatment in Charcot's <b>foot</b> stage <b>0.</b> Conclusion Differentiation of CRPS I from Charcot's <b>foot</b> stage <b>0</b> remains a diagnostic dilemma in patients with pain insensitivity. Conventional MRI may be helpful, when repeated for monitoring the treatment response. </p...|$|R
40|$|Sinkhole {{flooding}} on {{the urban}} karst area of Bowling Green, Kentucky, was studied by investigating past flood {{events in the}} South Sunrise/Media Drive Sinkhole. The actual flood levels of four floods were compared to levels calculated by an empirical runoff determination method. Outflow capacity tests and dye tracing revealed the nature of drainage within the karst depression. The Soil Conservation Service runoff determination method and the three-hour maximum rainfall event were used to estimate the level of flooding. Three of the four flood events studied provided deviations between the actual and calculated flood levels of less than <b>0.</b> 26 <b>feet</b> (<b>0.</b> 08 meters). The fourth event produced a deviation of 1. 45 <b>feet</b> (<b>0.</b> 44 meters) which was explained by the intense nature of the precipitation event. Analysis of the data resulted in the conclusion that surface storm water runoff exceeded the outflow capacity of the sinkhole drains during all four flood events and that the peak flood elevations were {{not related to the}} level of the water table in the area. Evidence also suggested that drainage from the base of the South Sunrise/Media Drive Sinkhole occurs through interconnecting voids associated with a cave roof breakdown pile, and not through an efficient system of solution conduits...|$|R
