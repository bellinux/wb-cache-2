5|$|Since {{the program}} started in 1982, only three formal studies over the {{nutritional}} {{impact of the}} benefits provided to each family have been publicly released, in 1985, 1993, and 1996, respectively.

Educational opportunities for girls were few: they did not attend regular schools but were taught in groups at home by tutors. With few exceptions, education was limited to literacy and the Bible; a famous exception is the princess Anna Komnene (1083–1153), whose Alexiad displays a great depth of erudition, and the renowned 9th century Byzantine poet and composer Kassiani.
