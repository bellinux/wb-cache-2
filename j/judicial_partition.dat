40|$|In the 6 th book, {{entitled}} "Procédures spéciales", the Code of Civil Procedure {{regulates the}} way to solve some civil cases {{in accordance with the}} special procedural standards, but which are perfect and supplemented by depositions of the law. In the category of special procedures, the legislator has included: Presidential Ordinance, the procedure of the recasting of the writings and decisions disappeared, the procedure of real offer, the procedure of divorce, the procedure of <b>judicial</b> <b>partition,</b> sequester (taken-closed), the court sequester, the solution of commercial disputes, and others. A significant number of special procedures are reviewed under the disciplines of administrative law, financial and constitutional law, and so on. There are others that are regulated by special legislation, such as: Law no. 64 / 1995, republished and modified, concerning the procedure of judicial reorganization and bankruptcy, the Law no. 7 / 1996 of cadastre and real estate advertising, the Law no. 168 / 1999 on resolving labor disputes and Government Ordinance no. 5 / 2001 on the procedure for the summons in order to pay. These special regulations are taken into consideration for the achievement of a speedy trial in certain domains, with the result of the advocacy and social values...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} workload allocation {{techniques for}} clusters of computers. The workload {{in question is}} homogenous or heterogeneous. Homogeneous workload contains only QoS-demanding jobs (QDJ) or non-QoS jobs (NQJ) while heterogeneous workload {{is a mix of}} QDJs and NQJs The processing platform used is a single cluster or multiple clusters of computers. Two workload allocation strategies (called ORT and OMR) are developed for homogeneous workloads by establishing and numerically solving optimisation equation sets. The ORT strategy achieves the Optimised mean Response Time for homogeneous NQJ workload; while the OMR strategy achieves the Optimised mean Miss Rate for homogeneous QDJ workload. Based on ORT and OMR, a heterogeneous workload allocation strategy is developed to dynamically partition the clusters into two parts. Each part is managed by ORT or OMR to exclusively process NQJs or QDJs. The <b>judicial</b> <b>partitioning</b> achieves an optimised comprehensive performance, which combines the mean response time and the mean miss rate. The effectiveness (of these workload allocation techniques is demonstrated through queueing-theoretical analysis as well as through experimental studies. These techniques can be applied to e-business workload management to improve the distribution of different types of requests in clusters servers...|$|R
