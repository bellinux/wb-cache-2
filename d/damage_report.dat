About an hour later, a British Short Sunderland flying boat reported the oil slick to Suffolk and Norfolk, which had been joined by the damaged Prince of Wales.

500|$|As of July 1989 about $500 {{million in}} {{donations}} had been {{delivered to the}} Armenians from 113 countries. Most of those funds went into the initial relief work and medical care plus the beginning portion of the rebuilding phase. Yuri S. Mkhitarian, an Armenian State Building Committee official, gave an updated <b>damage</b> <b>report</b> that included some of the outlying communities away from the population centers stating that 342 villages were damaged and another 58 were destroyed. The negative effect the earthquake had on the economy of Armenia was apparent. Mkhitarian said that 130 factories were destroyed and 170,000 people were out of work. Officials acknowledged that the work to complete the rebuilding may take {{up to five years}} or longer, a supposition that more than doubled Gorbachev's estimate of two years. At that time 20 projects had completed the planning process and some had been approved and construction started. In Leninakan there was a need for 18 new hospitals, 12 of which could be funded {{with the assistance of the}} republics of the Soviet Union, but foreign help would be required to build six additional facilities. Boris Karapetyan, director of earthquake studies at the Yerevan Polytechnical Institute, said of the difficult rebuilding process [...] "Coordination is a major, major problem. This is a massive undertaking, and foreign involvement is both a necessary and a complicating factor. We need foreign assistance—and there is no doubt about that—but our friends do not know the local conditions and propose things that cannot or should not be built in an earthquake-prone region." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the ferocity}} of the night fighting, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British {{destroyer}} forces and reached Horns Reef by 4:00 on 1June. At 06:20, however, Ostfriesland struck a mine, previously laid by the destroyer [...] on 4 May, on her starboard side. The ship hauled out of line, as the explosion was initially {{thought to have been}} a torpedo fired by a submarine. Ostfriesland fell behind the fleet and steamed at slow speed, screened by the destroyers , , and briefly by [...] By 10:40, the battleship had increased speed to [...] Her anti-submarine escort was eventually reinforced by a floatplane, which spotted what it believed to be a British submarine at 12:20. Ostfriesland turned away, which caused the torpedo bulkhead, damaged slightly by the mine explosion, to tear open. More water entered the ship and caused a 4.75degree list to starboard, forcing Ostfriesland to reduce speed again. The ship requested assistance from a pumping ship at 14:20, but by 14:45 the flooding was under control and the ship passed the Outer Jade Lightship. She was able to increase speed gradually to , and at 18:15 she reached port in Wilhelmshaven. The mine tore a hole that measured [...] and allowed [...] of water into the ship. Further flooding occurred after the torpedo bulkhead damage at 12:20, though the full <b>damage</b> <b>report</b> has not survived. Ostfriesland was drydocked in Wilhelmshaven for repairs, which lasted until 26 July. In the course of the battle, Ostfriesland fired 111 rounds from her main battery, 101 shells from her 15cm guns, and a single 8.8cm shell. The only damage sustained was the mine that was struck on the morning of 1 June, which killed one man and wounded ten.|$|E

Each of these USN carriers suffered more casualties than all the British RN armoured carriers combined, illustrating the life saving features of RN carrier design. Illustrious, which had the highest toll, suffered 126 fatal casualties and 84 wounded when hit by six 1100lb bombs on 10 January 1941.
