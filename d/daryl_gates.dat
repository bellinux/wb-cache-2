5|$|Springfield's Most Wanted was a TV special {{hosted by}} John Walsh, host of America's Most Wanted. The special aired on September 17, 1995, before Part Two of Who Shot Mr. Burns?. A parody of Walsh's {{television}} series, this special {{was designed to}} help people find out who shot Mr. Burns, by laying out the potential clues and identifying the possible suspects. It features opinions from former Los Angeles police chief <b>Daryl</b> <b>Gates</b> and predictions from Dennis Franz, Courtney Thorne-Smith, Kevin Nealon, Chris Elliott, and Andrew Shue. It was directed by Bill Brown and written by Jack Parmeter and Bob Bain.|$|E
25|$|Under Parker, LAPD {{created the}} first SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics) team in United States law enforcement.

25|$|Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) is an {{education}} program {{that seeks to}} prevent use of controlled drugs, membership in gangs, and violent behavior. It was founded in Los Angeles in 1983 as a joint initiative of then-LAPD chief <b>Daryl</b> <b>Gates</b> and the Los Angeles Unified School District as a demand-side drug control strategy of the American War on Drugs.|$|E
25|$|LAPD {{chief of}} police <b>Daryl</b> <b>Gates,</b> who had seen his {{successor}} Willie L.

25|$|Early in {{his tenure}} as Chief of Police, <b>Daryl</b> <b>Gates</b> re-instituted {{the use of the}} choke hold (placing an arm or {{flashlight}} over someone's throat) in order to subdue suspects. In 1982, this technique was used and lead to the death of a suspect James Mincey Jr. Following Mincey's death, the Police Commission barred the use of the chokehold by officers unless it was in a life-threatening situation. An investigation into the use of the choke hold found that sixteen people had died after being restrained by police choke holds.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{watching}} {{the tape of}} the beating, LAPD chief of police <b>Daryl</b> <b>Gates</b> said: I stared at the screen in disbelief. I played the one-minute-50-second tape again. Then again and again, until I had viewed it 25 times. And still I could not believe what I was looking at. To see my officers engage {{in what appeared to}} be excessive use of force, possibly criminally excessive, to see them beat a man with their batons 56 times, to see a sergeant on the scene who did nothing to seize control, was something I never dreamed I would witness.|$|E
25|$|Widespread looting, assault, arson, and killings {{occurred}} during the riots, and estimates of property damage were over $1 billion. Order was only restored after members of the California Army National Guard, the 7th Infantry Division, and the 1st Marine Division were called in to stop the rioting when local police could not control the situation. In total, 63 people were killed during the riots, 2,383 people were injured, and more than 12,000 were arrested. LAPD chief of police <b>Daryl</b> <b>Gates,</b> who had already announced his resignation {{by the time of}} the riots, took much of the institutional blame.|$|E

25|$|The first {{significant}} {{deployment of the}} LAPD's SWAT unit was on December9, 1969, in a four-hour confrontation {{with members of the}} Black Panthers in a densely populated area of Los Angeles. The raid was problematic from the start, leading to a shoot-out in which <b>Daryl</b> <b>Gates</b> phoned the Department of Defense, requesting and receiving permission to use a grenade launcher. The Panthers eventually surrendered, with four Panthers and four officers being injured. All six arrested Panthers were acquitted of the most serious charges brought against them, including conspiracy to murder police officers, because it was ruled that they acted in self-defense.|$|E
500|$|Ice-T {{referred}} to the album's final track, [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as a protest song, stating that the song is [...] " [...] {{in the first person}} as a character who is fed up with police brutality." [...] The song was written in 1990, and had been performed live several times, including at Lollapalooza, before it had been recorded in a studio. The album version mentions then-Los Angeles police chief <b>Daryl</b> <b>Gates</b> and the black motorist Rodney King, whose beating by LAPD officers was recorded on videotape. In The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a Fuck?, Ice-T wrote that the song [...] " [...] a warning, not a threat—to authority that says, 'Yo, police: We're human beings. Treat us accordingly.'" [...] In an interview for Rolling Stone, Ice-T stated that [...] "We just celebrated the fourth of July, which is really just national Fuck the Police Day [...] I bet that during the Revolutionary War, there were songs similar to mine." ...|$|E
500|$|... "A House Divided" [...] {{served as}} both an {{introduction}} to the now common practice of season-ending cliffhangers and the beginning of an eight-month international media frenzy. International oddsmakers created a set of odds for the possible suspects: [...] "Dusty Farlow (J. R.'s wife Sue Ellen's lover, who disappeared after a plane crash) is the 6 to 4 favorite, followed by Vaughn Leland (a banker J. R. swindled) and Kristin Shepard (J. R.'s mistress) at 4 to 1. Sue Ellen herself is a long shot at 25 to 1, as is J.R.'s long- suffering mom, Miss Ellie." [...] After Sue Ellen's fingerprints were found on the gun in subsequent episodes she became the favorite at 3 to 1 according to some oddsmakers, while others listed Shepard and Cliff Barnes as favorites. Even Jimmy The Greek posted odds of various suspects. Tony Schwartz of The New York Times estimates that viewers in 57 countries saw the episode. [...] The script for the subsequent episode that revealed the killer was stolen from Lorimar Productions. The Los Angeles Herald Examiner claimed to have received a copy from a [...] "news source". Eventually they returned it to Los Angeles Police Department Chief <b>Daryl</b> <b>Gates.</b> [...] Discussion about the mystery took place in a variety of media forms including Time.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{the release}} of the Rodney King tape, {{minority}} community leaders in Los Angeles had repeatedly complained about harassment and excessive use of force by LAPD officers. An independent commission formed after {{the release of}} the tape concluded that a [...] "significant number" [...] of LAPD officers [...] "repetitively use excessive force against the public and persistently ignore the written guidelines of the department regarding force," [...] and that bias related to race, gender, and sexual orientation were regularly contributing factors in use of excessive force.

2500|$|After the {{verdicts}} were announced, {{a crowd of}} protesters formed at the Los Angeles police headquarters at Parker Center in Downtown Los Angeles. The crowd grew as the afternoon passed, and as this group grew and became violent, a moving skirmish line formed between police protecting the building and protesters advancing on it. In the midst of this, before 6:30 pm, police chief <b>Daryl</b> <b>Gates</b> left Parker Center, {{on his way to}} the neighborhood of Brentwood. There, as the situation in Los Angeles deteriorated, Gates attended a political fundraiser against Los Angeles City Charter Amendment F, which was stated to [...] "give City Hall more power over the police chief and provide more civilian review of officer misconduct", and would limit the power and term length of his own position.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Historical Dictionary of Law Enforcement, {{the term}} [...] "SWAT" [...] {{was used as}} an acronym for the [...] "Special Weapons and Tactics" [...] {{established}} as a 100-man specialized unit in 1964 by the Philadelphia Police Department in response to an alarming increase in bank robberies. The purpose of this unit was to react quickly and decisively to bank robberies while they were in progress, by utilizing a large number of specially trained officers who had at their disposal a great amount of firepower. The tactic worked and was later soon to resolve other types of incidents involving heavily armed criminals. Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) Inspector <b>Daryl</b> <b>Gates</b> has said that he first envisioned [...] "SWAT" [...] as an acronym for [...] "Special Weapons Attack Team" [...] in 1967, but later accepted [...] "Special Weapons and Tactics" [...] on the advice of his deputy chief, Edward M.

2500|$|Villaraigosa {{vowed to}} hire 1,000 new police officers. On March 6, 2009, Mayor Villaraigosa and Police Chief Bratton {{announced}} that the L.A.P.D. had expanded to its largest force in city history. On May 14, 2009, City Council approved an LAPD/LAFD hiring freeze. In a television advertisement {{paid for by the}} Villaraigosa campaign, Chief Bratton stated that [...] "Crime is down to levels of the 1950s." [...] Twenty-four hours before the March 3 Election Day, Villaraigosa and Bratton reannounced a statement from the Mayor’s Office that the “citywide crime-rate drop to the lowest level since 1956, the total number of homicides fall to a 38-year low. Gang homicides were down more than 24 percent in 2008.” However, former Chief of Police <b>Daryl</b> <b>Gates</b> argued against this statistic, citing a trend toward lengthier prison sentences for career criminals as the reason for the change. In fact, crime fell by 43 percent across California between 1994 and 1999. The figures are also disputed by Patrick Range McDonald and Professor Andrew Karmen, John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Karmen stated that, adjusting for population, the Los Angeles murder rate would need to be 180 or less to be equivalent to the crime rate of 1956, with its rate of 104 homicides per 2.2 million people, or one killing for every 22,115 people (the 2007 rate was 396 per 4 million people, or one killing per 10,101 people). McDonald further noted that, [...] "In 1956, 89 percent of homicides were cleared. Today, if you kill another human being in Los Angeles, chances are very good you will get away with it: 43 out of every 100 killers are not caught." [...] Similarly, he notes, [...] "In 1956, 42 percent of robberies were cleared by an arrest. Today, that number is 26 percent." ...|$|E
