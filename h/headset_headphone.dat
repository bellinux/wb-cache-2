40|$|Background: Recently the {{worldwide}} usage of earphones has increased {{especially among the}} school and college students who have {{a high rate of}} sharing among them. Alike airline <b>headsets,</b> <b>headphones</b> and stethoscope ear-pieces, ear phones can easily be a vector of potential pathogens, which can give rise to otitis externa. Purpose: To compare the bacterial growth of the external ear in association with earphone and assess the role of earphones as vector or microorganisms. Material and Methods: 50 voluntary male subjects (age 18 - 25 years) were chosen and divided into two groups, A and B, according to the use of earphones. Swabs were taken from their left ear and the left earpiece of the earphone. Samples were processed as recommended. Results: In group A, bacteria were found in 20 (80 %) ear and 14 (56 %) earphone swabs. In group B, bacteria were found in 23 (92 %) ear and 17 (68 %) earphone swabs. Group B showed heavy growth and {{a significant increase in the}} number of bacterial growths after frequent and constant use. Conclusion: Frequent and constant use of earphones increases the bacterial growth in the ear and sharing of earphones might be a potential vector of commensals. It is therefore, always better not to share or else to clean the earphones before sharin...|$|R
50|$|Three- or four-conductor (TRS or TRRS) 2.5 mm and 3.5 mm sockets {{are common}} on cell phones, {{providing}} mono (three conductor) or stereo (four conductor) sound and a microphone input, together with signaling (e.g., {{push a button}} to answer a call). Three-conductor 2.5 mm connectors are particularly common on older phones, while four-conductor 3.5 mm connectors are more common on newer smartphones. These are used both for handsfree headsets (esp. mono audio plus mic, also stereo audio plus mic, plus signaling for call handling) and for (stereo) headphones (stereo audio, no mic). Wireless (connectorless) <b>headsets</b> or <b>headphones</b> usually use the Bluetooth protocol.|$|R
5000|$|The aptX {{audio codec}} is {{available}} for consumer and automotive wireless audio applications, notably the real-time streaming of lossy stereo audio over the Bluetooth A2DP connection/pairing between a [...] "source" [...] device (such as a smartphone, tablet or laptop) and a [...] "sink" [...] accessory (namely a Bluetooth stereo speaker, <b>headset</b> or <b>headphones).</b> aptX technology must be incorporated in both transmitter and receiver to derive the sonic benefits of aptX audio coding over the default sub-band coding (SBC) mandated by the Bluetooth standard. Consumer electronics products bearing the CSR aptX logo are certified for interoperability with other Bluetooth audio products belonging to the aptX ecosystem.|$|R
50|$|A <b>headset</b> {{combines}} a <b>headphone</b> with a microphone. Headsets {{are made with}} either a single-earpiece (mono) or a double-earpiece (mono to both ears or stereo).

25|$|A <b>headset</b> is a <b>headphone</b> {{combined}} with a microphone. Headsets provide the equivalent functionality of a telephone handset with hands-free operation. Among applications for headsets, besides telephone use, are aviation, theatre or television studio intercom systems, and console or PC gaming. Headsets are made with either a single-earpiece (mono) or a double-earpiece (mono to both ears or stereo). The microphone arm of headsets is either an external microphone type where the microphone is held {{in front of the}} user's mouth, or a voicetube type where the microphone is housed in the earpiece and speech reaches it by means of a hollow tube.|$|R
50|$|Headsets are {{available}} in single-earpiece and double-earpiece designs. Single-earpiece headsets are known as monaural headsets. Double-earpiece headsets may support stereo sound, or use the same audio channel for both ear-pieces. Monaural headsets free up one ear, allowing interaction with others and awareness of surroundings. Telephone headsets are monaural, even for double-earpiece designs, because telephone offers only single-channel input and output. For computer or other audio applications, where the sources offer two-channel output, stereo headsets are the norm; use of a <b>headset</b> instead of <b>headphones</b> allows use for communications (usually monaural) in addition to listening to stereo sources.|$|R
50|$|Mixed reality {{allows a}} global {{workforce}} of remote teams {{to work together}} and tackle an organization’s business challenges. No matter where they are physically located, an employee can strap on their <b>headset</b> and noise-canceling <b>headphones</b> and enter a collaborative, immersive virtual environment. Language barriers will become irrelevant as AR applications are able to accurately translate in real time. It also means a more flexible workforce. While many employers still use inflexible models of fixed working time and location, there is evidence that employees are more productive if they have greater autonomy over where, when and how they work. Some employees prefer loud work spaces, others need silence. Some work best in the morning, others at night.Employees also benefit from autonomy in how they work because everyone processes information differently. The classic VAK model for learning styles differentiates Visual, Auditory and Kinesthetic learners.|$|R
5000|$|Apple added Voice Control to its {{family of}} iOS devices {{as a new}} feature of iOS 3. The iPhone 4S, the iPhone 5, the iPad (3rd and 4th generations), the iPad Mini, and the iPod Touch (5th generation) all come with a newer and more complex voice control system called Siri, {{replacing}} Voice Control, which is still present on older devices. Siri is a user independent built in speech recognition feature that allows a user to issue voice commands. With the assistance of Siri a user may issue the following voice commands: send a text message, check the weather, set a reminder, find information, schedule meetings, send an email, find a contact, set an alarm, get directions, track your stocks, set a timer, and ask for examples of sample voice command queries. [...] In addition, Siri works on Bluetooth <b>headsets</b> and wired <b>headphones.</b>|$|R
40|$|Participants {{reported}} the apparent lateralization of sounds {{as a function}} of interaural level differences, for stimuli delivered through bone-conduction <b>headsets</b> and standard <b>headphones.</b> The results showed that non-externalized spatial audio can be invoked with the bonephones, a device that provides the unique advantage of not covering the ears of the listener. Furthermore, the degree of lateralization with bonephones can be similar to that produced using headphones. These data provide a function relating the input into bonephones or headphones to the resulting percept of lateralization, in a manner that may be particularly useful for mobile and low-resource computing applications. The apparent location of a sound source can be used to facilitate many auditory display tasks, including wayfinding (Walker & Lindsay, 2006) and segregation of simultaneous speech channels (Walker, Stanley, Iyer, Simpson, & Brungart, 2005). Delivering interaural time and level differences through headphones is a simple way t...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to open a}} dialogue around fundamental questions of perception such as: how do we represent our ongoing auditory or visual perception of the world using our brain; what could these representations explain and not explain; and how can these representations eventually be modeled by computers? Rather than answer these questions scientifically, we will attempt to develop a computational arts practice presenting these questions to participants. The approach this thesis takes is computational scene synthesis: a computationally generative collage process where the units of the collage are built using perceptually-inspired representations. We explain how scene synthesis is built in detail and relate it to an existing lineage of collage-based practitioners. Then, working in auditory and visual domains separately, {{in order to bring}} questions of perception to the experience of the artwork, this thesis makes significant interdisciplinary strides from reviewing fundamental issues in perception in terms of experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience, to formulating and developing perceptually-inspired computational models of large databases of audiovisual material, to finally developing these models with a computationally generative collage-based arts practice. Two final practical outputs using audiovisual scene synthesis will be explored: (1) a short film series which {{attempts to}} recreate the number 1 video of the week on YouTube using only the audiovisual content from the remaining top 10 videos; and (2) a real-time augmented reality experience presented through a virtual reality <b>headset</b> and <b>headphones</b> presenting a scene synthesis of a participant's surroundings using only previously learned audiovisual fragments. Results from both outputs demonstrate the ability for scene synthesis to provoke meaningful engagements with one's own process of perception. The results further demonstrate that scene synthesis is capable of highlighting both theoretical and practical gaps in our current understanding of human perception and their computational implementations...|$|R
40|$|Patients with low-back {{pain can}} be {{evaluated}} immediately {{by means of}} an electrical tool that produces bony vibration to the lumbar spinal processes (Yrjama M, Vanharanta H. Bony vibrotactile stimulation: A new, non-invasive method for examining intradiscal pain. European Spine Journal 1994; 3 : 233 – 235). In the rehabilitation of masticatory disturbance and dysphagia, an electric toothbrush is commonly used as an oral motor exercise tool for the facilitation of blood flow and metabolism in the orofacial region in Japanese hospitals. However, subjects receiving vibration in the facial regions reported increased salivary secretion. We attempted to develop an oral motor exercise apparatus modified by a <b>headphone</b> <b>headset</b> that was fixed and could be used for extended periods. The vibration apparatus of the heating conductor is protected by the polyethyle methacrylate (dental mucosa protective material), and electric motors for vibration control of the PWM circuit. We examined the amount of salivation during vibration stimuli on the bilateral masseter muscle belly, using a cotton roll positioned {{at the opening of the}} secretory duct for 3 min. Although the quantity of salivation in each subject showed various and large fluctuations in the right and left sides of the parotid and submandibular and sublingual glands, one or more of the salivary glands were effectively stimulated by 89 Hz vibration. The reported apparatus will be useful as an additional method in orofacial rehabilitation...|$|R
