5|$|Cecil Brown’s {{political}} career spanned nearly 40 years (1876–1913). He {{was engaged in}} politics under four constitutions of the Kingdom of Hawaii prior to annexation by the United States: 1840, 1852, 1864, and 1887, and a constitution for the Republic of Hawaii (of which Brown {{was one of the}} framers) that was adopted on July 4, 1894.

5|$|Barlow {{immediately}} {{turned to}} investigate the strange sail, steering southwards directly at the lumbering vessel. Saulnier was seemingly unwilling to attempt any manoeuvere {{in the face of}} the enemy, as Africaine continued to hold the original course without deviation. By 19:30 it was inevitable that Phoebe would intercept Africaine and Saulnier shortened sail, slowing his frigate to meet the threat. Barlow was still unsure of the identity of the stranger and fired a shot over Africaine as a warning to its captain to identify his ship. Saulnier responded by turning to port and firing a broadside directly at Phoebe. It was poorly aimed however and mostly scattered into the sea without <b>effect.</b> <b>At</b> this, Barlow pulled Phoebe into a parallel position to Africaine and unleashed a much more devastating broadside from close range. The two frigates then began an exchange of fire at close range.|$|E

5|$|Chandralekha was in {{production}} {{for five years}} (1943–1948), with changes to its story, cast and filming which generated substantial time and cost overruns. The film ultimately cost 3million (about $600,000 in 1948), and was the most-expensive Indian film at the time. Vasan mortgaged all his property, received financial assistance from The Hindu editor K. Srinivasan and sold his jewellery to complete the film. Adjusted for inflation, Chandralekha would have cost $28million in 2010. According to historian S.

On April 6, the next portion of the freeway opened. However, there were concerns about what to call the freeway, citing confusion with the northern portion of SR75. The entire cost {{of the project was}} $6.3million. SR117 was extended east to SR125, replacing the southerly segment of SR75, by the Legislature in 1976; this took <b>effect</b> <b>at</b> the beginning of 1977. Estimates for completing the freeway ran from $13.8million to $28.5million.|$|E
5|$|Cross-lingual {{studies were}} {{performed}} at 13 European universities, using 12 different languages, viz.

Because the original yoked design did not lend itself well to long-distance research and standardization, it {{was replaced by a}} simpler, easier to replicate experimental design. Subjects were asked to mark the six capital letters they liked most in a randomized list containing all letters of the local alphabet, again without giving it much thought. They had to mark their first preference with 1, their second with 2, etc. The new method was first applied in Belgium.

In the 1941 election, {{there was a}} significant decrease in the independent vote, and both the Labor Party and the LCL made gains, with Playford forming the LCL's first majority government. This was in large part due to the LCL's shift to the right on social issues to usurp the independents' appeal. In 1942, compulsory voting (but not enrolment) was introduced, and first took <b>effect</b> <b>at</b> the 1944 election, with an increase in voter turnout from 51% to 89%.

5|$|Dust and {{possibly}} water ice from this belt migrates inward because of drag from the stellar wind and a {{process by which}} stellar radiation causes dust grains to slowly spiral toward Epsilon Eridani, known as the Poynting–Robertson <b>effect.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, these dust particles can be destroyed through mutual collisions. The time scale {{for all of the}} dust in the disk to be cleared away by these processes is less than Epsilon Eridani's estimated age. Hence, the current dust disk must have been created by collisions or other effects of larger parent bodies, and the disk represents a late stage in the planet-formation process. It would have required collisions between 11 Earth masses' worth of parent bodies to have maintained the disk in its current state over its estimated age.|$|E
5|$|Gromyko and Harriman debated how states {{not universally}} {{recognized}} (e.g., East Germany and China) could join the agreement. The US proposed asserting that accession {{to the treaty}} would not indicate international recognition. This {{was rejected by the}} Soviet Union. Eventually, with Kennedy's approval, US envoys Fisher and McNaughton devised a system whereby multiple government would serve as depositaries for the treaty, allowing individual states to sign only the agreement held by the government of their choice in association with other like-minded states. This solution, which overcame one of the more challenging roadblocks in the negotiations, also served to allay mounting concerns from Macmillan, which were relayed to Washington, that an agreement would once again be derailed. Finally, in an original Soviet draft, the signature of France would have been required for the treaty to come into <b>effect.</b> <b>At</b> Harriman's insistence, this requirement was removed.|$|E
