5|$|Rather than {{turn left}} towards Concord, Marine Lieutenant Jesse Adair, {{at the head}} of the advance guard, decided on his own to protect the flank of the British column by first turning right and then leading the {{companies}} onto the Common itself, in a confused effort to surround and disarm the militia. Major Pitcairn arrived from the rear of the advance force and led his three companies to the left and halted them.

25|$|During the Industrial Revolution, {{the area}} was home to a massive complex of {{factories}} and workshops and was accessed by part of the canal network, most notably the Digbeth Branch Canal which bisects the area. The Grand Union Canal is located along {{the boundaries of the}} area and meets the Digbeth Branch Canal at Warwick Bar. In the late 19th century, {{the area was}} accessed by a major tram network which ran along Albert Street. However, as the industry in the area subsided, the area fell into decline and many of the original factory buildings became derelict. The old Victorian factory buildings were never maintained and the canals became dirty and clogged with only small stretches being cleaned. Small independent businesses moved into the area. A major brewery was located near Curzon Street Station and this resulted in the establishment of a public house <b>further</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> which currently exists as a Grade II listed building.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the siege}} of Baghdad began, Muhammad b. 'Abdallah sent five hundred {{infantry}} and cavalry to al-Nahrawan to defend it against the Turks.

The defenders decided to meet the Turks on the field, and a battle ensued. The Turks soon gained the upper hand, and the defenders turned and fled to Baghdad. Fifty of the defenders {{had died in the}} battle, and the Turks sent their heads to Samarra, along with mounts and weapons that the defenders had abandoned. With the Turks victorious, they gained control of the Khorasan road, and traffic between there and Baghdad was cut off.

[...] Percy wrote of the colonial tactics, [...] "The rebels attacked us in a very scattered, irregular manner, but with perseverance and resolution, nor did they ever dare to form into any regular body.

2500|$|Some {{police forces}} use {{vehicles}} (or sometimes fake [...] "cut outs" [...] of vehicles) to deter crime.

They are placed in areas thought to be susceptible to crime in order to provide a high visibility presence without committing an officer. Examples of these can be seen on many main roads, freeways and motorways. In 2005, Virginia's (United States) legislature considered a bill which stated, in part: [...] "Whenever any law-enforcement vehicle is permanently taken out of service ... such vehicle shall be placed at a conspicuous location within a highway median in order to deter violations of motor vehicle laws at that location. Such vehicles shall ... be rotated from one location to another as needed to maintain their deterrent effect."; Such cars may also be used in conjunction with manned units hidden <b>further</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> to trick speeders into speeding back up again, and being clocked by the manned car. In Chicago, Illinois a small fleet of highly visible vans are parked alongside major state and federal routes with automated speed detection and camera equipment, monitoring both for speeders and other offenders by license plate.
