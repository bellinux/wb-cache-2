5|$|The {{colour pattern}} varies, ranging from very light-coloured {{specimens}} with small, incomplete, dark dorsal crossbars to entirely brown ones with faint or clear, darker brown markings, {{and on to}} melanistic individuals that are entirely dark and lack any apparent dorsal pattern. However, most <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> zigzag dorsal pattern down {{the entire length of}} their bodies and tails. The head usually has a distinctive dark V or X on the back. A dark streak runs from the eye to the neck and continues as a longitudinal series of spots along the flanks. Unusual for snakes, the sexes are possible to tell apart by the colour. Females are usually brownish in hue with dark-brown markings, the males are pure grey with black markings. The basal colour of males will often be slightly lighter than that of the females, making the black zigzag pattern stand out. The melanistic individuals are often females.|$|E
5|$|Other {{ichthyosaur}} remains {{had been}} discovered in years past at Lyme and elsewhere, but the specimen found by the Annings {{was the first to}} come to the attention of scientific circles in London. It was purchased by the lord of a local manor, who passed it to William Bullock for public display in London where it created a sensation. At a time when most people in Britain still believed in a literal interpretation of Genesis, that the Earth was only a few thousand years old and that species did not evolve or become extinct, the find raised questions in scientific and religious circles about what the new science of geology was revealing about ancient life and the history of the Earth. Its notoriety increased when Sir Everard Home wrote a series of six papers, starting in 1814, describing it for the Royal Society. The papers never mentioned who had collected the fossil, and in the first one he even mistakenly credited the painstaking cleaning and preparation of the fossil performed by Anning to the staff at Bullock's museum. Perplexed by the creature, Home kept changing his mind about its classification, first thinking {{it was a kind of}} fish, then thinking it might <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> affinity with the duck-billed platypus (only recently known to science); finally in 1819 he reasoned it might be a kind of intermediate form between salamanders and lizards, which led him to propose naming it Proteo-Saurus. By then Charles Konig, an assistant curator of the British Museum, had already suggested the name Ichthyosaurus (fish lizard) for the specimen and that name stuck. Konig purchased the skeleton for the museum in 1819. The skull of the specimen is still in the possession of the Natural History Museum in London (to which the fossil collections of the British Museum were transferred later in the century), but at some point, it became separated from the rest of the skeleton, the location of which is not known.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} {{assumption}} {{is to compare}} power densities at the same pressure, choosing the ion temperature for each reaction to maximize power density, and with the electron temperature equal to the ion temperature.

500|$|MacGregor {{went into}} {{hiding in the}} French provinces, while Lehuby fled to the {{southern}} Netherlands. Hippisley and Irving were informed on 6 September {{that they were being}} investigated for conspiracy to defraud and sell titles to land they did not own. Both insisted that they were innocent. They were taken that evening to La Force Prison. MacGregor was arrested after three months and brought to La Force on 7 December 1825. He speculated to his confederates that the charges against them must be the result of some abrupt change of policy by France, or of some Spanish intrigue calculated to undermine Poyaisian independence. The three men remained imprisoned without trial while the French attempted to extradite Lehuby from the Netherlands. Attempting to re-associate himself and Poyais with the republican movement in Latin America, MacGregor issued a French-language declaration from his prison cell on 10 January 1826, claiming that he was [...] "contrary to human rights, held prisoner... for reasons of which he is not aware" [...] and [...] "suffering as {{one of the founders of}} independence in the New World".
