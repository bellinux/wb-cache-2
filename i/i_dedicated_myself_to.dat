I made Lincoln my hero-he still is. But I was only a girl, and where was I to find this cause?--how to work for it? I was shut in by a thousand restrictions, hedged in by a thousand conventions. Everybody laughed at me when I expressed the thoughts that burned in me. What could I do? I was only a woman. I had neither vote nor right of utterance. I must remain silent. I must do nothing.

I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services. And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose? My life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.|$|E

40|$|In {{the thesis}} on the pro-social traits {{of workers in}} helping (assistance-providing) professions <b>I</b> <b>dedicate</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> pro-social behavior, empathy and the basic {{characteristics}} of personality issuing from the five-factor personality model { [...] } The Big Five. Most professionals agree that pro-social behavior and empathy belong among the basic characteristics that assistance-providing professionals should have. An important role is also {{the personality of the}} care provider. The listed constructs and connections among them however remain the home environment of empirical research and thereby represent the phenomena regarding which there exist few verified findings. The goal of the paper rests in fining the level of empathy and personal dispositions in accordance with the Big Five model that could influence pro-social behavior in selected groups of assistance-giving professionals. The factors in question are neuroticism, extroversion, and openness to experience, graciousness and conscientiousness. Data collection took place with the help of two psychodiagnostic questionnaires. The IRI questionnaire measures level of empathy and the NEO-FFI questionnaire was used for diagnosing the five personality dimensions. The study was quantitative. The monitored set included respondents from three assistance-giving professions { [...] } nurses, members of the Czech Republic Fire Rescue Corps, and elementary-school teachers. The results confirmed the hypothesis that care providing workers show higher levels of empathy in comparison to the population average, and the hypothesis that these professionals show a higher level of personality traits that, in an interpersonal context, display positive orientation towards others, that is that they are more extroverted and gracious in comparison with the population average, was refuted. These results make it possible to consider that the relationship between the basic personality dimensions and pro-social tendencies may be mediated by the level of empathy with regard to other psychological constructs and the results of social learning. Conclusions cannot be generalized, due to a relatively small sample group. For this purpose {{it would be interesting to}} carry out a professional study, which would exceed, in its scope and possibilities, the usual requirements of a thesis paper...|$|R

I transcend my personal reflections and transfer them into musical expressions to create a sonic world that connects my interior mind and the universe. When composing yet the dew remains in pale, I {{was inspired by the}} poem Jian Jia (Rush Leaves) that primarily expresses a longing for an intangible love. I interpreted an intangible love to be a dead person whom I miss but can only meet in a dream, or through a religious ritual. To express this sort of eternal longing, I created a musical dreamland in a mirror -like form that represents a transcendental journey to a spiritual space where I seek this intangible love. This mirror-like form musically represents a meditative process of intoning, transcending, reaching another land, falling, and returning. The pale dew, {{in stark contrast to the}} dream-like aura, symbolizes our inner tears that remain after journeying to the dreamland.

I have learned many life lessons through him, and I owe everything that I have accomplished to him. I have had many opportunities working with him on various projects and I am grateful to have come to his laboratory. Whether it was alligators, manatees, or bass, he always included me in his projects and I thank him for that. My committee members each have done so much for me over the years and I consider them each dear mentors and friends. Dr. Roger Reep and Dr. Don Samuelson have been helpful in teaching me the great world of histology. I was a teaching assistant in histology for Dr. Reep for over 5 years, and I can say that it {{is one of my favorite}} aspects of this project. Dr. Samuelson was an integral part in the laboratory preparation of my samples; the electron microscopy of thi...|$|R

'At {{the time}} <b>I</b> {{resolved}} <b>to</b> <b>dedicate</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> poetry and separate {{myself from the}} ordinary lucrative professions, it would certainly {{have been a great}} object to me to have reaped the profits I should have done from my writings but for the stupidity of Mr. Gifford and the impertinence of Mr. Jeffrey. It would have enabled me to purchase many books which I could not obtain, and I should have gone to Italy earlier, which I never could afford to do until I was sixty-five, when Moxon gave me a thousand pounds for my writings. This was the only kind of injury Mr. Jeffrey did me, for I immediately perceived that his mind was of that kind that his individual opinion on poetry was of no consequence to me whatever, that it was only by the influence his periodical exercised at the time in preventing my poems being read and sold that he could injure me; for feeling that my writings were founded on what was true and spiritual in human nature, I knew the time would come when they must be known, and I never therefore felt his opinion of the slightest value, except in preventing the young of that generation from receiving impressions which might have been of use to them through life. I say this, I hope not in a boasting spirit, but I am now daily surprised by receiving letters from various places at home and abroad expressive of gratitude to me from persons I never saw or heard of. As this occurs now, I may fairly conclude that it might have been so when the poems appeared, but for the tyranny exercised over public opinion by the Edinburgh and Quarterly Reviews.' ...|$|R
40|$|In an {{environment}} surrounded by man made laws, structures, norms, and boundaries {{it is often}} easy {{for a person to}} lose hope. People lacking in the most basic needs such as food, drink, shelter and human affection have a hard time understanding how people can spend money on extravagant homes, possessions, marketing, and expansion of economy and ignore their needs. This lack of understanding is the cause for much of the class, racial, and worldwide tension we are feeling in the twenty-first century. For these reasons and others, I have decided to dedicate over two years of my life serving in the Peace Corps. The people that I will go help have nothing and lack everything. I know that they will learn just as much from me about life and how to get by, as I do from them. The following thesis had been put together in hopes to explain how I came about to my Peace Corps decision, who and what influenced me along the way, as well as my photojournalism aspirations for the future. Born and raised in Catholic schools in Louisville, Kentucky, I was brought up in good morals and values, as well as in good education. My hobbies were and always will be basketball, photography and community service. In high school I loved playing basketball on the varsity team, but more so, I loved being the chief photographer for the school yearbook. This position spawned the birth of my photographic career. Through journalism class, I chose to attend Ball State University s School of Communications where <b>I</b> would <b>dedicate</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> becoming a photojournalist. At the same time, throughout all of grade school, high school and college, I have enjoyed volunteering for a plethora of non-profit and community service organizations. In high school I was involved in Beta Club and National Honors Society, as well as ACTS (A Christian Through Service) where I did anything from Nursing Homes to Soup Kitchens. Once at Ball State, I began volunteering to be a non-paid photographer at the Daily News, and later gave that up to volunteer at A Better Way (a shelter for abused women and children.) While studying abroad in Mexico one summer, I did community service with the children of Cuentepec, Mexico. It was after this experience that I knew for sure that I would be joining the Peace Corps to help the children of Latin America, a passion that was blossoming in my heart. Currently I volunteer with children at ECHO (Exploited Children s Help Organization), and I m just waiting for July 23 `' to toll around so I can head off to Ecuador with the Peace Corps. Over 9, 000 children die every year in Ecuador from preventable diseases. I plan to work to decrease this number by as much as possible. But just because I m not getting a job at a newspaper or magazine upon graduation doesn t mean I m putting my camera down to rest. I plan on beefing up my portfolio by documenting my service in Ecuador through photography. Upon my return from Ecuador, I hope to be a photographer for a non-profit organization. This way, I am continuing my dreams of serving others through my career in photojournalism. The following thesis contains my photo resume as well as my service resume. You will find information about my trip to Mexico, as well as my Peace Corps motivation and information on the Peace Corps organization. I have also included a paper on my photography mentor, Henri Cartier-Bresson, as well as numerous examples of my own photography. In our day and age, peace is something that gets talked about very idealistically. The world has never been at peace as a whole since human civilization has been in existence. Greed and power are vexations that seem to never disappear from human nature, but without those attempting to rid of these vices, we will never accomplish this dream of a happy, healthy, peaceful world. The following is a portrait of a peacemaker. Honors CollegeThesis (B. A. ...|$|R
