5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa on September12. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic basin with minimal deep convection. By September23, it reached the eastern Pacific Ocean and began increasing in shower and thunderstorm activity over the next few days. While located near Acapulco another burst in convection occurred on September25, likely due to interaction with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Around that time, the National Hurricane Center began Tropical Weather Outlooks (TWOs) on the system, which is information issued every six hours on significant areas of disturbed weather and their potential <b>for</b> <b>development</b> out to 48hours. The tropical wave split on September26, with the northern portion moving northwestward near the southwestern coast of Mexico. By September27, the system had organized deep convection and was producing tropical storm force winds, but data from scatterometers indicated that it lacked a closed circulation. Although TWOs issued on September27 predicted a high probability <b>for</b> <b>development,</b> the chances for tropical cyclogenesis was decreased later that day, due to the system's close proximity to land.|$|E

The DRECP also aimed to preserve 4.2million acres of land.

5|$|Hurricane Carlotta was {{the most}} {{powerful}} hurricane of the 2000 Pacific hurricane season. The third tropical cyclone of the season, Carlotta developed from a tropical wave on June 18 about 270miles (470km) southeast {{off the coast of}} Mexico. With favorable conditions <b>for</b> <b>development,</b> it strengthened steadily at first, followed by a period of rapid deepening to peak winds of 155mph (250km/h) on June 22.
