Comedian Peter Kay said: [...] "It's very sad news. He {{was one of}} a kind and now he has gone <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be no one else like him.

[...] Brian Tetlow, chairman of the Bolton and District Civic Trust, said: [...] "He's unique, not just to Bolton but to Britain and the world. Our thoughts are with his wife and children." ...|$|E
500|$|In an interview, Pharrell Williams {{stated that}} [...] "Billie Jean" [...] {{was one of}} his {{favorite}} songs. [...] "It is hard to say if there is a greater song than [...] "Billie Jean". <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> never be a song like this one again, with this bassline, with this kind of effect, this eternalness, this perfection." [...] The song has featured in the film Charlie's Angels and the 2002 video game [...] When re-released as part of the [...] campaign in 2006, [...] "Billie Jean" [...] charted at No. 11 in the UK.

"I {{think there}} is an {{obligation}} for the chairman and members of the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission to ask Lord Fraser to see them and testify under oath – it's that serious. Fraser should have said this at the time and, if not then, he was under a moral obligation to do so before the trial at Zeist. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be all sorts of consequences," [...] Dalyell declared.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course not," [...] 'Frisco Kid answered. [...] "And with Nelson {{and his two}} men an' French Pete, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>'ll</b> be {{any need}} for you anyway." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will try}} not to get into scrapes, Miss Kate," [...] Reuben said. [...] "I don't do it often, you know, and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be much chance of it, here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Leo to me nervously in {{the silence}} that followed, and {{speaking}} in English, [...] "now I wish we were somewhere else, for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be trouble." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{vice-chairman}} of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, Philip Hammond, said {{he wanted}} all football fans to boycott the magazine, saying, [...] "I am going to write to every fanzine in the country – including Liverpool F.C.'s – telling them to ban FHM. People are very upset by it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be a real boycott." [...] He added {{it would be like}} making jokes about the 2002 Bali bombings, in which eight fewer Australians were killed. The publication was finally discontinued in 2016, for unrelated reasons.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2014, Robinson, {{was sacked}} by Yorkshire for [...] "unprofessional actions"; in the 2014 season, {{he had made}} 7 T20 Blast {{appearances}} for Yorkshire, taking 6 wickets. Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie said of the situation that [...] "When a player consistently displays behaviour that isn’t professional, {{there has to be}} a point in time when you say ‘look, this isn’t really working, you’re obviously not that bothered about playing for the club’. That point came, and it was tough." [...] and that [...] "He’s got to learn about his game and about being a professional sportsman. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be a future for him in the professional game, but I think he needs to learn a lot, and I think he can do it." [...] Later in the 2014 season, Robinson made 1 List A appearance for Hampshire.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is quite}} possible, mademoiselle; {{we do not}} pretend to be invincible, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be some tough {{fighting}} first." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Listen to the drums!' said Wali Dad. 'That is {{the heart}} of the people--empty and making much noise. How, think you, will the Mohurrum go this year? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be trouble.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The chances are, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> that <b>there</b> <b>will</b> {{be another}} dissolution. If they {{hold their own}} against Mr. Monk's motion, then they will pass an Irish Reform Bill. After that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they must dissolve." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{a regular}} young wildcat, Desmond. She very nearly got my hand in her mouth, and if she had she would have bitten a piece out. Well, <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be any more of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was {{to satisfy}} my own mind,' she said, {{colouring}} a little. 'I didn't want any one {{to act on}} it. Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be no occasion.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Come and see, Lily, for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> {{be enough}} to reserve a fresh lot of things for Miss Hacket's affair. By-the-by, Regie, did you say it rained at Darminster?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With {{the holy}} Tanofir, Master, until I fetch her, {{training}} {{her younger sister}} to be a diviner's worthy Cup. Only perhaps I shall never send, seeing that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be fighting soon." ...|$|E

5000|$|In August 2008, {{when asked}} if any efforts would be made to get {{additional}} federal money for the project, U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley said [...] "Not by this senator, and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be any by other senators." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Or an archbishopric or two?" [...] said Julius. [...] "The pony can do it, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> as <b>there</b> <b>will</b> {{be a long}} rest. If {{he seems}} fagged, I can put up at Backsworth and take a fly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} are,--and so will I and Louey. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be room: {{it is so}} large. There is a cab for all the things. Dear Emily, I am {{so glad to see}} you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{for those}} who work in it; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be {{something}} {{coming out of it}} for Sarah,--something, but it will be very small. And if so, she must depend for it solely on Mr Rubb." ...|$|E
6000|$|Coulthurst banged {{his hand}} down on the table. [...] "Then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be an end of the trouble--and the affair could be {{arranged}} to meet your views. But however did you find {{the way into the}} Westerhouse country?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They were {{a strong}} body, but how strong I could not tell. A hundred Prussians marching will {{make as much}} noise as five hundred Frenchmen, but even {{allowing}} for that <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be at least one strong battalion, perhaps more." ...|$|R
6000|$|After {{fishing for}} a month, Ben Tripper said one Friday evening, [...] "We will {{run up to}} Leigh to-morrow and spend Sunday at home. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> we shall lose much, for the weather looks bad, and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be any fishing to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By the way, Hartington, I {{have reason}} to believe that you were right that that blow you luckily escaped was meant for me. However, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be any {{recurrence}} of the matter; in fact, I may say that I am sure there won't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You needn't puzzle {{your brain}} over that," [...] I {{answered}} gloomily, [...] "for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> soon {{be a few}} more skeletons in this beastly cave, that's all. Don't you see that those Abati will believe we are burned in the palace?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “One cannot foresee everything, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> not {{be another}} {{display of the}} kind,” he said. “Well, I will make an admission. Would it astonish you to hear that, {{in spite of the}} sentence, it was not {{intended}} that you should face the firing party?” ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be {{the most}} {{extraordinary}} effort ever made to carry New York for Douglas. You and all others who write me from your State think the effort cannot succeed, and I hope you are right. Still, it will require close watching and great efforts on the other side.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quiet, {{as far as}} we were concerned. Of course, {{there have}} been a few trifling risings along the {{frontier}} but, as a whole, even the Zakka-Khels have been quiet. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be any trouble, on a large scale, for some time to come." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, Crispin Gray stated, [...] "I wouldn't {{rule out}} {{some kind of}} reunion gigs in the future. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be another record from Queenadreena though, I would be very {{surprised}} myself. I haven't heard from Katie in well over a year and I don’t know where she is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We must be up an {{hour before}} daybreak; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be work for us tomorrow. If Unser and his tribe fail in {{capturing}} the temple we are to try; and <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be preparations to make." [...] And he explained the plan upon which he had determined.|$|R
60|$|What I chiefly {{propose to}} do to-night is to lay before you {{an account of}} the nature of the {{discovery}} which Harvey made, and which is termed the Discovery of the Circulation of the Blood. And I desire also, with some particularity, to draw your attention to the methods by which that discovery was achieved; for, in both these respects, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be much matter for profitable reflection.|$|E
6000|$|... "I quite think so, Colonel. You see, {{the facts}} will all {{come out at}} the coroner's inquest, and, when they do so, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be {{a good deal of}} strong feeling in the place if it is found that young Wyatt has been killed while bravely trying to capture Faulkner's murderer, {{while at the same time}} our warrant for his {{apprehension}} for the murder was still in force." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is nature," [...] she said. [...] "It {{is to be}} expected, {{and will}} on that account be the less grievous {{because it has been}} expected. I shall have to devote myself to those Carroll children. I {{sometimes}} think that the work of the world should not be made pleasant to us. What profit will it be to me to have done my duty by you? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be some profit if I am good to my cousins." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "You {{never say}} never. but I am very, very {{comfortable}} in the position I’m in with Lucha Underground. I love their schedule, I love their style, I love {{what they have to}} offer. <b>I</b> don’t <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> ever be another company that has what Lucha Underground has. It’s very unique, exciting, and fresh—this is really something new." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} write {{a line to}} the 'Squire, saying that you're ready to go bail, <b>I</b> do not <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be any {{necessity}} of troubling you again to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} I can't {{give you any}} advice whatever, René, it is {{certainly}} horribly unpleasant being obliged to fight in a cause you detest, but <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be a very great deal of fighting till an assault is made on the city, and when that begins, I should say the Communists will be too busy to look for absentees from the ranks." ...|$|R
