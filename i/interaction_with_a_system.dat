40|$|Abstract. The present work {{is devoted}} to the {{investigation}} of the interaction between vortices (topological defects) and site-impurities (structural defects) in the 2 D XY model and its influence on the well-known properties of the pure system. The main goal is a theoretical description of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) temperature reduction by quenched non-magnetic impurities, based on the vacancyvortex interactions and the vortex-pair dissociation mechanism of the transition. The non-magnetic impurity <b>interaction</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> of vortices can be found either from the phenomenological theory of topological defects or from the Villain model.

This paper explores the influence specific cognitive factors may have on UX qualities to be used as adaptivity factors for personalizing and improving users’ experiences in commercial Web-sites. A user experience evaluation was conducted where 96 students navigated in an existing commercial Web-site for a problem-based task. A user experience measurement was performed so as to assess users’ perceptions regarding the pragmatic, hedonic and attraction qualities of the environment. It has been observed that specific cognitive factors have considerable influence on specific qualities of user experience. To this end, such findings are encouraging for further investigation of the possible impact of cognitive factors in terms of enhancing the personalization process of commercial Web-sites so as to achieve better user experience...|$|E
