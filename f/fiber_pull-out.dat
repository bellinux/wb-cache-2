50|$|The {{fracture}} toughness of carbon fiber reinforced plastics {{is governed by}} the following mechanisms: 1) debonding between the carbon fiber and polymer matrix, 2) <b>fiber</b> <b>pull-out,</b> and 3) delamination between the CFRP sheets. Typical epoxy-based CFRPs exhibit virtually no plasticity, with less than 0.5% strain to failure. Although CFRPs with epoxy have high strength and elastic modulus, the brittle fracture mechanics present unique challenges to engineers in failure detection since failure occurs catastrophically. As such, recent efforts to toughen CFRPs include modifying the existing epoxy material and finding alternative polymer matrix. One such material with high promise is PEEK, which exhibits {{an order of magnitude}} greater toughness with similar elastic modulus and tensile strength. However, PEEK is much more difficult to process and more expensive.|$|E
40|$|Fiber-reinforced {{plastics}} (FRPs) {{are typically}} difficult to machine {{due to their}} highly heterogeneous and anisotropic nature {{and the presence of}} two phases (fiber and matrix) with vastly different strengths and stiffnesses. Typical machining damage mechanisms in FRPs include series of brittle fractures (especially for thermosets) due to shearing and cracking of matrix material, <b>fiber</b> <b>pull-outs,</b> burring, fuzzing, fiber-matrix debonding, etc. With the aim of understanding the influence of the pronounced heterogeneity and anisotropy observed in FRPs, ``Idealized'' Carbon FRP (I-CFRP) plates were prepared using epoxy resin with embedded equispaced tows of carbon fibers. Orthogonal cutting of these I-CFRPs was carried out, and the chip formation characteristics, cutting force signals and strain distributions obtained during machining were analyzed using the Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique. In addition, the same procedure was repeated on Uni-Directional CFRPs (UD-CFRPs). Chip formation mechanisms in FRPs were found to depend on the depth of cut and fiber orientation with pure epoxy showing a pronounced ``size effect.

Then with increasing loading cycles, the energy dissipation capacity of concrete turns smaller or even disappears at the final loading stage.

40|$|A major {{result of}} the use of the double {{cantilever}} beam test to provide a measure of the interlaminar fracture energy in composites subjected to simple Mode I-type loading is the observation that increasing the toughness of the matrix resin by as much as a factor of 20 produced a major (approximately four-fold) increase in interlaminar fracture energy. The data presently analyzed show that, with brittle polymers, resin toughness is fully transferred to the composite, while in the case of tougher polymers the resin toughness is only partially transferred due to the fibers' restriction of the crack tip deformation zone in the polymer, together with their changing of local stress field details.

The short CFRP materials were used for a recycled CFRP which fabricated by the following process: the CFRP, consisting of epoxy resin with carbon fiber, is injected to a rectangular plate cavity after mixing with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene resin with different weight fractions of CFRP. The fatigue and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) increased with increasing CFRP content. These correlations, however, break down, especially for tensile strength, as the CFPR content becomes more than 70 %.
