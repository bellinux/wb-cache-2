However, attempts to embark his 3,000 men ended in chaos; with only 1,200 men managing to board because of a shortage of boats and the artillery taking up an unexpected amount of space on board.

5|$|The 2/10th {{remained}} in Syria until January 1942 when, after having endured a <b>freezing</b> <b>cold</b> winter that included snow, it was transported back to Palestine {{in preparation for}} a return to Australia. Following Japan's entry into the war the previous December, and in light of Allied reverses in the Pacific, the Australian government had requested the return of some of its forces in order to bolster the defence of Australia due to concerns about a possible invasion. The 2/10th subsequently embarked on the Dutch passenger ship, Nieuw Amsterdam, bound for Australia in early February 1942. Stopping over in Bombay, the battalion was transferred to the transport Nevassa on which they continued the journey to Adelaide where they arrived in late March, after which a period of reorganisation and training followed around Kilcoy in Queensland, before the battalion was committed to its next campaign: New Guinea. Following Japanese landings on the north coast of New Guinea in July, Australian forces in the area had been fighting a desperate holding action, which had seen them being pushed inexorably towards Port Moresby. By early August 1942, the situation for the Australians was critical.|$|E

30|$|Definition 2. When we {{consider}} a variable, in general, it takes numbers as its value. If the variable takes linguistic terms, {{it is called}} linguistic variable (Zadeh 1975; Buckley 1985). The concept of a linguistic variable is very useful to describe situations that are complex or not well defined in conventional quantitative expressions.

From November to March, frost is very frequent, and the city, being {{at the bottom of}} a valley, is frequently subject to temperature inversion, in which the mountains are sunny and warm, and the plain is <b>freezing</b> <b>cold</b> and cloudy. Snow is quite common, although usually short-lived and light. Summer temperatures often exceed , with sometimes violent thunderstorms.|$|E
25|$|Bucharest {{was shaken}} {{by a series}} of crimes {{committed}} {{in the latter half of}} 1970 and the first months of 1971.

He struck after midnight during unusual weather conditions such as snowstorms, driving rain, high winds, <b>freezing</b> <b>cold</b> or fog. Many women would not go outside after 9:00 pm except in large groups or with men. Their terror was heightened by the police's reluctance to release details, leading to wildly exaggerated rumors. After a few crimes, the police realized that they were dealing with a serial killer; a yearlong investigation, with the help of victims who had survived, led to Rîmaru's arrest on May 27, 1971.|$|E

25|$|A {{handsome}} young prince {{lives in a}} luxurious castle in France. He has everything he ever wanted, and as a result, he is spoiled, selfish and unkind. One night, his kindness is {{put to the test}} when a beggar woman comes to the castle and asks for shelter from the <b>freezing</b> <b>cold,</b> with a single rose as payment. When he shuns the beggar for her repulsive appearance, she then reveals her true form as a beautiful enchantress. Seeing her beauty and realizing her power, the Prince tries to apologize but she transforms him into a terrifying beast-like creature for his arrogance. She also casts a spell on the entire castle, transforming it into a dark, foreboding place, its lush green grounds into dangerous immortal wolf-infested woods, and the good-natured servants into anthropomorphic household objects to reflect their different personalities. Ashamed of his new appearance, the Beast conceals himself inside his castle with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world, and an enchanted rose that would act as the curse's timer which would bloom until he turns 21. If the Beast could learn to love a woman and earn her love in return before the final petal fell off the rose, the curse would be broken, but if not he would remain a beast forever. The Beast turns to despair as the years pass by, with little hope of achieving this.|$|E
