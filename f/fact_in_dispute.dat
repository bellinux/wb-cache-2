Furthermore, the court ruled that the ‘355 patent was invalid under 35 U.S.C. § 102 and the asserted claims of the ‘359 patent were invalid under 35 U.S.C. § 103.

5000|$|The {{use of an}} {{advisory}} jury {{is derived from the}} practice of the Court of Chancery of referring issues of fact to one of the Common Law Courts of Westminster be tried by a jury as a feigned issue. The feigned issue was to inform the conscience of the court, and could be disregarded by the Chancellor. The feigned issue was a legal fiction by stating that a wager contract was laid between two parties interested in respectively maintaining the affirmative and the negative of certain propositions. The Gaming Act 1845 section 19 abolished the feigned issue and provided that the issue should the directly state the question of <b>fact</b> <b>in</b> <b>dispute</b> instead of a wager. The same abolition occurred in New York by section 72 of the Field Code in 1850.In Watt v Starke [...] (1879) the United States Supreme Court stated [...] "the verdict of a jury upon an issue out of chancery is only advisory." [...] Federal Equity Rule 23, effective 1913, provides in an equity case when a question arises that is triable by jury, a jury trial is held on the equity side without transfer to the law side of the United States District Court. In 1938 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 39(c)(1) authorized the in any action not triable of right by a jury the court on motion or on its own may have any issue tried by {{an advisory}} jury.|$|E

He is credited with nearly capturing Joseph Bonaparte, brother of Napoleon, after the Battle of Vittoria. [...] Joseph escaped, but Captain Edwardes souvenired a set of razors, a carriage clock and some other personal items from his carriage, which are still held by descendants of the family. Captain David Edwardes served in the Royal Horse Artillery with Captain Henry Forster (1789-1855) of Southend, Kent. Following their return to England after the Battle of Waterloo, David Edwardes married Henrys’ sister Caroline Forster. Henry Forster went on to marry Elizabeth Fitzgibbon and his grandson become Henry William Forster (First and Last Baron Forster, Governor-General of Australia).Captain David John Edwardes had a brother, Captain Henry Lewis Edwardes J.P.

Captain Henry Lewis Edwardes Gwynne went on to become High Sheriff of Cardigan in 1832. [...] He is occasionally referred to as Edward Gwynne in some texts, due to confusion over his name change.

40|$|The American Heritage Dictionary {{defines the}} {{relevant}} terms as follows: Circumstantial: 1. Of, relating to, or dependent on circumstances. 2. Of no primary significance; incidental. 3. Complete and particular; full of detail. 4. Full of ceremonial display. Pomp and circumstance. Circumstantial evidence: n. Law. Evidence not bearing {{directly on the}} <b>fact</b> <b>in</b> <b>dispute</b> but on various attendant circumstances from which the judge or jury might infer the occurrence of the <b>fact</b> <b>in</b> <b>dispute.</b> Evidence: 1. A thing or things helpful in forming a conclusion or judgement. 2. Something indicative; an outward sign. videnced, -dencing, -dences. 1. To indicate • clearly; exemplify or prove. 2. To support by testimony, attest. 3. Plainly visible, to be seen. I am interested in the photographic implications of these terms. This work contains evidence collected {{through the lens of}} the camera. Its sense of reality and immediacy is an illusion promoted by the detailed rendering capabilities of the mechanical process of photography. The photographs appear factual, but in addition to their representation of the physical world, they reveal the photographer 2 ̆ 7 s opinion. As the photographer, I attempt to influence the viewer 2 ̆ 7 s interpretation of the image. The people, {{who may or may not}} appear, have created the environments in these photographs. When photographed, these environments seem to offer circumstantial visual evidence about the lives of the people who created them. The objects shown may have been selected and displayed without regard for meaning, or with an intent that is different from the one communicated. I have tried to either emphasize the implied meaning, reinterpret it, or effect a combination of the two. Places, people and things provide the evidence of their own existence through their depiction. Any conclusions drawn are inferred through the image. While it can be used as a fact-finding medium, photography as art goes beyond the veracity of detailed representation to its underlying symbolic implications. Taking into consideration the dual photographic properties of scientific fact-finding and artistic interpretation, the resulting visual information embodies both knowledge and puzzlement. After arriving at a conclusion, an engaging photograph continues to present unanswerable questions. These are not intended as strictly factual documents, rather, they are personal observations made with an interest in such diverse human qualities as conflict, humor, love, greed, tedium, perseverance and so on. While using the highly subjective elements, poetry and beauty, in conjunction with formal elements such as suspension of time, quality of light, the edges of the frame, rhythm, repetition, emphasis, form, and symbolism, I hope to make images that evoke the layered meanings of the subject at hand. I have attempted to provide insight while leaving behind engaging questions. This work comprises several interwoven themes. The connecting thread leads through modem western society and its various configurations. Within our social structure, children symbolize the present as well as the future. Their methods of play and interpretation of the adult world are of interest here. As are the houses we live in, the gardens we make, and the products we buy, in general, the ways in which we project our perceived identities. These photographs present details of our lives that are simultaneously mundane and significant. It is a personal view of people interacting with their environments. I am drawn to the contradictions, incongruity, juxtapositions and formal beauty in varying combinations that call into question the meaning of things...|$|E

40|$|L'auteur expose les pratiques et les procédures établies pour assurer le fonctionnement efficace du C. C. R. T. ainsi que le système utilisé pour mesurer le rendement des opérations de cet organisme. Every labour {{relations}} board {{must have a}} case management System which is suited to its own specific circumstances. In {{the case of the}} Canada Labour Relations Board (C. L. R. B.), it must take into consideration the specific enabling statute, the requirements of a vast geographical dispersion of employers and employees (involving a constant necessity for hearings in remote areas) and the facility to provide service in both official languages — simultaneously when necessary. The jurisdiction of the Board covers operations in the Yukon and Northwest Territories which would normally be under provincial jurisdiction as well as such diverse activities as broad-casting, communications, international and interprovincial transportation of goods and passengers by land, sea or air, grainhandling, uranium mining, longshoring and various Crown corporations such as Canada Post, DEVCO, National Arts Centre and Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation. The C. L. R. B. has regional offices in Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montréal and Halifax staffed by officers who investigate and mediate cases as well as providing information and processing submissions made by parties. These offices are link-ed to the Board in Ottawa by electronic equipment for the transmission of documents. In some cases the employer may be located {{in one part of the}} country while the union headquarters may be in another part of the country and a case could involve such things as an unlawful strike in an entirely different location. In many cases, particularly those involving the acquisition or termination of bargaining rights decisions are made without the conduct of a public hearing. This is accomplished by the report of an investigation officer. Copies of the report of the officer are made available to the parties and they are invited to make written submissions including any challenge they might have as to the accuracy of the report. In certification cases and some other situations, there is a confidential report on the wishes of the employees. This includes verification of union membership cards and a check on the money collected which is traced from receipt of bank deposit. There are spot checks to verify that employees signed of their own free will and where there are any allegations of impropriety there is a more detailed investigation conducted. This information on the wishes of the employees is protected by legislation, but all other material on the files must be provided to the parties in order to ensure that there is no denial of natural justice. Where there are matters of <b>fact</b> <b>in</b> <b>dispute</b> between the parties the Board must conduct public hearings, allow the introduction of evidence and provide for cross examination of witnesses. In 1980, 92 % of all certification cases were disposed without conducting a public hearing. This was possible on the basis of the investigation officers' report and the written submissions of the parties. In certification and similar cases, the Board requires the employer to post notices to employees who may be affected and they may submit interventions to the Board. In some cases dealing with bargaining rights it is necessary for the Board to conduct a secret ballot to determine the wishes of the employees. In national bargaining units and even interprovincial units such as telephone communications, this can involve employees at hundreds of locations widely dispersed. It involves in some cases employees who may be at sea or in the air beyond our national boundaries. Mailed ballots are required in some of these situations. In cases involving complaints of unfair labour practices or unlawful strike or lock-out applications, the Board is obliged to conduct hearings and provide full opportunity for defence before making a finding that a person has acted in violation of the statute. However, many of these cases are settled without a hearing as a result of the mediation provided by officers of the Board. Apart from providing solutions acceptable to the parties an effective mediation program can save considerable time and money which would otherwise be required for travelling and hearing of cases. The Board does not, however, permit any mediation as to the composition of bargaining units lest such a practice should result in employees being denied the benefits of the legislation as a result of their rights being traded away in a compromise solution to differences between the parties. The Board does not delegate the authority to determine who is an employee within the meaning of the legislation or what employees should be included in or excluded from a bargaining unit. The Board is also required to conduct a public hearing before imposing a first collective agreement upon a referral of a dispute from the Minister of Labour. It is up to the Minister of Labour in the first instance to refer such questions to the Board. Upon referral, the imposition of a first collective agreement and its provisions are at the discretion of the Board. Scheduling of hearings in all parts of the country poses significant problems for the CLRB. It is not always possible to determine from the material on file the length of time that may be required to hear a particular case. If a case runs longer than expected an adjournment could make it expensive for the Board to return to the same part of the country for a continuation and hearings have to be scheduled so as to provide the parties with reasonable time to make travel and other arrangements except in the most pressing of cases. Before the commencement of a hearing the Board may conduct a meeting with counsel or principal representatives of the parties to discuss and identify the issues that are agreed upon and those in dispute and the procedures to be followed. This usually results in co-operation of counsel to expedite the hearing. If however it is not possible to complete the hearing in the time allotted without a denial of natural justice, the Board may be able to hear all the evidence and later dispose of the case as a result of written arguments submitted by the parties. The Board has to keep careful control of its case load in order to ensure the fastest possible disposition of cases. Priority is given to cases involving continuing loss. Unlawful strike or lock-out applications and cases involving dismissals normally have high priority. However, an unlawful strike application may lose its priority as a result of a resumption of work or successful mediation. This may mean that the schedule may be altered and other cases moved up for hearing. The Board has a complex System of case control and performance measurement. Weekly reports on priority cases are revised when any changes occur and monthly reports on the disposition of cases are carefully analyzed. In addition the Board measures performance by analyzing the time it takes to acknowledge and transmit each individual case; the time taken to investigate or mediate, to schedule, to hear and to issue a decision and convey it to the parties. These figures are prepared by regions and by types of cases, and are constantly studied to ensure that no avoidable delays occur and that the whole System is constantly sensitive to the need for the promptest possible disposition of cases that is consistent with the strict observance of the requirements of natural justice. These figures are examined by regional directors and their staff and are discussed by the Registrar at meetings with the regional directors and at other staff meetings. The CLRB has the advantage of external evaluation of its performance by many outside observers. Organizations of unions and employers, the legal profession, the academic community and such organizations as the Law Reform Commission are not hesitant to examine and question the operations or decisions of the Board and to prepare briefs or conduct studies on general or very particular matters which may range from proposals to amend the legislation to specific complaints regarding procedures, practices or decisions. These collectively provide a very valuable reflection of the observations of those who are interested in the whole process and knowledgeable of industrial relations...|$|E

Arguments may differ in terms of the effort needed to communicate them, the confidence they achieve, and requirements on knowledge of the audience, which makes their relative benefit task- and context-dependent. 1...|$|R

40|$|Before any dispute can be {{adjusted}} or decided {{it is necessary to}} ascertain the actual points at issue between the disputants. Conceivably this may be done in several ways. Perhaps the simplest is a process of direct questioning of the parties by the arbitrator or judge. Another method is the exchange of written statements in advance of a direct hearing of the parties. Under our Anglo-American system of legal procedure we are committed by tradition and history, by present practice and, probably, by general inclination, except in exceptional cases, to the latter method. Our system calls for the development of issues by the parties themselves in formal manner in advance of the actual trial. This is accomplished by requiring the serving on the opposing party or the filing in court alternately by the parties of pleadings - written instruments wherein are set forth the statements and contentions of each as to the points and <b>facts</b> <b>in</b> <b>dispute.</b> These pleadings are to be distinguished from the lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s oral argument or 2 ̆ 2 plea 2 ̆ 2 made to the court or jury at the trial of the case.
