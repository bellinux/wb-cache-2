Salt cementation continued to be the main method of parting until the 16th century but in later Middle Ages processes using sulfur, antimony and mineral acids began to be used. There are archaeological finds at sites in London of distillation vessels for making acids in Britain from the 15th century which include fragments of ceramic cucurbits (vessels for heating reacting chemicals) which were used with alembics for distillation. By the 18th century cementation was rarely used and had been replaced by acid treatment. Into modern times the acid parting method continued to be used but other methods were discovered. In 1860's Australia the Miller process was developed, this removed silver by bubbling chlorine gas through the molten gold mixture.

5|$|Selenium is most {{commonly}} produced from selenide in many sulfide ores, {{such as those}} of copper, nickel, or lead. <b>Electrolytic</b> metal <b>refining</b> is particularly productive of selenium as a byproduct, obtained from the anode mud of copper refineries. Another source was the mud from the lead chambers of sulfuric acid plants, a process that is no longer used. Selenium can be refined from these muds by a number of methods. However, most elemental selenium comes as a byproduct of refining copper or producing sulfuric acid. Since its invention, solvent extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW) production of copper produces an increasing share of the worldwide copper supply. This changes the availability of selenium because only a comparably small part of the selenium in the ore is leached with the copper.|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} study is to develop a {{feasible}} process for extracting gold and silver from an electrolytic zinc refinery residue. Composite samples of <b>electrolytic</b> zinc <b>refining</b> lead-silver residues containing traces of gold (1. 35 g/t) and significant amounts of silver (155 g/t) were subjected to batchwise cyanide leaching to assess the feasibility of extracting gold and silver. This project was concluded with a recommendation that a pilot Residue Leach Plant should be commissioned to beneficiate gold and silver from the residue dam for a better estimation of lime, cyanide consumptions and gold and silver recoveries. The return on capital investment will be high at current gold price and operational cost is low.

Heavy deformation was introduced in the samples after a considerable number of ECAP passes from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, to 16. The principal changes were introduced in the first pass by ECAP but a gradual increment in the mechanical properties was observed for the consecutive ECAP passes.

50|$|Metal mining {{also became}} {{significant}} industry during this period. The International Nickel Company (Inco) {{was established in}} 1902 through the fusion of two companies. A refinery using the Orford process was built in Port Colborne, Ontario in 1918 and then moved to Copper Cliff, Ontario, where that technique {{was replaced by the}} matte flotation process in 1948. Hard rock gold mining became practical in 1887, with the development of the potassium cyanidation process, by Scott MacArthur, which was used to separate the gold from the ore. This technique was first used in Canada at the Mikado Mine in the Lake-of-the-Woods Region again made accessible by the CPR. The CPR also provided access to the B.C. interior, where lead, copper, silver and gold ores had been discovered in the Rossland area in 1891. The ores were transported to Trail, B.C., where they were roasted. After CPR built the Crowsnest Pass it purchased the Trail roasting facility and in 1899 built a blast furnace to smelt lead ore. In 1902 the first <b>electrolytic</b> lead <b>refining</b> plant using the Betts Cell Process began operation in Trail. The Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada Ltd. was founded as a CPR subsidiary and began to develop the Sullivan Mine with its lead, zinc and silver ores, in Kimberley in 1909.|$|R
40|$|The use {{of copper}} anodes with non {{standard}} content of impurities {{for the treatment}} of waste, sulphur acid solutions that came {{as a result of the}} industrial process of <b>electrolytic</b> copper <b>refining</b> was investigated. Those solutions contain the high content of copper, nickel and arsine, and because of that, the copper anodes with high content of Ni, Pb, Sn and Sb were prepared. Examination the effect of high impurities content as well as the influence of the solution temperature on the anodes behaviour during the electrolytic process under the conditions that are the same as the industrial was the aim of this work. Obtained results clearly indicate that tested anodes could be used for the refined during the electrorefining process. Dissolution of copper anodes was not stoppage after the first appearance of the passivation region for A 1 and A 2 anodes while appearance of passivation for A 3 anode, for test duration of 72 h, was not registered. The start time of the first passivation appearance is shorter in the case of the anode with high content of all impurities, anode A 1. The first passivation occurrence was detected on higher temperature after about 29 h from the test starts. The change of chemical composition of electrolyte was monitored during electrolysis. Concentration of nickel in the working electrolyte at the end of process is increased and it corresponds to the Ni content in anodes. The copper and arsenic concentrations are decreased during the process. Arsenic passes into the anode slime, while the copper is deposited on the cathode and also passed in the slime. After the process is finished, obtained solution could be used for the nickel recover using the electrochemically or chemically methods...|$|R
50|$|Sometra {{was founded}} {{as a private}} firm in 1939 {{for the purpose of}} zinc smelting. Initially, it had three {{distillation}} furnaces, with five more added in 1948, the year it was nationalized by the new communist regime. Its initial capacity was 3000 tons of zinc per year, expanded to 4000 tons in 1946. Between 1950 and 1960, capacity was gradually expanded to 28,000 tons a year. In 1955, a unit for producing sulfuric acid was inaugurated. The unit was expanded in 1966, a year that also saw the introduction of a system for agglomerating concentrates of zinc and lead. This was the culmination of a four-year program of thorough restructuring and modernization, with the new equipment having a capacity of 30,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of lead bullion per year. The 1967-1970 period saw the introduction of an <b>electrolytic</b> lead <b>refining</b> system (capacity 24,000 tons a year); a unit for extracting metallic bismuth for technical and pharmaceutical use from anode sludge, as well as gold and silver alloys and antimony slag; a unit for zinc sulfate production; a unit for zinc and ammonium chloride production; and an air preheater. Capacity was doubled between 1975 and 1984. A second zinc and lead extraction unit, with annual capacities of 30,000 tons (zinc) and 20,000 tons (lead) went online, as well as two thermal zinc refineries and greater cadmium refining. In 1983, metallic antimony production began by extracting the metal from slag, along with sodium thioantimoniate and stibnite. In 1984, a second blast furnace began operation, so that the old components built from 1939 to 1957 were retired. Between 1985 and 1989, zinc powder production began and a system for collecting residual gases was put in place. In 1988, a 250 m high chimney was built. By 1989, the plant was annually generating 43,490 tons of sulfuric acid (against a projected capacity of 126,000 tons), 23,519 tons of electrolytic lead (below the 38,000 tons projected), 29,840 tons of pure zinc, 2,094 tons of zinc powder, 19 tons of cadmium, 29 tons of bismuth and 195 tons of antimony.|$|R

Later, Hamilton Castner improved the process aluminium manufacturing and devised the electrolysis of brine in large mercury cells for the production of chlorine and caustic soda, effectively founding the chlor-alkali industry with Karl Kellner in 1892. The next year, Paul L. Hulin patented filter-press type electrochemical cells in France. Charles Frederick Burgess developed the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>refining</b> of iron ca. 1904 and later run a successful battery company. Burgess published one of the first texts on the field in 1920.
