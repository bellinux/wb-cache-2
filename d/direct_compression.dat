40|$|AbstractObjective: <b>Direct</b> cardiac <b>compression</b> {{improves}} effective ventricular contractility. However, associated {{reductions in}} filling volumes {{and increases in}} arterial pressure occurring {{at the onset of}} <b>direct</b> cardiac <b>compression</b> limit the degree to which cardiac output is augmented. We tested the hypothesis that active preload and afterload control maximizes the hemodynamic effectiveness of <b>direct</b> cardiac <b>compression.</b> Methods and results: Studies in isolated canine hearts loaded with a computer-controlled volume servo system that mimicked heart failure were used to clearly define the hemodynamic effects of <b>direct</b> cardiac <b>compression.</b> Immediately on initiation of <b>direct</b> cardiac <b>compression,</b> ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume decreased substantially, arterial pressure increased, but stroke volume did not change significantly. When end-diastolic pressure was restored to about 20 mm Hg, stroke volume doubled; decreasing afterload resistance further increased stroke volume by about 30 %. Such load adjustments were then tested in vivo in a canine model of acute heart failure induced by coronary artery microembolizations titrated to decrease cardiac output to 33 % ± 9 % of control as end-diastolic pressure rose to 20. 6 ± 2. 2 mm Hg. <b>Direct</b> cardiac <b>compression</b> decreased end-diastolic pressure to 11. 4 ± 2. 6 mm Hg while increasing cardiac output from 0. 8 ± 0. 2 to 1. 4 ± 0. 5 L/min (to only ~ 55 % of normal). Restoring end-diastolic pressure to 19. 6 ± 2. 2 mm Hg by infusions of saline solution increased cardiac output to 1. 9 ± 0. 5 L/min. Afterload reduction (nitroprusside), while maintaining end-diastolic pressure at 19. 8 ± 1. 3 mm Hg, increased cardiac output to its baseline, 2. 8 ± 1. 1 L/min. Conclusions: <b>Direct</b> cardiac <b>compression</b> significantly improves ventricular pumping capacity and can restore cardiac output to about 60 % of normal in the setting of acute heart failure. When combined with active preload and afterload manipulations, <b>direct</b> cardiac <b>compression</b> can restore cardiac output to normal. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2000; 120 : 379 - 86...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. — Tectonic {{compression}} and tensional directions at the Miocene-Quaternary interval are {{tried to be}} determined {{on the basis of}} results obtained from the evaluation of faults in Southwestern Anatolian Miocene-Qua-ternary sediments. Faults evaluation, one of the newest structural evaluation methods; gives {{more or less the same}} re-sults with seismotectonic data. Studies carried out on Menderes and Burdur grabens showed a certain mechanism of graben formation in the areas under consideration. And it may thus be suggested that there is a compressive phase followed by a tensional one. Furthermore alternating tension and compression directions are normal to each other. Through regional studies, the following phases are determined: 1. Late Miocene-Early Pliocene compression phase: compression in NW-SE direction, and compression in NE-SW direction. 2. Pliocene graben formation: Beginning in Pliocene, the graben formation continued with N-S directed tension through late Pliocene. 3.

50|$|In {{the tablet}} {{pressing}} process, the main guideline {{is to ensure}} that the appropriate amount of active ingredient is in each tablet. Hence, all the ingredients should be well-mixed. If a sufficiently homogenous mix of the components cannot be obtained with simple blending processes, the ingredients must be granulated prior to compression to assure an even distribution of the active compound in the final tablet.

40|$|The late Eocene to Recent {{dynamics}} of the NW External Dinarides in Slovenia are described. The study {{is focused on the}} orogen-parallel NW-SE striking family of faults, which represent the main source of seismic hazard in the NW External Dinarides today. Approximately 1700 fault-slip datasets were collected at 70 locations and used for palaeostress analysis. Structural relationships observed in the field, allowed the construction of a relative chronology between the documented fault and shear joint sets, facilitating the reconstruction of their kinematic evolution and the chronology of palaeostress phases. Four post-Palaeocene stress tensor groups are documented corresponding to four distinct tectonic phases. The first phase is marked by NE-SW <b>directed</b> <b>compression</b> attributed to Late Eocene top-to-SW thrusting of External Dinarides. The second phase is characterized by NE-SW oriented tension, documented by normal slips recorded on NW-SE striking faults. This tension is interpreted as an expression of the Early to Middle Miocene back-arc extension in the Pannonian basin system that also affected the studied part of the External Dinarides. The third phase is manifested by approximately E-W oriented compression with approximately N-S oriented tension in a strike-slip stress regime, causing sinistral reactivation of NW-SE trending faults. Geodynamically, this phase can be correlated with the Late Miocene short pulse of E-W <b>directed</b> <b>compression,</b> documented in parts of the Pannonian basin system. The youngest phase is characterized by approximately N-S oriented compression and approximately E-W oriented tension in a strike-slip stress regime, which caused dextral reactivation of NW-SE striking faults.

40|$|This item is only {{available}} electronically. The Dudley Peninsula lies directly within the hinge of the Fleurieu Arc, a recess {{developed during the}} Cambro-Ordovician Delamerian Orogeny. On Dudley Peninsula, the structural grain was previously defined to bend through 50, {{as defined by the}} regional trace of the Sprigg Inlet Shear Zone. A structural analysis of the Sprigg Inlet Shear Zone revealed structural features recording two deformation events. The initial and most intense deformation resulted in top to the WNW directed transpression, which involved a dextral strike-slip component. The second deformation involved sinistral strike-slip shear and resulted in the formation of a crenulation and folded boudins along-strike. Interpretation of magnetic data from Dudley Peninsula, along with mapping on the south coast of Dudley Peninsula has revealed that the structural grain on Dudley Peninsula does not define a major (~ 50) bend as previously proposed. A slight (~ 5 - 10) bend of folds, faults and the Sprigg Inlet Shear Zone occurs between the NE coast and western part of Dudley Peninsula. This renewed interpretation is continuous with structural features on the limbs of the Fleurieu Arc, on southern Fleurieu Peninsula and western Kangaroo Island. This bend formed due to impingement of sediments onto the SE corner of the Gawler Craton during NW <b>directed</b> <b>compression.</b> The Fleurieu Arc is therefore classified as a Primary Arc, which possibly involved a small component of oroclinal bending during a late northerly <b>directed</b> <b>compression</b> active on Kangaroo Island either, late in, or post-dating {{the first phase of the}} Delamerian Orogeny.
