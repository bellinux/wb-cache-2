40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the response of common sized fiber-reinforced composites (FRCs) to different deflections due to bending forces and comparing it with stainless steel (SS) wires. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, two FRC groups with 0. 75 mm and 1. 2 mm diameters (Everstick Ortho, Stick Tech, Finland) and three SS groups with 0. 016 × 0. 022 inch, 0. 0215 × 0. 028 inch and 0. 7 mm diameters (3 M Uniteck, Monrovia, California, USA) were tested. Each group contained 10 samples that were tested according to a three point bending test. Each group was tested at deflections of 0. 5, 1 and 1. 5 mm and the data was analyzed using the repeated measure ANOVA by SPSS software (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, IBM SPSS, Inc. in Chicago, Illinois, USA). P < 0. 05 was considered as significant. Results: The highest recorded load belonged to the 1. 2 mm FRC and after that 0. 7 <b>mm</b> <b>SS</b> wire, 0. 75 mm FRC, 0. 0215 × 0. 028 inch SS wire and finally 0. 016 × 0. 022 inch SS wire. The 0. 7 <b>mm</b> <b>SS</b> wire and 0. 75 mm FRC were compared as retainers and the results showed the 0. 7 <b>mm</b> <b>SS</b> wire showed significantly higher load compared with 0. 75 mm FRC (P < 0. 05). The 1. 2 mm FRC had significantly higher load compared to 0. 0215 × 0. 028 inch and 0. 016 × 0. 022 inch SS wires (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: The results showed that the 1. 2 mm FRC group had significantly higher load compared to SS wires and other FRC groups under the 0. 5, 1 and 1. 5 mm deflections. Therefore, it can be suggested that FRC can be used as an esthetic replacement for SS wires for active and passive purposes in orthodontics...|$|R

5|$|In Quenya, the {{stressing}} of a syllable is {{predictable and}} non-phonemic (i.e. {{the meaning of}} a word never changes depending on the stress), but it is partly determined by syllable weight. Words of two syllables are stressed on the first syllable. In words of three or more syllables, the stress is on the penultimate syllable if this is heavy, otherwise on the antepenultimate syllable, i.e. the third-to-last syllable. In Quenya, heavy syllables are syllables that contain either a long vowel, a diphthong, or a cluster of two consonants (ll, ld, <b>mm,</b> <b>ss,</b> etc.). Certain combinations of consonants, e.g. ny, ry, are also regarded as heavy. Medially hy and hw are long consonants in Parmaquesta (not colloquially in Tarquesta) and a vowel before them is held to constitute a metrically long syllable. Quenya has also a secondary accent. The placement of stress and the distinction between heavy and light syllables is important in Quenya verse.|$|R

Purebred Embryos (PE) were produced from Holstein (H) and Montbeliard (M) oocytes inseminated with Holstein (H) or Montbeliard (M) semen (PE = <b>HH</b> and <b>MM</b> embryos). Crossbred Embryos (CE) were produced from Holstein (H) and Montbeliard (M) oocytes inseminated with Montbeliard (M) or Holstein (H) semen (CE = HM and MH embryos). Semen of 3 bulls of each breed were used. We performed four sessions of 32 embryos (8 <b>HH,</b> 8 <b>MM,</b> 8 HM, 8 MH) incubated individually in microwells placed under a microcamera (PrimovisionTM). Pictures were taken every 15 minutes until 192 h of development. The media and atmospheric conditions were previously described (Grimard et al., 2013). Development rates and the timing of reaching the 2, 4, 8 cells, morula and blastocyst stages were registered. Development rates of CE and PE groups were compared using the X 2 test. Fixed effects of oocyte and semen breed and crossbreeding on embryo kinetic parameters were tested by multivariate analysis taking into account the random effect of IVF session. Results and conclusion: 128 embryos were produced. The 2 cells development rate was significantly lower in the CE than in the PE group. No differences were observed for 4, 8 cells, morula and blastocyst rates (78, 1 vs 92, 2 %; 67, 2 vs 75 %; 53, 1 vs 46, 9 %; 45, 3 vs 40, 6 %; 31, 3 vs 35, 9 %, CE vs PE, respectively, p> 0, 05). The timing of development was similar in both groups (p> 0, 05).
