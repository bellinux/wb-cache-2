5000|$|Rosiglitazone was {{approved}} by the US FDA in 1999 and by the EMEA in 2000; the EMEA however required two postmarketing studies on longterm adverse effects, one for chronic heart failure and the other for cardiovascular effects. [...] The drug {{was approved}} for glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes, as measured by glycosylated <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>A1c</b> (HbA1c) as a surrogate endpoint, similar to that of other oral antidiabetic drugs. The controversy over adverse effects has dramatically reduced the use of rosiglitazone.|$|E
50|$|Bezafibrate {{improves}} {{markers of}} combined hyperlipidemia, effectively reducing LDL and triglycerides and improving HDL levels. The main effect on cardiovascular morbidity is {{in patients with}} the metabolic syndrome, the features of which are attenuated by bezafibrate. Studies show that in patients with impaired glucose tolerance, bezafibrate may delay progress to diabetes, and in those with insulin resistance it slowed progress in the HOMA severity marker. In addition, a prospective observational study of dyslipidemic patients with diabetes or hyperglycemia showed that bezafibrate significantly reduces <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>A1c</b> (HbA1c) concentration {{as a function of}} baseline HbA1c levels, regardless of concurrent use of antidiabetic drugs.|$|E
