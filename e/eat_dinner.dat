5|$|Nixon {{suffered}} a severe stroke on April 18, 1994, while preparing to <b>eat</b> <b>dinner</b> in his Park Ridge, New Jersey home. A blood clot {{resulting from the}} atrial fibrillation he had suffered for many years had formed in his upper heart, broken off, and traveled to his brain. He was taken to New York Hospital–Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan, initially alert but unable to speak or to move his right arm or leg. Damage to the brain caused swelling (cerebral edema), and Nixon slipped into a deep coma. He died at 9:08p.m. on April 22, 1994, with his daughters at his bedside. He was 81 years old.|$|E

25|$|The {{requirement}} that all cadets wishing to <b>eat</b> <b>dinner</b> {{in the mess}} hall must be present for a prayer {{was the basis for}} a lawsuit in 2002 when two cadets sued VMI over the prayer said before dinner. The non-denominational prayer had been a daily fixture since the 1950s. In 2002 the Fourth Circuit ruled the prayer, during an event with mandatory attendance, at a state-funded school, violated the U.S. Constitution. When the Supreme Court declined to review the school's appeal in April 2004, the prayer tradition was stopped.|$|E

25|$|Breakfast (quraac) is an {{important}} meal for Somalis, who often start the day with some style of tea (shahie) or coffee (qaxwa). The tea is often {{in the form of}} haleeb shai (Yemeni milk tea) in the north. The main dish is typically a pancake-like bread (canjeero or canjeelo) similar to Ethiopian injera, but smaller and thinner. It might also be eaten with a stew (maraqe) or soup. Qado or lunch is often elaborate. Varieties of bariis (rice), the most popular probably being basmati, usually serve as the main dish alongside goat or lamb. Spices like cumin, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and garden sage are used to aromatize these different rice delicacies. Somalis <b>eat</b> <b>dinner</b> as late as 9 pm. During Ramadan, supper is often served after Tarawih prayers; sometimes as late as 11 pm.|$|E
25|$|On November 13, 1905, Richards and Comstock were {{sentence}}d to the custody of a United States Marshal for six hours and a fine of $300 and half of court costs. The modest sentence may have reflected a finding {{that they did not}} intimidate settlers and that their employees were at work removing the fences. Controversially, newspaper accounts charged that Richards and Comstock took part in a victory celebration instead of serving time. The Secretary of the Interior was upset about the news and fired District Attorney Baxter and Marshal Thomas L. Mathews, the officer in charge of Richards and Comstock's six-hour sentence. In reality, during their sentence, Richards and Comstock returned to the hotel to pack, write letters, shop, <b>eat</b> <b>dinner,</b> and arrive at the train station for the 11 p.m. train to Ellsworth.|$|E

25|$|This {{vision of}} a collegiate {{university}} has increasingly fallen away. The funding for colleges did not {{keep pace with the}} growth in student numbers, with the result that only four colleges were built. In later years when there was heavy student demand for scarce accommodation in Canterbury the solution was found in building additional on-campus accommodation but not in the form of further colleges. The hopes that students living off campus would stay around to <b>eat</b> <b>dinner</b> in their colleges were not met, whilst the abolition of college amenities fees removed students' direct stake in their colleges. With the growth of specialist subject departments as well as of other university wide facilities, {{more and more of the}} role of colleges was transferred to the central university. Accommodation and catering were transferred to the centralised University of Kent at Canterbury Hospitality (UKCH).|$|E

500|$|Du Bois was {{organized}} and disciplined: his lifelong regimen was to rise at 7:15, work until 5, <b>eat</b> <b>dinner</b> {{and read a}} newspaper until 7, then read or socialize until he was in bed, invariably before 10.Lewis, pp. [...] 74, 231–232, 613. He was a meticulous planner, and frequently mapped out his schedules and goals on large pieces of graph paper. Many acquaintances {{found him to be}} distant and aloof, and he insisted on being addressed as [...] "Dr. Du Bois". Although he was not gregarious, he formed several close friendships with associates such as Charles Young, Paul Laurence Dunbar, John Hope and Mary White Ovington. His closest friend was Joel Spingarn– a white man– but Du Bois never accepted Spingarn's offer to be on a first name basis. Du Bois was something of a dandy– he dressed formally, carried a walking stick, and walked with an air of confidence and dignity. He was relatively short, standing at , and always maintained a well-groomed mustache and goatee. He enjoyed singing and playing tennis.|$|E

Because the money they had with them had been spent on clothes (NEMS was supposed to send them more), they arranged for credit over two nights in a nightclub. Evans: [...] "We took advantage of our credit standing, as money had still not arrived from England. News about Paul's [...] visit to the club the previous night had spread, and the place was jammed.

2500|$|The Russian {{delegation}} {{was led by}} Adolph Joffe who {{had already}} led their armistice negotiators, but his group was made more cohesive by eliminating most of the representatives [...] of social groups, like peasants and sailors, {{and the addition of}} tsarist general Aleksandr Samoilo and the noted Marxist historian Mikhail Pokrovsky. It still included as the representative for women Anastasia Bizenko, who had assassinated a high Imperial official. Again the negotiators met in the fortress in Brest Litovsk, while the delegates were housed in temporary wooden structure in its courtyards, because the city had been burnt to the ground in 1915 by the retreating Russian army. They were cordially welcomed by the commander of the Eastern Front, Prince Leopold of Bavaria, who sat with Joffe on the head table at the opening banquet with one hundred guests.

It seems to bring back the old feeling which is experienced where the smell of football is in the air, the first cold days of autumn and it makes me homesick, though only slightly. Ralph Henning, of Bay City, is here, and though we come from different parts of Michigan and attended different schools, he being the captain of the Michigan Aggies' football team in 1916, we quite frequently talk over the old scenes with which we are both familiar. He, too, has mentioned the feeling of football in the air. If they were to train an army of football players and throw them into the lines, the last weeks of October, with Coach Yost to address them just before the battle, we would score a touchdown the first half, and before Thanksgiving we would have pushed the Germans under their own goal posts and <b>eat</b> <b>dinner</b> in Berlin." ...|$|E
