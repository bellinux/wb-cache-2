40|$|Avoiding flange climb <b>derailment</b> is {{one main}} issue with {{ensuring}} the running safety of railway vehicles. This paper discusses the different causes {{that can lead}} to the <b>derailment</b> of a railway wheel, particularly in the light of different <b>derailment</b> criteria used by the standards or proposed by various researchers. Furthermore the paper presents two case studies, one for a vehicle with solid axles and one for a bogie with independently rotating wheels, reporting a description of the <b>derailment</b> case and discussing the causes that led to <b>derailment,</b> by making combined use of measurements and numerical simulation. Based on these exemplary cases, some conclusions are drawn concerning the validity of the <b>derailment</b> criteria presently used by the standards in force...|$|R
5|$|Several {{collisions}} {{have occurred}} on Washington Metro, resulting in injuries and fatalities, along with numerous <b>derailments</b> with {{few or no}} injuries. WMATA {{has been criticized for}} disregarding safety warnings and advice from experts. The Tri-State Oversight Committee oversaw WMATA, but had no regulatory authority. Metro's safety department is usually in charge of investigating incidents, but could not require other Metro departments to implement its recommendations. Following several safety lapses, the Federal Transit Administration assumed oversight at WMATA.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{frequent}} <b>derailments,</b> {{low speed}} meant Wotton Tramway {{had a good}} safety record. The locomotives occasionally ran over stray sheep, and on 12September1888 sparks {{from one of the}} Aveling and Porter engines blew back into one of the train's cattle trucks, igniting the straw bedding and badly burning two cows. The line had one serious accident, in which Ellen Maria Nickalls, a servant at Wotton House, was struck by a locomotive near Church Siding and killed. The coroner returned a verdict of accidental death, absolving driver James Challis.|$|E
5|$|The E60s were {{successful}} in the coal-hauling role. They ran on the BM for decades and remain in use on several mining railroads in the Western United States. The passenger variants failed in their intended role. Problems with the truck design caused <b>derailments</b> above , rendering the locomotives unusable for high-speed service. By {{the end of the}} 1970s Amtrak abandoned the E60 in favor of EMD AEM-7 locomotives manufactured by Electro-Motive Division. In Mexico, the NdeM's project was delayed into the 1990s, then scrapped after three years of use. Most of the NdeM's electric locomotives never ran and were traded back to GE for diesels. Some were sold to various mining railroads.|$|E
40|$|Although leader <b>derailment</b> is {{potentially}} costly to organizations and employees, {{the link between}} leader behaviors and <b>derailment</b> potential is unclear. Drawing on negative leadership theory, we address this {{gap in the literature}} by exploring how different leader behaviors are related to <b>derailment</b> potential and how this relationship is moderated by the organizational and cultural context. We found that leaders who exhibit low levels of decisiveness, leading employees, and straightforwardness and composure {{were more likely to be}} judged higher in <b>derailment</b> potential. Organizational level acted as a moderator, such that the relationship between these leadership behaviors and <b>derailment</b> potential was stronger for high level leaders. The national cultural value of power distance moderated these two-way interactions such that the moderating effect of organizational level in the decisiveness and leading employees-leader <b>derailment</b> potential relationship was stronger for leaders in high power distance cultures. These findings underscore the importance of contextual factors in examining leader <b>derailment</b> potential...|$|R

5|$|A {{series of}} <b>derailments</b> {{in the mid-1970s}} {{shattered}} Amtrak's confidence in the locomotive, and many railroads banned it from their tracks. Multiple investigations pointed to issues with the locomotive's trucks, {{the weight of the}} water and steam generators used for train heating, or the vibration of baggage cars behind the locomotive. In 1977 Amtrak decided to move on from the SDP40F in favor of the EMD F40PH, which was already in use on short-distance routes. Amtrak traded most of its fleet into EMD; the components were incorporated into new F40PHs. The remainder were traded to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF) for use in freight service. The Santa Fe rebuilt the locomotives and designated them SDF40-2. The Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway (BNSF), successor to the Santa Fe, retired them in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak {{announced}} in October 1976 that the North Coast Hiawatha {{would be the}} second train, after the Empire Builder, to receive the new bi-level Superliner coaches, then on order from Pullman Standard. In the end the train was cancelled before the Superliners entered long-distance service. In the spring of 1977 Amtrak added seven hours to the schedule, increasing it to 52 hours 30 minutes. The change was prompted by new speed restrictions on Amtrak trains after a rash of <b>derailments</b> involving the new EMD SDP40F diesel locomotives. In September Amtrak eliminated the off-day ChicagoSt. Paul service, leaving the North Coast Hiawatha with three trips a week. Amtrak reduced the Empire Builder to quad-weekly service as well. The Twin Cities Hiawatha returned as a daytime service between Chicago and Minneapolis.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak {{inherited}} {{an aging}} and mechanically-incompatible fleet of diesel locomotives from various private railroads on its startup in 1971. The most modern locomotives remained {{in private hands}} to operate the various commuter services which, by law, did not pass to Amtrak. To replace these Amtrak ordered 150 EMD SDP40F locomotives, which began entering service in 1973. These were supplemented by 25 GE P30CHs which entered service in 1975. The SDP40F was a troubled design; problems with weight distribution led {{to a series of}} <b>derailments</b> in the mid-1970s. Meanwhile, the poor truck design of the P30CH (and the electric GE E60CP) curtailed further orders of that unit when Amtrak found itself needing more short- and medium-distance power in the spring of 1975.|$|E

40|$|Summary: We {{conducted}} {{statistical analyses}} and used modeling techniques to develop <b>derailment</b> probabilities for freight trains and freight cars operating on North American railroads. Knowing the expected frequency of <b>derailment</b> and the conditional probabilities of <b>derailment</b> for individual cars enables {{estimation of the}} <b>derailment</b> risk as it is affected by train length, operating speed, and positioning of cars in the consist. These results {{can be used to}} quantify the benefit in terms of reduced accident probability and severity of various changes in railroad operating and safety practices...|$|R

25|$|Computer control {{eliminates}} errors {{from human}} drivers, so PRT designs {{in a controlled}} environment should be much safer than private motoring on roads. Most designs enclose the running gear in the guideway to prevent <b>derailments.</b> Grade-separated guideways would prevent conflict with pedestrians or manually controlled vehicles. Other public transit safety engineering approaches, such as redundancy and self-diagnosis of critical systems, are also included in designs.|$|E
25|$|There were no <b>derailments</b> of Shinkansen {{bullet train}} {{services}} {{in and out}} of Tokyo, but their services were also suspended. The Tōkaidō Shinkansen resumed limited service late in the day and was back to its normal schedule by the next day, while the Jōetsu and Nagano Shinkansen resumed services late on 12 March. Services on Yamagata Shinkansen resumed with limited numbers of trains on 31 March.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{assessment}} of flange climb <b>derailment</b> in bogies with independently rotating wheels, through experimental tests and numerical simulations. An extensive experimental campaign {{has been carried out}} on a full-scale test rig, allowing to induce the wheelset <b>derailment</b> under controlled conditions, of a tramcar wheelset equipped with independently rotating wheels. In parallel to the experimental tests, a numerical simulator of the test-rig was used, for the definition of the conditions to be tested in order to achieve <b>derailment,</b> and for the validation of the developed wheel/rail contact model, in extreme conditions of flange climb <b>derailment.</b> Finally a vehicle numerical simulator was adopted to extend <b>derailment</b> analysis in transient conditions, also accounting for the dynamics of the whole vehicle...|$|R
30|$|Besides, {{the wheel}} {{unloading}} ratio {{is only applicable}} to the situation that the wheel axle lateral force is zero or very small and should be used together with the <b>derailment</b> coefficient. The <b>derailment</b> evaluation by wheelset <b>derailment</b> coefficient H/Q is similar to the wheel axle force limit which is applied to evaluate the wheel–rail interactions rather than the flange climbing.|$|R
30|$|To {{analyze the}} {{mechanism}} of this third <b>derailment,</b> {{it is crucial to}} evaluate the strong ground motion at the <b>derailment</b> site with high accuracy. For this study, strong motion estimation was carried out at the <b>derailment</b> site with consideration for empirical site amplification and phase effects. First, temporary earthquake observations were conducted at the <b>derailment</b> site. Then, ground shaking characteristics at the <b>derailment</b> site were evaluated based on the obtained records. In addition, strong ground motions at the <b>derailment</b> site during the foreshock were evaluated based on the site-effect substitution method (Hata et al. 2011). The same method was also applied to estimate strong ground motions at a nearby strong motion station, where the foreshock ground motion was observed, to investigate the applicability of this method to this particular earthquake. The estimated ground motions were highly consistent with the observed ground motions, which indicate the applicability of this estimation method. Finally, the response spectra of the evaluated strong motions at the <b>derailment</b> site were compared with the design response spectrum of the Specifications for Railway Structures (Railway Technical Research Institute (RTRI) 1999) based on an effect of very soft ground (G 5 ground; RTRI 2012).|$|R
