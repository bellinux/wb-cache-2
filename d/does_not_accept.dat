5|$|Héloïse Aue (Héloïse Moreau) – Max's mother, who, believing {{her first}} husband to be dead, {{remarried}} Aristide Moreau. Max <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> that his father is dead and never forgives his mother for remarrying. Héloïse also disapproves of Max's joining the Nazis, which further strains their relationship.|$|E
5|$|Ashley is a Riskbreaker, {{a militant}} {{division}} of the VKP responsible for upholding state security and law. Although Callo accompanies him, Ashley <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> her as a combat partner due to her lack of combat experience. Callo ends up being Sydney's hostage and discovers the truth of Müllenkamp's activities. Another Riskbreaker, Rosencrantz, appears during Ashley's battles in Leá Monde, briefing him on the plans of the VKP, Sydney and the Cardinal, and subsequently his take on Ashley's past. This casts suspicion on Ashley's behalf, as Riskbreakers always work alone.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, Yelp {{invested}} in Nowait, an app that {{allows users to}} see how long {{they would have to}} wait at a restaurant that <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> reservations, as well as put their names on the waitlist without being physically present at a restaurant.

5|$|King Artaxerxes {{thinks it}} {{just that the}} cities in Asia should belong to him, as well as Clazomenae and Cyprus among the islands, and that the other Greek cities, both small and great, should be left independent, except Lemnos, Imbros, and Scyros; and these should belong, as of old, to the Athenians. But {{whichever}} of the two parties <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> this peace, upon them I will make war, in company with those who desire this arrangement, both by land and by sea, with ships and with money.|$|E
5|$|PHC {{receives}} all of {{its funding}} from tuition fees or donations. The college states that it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> any money from the government or any other source that includes terms that supersede the authority of its Board of Trustees or conflict with its foundational statements. PHC adds new facilities and programs only as funds are available. The Home School Legal Defense Association {{is one of the}} primary benefactors of the school, and all members of the association receive a $1300 grant if they are accepted as students.|$|E
5|$|According to the Instituto Nacional de Estatística (National Institute of Statistics, or Statistics Portugal), {{the city}} of Caldas da Rainha {{contains}} the entirety of Santo Onofre, most of Nossa Senhora do Pópulo (excluding the settlements of Lagoa Parceira, Imaginário, and Casal do Tanqueirão) and the southernmost portion of Tornada, but the municipal assembly <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> any portion of Tornada {{as part of the}} city. Nossa Senhora do Pópulo and Santo Onofre are separated by the Linha do Oeste (Western Line) railway line, as specified in the 1984 law (effective 1 January 1985) that carved Santo Onofre out of the civil parish that was called Caldas da Rainha at that time.|$|E

5|$|Relationships among lemur {{families}} have also {{proven to be}} problematic and {{have yet to be}} definitively resolved. To further complicate the issue, several Paleogene fossil primates from outside Madagascar, such as Bugtilemur, have been classified as lemurs. However, scientific consensus <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> these assignments based on genetic evidence, and therefore it is generally accepted that the Malagasy primates are monophyletic. Another area of contention is the relationship between the sportive lemurs and the extinct koala lemurs (Megaladapidae). Formerly grouped in the same family due to similarities in dentition, they are no longer considered to be closely related due to genetic studies.|$|E
5|$|The party {{supports}} {{an increase}} in police forces, and more visible police on the streets. It wants to implement tougher punishments, especially for crime regarding violence and morality offences. The party also wants to establish an ombudsman for victims and relatives, as it believes today's supportive concern focus {{too much on the}} criminals rather than the victims. It wants the police {{to be able to use}} more non-lethal weapons, such as electroshock weapons. It also <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> any use of religious or political symbols with the police uniform, and wants to expel foreign citizens who are convicted of crime with a frame of more than three months imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|Assisting {{communication}} {{across many}} modern optic fibre networks is a protocol known as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). The ATM protocol {{allows for the}} side-by-side data transmission mentioned in the second paragraph. It is suitable for public telephone networks because it establishes a pathway for data through the network and associates a traffic contract with that pathway. The traffic contract is essentially an agreement between the client and the network about how the network is to handle the data; if the network cannot meet {{the conditions of the}} traffic contract it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> the connection. This is important because telephone calls can negotiate a contract so as to guarantee themselves a constant bit rate, something that will ensure a caller's voice is not delayed in parts or cut off completely. There are competitors to ATM, such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), that perform a similar task and are expected to supplant ATM in the future.|$|E

5|$|Further, {{he points}} out that the {{language}} used by the Beowulf poet was already archaic, and the choice of words was at the time recognisably poetic. Tolkien gives as an example beorn, which meant both 'bear' and 'warrior', but only in heroic poetry could it be used to mean 'man'. He advises the translator to prefer 'striking' and 'smiting', and to avoid 'hitting' and 'whacking'. But on the other hand, he criticises William Morris for using the dead and unintelligible 'leeds' for OE leode ('freemen', 'people'; cf German leute), even if antiquarians feel that the word ought to have survived. Tolkien <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> the etymological fallacy either: mod means 'pride', not 'mood'; burg is 'stronghold', not 'borough', even though the modern word derives from the old one.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to dualism, monism <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> any fundamental divisions. The fundamentally disparate nature of reality has {{been central to}} forms of eastern philosophies for over two millennia. In Indian and Chinese philosophy, monism is integral to how experience is understood. Today, the most common forms of monism in Western philosophy are physicalist. Physicalistic monism asserts that the only existing substance is physical, in some sense of that term to be clarified by our best science. However, a variety of formulations (see below) are possible. Another form of monism, idealism, states that the only existing substance is mental. Although pure idealism, {{such as that of}} George Berkeley, is uncommon in contemporary Western philosophy, a more sophisticated variant called panpsychism, according to which mental experience and properties may be at the foundation of physical experience and properties, has been espoused by some philosophers such as Alfred North Whitehead and David Ray Griffin.|$|E
5|$|Similarly {{they decided}} that the United Kingdom could not {{exercise}} any judicial power over Australia, {{with the end of}} appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and the court's previous decision, in Kirmani v Captain Cook Cruises Pty Ltd (No 2) that the limited purpose of a certificate of appeal, was spent and that it would never again grant a certificate of appeal. They also decided that no executive power existed over Australia, as although the sovereign monarch of Australia and the sovereign monarch of the United Kingdom are the same person, it had been accepted {{for a long time that}} the monarch acts in Australian matters on the advice of Australian ministers, and <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> the advice of United Kingdom ministers in Australian matters at all.|$|E
