25|$|Swedish Air Force General Björn Bjuggren {{wrote in}} his memoirs how his {{squadron}} developed dive-bombing techniques in the mid-1930s for their B4s. When the Hawker engineers found out, they issued a <b>formal</b> <b>objection,</b> saying that the aircraft had not been designed for that purpose. However, the Swedish pilots proved that the aircraft {{was up to the}} task and dispelled their concerns.|$|E
25|$|In September 2011, the Trump Organization lodged a <b>formal</b> <b>objection</b> to the {{proposed}} construction of a wind farm off the Aberdeenshire coast {{not far from the}} site of the new hotel and luxury housing. Donald Trump also wrote personally to the First Minister of Scotland protesting mainly on aesthetic grounds at {{the proposed}} erection of offshore wind turbines, which he characterized as 'ugly'. His letter claimed that he was protesting on behalf of the Scottish people, 'not... merely for the benefit of Trump International Golf Links.' The Organization's subsequent lawsuit failed as did the appeal.|$|E
25|$|In Scotland {{there is}} no minimum {{residence}} requirement to contract a valid partnership. During the waiting period, the proposed partnership is publicised and anyone may make a <b>formal</b> <b>objection.</b> If there is such an objection, the proposed civil partnership cannot be formed unless the objection is withdrawn or if the registration authority is satisfied that the objection ought not to prevent {{the formation of the}} civil partnership. Provided no objection has been recorded, or any recorded objections have been cleared, the registration authority must issue a civil partnership schedule at the request of either party upon the expiration of the waiting period. The civil partnership must then be registered within twelve months of the notice first being given.|$|E
50|$|Ex parte Quayle, 25 USPQ 74, 1935 C.D. 11; 453 O.G. 213 (Comm'r Pat. 1935) is a United States {{patent law}} decision. When a patent {{application}} is in condition for allowance, prosecution {{on the merits}} is closed. At this time, further amendments of the patent application are allowed only to correct <b>formal</b> <b>objections,</b> which typically include minor and obvious mistakes. The presence of such <b>formal</b> <b>objections</b> precludes the full closing of prosecution; therefore, in these situations, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issues an Ex parte Quayle Office action requesting the applicant to correct the <b>formal</b> <b>objections.</b>|$|R

25|$|IWC is a {{voluntary}} international organization {{and is not}} backed up by treaty, therefore, the IWC has substantial practical limitations on its authority. First, any member countries are free to simply leave the organization and declare themselves not bound by it if they so wish. Second, any member state may opt out of any specific IWC regulation by lodging a <b>formal</b> <b>objection</b> to it within 90 days of the regulation coming into force (such provisions are common in international agreements, on the logic that it is preferable to have parties remain within the agreements than opt out altogether). Third, the IWC has no ability to enforce any of its decisions through penalty imposition.|$|E
25|$|In June Camarine raced {{away from}} Newmarket {{for the first}} time when she ran in the Ascot Gold Cup over two and a half miles in front of a large and {{enthusiastic}} crowd which included the King. She was ridden by James Robinson and was opposed by the six-year-old Rowton, the winner of the 1829 St Leger and The Saddler, winner of the 1831 Doncaster Cup. Rowton, ridden by Sam Chifney, made the running from The Saddler, with Camarine held up in third before Robinson moved her up to challenge for the lead in the straight. After a particularly severe contest, Camarine and Rowton crossed the line together, with the judge calling a dead heat. The older horse hung away from the rails and appeared to have hampered the filly in the closing stages; it was only with some difficulty that Wood was persuaded not to lodge a <b>formal</b> <b>objection.</b> A run-off over the same course was arranged to decide the race, and Robinson again restrained the filly in the early stages before overtaking Rowton in the straight and winning by two lengths.|$|E
25|$|Roches {{threatened}} to sue Dún Laoghaire Corporation for £1.3 million pounds, a large amount at the time, despite legal opinion that such a claim could never be substantiated. However, {{they said that they}} would withdraw this claim if they were allowed to knock down the wings. Dún Laoghaire Corporation submitted a proposal for opinion that they could demolish the wings and integrate the Pillar room into the part that was to be retained. This was rejected by the conservationists. Several groups in favour of conservation including An Taisce, Bord Fáilte, the National Monuments Advisory Council, the Old Dublin Society, the Arts Council, and the Irish Georgian Society, signed a <b>formal</b> <b>objection</b> rejecting any proposition on the part of Dún Laoghaire Corporation to permit the demolition of any part of Frescati. Several companies offered to buy the house and promised to develop the lands while preserving Frescati. One of these companies wanted to erect a residential development in the remaining land which integrated a restored Frescati. All of these offers were refused.|$|E
50|$|The station license was {{transferred}} on January 22, 2007 to Bernard Ohio LLC following a period {{under the supervision}} of a bankruptcy trustee, despite some <b>formal</b> <b>objections</b> filed with the FCC.|$|R
50|$|The scheme proved {{contentious}} {{with both}} significant opposition and support, receiving 2,772 <b>formal</b> <b>objections</b> and 1,115 in support, {{as well as}} objections from RSPB Scotland; {{in part due to}} concerns on its impact on the rare Whimbrel.|$|R

2500|$|Brett {{featured}} in the Monster Bat Incident 1771 as the bowler who led the protest; and it is almost certain that he wrote out the <b>formal</b> <b>objection</b> to Thomas White's huge bat. [...] This document, which has been preserved, was countersigned by his captain Richard Nyren and Hampshire's senior batsman John Small. [...] The protest resulted in the maximum width of the bat being set at four and one quarter inches in the Laws of Cricket.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the Resident-General's {{inquiry and}} the Korean government's {{response}} reported on July 13, daily newspapers Hwangseong Shinmun (May 9, 1906) and Daehan Maeil Sinbo (May 1, 1906) had denied the rumoured Japanese local official's claim of incorporating Liancourt Rocks. [...] "their claim to Dokdo as Japanese territory is totally groundless; {{the story is}} really shocking." [...] Although Hwangseong Shinmun had clearly declared that rumours of the Japanese incorporation of Liancourt Rocks were baseless {{two months before the}} July communication, and although the July communication reminded the Resident-General, Itou Hirobumi, of the 1900 Imperial Decree reaffirming Korea's state authority over Liancourt Rocks, {{there is no evidence that}} the then Resident-General or any other representation of Imperial Japan raised a <b>formal</b> <b>objection</b> to it.|$|E
50|$|In June 2016 Spellar {{raised a}} <b>formal</b> <b>objection</b> to a {{parliamentary}} order creating the West Midlands Combined Authority, delaying its creation, because its size had been increased since its proposal and Spellar believed its {{funding was not}} clear.|$|E
50|$|The FCC {{has also}} allowed AM {{stations}} to put broadcast translators on FM through STAs, although LPFM advocates often {{feel this is}} an abuse of process, and that there should instead be a rulemaking proceeding where <b>formal</b> <b>objections</b> can be raised.|$|R
50|$|After {{overcoming}} a <b>formal</b> <b>objections</b> {{by another}} local broadcaster, the FCC approved the deal on November 25, 2011, with the caveat that consummation {{would have to}} take place before December 1, 2011, or wait until each station's license was up for renewal. The transaction for WDBT and WESP was consummated on November 30, 2011.|$|R
5000|$|In October 2003, plans by Archer and Rostron Ltd. {{to convert}} the {{derelict}} King's Head pub into a private sex club to be re-christened Daniel's Dudes caused controversy, with over 500 local residents registering <b>formal</b> <b>objections</b> to the plan. [...] Faced with this opposition, the company dropped its proposals to open a swingers club on the site and instead converted the venue into a hotel and health spa called The Local Spa.|$|R
50|$|In November 2008 it was {{announced}} that the scheme would be delayed by at least a year due to the Financial crisis of 2007-2010. In March 2008 the Cambridge Cycling Campaign submitted a <b>formal</b> <b>objection</b> to the Northstowe planning application due to the inadequate cycling and walking provision.|$|E
50|$|Palestinian human-rights {{organization}} Al-Haq instructed {{lawyers in}} the Netherlands to submit a <b>formal</b> <b>objection</b> against the decision of Stadsregio Arnhem Nijmegen, a municipality, to award a public transport concession to Hermes, the Dutch subsidiary of Veolia Transdev. The objection was based on Veolia’s involvement in what Al-Haq claims are Israel’s violations of international law.|$|E

5000|$|Subsequent to the Experimental Order, {{the formal}} protest group No To Bike Parking Tax {{was formed to}} oppose the measures. [...] It {{presented}} <b>formal</b> <b>objections</b> to the Council's Built Environmental Policy and Scrutiny Committee on 2009-03-31. [...] It also organized several public protests, including [...] "go-slows" [...] where motorcyclists rode slowly through central London during peak [...] "rush hour" [...] traffic times causing road closures and traffic problems, in December 2008 and March 2009.|$|R
40|$|The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) {{was created}} as a {{conservation}} tool – intended to provide “the best environmental choice in seafood” to consumers and to create positive incentives that would improve the status and management of fisheries. During its 15 years, the MSC, which has {{an annual budget of}} close to US$ 20 million, has attached its logo to more than 170 fisheries. These certifications have not occurred without protest. Despite high costs and difficult procedures, conservation organizations and other groups have filed and paid for 19 <b>formal</b> <b>objections</b> to MSC fisheries certifications. Only one objection has been upheld such that the fishery was not certified. Here, we collate and summarize these objections and the major concerns as they relate to the MSC’s three main principles: sustainability of the target fish stock, low impacts on the ecosystem, and effective, responsive management. An analysis of the <b>formal</b> <b>objections</b> indicates that the MSC’s principles for sustainable fishing are too lenient and discretionary, and allow for overly generous interpretation by third-party certifiers and adjudicators, which means that the MSC label may be misleading both consumers and conservation funders...|$|R
5000|$|In July 2000, Cumulus Media Inc. (Lewis W. Dickey Jr., president) {{reached an}} {{agreement}} to sell this station to Clear Channel Communications Inc. (L. Lowry Mays, chairman) {{as part of an}} 80-station deal for a reported $166 million. [...] After multiple <b>formal</b> <b>objections</b> to this deal, it was ultimately approved by the FCC on February 21, 2002, and the transaction was consummated on April 23, 2002. At the time of the sale, the station aired a Southern Gospel music format.|$|R
50|$|In February 2011, {{following}} the government's decision to promote Gantz to Chief of the General Staff, Attorney Avi'ad Vissuli of the Forum for the Land of Israel submitted a <b>formal</b> <b>objection</b> to Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein and to Judge Ya'akov Turkel, {{demanding that the}} appointment be revoked. Vissuli compared the violations attributed to Gantz to the controversial property violations of Major General Yoav Galant.|$|E
50|$|The New Zealand government, however, intervened {{and created}} enough {{obstacles}} and delays to push Aqua Avia into insolvency. This {{was done by}} Air New Zealand filing a <b>formal</b> <b>objection</b> which was upheld by the New Zealand Airworthiness Authorities. The delays caused by this objection derailed Skybus as {{it was about to}} commence its commercial service, having taken delivery of the two Viscount aircraft in their new livery.|$|E
5000|$|On 13 September 2010, the Open Source Consortium, the UK {{trade body}} for organisations working in Open Source Software, {{submitted}} a <b>formal</b> <b>objection</b> [...] to Ofcom asking it {{to investigate the}} project. In its submission to the media regulator, the OSC said that Canvas will have [...] "adverse consequences" [...] for the device and software sector by [...] "diminishing consumer choice and causing inevitable consumer harm".|$|E
5000|$|Bloomsbury (1836 [...] - 1861) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. In {{a career}} that lasted from May 1839 to July 1841 he ran ten times and won four races. His most {{important}} win came on his first racecourse appearance {{when he won the}} 1839 Derby. He went on to win important races at Ascot and Liverpool before his retirement after his five-year-old season. He was later exported to stand as a stallion in Germany. Bloomsbury's controversial origins were the subject of two <b>formal</b> <b>objections</b> and a court case which led to a crisis in English racing.|$|R
5|$|The only {{significant}} alteration {{to the structure}} of the bridge itself since the addition of the sculptures in 1907 came in 1973, when the Greater London Council (GLC) decided to add an extra traffic lane by reducing the width of the pavements. To counter the increased load of extra traffic, the council announced the replacement of the cast-iron balustrades with low box-girder structures. Despite <b>formal</b> <b>objections</b> from both Lambeth and Westminster Councils, the GLC ignored the objections. In 2015, the extra lane of motor traffic was removed in favour of a kerb-protected two-way cycle track, on the north-east side of the bridge. This forms part of Cycle Superhighway 5.|$|R
2500|$|The {{embankment}} across Penryn Creek {{was similarly}} ill thought through. There {{was to be}} an embankment (or viaduct) with a drawbridge to pass ships to Penryn Harbour; the waterway was tidal, of course, and the sailing ships needed sea room to beat up the channel, and needed to do so {{at the top of}} the tide. Steep railway gradients were necessary either side of the crossing. Evidence was given that the obstruction by Moorsom's embankment made it quite unacceptable, and several [...] "memorials" [...] had been submitted to that effect. In his evidence at the Lords Committee, Moorsom seemed to know little of the <b>formal</b> <b>objections</b> to the scheme.|$|R
50|$|Written {{objections}} to the scheme were to be received by 21 June, after which the commission would hold meetings with existing authorities before presenting their final proposals. The only <b>formal</b> <b>objection</b> from an existing local authority was from Banstead Urban District Council, who submitted a petition with 12,000 signatures objecting to its proposed merger with the neighbouring Borough of Reigate. However, over 20,000 submissions from individuals and organisations were received.|$|E

40|$|The {{standard}} covering-law {{model of}} explanation sets forth a formal, deductive account of explanation. The account faces {{two kinds of}} <b>formal</b> <b>objections.</b> The fist {{is the problem of}} explanatory relevance. This concerns the specification of formal conditions for relevant logical derivations. The second difficulty is the problem of 2 ̆ 2 self 2 ̆ 2 -explanation. This involves specifications which govern the role that a given statement is allowed to play in an explanatory deduction of itself. A revision of the standard covering-law model provides a natural way to avoid both of these problems. And, it also has the virtue of not being an ad hoc solution...|$|R
50|$|The Australian Conservation Foundation {{has put the}} 400 million 2005 Hazelwood {{expansion}} in context by comparing it to Victoria's five-star energy efficient homes standard, {{which is expected to}} save 200000 t of greenhouse gases per annum. The ACF reasons that Hazelwood's operations would cancel out that benefit every four days. Former ACF Executive director Don Henry said he would follow <b>formal</b> <b>objections</b> with legal action to prevent the grant of 'new' coal to IPRH. Most of the West Field coal reserves were allocated to Hazelwood in 1996 in the privatisation process. The ACF did not mount any legal objection to Hazelwood's allocated coal reserves.|$|R
