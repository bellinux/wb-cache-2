The method has been improved by investigating the influence of experimental conditions. Lepidium sativum was chosen as the most suitable species, showing high germinability, good repeatability of root length measurements, and low sensitivity to seed pretreatment. DMSO was the most appropriate solvent carrier for less water-soluble compounds. Three <b>dinitrophenols</b> and three hydroxybenzonitriles were tested: dinoterb, DNOC, 2, 4 -dinitrophenol, chloroxynil, bromoxynil, and ioxynil. Toxicity was also determined using the Vibrio fischeri MicrotoxÂ® test, and a highly significant correlation was found between EC 50 values obtained by the two assays. Dinoterb was the most toxic compound. The toxicity of hydroxybenzonitriles followed the order: ioxynil >bromoxynil >chloroxynil; L. sativum exhibited a slightly higher sensitivity than V. fischeri to these compounds. A QSAR analysis highlighted the importance of hydrophobic, electronic, and hydrogen-bonding interactions, in accordance with a mechanism of toxic action based on protonophoric uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation.

It is a three-phase system, aqueous-organic-aqueous, where the organic solvent is held into the fibre pores, being {{in contact with the}} two other phases. The organic phase is formed by two different organic solvents, with two different polarities, n-undecane and toluene (1 : 1). The optimization step was performed using a three-variable Doehler design, involving three factors, stirring speed, fibre length and sample volume. The organic phase composition, as well as the pH of the acceptor and donor phases was also optimized. The extraction equilibrium was reached after 30 min, after which essentially the total amount (90 - 80 %) of the four dinitrophenolic compounds were extracted from the sample. Better repeatability and reproducibility at the expense of lower enrichment factors was obtained compared with other methods, employing incomplete extraction during a fixed time. The matrix effect was tested by performing extractions from leachate water and river water.

40|$|The {{lipophilicity}} of the nitrophenols, {{expressed as}} a waterâsolvent partition coefficient, P, has been investigated using the solvation equation, log P = c + eE + sS + aA + bB + vV. It is shown that this equation accounts quantitatively for lipophilicity in a selection of waterâsolvent systems, viz:[*] octanol, 1, 2 -dichloroethane, and cyclohexane. In the latter two systems, the {{major factor in the}} increased lipophilicity of 2 -nitrophenol over 3 - and 4 -nitrophenol is the lack of hydrogen bond acidity of 2 -nitrophenol. The waterâoctanol system differs in that the a coefficient is effectively zero, so that hydrogen bond acidity of solutes plays no part, and the three mononitrophenols then have similar lipophilicities. The <b>dinitrophenols</b> and picric acid are similarly discussed. The hydrogen bond acidity of 2, 3 -dinitrophenol (0. 67) is very much larger than that of 2, 4 - or 2, 5 -dinitrophenol (0. 09 and 0. 11), indicating a very much reduced internal hydrogen bonding. A similar but much smaller effect occurs with 2, 6 -dinitrophenol (A = 0. 17). Picric acid has a moderate hydrogen bond acidity (0. 46) so that the phenolic OH is still available for external hydrogen bonding. These results are confirmed by ab initio calculations which show that 2, 3 - and 2, 6 -dinitrophenol and picric acid are significantly distorted away from planarity, which apparently disrupts their internal hydrogen bonding...|$|R

The effects of 4 -nitrophenol, 3, 4 -dinitrophenol, 3 -nitrophenol, and 2, 5 -dinitrophenol, in increasing carbon dioxide output relative to oxygen consumption, are not explicable {{on the basis of}} simple hyperventilation, and are attributed to a metabolic effect at the cellular level. The potency of the nitrophenols in stimulating respiration is related to their structure, nitro groups being most effective in the ortho position and least effective in the meta position, and 2, 4 -dinitrophenol being the most powerful respiratory stimulant of the group. 2, 6 -Dinitrophenol does not conform to this generalization; one unique feature of its structure is indicated, as a possible explanation for the discrepancy. The gradation of potency of the nitrophenols (except 2, 6 -dinitrophenol) parallels the gradation of acidic properties in the group; the more strongly acid compounds stimulate respiration more powerfully. This is not a direct effect on blood pH, since the compounds were administered in neutral or slightly alkaline solution. Methaemoglobin formation was found to occur with 2, 5 -dinitrophenol, and to a smaller inconstant extent with three other compounds.
