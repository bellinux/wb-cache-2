NICAM standard (which stands for Near <b>Instantaneous</b> <b>Companded</b> Audio Multiplex) {{was designed to be}} a digital audio transmission standard and later it was used by the BBC to convey digital stereo sound for TV. It was obvious that allowing data transmission would be, if not a must, at least a welcome feature and in consequence it was extended to allow raw data or mixed data and sound to be transmitted. NICAM is feasible for terrestrial, cable, microwave links and satellites. This paper introduces some basic notions about NICAM datacasting and presents the results of a project whose aim was to design two PC-cards that allow unidirectional data transmission using the NICAM standard...|$|R

40|$|This chapter covers {{device and}} circuit aspects of {{low-power}} analog CMOS circuit design. The fundamental limits constraining {{the design of}} low-power circuits are first recalled {{with an emphasis on}} the implications of supply voltage reduction. Biasing MOS transistors at very low current provides new features but requires dedicated models valid in all regions of operation including weak, moderate and strong inversion. Low-current biasing also has a strong influence on noise and matching properties. All these issues are discussed, together with the particular aspects related to passive devices and parasitic effects. The design process has to be supported by efficient and accurate circuit simulation. To this end, the EKV compact MOST model for circuit simulation is shortly presented. The use of the basic concepts such as pinch-off voltage, inversion factor and specific current are highlighted thanks to some very simple but fundamental circuits and to an effective use of the model. New design techniques that are appropriate for low-power and/or low-voltage circuits are presented with an emphasis on the analog floating point technique, the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>companding</b> principle, and their application to filters...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} seventh-order 0. 05 ° equiripple linear-phase continuous-time filter employing, {{for the first}} time, <b>instantaneous</b> <b>companding.</b> The filter was {{designed}} and integrated in a mature bipolar process. The amount of boost (up to 13 dB) and group-delay adjustment (+/- 30 %) are digitally programmable. The DC gain is controllable up to 10 dB, and the - 3 dB frequency (fc) is tunable from 5 to 70 MHz. The output swing for 1 % THD is higher than 100 mVpp, with a 1. 5 V supply. The filter consumes very low power (5 [...] 13 mW for fc = 70 MHz), compared to state-of-the-art implementations (e. g. 120 mW for fc = 100 MHz [1]). An approach to estimate the distortion in log-domain filters is also presented. The models used for the bipolar transistors include the C pi and Csub parasitic capacitors, the beta effect, and the parasitic emitter resistances. Simple closed-form expressions describing the effect of each nonideality on distortion are derived and compared to simulations.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} enhancement of the dynamic range per unit power con-sumption of analog filters using dynamic biasing. A technique for realizing dynami-cally biased log-domain filters while maintaining input-output linearity is presented. This method is much simpler than previously known techniques for realizing large dynamic range filters using syllabic or <b>instantaneous</b> <b>companding.</b> The consequent advantages of the proposed technique are pointed out. In order to demonstrate {{the capabilities of the}} proposed dynamically-biased log-domain filters, a third-order Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of 1 MHz is de-signed in a 0. 25 µm BiCMOS technology. Circuit techniques to ensure proper operation of the filter over a wide range of input currents are presented. With suitable dynamic bias-ing, the fabricated filter can maintain a THD 53. 7 dB for differential input current amplitudes ranging from 3 µA to 2. 5 mA (a range of 58. 4 dB). In terms of the range of signals that can be handled, the performance is equivalent to that of a conven-tional filter with a maximum signal to noise ratio of 112 dB. The filter draws 575 µW from a 2. 5 V supply in the quiescent condition and 26. 1 mW with the maximum input amplitud...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a median-rate speech coder, the {{controlled}} adaptive prediction delta modulation coder (CAPDM), which operates at 16 kb/s with good speech quality and low algorithm complexity [15]. The coder is dedicated to personal communication network (PCN) applications and transmits speech samples {{on the basis of}} packets. It combines the features of one-step looking forward decision, syllabic companding, instan-taneous companding, and adaptive prediction. In addition to the use of a short-term prediction filter, CAPDM also exploits the pitch property to predict speech waveform explicitly. With the aid of a pitch prediction filter, the performance of a CAPDM codec improves about 3 dB in segmental signal-to-noise ratio (SEGSNR). The average SEGSNR of CAPDM. FF is about 21 dB, which is 7 dB over traditional CVSD at 16 kb/s. We also utilize an adaptive postfilter (APF) to enhance the perceptual quality of the decoded speech. The mean opinion score (MOS) listening test of CAPDM. FF with APF shows that its average score achieves 4. 19, which is as good as G. 728 16 -kb/s LD-CELP and is comparable with CCITT G. 721 32 -kb/s ADPCM. The complexity of CAPDM. FF is evaluated to be 8 MIPS, which is much lower than that of LD-CELP and could be further reduced by adopting a smaller correlation window for pitch detection. To solve the problem of packet loss, we developed a packet-based waveform substitution method by reinitializing the codec parame-ters {{at the beginning of each}} packet. The simulation results show that CAPDM. FF could tolerate 5 % of packet loss and still keep an SEGSNR at 10 dB and an MOS at about 3. 0.

40|$|At the moment, about 30 {{million people}} {{worldwide}} {{are suffering from}} hearing loss. Most people are helped with a simple hearing aid that just amplifies sounds coming to the ear. However, if the hearing loss is too severe, these aids will not help. More than 100. 000 people worldwide need a more complex device in order to let them hear again. A cochlear implant is such a device and is partially implanted inside the human body. Today’s implants {{are not able to}} let people hear sounds as people hear them with normal hearing. The main cause {{can be found in the}} stimulation accuracy of the auditory nerve fibres. To improve this accuracy, research should be performed in order to improve stimulation algorithms, increase the amount of electrodes and focus the stimulation field of the electrodes. Researchers now reached the limitations of existing neural response readout systems needed for reading out the evoked compound action potential for their research. These limitations urge the need for a new neural response readout system having a dynamic range of 126 dB, that is small, power efficient, has noise levels under 10 µV and can handle input signals exceeding the supply voltage. The readout system will be able to read out 256 electrodes and is implemented in a MEMS cochlear implant. Existing techniques do not offer solutions to meet the above specifications. An overall readout system design is proposed based on compensation containing an input system, multiplexer, compensation circuit, amplifier and an analog to digital converter (ADC). Because the overall readout system is too big to design in one thesis, only the input system is handled. Existing techniques do not offer solutions to handle input signals above supply voltage being compact, power efficient, have high dynamic range and have a low noise contribution. A new technique based on additive <b>instantaneous</b> <b>companding</b> in order to record the evoked compound action potentials from the stimulated auditory nerve is proposed. Three alternative circuit implementations are proposed, two voltage domain implementations and a charge domain implementation. The proposed input systems are designed to be implemented in AMIS I 3 T 25 (high voltage) CMOS technology. The charge domain circuit implementation is very promising only using 70 components, having a bandwidth of 10 kHz, and a noise level of 1. 1 pV. It is capable to readout input signals which are bigger than the supply voltage while the signal information is preserved. For checking the correct working of the circuit, a signal reconstruction is performed. In addition, this charge domain implementation is never reported before in literature.
