5|$|Living organisms must {{obey the}} laws of thermodynamics, which {{describe}} the transfer of heat and work. The second law of thermodynamics states that in any closed system, the amount of entropy (disorder) cannot decrease. Although living organisms' amazing complexity appears to contradict this law, life is possible as all organisms are open systems that exchange matter and energy with their surroundings. Thus living systems are not in equilibrium, but instead are <b>dissipative</b> systems that maintain their state of high complexity by causing a larger increase in the entropy of their environments. The metabolism of a cell achieves this by coupling the spontaneous processes of catabolism to the non-spontaneous processes of anabolism. In thermodynamic terms, metabolism maintains order by creating disorder.|$|E
25|$|The full {{generalization}} of Nyquist noise {{is found in}} fluctuation electrodynamics, which describes the noise current density inside continuous media with <b>dissipative</b> response in a continuous response function such as dielectric permittivity or magnetic permeability.|$|E
25|$|For {{a static}} <b>dissipative</b> mat to be {{reliably}} grounded {{it must be}} attached to a path to ground. Normally, both the mat and the wrist strap are connected to ground by using a common point ground system (CPGS).|$|E
25|$|In the {{vicinity}} of electrostatic sensitive devices, a ground (earth) mat or grounding (earthing) mat is used to ground static electricity generated by people and moving equipment. There are two types used in static control: Static <b>Dissipative</b> Mats, and Conductive Mats.|$|E
25|$|Many salient {{characteristics}} of the fundamental molecules of life (those found in all three domains) all point directly to the involvement of UV-C light in the <b>dissipative</b> structuring of incipient life. Some {{of the most difficult}} problems concerning the origin of life, such as enzyme-less replication of RNA and DNA, homochirality of the fundamental molecules, and the origin of information encoding in RNA and DNA, also find an explanation within the same <b>dissipative</b> thermodynamic framework by considering the probable existence of a relation between primordial replication and UV-C photon dissipation. Michaelian suggests that it is erroneous to expect to describe the emergence, proliferation, or even evolution, of life without overwhelming reference to entropy production through the dissipation of a generalized chemical potential, in particular, the prevailing solar photon flux.|$|E
25|$|The {{equivalent}} {{series resistance}} (ESR) summarizes all resistive losses of the capacitor. These are the supply line resistances, the contact resistance of the electrode contact, the line resistance of the electrodes and the dielectric losses in the dielectric film. The largest share of these losses is usually the <b>dissipative</b> losses in the dielectric.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea that}} there are 4 classes of {{dynamical}} system came originally from nobel-prize winning chemist Ilya Prigogine who identified these 4 classes of for thermodynamical systems - (1) systems in thermodynamic equilibrium, (2) spatially/temporally uniform systems, (3) chaotic systems, and (4) complex far-from-equilibrium systems with <b>dissipative</b> structures (see figure 1 in Nicolis' paper (Prigogine's student)).|$|E
25|$|The {{energy source}} under the thermosynthesis {{hypothesis}} was thermal cycling, {{the result of}} suspension of protocells in a convection current, as is plausible in a volcanic hot spring; the convection accounts for the self-organization and <b>dissipative</b> structure required in any origin of life model. The still ubiquitous role of thermal cycling in germination and cell division is considered a relic of primordial thermosynthesis.|$|E
25|$|Alginate is a {{polysaccharide}} that readily forms chains; {{it can be}} cross-linked at its carboxylic {{groups with}} multivalent cations such as Cu2+, Ca2+, or Al3+ to form a more mechanically stable hydrogel. Calcium alginates form polymers that are both biocompatible and non-immunogenic and {{have been used in}} tissue engineering applications. However, they are unable to support longitudinally oriented growth, which is necessary for reconnection of the proximal end with its target. In order to overcome this problem, anisotropic capillary hydrogels (ACH) have been developed. They are created by superimposing aqueous solutions of sodium alginate with aqueous solutions of multivalent cations in layers. After formation, the electrolyte ions diffuse into the polymer solution layers, and a <b>dissipative</b> convective process causes the ions to precipitate, creating capillaries. The <b>dissipative</b> convective process results the opposition of diffusion gradients and friction between the polyelectrolyte chains. The capillary walls are lined with the precipitated metal alginate, while the lumen is filled with the extruded water.|$|E
25|$|His modular {{dissection}} of a space-filling tetrahedron or MITE (minimum tetrahedron) into 2 A and 1 B module {{served as}} a basis for more speculations about energy, the former being more energy conservative, the latter more <b>dissipative</b> in his analysis.(986.422921.20, 921.30). His focus was reminiscent of later cellular automaton studies in that tessellating modules would affect their neighbors over successive time intervals.|$|E
25|$|Many Russian {{scientists}} and inventors were émigrés, like Igor Sikorsky, {{who built the}} first airliners and modern-type helicopters; Vladimir Zworykin, often called the father of TV; chemist Ilya Prigogine, noted {{for his work on}} <b>dissipative</b> structures and complex systems; Nobel Prize-winning economists Simon Kuznets and Wassily Leontief; physicist Georgiy Gamov (an author of the Big Bang theory) and social scientist Pitirim Sorokin. Many foreigners worked in Russia for a long time, like Leonard Euler and Alfred Nobel.|$|E
25|$|Convection in {{a liquid}} or gas {{is another example}} of {{emergent}} macroscopic behaviour that makes sense only when considering differentials of temperature. Convection cells, particularly Bénard cells, are an example of a self-organizing system (more specifically, a <b>dissipative</b> system) whose structure is determined both by the constraints of the system and by random perturbations: the possible realizations of the shape and size of the cells depends on the temperature gradient as well as the nature of the fluid and shape of the container, but which configurations are actually realized is due to random perturbations (thus these systems exhibit a form of symmetry breaking).|$|E
25|$|In recent times, reaction–diffusion {{systems have}} {{attracted}} much interest as a prototype model for pattern formation. The above-mentioned patterns (fronts, spirals, targets, hexagons, stripes and <b>dissipative</b> solitons) {{can be found}} in various types of reaction-diffusion systems in spite of large discrepancies e.g. in the local reaction terms. It has also been argued that reaction-diffusion processes are an essential basis for processes connected to morphogenesis in biology and may even be related to animal coats and skin pigmentation. Other applications of reaction-diffusion equations include ecological invasions, spread of epidemics, tumour growth and wound healing. Another reason for the interest in reaction-diffusion systems is that although they are nonlinear partial differential equations, there are often possibilities for an analytical treatment.|$|E
25|$|In {{the normal}} mode {{descriptions}} of Schumann resonances, the fundamental mode is a standing wave in the Earth–ionosphere cavity with a wavelength {{equal to the}} circumference of the Earth. This lowest-frequency (and highest-intensity) mode of the Schumann resonance occurs at a frequency of approximately 7.83Hz, but this frequency can vary slightly {{from a variety of}} factors, such as solar-induced perturbations to the ionosphere, which compresses the upper wall of the closed cavity. The higher resonance modes are spaced at approximately 6.5Hz intervals, a characteristic attributed to the atmosphere's spherical geometry. The peaks exhibit a spectral width of approximately 20% on account of the damping of the respective modes in the <b>dissipative</b> cavity. The 8th partial lies at approximately 60Hz.|$|E
25|$|In 1951 Herbert Callen and Theodore Welton {{proved the}} quantum fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) which was {{originally}} formulated in classical form by Nyquist (1928) {{as an explanation}} for observed Johnson noise in electric circuits. Fluctuation-dissipation theorem showed that when something dissipates energy, in an effectively irreversible way, a connected heat bath must also fluctuate. The fluctuations and the dissipation go hand in hand; {{it is impossible to}} have one without the other. The implication of FDT being that the vacuum could be treated as a heat bath coupled to a <b>dissipative</b> force and as such energy could, in part, be extracted from the vacuum for potentially useful work. FDT {{has been shown to be}} true experimentally under certain quantum, non-classical, conditions.|$|E
25|$|In the {{standard}} model of AGN, cold material close to a black hole forms an accretion disc. <b>Dissipative</b> processes in the accretion disc transport matter inwards and angular momentum outwards, while causing the accretion disc to heat up. The expected spectrum of an accretion disc peaks in the optical-ultraviolet waveband; in addition, a corona of hot material forms above the accretion disc and can inverse-Compton scatter photons up to X-ray energies. The radiation from the accretion disc excites cold atomic material close to the black hole and this in turn radiates at particular emission lines. A large fraction of the AGN's radiation may be obscured by interstellar gas and dust close to the accretion disc, but (in a steady-state situation) this will be re-radiated at some other waveband, most likely the infrared.|$|E

2500|$|A static <b>dissipative</b> mat that {{rests on}} a {{conductive}} surface (commonly the case in military facilities) are typically made of 3 layers (3-ply) with static <b>dissipative</b> vinyl layers surrounding a conductive substrate which is electrically attached to ground (earth). For commercial uses, static <b>dissipative</b> rubber mats are traditionally used that are made of 2 layers (2-ply) with a tough solder resistant top static <b>dissipative</b> layer that makes them last longer than the vinyl mats, and a conductive rubber bottom.

[...] LES resolves scales from the domain size [...] down to the filter size , and as such a substantial portion of high wave number turbulent fluctuations must be resolved.

[...] Chapter 13 of Pope addresses the question of how fine a grid resolution [...] is needed to resolve a filtered velocity field [...] [...] Ghosal found that for low-order discretization schemes, such as those used in finite volume methods, the truncation error can be the same order as the subfilter scale contributions, unless the filter width [...] is considerably larger than the grid spacing [...] [...] While even-order schemes have truncation error, they are non-dissipative, and because subfilter scale models are <b>dissipative,</b> even-order schemes will not affect the subfilter scale model contributions as strongly as <b>dissipative</b> schemes.|$|E
2500|$|If the {{bifurcation}} is subcritical, often localized structures (<b>dissipative</b> solitons) can {{be observed}} in the hysteretic region where the pattern coexists with the ground state.

Each function, for which a reaction diffusion differential equation holds, represents in fact a concentration variable.|$|E
2500|$|A {{good example}} of {{nonlinear}} electromagnetics is in high energy dense plasmas, where vortical phenomena occur which seemingly violate the second law of thermodynamics by increasing the energy gradient within the electromagnetic field and violate Maxwell's laws by creating ion currents which capture and concentrate their own and surrounding magnetic fields. In particular Lorentz force law, which elaborates Maxwell's equations is violated by these force free vortices. These apparent violations are {{due to the fact}} that the traditional conservation laws in classical and quantum electrodynamics (QED) only display linear U(1) symmetry (in particular, by the extended Noether theorem, conservation laws such as the laws of thermodynamics need not always apply to <b>dissipative</b> systems, which are expressed in gauges of higher symmetry). The second law of thermodynamics states that in a closed linear system entropy flow can only be positive (or exactly zero at the end of a cycle). However, negative entropy (i.e. increased order, structure or self-organisation) can spontaneously appear in an open nonlinear thermodynamic system that is far from equilibrium, so long as this emergent order accelerates the overall flow of entropy in the total system. The 1977 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to thermodynamicist Ilya Prigogine for his theory of <b>dissipative</b> systems that described this notion. Prigogine described the principle as [...] "order through fluctuations" [...] or [...] "order out of chaos". It has been argued by some that all emergent order in the universe from galaxies, solar systems, planets, weather, complex chemistry, evolutionary biology to even consciousness, technology and civilizations are themselves examples of thermodynamic <b>dissipative</b> systems; nature having naturally selected these structures to accelerate entropy flow within the universe to an ever-increasing degree. For example, it has been estimated that human body is 10,000 times more effective at dissipating energy per unit of mass than the sun.|$|E
2500|$|All {{real-world}} oscillator {{systems are}} thermodynamically irreversible. [...] This means there are <b>dissipative</b> {{processes such as}} friction or electrical resistance which continually convert some of the energy stored in the oscillator into heat in the environment. [...] This is called damping. [...] Thus, oscillations tend to decay with time unless there is some net source of energy into the system. The simplest description of this decay process can be illustrated by oscillation decay of the harmonic oscillator.|$|E

The timescale of tens of seconds of long GRBs hereby appears to be intrinsic to their inner engine, for example, associated with a viscous or a <b>dissipative</b> process.|$|E

[...] As a <b>dissipative</b> element, even an ideal resistor naturally produces a randomly fluctuating voltage, or noise, across its terminals. [...] This Johnson–Nyquist noise is a fundamental noise source which depends only upon the temperature and resistance of the resistor, and is predicted by the fluctuation–dissipation theorem. Using a larger value of resistance produces a larger voltage noise, whereas a smaller value of resistance generates more current noise, at a given temperature.|$|E
