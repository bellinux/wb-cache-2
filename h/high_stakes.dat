If a {{champion}} was pinned by another competitor, then they lost their championship in the encounter. Mondo ended up pinning Flash to win the Iron Man Championship in the bout. On July 13, 2002 at CZW's Deja Vu, Flash and Pain fought to a double pinfall for the CZW Iron Man and World Heavyweight Championships, which Pain held. Due to the double pinfall, Flash won the Iron Man Championship, while Pain retained the World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|Despite these challenges, {{the huge}} {{quantities}} of gold coming through Dawson City encouraged a lavish lifestyle amongst the richer prospectors. Saloons were typically open 24 hours a day, with whiskey the standard drink. Gambling was popular, {{with the major}} saloons each running their own rooms; a culture of <b>high</b> <b>stakes</b> evolved, with rich prospectors routinely betting $1,000 ($27,000) at dice or playing for a $5,000 ($140,000) poker pot. The establishments around Front Street had grand facades in a Parisian style, mirrors and plate-glass windows and, from late 1898, were lit by electric light. The dance halls in Dawson were particularly prestigious and major status symbols, both for customers and their owners. Wealthy prospectors were expected to drink champagne at $60 ($1,600) a bottle, and the Pavilion dancehall cost its owner, Charlie Kimball, as much as $100,000 ($80 million) to construct and decorate. Elaborate opera houses were built, bringing singers and specialty acts to Dawson.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a series of {{competitive}} labour market experiments in which subjects have the possibility to reciprocate favours. In the <b>high</b> <b>stake</b> condition subjects earned between two and three times their monthly income during the experiment. In the normal stake condition the stake level was reduced by a factor of ten. We observe that both in the high and the normal stake condition fairness concerns are strong enough to outweigh competitive forces and give rise to non-competitive wages. There is also no evidence that effort behaviour becomes generally more selfish at <b>higher</b> <b>stake</b> levels. Therefore, our results suggest that, contrary to common beliefs, fairness concerns may play an important role even at relatively <b>high</b> <b>stake</b> levels.

25|$|Although {{aggressive}} encounters are {{ubiquitous in}} the animal kingdom, with often <b>high</b> <b>stakes,</b> most encounters that involve aggression may be resolved through posturing, or displaying and trial of strength. Game theory is used to understand how such behaviors might spread by natural selection within a population, and potentially become 'Evolutionary Stable Strategies'. An initial model of resolution of conflicts is the hawk-dove game. Others include the Sequential assessment model and the Energetic war of attrition. These try to understand not just one-off encounters but protracted stand-offs, and mainly differ in the criteria by which an individual decides to give up rather than risk loss and harm in physical conflict (such as through estimates of resource holding potential).|$|E

Following a timeout called by the Fighting Irish, he toed the line in a 66-66 game and sank two free throws to give Kentucky a 68 to 66 lead. The margin remained intact as Notre Dame's Jerian Grant missed a contested 3-pointer as time expired.
