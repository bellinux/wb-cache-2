5|$|The Republican offer {{called for}} an {{approximately}} $35 billion budget and no tax increases, and relied on delaying the payment of some K-12 school aid and issuing bonds against future tobacco revenue to cover the remaining gap. It differed from the previous Republican proposals in several provisions, particularly increasing the K-12 per-student formula by $50 per year to cover additional borrowing costs, adding $10 million to the University of Minnesota budget to equalize Minnesota State Colleges and Universities cuts, and restoring funding to the Department of Human Rights and the Trade Office. Dayton's conditions were that measures on social issues such as abortion be dropped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget,</b> 15percent reductions to state employees in all agencies be dropped, and a $500 million infrastructure construction bonding bill.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Radford was a {{principal}} opponent {{to a plan}} to merge the uniformed services. A plan existed to split the Army and the Army Air Forces into separate branches and unite them and the Navy under one Cabinet-level defense organization. Fearing {{the loss of their}} branch's influence, Navy commanders opposed the formation of a separate Air Force and favored a more loose defense organization. Radford was picked by Forrestal to form the Secretary's Committee of Research and Reorganization. Months of discussion resulted in the National Security Act of 1947, a political victory for the Navy because it created the U.S. Air Force while resulting in a coordinated, not unified, U.S. Department of Defense with limited power and with the Navy maintaining control of its air assets. In 1947, Radford was briefly appointed commander of the Second Task Fleet, a move he felt was to distance him <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> negotiations in Washington, but nonetheless preferred.|$|E
5|$|At the queen's villa in Algiers, Ranavalona was {{provided}} with servants and a French female attendant who kept her under observation and remained present whenever the queen entertained guests in her home. In addition, {{the government of}} France initially provided Ranavalona with an annual allowance of 25,000 francs paid <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> for the colony of Madagascar and authorized by the colony's Governor General. Nearly all the queen's property had been seized by the colonial authority, although she had been permitted to keep certain personal belongings, including some of her jewelry. Her initial pension allowed such a humble lifestyle that the colonial government of Algeria lobbied unsuccessfully several times on her behalf to obtain an increase for her. Ranavalona also tasked a servant with selling some of her jewelry for cash, but the plan was discovered by the French colonial authorities and the servant was discharged and sent back to Madagascar.|$|E

Senator Brian Taniguchi argued the legislature could work on several issues simultaneously and the bill would pass. If passed, the amended bill would have to be approved by the House of Representatives. Speaker of the House Calvin Say stated that a vote on the bill would depend on whether the Senate passed the bill with enough votes to override a gubernatorial veto, arguing that {{he does not want to}} force a vote on controversial legislation in an election year if the bill's approval was in doubt. The Senate bill contains an effective date of January 1, 2010, and if the language is not changed, the bill could be vetoed regardless of its content.|$|E

The MSU Budget Council held campus hearings on the issue, and provided three scenarios: A 3 to 5 percent increase in tuition (equal to $150 to $250 per year for in-state students), tapping reserve funds, or a combination of both. The reserve funds included the university's general reserve fund (which held $5.4 million), and as many as 30 other contingency funds, multi-year spending funds, or funds which ended the previous budget year with leftover money.|$|E
25|$|Al-Bashir has {{achieved}} {{economic growth in}} Sudan. This was pushed further by the drilling and extraction of oil. However, economic growth has not been shared by all. Headline inflation in 2012 approached the threshold of chronic inflation (period average 36%), about 11 percentage points up <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> projection of 2012 reflecting the combined effects of inflationary financing, the depreciation of the exchange rate, and the continued removal of subsidies, as well as high food and energy prices. This economic downturn prompted cost of living riots that erupted into Arab Spring-style anti-government demonstrations; also it aroused the discontent of the Sudanese Worker's Trade Union Federation (SWTUF), which threatened to hold nationwide strikes in support of higher wages. The continued deterioration {{in the value of}} the Sudanese pound (SDG) poses grave downside risks to already soaring inflation. This, coupled with the economic slowdown, presents serious challenges to the implementation of the approved Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP).|$|E
