30|$|The third {{approach}} is financial control theory. Because {{of the important}} role of currency in capitalist production and reproduction, financial control theory emphasizes the core position of financial institutions in interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks.</b> Studies of American enterprises’ interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> in the 1960 s discovered that those occupying the core positions of most interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> were banks and insurance companies (Mizruchi 2007; Mintz and Schwartz 1981). Studies of Canadian enterprises’ interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> in the 1960 s also show that financial institutions would be based on the situations of running their invested enterprises to selectively appoint directors to supervise them and urging nonfinancial enterprises to make conservative investments (Richardson 1987).|$|R
30|$|The third issue {{concerns}} the social function of interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks.</b> Kono et al. (1998) argue that localized interlocking directorate relations {{are more likely}} to be an elite formation mechanism. Our study shows that regionally localized interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> are widespread in China. As a result, one question worthy of additional study is to determine whether localized interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> promote the cohesion of business elites or whether elite cohesion (e.g., co-membership in business clubs) promotes the formation of localized interlocking networks.|$|R
30|$|Enterprises {{with the}} same {{property}} rights {{are more likely to}} constitute interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks.</b>|$|R
30|$|The fourth {{approach}} is collusion theory. This theory {{argues that the}} emergence of interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> {{is due to the}} collusion among enterprises (Mizruchi 1996). To reduce competition, especially between businesses of counterparts in the same industry, enterprises appoint directors for each other. Through interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> enterprises that were initially competing with each other could now have coordinated actions and thus acquire high profits.|$|R
30|$|State-owned or {{controlled}} {{corporations are}} more likely to form interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> than non-state-owned or controlled corporations.|$|R
30|$|The above {{theories}} have explained the basic formation mechanisms of interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> among enterprises within a market economy, {{which can be}} called the “market theory” {{for the construction of}} interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks.</b> However, previous studies have more or less neglected the political and economic backgrounds within which interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> are constructed. A consensus among economic sociologists is this: sociological studies of company governance should pay attention to institutional origins, action processes, and influences on social agents, and how they evolve over time (Davis 2005; Yang 2012). With regard to the institutional environment of Chinese enterprises, what is different in China’s market economy is how state forces can have direct control over or indirect influence on Chinese enterprises (Zhang 2010; Keister 1998; Walder 2011). Through what mechanism can state-owned enterprises (hereafter SOEs) construct their interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks?</b> Moreover, is there any discrepancy between these networks and the economic logic of market theory? Apart from economic reasons, do state-controlled enterprises abide by political orders, policy necessities, and social demands? Without empirical evidence, there are no answers to the above questions as of now. Starting with market theory, this article aims to expound on the institutional foundation of interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> of Chinese enterprises, especially SOEs, {{from the perspective of the}} unique governance structure of SOEs 1 and the special supervision mode of state-owned assets.|$|R
30|$|Last is geospace {{mechanism}} or propinquity theory. When placed near each other, enterprises {{are more}} likely to have frequent interactions. One important premise for building interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> is that enterprises must be aware of each other’s existence. The analysis of Kono et al. (1998) about Fortune 500 companies shows that the distance between the headquarters of enterprises can influence the construction of interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> between them.|$|R
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{structural}} aspects of interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> within and among fifteen European countries. The results show large quantitative differences in network densities within countries. These differences are strongly and {{significantly related to the}} 'variety of capitalism' in place. Second, an analysis of the interlocking directorates across country borders reveals a European interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>network</b> in which different countries take quite different positions. As it turns out, a country's international position is strongly and significantly related to its EU membership duration. Additionally, there are indications of a link between the structure of the interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>network</b> within a country and how that country is positioned in the international network. Data were collected in 2006 concerning 362 corporations with 6115 board positions in fifteen European countries...|$|R
30|$|Establishing SASACs at {{different}} administrative levels has strengthened the top-down influence of state ownership {{on the construction}} of interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks.</b> According to the regulations for administering and supervising state assets, the SASAC holds the ultimate power in appointing and dismissing leaders of state-owned corporations. The one important responsibility of each administrative-level SASAC is to appoint, dismiss, assess, and award or punish the principals of state-invested corporations based on their performance. 5 Especially, within the administration model of the optimum seeking method, the higher the executive power of a SASAC, the more difficult its administrative efforts. This is because this kind of SASAC often manages state-owned corporations that are vital to Chinese people’s livelihood and the national economy. Accordingly, one could infer that the influence of state ownership {{on the construction of}} interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> can be differentiated based on the executive levels of SASACs. The stricter the corporations’ personnel appointments (e.g., subject to external directors and the leadership rotation system), {{the more likely it is}} that state-owned corporations will construct interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks.</b> Based on this assumption, I put forward two more hypotheses about the formation of Chinese interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks.</b>|$|R
30|$|As for {{the control}} {{variable}} of region, compared to the reference group of Northwest, those companies located in east China {{are more likely to}} build interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks.</b> The coefficient of this variable shows statistical significance through all four models. East China has a long tradition of business culture; especially after the great reform and opening in 1980 s, the Yangtze River Delta Economic Zone {{has become one of the}} fastest-developing economic regions in China. The analytical results show that interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> are more likely to appear in a fairly developed business environment, in which case, the geospatial mechanism can partially explain the construction of interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks.</b> Based on the companies’ dyadic level, the following section further examines whether the geospatial mechanism is valid. In other words, we examine whether companies within the same region are more likely to build interlocking networks than those in different regions.|$|R
30|$|This article {{uses the}} {{interlocking}} <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> of Chinese listed companies as an exemplar {{to investigate the}} dual logic, i.e., economic and institutional, behind the construction of China’s interfirm networks. This can {{make up for the}} shortcomings of past studies that had a heavy focus on economic efficiency but not enough attention on institutional background. Generally speaking, the construction of interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>network</b> requires directors, supervisors, or senior managers to serve on no less than two companies. This kind of network is sometimes also ingeniously portrayed as “straddled directors/supervisors” (Li 2007, 2009).|$|R
30|$|The {{higher the}} {{administrative}} level of an SASAC to which state-owned or state-controlled corporations are affiliated, {{the more likely}} it is that these corporations will form interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks.</b>|$|R
30|$|Based on model 2, model 4 further differentiates the {{administrative}} levels to which SOEs are affiliated. This model shows that compared to non-state-controlled enterprises, {{the chance for}} central government-controlled enterprises to build interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> is 2.74 times higher, the chance for provincial government-controlled enterprises is 1.83 times higher, and the chance for city government-controlled enterprises is 1.31 times higher. It is evident {{that the relationship between}} {{the administrative}} levels to which state-controlled companies are affiliated and their likelihood of building interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> is positive. All these results show high statistical significance regarding QAP. However, we also found that there is no statistical significance between county-controlled companies and nongovernment-controlled companies, which could infer that the enthusiasm of lower-level governments to participate in the administration of state-owned companies has decreased. In short, the findings of model 4 support hypothesis 4, i.e., the higher the administrative level to which government-controlled companies are affiliated, {{the more likely it is}} that these companies will build interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks.</b>|$|R
30|$|Table  3 {{shows that}} {{companies}} that have {{the same type of}} largest shareholders (state owned or not) are more likely to construct interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks.</b> Notably, though, this relationship does not occur randomly, which shows statistical significance in the sense of QAP. Especially, after the establishment of SASAC in 2003, the odds for listed companies of the same ownership to construct interlocking relations improved significantly, and the boundaries between different types of ownership become clearer. For instance, in 2003, the odds between companies whose largest shareholders are of the same ownership constructing interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> are 21 % higher than companies with different types of ownership. This relationship shows statistical significance in regard to QAP. In 2008, this number reached 43 %, which also shows statistical significance regarding QAP (see Table  3). In short, these results support hypothesis 2, i.e., from the perspective of convergence of organizational behavior companies with the same ownership are more likely to constitute interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks.</b>|$|R
30|$|Second, we further refined the {{ownership}} network variable. The variable “different administrative {{levels of government}} control networks” was substituted for “the largest shareholder network” in the benchmark test while other network variables were kept unchanged. We continued the QAP analysis (see Table  5). In the same way, this test produced results consistent with the benchmark test. For the variable of different administrative level controlled networks, among all seven observational years, interlocking directorate relations {{are more likely to}} appear between companies with the same type of governmental controller. This result shows statistical significance in regard to QAP. For instance, in 2005, when measured by different administrative level of government control, the odds of companies with the same ownership to construct interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> is 52 % higher than cross-ownership interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> (see Table  5). Although cross-administrative interlocking directorate relations are existent, e.g., interlocking between companies controlled by the state council SASAC and companies controlled by provincial SASAC, the analytic results in this study show that interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> are more common between companies controlled by the same administrative level of government. Regardless of the approach by which ownership is measured, the likelihood for companies subject to the same ownership to construct interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> is higher than that for those companies subject to cross-ownership or cross-administrative level of governmental control.|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Table  2, {{the reason that}} {{commerce}} enterprises have a greater propensity for building interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> {{is because they are}} more sensitive to changes in the supply and demand of the market compared to manufacturing enterprises (the reference group). They thus have a greater need to have a stable system to reduce market uncertainties. This is also a core mechanism of resource dependence theory. For example, wholesale and retail businesses are particularly sensitive to any information about supply and demand in the market; they can use interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> to obtain such information so as to reduce market uncertainties.|$|R

30|$|As for debt-to-asset ratio, {{supervision}} and control theory predicts that interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> {{are more likely to}} be established between companies that have a significant gap in terms of debt-to-asset ratio. In Table  3, we find that there are only 2  years out of the 11  years from 2000 – 2010 in which the construction of interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> is more likely to occur between companies that have a significant debt-to-asset ratio gap. In contrast, in 2007 companies with a similar debt/asset ratio were more likely to build interlocking relations. No other results have any statistical significance in regard to QAP. In brief, the predictions of supervisory control theory are not supported by this study.|$|R

30|$|Within the politicized {{governance}} structure, {{there are}} two measures of personnel appointment that have increased the possibility of constructing interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> among SOEs. One is the outside director system, {{and the other is}} the leadership rotation system. Non-SOEs do not have these restrictions.|$|R
30|$|In various {{fields of}} social sciences, {{studying}} interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> {{can contribute to}} the understanding of company governance, company performance, class cohesion, unified action of business elites, and so on (Ma 2014). China’s management studies have provided a foundation for studying Chinese interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> (Ren et al. 2001; Ren et al. 2004, 2007; Lu and Cheng 2009; Han et al. 2015). Because data of listed companies are rich, authoritarian, and attainable, American economic and organizational sociologists have always stressed the importance of collecting and using these materials. Chinese economic and organizational sociologists should also fully exploit this resource, expanding the span of relevant studies focusing on socioeconomic changes during China’s economic transition. This article {{can be viewed as a}} preliminary attempt at achieving this goal.|$|R
30|$|Apart from that, {{looking at}} the {{differences}} between {{inside and outside the}} political system, constructing cross-administrative interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> should be much easier than constructing cross-ownership interlocking networks because the former belongs to connections within the system whereas the latter belongs to cross-system connections. Due to this consideration, we can further categorize four types of interlocking networks: within-system interlocking whose controllers are at the same administrative level, within-system and cross-administrative-level interlocking, cross-system and cross-ownership interlocking relations, and interlocking relations outside of the system. The distribution and evolution of these four types of interlocking relations are worthy of in-depth investigation. Overall, Table  5 supports hypothesis 2; i.e., two companies in the same category of ownership are more likely to constitute interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks.</b>|$|R
30|$|Based on this theory, one {{important}} goal for constructing interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> {{is to reduce}} enterprises’ dependence on external resources, thus reducing the uncertainties that {{may be caused by}} resources’ volatility. Board directors not only supervise managers within an enterprise {{but at the same time}} also play the role of a resource provider (e.g., consultant) and/or a matchmaking informer for the enterprise’s development. The social capital (i.e., relationships) of any interlocking directorate is precisely manifested through its ability to provide useful information for the enterprises; it is an effective means for enterprises to acquire the key development resources (Hillman and Dalziel 2003). Empirical research has shown that building an interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>network</b> with investment banks can reduce enterprises’ dependence on investment banks (Baker 1990).|$|R
30|$|Model 3 {{examines}} the changing effects state ownership has on interfirm networks {{before and after}} the establishment of SASACs. We used 2004 as the demarcation point for year variables to code in a dichotomous dummy variable. This operation after 2004 is denoted as 1, and before 2004 as 0, and this variable is interacted with the largest shareholder variable. We can see that companies whose largest shareholder is the state are 3.05 times more likely to construct interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> after 2004 than before 2004. This result also shows high statistical significance regarding QAP statistics, which supports hypothesis 3. State-owned companies are more likely to construct interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>networks</b> than non-state-owned companies. This effect was enhanced after the establishment of SASAC at all administrative levels.|$|R
30|$|The {{results of}} model 1 {{show that the}} odds of {{companies}} with the state as their largest shareholder establishing an interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>network</b> is 30 % {{higher than those of}} other companies.

30|$|The {{limitations}} {{of our research}} offer more opportunities for future examination. First, although we are fully confident that our findings can be generalized to the listed firm in the whole interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>network</b> in China, we are not reasonably sure whether the conclusion can be generalized to isolated actors (listed firms) and non-listed firms. The former category, i.e., isolated firms, have no ties with other firm and belong to an entirely different mechanism {{because they have no}} imprint in the interlocking <b>directorate</b> <b>network.</b> As for the latter category, i.e., non-listed firms, they have a completely different operating and management environment. Although our empirical analysis does not systematically contain all the types of firms for the data limitation, it undermines no referential significance of conclusions. Future researchers may examine different samples and measurements to construct the listed-firm network.|$|R
