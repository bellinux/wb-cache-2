An Act of June 1938 “increased {{the functions of the}} National Society for Cheap Houses and Dwellings and empowered it, under State guarantee, to contract a loan of 350 million francs,” while a Royal Decree of July 1938 laid down the rules of applying the provisions of a Holidays with Pay Act passed in 1936 to agricultural, horticultural and forestry undertakings. An Act of the 20th of August 1938 amended and supplemented a Holidays with Pay Act previously passed in 1936 by extending its coverage to all undertakings, whatever their number of wage earners, as well as to home workers. The Act also removed a previous requirement in which a wage earner had to work {{for at least a year}} with the same employer in order to earn an annual holiday. An Act of the 8th of July 1938 amended the miners' old-age, invalidity and survivors' insurance scheme by increasing the benefits payable to invalids, aged persons and widows already in receipt of a pension, while also significantly widening the conditions for the grant of <b>invalidity</b> <b>pensions.</b> An Order of the 25th of August 1938 prohibited the use of so-called motor spirit “for greasing, cleaning (hands) etc.,” while a Royal Order of the 27th of August 1938 fixed normal weekly hours of actual work in the ship-repairing industry in Antwerp at 42 hours “distributed over the seven days of the week.” A Royal Order of the 27th of December 1938 extended the scope of an eight-hour Act passed in June 1921 to cover technical staff employed in cinemas, and a Royal Order of the 22nd of December 1938 amended the entries in the second column of the schedule (list of occupations) which was now brought into conformity with Convention No.42, and added “in the case of pneumoconiosis, sand-blasting processes in iron and steel foundries.|$|E

40|$|This study {{occupies}} {{itself with}} legal aspects of invalidity from youth. It represents {{an issue that}} is very significant from the social point of view although not regulated as single problem by law. However the whole theme infiltrates to another specific fields: social insurance, assessment medicine, psychology, juristic section, medicinal issue, ethics, upbringing and special pedagogy in a broad meaning. Current Czech law regulation of theme concerning benefits for persons with long-term unfavorable health state is based on concept of full and partial invalidity pension as benefits within pension insurance scheme and pension increase for incapacity (helplessness). Generally full and partial invalidity pension benefits originate from reduction of gainful activity and reaching of relevant time period of pension insurance. According to a survey it is evident that number of awarded full and partial <b>invalidity</b> <b>pensions</b> has increased in Jihočeský" region. Respecting diagnostic flags structure the greatest occurrence of full <b>invalidity</b> <b>pensions</b> from youth has been recorded in group of intermediate cephalonia. Solving of social insurance of the elderly is planned under the pension reform at the present. The main goal of invalidity pension is permission to live {{as close as possible to}} normal state thus to face up to a handicap and to secure appropriate family, social and work life. In fine we could deduce that there should be confirmation of obligatory conversion of full invalidity pension to old-age pension when reaching retirement age within Czech pension reform. In my study I have focused on some factors decisive for occurrence of full or partial invalidity. It represents socially significant problems in broad range of relations that establish or could establish. Long-term loss or reduction of ability to work have negative impact not only on individuals but also affect social status of their families and thus negatively influence the whole society. Exclusion from work process traumatizes young people. Pension benefits provided to the disabled from youth are not deduced from tolled premiums. That is the reason I think this should be solved out of the pension insurance system as well as pension increase for incapacity (helplessness). Costs on these benefits would be compensated by state budget within pension insurance system in the near future with perspective of transmission of these benefits to other social scheme. In this connection it is necessary to emphasize that mankind should be made sure that there is basic perception and crucial aim of social welfare in focusing on level and quality of life of individuals and their families not affected by unfavorable social or economic influences as well as their health state and well-being that will not be compounded by diseases and injuries. This fact will substantially affect the strategy of modern social policy...|$|E
40|$|The {{disabling}} {{nature and}} lifelong impact of multiple sclerosis (MS) imposes considerable socioeconomic burden despite its relative low prevalence {{compared to other}} chronic diseases. This is the first study of MS in the Slovak Republic that provides information about healthcare and social expenditures including costs of productivity loss caused by reduced work capacity of patients with MS. Retrospectively direct and indirect costs of MS were investigated by prevalence based “bottom-up” approach. The societal and health insurance perspective was used to perform the overall economic burden caused by MS in Slovakia. The human capital method {{was used for the}} calculation of indirect costs, as this is the most common method applied in published studies. As not all detailed data on expenditures were available, the missing data were collected in the retrospective patient research. Total annual costs in 2010 for 6. 100 dispensed patients with MS in Slovakia were € 54. 723. 592. Indirect costs (€ 31. 728. 757) prevailed over direct costs (€ 22. 994. 834).

40|$|After {{stabilising}} in {{the years}} after 1995, the Austrian social expenditure ratio went up again, albeit slightly, in 1999. As reported by the European System of Integrated Social Protection Statistics (ESSPROS) used by the EU, Austria spent ATS 781 billion (€ 56. 8 million) on social security in 1999, which translated into a growth of 4. 9 percent over the previous year, whereas nominal GDP rose by just 3. 5 percent. In terms of GDP, the social expenditure ratio, at 28. 9 percent, thus was 0. 4 percentage points higher than in 1998. Almost half of the social expenditure (47. 6 percent) was spent on old age and survivors' pensions; 26. 2 percent went to health spending, whereas expenditure on families, at 10. 4 percent, was the third-largest segment in social expenditure. Another 8. 8 percent was paid out as <b>invalidity</b> <b>pensions</b> to people below the age of 60. The remaining 5. 5 percent were expenditures on active and passive labour market policies, rounded off by 1. 6 percent in other expenditures. In comparison with the previous year an above-average growth was found for expenditure on families (7. 7 percent), health (6. 4 percent) and invalidity (6. 1 percent). The increase was even more substantial for the "other expenditures" item (20. 3 percent). These include social assistance paid by the states, benefits in kind rendered at local government level, housing assistance and other benefits to prevent marginalisation. The growth shown by old-age and survivors pensions and unemployment was less pronounced than the overall rise in expenditure on social security. In a European comparison, the Austrian social expenditure ratio of 1998 (social expenditure for 1999 reported in line with the ESSPROS system is not yet available for the EU), is 0. 8 percentage points above the EU- 15 average of 27. 7 percent. In Sweden, France, Denmark and Germany, the ratio was higher than in Austria. Broken down by function groups, deviations from the EU average were found for old age and survivors' pensions and in children and family benefits. In each of these sectors, Austria spends 1. 4 percentage points more, whereas its expenditure on unemployment, housing and efforts to prevent social marginalisation is lower than the EU- 15 average.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the European System of Integrated Social Protection Statistics (ESSPROS), {{developed}} by the Statistical Office of the European Community, social expenditure for all EU-countries have been newly recorded on a standardized base, thereby enabling meaningful comparative analysis. According to this new system, Austrian social expenditure in 1995 totaled ATS 694 billion, equivalent to 29. 5 percent of GDP. Since 1980, current social protection expenditure rose by 157 percent and as a ratio of GDP by 2 ½ percentage points. During the 1980 's, changes in the social outlays/GDP ratio were dominated by cyclical variations: it rose over the period of sluggish growth until 1987, but fell back with the subsequent recovery – eventually even below the 1980 level. In the early 1990 's however, it ratcheted upwards, due to a number of discretionary raises in benefits such as an extension of paid maternity leave higher pension entitlements for women, family tax credits and nursing care benefits. In 1995, the rise in the social expenditure/GDP ratio leveled off, despite a cyclical weakening accompanied by a rise in unemployment. Also in 1996, the ratio may have remained flat in view of measures to cut the government deficit. Since 1980, the expenditure components showing the strongest increase are unemployment benefits (+ 660 percent rise) and <b>invalidity</b> <b>pensions</b> (+ 225 percent). Old-age pension outlays (+ 175 percent) also expanded above-average because of discretionary benefit increases and the system maturing (with new retires having acquired progressively longer entitlement periods). The relative importance of social expenditure in Austria is similar to that in other European countries with comparable economic and social structure. As a proportion of GDP, it is slightly above the EU-average for 1994, which is dampened by the absence of Sweden (prior to accession) and the very low level of social spending in the southern European countries. For the EU as a whole, the ratio has moved up by 4 ¼ percentage points since 1980; apart from a catching-up effect in southern Europe, strong advances in the U. K. (+ 6 percentage points), Denmark and France (+ 5 points each) have contributed to this development. The structural composition of social outlays in Austria differs markedly from the EU-average insofar, as old-age pensions (Austria 49 percent, EU 44 percent) and family subsidies (11 versus 8 percent) claim a much larger share, whereas the share of spending on unemployment benefits (6 against 9 percent) as well as on sickness and invalidity payments (33 versus 35 percent) is distinctly lower in Austria than on the average of EU countries.

40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} the coordinated {{rehabilitation}}. Coordinated rehabilitation is a coherent process of medical, educational, vocational and social rehabilitation, whose main objective is to minimalize the consequences, based on the individual's disability. Successful rehabilitation consists in ensuring early, continuous and coordinated efforts of the fastest and widest participation of persons with disabilities in the usual activities of life. The theoretical part consists of six basic chapters. The first one {{is devoted to the}} International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, which is followed by the subchapter dealing with disabilities and consequently mental disabilities. I have focused on people with mental disabilities, as an organization where research was conducted, providing services to these people. The second chapter contains information about coordinated rehabilitation. The remaining chapters deal with the individual components of a coordinated rehabilitation, which are medical, educational, vocational and social rehabilitation. The aims of this thesis is to determine how the system of coordinated rehabilitation is used in the Institute of social care Domečky. A partial aim is to determine the importance of a system of coordinated rehabilitation for clients of the Institute of social care Domečky. There are two research questions in the connection with the thesis aims. The main research question is: How are the individual components of a coordinated rehabilitation applied in the Institute of social care Domečky? The particular research question finds positives provides system of coordinated rehabilitation for clients of the Institute of social care Domečky. Qualitative research was chosen for the practical section of the thesis. I have used the questioning method and the technique of the semi-controlled dialoque, Results were evaluated using the method of make the clusters. The selected group consisted of 11 employees of the Institute of social care Domečky. The respondents have been chosen intentionally, according to the criterion of willingness to participate in research. The results are divided into two sections according to the research questions. The first section {{deals with the}} way the use of individual components of the coordinated rehabilitation in the Institute of social care Domečky. These results are also divided by the individual components of coordinated rehabilitation for greater clarity. The first part contains the identification of the respondents. Following parts: medical rehabilitation, educational rehabilitation, vocational rehabilitation and social rehabilitation. The second part of results includes the subjective opinions of the respondents on the benefits of coordinated rehabilitation and its benefit to the clients of the organization. The research has shown ignorance of the concept of coordinated rehabilitation. Within medical rehabilitation it was found that health care is provided by nurses and practical doctor. The organization also works with hospitals and polyclinics, which are next to the organization. The research, which is devoted to educational rehabilitation, results divided terminology used in special education. Vocational rehabilitation can be used by clients within a job in the kitchen and the laundry in the organization or employment in the civic association Pferda which offer a job in a cafe, a cleaning company and a bakery.

40|$|Objectives:To {{investigate}} the socioeconomic aspects {{and the outcome}} of femorodistal bypass grafting operations in terms of general health state. Design:Prospective open clinical study. Material: 168 operations in 153 patients. Methods:A structured questionnaire {{was used to assess}} quality of life, and each patient was classified into a health state group defined by levels of disability and distress. Results:Before operation 23 patients were actively employed, 96 were old age pensioners, 29 received <b>invalidity</b> <b>pension,</b> and five were long term sick, 80 % were living in their own home without any help. Only 19 patients were actively employed at follow up, 12 of these had been working before the operation, and seven other patients had taken up paid work. About three-quarters of the patients could manage daily life without help after the operation, and 82 % had no or only mild distress. There were significant changes with respect to physical mobility in all groups and emotional status in one group. In all other cases a significant change could not be shown. The median Quality of Life score at follow up was 0. 986 (n = 102, variance 0. 022). The immediate costs were £ 1. 5 million. Conclusions:The classification into disability and distress groups was informative, but the methods for assessment of the results of vascular surgery on quality of life, evaluation of patients satisfaction and of patients' expectations must be further developed...|$|R
40|$|Legal {{regulation}} of pension insurance in the Czech Republic and the Polish The {{goal of this}} diploma theses is {{to point out the}} legal {{regulation of}} pension insurance in the Czech republic and the Republic of Poland putting emphasis on regulation of different types of pension. The thesis consists of four chapters. The first chapter analyzes the historical evolution of pensions and the pension insurance. It comprises three periods. The first period ends {{at the time of the}} World War I., the second one lasts until the end of the forties of the 20 th century and the last one ends in the late 20 th century. This chapter outlines the history evolution separately for both of the states. The second chapter is a base of this paper. It examines contemporary legal regulation of pension insurance in the Czech republic. At the beginning of the chapter, there are explained fundamental principles of the Czech pension insurance system and also essential terms. The following part of the second chapter explores legal regulation of allowances including old-age <b>pension,</b> <b>invalidity</b> <b>pension,</b> widow's and widower's pension and orphan's annuity. In the connection with every single mentioned matter, it puts emphasis on the following: the conditions under which a claim to a pension can be acquired, modified or extincted and the [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|A plan {{to boost}} {{economic}} growth to 4% a year was never met, while development aid was cut severely {{as a result}} of austerity measures. A proposed [...] "minimum income guarantee" [...] for widows and pensioners was never implemented, together with Richard Crossman's compulsory national superannuation scheme. This scheme, a system of universal secondary pensions, was aimed at providing British pensioners with an income closer to what they enjoyed during the best years of their working life, when their earnings were at their highest. According to Brian Lapping, this would have been Wilson's largest reform of social security, had it been carried out. A proposed means-tested Family Supplement debated in cabinet and supported by the (then) Chancellor James Callaghan. never came into being, although it was later introduced by the Heath Government under the name “Family Income Supplement.” In June 1969, the government announced plans for introducing two new benefits for the disabled an “attendance allowance” for the very severely disabled, and an “invalidity pension” for people forced to retire early due to illness. Neither benefit, however, came into being during the remainder of the First Wilson Government’s time in office, although the proposed attendance allowance would later be introduced by the Heath Government and the <b>invalidity</b> <b>pension</b> by the Second Wilson Government. In addition, the government's austerity measures led to an unpopular squeeze on consumption in 1968 and 1969.|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} whether the Antonov-sky Sense of Coherence test administered before and after electroconvulsive treatment (ECT) can contribute more information pertinent to outcome than a test of depression. Method: Twenty patients with a severe unipolar or bipolar depression underwent a series of unipolar ECT under standard con-ditions. As part of the routine of the department, the patients filled in, before and after ECT, the following questionnaires: Beck Depression Inventory (Beck), 20 -item version and Antonovsky Sense of Coherence test (SOC), 13 -item version. Mean age was 40. 3, somewhat less for women. Results: A reduction was obtained from 35 to 17 in total score on Beck, i. e., to mild depression. The SOC value increased to the normal range from a mean of 2. 5 to 3. 2, indicating a better manageability, comprehensibility and mean-ingfulness in life. Four patients had an <b>invalidity</b> <b>pension.</b> Ten of the 16 remaining patients attained work after ECT, and scored better than those not starting to work on both tests, SOC> Beck. A low SOC value may indicate increased mortality risk. Conclusions: Patients who are favorably treated with ECT against any depression, but who do not show a considerable improvement in SOC, would need special follow-up on factors not directly related to mental illness to reduce relapse and mortality risk.
