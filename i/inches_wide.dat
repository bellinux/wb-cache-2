5|$|At {{the end of}} December 1883, a {{humpback}} whale appeared in the Firth of Tay off Dundee, attracting much local interest. It was harpooned, but after an all-night struggle escaped. A week later it was found dead, and was towed on to the beach at Stonehaven, near Aberdeen. Struthers quickly visited the carcass, measuring it as 40 feet long with a tail 11 feet 4 <b>inches</b> <b>wide.</b> Struthers {{was not able to}} start dissecting it at once, as a local entrepreneur, John Woods, bought the whale and took it to his yard in Dundee, where on the first Sunday, 12,000 people paid to see it.|$|E

Additionally, the brick faced structure has an exterior patio constructed of slate. There are {{a total of}} six galleries at the museum, with four used for permanent collections and two galleries used for traveling exhibits. In 2008, colored reflector panels were added to the narrow second floor windows in order to provide more color to the exterior. Measuring 69.5 inches high by 21.75 <b>inches</b> <b>wide,</b> some of the panels are illuminated from the interior.|$|E
5|$|The {{western end}} of the chamber is closed off with a slab {{measuring}} about 4.42 metres (14 feet, 6 <b>inches)</b> <b>wide,</b> with a thickness of 30 centimetres (1 foot) and a depth of around 2.44 metres (8 feet). A collapsed, broken slab lies at the chamber's opening, eastern end. It {{is also possible that}} a largely rectangular slab {{at the bottom of the}} slope had once been part of the chamber's eastern end. Excavation has revealed that flint masonry was used to pack around the chamber and support its sarsens; 20th-century renovation has seen this largely replaced with cement, allowing the stones to continue standing upright.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in March 2013, the {{majority}} of the airline's fleet will be retrofitted with new Business and Economy Class seats. The seats are nearly identical to the new Regional Business Class and new Long-haul Economy Class products offered by parent company Cathay Pacific.

In-seat power outlets will be available to all passengers.

5|$|This {{species is}} oviparous, meaning these turtles produce {{offspring}} by laying eggs only {{and do not}} provide parental care outside of nest-building. Thus, the location and quality of nesting sites determine the offspring survival and fitness, so females invest significant time and energy into nest site selection and construction. Females select nest sites based on soil temperature (preferring warmer temperature nest sites), but not soil composition. Average nest size is four <b>inches</b> <b>wide</b> and three inches deep. Also, females build nests in elevated areas {{in order to avoid}} flooding and predation. After laying eggs, female wood turtles will cover the nest with leaves or dirt in order to hide the unhatched eggs from predators, and then the female leaves the nest location until the next mating season. Nesting sites can be used by the same female for multiple years. Because nest building occurs along rivers, females tend to spend more time along river areas, compared to male turtles.|$|E
