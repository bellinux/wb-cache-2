It's just a pippy-poo {{little book}} and people {{come back with}} this {{diatribe}} about its great social significance. Well it's just because nobody ever got off his high horse long enough to write to single women in any form they could associate with. If they had, somebody else would be the arbiter for single women at this point instead of me.|$|E

But writing this made me feel the {{responsibility}} of showing {{the truth of the}} pain that outcasts go through. It's not all razzle-dazzle show business. It's tough, and it's painful, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> growing up, and it is for most people." [...] Murphy commented that the episode caused him to realize that, as well as highlighting the [...] "fun and glamour" [...] of glee clubs, it is also occasionally [...] "really great [...] to show the underbelly of what people who are different feel." ...|$|E

In an interview with Los Angeles Magazine, Dickinson recalled the process of pitching her book to Regan: [...] "I got a book deal without even turning in one shred of a writing sample. I was having an invincible moment. I told her how difficult <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> growing up with an abusive father, how when I went to New York to become a model I was rejected for a year for being 'too ethnic.'

There was this moment where I felt like he had sort of {{looked at her and}} reckoned that he had won in life. Like, 'I'm a champion. We won. Our love made us a winner.' They were married 60 years. I thought about that idea, that the glorious moment of your life is when you decide that it's okay to go, you don’t have any more words to say, more business, more mountains to climb. You're on the cliff, you tip your hat to yourself and you go. That’s what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> in that moment when I witnessed it." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} in the online {{speculative}} fiction magazine Strange Horizons, Tony Keen was critical of Bear's novel, saying that {{the present and future}} passages [...] "do not mesh terribly well", and that it is [...] "too long" [...] with [...] "too many ideas". He complained that the book was difficult to follow and that Bear keeps [...] "moving the goalposts as it suits his narrative". Keen said that for a science fiction novel, he was surprised at its [...] "lack of consistency", and called it more a work of fantasy than science fiction. He said the [...] "revelations" [...] at the end still did not help explain what had happened, but that [...] "by this point, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> hard to care". A {{review in the}} Oakland Tribune complained that Bear, who it felt is not strong on [...] "crafting memorable characters", [...] "struggles" [...] with the novel's multiple viewpoints. The review added that while he [...] "takes {{a long time to get}} there, and arrives with a palpable scent of anticlimax, [...] does deliver at the end", although with not enough to satisfy the reviewer.|$|E
500|$|According to AllMusic, {{the album}} is mostly {{influenced}} by dance-pop, post-disco and pop rock music. The overall sound of Madonna is dissonant, {{and is in the}} form of upbeat synthetic disco, utilizing some of the new technology of the time, like the usage of Linn drum machine, Moog bass and the [...] This equipment has dated since, consequently the sound of the album comes off as somewhat harsh. Madonna commented on her debut album: [...] "The songs were pretty weak and I went to England during the recordings so I wasn't around... I wasn't in control. [...] I didn't realize how crucial <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to break out of the disco mold before I'd already finished the [...] album. I wish I could have got a little more variety there." [...] The album starts with the song [...] "Lucky Star", a medium-paced dance track, beginning with a sparkle of synth note and is followed by heavy beats of electronic drum and handclaps. A guitar is played in high riff and a bubbling bass synth is produced to accompany the guitar sound. The song revolves around the [...] "Starlight, starbright" [...] hook for more than a minute, before going to the chorus. According to author Rikky Rooksby, the lyrics are repetitive and inane, revolving around the transparent ambiguity of the stars, and juxtaposition of the male character with being a heavenly body in the sky.|$|E

I was trying on my own to quit and couldn't do it. I wanted to die. No one knew what I was going through. I could not quit. Church was my last shot.

[...] In a 2013 interview with Rolling Stone, Head described his final moments in the band as very tense; [...] "the last year I was in the band, we were gonna kick out the bass player, Fieldy, and this guy's girlfriend couldn't be {{on this side of the}} stage because there were fights with another wife in the band. And obviously the drugs – it's no secret I was into the drugs, so crazy stuff, like having to finish our blow right before we got to the border because they were gonna come check to see if we had anything." [...] Following his departure from Korn, Welch released two autobiographies, a solo album, and formed a band, Love and Death, who released a debut album in 2013.|$|E

And at the beginning I was very tense because I didn't know what their intentions were. I closed my eyes and said 'Look, you speak always about the power of music and how music can get people close to each other', and I was like aiming to their heart, and I'm singing especially for them, and then when I opened my eyes and I saw those people dancing with the Palestinian flag and singing with me together, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> like an amazing sight, because this is something that I don't think ever happened before.

2500|$|Before {{reaching}} Cao Cao's position, Yu Jin encountered {{about a dozen}} {{injured and}} naked men on the road. When he asked them what happened, they told him that they were robbed by the Qingzhou Corps (青州兵). The Qingzhou Corps was a unit in Cao Cao's forces formed by the former Yellow Turban rebels who surrendered to Cao in Qing Province (Qingzhou) in the early 190s. The furious Yu Jin said, [...] "The Qingzhou Corps are part of Lord Cao's army. How dare they become robbers!" [...] He then led his men to attack and punish them. Some of the Qingzhou soldiers escaped to Wuyin and accused Yu Jin of committing the crimes they were responsible for. When Yu Jin reached Wuyin, he immediately set up defensive fortifications around the camp instead of reporting directly to Cao Cao. His subordinates told him, [...] "The Qingzhou soldiers framed you. You should explain matters to Lord Cao as soon as possible." [...] Yu Jin replied, [...] "The enemy is still in pursuit and may reach here anytime. If we don't set up defences now, how can we expect to hold them off? Lord Cao is intelligent and wise. Those accusations aren't a cause for concern." [...] After the defences were set up, Yu Jin went to meet Cao Cao and explained everything. Cao Cao was pleased and he said, [...] "How dangerous <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> when we were defeated at the Yu River (淯水). General, you're able to bring order to chaos and hold your ground against a fierce enemy, and you display unwavering loyalty. Even the famous generals of ancient times couldn't have done better than you!"
