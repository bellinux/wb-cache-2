Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources, especially for applications such as home heating, opening a potential for widespread exploitation.

Total time for urban and extra urban cycle was 1180 sec. Engine was run in LPG mode by using conversion system. <b>Emissions</b> <b>were</b> tested as per standard procedure and <b>were</b> compared. Corrected <b>emissions</b> <b>were</b> computed by deducting ambient reading from sample reading. Paper describes detail emission test procedure and results obtained. CO <b>emissions</b> <b>were</b> {{in the range}} of 38. 9 to 111. 3 ppm. HC <b>emissions</b> <b>were</b> {{in the range of}} 18. 2 to 62. 6 ppm.

40|$|Gaseous {{emissions}} from a J 85 -GE- 13 turbojet engine were measured over {{a range of}} fuel-air ratios from idle to full afterburning and simulated altitudes from near sea-level to 12, 800 meters (42, 000 ft). Without afterburning, carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon <b>emissions</b> <b>were</b> highest at idle and lowest at takeoff; oxides of nitrogen exhibited the reverse trend. With afterburning, carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon <b>emissions</b> <b>were</b> greater than for military power. Carbon monoxide <b>emissions</b> <b>were</b> altitude dependent.

5|$|While {{operating}} in all-electric mode the Volt produces no tailpipe emissions. In this mode {{there is an}} absence of harmful chemical emissions that can negatively impact air quality, allowing for a continuous clean air benefit. There is also a lack of carbon dioxide emissions. However, this benefit is mostly local because, depending on {{the source of the}} electricity used to recharge the batteries, these <b>emissions</b> <b>are</b> shifted to the location of the electricity generation plants. The amount of carbon dioxide emitted depends on the emission intensity of the power source used to charge the vehicle. When the Volt's battery is depleted and the gasoline-powered engine engages, the plug-in <b>emissions</b> <b>are</b> similar to other internal combustion engine vehicles. The amount of total local emissions depends on how much the Volt is driven in all-electric mode and how much in charge-sustaining mode.|$|E
5|$|An {{emissions}} trading scheme for {{greenhouse gas emissions}} (GHGs) works by establishing property rights for the atmosphere. The atmosphere is a global public good, and GHG <b>emissions</b> <b>are</b> an international externality (p.21). The emissions from all sources of GHGs contribute to the overall stock of GHGs in the atmosphere. In the cap-and-trade variant of {{emissions trading}}, a limit on access to a resource (the cap) is defined and then allocated among users {{in the form of}} permits. Compliance is established by comparing actual emissions with permits surrendered including any permits traded within the cap. The environmental integrity of emissions trading is depends on the setting of the cap, not the decision to allow trading.|$|E
5|$|Beta decay (and {{electron}} capture): {{these processes}} are {{regulated by the}} weak force, and result from a transformation of a neutron into a proton, or a proton into a neutron. The neutron to proton transition is accompanied by the emission of an electron and an antineutrino, while proton to neutron transition (except in electron capture) causes the emission of a positron and a neutrino. The electron or positron <b>emissions</b> <b>are</b> called beta particles. Beta decay either increases or decreases the atomic number of the nucleus by one. Electron capture is more common than positron emission, because it requires less energy. In this type of decay, an electron is absorbed by the nucleus, rather than a positron emitted from the nucleus. A neutrino is still emitted in this process, and a proton changes to a neutron.|$|E

5|$|Electric cars, {{as well as}} plug-in hybrids {{operating}} in all-electric mode, emit no harmful tailpipe pollutants from the onboard source of power, such as particulates (soot), volatile organic compounds, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, ozone, lead, and various oxides of nitrogen. The clean air benefit is usually local because, depending on {{the source of the}} electricity used to recharge the batteries, air pollutant <b>emissions</b> <b>are</b> shifted to the location of the generation plants. In a similar manner, plug-in electric vehicles {{operating in}} all-electric mode do not emit greenhouse gases from the onboard source of power, but {{from the point of view}} of a well-to-wheel assessment, the extent of the benefit also depends on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation. This fact has been referred to as the long tailpipe of plug-in electric vehicles. From the perspective of a full life cycle analysis, the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, or nuclear power for PEVs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions. On the other hand, when PEVs are recharged from coal-fired plants, they usually produce slightly more greenhouse gas emissions than internal combustion engine vehicles and higher than hybrid electric vehicles. In the case of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles operating in hybrid mode with assistance of the internal combustion engine, tailpipe and greenhouse <b>emissions</b> <b>are</b> lower in comparison to conventional cars because of their higher fuel economy.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{radio and}} {{particle}} <b>emissions</b> <b>are</b> strongly modulated by its rotation, {{which makes the}} planet somewhat similar to a pulsar. This periodical modulation is probably related to asymmetries in the Jovian magnetosphere, which are caused by the tilt of the magnetic moment {{with respect to the}} rotational axis as well as by high-latitude magnetic anomalies. The physics governing Jupiter's radio emissions {{is similar to that of}} radio pulsars. They differ only in the scale, and Jupiter can be considered a very small radio pulsar too. In addition, Jupiter's radio emissions strongly depend on solar wind pressure and, hence, on solar activity.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecology of}} global carbon budgets gives {{one example of}} the linkage between {{biodiversity}} and biogeochemistry. It is estimated that the Earth's oceans hold 40,000 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon, that vegetation and soil hold 2070 Gt, and that fossil fuel <b>emissions</b> <b>are</b> 6.3 Gt carbon per year. There have been major restructurings in these global carbon budgets during the Earth's history, regulated to a large extent by the ecology of the land. For example, through the early-mid Eocene volcanic outgassing, the oxidation of methane stored in wetlands, and seafloor gases increased atmospheric CO2 (carbon dioxide) concentrations to levels as high as 3500ppm.|$|E

40|$|This master {{thesis is}} dealing with {{monitoring}} of gaseous products of microbial decomposition of organic pollution in constructed wetland. This wetland was used for wastewater treatment in a village Slavošovice, Czech Republic. Emissions of CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O were measured in one treatment bed of the system. The <b>emissions</b> <b>were</b> quantified, their seasonal course was followed, and the main factors affecting gaseous <b>emissions</b> <b>were</b> identified. Only 3 % of total C <b>emissions</b> <b>were</b> in form of methane, N 2 O <b>emissions</b> <b>were</b> negligible and only 1, 5 % of nitrogen denitrified were in form of N 2 O.

5|$|The {{majority}} of these <b>emissions</b> <b>are</b> thought to be produced by a mechanism called Cyclotron Maser Instability, which develops close to the auroral regions, when electrons bounce {{back and forth between}} the poles. The electrons involved in the generation of radio waves are probably those carrying currents from the poles of the planet to the magnetodisk. The intensity of Jovian radio emissions usually varies smoothly with time; however, Jupiter periodically emits short and powerful bursts (S bursts), which can outshine all other components. The total emitted power of the DAM component is about 100GW, while the power of all other HOM/KOM components is about 10GW. In comparison, the total power of Earth's radio emissions is about 0.1GW.|$|E
5|$|Bright arcs and spots {{sporadically}} appear {{within the}} main ovals. These transient phenomena {{are thought to}} be related to interaction with the solar wind. The magnetic field lines in this region are believed to be open or to map onto the magnetotail. The secondary ovals observed inside the main oval {{may be related to the}} boundary between open and closed magnetic field lines or to the polar cusps. The polar auroral <b>emissions</b> <b>are</b> similar to those observed around Earth's poles: both appear when electrons are accelerated towards the planet by potential drops, during reconnection of solar magnetic field with that of the planet. The regions within both main ovals emit most of auroral X-rays. The spectrum of the auroral X-ray radiation consists of spectral lines of highly ionized oxygen and sulfur, which probably appear when energetic (hundreds of kiloelectronvolts) S and O ions precipitate into the polar atmosphere of Jupiter. The source of this precipitation remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|LCA is {{used for}} example in the {{building}} sector. Buildings today account for the 40% of the world’s energy use. The resulting carbon <b>emissions</b> <b>are</b> substantially {{higher than those of}} the transportation sector. New buildings using more energy than necessary are being built every day, and millions of today's inefficient buildings will remain standing until at least 2050. It’s therefore necessary to start reducing energy use in new and existing buildings {{in order to reduce the}} planet's energy-related carbon footprint. Growing interest, space, and attention in the architecture sector are directed to environmental issues according to the principles of green building. Mineral, vegetable, or animal materials such as perlite, vermiculite, rock wool, glass wool, cork, plant fibers (cotton, flax, hemp, coconut), wood fiber, cellulose, and sheep's wool can be used for the production of insulation panels.|$|E

40|$|On Jan. 24, 1986, {{during the}} inbound {{trajectory}} to Uranus, the planetary radio astronomy instrument on Voyager 2 detected left-hand-polarized emission {{for several hours}} at frequencies near 200 kHz. Unlike the dominant source observed on the nightside of the planet, only a single episode of this inbound <b>emission</b> <b>was</b> seen, and the <b>emission</b> <b>was</b> extremely weak. Generating less than 500 kW, it is probably the weakest freely propagating planetary radio emission thus far observed by Voyager.
