5|$|At {{the end of}} the Cold War, the Army saw further <b>drawdowns</b> and {{reductions}} in spending. The 29th Infantry Division was retained, however 2nd Brigade was inactivated in favor of assets from the inactivating 26th Infantry Division, which was redesignated the 26th Brigade, 29th Infantry Division.|$|E
5|$|With the US Army {{forces in}} Europe seeing <b>drawdowns</b> and redeployments, it was {{announced}} that V Corps would be eliminated, and the 130th Engineer Brigade would be moved elsewhere. The brigade formally left Hanau with a Casing of the Colors ceremony at Pioneer Kaserne on 4 May 2007. Casing the unit's colors was a tradition formally signifying its inactivation and, for all official purposes, the brigade had ceased to be an active Army unit. The brigade headquarters became part of U.S. Army Pacific on 16 June 2007.|$|E

This would be a {{continuation}} of the current policy of gradual <b>drawdown.</b> Obama has stated that he prefers a gradual <b>drawdown.</b>|$|R
30|$|Numerical {{analysis}} of a perforated well has also been conducted. The key focus of the analysis is to evaluate and examine the critical <b>drawdown</b> pressure for different reservoir pressures. The {{results showed that the}} equivalent plastic shear strain increased with reservoir depletion and an increase in <b>drawdown</b> pressure. Further evaluations were conducted on safe <b>drawdown</b> changes with depletions. The critical <b>drawdown</b> window plot was generated and can be used to estimate the allowable <b>drawdown</b> pressure for different reservoir depletions. In addition, it was shown that the produced sand volume and sand mass rate increase with an increase in <b>drawdown</b> pressure.|$|R
25|$|In this {{equation}} {{the left side}} is {{the present value of}} the draw downs made by the lender and the right side is the present value of the repayments made by the borrower. In both cases the present value is defined given the APR as the interest rate. So the present value of the <b>drawdowns</b> is equal to the present value of the repayments, given the APR as the interest rate.|$|E
25|$|As the war {{lengthened}} and the withdrawals continued, the {{two sides}} {{became more and more}} antagonistic toward one another and they battled constantly over the issues of combat refusals and the drug and morale problems of American troops. Fatigue with the war and each other have been cited for this escalating antagonism. Although MACV officially remained dedicated to providing evenly balanced public affairs information, the situation was exacerbated by the manpower <b>drawdowns</b> at the Public Affairs Office itself.|$|E
25|$|Wetlands {{are another}} major {{attractant}} of wildlife {{in the airport}} environment. They are of particular concern because they attract waterfowl which have a high potential to damage aircraft (Federal Aviation Administration 2013). With large areas of impervious surfaces, airports must employ methods to collect runoff and reduce its flow velocity. These best management practices often involve temporarily ponding runoff. Short of redesigning existing runoff control systems to include non-accessible water such as subsurface flow wetlands (DeVault et al. 2013), frequent <b>drawdowns</b> and covering of exposed water with floating covers and wire grids should be employed (International Civil Aviation Organization 1991). The implementation of covers and wire grids must not hinder emergency services.|$|E

25|$|Despite Secretary Forrestal's prediction, the Corps {{faced an}} {{immediate}} institutional crisis following the war. Army brass {{pushing for a}} strengthened and reorganized defense establishment also attempted to fold the Marine mission and assets into the Navy and Army. Drawing on hastily assembled Congressional support, the Marine Corps rebuffed such efforts to legislatively dismantle the Corps, resulting in statutory protection of the Marine Corps in the National Security Act of 1947. Despite the introspective crisis, Marines also suffered from major post-war cutbacks and <b>drawdowns</b> in size. For example, aviation fell from 116,628 personnel and 103 squadrons on 31 August 1945 to 14,163 personnel and 21 squadrons on 30 June 1948, with another 30 squadrons in the reserves.|$|E
500|$|During the 2000 presidential election, the {{readiness}} of the 10th Mountain Division became a political issue when George W. Bush asserted that the division was [...] "not ready for duty." [...] He attributed the division's low readiness to the frequent deployments throughout the 1990s without time in between for division elements to retrain and refit. A report from the US General Accounting Office in July 2000 also noted that although the entire 10th Mountain Division was not deployed to the contingencies at once, [...] "deployment of key components—especially headquarters—makes these divisions unavailable for deployment elsewhere {{in case of a}} major war". Conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation agreed with these sentiments, charging that the US military overall was not prepared for war due to post-Cold War <b>drawdowns</b> of the US Military. The Army responded that, though the 10th Mountain Division had been unprepared following its deployment as Task Force Eagle, that the unit was fully prepared for combat by late 2000 despite being undermanned. Still, the Army moved the 10th Mountain Division down on the deployment list, allowing it time to retrain and refit.|$|E
500|$|Daley {{came into}} office {{in a city with}} revenue-generating assets, {{manageable}} debt and flush pension funds, but he left behind a city with a structural deficit that Mayor-elect Rahm Emanuel estimated at $1.2 billion when under-funded pension funds were included. The Daley administration's expenditures exceeded revenues by {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} a year. In August 2010, Fitch Ratings downgraded the city's bond credit rating, citing the administration's use of reserve funds for general operating expenses and under-funding of its pension funds, and noted that the city faced rising fixed operating costs yet lacked plans for new revenue. Wall Street analysts noted that the Daley administration began drawing on the city's reserves as early as 2006, before the 2008–2012 global recession. [...] "While there had been sound economic growth in years prior to 2008, there were still sizable fund balance <b>drawdowns</b> in both 2006 and 2007," [...] Fitch wrote. The city's budgets continued to increase even after the recession began, to more than $6 billion a year, and, when under-funded city employee pension funds were included, the city's annual deficit exceeded $1 billion. In January 2011, Moody's Investors Service downgraded to a [...] "negative" [...] outlook some of the revenue bonds issued for the $15 billion O'Hare Modernization Program and related infrastructure projects, citing the city's plan to postpone repayment of interest and principal on some construction bonds.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the classic Kelly gambling problem with general distribution of outcomes, {{and an additional}} risk constraint that limits {{the probability of a}} <b>drawdown</b> of wealth to a given undesirable level. We develop a bound on the <b>drawdown</b> probability; using this bound instead of the original risk constraint yields a convex optimization problem that guarantees the <b>drawdown</b> risk constraint holds. Numerical experiments show that our bound on <b>drawdown</b> probability is reasonably close to the actual <b>drawdown</b> risk, as computed by Monte Carlo simulation. Our method is parametrized by a single parameter that has a natural interpretation as a risk-aversion parameter, allowing us to systematically trade off asymptotic growth rate and <b>drawdown</b> risk. Simulations show that this method yields bets that out perform fractional-Kelly bets for the same <b>drawdown</b> risk level or growth rate. Finally, we show that a natural quadratic approximation of our convex problem is closely connected to the classical mean-variance Markowitz portfolio selection problem...|$|R

In September, the Army also moved an additional Caribou company into the country, but these transports remained outside {{the control of the}} group. [...] The group had conducted inspections of its C-123s in May that disclosed that all 37 aircraft that had been in country since 1962 showed visible damage, and 11 required major repair. [...] By October, however, sufficient additional C-123s had been withdrawn from Air Force Reserve units in the United States to form a fourth Provider squadron, the 19th Air Commando Squadron. [...] In December, half of the 310th Troop Carrier Squadron moved to Nha Trang Air Base to replace C-47s that had been operating from that base. [...] The remainder of the squadron would follow in June 1965.|$|E
2500|$|Investors in {{hedge funds}} are, in most countries, {{required}} to be qualified investors who {{are assumed to be}} aware of the investment risks, and accept these risks because of the potential returns relative to those risks. Fund managers may employ extensive risk management strategies in order to protect the fund and investors. According to the Financial Times, [...] "big hedge funds have some of the most sophisticated and exacting risk management practices anywhere in asset management." [...] Hedge fund managers that hold a large number of investment positions for short durations are likely to have a particularly comprehensive risk management system in place, and it has become usual for funds to have independent risk officers who assess and manage risks but are not otherwise involved in trading. A variety of different measurement techniques and models are used to estimate risk according to the fund's leverage, liquidity and investment strategy. Non-normality of returns, volatility clustering and trends are not always accounted for by conventional risk measurement methodologies and so in addition to value at risk and similar measurements, funds may use integrated measures such as <b>drawdowns</b> [...]|$|E

Due to the properties of the maximum <b>drawdown,</b> this equation has a nonstandard boundary condition. We apply an alternating direction implicit method to solve the equation numerically.
