50|$|A {{supplementary}} spring steel safety clip is clipped over the <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> and bushing {{on top of}} the grenade preventing the <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> from moving.|$|R
50|$|Early models (*950* and *950B* Pre-1968) do {{not have}} a <b>safety</b> <b>lever,</b> {{employing}} a half-cock notch on the hammer instead. Later models (*950BS* Post-1968) are provided with an external <b>safety</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|R
50|$|The weapon has a grip safety {{as well as}} a <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> on {{the left}} side of the receiver, over the pistol grip. The {{standard}} version also has a combination lock above the trigger near the <b>safety</b> <b>lever.</b> In the selective-fire variants, this <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> doubles as a fire selector. The magazine release is found behind the magazine well, and the charging knob is {{on the left side of}} the upper receiver.|$|R
50|$|The V40 grenade is spherical in shape, 6.5 cm high, and 4 cm in {{diameter}} - approximately {{the size of}} a golf-ball. It has a safety pin and <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> with a <b>safety</b> clip attached to the <b>safety</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Model 953 {{fires in}} full auto only {{and it also}} has a unique feature, a <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> in front of the forward {{magazine}} housing. To fire the Model 953 you must grip the magazine housing and hold down the <b>safety</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The M61 is the M26A1 with {{an extra}} safety (called the [...] "jungle clip") {{attached}} to the <b>safety</b> <b>lever.</b> This is to prevent the <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> from flying off and allowing the striker to function if the safety pin gets accidentally pulled out by snagging it on jungle vegetation.|$|R
5000|$|Next, the grenade's {{pull ring}} is grasped with the non-throwing hand while {{maintaining}} a firm grasp {{on the body of}} the grenade and <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> (also referred to as the [...] "spoon") with the throwing hand. The pull ring and safety pin assembly are fitted so that a right-handed thrower can grasp the grenade with the fuse assembly on top and the <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> held down by the right thumb. A left-handed thrower should grasp the grenade with the fuse assembly on the bottom and the <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> held down by the left thumb.|$|R

50|$|Once {{the soldier}} throws the grenade, the <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> releases, the striker throws the <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> {{away from the}} grenade body as it rotates to {{detonate}} the primer. The primer explodes and ignites the fuse (sometimes called the delay element). The fuse burns down to the detonator, which explodes the main charge.|$|R

50|$|The folding {{stock is}} made of tubular steel covered with leather and folds onto {{the right side of}} the firearm. The M/50 fires in full-auto only {{features}} a <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> unusually placed in front of the forward magazine housing. To fire the M/50 the operator must grip the magazine housing and hold down the <b>safety</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Lack of {{external}} <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> for increased speed and simplicity also offers less chance of snagging on clothes ...|$|R
50|$|The M9 {{features}} multiple internal safeties, {{including a}} firing pin block that prevents {{the firing pin}} from moving without the trigger being pulled, and a firing pin striker that rotates when the <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> is engaged preventing the firing pin from being hit even if the hammer falls. The M9 also has an ambidextrous external <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> allowing both left and right handed people to engage or disengage the safety mechanism.|$|R
50|$|The M1905/M1906 Vest Pocket pistol {{incorporated}} a grip safety mechanism that constituted the entire rear {{section of the}} grip. This particular safety mechanism required {{a significant amount of}} hand palm pressure to disengage and allow the trigger to release the striker to fire the pistol. Colt produced a nearly identical pocket pistol, the Colt Model 1908 Vest Pocket, which {{incorporated a}} small <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> {{on the left side of}} the receiver which locked the trigger. In addition, this <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> mechanism locked the slide about a half inch back from the front of the pistol to enable easy disassembly. FN also added this <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> mechanism to its pistol, but did not add the magazine safety mechanism that Colt introduced in 1916.|$|R
50|$|Certain handguns {{manufactured}} with no external <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> (on-off/armed-safe), such as double-action revolvers and Glock pistols, {{can have}} one added by aftermarket companies.|$|R

2500|$|Llama M-87: Manufactured from 1986 to 1997. Self-loading pistol, {{original}} design with Beretta falling-block type locked breech, in 9mm parabellum with double-stack 15-round magazine. Numerous modern {{features such as}} ambidextrous de-cocker <b>safety</b> <b>lever,</b> magazine <b>safety,</b> reversible magazine release. High-grade competition pistol based on M-82 with extended barrel, compensator, muzzle weight, target sights, target trigger, additional manual safety, extended magazine release, extended <b>safety</b> <b>levers,</b> and two-tone finish (chrome with blued slide). Despite the high price, the M-87 was greeted with excellent reviews on release ...|$|R
5000|$|Type F is a double/single-action (DA/SA) pistol with {{a manual}} safety that {{also serves as}} a hammer {{decocking}} lever. It operates {{in the same way as}} the Beretta 92F (M9) service pistol. Pushing the slide mounted <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> down returns the hammer to its [...] "down" [...] position and also disconnects the trigger so that the pistol cannot be fired until the <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> is pushed up into the [...] "fire" [...] position. There is also a half-cock safety notch.|$|R
50|$|Safety/arming {{mechanisms}} can be {{as simple}} as the spring-loaded <b>safety</b> <b>levers</b> on M67 or RGD-5 grenade fuzes, which will not initiate the explosive train so long as the pin is kept in the grenade, or the <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> is held down on a pinless grenade. Alternatively, it {{can be as}} complex as the electronic timer-countdown on an influence sea mine, which gives the vessel laying it sufficient time to move out of the blast zone before the magnetic or acoustic sensors are fully activated.|$|R
5000|$|Llama M-87: Manufactured from 1986 to 1997. Self-loading pistol, {{original}} design with Beretta falling-block type locked breech, in 9 mm parabellum with double-stack 15-round magazine.

Despite the high price, the M-87 was greeted with excellent reviews on release ...|$|R
50|$|The {{rubber band}} grenade was another booby trap. To make this device, a Viet Cong guerrilla would wrap a strong rubber band around the {{spring-loaded}} <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> {{of a hand}} grenade and remove the pin. The grenade was then hidden in a hut. American and South Vietnamese soldiers would burn huts regularly {{to prevent them from}} being inhabited again, or to expose foxholes and tunnel entrances, which were frequently concealed within these structures. When a hut with the booby trap was torched, the rubber band on the grenade would melt, releasing the <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> and blowing up the hut. This would often wound the soldiers with burning bamboo and metal fragments. This booby trap was also used to destroy vehicles when the modified grenade was placed in the fuel tank. The rubber band would be eaten away by the chemical action of the fuel, releasing the <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> and detonating the grenade.|$|R
25|$|Omni III: Manufactured {{approximately}} 1980–1986. Self-loading pistol, {{original design}} with Browning 1935-type locked breech, in 9mm Parabellum with double column 13-round magazine. Numerous modern {{features such as}} de-cocker <b>safety</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|R
25|$|Omni I: Manufactured from {{approximately}} 1980–1986. Self-loading pistol, original design with Browning 1935-type locked breech, in 45 ACP with single column seven-round magazine. Numerous modern {{features such as}} de-cocker <b>safety</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|R

50|$|The M33 was the {{original}} successor to the M26 fragmentation grenade. It was essentially identical to the M67, but lacked the safety clip that is fitted to the <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> of the M67.|$|R
2500|$|The FS {{models are}} Double-action/Single-action (DA/SA) pistols; {{they have an}} initial {{double-action}} trigger pull subsequently followed by single-action operation. The [...] "FS" [...] models have a <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> that also functions as a decocking lever.|$|R
5000|$|The trigger {{mechanism}} displays an adjustable trigger pull of [...] The <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> is located behind the bolt handle {{and the safety}} locks the trigger, immobilizes the sear and prevents the rotary bolt from turning.|$|R
50|$|The revolver, {{somewhat}} {{unusual for}} the type of weapon, features a manual <b>safety</b> <b>lever.</b> It also features Pachmayr decelerator grips. The Thunder 5 comes in either matte or bright stainless steel finish and has fixed sights.|$|R
50|$|Another variant was the Mason jar grenade. The {{safety pin}} of hand grenades would be pulled and the grenades {{would be placed}} in glass Ball Mason jars, which would hold back the <b>safety</b> <b>lever.</b> The <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> would release upon the {{shattering}} of the jar and the grenade would detonate. This particular variant was popular with helicopter warfare, and were used as improvised anti-personnel cluster bombs during air raids. They were easy to dump out of the flight door over a target, and the thick Ball Mason glass was resistant to premature shattering. They could also be partially filled with gasoline or jellied gasoline, Napalm, to add to their destructive nature.|$|R
50|$|In 1945 the CZ-36 was {{redesigned}} by Jan Kratochvil to make {{it easier}} (hence cheaper) to manufacture and became the Vzor 45 (model 1945) but is generally known as CZ-45. The <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> which had sometimes appeared on the CZ-36 was eliminated (though a few early model 45s were manufactured with a <b>safety</b> <b>lever).</b> The changes included the addition of a side plate to simplify assembly and a magazine safety. The CZ-36 had a connector from the trigger to the hammer that ran {{on the left side of}} the magazine, whereas the CZ-45 has a Browning style stirrup-shaped connector that runs on both sides of the magazine.|$|R
50|$|Improved safety: The design {{prevents}} a round {{from moving}} within or {{falling out of}} the barrel, even if the muzzle looks down. The GP-34 features an additional mechanism (firing pin <b>safety</b> <b>lever)</b> to improve <b>safety</b> during loading.|$|R
