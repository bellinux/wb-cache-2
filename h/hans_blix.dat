5|$|In late 2002 {{and early}} 2003, Bush urged the United Nations to enforce Iraqi {{disarmament}} mandates, precipitating a diplomatic crisis. In November 2002, <b>Hans</b> <b>Blix</b> and Mohamed ElBaradei led UN weapons inspectors in Iraq, but were advised by the U.S. to depart the country four {{days prior to}} the U.S. invasion, despite their requests for more time to complete their tasks. The U.S. initially sought a UN Security Council resolution authorizing {{the use of military}} force but dropped the bid for UN approval due to vigorous opposition from several countries.|$|E
25|$|ElBaradei {{began to}} serve as Director General of the IAEA, {{which is based in}} Vienna, on 1 December 1997, {{succeeding}} <b>Hans</b> <b>Blix</b> of Sweden. He was re-elected for two more four-year terms in 2001 and in 2005. His third and last term ended in November 2009. ElBaradei's tenure has been marked by high-profile, non-proliferation issues, which include the inspections in Iraq preceding the March 2003 invasion, and tensions over the nuclear program of Iran.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the major}} issues during ElBaradei’s second term as the {{director}} general of the IAEA was the agency’s inspections in Iraq. ElBaradei disputed the U.S. rationale for the 2003 invasion of Iraq {{from the time of the}} 2002 Iraq disarmament crisis, when he, along with <b>Hans</b> <b>Blix,</b> led a team of UN weapons inspectors in Iraq. ElBaradei told the UN Security Council in March 2003 that documents purporting to show that Iraq had tried to acquire uranium from Niger were not authentic.|$|E
5000|$|Before the invasion, {{the then}} UK Attorney General Lord Goldsmith, advised {{that the war}} would be in breach of {{international}} law for six reasons, ranging {{from the lack of}} a second United Nations resolution to UN inspector <b>Hans</b> <b>Blix's</b> continuing search for weapons. Ten days later on 7 March 2003, as UK troops were massing in Kuwait, Lord Goldsmith changed his mind, saying: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{commonly}} articulated reasons included: {{a belief}} that the UN process (including <b>Hans</b> <b>Blix's</b> inspections) should be allowed to reach its natural conclusion, an aversion to America's neo-con bellicosity, {{a belief that}} the threat posed by Iraq was being exaggerated, a preference for multilateralism, a belief that war might just [...] "serve as a recruiting sergeant for Al-Qaida", and fear of the [...] "fog of war" [...] i.e. the uncertain and unpredictable consequences of invading another country.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Hans</b> Martin <b>Blix</b> ( [...] ; born 28 June 1928) is a Swedish diplomat and {{politician}} for the Liberal People's Party. He was Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs (1978–1979) {{and later}} became {{the head of the}} International Atomic Energy Agency. As such, Blix was the first Western representative to inspect the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster in the Soviet Union on site, and led the agency response to them. Blix was also the head of the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission from March 2000 to June 2003, when he was succeeded by Dimitris Perrikos. In 2002, the commission began searching Iraq for weapons of mass destruction, ultimately finding none. In February 2010, Blix became head of the United Arab Emirates' [...] advisory board for its nuclear power program.|$|R
25|$|Blix {{was born}} in Uppsala, Sweden. He {{is the son of}} {{professor}} Gunnar Blix and Hertha Wiberg, and grandson of professor Magnus Blix. He comes from a family of Jamtlandic origin. Blix studied at Uppsala University and Columbia University, earning his PhD from the University of Cambridge (Trinity Hall). In 1959, he earned a Juris Doctor in International Law at Stockholm University, where he was appointed Associate Professor in International Law the next year. <b>Hans</b> <b>Blix</b> has two sons, Mårten and Göran, who both have doctoral degrees.|$|E
25|$|As the {{dominant}} academic institution in Sweden for several centuries, Uppsala University has ever since its first period of {{expansion in the}} early part of the 17th century educated a large proportion of Swedish politicians and civil servants, from 17th century Chancellor of the Realm (rikskansler) Johan Oxenstierna (1611–1657) and Lord Chief Justice (riksdrots) Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie (1622–1686) to the first Social Democratic Prime Minister of Sweden, Hjalmar Branting (1860–1925) and many later politicians. Other alumni are Dag Hammarskjöld (1905–1961), United Nations Secretary General who was (posthumously) awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1961, and the Swedish diplomat <b>Hans</b> <b>Blix</b> (born 1928), who was Head of the International Atomic Energy Agency 1981–1997, of the UNMOVIC 2000–2003, and previously Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs 1978–1979. Hammarskjöld and Blix both graduated from the Uppsala Faculty of Law, as did the Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs Anna Lindh, who was assassinated in 2003.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} after 1998 when UNSCOM was kicked out by the {{government}} of Saddam Hussein and during the Iraq disarmament crisis, in which the United States blamed UNSCOM and former IAEA director <b>Hans</b> <b>Blix</b> for failing to properly disarm Iraq, Scott Ritter the former UNSCOM chief weapons inspector, blamed Annan for being slow and ineffective in enforcing Security Council resolutions on Iraq and was overtly submissive {{to the demands of the}} Clinton administration for regime removal and inspection of sites, often Presidential palaces, that were not mandated in any resolution and were of questionable intelligence value, which severely hampered UNSCOM's ability to cooperate with the Iraqi government and contributed to their expulsion from the country. Ritter also claimed that Annan regularly interfered with the work of the inspectors and diluted the chain of command by trying to micromanage all of the activities of UNSCOM, which caused intelligence processing (and the resulting inspections) to be backed up and caused confusion with the Iraqis as to who was in charge and as a result, they generally refused to take orders from Ritter or Rolf Ekéus without explicit approval from Annan, which could have taken days, if not weeks. He later believed that Annan was oblivious to the fact the Iraqis took advantage of this in order to delay inspections. He claimed that on one occasion, Annan refused to implement a no-notice inspection of the SSO headquarters and instead tried to negotiate access, but the negotiation ended up taking nearly six weeks, giving the Iraqis more than enough time to clean out the site.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the passing}} of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441, which demanded that Iraq give [...] "immediate, {{unconditional}} and active cooperation" [...] with UN and IAEA inspections, Saddam allowed U.N. weapons inspectors led by <b>Hans</b> <b>Blix</b> to return to Iraq.

2500|$|In February 2009 IAEA Director General {{reportedly}} {{said that}} he believed {{the possibility of a}} military attack on Iran's nuclear installations had been ruled out. [...] "Force can only be used as a last option... when all other political possibilities have been exhausted," [...] he told Radio France International. Former Director General <b>Hans</b> <b>Blix</b> criticized Western governments for the years lost by their [...] "ineffective approaches" [...] to Iran's nuclear program. Blix suggested the West offer [...] "guarantees against attacks from the outside and subversive activities inside" [...] and also suggested U.S. involvement in regional diplomacy [...] "would offer Iran a greater incentive to reach a nuclear agreement than the Bush team's statements that 'Iran must behave itself'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Finally, Swedish {{politicians}} and diplomats {{across party lines}} have been very outspoken about nonproliferation and disarmament. The most well-known individuals include Dr. <b>Hans</b> <b>Blix,</b> Rolf Ekéus, and Henrik Salander, who have chaired, or currently chair, the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, the United Nations Special Commission, and the Middle Powers Initiative, respectively. Additionally, the late Anna Lindh, Sweden's former minister for foreign affairs, {{took the lead in}} promotion of non-proliferation policy, which eventually affected the European Union's strategy to combat the {{proliferation of weapons of mass}} destruction (WMD). Lindh also instigated the International WMD Commission, chaired by Blix, which in 2006 released its study, which offers [...] over 60 recommendations on how to reduce the threat posed by WMD. [...] The negotiations resulted in the non-proliferation treaty, which was ready for signature in 1968. Sweden signed the treaty on 19 August 1968, immediately after West Germany had done the same.|$|E
2500|$|Resolution 1441 gave Iraq [...] "a final {{opportunity}} {{to comply with}} its disarmament obligations" [...] and set up inspections by the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Saddam accepted the resolution on 13 November and inspectors returned to Iraq {{under the direction of}} UNMOVIC chairman <b>Hans</b> <b>Blix</b> and IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei. As of February 2003, the IAEA [...] "found no evidence or plausible indication of the revival of a nuclear weapons program in Iraq"; the IAEA concluded that certain items which could have been used in nuclear enrichment centrifuges, such as aluminum tubes, were in fact intended for other uses. UNMOVIC [...] "did not find evidence of the continuation or resumption of programs of weapons of mass destruction" [...] or significant quantities of proscribed items. UNMOVIC did supervise the destruction of a small number of empty chemical rocket warheads, 50liters of mustard gas that had been declared by Iraq and sealed by UNSCOM in 1998, and laboratory quantities of a mustard gas precursor, along with about 50 Al-Samoud missiles of a design that Iraq stated did not exceed the permitted 150km range, but which had travelled up to 183km in tests. Shortly before the invasion, UNMOVIC stated that it would take [...] "months" [...] to verify Iraqi compliance with resolution 1441.|$|E
