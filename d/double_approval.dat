The edge $ab$ is in the graph if the intervals corresponding to the vertices $a$ and $b$ intersect, and neither contains the veto mark of the other. We find families of graphs which are VI graphs, and prove results towards characterizing the maximum chromatic number of a VI graph. We define and prove similar results about several related graph families, including unit VI graphs, midpoint unit VI (MUVI) graphs, and single and <b>double</b> <b>approval</b> graphs. We also highlight a relationship between approval graphs and a family of tolerance graphs...|$|E
50|$|A <b>double</b> {{majority}} requires <b>approval</b> by {{a majority}} of individuals voting, and also {{by a majority}} of cantons. Thus, in Switzerland a citizen-proposed amendment to the federal constitution (i.e. popular initiative) cannot be passed at the federal level if a majority of the people approve but a majority of the cantons disapprove. For referendums or propositions in general terms (like the principle of a general revision of the Constitution), a majority of those voting is sufficient (Swiss Constitution, 2005).|$|R
50|$|In 2015, 45 {{new drugs}} were {{passed by the}} FDA, {{which is more than}} <b>double</b> than the <b>approval</b> rate 10 years ago. The 21st Century Cures Act could make this number a trend rather than {{aberration}} by expediting approval through lower standards, much like the FDA Modernization Act of 1997. The rationale behind the act is that urgency trumps risk for “breakthrough” medical devices. The act would allow producers to submit data other than official clinical trials for consideration, such as case histories. It would also allow reviews to be done by third parties instead of the FDA. Debates stem from the fact that approval could be based on anecdotal rather than scientific evidence.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Objective: To {{evaluate}} the FDA’s approval process and postmarket surveillance strategies for THR devices. Design: The FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) 510 k releasable database {{was used to}} document approved THR devices. The CDRH Medical Device Reporting data files were used to study {{the efficiency of the}} FDA’s post-market surveillance system. Manufacturers were contacted to supply information regarding their implants. Medline was searched between 1966 - 1996 to determine the percentage of THR devices with published data on clinical outcomes. Results: Between 1976 and 1996, 701 new THR devices were approved by the Substantial Equivalent (SE) route and 34 were approved on the basis of Premarket Approval PMA. The number of <b>approvals</b> <b>doubled</b> between 1991 - 1995 compared to 1976 - 1990. Seventy-four different manufacturers obtained approval to market THR devices. Only four manufacturers obtained approval via the PMA application. Under Mandatory Device Reporting all revision arthroplasties should be reported. Using data from 2 independent services for which we had US hospital discharge data in 1993 we estimate that only 3 % of all revision THR were reported to the FDA. Manufacturers of hip implants failed to provide useful information. Medline search revealed only 15 % of the approved THR devices had published data on outcomes. Conclusion: Current FDA premarket approval and postmarket surveillance strategies fail to provide information for evidence-base...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impacts of}} small and medium scale wind turbines upon bats. Global efforts to address climate change have recently introduced {{a new source of}} fatality risk to bats, from wind turbines. Bat fatalities have now been confirmed in varying magnitudes at wind energy facilities around the world. Research at large turbines and wind farms has started to produce a knowledge base regarding impacts upon bats, though many questions remain. Little, however, is known about risk levels at small and medium scale wind turbines. Equally, research regarding the impacts of turbines in the UK is limited. This thesis {{examines the}} impacts of small and medium scale wind turbines upon bats. Planning records of wind turbines in Wales and south west (SW) England were reviewed. Approved planning applications for single and double turbine sites were found to greatly outnumber those for larger scale wind farms. The large majority of single and <b>double</b> turbine <b>approvals</b> were also for small turbines. The potential impacts of turbine presence and density on current bat roost populations and population changes were analysed, finding no impact. An estimate of bat fatality rates at small and medium turbines was calculated, using a trained search dog to locate carcasses. An average fatality rate between 0. 81 and 15. 15 turbine- 1 year- 1 was estimated. The higher rate accounted for uncertainty in the monitoring protocol. Only 3 bat carcasses were however observed across all monitored turbines, suggesting more stringent monitoring would likely confirm a lower maximum annual fatality rate. Bat activity levels were also compared between the turbine location and differing habitat types. A disturbance effect was consequently identified in proximity to turbines during high wind speeds. Finally moderating influences of environmental weather and habitat conditions upon bat activity were confirmed. Social Network Analysis (SNA) methods were used to analyse bat movement networks within a small grid of bat detectors centred on each turbine. Associations were identified between bats’ movement routes and habitat structures present at sites, highlighting vulnerabilities to disruption. Furthermore bats actively used the turbine area, potentially for foraging purposes. Finally by assessing bats’ activity levels in response to a turbine noise playback experiment, small turbine noise was found to have no impact upon bat activity. Planning guidance regarding bats and small and medium turbines is highlighted as a priority for policy development. Natural Resources WalesNatural Environment Research Council (NERC...|$|R
40|$|I am {{absolutely}} delighted, {{as well as}} obviously honored, {{to be asked to}} deliver this year’s lecture honoring the career of former Lincoln native and Nebraska College of Law Dean Roscoe Pound. One could speak of many facets of his career, {{one of the most important}} in the first half of the twentieth century. I want to draw a certain inspiration from one of his most famous interventions in public debate, his 1906 address to the American Bar Association on “The Causes of Popular Dissatisfaction with the Administration of Justice. ” I will not be speaking today specifically about the administration of justice, at least in the sense that Pound used it to refer to the justice administered by courts. Much of my recent work has been motivated, however, by “popular dissatisfaction” with the operation of our political system, particularly at the national level. I began my most recent book, Framed: America’s Fifty-One Constitutions and the Crisis of Governance, with a litany of quotations from a variety of pundits and analysts across the political spectrum who describe the contemporary national political system as “dysfunctional” or even, as New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman put it, “pathological. ” 4 A variety of recent polls conducted since I finished that book about fourteen months ago certainly suggest a similar and continuing public perception. For example, as I write these remarks at the end of July 2013, a compilation of polls taken throughout the month indicated that approximately 16 % of the public “approved” of Congress, while a bit over 76 % “disapproved,” a gap of 60 %. 5 As a matter of fact, Congress has generally not enjoyed majority approval since 1998; interestingly enough, the temporary high of over 80 % was reached in the halcyon days immediately after September 11, 2001, nearly <b>doubling</b> the <b>approval</b> rate of only 42 % in a poll completed on September 10. 6 Since then, it has literally been downhill so far as the slope of approval is concerned. The current approval rate of nearly 15 % is actually a quite dramatic jump, in one sense, from August 2012, when the Gallup Organization noted that the number had reached a “historic low” of 10 %. So with these remarks as the introduction that supplies the context within which I am thinking, I come to the significance of my specific title and its emphasis on “reflection and choice. ” As important as the Philadelphia Convention was, it did not, in terms of legal fact, give us a new Constitution. All the Framers could do was to propose the replacement of the Articles of Confederation. 37 Ratification was the prerogative of the delegates chosen by a relatively broad—at least for the time—electorate to attend the state conventions mandated by Article VII of the new Constitution. 38 That Article itself was a radical rejection of the requirement in the Articles of Confederation that any amendment be validated by the unanimous consent of the state legislatures. It was just this guarantee, seemingly set out in Article XIII of the Articles of Confederation, 39 coupled with their fear that the Convention would “detract even further” from the stature of the Congress established by the Articles, which presumably encouraged Rhode Islanders to refuse to send any delegates at all to Philadelphia. 40 Rhode Islanders were, of course, absolutely correct about the potential consequences of the Convention but absolutely incorrect that Rhode Islanders would have the opportunity to exercise the veto ostensibly guaranteed them by Article XIII. Perhaps the single most important decision made in Philadelphia is indeed found in Article VII, inasmuch as it rendered irrelevant what Rhode Islanders thought of the new Constitution...|$|R

Durante o estudo foram avaliados três sistemas de revestimento orgânico interno da embalagem, sendo o primeiro composto de verniz epóxi-fenólico líquido aplicado na folha plana e verniz epóxi-vinílico-acrilado líquido aplicado na região da solda; o segundo um verniz epóxi-fenólico líquido aplicado na folha plana, verniz epóxi-vinílico-acrilado líquido aplicado na solda e uma segunda camada de verniz epóxi modificado líquido, aplicado por spray após a formação da lata e o terceiro um verniz líquido epóxi-fenólico aplicado na folha plana e verniz poliéster em pó aplicado na solda, denominados latas Normal, Repair e Pó, respectivamente. As embalagens foram caracterizadas quanto ao tipo de {{material}} metálico (espessura, dureza e camadas de estanho e cromo), avaliação do fechamento (recravação), atendimento aos requisitos de embalagens para contato com alimentos previstos pela Legislação Brasileira e pelo MERCOSUL e caracterização dos revestimentos orgânicos do corpo, tampa, fundo e side stripe, em relação à camada seca, identificação, aderência, porosidade e grau de cura. O teste de estocagem foi realizado pelo período de 6 meses em duas condições de temperatura controlada, 25 oC ± 2 °C e 35 oC ± 3 oC, com avaliações periódicas a intervalos de 15 dias no primeiro mês, 30 dias no segundo mês e de 60 dias até completar 180 dias de estocagem. Os parâmetros de avaliação periódica foram aparência visual interna das latas, nível de vácuo, composição de gases (O 2, N 2, CO 2 e H 2) no espaço-livre da embalagem, avaliação sensorial, avaliação instrumental de cor, pH, acidez, estimativa dos sólidos solúveis (°Brix), concentração de ferro, estanho e cromo no suco de maracujá e conteúdo de vitamina C, sendo que este último foi determinado apenas ao zero dia, 15 e 180 dias de estocagem. Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to evaluate different specifications of welded three piece tinplate cans with respect to the internal body passion fruit juice. The evaluation was by a storage test, evaluating the performance relative to food/packaging interaction. Three systems of internal organic coatings of the cans were analyzed. The first was composed of a liquid epoxy-phenolic lacquer applied to the flat tinplate and liquid epoxyvinillic-acrylate lacquer applied to the side stripe. The second type was a liquid epoxyphenolic lacquer applied to the flat tinplate and a liquid epoxy-vinillic-acrylate lacquer applied to the side stripe and a second layer of liquid modified epoxy lacquer, applied by spraying after the formation of the can. The third type was a liquid epoxy-phenolic lacquer applied to the flat tinplate and a powdered polyester lacquer applied to the side stripe. The systems were denominated Normal, Repair and Pó, respectively. The cans were characterized according to the type of metallic material (thickness, hardness and tin and chromium layers), evaluation of the <b>double</b> seams, <b>approval</b> for contact with foodstuffs in accordance with the procedures and rules of the Brazilian and MERCOSUR Legislation and evaluation of the organic coatings of the body, bottom, end and side stripe, in relation to the internal lacquer weight, porosity, identification, adherence and curing degree. The storage test was conducted during a period of 6 months under two conditions of controlled temperature, 25 °C ± 2 °C and 35 °C ± 3 °C, with evaluations at intervals of 15 days during the first month, 30 days up to the second month and then every 60 days to complete 180 days of storage. The parameters included in the evaluations were visual internal appearance of the cans, vacuum level, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and hydrogen composition of the cans headspace, sensorial analysis, instrumental evaluation of color, pH, total titratable acidity, soluble solids (°Brix), iron, tin and chromium concentration in the passion fruit juice and ascorbic acid content (vitamin C), which was only determined at zero day and after 15 and 180 days of storage. The results showed that all cans presented no restriction for use in contact with aqueous acid foodstuffs (pH < 5; 0) at processing temperatures of up to 100 ºC, followed by prolonged use at temperatures of up to 40 ºC. The results for vacuum level, pH, acidity and soluble solids in the juice remarried stable at the two temperatures throughout storage. In the same period at both temperatures, there was a decrease in vitamin content and a slight darkening of the juice. The alterations observed in the visual internal evaluation and the increase in hydrogen concentration in the can headspace and iron and tin concentrations in the juice, demonstrated the beginning of internal can corrosion. The sensorial evaluation demonstrated a loss of quality of the juice packed in the three cans, mainly in the cans stored at 35 °C, but all juices maintained acceptable quality up to the 180 th day of storage. The storage test showed that the three kinds of cans presented good performance for the packaging of passion fruit juice and that the sample with powdered lacquer on the side stripe presented a worse performance than the other two systems studied, due to the smaller protection offered by the lacquer applied to the body. The study allowed for the conclusion that the three packages studied could be used in the packaging of passion fruit juice with a shelf life of up to 6 months...|$|R
