Three {{people were killed and}} forty-seven others injured. Cars were reportedly <b>flipped</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> air and debris scattered over several blocks. An investigation of the cause of the disaster uncovered leaks in a pipe running below the building, which supplied propane to the heating system for the complex.

500|$|Piano Concerto No. 2 was {{directed}} by Butoy with art director Michael Humphries. It originated in the 1930s when Walt Disney wished to adapt a collection of Hans Christian Andersen fairy tales into an animated film. The artists completed a series of preliminary designs based on the stories, including ones for The Steadfast Tin Soldier from 1938 by Bianca Majolie that were stored in the studio's animation research library and used for a 1991 Disney book that retold the story accompanied with the storyboard sketches. When Disney suggested using the Shostakovich piece, Butoy <b>flipped</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> book and found the story's structure fit to the music. When Humphries saw the sketches he designed the segment with works by Caravaggio and Rembrandt in mind to give the segment a [...] "timeless" [...] feel, while keeping the colors [...] "as romantic as possible" [...] during the scenes when the soldier and ballerina are first getting acquainted. Live action footage of a real ballerina {{was used as a}} guide for the toy ballerina's movements. Butoy found the Jack-in-a-box a difficult character to design and animate with its spring base and how he moved with the box. His appearance went through numerous changes, partly {{due to the lack of}} reference material available to the team.|$|E

5000|$|US Highway 31A (US 31A) was an {{alternate}} route through Muskegon. The designation was first commissioned in 1932 for a highway that bypassed downtown Muskegon to the east.

US 31A continued northeasterly along Muskegon Avenue back to US 31 at Marquette Avenue.
