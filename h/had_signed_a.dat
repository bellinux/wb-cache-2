5|$|Allardyce {{was offered}} the Manchester City job, but the offer was {{withdrawn}} after Thaksin Shinawatra's purchase offer of the club was accepted. On 15 May 2007, Newcastle United announced that Allardyce <b>had</b> <b>signed</b> <b>a</b> three-year contract to succeed Glenn Roeder as manager. Ironically Newcastle then also {{had a change of}} owners, as Mike Ashley completed his takeover of the club. The sales of Scott Parker and Kieron Dyer raised £13million, allowing Allardyce to sign Australia international striker Mark Viduka (free transfer), utility man Alan Smith (£6million), midfielder Geremi Njitap, controversial midfielder Joey Barton (£5.5million), left-back José Enrique (£6.3million), right-back Habib Beye (£2million), and defender Abdoulaye Faye. Newcastle enjoyed a good start to the season, beating Allardyce's former club Bolton 3–1 on the opening day in a run of five wins and two draws from the opening nine league games. However they then had a series of disappointing results in the run-up to Christmas, and after gaining only one point from a possible six from bottom-of-the-table Wigan and Derby. Allardyce parted company with Newcastle United on 9 January 2008. He had gone into the meeting with chairman Chris Mort expecting to be told Newcastle <b>had</b> <b>signed</b> <b>a</b> new player, not expecting that Ashley and Mort had decided to instead sign Kevin Keegan to return as manager.|$|E
