40|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines (ICE) are combined {{with electric motors}} and batteries in both hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) to improve efficiency and allow a limited all electric range. This paper quan- tifies the electrical power needed for charging a fleet of PHEVs in Belgium. A stochastic model based on the driving behavior of Western European drivers, determines {{the availability of the}} PHEVs for charging from grid. Three scenarios are defined to generate charging profiles based on the driving profiles. The scenarios are based on current tariff schemes available to residential users, which only includes a <b>day</b> and <b>night</b> <b>tariff.</b> Therefore, the management or coordination of the PHEVs is diffucult based on these tariffs. Two scenarios are based on the current single tariff schemes; the distinction between them is the availability of a charging connection at the work place. The third scenario is a <b>day</b> and <b>night</b> <b>tariff.</b> As <b>night</b> work is not that popular, there is no effectual difference whether or not a charging connection at work is available. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{charging}} of batteries of plug-in hybrid {{electric vehicles}} at home at standard outlets {{has an impact on}} the distribution grid which may require serious investments in grid expansion. The coordination of the charging gives an improvement of the grid exploitation in terms of reduced power losses and voltage deviations with respect to uncoordinated charging. The vehicles must be dispatchable to achieve the most efficient solution. As the exact forecasting of household loads is not possible, stochastic programming is introduced. Two main techniques are analyzed in this paper: quadratic and dynamic programming. Both techniques are compared in results and storage requirements. The charging can be coordinated directly or indirectly by the grid utility or an aggregator who will sell the aggregated demand of PHEVs at the utility. PHEVs can also discharge and so inject energy in the grid to restrict voltage drops. The amount of energy that is injected in the grid depends on the price tariffs, the charging and discharging efficiencies and the battery energy content. The impact of a voltage controller embedded in a PHEV charger is regarded in this paper. A <b>day</b> and <b>night</b> <b>tariff</b> are applied. The charging and discharging of vehicles can respond to real-time pricing or on a price-schedule as well. Voltage control {{is the first step in}} the utilization of distributed resources like PHEVs for ancillary services. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to provide insight into the {{variations}} in dairy farm electricity costs across five electricity tariffs. The effect of four milk cooling scenarios is also simulated to illustrate the effect of technologies on the electricity consumption, related costs and CO 2 emissions of a dairy farm. Helping dairy farmers to make informed business decisions when confronted with future options in the sphere of electricity tariffs and energy efficient cooling systems will contribute to optimum farm profitability and will help to improve the profitability and sustainability of the industry. A previously developed model capable of simulating electricity consumption, related costs and CO 2 emissions of dairy farms was used to simulate five electricity tariffs (Flat, Day&Night, Time of Use Tariff 1 (TOU 1), TOU 2 and Real Time Pricing (RTP)) on a dairy farm with 195 milking cows. The Flat tariff consisted on one electricity price for all time periods, the Day&Night tariff consisted of two electricity prices, a high rate from 09 : 00 to 00 : 00 h and a low rate thereafter. The TOU tariff structure was similar to that of the Day&Night tariff except that a third peak price band was introduced between 17 : 00 and 19 : 00 h. The RTP tariff varied dynamically according to the electricity demand on the national grid. The model used in these simulations is a mechanistic mathematical representation of the electricity consumption that simulates farm equipment under the following headings; milk cooling system, water heating system, milking machine system, lighting systems, water pump systems and the winter housing facilities. Direct expansion, ice bank and pre-cooling milk cooling systems were simulated to determine how dairy farm electricity consumption, related costs and CO 2 emissions vary according to the milk cooling system installed on the farm. Annual simulated electricity consumption of the farm was 32, 670 kWh when a direct expansion milk cooling system without pre-cooling of milk was included in the model. The annual electricity consumption of the farm on the <b>day</b> & <b>night</b> <b>tariff</b> was € 4, 571. Adding precooling with ground water to the direct expansion milk cooling system reduced annual electricity consumption by 28 % to 23, 660 kWh and reduced annual electricity costs by 38 % to € 2, 875. The addition of a pre-cooling system to the direct expansion milk cooling system saved 3, 973 kg of CO 2. Simulation of an ice bank milk cooling system without pre-cooling resulted in annual simulated electricity consumption of 34, 777 kWh. The annual electricity consumption on the <b>day</b> & <b>night</b> <b>tariff</b> was € 3, 793. Adding pre-cooling with ground water to the ice bank milk cooling system reduced annual electricity consumption by 30 % to 24, 181 kWh and reduced annual electricity costs by 33 % to € 2, 527. The addition of a pre-cooling system to the ice bank milk cooling system saved 5, 044 kg of CO 2...|$|R
40|$|Internal	combustion	engines	(ICE) 	are	combined with {{electric}} motors and batteries in both hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) to improve efficiency and achieve a limited all electric range. This paper determines the electrical power required for charging a fleet of PHEVs in Belgium. A stochastic model based on the driving be- havior of Western European drivers, determines {{the availability of the}} PHEVs for grid charging. Three scenarios are defined to generate charging profiles based on the driving profiles. The first two scenarios, defined as uncoordinated charging, are based on a continuation of the current tariff schemes available to residential users, i. e. a single electricity tariff or a double electricity tariff including a <b>day</b> and <b>night</b> <b>tariff.</b> In the third scenario, coordinated charging is proposed. When coordinated charging is applied, the time of charging is shifted to a more appropriate moment of the night where total electrical load is minimal. The charging energy when coordinated charging is applied for each PHEV is defined to be equal to that of the single tariff scenario. The extra load caused by charging PHEVs is added to the residential and industrial electricity consumption of Belgium in 2008. Based on this data, a year load duration diagram can be determined to quantify demand for both power and energy in base load, variable load and peak load. Uncoordinated charging for residential users will cause difficulties for the electricity production system because peak load will rise substantially while base load stays the same. Coordinated charging is essential to minimize the impact on the electricity production system and could be implemented using smart meter technology. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Our {{objective}} was to define and demonstrate a mechanistic model that enables dairy farmers to explore {{the impact of a}} technical or managerial innovation on electricity consumption, associated CO 2 emissions, and electricity costs. We, therefore, (1) defined a model for electricity consumption on dairy farms (MECD) capable of simulating total electricity consumption along with related CO 2 emissions and electricity costs on dairy farms on a monthly basis; (2) validated the MECD using empirical data of 1 yr on commercial spring calving, grass-based dairy farms with 45, 88, and 195 milking cows; and (3) demonstrated the functionality of the model by applying 2 electricity tariffs to the electricity consumption data and examining the effect on total dairy farm electricity costs. The MECD was developed using a mechanistic modeling approach and required the key inputs of milk production, cow number, and details relating to the milk-cooling system, milking machine system, water-heating system, lighting systems, water pump systems, and the winter housing facilities as well as details relating to the management of the farm (e. g., season of calving). Model validation showed an overall relative prediction error (RPE) of less than 10 % for total electricity consumption. More than 87 % of the mean square prediction error of total electricity consumption was accounted for by random variation. The RPE values of the milk-cooling systems, water-heating systems, and milking machine systems were less than 20 %. The RPE values for automatic scraper systems, lighting systems, and water pump systems varied from 18 to 113 %, indicating a poor prediction for these metrics. However, automatic scrapers, lighting, and water pumps made up only 14 % of total electricity consumption across all farms, reducing the overall impact of these poor predictions. Demonstration of the model showed that total farm electricity costs increased by between 29 and 38 % by moving from a <b>day</b> and <b>night</b> <b>tariff</b> to a flat tariff...|$|R
