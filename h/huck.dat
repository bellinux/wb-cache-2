25|$|Rather {{than simply}} sneaking Jim {{out of the}} shed where he is being held, Tom {{develops}} an elaborate plan to free him, involving secret messages, a hidden tunnel, snakes in a shed, a rope ladder sent in Jim's food, and other elements from adventure books he has read, including an anonymous note to the Phelps warning them of the whole scheme. During the actual escape and resulting pursuit, Tom is shot in the leg, while Jim remains by his side, risking recapture rather than completing his escape alone. Although a local doctor admires Jim's decency, he has Jim arrested in his sleep {{and returned to the}} Phelps. After this, events quickly resolve themselves. Tom's Aunt Polly arrives and reveals <b>Huck</b> and Tom's true identities to the Phelps family. Jim is revealed to be a free man: Miss Watson died two months earlier and freed Jim in her will, but Tom (who already knew this) chose not to reveal this information to <b>Huck</b> so that he could come up with an artful rescue plan for Jim. Jim tells <b>Huck</b> that Huck's father (Pap Finn) has been dead for some time (he was the dead man they found earlier in the floating house), and so <b>Huck</b> may now return safely to St. Petersburg. <b>Huck</b> is rewarded six hundred dollars for saving the aunts from the con men. <b>Huck</b> gives most of it to Jim for his family. <b>Huck</b> declares that he is quite glad to be done writing his story, and despite Sally's plans to adopt and civilize him, he intends to flee west to Indian Territory.|$|E

To match accounts of Wilks's brothers, the king attempts an English accent and the duke {{pretends to be}} a deaf-mute while starting to collect Wilks's inheritance. <b>Huck</b> decides that Wilks's three orphaned nieces, who treat <b>Huck</b> with kindness, do not deserve to be cheated thus and so he tries to retrieve for them the stolen inheritance. In a desperate moment, <b>Huck</b> is forced to hide the money in Wilks's coffin, which is abruptly buried the next morning. The arrival of two new men {{who seem to be}} the real brothers throws everything into confusion, so that the townspeople decide to dig up the coffin in order to determine which are the true brothers, but, with everyone else distracted, <b>Huck</b> leaves for the raft, hoping to never see the duke and king again. Suddenly, though, the two villains return, much to Huck's despair. When <b>Huck</b> is finally able to get away a second time, he finds to his horror that the swindlers have sold Jim away to a family that intends to return him to his proper owner for the reward. Defying his conscience and accepting the negative religious consequences he expects for his actionsâ€”"All right, then, I'll go to hell!"â€”Huck resolves to free Jim once and for all.|$|E
