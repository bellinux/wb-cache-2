40|$|Abstract <b>For</b> <b>swimming</b> <b>pools,</b> it is {{generally}} agreed that free chlorine levels have to be mainted in order to guarantee adequate disinfection. Recommended free chlorine levels can vary between 0, 3 and 0, 6 mg/L in Germany and up to 3 mg/L in other countries. Bathers introduce considerable amounts of organic matter, mainly {{in the form of}} such as urine and sweat, into the pool water. As a consequence, disinfection byproducts (DBPs) are formed. Regulations in Germany recommend levels of combined chlorine of less than 0, 2 mg/L and levels of trihalomethanes (THMs) of less than 20 µg/L. Haloacetic acids (HAAs), haloacetonitriles (HANs), chloropicrin and chloral hydrate are also detected in considerable amounts. However, these compounds are not regulated yet. <b>Swimming</b> <b>pool</b> staff and swimmers, especially athletes, are primarily exposed to these byproducts by inhalation and/or dermal uptake. In Germany, new regulations <b>for</b> <b>swimming</b> <b>pool</b> water treatment generally require the use of activated carbon. In this project, three different types o...|$|R
