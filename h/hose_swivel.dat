40|$|Abstract: In rotary {{drilling}} operation, the hydraulic circuit typically consists of stand pipe, rotary <b>hose,</b> <b>swivel,</b> Kelly, drill pipe, drill collar, drill bit, and the annulus between the drillstring {{and the open}} hole or the casing. Stand Pipe Pressure, abbreviated as SPP, {{is defined as the}} total frictional pressure drop in the hydraulic circuit. SPP, an important drilling parameter in selecting proper mud weight, can be calculated using different rheological models. In this paper, the results obtained using the four widely used rheological models namely the Newtonian model, the Bingham plastic model, the Power law model and the Herschel-Bulkley model are presented. The rheological data used are collected by performing circulation test while drilling a vertical well in the Po valley, Italy. The rheological constants associated with each of the four models are calculated using regression analysis, For the three flow rates used during the circulation test, SPP has been predicted with a maximum error of 1. 2 % when compared with the measured values. The Bingham plastic model produces best SPP estimates for all the three flow rates for the drilling condition considered...|$|E
40|$|When the {{drilling}} fluid leaves the mud pump, it circulates through the stand pipe, rotary <b>hose,</b> <b>swivel,</b> Kelly, drill pipe, drill collar, bit and the annulus between the drill string {{and the open}} hole or the casing. During drilling fluid circulation, frictional pressure drop occurs in the hydraulic circuit consisting of the elements mentioned earlier. The total pressure drop in the hydraulic circuit {{is known as the}} stand pipe pressure, abbreviated as SPP. Calculation of the SPP is strongly depended on the rheological models and the assumption of their rheological constants. A number of the rheological models are available. Among them, three most widely used in petroleum industry as Bingham Plastic model, Power low model and the Herschel-Bulkely model have been chosen. For predication of SPP we have to consider the rheological constants of drilling fluid because SPP predication is strongly depends on rheological constants. There are two suggestions to determine these rheological constants named as two point regression or field approach and six points’ regression approaches. Most theoretical principles have been reviewed in the earlier chapter of this work. Then our suggestion based on predication of SPP using two and six points regression have been presented at the rest of the chapters. At the end it has been presented weaknesses and conclusions of this work. This project includes 9 main chapters and a large numbers of tables and figures which have been calculated by hydraulic programming in Excel. All these tables and figures have been putted in Appendixes. </p...|$|E

K1 models have a lightweight crushproof <b>hose</b> that <b>swivels</b> both ends, but the K3 Vulcano and Premium have a heavier electric hose that does not swivel at the machine end, so does {{tend to be a}} slightly more unwieldy in use.|$|R
2500|$|Cars {{can build}} up static charge by driving on dry road surfaces. However many tire {{compounds}} contain enough carbon black {{to provide an}} electrical ground which prevents charge build-up. Newer [...] "high mileage" [...] tires use more silica and can increase the buildup of static. A driver who does not discharge static by contacting a conductive part of the car will carry it to the insulated handle of the nozzle and the static potential will eventually be discharged when this purposely-grounded arrangement is put {{into contact with the}} metallic filler neck of the vehicle. Ordinarily, vapor concentrations in the area of this filling operation are below the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the product being dispensed, so the static discharge causes no problem. The problem with ungrounded gas cans results from a combination of vehicular static charge, the potential between the container and the vehicle, and the loose fit between the grounded nozzle and the gas can. This last condition causes a rich vapor concentration in the ullage (the unfilled volume) of the gas can, and a discharge from the can to the grounded hanging hardware (the nozzle, <b>hose,</b> <b>swivels</b> and break-a-ways) can thus occur at a most inopportune point. The Petroleum Equipment Institute has recorded incidents of static-related ignition at refueling sites since early 2000.|$|R
