In 2002, The American Gas Association's main priority was to eliminate double taxation on dividends. AGA analyst Charlie Fritts voiced his {{opinions about the}} opposition of double taxation due to the possible effects it can have on gas companies. The United States tax code has also been seen as problematic by the American Gas Association, mostly because it creates an uneven playing field for companies that pay dividends and gas companies that maintain most of their earnings. Fritts had also viewed double taxation as problematic because the gas utility industry is expected to raise approximately $100 billion in capital in the following 20 years after 2002, which can be hampered if profits (dividends) from investments are highly taxed. The main goal {{was to develop a}} natural gas infrastructure in the United States.

The network was trained using 147 and 173 operational data from one Polish medium-sized city (<b>distribution</b> <b>pipes</b> and house connections, respectively). 50 % of all data was chosen for learning, 25 % for testing and 25 % for validation. In prognosis phase, the best created network used 100 % of 114 and 133 values for testing. Following functions were used to activate neurons in hidden and output layers: linear, logistic, hyperbolic tangent, exponential. The learning of the artificial network was performed using following input parameters: material, total length, diameter. In the optimal models hyperbolic tangent was chosen to activate the hidden and output neurons in modeling the availability indicator of house connections during 68 epochs of training.

40|$|Acute {{aluminum}} encephalopathy in a dialysis center {{caused by}} a cement mortar water <b>distribution</b> <b>pipe.</b> BackgroundIn Curaçao, distilled seawater from the water plant was used without further purification for hemodialysis for several decades. A new <b>distribution</b> <b>pipe</b> supplying water to a dialysis center on the island was installed in May 1996. To protect it from corrosion, this pipe was lined on the inside with a cement mortar. Because of the aggressiveness of the distilled water, calcium and aluminum (Al) leached from the cement mortar into the water used to prepare dialysate. This caused a possible hard water syndrome and definite acute Al intoxication. MethodsWe reviewed clinical details and outcome at follow-up, and arranged laboratory and toxicological studies of serum and hemodialysis water. ResultsOf the 27 patients who had a similar exposure (∼ 60 hours) to the contaminated dialysate, 10 died from acute Al encephalopathy, whereas 17 patients had no or only minor symptoms and survived. The nonsurvivors were older (64 ± 3 years vs. 52 ± 2 years, P 0. 05). Serum Al concentrations, available in seven nonsurvivors, {{were significantly higher than}} in the survivors (808 ± 127 vs. 255 ± 25 μg/L, P < 0. 01). ConclusionsThe water <b>distribution</b> <b>pipe</b> was lined with a cement mortar that was probably inappropriate for transporting drinking water. Water distribution facilities as well as the dialysis community {{should be aware of the}} possibility of Al leaching from cemented water distribution pipes.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} these two major topics. The first part id {{describing}} flowing through the <b>distribution</b> <b>pipe</b> during the pressure pulse. In the second one the most effective cleaning device configuration and venturi shape are selected. Finally the results of experiments were proofed in the field test. A criterion for uniform distribution of pressurized air along the <b>distribution</b> <b>pipe</b> resulting from condition of constant momentums of the airflow at the outlet from the <b>distribution</b> <b>pipe</b> has been derived. This criterion uses outlet nozzle cross-sections and static pressures in the pipe at the nozzles. Based on this criterion a relation which enables to design outlet nozzle diameters only from pipe and nominal nozzle diameter has been derived as well. The consumption of pressurized air as an important value for evaluation of the overall cleaning efficiency of the whole filter has been calculated for 1 pulse. Derived formula can be used easily in the field since the tank pressure is usually measured. A mathematical model describing air flow through the pipe has been set together. The model results from basic Bernoullis equation and equation of continuity. All necessary quantities (velocity, pressure, temperature and density) along the <b>distribution</b> <b>pipe</b> can be computed during the pressure pulse. Air flows through the outlet nozzles and pressurised air consumption can be calculated from these values. Very good agreement between calculated and experimentally measured values has been achieved. Twelve basic venturi shapes and six displacements between outlet nozzle and venturi were tested. For comparison of results an evaluation system was put together. The system is based on 6 criteria describing an efficient pressure pulse along the bag. The initial set of test was carried out without dust feeding. A gross selection was done. Followingly 4 selected venturis and 3 displacements were measured at conditions simulating a real operation, i. e. fan was in operation and dust was fed. Based on these tests the cleaning device configuration showing the most effective pulse was selected. The selected venturis were applied on the real fabric filter. The states {{before and after the}} retrofit were recorded. The pressurised air consumption, pressure drop and boiler steam production were calculated. The operational costs were evaluated for more objective comparison. Available from STL, Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|E

40|$|The {{applicability}} of Weibull statistics {{to the condition}} assessment of cast iron water <b>distribution</b> <b>pipes</b> has been considered. The effect of Weibull modulus, characteristic strength, sample size and mode of loading (tension or flexure) {{on the strength of}} cast iron water <b>distribution</b> <b>pipes</b> is investigated. The strength distribution of cast iron samples cut from sections of five different water <b>distribution</b> <b>pipes</b> recovered from the ground have been characterized. Strengths have been measured in flexure, at two different temperatures (ambient and 0 degrees C), and in tension at ambient temperature using two different sample sizes. It is shown that characteristic strength values in flexure decrease with increasing size of graphite flake and that there is {{no significant difference between the}} results at the two temperatures investigated. For samples of the same volume tested in tension and flexure, the reduced strength measured in tension is consistent with Weibull predictions. However, the strength of large samples tested in tension was not significantly different from the small samples, perhaps because the samples were of the same thickness and conventional Weibull scaling is not applicable. Finally, using a method which treats a large pipe as an assembly of small samples, the strength distributions from the small samples tested in tension are used to make a prediction of the strengths of 1 m span sections of pipe loaded in three-point bending, which were reported in previous work. The predicted pipe strengths are close to the lower end of the measured <b>pipe</b> strength <b>distribution.</b> Overall, this work suggests that Weibull analysis is a useful tool to examine the strength distribution of removed from cast iron water pipes and so has the potential to contribute in the assessment of asset condition...|$|R
