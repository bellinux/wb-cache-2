40|$|Deforestation {{rates in}} México are about 670, 000 ha/year. This threatens the {{richness}} of forest genetic resources in Méxi-co, causing the disappearance of locally adapted populations and rare and endangered pine species. México {{is one of the}} six megadiverse countries in the world, with half of the world’s Pinus species. Pinus {{is one of the most}} economically and eco-logically important forest genera in México. We suggest that delineation of seed zones and the establishment of a network of <b>Forest</b> <b>Genetic</b> <b>Resource</b> Conservation Units (FGRCUs), linked with forest management and ecological restoration programs will protect this valuable resource. We estimate that FGRCUs should include 25 to 50 ha each, with at least one FGRCU for each priority species in each seed zone. We highlight the need for studies of adaptive genetic variation among pine popula-tions and for new methodologies and techniques to suit ecologi-cal restoration under Mexican forest conditions. We briefly describe ongoing research on these topics on forests owned by a well-organized indigenous community in Nuevo San Jua...|$|E

The project provided the s ervices of consultants in park management, <b>forest</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>resource</b> conservation, and deer f armingA complete description of the Cuc Phuong National Park was prepared, as well as a document on national parks and protected areas planning; the latter was tr anslated into Vietnamese {{for the use of the}} Ministry of Forestry. The immediate creation of a n elementary protection service and of study groups for undertaking inventories of resources were recommended to strengthen national park management. In the long term, it would be necessary to develop a more permanent protection service, complete the resource inventory surveys, create the basic facilities in the parks, and prepare a programme for l ong-term park managementThe project also reviewed forest and vegetation cover in the region of Cuc Phuong, and advised on genetic resources conservation. For the protection of th ese resources, the basic requirements were training for patrol staff, and the prepar ation of management base maps. It was recommended that all species currently believed to be endemic should be included in the programme of ex situ conservation: a set of v oucher specimens of seed source trees should be deposited in the herbarium and special care should be taken to label seed from different sources, indicating precise parent treesThe potential for increasing deer farming in the area surrounding Cu c Phuong was high, particularly for small-scale industry in the abandoned fields to the s outh of the park. The project established a list of priority taxa for conservation, and it was recommended that Cuc Phuong National Park serve as an educational centre for local farmers, to promote interest in deer farming.

40|$|Following the Ministerial Conference for the Protection of Forest in Europe, held in Strasbourg in 1990, {{and more}} {{specifically}} its Resolution No. 2 concerning the conservation of <b>forest</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> EUFORGEN (European <b>Forest</b> <b>Genetic</b> <b>Resources</b> Programme) was established. EUFORGEN is a collaborative programme among European countries aimed at ensuring the effective conservation and the sustainable utilisation of <b>forest</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> in Europe. It is financed by participating countries (33 {{at the time of}} February 2004) and is co-ordinated by IPGRI (International Plant <b>Genetic</b> <b>Resources</b> Institute) in collaboration with the Forestry Department of FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations). The programme operates through networks in which forest geneticists and other forestry specialists work together to analyse needs, exchange experiences and develop conservation objectives and methods for selected species. Considerable efforts have been made to enhance conservation of <b>forest</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> and to promote sustainable forest management in Europe over the past decade. The need to enhance of genetic conservation emerged from a concern on the impacts of environmental pollution and <b>genetic</b> erosion on <b>forest</b> ecosystems in the late 1980 's. The concept of sustainable forest management, in a broader sense, gained ground in Europe after the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in 1992 paid special attention to the role of forest ecosystems in maintaining and conserving biological diversity.

In this editorial, we present some of the key findings of the SOW-FGR and introduce the seven reviews presented in this special edition on: (1) tree <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> and livelihoods; (2) the benefits and dangers of international germplasm transfers; (3) genetic indicators for monitoring threats to populations and the effectiveness of ameliorative actions; (4) the genetic impacts of timber management practices; (5) <b>genetic</b> considerations in <b>forest</b> ecosystem restoration projects using native trees; (6) genetic-level responses to climate change; and (7) ex situ conservation approaches and their integration with in situ methods.

40|$|A {{biobased}} economy implies sustainable {{and effective}} use of the biomass. This includes new products from forestry. The sustainable production, use, consumption and waste management of biomass all contribute to a bioeconomy (The European Bioeconomy in 2030).   In the context of bioeconomy the conservation of <b>forest</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> assumes a key significance in overcoming global challenges such as climate change. Forests are expected to {{play a key role}} in climate change mitigation, but they will only be able to fulfil that role if the trees themselves are able to survive and adapt to changing climate conditions. Genetic diversity provides the fundamental basis for the evolution of forest tree species and for their adaptation to change. The enormous range of goods and services provided by trees and forests is both a function of and testimony to the genetic variability contained within them.   Conserving forest  genetic  resources  is  therefore  vital, as  they  constitute  a  unique  and  irreplaceable resource for the future, including for sustainable economic growth and progress and environmental adaption (The State of the Worlds <b>Forest</b> <b>Genetic</b> <b>Resources</b> 2014). Previous research of population characteristics and the effects of natural and artificial selection on the genetic structure of populations contribute to the conservation and enhancement of the gene pool of the native tree species. The balance model of the population genetic structure reveals the new properties of the populations and requires further investigations, especially of the relations of subpopulations, half-sib families and organisms and the effect of variable factors of the environment, on the exchange of genetic material within natural and cultural populations. Being of national and international significance, these resources require intensive protection and enhancement in situ and ex situ. In this paper a general introduction is given to conservation of <b>forest</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> in Serbia, Croatia and Macedonia in the context of bio-economy.
