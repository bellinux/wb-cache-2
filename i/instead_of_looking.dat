Particularly in and around Calcutta, this period underwent what {{is now known as}} the Naxalite movement. This phase was immediately followed by a series of films where he shifted his focus, and <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> for enemies outside, he looked for the enemy within his own middle class society. This was arguably his most creative phase.|$|E

25|$|Of course, Lord King LC {{was worried}} that {{trustees}} might exploit opportunities to use trust property for themselves <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> after it. Business speculators using trusts had just recently caused a stock market crash. Strict duties for trustees {{made their way into}} company law and were applied to directors and chief executive officers. Another example of a trustee's duty might be to invest property wisely or sell it. This is especially the case for pension funds, the most important form of trust, where investors are trustees for people's savings until retirement. But trusts can also be set up for charitable purposes, famous examples being the British Museum or the Rockefeller Foundation.|$|E
25|$|Aurangzeb {{then broke}} his {{arrangement}} with Murad Baksh, which probably {{had been his}} intention all along. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> to partition the empire between himself and Murad, he had his brother arrested and imprisoned at Gwalior Fort. Murad was executed on 4 December 1661, ostensibly {{for the murder of}} the diwan of Gujarat some time earlier. The allegation was encouraged by Aurangzeb, who caused the diwan's son to seek retribution for the death under the principles of Sharia law. Meanwhile, Dara gathered his forces, and moved to the Punjab. The army sent against Shuja was trapped in the east, its generals Jai Singh and Dilir Khan submitted to Aurangzeb, but Dara's son, Suleiman Shikoh, escaped. Aurangzeb offered Shah Shuja the governorship of Bengal. This move had the effect of isolating Dara Shikoh and causing more troops to defect to Aurangzeb. Shah Shuja, who had declared himself emperor in Bengal began to annex more territory and this prompted Aurangzeb to march from Punjab with a new and large army that fought during the Battle of Khajwa, where Shah Shuja and his chain-mail armoured war elephants were routed by the forces loyal to Aurangzeb. Shah Shuja then fled to Arakan (in present-day Burma), where he was executed by the local rulers.|$|E
500|$|Although synth-pop in part {{arose from}} punk rock, it {{abandoned}} punk's emphasis on authenticity and often pursued a deliberate artificiality, {{drawing on the}} critically derided forms such as disco and glam rock. It owed relatively little to the foundations of early popular music in jazz, folk music or the blues, and <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> to America, in its early stages, it consciously focused on European and particularly Eastern European influences, which were reflected in band names like Spandau Ballet and songs like Ultravox's [...] "Vienna". Later synth-pop saw a shift to a style more influenced by other genres, such as soul music.|$|E

500|$|In October 1939, Chadwick {{received}} a letter from Sir Edward Appleton, the Secretary of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, asking for his opinion on the feasibility of an atomic bomb. Chadwick responded cautiously. He did not dismiss the possibility, but carefully went over the many theoretical and practical difficulties involved. Chadwick decided to investigate the properties of uranium oxide further with Rotblat. In March 1940, Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls at the University of Birmingham re-examined the theoretical issues involved in a paper that became known as the Frisch–Peierls memorandum. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> at uranium metal, they considered what would happen to a sphere of pure uranium-235, and found that not only could a chain reaction occur, but that it might require as little as [...] of uranium-235, and unleash the energy of tons of dynamite.|$|E
500|$|When screenwriter Rajat Aroraa {{initially}} started working, taking {{cues from}} producer Kapoor, {{the scope of}} the film was much smaller, primarily looking back to the soft-pornography scene of the 1980s. As work progressed, the scope gradually widened to include the controversial romances of Smitha through a fictionalised biopic. While researching for the film, director Luthria and screenwriter Aroraa found little material in magazines of that period, as [...] "women like Silk Smitha were often ignored by film magazines, except for gossip column mentions". Thus they derived many of the details of her life from anecdotes and party gossips, and then fictionalised them. Apart from depicting the pomp of the Telugu/Tamil film industry, the screenplay takes up issues such as money management by actors, [...] "their string of broken relationships", and the way they [...] "led lonely lives and met with tragic ends". For inspiration, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> at South Indian films of the period, the team turned to the work of mainstream Bollywood directors like Manmohan Desai, Vijay Anand, Raj Kapoor, Feroz Khan and G.P. Sippy. To put the global soft-porn industry in context, the team looked into Boogie Nights (1997) and The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996). The final script became a [...] "fictionalised, women-oriented, generalised perspective on the 1980s film industry".|$|E
500|$|By the 1980s new Keynesian economists became {{dissatisfied}} with these early nominal wage contract models since they predicted that real wages would be countercyclical (real wages would rise {{when the economy}} fell), while empirical evidence showed that real wages tended to be independent of economic cycles or even slightly procyclical. These contract models also did not make sense from a microeconomic standpoint since it was unclear why firms would use long-term contracts if they led to inefficiencies. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> for rigidities in the labor market, new Keynesians shifted {{their attention to the}} goods market and the sticky prices that resulted from [...] "menu cost" [...] models of price change. The term refers to the literal cost to a restaurant of printing new menus when it wants to change prices; however, economists also use it to refer to more general costs associated with changing prices, including the expense of evaluating whether to make the change. Since firms must spend money to change prices, they do not always adjust them to the point where markets clear, and this lack of price adjustments can explain why the economy may be in disequilibrium. Studies using data from the United States Consumer Price Index confirmed that prices do tend to be sticky. A good's price typically changes about every four to six months or, if sales are excluded, every eight to eleven months.|$|E

500|$|Greenwald {{first tried}} {{to take control of}} the sounds from the {{expensive}} synthesizers Guitar Center was selling by recording samples of them, but was unimpressed with the results. On a later visit to the shop, he recorded what would be the first sound to be featured on the album; he taped a guy who [...] "was just going for it on a drum kit", lowering the speed of the sample of the drum recording he used. The singer described how he felt while editing the sample: [...] "I started to hear some kind of solace in a place that is sonically hellish.” Greenwald started recording the album in a Guitar Center in Brooklyn, and then at a shop in Baltimore. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> to record instruments specifically planned for a song, Greenwald taped whatever sound he thought that could become better in quality when editing them later. Greenwald ended up with around 40 hours of iPhone recordings to work at his home. Some snippets were played through a 4-track tape recorder, others were old pedals and some were looped or used as synthesizer patches. These recordings were put together, EQ'd, mixed and mastered in Pro Tools. Much planning was put into how the recordings were edited together, as he tried to [...] "connect things that were seemingly un-connectable." [...] The end result was an album that featured ambient, dub, new-age, experimental and post-vaporwave styles.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{approach}} {{is made by}} the social bond or social control theory. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> for factors that make people become criminal, these theories try to explain why people do not become criminal.

[...] The more a person features those characteristics, the less likely (s)he is to become deviant (or criminal). [...] On the other hand, if these factors are not present, a person {{is more likely to}} become a criminal. Hirschi expanded on this theory with the idea that a person with low self control is more likely to become criminal.|$|E

2500|$|In {{one popular}} {{interpretation}} of stage theory, {{each of the}} so-called levels of existence envelops those below it: an ethical person is still capable of aesthetic enjoyment, for example, and a religious person is still capable of aesthetic enjoyment and ethical duty. The difference between these ways of living are internal, not external, and thus there are no external signs one can point to determine at what level a person is living. This inner and outer relationship is commonly determined by an individual by looking to others to gauge one's action, Kierkegaard believed one should look to oneself and in that relationship look to Christ as the example <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> at others because the more you look at others the less you see of yourself.

2500|$|He {{received}} three standing ovations {{from the}} record Metrodome crowd of 62,075, producing a Vikings win after four successive losses and 14 of the prior 18 matches with the Packers.

2500|$|Researchers {{believe that}} the {{difference}} in scores {{is closely related to}} the overall achievement gap in American society between students of different racial groups. This gap may be explainable in part by the fact that students of disadvantaged racial groups tend to go to schools that provide lower educational quality. This view is supported by evidence that the black-white gap is higher in cities and neighborhoods that are more racially segregated. It has also been suggested that stereotype threat has a significant effect on lowering achievement of minority students. For example, African Americans perform worse on a test when they are told that the test measures [...] "verbal reasoning ability", than when no mention of the test subject is made. [...] Other research cites poorer minority proficiency in key coursework relevant to the SAT (English and math), as well as peer pressure against students who try to focus on their schoolwork ("acting white"). Cultural issues are also evident among black students in wealthier households, with high achieving parents. [...] John Ogbu, a Nigerian-American professor of anthropology, found that <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> to their parents as role models, black youth chose other models like rappers and did not put forth the effort to be a good student.
