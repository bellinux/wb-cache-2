30|$|At pH 4, GLU {{sorption}} by {{electrostatic attraction}} (outer-sphere complexation) {{was assumed to}} prevail, accompanied by H bonding [17]. According to species distribution calculation, 78 % of GLU were dissociated, i.e. present as gluconate, and about 30 % of the surface sites were positively charged (≡S–OH 2 +). Due to the concomitant formation of <b>gluconolactones,</b> the proportion of charged GLU molecules might have been significantly smaller. At pH 7, the carboxylic group of GLU was almost completely dissociated (negatively charged), but the fraction of positively charged surface sites was diminished to about 1 % (corresponding to 1.2  mmol kg− 1) of the total sites. Consequently, the importance of electrostatic sorption was lower at pH 7 than at pH 4. However, at pH 7, gluconate ions might substitute uncharged surface sites via direct ligand exchange (inner-sphere surface complexation) or adsorb by polar interactions, e.g. hydrogen bonding. Due to the predominance of negative surface charges electrostatic attraction between GLU and the surface became less significant at alkaline pH. The monolayer adsorption capacity in the alkaline pH range might have been exceeded due to various processes. Firstly, surface erosion processes, initiated by hydroxide ions and GLU, might have led to an increase of the fractal surface dimension of the initially well-ordered synthetic mineral, thus {{increasing the number of}} surface sites. This hypothesis might be proven by various advanced microscopic techniques, including confocal laser scanning microscopy, electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. An increase of the surface porosity might be detectable by N 2 adsorption. Secondly, coordinating Al 3 + ions might have (partially) compensated the negative charge of solved gluconate ions allowing for adsorption of the formed species. Thirdly, surface precipitation of polynuclear Al complexes, formed during gibbsite hydrolysis, might have enlarged the sorption capacity additionally [37].|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} a “critical oxygen concentration” is {{conventionally}} considered to hold for the submerged aerobic fermentation of glucose to gluconic acid. Above the critical level the fermentation rate is supposedly independent of oxygen concentration. In this work it is shown that, at a given agitation rate, the fermentation is independent of dissolved oxygen when above the critical. However, {{an increase in the}} agitation rate results in an increase in the fermentation rate. This increase was shown to be accompanied by an increase in the <b>gluconolactone</b> concentration in the broth. <b>Gluconolactone,</b> an intermediate in the reaction pathway, is hydrolyzed nonenzymatically to gluconic acid. Evidence is presented to suggest that the increased gas-liquid interfacial area brought about by increased agitation causes an increased net rate of lactone formation. This in turn results in an increased rate of hydrolysis of the lactone to gluconic acid. A model is presented hypothesizing that negatively charged cells adsorb at the gas-liquid interface. These cells attract hydrogen ions, causing a lowering of the pH in the film around the bubbles. It is this lowered pH which is considered to bring about increased fermentation rates when the interfacial area is increased. Supporting evidence is presented...|$|E
