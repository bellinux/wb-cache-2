25|$|Bas started {{training}} boxing in {{the backyard}} of an elementary school with a friend. Rutten became interested in martial arts at age 12 after his family went on vacation to France, where the movie Enter the Dragon starring Bruce Lee was playing at a local movie theatre. Bas could not get in because the movie was rated 17+, so {{he and his brother}} Sjoerd snuck into the theatre. After he saw the movie, he took an interest in martial arts. At first, his conservative parents didn't allow him to pursue, but after two years of begging his parents, at age 14, they allowed him to practice taekwondo. <b>He</b> <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> up very quickly and after a few months he got in a street fight with the biggest bully in town. Rutten, now more confident, took the challenge and broke the bully's nose and KO'd him with the first punch he threw. The police showed up at his parent's place, and Rutten was immediately prohibited by his parents from further practicing martial arts.|$|E
25|$|His term as rector was brief, though, for on June 9, 1982, he was {{appointed}} coadjutor bishop to the then controversial and prophetic Bishop Francisco Claver, of Diocese of Malaybalay, Bukidnon. In this moment of difficulty, Rosales recalled that a stampita (holy picture) dropped from his breviary (liturgy of the hours). It was from Mother (now Blessed) Teresa of Calcutta. When <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> up, he saw the writing at the back. It read: “Allow God to use you without first consulting you.” These words brought peace to his soul. On September 14, 1984, Rosales succeeded the Bishop of Malaybalay taking complete authority over the diocese. He started his ministry in Malaybalay by forming with his people, especially the priest and religious there, {{a vision of the}} diocese: that of the total development of every person and all persons, brought about by Jesus Christ. In that difficult assignment, he was able to bring about the unity of the clergy as they struggled especially for justice, peace and environmental protection. He often looks back to his days there as the golden moments of his ministry.|$|E
25|$|The Bears got {{the early}} leap on the Sooners. Running back Brandon Whitaker {{scored on a}} 46yard {{touchdown}} run halfway through the first quarter to put the Bears up 7–0. The Sooners responded on their next possession. The Sooners started on their own 28yard line and capped the drive off with a 25yard touchdown run from DeMarco Murray. Baylor went three and out on their next possession and gave the ball back to Oklahoma on the Oklahoma 49yard line. The Sooners only needed one play to score again and that came on a 51yard touchdown pass from Sam Bradford to Malcolm Kelly. On their next drive, Baylor drove to Oklahoma's 21yard line, was forced {{to settle for a}} field goal, then missed. On the next possession, Bradford connected with tight end Jermaine Gresham for a 43yard pass that set up a oneyard touchdown run for Murray. Late in the 2nd quarter, Baylor quarterback Blake Szymanski threw a 75yard touchdown pass to Thomas White to bring the score to 21–14. On the ensuing kickoff, returner Murray let the ball roll past him before <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> up near the 10yard line. He managed to shed tacklers and get to the outside and to return the kickoff 91yards for a touchdown and bring the score to 28–14 before going into halftime.|$|E

25|$|Hook goes {{calling for}} Emma and {{stands on a}} rooftop to get attention. He jumps off, and Emma uses magic to take him safely to the ground, before asking {{why he was so}} sure she’d save him. He says he was optimistic, and then asks what {{happened}} between them in Camelot. He says he forgives her, but she says that she's the Dark One and forgiveness. Hook says there’s nothing she’s done could be as bad as what he’s done. He shows her a ring that belonged to Barnaby, and whom he killed front of his wife. He says that every ring he wears is a sad story. She shows him the ring he gave her to keep safe, and he says it was the saddest story of all; it belonged to a man better than him, his brother Liam. She tries to give it back but he tells her to keep it. He says he wore rings as trophies and now they’re just reminders. When Emma asks if Hook wants to know the truth, no matter how terrible, Hook says he loves her no matter what, and Emma says she needs to show him something. She takes him to her house and she points him to a telescope. He looks and sees the sea and a full moon over the waves. She says he told her the ocean calmed him and he says it’s a nice home she picked, but Emma says that <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>it,</b> not her. He looks at the newspaper and recognized his handwriting on it. She says he told her this was their future and she says everything she did was to keep that future alive. He asks again for the truth and she says they’re almost there and kisses him. She says she can’t tell him everything because he would try and stop her. After the kiss, Hook gets groggy and asks what she's doing, before passing out.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, the {{adaptive}} optics {{team at the}} Keck telescopes in Hawaii carried out observations of the four brightest TNOs (Pluto, , , and Eris), using the newly commissioned laser guide star adaptive optics system. Images taken on September 10 revealed a moon in orbit around Eris. In keeping with the [...] "Xena" [...] nickname already in use for Eris, Brown's team nicknamed the moon [...] "Gabrielle", after the television warrior princess' sidekick. When Eris received its official name from the IAU, the moon received the name Dysnomia, after the Greek goddess of lawlessness who was Eris's daughter. Brown says <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> for similarity to his wife's name, Diane. The name also retains an oblique reference to Eris's old informal name Xena, portrayed on TV by Lucy Lawless.|$|E
500|$|Seydlitz's {{first months}} as a cornet were made {{difficult}} by the regimental colonel, who considered him a spy for the Margrave, and abused him by sending him on useless errands and generally {{making it clear}} that the cornet was no match for the colonel. Within a year of Seydlitz's commission, the old King Frederick William died and his son, Frederick II of Prussia, ascended to the throne. [...] Frederick claimed Silesia from the Habsburg's Maria Theresa, and made a broad appeal to arms. [...] The Margrave's regiment {{played an important role in}} the ensuing war, during which Seydlitz came to the notice of the King several times. Once, when Frederick asked the caliber of the artillery shelling the Prussian line, opinions were divided and vague. Seydlitz rode in front of the battery, halting in their line of fire. When he saw a ball hit the ground, <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> up, wrapped it in his handkerchief and presented it to the King.|$|E

60|$|CHARTERIS (running anxiously to the book). Don't damage property, Julia. (<b>He</b> <b>picks</b> <b>it</b> up and dusts it.) Making scenes is {{an affair}} of sentiment: {{damaging}} property is serious. (Replaces {{it on the}} table.) And now do pray come along.|$|R
2500|$|A {{more serious}} {{objection}} concerns the film's [...] "timeline". This {{is important because}} Kodachrome II movie film, as far as is known, could only be developed by a lab containing a $60,000+ machine, and the few West Coast labs known to possess one did not do developing over weekends. Patterson's brother-in-law Al DeAtley claims not to remember where he took the film for development—or even where <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> up.|$|E
2500|$|Croll {{chose to}} skip the Preakness Stakes on May 21 and instead entered Holy Bull in the prestigious Metropolitan Handicap, popularly known as the Met Mile, against older horses on May 30. The field {{included}} the 1993 Belmont Stakes winner Colonial Affair, multiple stakes winner Devil His Due and the fast improving Cherokee Run, who {{would go on to}} be named the champion sprinter of 1994. In one of his best performances, Holy Bull quickly took the lead and drew off to win by [...] lengths, earning a Beyer Speed Figure of 122. [...] "I still can't explain the Derby," [...] said Smith. [...] "But today he came out and showed what he is, like he always does [...] – except for the first Saturday in May. He broke well and, every time I asked him to pick it up, <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Limestone Lad was {{scheduled}} to be offered for sale as a three-year-old gelding at Tattersalls Ireland in June 1995, but was withdrawn from the auction after the auctioneer's vet found that he had an abnormal heartbeat. The gelding was officially trained throughout his racing career by James Bowe, although the day-to-day handling was managed by his son Michael on the family farm which was also home to 60 cattle and 150 sheep. Commenting on the process of training the horse Michael Bowe said [...] "Everything you taught him, you had to do it slowly and carefully - but once <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> up he would die or do it. He was so genuine, all {{he wanted to do was}} to please you". [...] He was often subjected to demanding schedules, with few breaks: Bowe explained the strategy by saying [...] "He is happiest racing frequently and the more you take him racing the more he likes it".|$|E

Vortech's laughter is heard as the scene fades out, suggesting that the figure {{has been transformed into}} another Vortech.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the night}} of October 2, 1952, Kelso was serving at a vital outpost near Sokchon, Korea, when a numerically {{superior}} enemy attack, under cover of small arms, grenade and mortar fire, made casualties of both his platoon commander and platoon sergeant. After exposing himself to a hail of enemy fire to try to reorganize the unit, he was driven to cover with four other Marines in a nearby bunker, where an enemy grenade landed among them. <b>He</b> <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> up, ran into the open and threw it back at the enemy, receiving painful wounds as the grenade exploded on leaving his hand. He was again forced into the shelter by even more intense enemy fire, but refused to remain there. Moving out into the fire-swept area, he fired away at the enemy until he was mortally wounded, thereby covering the escape of the other Marines from the bunker. For his [...] "conspicuous gallantry" [...] in this final action, {{he was awarded the}} Medal of Honor. He was also posthumously awarded two Purple Heart Medals.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the next}} few years Iwata {{composed}} music for titles from a number of different companies, including Quest. On several of these titles he was credited by the nickname REZON. The nickname comes from the name of the car the hero drove in a show he watched as a child, and <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> up as he liked the sound of it. Iwata's first encounter with mainstream success in Japan came about in 1993 when he composed [...] along with Sakimoto. The soundtrack included a wide variety of instrumentation in its orchestral score, which was new to the composers who chose some instruments from a musical instrument description book Iwata had found. This collaboration led to Iwata co-composing several titles with Sakimoto over {{the next few}} years, culminating with his first brush with international success with Final Fantasy Tactics in 1997. On these collaborations, the two typically divided up the work and worked on their own tracks, rather than co-compose each piece. Iwata also collaborated with several other artists during this period in his career, including Toshiaki Sakoda and Masanobu Tsukamoto.|$|E
2500|$|After graduation, Buchanan {{became a}} {{principal}} {{at a public}} high school, in the Houghton school in Detroit. In 1870, she moved to Chicago {{to pursue a career}} in journalism. Her reception by the Chicago editors was anything but favorable. Her youth and sex, they told her frankly, were against her. It was some time, therefore, before she received a position on any of the Chicago dailies. During the time when she was without regular work, she wrote continuously, sending her stories to the various papers. Her manuscripts, as a rule, were accepted but the acceptances brought her no staff position. The editors refused consistently to take a woman on their papers. The first story which she had accepted was an account of the reception at Sacred Heart Convent, where she boarded during her first years in Chicago. She took the story to the offices of the Chicago Times and laid it on the desk of the managing editor. <b>He</b> <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> up, glanced at it and gave Sullivan US$5. A few days later, as she was walking down Madison Avenue, some one tapped her on the shoulder. It was the editor of the Times. “I am sorry, Miss Buchanan, that I did not read your article before I paid you. It was extremely well written and worth more than five dollars.” At that, he handed her a $10 bill. Margaret Buchanan was 20 {{years old at the time}} and bore a striking resemblance to Rosa Bonheur.|$|E

While walking home, the man encounters a white ball which has rolled from a dark alley. <b>He</b> <b>picks</b> <b>it</b> up and walks into the alley where a voice asks him to return the ball. He walks into the darkness, disappears, and the ball is bounced outside again.|$|R
50|$|Harry {{breaks into}} Dr Stirling's house and discovers a {{photograph}} of his wife. <b>He</b> <b>picks</b> <b>it</b> up, knocking over a vase, the sound of which attracts Stirling's servant.

This shot is head by a policeman who runs {{to the house and}} captures Selby, who is eventually sentenced to death.|$|R

60|$|Of {{the five}} who are wholly right, I think BRADSHAW OF THE FUTURE, CAIUS, CLIFTON C., and MARTREB deserve special praise for their full {{analytical}} solutions. MATTHEW MATTICKS picks out No. 9, and proves {{it to be}} the right house in two ways, very neatly and ingeniously, but why <b>he</b> <b>picks</b> <b>it</b> out does not appear. It is an excellent synthetical proof, but lacks the analysis which the other four supply.|$|R
60|$|Thornton {{stood between}} him and Buck, and evinced no {{intention}} {{of getting out of}} the way. Hal drew his long hunting-knife. Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria. Thornton rapped Hal's knuckles with the axe-handle, knocking the knife to the ground. He rapped his knuckles again as <b>he</b> tried to <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> up. Then <b>he</b> stooped, <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> up himself, and with two strokes cut Buck's traces.|$|R
