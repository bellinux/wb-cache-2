5|$|The game {{begins in}} the Arizona Territory in 1876 with Jericho {{attempting}} to rob a Darkwatch train that is transporting the captured Lazarus Malkoth to the Darkwatch Citadel, a frequently mentioned and often visited location in the game. His actions inadvertently release Lazarus into the West. In a seeming bit of mercy, Lazarus bites Jericho and gives him {{the curse of the}} vampire, causing him to slowly turn into one. The game continues with the introduction of Darkwatch agent Cassidy Sharp as well as the appearance of Shadow, Jericho's undead horse whom <b>he</b> <b>fed</b> on and turned in a frenzy after being bitten by Lazarus.|$|E
5|$|These were {{years of}} tension in policy towards France, with Walsingham sceptical of the {{unpredictable}} Henry III and distrustful of the English ambassador in Paris, Edward Stafford. Stafford, who was compromised by his gambling debts, {{was in the}} pay of the Spanish and passed vital information to Spain. Walsingham may {{have been aware of}} Stafford's duplicity, as <b>he</b> <b>fed</b> the ambassador false information, presumably in the hope of fooling or confusing the Spanish.|$|E

5|$|A {{motif of}} father-against-son {{conflict}} was repeated when Cronus {{was confronted by}} his son, Zeus. Because Cronus had betrayed his father, he feared that his offspring would do the same, and so each time Rhea gave birth, he snatched up the child and ate it. Rhea hated this and tricked him by hiding Zeus and wrapping a stone in a baby's blanket, which Cronus ate. When Zeus was full grown, <b>he</b> <b>fed</b> Cronus a drugged drink which caused him to vomit, throwing up Rhea's other children and the stone, which {{had been sitting in}} Cronus's stomach all along. Zeus then challenged Cronus to war for the kingship of the gods. At last, {{with the help of the}} Cyclopes (whom Zeus freed from Tartarus), Zeus and his siblings were victorious, while Cronus and the Titans were hurled down to imprisonment in Tartarus.|$|E

In the meantime, Principal Seymour Skinner and Edna Krabappel attend and have a conversation which leads to them discovering that they have romantic feelings for each other. They end up kissing in Martin's pink playhouse in an act witnessed by Bart Simpson, who did not get sick since <b>he</b> <b>fed</b> his oysters to Martin's cat, along with Lisa who feigns sickness so she could leave without excuse.|$|E
5|$|Yazid-ibn-Mohalleb, {{a general}} under the Umayyads, was {{appointed}} {{the head of}} a great army to lead the Mazandaran expedition. On the way to Mazandaran, the general ordered captives to be hanged at {{the two sides of the}} road so that the victorious Arab army pass through. The attack on Tabarestan (present-day Mazandaran) failed, but he established his control in Gorgan. By the orders of Yazid-ibn-Mohalleb so many Persians were beheaded in Gorgan that their blood mixed with water would energize the millstone to produce as much as one day meal for him, as he had vowed. Extent of his brutality represented itself by running watermills by people's blood for three days and <b>he</b> <b>fed</b> his army with the bread made from that very bloody flour. But, Tabarestan remained invincible until the majority of Zoroastrians migrated towards India and the rest converted to Islam gradually.|$|E

25|$|While Strom {{earned more}} than twice as much in the ABA than the NBA, he soon became disenchanted with the ABA for the lack of big name superstars and arenas that the NBA provided. Strom had {{anticipated}} that the ABA product would be inferior to the NBA, but assumed that the increase in pay would compensate for the level of play. However, <b>he</b> <b>fed</b> off the energy of the fans when officiating games and the small attendance sizes in the ABA made him feel depressed.|$|E
25|$|Detroit {{gained a}} huge boost in game five, as star two-way player Pavel Datsyuk {{played for the}} first time in the series after {{returning}} from a foot injury. The Penguins were the team that began the match with energy, dominating the first five minutes, and producing a variety of chances from the Evgeni Malkin-Ruslan Fedotenko-Max Talbot line. However, the Red Wings rallied around a rejuvenated Datsyuk to take over the game midway through the period. Datsuyk's skating allowed Detroit to score at 13:32 of the period, as <b>he</b> <b>fed</b> a pass to Dan Cleary during a three-on-three transition play. Cleary used Penguins' defenceman Brooks Orpik as a screen as he shot the puck past goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury. The Penguins began to unravel in the second period, committing five minor penalties in the frame. This undisciplined hockey allowed Detroit to score three power play goals and one marker that occurred seconds after a penalty had expired.|$|E

5000|$|In The Simpsons episode [...] "Four Great Women and a Manicure", Homer embodies Macbeth, a {{reluctant}} husband who follows Marge's commands to kill Sideshow Mel and assumes Macbeth's role. However, his performance receives unfavorable reviews {{compared to the}} more seasoned actors and even those with no lines. So with more reluctance, Homer kills off the other actors until he's the only one left. Even after performing well, <b>he's</b> <b>fed</b> up with Marge's attempts to make him audition for more Shakespearean plays and kills himself so he doesn't need to audition anymore.|$|R
500|$|One {{way to see}} if we are {{practicing}} right livelihood is to compare our trade with that of Jabba the Hutt.

He also transacts business in the slave trade. He has many slaves himself, and some <b>he</b> <b>fed</b> to the Rancor, a creature he kept caged and tormented in his dungeon. Jabba uses deception and violence to maintain his position.|$|E
500|$|Desbouvrie {{kept his}} {{swallows}} {{in a cage}} and trained them to fly {{in and out of}} the cage. [...] Another challenge he overcame was the birds' natural migratory behavior. [...] Desbouvrie believed that swallows migrated southward because the supply of insects for them to feed upon dwindled in winter. [...] Desbouvrie refused to make public disclosure of what <b>he</b> <b>fed</b> the birds in wintertime and regarded that as a trade secret. [...] Later attempts to train homing behavior into migratory birds determined that the birds have no instinctive knowledge of where to fly when the season changes, so if the normal migratory pattern is disrupted during the first year of life the individual does not migrate afterward.|$|E
500|$|For the 1909 Varsity Match, Cunningham {{announced}} {{his choice of}} Poulton at a meeting on 2 December which Vassall was unable to attend. Cunningham sent him a letter by hand informing him of the decision. When the note returned undelivered, Cunningham hesitated, at which point Tarr offered {{to give up his}} own place for Poulton but Cunningham stuck to his initial selection. The game was played on 11 December, with Oxford at the start having the worse of it until one moment turned the game around: after the Oxford forwards got the ball back, Gotley, at scrum-half, sent the ball to Cunningham, who passed on to Tarr and he to his fellow centre Colin Gilray. <b>He</b> <b>fed</b> the ball to Poulton on the left wing still inside the Oxford half. Poulton then broke through the defence to score under the posts. With Oxford eight points ahead {{at the end of the}} first quarter, Tarr was forced off the field after breaking his collarbone making a tackle, and missed much of what was described by referee F.C. Potter-Irwin as [...] "the fastest and most spectacular Varsity Match he had ever witnessed". Oxford beat Cambridge 23–3, Poulton scoring five tries.|$|E

500|$|Thierry Henry {{paid tribute}} to Larsson's {{contribution}} to Barcelona's win after the game, saying, [...] "People always talk about Ronaldinho, Eto'o, Giuly and everything, but I didn't see them today, I saw Henrik Larsson. He came on, he changed the game, that is what killed the game. Sometimes you talk about Ronaldinho and Eto'o and people like that; {{you need to talk}} about the proper footballer who made the difference, and that was Henrik Larsson tonight." [...] Henry also remarked, [...] "You have to remember that Barcelona is a team. It's not Eto'o, it's not Ronaldinho. On Wednesday, the man who made the difference was Henrik Larsson. You have to give him credit for that because when he came on he made some amazing runs around the box and he showed he is a team player. You saw two times <b>he</b> <b>fed</b> the ball back to people and that's what I always talk about, he is a team player. He did that against us, even though the first goal was a close offside decision." [...] Larsson's addition giving Barcelona the cutting edge required to overcome Arsenal was noted by international press.|$|E
500|$|During {{the late}} 18th and early 19th centuries, {{the use of}} {{deprivation}} studies allowed scientists to isolate and identify a number of vitamins. Lipid from fish oil was used to cure rickets in rats, and the fat-soluble nutrient was called [...] "antirachitic A". Thus, the first [...] "vitamin" [...] bioactivity ever isolated, which cured rickets, was initially called [...] "vitamin A"; however, the bioactivity of this compound is now called vitamin D. In 1881, Russian surgeon Nikolai Lunin studied the effects of scurvy at the University of Tartu in present-day Estonia. <b>He</b> <b>fed</b> mice an artificial mixture of all the separate constituents of milk known at that time, namely the proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and salts. The mice that received only the individual constituents died, while the mice fed by milk itself developed normally. He made a conclusion that [...] "a natural food such as milk must therefore contain, besides these known principal ingredients, small quantities of unknown substances essential to life." [...] However, his conclusions were rejected by his advisor, Gustav von Bunge, even after other students reproduced his results. A similar result by Cornelius Pekelharing appeared in a Dutch medical journal [...] in 1905, {{but it was not}} widely reported.|$|E
