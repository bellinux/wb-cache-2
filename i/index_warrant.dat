40|$|Background: The {{progression}} of obstructive airway diseases (OADs) including asthma, {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) and asthma-COPD overlap syndrome in older adults {{is not well}} understood. Objective: To examine the prognosis of OADs and to identify potential determinants for longitudinal changes in clinical outcomes. Methods: We consecutively recruited 99 older adults (> 55 years) with OADs who underwent a multidimensional assessment at baseline and 4 years which involved spirometry, 6 -min walk distance (6 MWD), assessments of health status (Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire, SGRQ), comorbidity, and serum and sputum biomarkers. All-cause mortality and respiratory hospitalisation during the follow-up period were recorded. Clinical outcomes were compared between basal and final visits, and changes in clinical outcomes were compared among asthma, COPD and asthma-COPD overlap groups. Associations between clinical parameters, biomarkers and prognosis were examined. Results: After a median follow-up of 4. 2 years, outcome data were available for 75 (75. 8 %) patients. There were 16 (16. 2 %) deaths. The BODE index predicted all-cause mortality in older people with OADs. While spirometry, 6 MWD and SGRQ deteriorated significantly over the 4 years, there was significant heterogeneity in the longitudinal changes in these clinical outcomes. Participants with COPD had a significant decline in FEV 1 (p = 0. 003), SGRQ (p = 0. 030) and 6 MWD [decline of 75. 5 (93. 4) m, p = 0. 024]. The change in 6 MWD was lower in the asthma-COPD overlap group. Airflow reversibility was associated with a reduced decline in 6 MWD. Conclusion: COPD patients had a poor prognosis compared with asthma and asthma-COPD overlap patients. The BODE index is a useful prognostic indicator in older adults with OADs.

The capacity of such crops {{to meet the requirements}} of young livestock and reproducing animals for sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca) and potassium (K) is reviewed. The growth responses of young stock to Na and/or Mg supplements when grazing wheat are discussed. These responses differ from 'literature expectation' in that they are rapid in onset and involve no clinical signs. We demonstrate that more insight about the variability in supplement response, both between and between crops species, is obtained when mineral contents are viewed from the perspective of their frequency distributions, rather than their mean values. The pivotal importance of high K concentration, low Na and the resultant K:Na ratio of forage is stressed, as is the interaction of these minerals in relation to Mg absorption. We also present frequency distributions for a range of mineral indices that 'capture' mineral interactions, including the 'tetany index', forage K: (Na+Mg) ratio and dietary cation-anion difference. It is concluded that the last two <b>indices</b> <b>warrant</b> a much closer investigation. Possible effects of forage aluminium and organic acid contents are briefly discussed; these also deserve closer examination.

40|$|Background: Epithelial {{maturation}} traditionally is used {{to grade}} CIN in histologic sections. However, in some an immature epithelium displays atypia that is low {{in proportion to the}} level of epithelial maturity. Although MIB 1 and p 16 ink 4 are helpul in establishing the diagnosis of CIN in this setting, classifying such lesions can be problematic. We analyzed a subset of these atypias, and this study summarizes a correlation between morphology and p 16 and MIB 1 immunostaining. Design: Immature metaplastic atypias were divided into those with putative low (uniform nuclear spacing, minimal nuclear variation, absent or mild nuclear hyperchromasia) and high-grade (irregular nuclear spacing, heterogeneous nuclear morphology, increased nuclear chromasia) features. Immunohistochemical staining for p 16 was classiﬁ ed as patchy or diffuse (horizontally) and MIB- 1 proliferation index was recorded as percentage of positive cells and location of elevated proliferative index as a function of basal, middle and superﬁ cial third of the epithelium. Staining patterns and histologic grade were correlated. Results: Forty-three cases were classified without knowledge of the immunohistochemistry. Immature metaplastic low grade CINs exhibited strong and diffuse staining for p 16 and but unlike High grade CINs, the proliferating (MIB 1 +) cells were concentrated in the more basal 1 - 2 thirds of the epithelium and the proliferative index was less than 30 %. Variable columnar differentiation was observed in some, with strong staining of both the columnar and squamous cells by p 16. Conclusions: A distinct subset of immature CINs displays a uniform cell population and based on both cytology and proliferative <b>index,</b> <b>warrants</b> classiﬁ cation as low grade CIN (CIN 1). p 16 immunohistochemistry, although helpful in the recognition of these lesions, will not distinguish them from higher grade CIN (CIN 2 / 3). Attention to regularity in nuclear morphology with absence of noticeable differences in cell size and shape, combined with MIB 1 staining, is helpful,. The presence of columnar differentiation, which also stains positive for p 16 is consistent with bidirectional differentiation in the transformation zone epithelium.

30|$|Currently, a post-exercise {{reduction}} in DHEA-S {{has been a}} consistent finding in studies using high-volume exercise protocols [mixed-type and resistance based (Chen et al. 2011; Tsai et al. 2006)]. In weightlifters who demonstrated a post-exercise strength-decay and DHEA-S reduction, an increase in DHEA-S towards baseline during recovery was associated with improved strength-performance (Chen et al. 2011). The observed {{reduction in}} DHEA-S in response to exercise is believed to represent physiological consumption which promotes recovery (Gudemez et al. 2002; Lee et al. 2006). However, no study examining the DHEA-S response to resistance-exercise has measured DHEA-S levels within 3  h of exercise cessation. The induced elevation of baseline DHEA-S (through supplementation) {{has been reported to}} improve exercise-induced delayed onset of muscle-soreness (DOMS) (Liao et al. 2012). Additionally, DHEA-S levels have been linked to mood-state adjustment in elite golfers post major competition (Wang et al. 2009). Collectively these findings suggest that DHEA-S may have a broad role in recovery processes. Since elite-competition environments produce strong emotional alterations in athletes (Lane et al. 2007; Terry and Lane 2000) which could compromise the researcher’s control of variables, further research combining DHEA-S and mood <b>indices</b> are <b>warranted</b> in a controlled scientific environment.|$|R
40|$|Background: Why {{are some}} people happier than others? This {{question}} has intrigued many researchers. However, limited work has addressed this question within a neuroscientific framework. Methods: The present study investigated the neural correlates of trait happiness using the resting-state {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (rs-fMRI) approach. Specifically, regional homogeneity (ReHo) was examined on two groups of young adults: happy and unhappy individuals (N = 25 per group).

Background:	A disproportionate number of departmental and faculty productivity indices in higher education rely solely on research. Productivity in other areas of faculty workload areas, like teaching and institutional and community service, are either measured separately or ignored all together – even when those activities are institutionally mandated. This does a disservice to those who work in those institutions and skews incentives. Methodology: This paper utilizes a unified methodology inclusive of the three primary areas of faculty responsibility (teaching, research, and service) to calculate depart-mental productivity in five disparate departments (English, Biology, Mathematics, Sociology, and Computer Science) common to two universities with differing missions (teaching and service). Findings: The results reveal the bias inherent in relying solely on research as a proxy for overall productivity in institutions that have differing missions. Recommendations for Practitioners: Utilizing better metrics informs higher education administrators, promotes better decision-making, and allows incentives to re-align with desired outcomes.

40|$|Most solid tumors, {{including}} pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), exhibit {{structural and}} numerical chromosome instability (CIN). Although often implicated {{as a driver}} of tumor progression and drug resistance, CIN also reduces cell fitness and poses a vulnerability that can be exploited therapeutically. The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) ensures correct chromosome-microtubule attachment, thereby minimizing chromosome segregation errors. Many tumors exhibit upregulation of SAC components such as MPS 1, which may help contain CIN within survivable limits. Prior studies showed that MPS 1 inhibition with the small molecule NMS-P 715 limits tumor growth in xenograft models. In cancer cell lines, NMS-P 715 causes cell death associated with impaired SAC function and increased chromosome missegregation. Although normal cells appeared more resistant, effects on stem cells, which are the dose-limiting toxicity of most chemotherapeutics, were not examined. Elevated expression of 70 genes (CIN 70), including MPS 1, provides a surrogate measure of CIN and predicts poor patient survival in multiple tumor types. Our new findings show {{that the degree of}} CIN 70 upregulation varies considerably among PDAC tumors, with higher CIN 70 gene expression predictive of poor outcome. We identified a 25 gene subset (PDAC CIN 25) whose overexpression was most strongly correlated with poor survival and included MPS 1. In vitro, growth of human and murine PDAC cells is inhibited by NMS-P 715 treatment, whereas adipose-derived human mesenchymal stem cells are relatively resistant and maintain chromosome stability upon exposure to NMS-P 715.

40|$|Abstract—The TreeSAAP {{software}} {{has been}} successfully used {{in a variety of}} protein studies for identifying and characterizing adaptation in terms of shifts in the physicochemical properties of amino acid replacements. It differentiates adaptive replacements from those that may have resulted from random mutation. The accuracy of TreeSAAP was tested using simulated protein–coding DNA data that was randomly generated using a bifurcating phylogeny to reflect a random pattern of mutation constrained only by the structure of the genetic code. A sampling of 1402 simulated amino acid replacements resulted in a default accuracy of 80. 6 %. More than 50 % of the false–positive results were traced to just 11 of the possible single–step amino acid exchanges, each of which exhibited less than 50 % accuracy. When these 11 exchanges are eliminated from the subsequent analysis, the accuracy of TreeSAAP is increased to nearly 90 %. Further testing of this modified approach for adverse implications with empirical data is <b>warranted.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Simulated protein–coding DNA sequences, TreeSAAP, analytical results, accuracy.

40|$|Glottal closed phase {{estimation}} during speech {{production is}} critical to inverse filtering and, although addressed for radiated acoustic pressure analysis, must be better understood {{for the analysis of}} the oral airflow volume velocity signal that provides important properties of healthy and disordered voices. This paper compares the estimation of the closed phase from the acoustic speech signal and the oral airflow waveform recorded using a pneumotachograph mask. Results are presented for ten adult speakers with normal voices who sustained a set of vowels at a comfortable pitch and loudness. With electroglottography as reference, the identification rate and accuracy of glottal closure instants for the oral airflow are 96. 8 % and 0. 28 ms, whereas these metrics are 99. 4 % and 0. 10 ms for the acoustic signal. We conclude that glottal closure detection is adequate for close phase inverse filtering but that improvements to detection of glottal opening instants on the oral airflow signal are <b>warranted.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Inverse filtering, glottal airflow, Rothenberg mask, glottal closure instant detection 1...|$|R
30|$|This study {{utilized}} the ΔNBR index to classify Landsat imagery to four levels of burn severity to assess two large wildfires {{that occurred in}} the Juniper Prairie Wilderness of the Ocala National Forest, Florida, USA. We reported an application of the ΔNBR and CBI indices in a region and ecosystem that has had comparably few studies of remote sensing mapping techniques. Using field plots to test agreement, it was determined that the ΔNBR burn severity index provided a suitable means of classifying Landsat imagery for the assessment of burn severity in sand pine scrub. Field plots using visual assessments of burn severity along with CBI measurements were positively correlated with ΔNBR index values (0.70 and 0.72) and had moderate overall accuracy (48.3 % and 50 %, respectively). This suggests that further use and assessment of the ΔNBR <b>index</b> is <b>warranted</b> for burn severity mapping applications and fire ecology studies in upland southeastern US ecosystems. Contrary to the notion that sand pine scrub always burns at high severity, burn severity differed between the two fires and among the forest types and stand types. Burn severity directional analysis at the pixel level found that high severity fire was typically followed by low severity fire in the sand pine stands, while low to moderate severity fire was followed by low to moderate severity fire in the longleaf and slash pine stands. These results suggest that forest stand type and age, as well as burn severity history, influence future fire effects on vegetation in sand pine scrub, even under severe fire weather and drought conditions. Further research is needed to understand the influence of fire severity thresholds on the perpetuation of the sand pine scrub ecosystem, as area managers seek to maintain ecosystems despite changing climate patterns that may increase the frequency of fire occurrence and influence post-burn vegetative responses.|$|R
40|$|The wide {{spectrum}} of clinical manifestations and high relapse rate represent a therapeutic challenge in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Observational studies suggested efficacy of rituximab (RTX), a B-cell-targeting antibody, to control the activity of SLE. Two randomized trials controlled by placebo did not prove the superiority of RTX when used in addition to conventional treatment in nonrenal (EXPLORER) and renal (LUNAR) lupus. A systematic review of studies exploring the efficacy of RTX in SLE patients was conducted. The pooled percentages of response were assessed. Thirty studies with 1243 patients were analyzed. In studies using the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG), the complete response (CR) rate was 46. 7 % (95 % CI 36. 8 %- 56. 8 %) and the partial response (PR) was 37. 9 % (95 % CI 30. 6 %- 45. 8 %). With the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), the CR was 56. 6 % (95 % CI 32. 4 %- 78. 1 %) and the PR was 30. 9 % (95 % CI 8. 9 %- 46 %). In renal lupus the CR was 36. 1 % (95 % CI 25. 2 %- 48. 6 %); PR was 37. 4 % (95 % CI 28. 5 %- 47. 3 %). In EXPLORER, CR was 12. 4 % and PR was 17. 2 %; in LUNAR CR was 26. 4 % and PR was 30. 6 %, in both cases not different from controls. Assessment and standardization of SLE response to treatment remain a challenge. The discrepancy in the perceived efficacy of RTX between controlled and observational studies reflects the heterogeneity of lupus and stringency in criteria of response. Further randomized trials focusing on selected SLE manifestations and using composite response <b>indices</b> are <b>warranted...</b>|$|R
