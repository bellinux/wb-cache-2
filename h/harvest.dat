The fan disc also features official character art of Inoue, a supporting character who was not illustrated in Rewrite. Unlike Rewrite, Kotarou is fully voiced in the fan disc.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} at Upper Hill Dipterocarp forest in Malaysia to assess the response of suspended sediment (SS) accumulat ion on improved <b>harvesting</b> protocol {{in comparison with the}} current <b>harvesting</b> protocol. The assessment was made before, during and after timber <b>harvesting</b> since June 2009 until December 2011. It was found that the response of SS accumulation in catchment under current <b>harvesting</b> protoco l was higher as compared to improved <b>harvesting</b> protocol during <b>harvesting.</b> Assessment on accumulative SS in the river at two different <b>harvesting</b> regimes showed that streams under the improved <b>harvesting</b> protocol have less accumulative SS as compared with current <b>harvesting</b> protocol even though the coverage area was bigger than current <b>harvesting</b> protocol. Total amount of SS accumulated in streams under the current <b>harvesting</b> protocol was 5, 228, 008. 50 mg / l which was 87, 797. 50 mg/l more than improved harve sting protocol (5, 249, 895. 75 mg/l) during timber <b>harvesting.</b> Maximum SS accumulat ion for current <b>harvesting</b> protocol was 1, 861, 246. 50 mg/l, 1, 530, 744. 75 mg/l (improved <b>harvesting</b> protocol) and 499, 962. 00 mg/l (control). However, the total SS accumulat ion decreased gradually after t imber <b>harvesting</b> to 1, 942, 661. 50 mg / l, 861, 190. 25 mg / l and 62, 646. 75 mg / l for current <b>harvesting</b> protocol, improved <b>harvesting</b> protocol and control respectively. Large reduction in SS accumulation was observed under improved <b>harvesting</b> protocol ranging between 1, 307, 212 mg/l at 19 cm of water level to 428, 622 mg/l at the highest water level (59 cm). The accumulation of SS decreased about two to seven fold on the following year after <b>harvesting</b> processes completed at stream under current and improved <b>harvesting</b> protocol...|$|R

5|$|Another {{concern is}} the fact that {{sugarcane}} fields are traditionally burned just before <b>harvest</b> to avoid harm to the workers, by removing the sharp leaves and killing snakes and other harmful animals, and also to fertilize the fields with ash. Mechanization will reduce pollution from burning fields and has higher productivity than people, and due to mechanization the number of temporary workers in the sugarcane plantations has already declined.

Although the estate adopted machine <b>harvesting</b> method in {{a quest to}} resolve imminent financial problems faced at Southdown the costs kept escalating. Therefore this study was undertaken to compare the two <b>harvesting</b> methods (hand <b>harvesting</b> method and machine <b>harvesting</b> method) in order to evaluate {{the costs and benefits}} for the two <b>harvesting</b> methods in tea production. In order to answer the first objective which was assessing the financial viability of machine versus hand picking in tea production a gross margin was used. The second objective was to compare costs and benefits of hand picking versus machine <b>harvesting</b> method and a cost and benefit analysis was conducted to attain the second objective. The results revealed that machine <b>harvesting</b> method is more viable than hand picking because it yielded a higher gross margin of US 17639. 36 as compared to hand <b>harvesting</b> method which yielded a gross margin of US 9534. 34. The second objective was to compare {{the costs and benefits of}} machine and hand picking <b>harvesting</b> methods. NPV, IRR and BCR were used as decision criteria. NPV for machine <b>harvesting</b> method was US 28603. 55 and US 21106. 37 for hand <b>harvesting</b> method. IRR for machine <b>harvesting</b> method was 46...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the <b>harvesting</b> {{of a population}} in a stochastic environment whose dynamics {{in the absence of}} <b>harvesting</b> are described by the logistic Verhulst-Pearl model. Using ergodic optimal control, we find the optimal <b>harvesting</b> strategy which maximizes the asymptotic yield of <b>harvested</b> individuals. To our knowledge, ergodic optimal control has not been used before to study <b>harvesting</b> strategies. However, it is a natural framework because the optimal <b>harvesting</b> strategy will never be such that the population is <b>harvested</b> to extinction [...] instead the <b>harvested</b> population converges to a unique invariant probability measure. When the yield function is the identity, we show that the optimal strategy has a bang-bang property: there exists a threshold $x^*> 0 $ such that whenever the population is under the threshold the <b>harvesting</b> rate must be zero, whereas when the population is above the threshold the <b>harvesting</b> rate must be at the upper limit. We provide upper and lower bounds on the maximal asymptotic yield, and explore via numerical simulations how the <b>harvesting</b> threshold and the maximal asymptotic yield change with the growth rate, maximal <b>harvesting</b> rate or the competition rate. In the case when the yield function is strictly concave, we prove that the optimal <b>harvesting</b> strategy is continuous. Comment: 27 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
30|$|There {{are three}} types of harvesting: (1) {{constant}} <b>harvesting</b> [26, 27]; (2) linear <b>harvesting</b> [28 – 32]; and (3) nonlinear <b>harvesting</b> [22 – 24, 33]. As we know, nonlinear <b>harvesting</b> is more realistic from biological and economical points of view [22]. Clark [23] first proposed a <b>harvesting</b> term h=qEx/cE+lx, which is named Michaelis–Menten type functional form of catch rate. Hu and Cao [24] studied the stability and bifurcation of the system with the Michaelis–Menten type <b>harvesting</b> in predator.|$|R

5|$|During the 1970s, {{improvements}} in natural resource management techniques emerged, along with increased concerns about otter population declines in North America. Consequently, many wildlife management agencies developed strategies to restore or enhance otter populations, {{including the use}} of reintroduction projects. Since 1976, over 4,000 otters have been reintroduced in 21 U.S. states. All Canadian provinces except Prince Edward Island and 29 U.S. states have viable populations that sustain annual harvests. Annual <b>harvest</b> numbers of northern river otters are similar for Canada and the United States, with most pelts being used in the garment industry. In the late 1970s, annual <b>harvest</b> in North America reached approximately 50,000 pelts, for a value of US$3 million. Otters are inadvertently harvested by traps set for beavers, and therefore management plans should consider both species simultaneously. While current <b>harvest</b> strategies do not pose a threat to maintaining otter populations, <b>harvest</b> may limit expansion of otter populations in some areas. Otter harvests correlate positively with the beaver harvests and with the average beaver pelt price from the preceding year. Fur of the river otter is thick and lustrous and is the most durable of Native American furs. River otter pelts are used as the standard for rating the quality of other pelts.|$|E

In the Western Ghats, India, epiphytic macrolichens are <b>harvested</b> by Paliyan tribes to generate supplementary income. Paliyan tribes employ two <b>harvesting</b> methods: shallow <b>harvesting,</b> {{with a minimum of}} attached bark substratum, and deep <b>harvesting,</b> which exposes the sapwood.
