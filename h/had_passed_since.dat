5|$|By April 2010 {{almost five}} years <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> the {{previous}} general election (held on 5 May 2005), requiring a fresh election to take place. On 6 April 2010 Brown went to Buckingham Palace to ask the Queen to dissolve Parliament on 12 April {{in preparation for a}} general election. In a live press conference at Downing Street, Brown announced the election would be held on 6 May. The time between the announcement of the election and the dissolution of Parliament, known as wash-up, was to allow for the handling of any unfinished legislative business before the Parliamentary session's conclusion.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} January 1945, {{the highly}} {{purified}} plutonium underwent further concentration in the completed chemical isolation building, where remaining impurities were removed successfully. Los Alamos received its first plutonium from Hanford on February 2. While it was still by no means clear that enough plutonium could be produced for use in bombs by the war's end, Hanford was by early 1945 in operation. Only two years <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> Col. Franklin Matthias first set up his temporary headquarters {{on the banks of}} the Columbia River.|$|E
5|$|Dietrich's other {{argument}} {{was that the}} trial judge should have used discretionary powers and granted an adjournment until Dietrich was able to provide counsel himself, and that the {{failure to do so}} caused a miscarriage of justice. Dietrich had asked the trial judge for an adjournment during the trial, but the judge said that since more than a year <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> the offence occurred, it was {{in the interests of the}} community that the matter be dealt with promptly.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, having {{arranged}} for a private investigation of Hendrix's death, Etchingham supplied {{the results of the}} effort to UK authorities and requested they reopen the coroner's inquest. After a several-month inquiry by Scotland Yard, during which every interested party to the events was interviewed, officials were confident the request would be granted. The investigation eventually proved inconclusive in 1993, when Attorney General Sir Nicholas Lyell decided that proceeding with the investigation would not serve the public, {{due in part to the}} excessive time that <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> Hendrix's death.|$|E
5|$|In April 1958, Eisenhower asked Congress for {{legislation}} {{to overhaul the}} Department of Defense. Over a decade <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> the legislation which had established it, and {{he was concerned about}} the degree of inter-service rivalry, duplication and mismanagement that was evident in many programs. In ballistic missile development, the Soviet Sputnik program had demonstrated that country's technological lead over the United States. The Army and Air Force had rival programs, PGM-19 Jupiter and PGM-17 Thor respectively, and the additional cost to the taxpayers of developing two systems instead of one was estimated at $500million.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the month}} of May the radio scintillations became less {{noticeable}} until they ceased altogether. This implies that the radio source significantly expanded {{in the time that}} <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> the burst was detected. Using the known distance to the source and the elapsed time before the scintillation ended, Frail calculated that the radio source had expanded at almost the speed of light. While various existing models already encompassed the notion of a relativistically expanding fireball, this was the first strong evidence to support such a model.|$|E

5|$|After an {{hour and}} a half had gone (and twenty minutes <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> the second attack) the Indonesians {{launched}} a third and final attack up the slope towards the base, which the British responded to with artillery and grenade fire. This defence was remarkably effective, and eventually the barrage of Indonesian rocket fire halted and the few remaining British soldiers rose from their hideouts and began to clear the perimeter. Soon afterwards, Gurkha soldiers and medical staff arrived at the base by helicopter, leaving the soldiers behind to secure the area and airlifting the wounded to a nearby hospital. By this point, however, Indonesian forces had withdrawn, effectively ending the battle.|$|E
5|$|More {{than twenty}} years <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> Dave Guard had left the group, but {{residual}} tension surfaced between Guard and Shane {{in an article in}} The Wall Street Journal that appeared in March 1982 following the national broadcast of the taped show. Guard implicitly disparaged Shane's current group, and Shane asserted a distaste for performing again with Guard, who had spent the intervening decades living and performing in Australia, touring sporadically as a soloist, and writing about and teaching music. Despite the unpleasantness, Shane and Guard reconciled to a large degree (even to the point of planning a possible reunion tour) prior to Guard's death at age 56 from lymphoma nine years later in March 1991.|$|E
5|$|Numismatist Bruce C. Goldstein {{indicated}} that several factors combined {{to keep the}} nickel three-cent piece in decline {{after the passage of}} the 1873 act. Less and less fractional currency was being redeemed, as almost a decade <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> the issuance of three-cent notes. Rich silver strikes in the West lowered the price of that metal to the point where old silver coins emerged from hoarding and circulated again. These factors, combined with ample stocks of cents and nickels, made the three-cent nickel, a non-silver coin of odd denomination, less desirable. By 1876, the mintage for circulation had declined to 162,000. None were struck for circulation in 1877 and 1878, though some proof coins were minted for sale to the public.|$|E

5|$|The idea of {{it being}} a simpler project due to the {{original}} art being reusable {{turned out to be}} untrue: because so much time <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> the original's release, there were multiple parts that had to be reworked, leading to a process similar to creating a whole new game from scratch. All character graphics were redone, special effects were changed, and certain animations were added, such as sleeping animations. Some item placements were changed, the overall difficulty was adjusted, and some characters' battle statistics were altered; one such instance was making Kechi stronger than Oryu, due to it being perceived as illogical that a person with a sword would be weaker than a person fighting with her bare hands.|$|E
5|$|As Brazil {{had been}} pacified {{after the end}} of the last {{rebellion}} (the Praieira revolt), Brazil's government turned its attention to the growing tensions with its neighbor to the south, the Argentine Confederation. Paulino Soares, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, decided to forge alliances with Uruguay and Paraguay, nations which also saw a threat in the ambitions of Juan Manuel de Rosas, dictator of the Argentine Confederation. An army commanded by Caxias crossed into Uruguay in September 1851. More than a year <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> Honório Hermeto returned from Pernambuco, when he was named by Paulino Soares as special minister plenipotentiary in the Plata region. On 12 October 1851, Honório Hermeto and an Uruguayan envoy signed a treaty in Rio de Janeiro setting the international border between Brazil and Uruguay. The agreement required Uruguay to abandon some claims to disputed areas in exchange for Brazilian aid in the war against Argentina.|$|E
5|$|As a young man, Manuel {{had been}} {{determined}} to restore by force of arms the predominance of the Byzantine Empire in the Mediterranean countries. By the time he died in 1180, 37 years <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> that momentous day in 1143 when, amid the wilds of Cilicia, his father had proclaimed him emperor. These years had seen Manuel involved in conflict with his neighbours on all sides. Manuel's father and grandfather before him had worked patiently to undo {{the damage done by}} the battle of Manzikert and its aftermath. Thanks to their efforts, the empire Manuel inherited was stronger and better organised than at any time for a century. While it is clear that Manuel used these assets to the full, it is not so clear how much he added to them, and there is room for doubt as to whether he used them to best effect.|$|E

Scarcely fifty years <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> its appearance in Spain {{before it was}} quoted by many Kabbalists, including the Italian mystical writer Menahem Recanati and by Todros Abulafia.

25|$|The {{associated}} {{attacks against}} the European settlements continued into the 1520s, with natives arriving by canoe, killing as many Spanish as possible and leaving afterwards with freed Taíno and African slaves. Such incursions were reported in 1520, 1526 and 1528, with one last attack recorded in the haciendas of Daguao in 1529. Then, after two decades <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> the events that began the conflict, the offensive suddenly halted.|$|E
25|$|The American {{build up}} in the ETO was slow.

Small formations of USAAF B-17s had operated over France and the Low Countries from July 1942 onwards, but like the RAF missions of 1940–1941, achieved little.
