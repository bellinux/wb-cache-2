25|$|Denmark has {{the fourth}} highest ratio of {{tertiary}} degree holders in the world. The country ranks {{highest in the}} world for workers' rights. GDP per hour worked was the 13th highest in 2009. The country has a market income inequality close to the OECD average, but after public cash transfers the income inequality is very low. According to the International Monetary Fund, Denmark has the world's highest minimum wage. As Denmark has no minimum wage legislation, the high wage floor has been attributed to the power of trade unions. For example, {{as the result of a}} collective bargaining agreement between the 3F trade union and the <b>employers</b> <b>group</b> , workers at McDonald's and other fast food chains make the equivalent of US$20 an hour, which is more than double what their counterparts earn in the United States, and have access to five weeks' paid vacation, parental leave and a pension plan.
