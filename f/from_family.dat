30|$|Generally, {{students}} who came <b>from</b> business-owned <b>family</b> {{are more likely}} to be self-employed compared to {{students who}} came <b>from</b> non-business-owned <b>families.</b> But students who have business-owned colleagues are not significantly different from students who do not have business-owned colleagues. Table  8 tells us that students who came <b>from</b> business-owned <b>families</b> were 25.4 % (OR[*]=[*] 1.254) more likely to be self-employed compared to students who came <b>from</b> non-business-owned <b>families.</b> The reason might be that they may have prior business experience <b>from</b> <b>families.</b> The experience gained <b>from</b> their <b>family</b> member may influence the students’ engagement in entrepreneurship. This is in agreement with the findings in other studies (Fitzsimmons and Douglass, 2005; Dohse and Walter, 2012; Sanditov and Verspagen, 2011; Robson, 2015).

5|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD), also {{referred}} to simply as Alzheimer's, is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and worsens over time. It {{is the cause of}} 60% to 70% of cases of dementia. The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events (short-term memory loss). As the disease advances, symptoms can include problems with language, disorientation (including easily getting lost), mood swings, loss of motivation, not managing self care, and behavioural issues. As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw <b>from</b> <b>family</b> and society. Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death. Although the speed of progression can vary, the average life expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine years.|$|E

Individual rooms {{containing}} a sofa, sink, and cupboard with sheets, towels, and condoms are available for single-person visits. For those with families, a larger room with toys and baby-changing facilities is available. Inmates are checked after visits, and if illegal items are found, prisoners can lose their rights to private visits. This right is denied to high risk criminals and visitors with histories of drug offenses. There is also a separated, chalet-style house where prisoners can receive visits <b>from</b> <b>family</b> members and stay with them for 24 hours.

5|$|Once {{patients}} {{reach their}} teens, {{they need more}} specific information about pregnancy, birth control, self-esteem, and dating. Teenagers with lost or reduced genital sensation benefit from education about alternative ways to experience pleasure and satisfaction from sexual acts.

Given the importance they place on sexuality and privacy, adolescents may experience humiliation when parents or caregivers bathe them or take care of bowel and bladder needs. They can benefit from sexuality counseling, support groups, and mentoring by adults with SCI who can share experiences and lead discussions with peers. With the right care and education <b>from</b> <b>family</b> and professionals, injured children and adolescents can develop into sexually healthy adults.|$|E
