50|$|Less {{fish and}} more meat is eaten {{away from the}} coast. Other typical {{products}} are sausages such as Soppressa Vicentina, <b>garlic</b> <b>salami,</b> Piave cheese and Asiago cheese. High quality vegetables are prized, such as red radicchio from Treviso and white asparagus from Bassano del Grappa. Perhaps the most popular dish of Venice is fegato alla veneziana, thinly-sliced veal liver sauteed with onions.|$|E
50|$|The two reeler short {{comedy is}} set in the mythical country of Jugo-Jaggon, where the manufacture, sale, or {{possession}} of salami is prohibited by law. Despite this, the country is {{in the grip of a}} salami addiction crisis. International Agents Blackstone and Blodgett (Clark and McCullough) are hired by Nikki (Charles Irwin), the Prime Minister, to find out who is smuggling 4% <b>garlic</b> <b>salami</b> into the kingdom.|$|E
6000|$|They {{had decided}} to walk down in a leisurely fashion, but with the {{fatigues}} of the precipitous clamber down from Switzerland still upon them they found the white road between rock above and gorge below wearisome, and the valley hot in the late morning sunshine, and already before they reached the inn they had marked for lunch Amanda had suggested driving {{the rest of the}} way. The inn had a number of brigand-like customers consuming such sustenance as <b>garlic</b> and <b>salami</b> and wine; it received them with an indifference that bordered on disrespect, until the landlord, who seemed to be something of a beauty himself, discovered the merits of Amanda. Then he became markedly attentive. He was a large, fat, curly-headed person with beautiful eyes, a cherished moustache, and an air of great gentility, and when he had welcomed his guests and driven off the slatternly waiting-maid, and given them his best table, and consented, at Amanda's request, to open a window, he went away and put on a tie and collar. It was an attention so conspicuous that even the group of men in the far corner noticed and commented on it, and then they commented on Amanda and Benham, assuming an ignorance of Italian in the visitors that was only partly justifiable. [...] "Bellissima," [...] "bravissima," [...] "signorina," [...] "Inglesa," [...] one need not be born in Italy to understand such words as these. Also they addressed sly comments and encouragements to the landlord as he went to and fro.|$|R
