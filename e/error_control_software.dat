40|$|A {{control system}} has been {{designed}} to keep a balloon-borne scientific instrument pointed toward a celestial object within an angular error of the order of an arc second. The design is intended to be adaptable to a large range of instrument payloads. The initial payload to which the design nominally applies {{is considered to be a}} telescope, modeled as a simple thin-walled cylinder 24 ft (approx. = 7. 3 m) long, 3 ft (approx. = 0. 91 m) in diameter, weighing 1, 500 lb (having a mass of. 680 kg). The instrument would be mounted on a set of motor-driven gimbals in pitch-yaw configuration. The motors on the gimbals would apply the control torques needed for fine adjustments of the instrument in pitch and yaw. The pitch-yaw mount would, in turn, be suspended from a motor mount at the lower end of a pair of cables hanging down from the balloon (see figure). The motor in this mount would be used to effect coarse azimuth control of the pitch-yaw mount. A notable innovation incorporated in the design is a provision for keeping the gimbal bearings in constant motion. This innovation would eliminate the deleterious effects of static friction. something that must be done in order to achieve the desired arc-second precision. Another notable innovation is the use of linear accelerometers to provide feedback that would facilitate the early detection and counteraction of disturbance torques before they could integrate into significant angular-velocity and angular-position <b>errors.</b> The <b>control</b> <b>software</b> processing the sensor data would be capable of distinguishing between translational and rotational accelerations. The output of the accelerometers is combined with that of angular position and angular-velocity sensors into a proportional + integral + derivative + acceleration control law for the pitch and yaw torque motors. Preliminary calculations have shown that with appropriate gains, the power demand of the control system would be low enough to be satisfiable by means of storage batteries charged by solar batteries during the day...|$|R

By moving the mobile platform in the environment and attaching a set of static tags to objects, one can localize these objects. It is especially useful in cases where permanent location infras-tructure does not exist yet or too expensive to install. To localize tags, data has to be collected at various points and then fused to create a consistent location map of tags. One serious problem with such a procedure is that error from measurements propagates and accumulates. In this paper, we present an <b>error</b> <b>control</b> mechanism to reduce this effect.

DeVaultPrakash KrishnaswamiMost {{state-of-the-art}} {{systems are}} multidisciplinary {{in nature and}} encompass {{a wide range of}} components from domains such as electronics, mechanics, hydraulics, etc. Design considerations and design parameters of the system can come from any or a combination of these domains. The traditional optimization approach for multidisciplinary systems utilizes sequential optimization, wherein each subsystem is optimized in isolation in a predetermined order, assuming that the designs of the other subsystems remain fixed. This often leads to system designs that are suboptimal. In recent years emphasis has been placed on development of an integrated scheme for analysis and design of multidisciplinary systems. An important aspect is the software architecture required to support such a scheme. This dissertation presents MIXEDMODELS (Multidisciplinary Integrated eXtensible Engine for Driving Metamodeling, Optimization and DEsign of Large-scale Systems) - a unified analysis and design tool for multidisciplinary systems that is based on a procedural, symbolic-numeric architecture. This architecture offers great modeling flexibility at the component level, allowing any engineer to add components in his/her domain of expertise to the platform in a modular fashion. The symbolic engine in the MIXEDMODELS platform synthesizes the system governing equations as a unified set of nonlinear differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). These equations are differentiated with respect to design variables to obtain an additional set of DAEs that describe the sensitivity coefficients of the system state variables. This combined set of DAEs is solved numerically to obtain the solution for the state variables and the state sensitivity coefficients of the system. Finally, knowing the system performance functions, their design sensitivity coefficients can be calculated by using the values of the state variables and state sensitivity coefficients obtained from the DAEs. For ease in <b>error</b> <b>control</b> and <b>software</b> implementation, sensitivity analysis formulation described in this work uses direct differentiation approach as opposed to the adjoint variable approach. The MIXEDMODELS capabilities are demonstrated through several numerical examples and the results indicate that the MIXEDMODELS formulation and architecture is effective in terms of accuracy, modeling convenience, computational efficiency, and the ability to simulate the behavior of a general class of multidisciplinary systems...|$|R
