5|$|Cave 3 is {{earliest}} dated Hindu {{temple in}} the Deccan region. It {{is dedicated to}} Vishnu; {{it is the largest}} cave in the complex. It has intricately carved friezes and giant figures of Trivikrama, Anantasayana, Vasudeva, Varaha, Harihara and Narasimha. Cave3's primary theme is Vaishnavite, though <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>shows</b> Harihara on its southern wall half Vishnu and half Shiva shown fused as one, making the cave important to Shaivism studies.|$|E
5|$|Ruma Maida (released internationally as Maida's House) is a 2009 Indonesian film {{written by}} Ayu Utami, {{directed}} by Teddy Soeriaatmadja and starring Atiqah Hasiholan, , Nino Fernandez, and Frans Tumbuan.

5|$|The only decorations in the {{manuscript}} are decorative tail-pieces {{at the end of}} each book (see illustration) and <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>shows</b> a tendency to increase the size of the first letter of each sentence. The capitals at the beginning of the sections stand out in the margin as in codices Ephraemi and Basilensis. Codex Alexandrinus is the oldest manuscript to use capital letters to indicate new sections.|$|E

5|$|The {{periodic}} {{table is a}} tabular arrangement of the chemical elements, ordered by their atomic number, electron configurations, and recurring chemical properties. This ordering shows periodic trends, such as elements with similar behaviour in the same column. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>shows</b> four rectangular blocks with some approximately similar chemical properties. In general, within one row (period) the elements are metals on the left, and non-metals on the right.|$|E
5|$|The bulk {{properties}} of astatine {{are not known}} with any certainty. Many {{of them have been}} estimated based on the element's position on the periodic table as a heavier analog of iodine, {{and a member of the}} halogens (the group of elements including fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine). Astatine is likely to have a dark or lustrous appearance and may be a semiconductor or possibly a metal; it probably has a higher melting point than that of iodine. Chemically, several anionic species of astatine are known and most of its compounds resemble those of iodine. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>shows</b> some metallic behavior, including being able to form a stable monatomic cation in aqueous solution (unlike the lighter halogens).|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of polonium {{is similar to}} that of tellurium, although <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>shows</b> some similarities to its neighbor bismuth due to its metallic character. Polonium dissolves readily in dilute acids but is only slightly soluble in alkalis. Polonium solutions are first colored in pink by the Po2+ ions, but then rapidly become yellow because alpha radiation from polonium ionizes the solvent and converts Po2+ into Po4+. This process is accompanied by bubbling and emission of heat and light by glassware due to the absorbed alpha particles; as a result, polonium solutions are volatile and will evaporate within days unless sealed. At pH about 1, polonium ions are readily hydrolyzed and complexed by acids such as oxalic acid, citric acid, and tartaric acid.|$|E
50|$|As HP CAS <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>showed</b> {{up in the}} HP 40G, 40gs, 49g+, 48gII and 50g and was {{maintained}} by Parisse up to 2006.|$|R

25|$|The airline {{was owned}} by the Italian {{government}} and predominantly featured the Italian flag on its aircraft. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>showed</b> the fascism symbol in some routes.|$|R
5|$|The south transept's {{southern}} wall {{is nearly}} complete, displaying the fine workmanship {{of the first}} phase. It shows the Gothic pointed arch style in the windows that first appeared in France in the mid-12th century and was apparent in England around 1170, but hardly appeared in Scotland until the early 13th century. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>shows</b> the round early Norman window design that continued {{to be used in}} Scotland during the entire Gothic period (Fig. 6). The windows and the quoins are of finely cut ashlar sandstone. A doorway in the south-west portion of the wall has large mouldings and has a pointed oval window placed above it. Adjacent to the doorway are two lancet-arched windows that are topped at the clerestory level with three round-headed windows. The north transept has much less of its structure preserved, but much of what does remain, taken together with a study by John Slezer in 1693, shows that it was similar to the south transept, except that the north transept had no external door and featured a stone turret containing a staircase.|$|E
25|$|Lloyd's Register for 1846 shows Santry as master, Haviside, owner, and trade: London. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>shows</b> {{that she}} was rebuilt in 1843.|$|E
25|$|Diogo Ribeiro, a Portuguese {{cartographer}} {{working for}} Spain, made {{what is considered}} the first scientific world map: the 1527 Padrón real. The layout of the map (Mapamundi) is strongly influenced by the information obtained during the Magellan-Elcano trip around the world. Diogo's map delineates very precisely the coasts of Central and South America. The map shows, for the first time, the real extension of the Pacific Ocean. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>shows,</b> for the first time, the North American coast as a continuous one (probably influenced by the Esteban Gómez's exploration in 1525). <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>shows</b> the demarcation of the Treaty of Tordesillas.|$|E
50|$|The first Pokémon 3D short {{that was}} shown as the PokéPark in Japan in 2005, and <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>shown</b> when PokéPark was in Taiwan in 2006.|$|R

50|$|KIAA1704 {{promoter}} {{showed significant}} histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation peaks in K562 cells (erythroid cell line). <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>showed</b> increased relative expression in erythroid progenitors along with gene neighbors, NUFIP1 and TPT1.|$|R
25|$|This patch was not {{designed}} by NASA but by the engineers at Grumman who designed and built the Lunar Module. It portrays the fire-in-the-hole test. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>shows</b> the LM without landing gear and with the Moon on the right.|$|E
25|$|This {{establishes}} {{the existence of}} homeomorphic solutions of Beltrami's equation {{in the case of}} Beltrami coefficients of compact support. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>shows</b> that the inverse homeomorphisms and composed homeomorphisms satisfy Beltrami equations and that all computations can be performed by restricting to regular sets.|$|E
25|$|Each year, the Olympia Film Society (OFS) {{produces}} a film festival and fosters {{film and video}} education in Olympia. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>shows</b> independent, classic, and international films year-round at the art-deco Capitol Theater.

25|$|The oldest {{surviving}} work of Persian {{literary criticism}} after the Islamic conquest of Persia is Muqaddame-ye Shahname-ye Abu Mansuri, {{which was written}} during the Samanid period. The work deals with the myths and legends of Shahname and is considered the oldest surviving example of Persian prose. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>shows</b> {{an attempt by the}} authors to evaluate literary works critically.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of the Shin Kokinshū echoes that of the Kokinshū in many ways, but <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>shows</b> {{the influence of the}} intervening imperial anthologies. As {{can be seen in the}} table below, the Shin Kokinshū omits certain books from the original anthology, and includes others on poetic topics that gained prominence only after the publication of the Kokinshū.|$|E
25|$|In {{this table}} {{one can see}} the results of the Greens for the six direct {{elections}} to the European Parliament, in terms of seats and votes. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>shows</b> how many European Commissioners the European Greens have, who led the parliamentary group.
