5|$|Controversy {{has arisen}} since the {{creation}} of the awards; there have been two occasions when no award was given because no titles were judged to be odd enough, Bent has complained about some of the winners chosen by the public, and the 2008 winner, The 2009–2014 World Outlook for 60-milligram Containers of Fromage <b>Frais,</b> proved controversial because rather than being written by its listed author, Philip M. Parker, it was instead written by a machine of Parker's invention. The most recent winner, in July 2017, was The Commuter Pig Keeper: A Comprehensive Guide to Keeping Pigs when Time is your Most Precious Commodity by Michaela Giles.|$|E

25|$|At about 14:00, the Nawab's army ceased the cannonade {{and began}} turning back north to their entrenchments, leaving St. <b>Frais</b> and his {{artillery}} without support. Seeing the Nawab's forces retiring, Major Kilpatrick, {{who had been}} left {{in charge of the}} British force while Clive was resting in the hunting lodge, recognised the opportunity to cannonade the retiring enemy if St. Frais' position could be captured. Sending an officer to Clive to explain his actions, he took two companies of the 39th Regiment and two field pieces and advanced towards St. Frais' position. When Clive received the message, he hurried to the detachment and reprimanded Kilpatrick for his actions without orders and commanded to bring {{up the rest of the}} army from the grove. Clive himself then led the army against St. Frais' position which was taken at 15:00 when the French artillery retreated to the redoubt of the entrenchment, setting up for further action.|$|E

500|$|In 2009, {{the choice}} of The 2009–2014 World Outlook for 60-milligram Containers of Fromage <b>Frais</b> as winner of the 2008 award was controversial, as Parker did not write the book himself, but used an {{automated}} authoring machine which produces thousands of titles {{on the basis of}} Internet and database searches. Philip Stone, charts editor and awards administrator at The Bookseller, commented by saying: [...] "I think it's slightly controversial as it was written by a computer, but given the number of celebrity memoirs out there that are ghostwritten, I don't think it's too strange." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, {{a new style}} of novel became popular in France. The serial format known as the roman-feuilleton {{presented}} stories in short regular installments, often accompanied by melodramatic plots and stock characters. Although Balzac's La Vieille Fille (The Old Maid), 1836, was the first such work published in France, the roman-feuilleton gained prominence thanks mostly to his friends Eugène Sue and Alexandre Dumas, père. Balzac disliked their serial writing, however, especially Sue's socialist depiction of lower-class suffering. Balzac wanted to dethrone what he called [...] "les faux dieux de cette littérature bâtarde" [...] ("the false gods of this bastard literature"). He also wanted {{to show the world}} that, despite his poor health and tumultuous career, he was [...] "plus jeune, plus <b>frais,</b> et plus grand que jamais" [...] ("younger, fresher, and greater than ever"). His first efforts to render a quality feuilleton were unsuccessful. Even though Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes ("A Harlot High and Low"), published in segments from 1838 to 1847, was celebrated by critics, Balzac complained to Mme. Hanska that he was [...] "doing pure Sue". He tried again in 1844 with Modeste Mignon, but public reactions were mixed. Two years later Balzac began a new project, determined to create something from his [...] "own old pen again".|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Cardinale {{appeared}} in a Philippe Adrien stage production of Tennessee Williams's Sweet Bird of Youth, and in the 2006/2007 season also featured in another Williams play, The Glass Menagerie, directed by Andrea Liberovici, in which she played the character of Amanda. In 2007, Cardinale {{appeared in}} the Aline Issermann comedy film Cherche fiancé tous <b>frais</b> payés, opposite Alexandra Lamy and Bruno Salomone, in a role which Patrick Besson described as [...] "atrocious". After {{a role in the}} TV movie Hold-up à l'italienne (2008), the following year Cardinale starred in the critically acclaimed The String, playing a Tunisian mother who has a tempestuous relationship with her French-educated gay son. Michael D. Klemm of cinemaqueer.com reflected on how the film broke many of the taboos with interracial sexuality and homosexuality. He praised Cardinale's [...] "terrific" [...] acting and portrayal of the [...] "overbearing" [...] mother, likening one scene, where she [...] "brings home a nice girl for Malik (Antonin Stahly) to meet", to Harold and Maude (1971). In 2010, Cardinale received the Golden Orange Best Actress Award at the 47th Antalya [...] "Golden Orange" [...] International Film Festival for her performance as an elderly Italian woman who takes in a young Turkish exchange student in Signora Enrica. [...] The Turkish-Italian co-production was shot in location in Istanbul and Rimini.|$|E

2500|$|At this point, Clive {{realised}} {{that the}} lingering division was Mir Jafar's and concentrated his efforts at capturing the redoubt and hill east of it. Clive ordered a three-pronged attack with simultaneous attacks by two detachments on the redoubt and the hill {{supported by the}} main force in the centre. Two companies of grenadiers of the 39th Regiment, under Major Coote took the hill at 16:30 after the enemy fled without firing a shot. Coote pursued them across the entrenchment. The redoubt was also taken after St. <b>Frais</b> was forced to retreat. By 17:00, the British occupied the entrenchment and the camp left by a dispersing army. The British troops marched on and halted [...] beyond Daudpur at 20:00.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, the British field pieces began a cannonade on the Nawab's camp {{from the}} mound of the larger tank. As a result, many of the Nawab's troops and {{artillery}} started {{coming out of the}} entrenchment. Clive advanced half of his troops and artillery to the smaller tank and the other half to a rising ground [...] to the left of it and started bombarding the entrenchment with greater efficiency, throwing the approaching trains into confusion. The Nawab's troops shot their matchlocks from holes, ditches, hollows and from bushes on the hill east of the redoubt while St. <b>Frais</b> kept up his artillery fire from the redoubt. Cavalry charges were also repulsed by the British field pieces. However, the British force sustained most of its casualties in this phase.|$|E
2500|$|At daybreak on 23 June, the Nawab's army {{emerged from}} their camp and started {{advancing}} towards the grove. Their army consisted of 30,000 infantry of all sorts, armed with matchlocks, swords, pikes and rockets and 20,000 cavalry, armed with swords or long spears, interspersed by 300 pieces of artillery, mostly 32, 24 and 18-pounders. The army {{also included a}} detachment of about 50 French artillerymen under de St. <b>Frais</b> directing their own field pieces. The French took up positions at the larger tank with four light pieces advanced by two larger pieces, {{within a mile of}} the grove. Behind them were a body of 5,000 cavalry and 7,000 infantry commanded by the Nawab's faithful general Mir madan [...] Khan and Diwan Mohanlal. The rest of the army numbering 45,000 formed an arc from the small hill to a position [...] east of the southern angle of the grove, threatening to surround Clive's relatively smaller army. The right arm of their army was commanded by Rai Durlabh, the centre by Yar Lutuf Khan and the left arm closest to the British by Mir Jafar.|$|E

60|$|That night a {{party of}} {{soldiers}} were sent off to search the head of <b>Frais</b> Vallon, and before morning they returned to town with Francisco and his two sons, whom they threw into their old prison the Bagnio, and loaded them heavily with chains.|$|E

60|$|The {{movement}} of retirement at once commenced. The three traitor generals drew off their troops, {{and those of}} Mir Mudin Khan also obeyed orders, and fell back. Saint <b>Frais,</b> however, refused to obey. He saw the ruin which would follow upon the retreat, and he pluckily continued his fire.|$|E
60|$|Strong columns {{were sent}} against each position. The hill was carried without opposition, and then so heavy and searching a fire was {{poured into the}} intrenched camp that the enemy began to fall back, in utter confusion.

60|$|The nabob, {{on hearing}} of Clive's advance, had sent to Monsieur Law; who was, {{with a hundred}} and fifty men, at a place over a hundred miles distant; to which he had, in {{accordance}} with the orders of Clive, been obliged to retire; and begged him to advance to join him, with all speed. The nabob had with him forty or fifty Frenchmen, commanded by Monsieur Saint <b>Frais,</b> formerly one of the council of Chandranagore. These had some field pieces of their own, and also directed the native artillery, of fifty-three guns; principally thirty-two, twenty-four, and eighteen pounders.|$|E
60|$|Had these {{been all}} served by European artillerymen, the British force {{would have been}} speedily annihilated as they stood. The natives of India, however, were {{extremely}} clumsy gunners. They fired but slowly, and had the feeblest idea of elevation. Consequently their balls, for the most part, went far {{over the heads of}} the English; and the four field guns of Saint <b>Frais</b> did more execution than the fifty heavy pieces of the nabob. At the end of half an hour, however, Clive had lost thirty of his men, and determined to fall back to the mango grove.|$|E

60|$|The {{sentinel}} on {{duty was}} {{for a few moments}} bereft of the power of action. Recovering himself, he discharged his musket, and gave the alarm. The whole guard turned out at once and gave chase, but the few moments lost by them had been well used by the fugitives; besides, Despair, Terror, and Hope are powerful stimulators. After running a short time together up the steep ascent of the <b>Frais</b> Vallon, or Fresh Valley, they scattered, according to arrangement, and each man shifted for himself--with the single exception of Mariano, who would not leave his father.|$|E
60|$|At {{eight o'clock}} in the morning, of the 23rd of June, a memorable day {{in the annals of}} India, the {{preparations}} on both sides were complete; and Saint <b>Frais</b> opened the battle, by the discharge of one of his guns at the English. At the signal, the whole of the artillery round the long curve opened their fire. The ten little guns replied to this overwhelming discharge, and for half an hour continued to play on the dense masses of the enemy. But, however well they might be handled, they could do little against the fire of the fifty pieces of cannon, concentrated upon them.|$|E

60|$|The enemy fought bravely. Saint <b>Frais</b> {{worked his}} guns unflinchingly at the redoubt, the {{infantry}} poured in volley after volley, the cavalry made desperate charges {{right up to}} the British lines. But they had no leader, and were fighting against men well commanded, and confident in themselves. Clive observed that the division on the enemy's extreme left remained inactive, and detached from the army; and it, for the first time, struck him that this was the division of Meer Jaffier. Relieved for the safety of his baggage, and from the attack which had hitherto threatened in his rear, he at once determined to carry the hill in advance of Saint Frais's battery, and the redoubt occupied by the French leader.|$|E
