40|$|Certain genetic {{disorders}} are {{rare in the}} general population but more common in individuals with specific trisomies, which suggests that the genes involved in the etiology of these disorders may be located on the trisomic chromosome. As with all aneuploid syndromes, however, a considerable degree of variation exists within each phenotype so that any given trait is present only among a subset of the trisomic population. We have previously presented a simple gene-dosage model to explain this phenotypic variation and developed a strategy to map genes for such traits. The mapping strategy does not depend on the simple model but works in theory under any model that predicts that affected individuals have an increased likelihood of <b>disomic</b> homozygosity at the trait locus. This paper explores the robustness of our mapping method by investigating what kinds of models give an expected increase in <b>disomic</b> homozygosity. We describe a number of basic statistical models for trisomic phenotypes. Some of these are logical extensions of standard models for <b>disomic</b> phenotypes, and some are more specific to trisomy. Where possible, we discuss genetic mechanisms applicable to each model. We investigate which models and which parameter values give an expected increase in <b>disomic</b> homozygosity in individuals with the trait. Finally, we determine the sample sizes required to identify the increased <b>disomic</b> homozygosity under each model. Most of the models we explore yield detectable increases in <b>disomic</b> homozygosity for some reasonable range of parameter values, usually corresponding to smaller trait frequencies. It therefore appears that our mapping method should be effective {{for a wide variety of}} moderately infrequent traits, even though the exact mode of inheritance is unlikely to be known...|$|E

Cryptococcus neoformans {{is the leading cause}} of fungal meningoencephalitis in HIV/AIDS patients, and we recently discovered clinical strains of the fungus that are <b>disomic</b> for chromosome 13. Here, we examined the genome plasticity and phenotypes of monosomic and <b>disomic</b> strains, and compared their virulence in a mouse model of cryptococcosis Results In an initial set of strains, melanin production was correlated with monosomy at chromosome 13, and <b>disomic</b> variants were less melanized and attenuated for virulence in mice. After growth in culture or passage through mice, subsequent strains were identified that varied in melanin formation and exhibited copy number changes for other chromosomes. The correlation between melanin and disomy at chromosome 13 was observed for some but not all strains. A survey of environmental and clinical isolates maintained in culture revealed few occurrences of <b>disomic</b> chromosomes. However, an examination of isolates that were freshly collected from the cerebrospinal fluid of AIDS patients and minimally cultured provided evidence for infections with multiple strains and copy number variation. Conclusions Overall, these results suggest that the genome of C. neoformans exhibits a greater degree of plasticity than previously appreciated. Furthermore, the expression of an essential virulence factor and the severity of disease are associated with genome variation. The occurrence of chromosomal variation in isolates from AIDS patients, combined with the observed influence of disomy on virulence, indicates that genome plasticity may have clinical relevance. </p...|$|E

A 56 -chromosome amphiploid from the cross Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring × Lophopyrum elongatum exceeded Chinese Spring in salt tolerance, measured as plant dry-matter production and seed yield in solution cultures with 250 mM NaCl. Thus, the adaptation of Lophopyrum to saline environments is expressed in the wheat genetic background. None of the <b>disomic</b> additions or substitutions of L. elongatum chromosomes in Chinese Spring showed a similar level of saline stress tolerance, which indicates that the trait depends on the activity of genes {{on more than one}} chromosome. Comparisons of <b>disomic</b> additions, double monosomic additions from half-diallel crosses among <b>disomic</b> additions, and <b>disomic</b> substitutions of L. elongatum chromosomes in Chinese Spring with Chinese Spring indicated that the enhanced salt tolerance of the amphiploid is primarily controlled by genes with minor effects on three of the seven chromosomes, 3 E, 4 E, and 7 E, interacting in a largely additive manner. The salt tolerance of L. elongatum additionally depends on several minor nonadditive gene interactions. It is concluded that the adaptation of L. elongatum to growth in saline environments evolved by accumulation of new alleles in a number of loci, each with a relatively small effect on salt tolerance. It is further inferred that most of these new alleles were codominant to the original alleles and were able to act independently in enhancing salt tolerance...|$|E

After growth in culture or passage through mice, subsequent strains were identified that varied in melanin formation and exhibited copy number changes for other chromosomes. The correlation between melanin and disomy at chromosome 13 was observed for some but not all strains. A survey of environmental and clinical isolates maintained in culture revealed few occurrences of <b>disomic</b> chromosomes. However, an examination of isolates that were freshly collected from the cerebrospinal fluid of AIDS patients and minimally cultured provided evidence for infections with multiple strains and copy number variation. Conclusions: Overall, these results suggest that the genome of C. neoformans exhibits a greater degree of plasticity than previously appreciated. Furthermore, the expression of an essential virulence factor and the severity of disease are associated with genome variation. The occurrence of chromosomal variation in isolates from AIDS patients, combined with the observed influence of disomy on virulence, indicates that genome plasticity may have clinical relevance...|$|E
40|$|AIMS—To {{examine the}} age of onset of insulin {{dependent}} diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in children with Down's syndrome compared with non-trisomic individuals, and to assess whether differences {{might be related to}} <b>disomic</b> homozygosity at the autoimmune polyglandular disease type 1 (APECED) gene locus.  METHODS—Children with Down's syndrome and IDDM were identified through the Down's syndrome association newsletter and from paediatricians. DNA was extracted from mouthbrush preparations provided by the parents and patients using standard techniques. Mapping techniques were then used to identify areas of reduction to homozygosity, including a marker that overlaps the locus for APECED. The frequency of <b>disomic</b> homozygosity for all markers (n = 18) was compared with a control group of 99 patients with Down's syndrome and their parents. The families also answered a questionnaire concerning diabetes and related autoimmune conditions in the family. Details were compared with the British Paediatric Surveillance Group 1988 diabetes study.  RESULTS—Children with Down's syndrome and IDDM were diagnosed significantly earlier than the general population (6. 7 v 8. 0 years) with a far higher proportion diagnosed in the first 2 years of life (22 % v 7 %). There was no evidence of increased <b>disomic</b> homozygosity in the region of the APECED locus in Down's syndrome patients with IDDM compared with simple Down's syndrome.  CONCLUSIONS—The natural history of IDDM in Down's syndrome is {{different from that of the}} general population. Although children with Down's syndrome have features similar to cases of APECED, <b>disomic</b> homozygosity in this region does not explain the predilection for autoimmune disease. ...|$|E
40|$|Fluorescence in situ {{hybridization}} with repetitive-sequence DNA probes {{was used}} to detect human sperm <b>disomic</b> for chromosomes 1 and Y in three healthy men. Data on these same men had been obtained previously, using the human-sperm/hamster-egg cytogenetic technique, providing a cytogenetic reference for validating sperm hybridization measurements. Air-dried smears were prepared from semen samples and treated with DTT and lithium diiodosalicylate to expand sperm chromatin. Hybridization with fluorescently tagged DNA probes for chromosomes 1 (pUC 177) or Y (pY 3. 4) yielded average frequencies of sperm with two fluorescent domains of 14. 2 +/- 2. 4 / 10, 000 and 5. 6 +/- 1. 6 / 10, 000 sperm, respectively. These frequencies did not differ statistically from frequencies of hyperploidy observed for these chromosomes with the hamster technique. In addition, frequencies of <b>disomic</b> sperm from one donor were elevated approximately 2. 5 -fold above those of other donors, for both chromosomes 1 (P =. 045) and Y (P =. 01), consistent with a trend found with the hamster technique. We conclude that fluorescence {{in situ hybridization}} to sperm chromosomes provides a valid and promising measure of the frequency of <b>disomic</b> human sperm...|$|E
40|$|Rye {{and wheat}} {{can easily be}} crossed, {{providing}} the possibility to create <b>disomic</b> addition lines, which contain a pair of homologous chromosomes of rye in the genetic background of wheat. We obtained and used a set of Chinese Spring-Imperial (CS-IMP) <b>disomic</b> addition lines for facilitating the location of genes responsible for P starvation tolerance and root secretion of APase on the specific chromosome(s) of rye. A soil culture experiment showed that different chromosomes of Imperial rye {{in the background of}} common wheat Chinese Spring (CS) contributed differently to the trait investigated. Chromosome 1 R and 7 R of rye might carry genes responsible for tolerance to Pi starvation stress, while 5 R might carry unfavorable genes regarding Pi starvation tolerance. APase activities of different <b>disomic</b> addition lines as well as background parent CS were 1 similar to 12 and 2 similar to 6 folds higher under Pi starvation conditions than under Pi sufficient conditions in terms of APase secretion on individual plant root system basis (mug/plant per h) and on unit dry root weight basis (mug/g per h) respectively. Among 7 <b>disomic</b> addition lines, DA 1 R secreted more APase than the rest of lines in both parameters mentioned above under Pi starvation condition. IEF (Iso-electric Focussing) diagram of APase isozymes clearly showed that chromosome 1 R carries Pi starvation-inducible APase genes. Our results showed that genes conferring Pi starvation tolerance might be carried on 1 R and 7 R in the genome of rye, and the Pi starvation-inducible APase gene(s) carried in 1 R might be one of the reasons of the better performance of line 1 R under Pi starvation condition...|$|E
40|$|The mode of {{inheritance}} of six enzyme markers in the octo-ploid alpine plant Cerastium alpinum was analyzed. Offspring from crosses between heterozygotes showed fixed heterozy-gosity at malate dehydrogenase- 2, phosphoglucoisomerase- 2, triosephosphate isomerase- 2,andtriosephosphateisomerase- 3. Phosphoglucomutase- 1 also showed fixed heterozygosity except in offspring from one cross. Fixed heterozygosity in five enzyme systems suggests that C. alpinum has origi-nated {{through at least}} some allopolyploidization. Offspring from plants heterozygous for two alleles at the menadione reductase- 1 (Mr- 1) locus did not deviate significantly from a 1 : 2 : 1 ratio. The large proportion of homozygotes suggests <b>disomic</b> inheritance because any kind of polysomic inheritance {{would result in a}} substantially increased proportion of hetero-zygotes relative to <b>disomic</b> inheritance.
