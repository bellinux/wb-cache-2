5000|$|After running away, Bender asks Elzar {{to teach}} him how to cook, but Elzar refuses. Bender then becomes a hobo and travels to the [...] "biggest hobo joint in the universe". There he meets Helmut Spargel, a legendary cook who lost his TV show when a young, {{upcoming}} Elzar replaced him. Spargel trains Bender how to cook in order to get revenge on Elzar. As a final test, Spargel challenges Bender to cook an <b>edible</b> <b>meal.</b> Spargel tries the food and tells Bender that it is [...] "acceptable". As a result of eating the food, his stomach explodes, and he dies. With his dying breath, Spargel reveals the secret to perfect cooking: a vial of unknown liquid ("the essence of pure flavour") to use whenever he needs to spice up a food.|$|E

These could both replace conventional ready meals and allow astronauts to enjoy a far more varied diet.|$|R

5000|$|In 1931, Henry Ford {{announced}} that soybeans were the new miracle crop. The seeds produced a healthful <b>edible</b> oil, a <b>meal</b> extremely high in protein, a residue high in fiber, were low in water, and they stored well. Soy made nationwide headlines at the Century of Progress Chicago World's Fair in 1934, and by 1935, 60 pounds of soybeans {{went into the}} paint and molded plastic parts of every Ford car.https://web.archive.org/web/20051216212140/http://thesoydailyclub.com:80/SFC/henryford74.asp ...|$|R
25|$|Berries and <b>edible</b> plants {{supplemented}} <b>meals</b> consisting {{mostly of}} fish and game. Plants foods also provided a variety of essential vitamins ans nutrients to the diet. Berries were preserved by freezing. The most popular use berries was when making akutaq, a whipped mixture of the berries, sugar, and shortening or fat. Households also made jam, jellies, and breads from berries. Sourdock leaves were prepared by boiling, like spinach. Labrador tea was boiled to make tea and was consumed much like commercial teas. Green spruce needles were also used for tea.|$|R
50|$|Burns, Philp {{was once}} {{involved}} in the production and distribution of food ingredients and consumer branded food, beverage and related products. The Group operated internationally, with leading products and brands enjoying significant market shares in each of its principal markets. Its product ranges included packaged bread and other baked goods, snack foods, breakfast cereals, <b>edible</b> oils, and <b>meal</b> components. One {{of the most significant}} subsidiaries of the business in terms of profit was Goodman Fielder, Australasia’s largest baker, which was floated in an IPO (initial public offering). In 2007 Burns, Philp sold its remaining 20% stake in Goodman Fielder for NZ$676m.|$|R
40|$|In the past, {{perennial}} and temperate-zone tree-form Hibiscus {{species and}} hybrids have {{been relegated to}} the status of little-known garden plants, at least in the United States. However, their potential as a new source of edible flowers and natural food colorants (all within the anthocyanin class of edible flower pigments) el-evates them to the status as—possibly the newest—of the New Crops. The 17 indigenous native Hibiscus species of North America range from USDA Zones 4 – 10 and, in the wild, are confined to wetland areas. In cultivation, the plants are installed in permanent plantations, using zero-runoff protocols under passive flooding, or drip irrigation protocols. Other hardy perennial and tree-form species from Asia, including H. mutabilis, H. syriacus, and the Pan-Pacific species H. hamabo and H. tileaceous are suitable for USDA Zones 8 – 10. Potential products from these cultivars include fresh food (primarily edible flowers for the restaurant trade) and natural food colorants, as well as <b>edible</b> seed <b>meals</b> and seed proteins (for nutraceutical applications), seed oils, lubricants, and fiber, mucilages and complex polysac-charides from fruiting organs, roots, canes, and/or branches. In this paper, the flowers of selected native North American, non-native Asiatic and pan-Pacific species and North American hybrid cultivars were selected for preliminary analysis of pigments. The 29 species and hybrid Malvaceae utilized for the chemical characterizations of the pigments in the fresh flowers are listed i...|$|R
40|$|Canola {{is a low}} {{erucic acid}} oilseed crop {{developed}} from oilseed rape, mainly used for <b>edible</b> oil and <b>meal</b> for feed • The United States imports the equivalent of 2 million acres of production each year • 1 million acres are planted to Canola in the United States with 90 % of the acreage being in the Dakotas and Minnesota. • With improvements to winter canola varieties 60, 000 acres were planted in 2006 in the southern Great Plains with the majority being centered in Oklahoma and Kansas. • Canola can potentially improve yield and quality of Oklahoma winter wheat planted after a canola rotation; limited research has shown a 15 % increase in winter wheat yields following canola. • Canola makes a good crop to rotate to to control troublesome weeds in wheat such as feral rye, jointed goatgrass, and rescuegrass. • Approximately 125 growers of canola in Oklahoma with about 80 - 160 acres each, totaling 16 - 17 thousand acres of canola...|$|R
30|$|Jatropha seeds {{contain a}} range of antinutritional {{compounds}} such as protease inhibitors (curcin), phytate, lectin, saponines and toxic compounds such as co-carcinogenic phorbol esters (PE) that render its oil and press cake inedible for humans and animals (He et al. 2011; Makkar et al. 1998; Devappa et al. 2012; Haas and Mittelbach 2000). Antinutritional compounds can be eliminated by heat treatment of the cake while PE are not destroyed by roasting (160  °C for 30  min) and migrate to the oil and cake (He et al. 2011; Kumar and Sharma 2008). This {{is the reason for}} the classification of toxic and non-toxic genotypes of Jatropha based on PE concentration in seeds (Devappa et al. 2012). Neutralization with NaOH and bleaching during refining reduce 40 – 60  % PE in crude oil, while degumming and deodorization have very little or no effect (Haas and Mittelbach 2000; Ahmed and Salimon 2009). Alkali and heat treatments have reduced 90  % PE content in whole and dehulled seed meal (Rakshit and Darukeshwara 2008). These reductions, while significant, are not enough to make Jatropha refined oil and <b>meal</b> <b>edible</b> (Goel et al. 2007).|$|R
