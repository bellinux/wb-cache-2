5|$|In 1938 for a dance {{composition}} titled Bacchanale, <b>John</b> <b>Cage</b> {{invented the}} prepared piano, producing both transformed pitches and colorful unpitched {{sounds from the}} piano.

5|$|Though {{little known}} at the time, Charles Ives's work of the 1910s {{established}} him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as Henry Cowell and <b>John</b> <b>Cage</b> created a distinctive American approach to classical composition.

5|$|Sonatas and Interludes is a {{collection}} of twenty pieces for prepared piano by American avant-garde composer <b>John</b> <b>Cage</b> (1912–1992). It was composed in 1946–48, shortly after Cage's introduction to Indian philosophy and the teachings of art historian Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, both of which became major influences on the composer's later work. Significantly more complex than his other works for prepared piano, Sonatas and Interludes is generally recognized as one of Cage's finest achievements.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the later}} 20th-century composers, such as <b>John</b> <b>Cage,</b> John Corigliano, and Steve Reich, Miguel del Aguila, used modernist and minimalist techniques. Reich {{discovered}} a technique known as phasing, in which two musical activities begin simultaneously and are repeated, gradually drifting out of sync, creating a natural sense of development. Reich was also very interested in non-Western music, incorporating African rhythmic techniques in his compositions. Recent composers and performers are strongly influenced by the minimalist works of Philip Glass, a Baltimore native based out of New York, Meredith Monk, and others.|$|E
5|$|The first {{industrial}} artists {{experimented with}} noise and aesthetically controversial topics, musically and visually, such as fascism, serial killers and the occult. Their production {{was not limited}} to music, but included mail art, performance art, installation pieces and other art forms. Prominent industrial musicians include Throbbing Gristle, Monte Cazazza, SPK, Boyd Rice, Cabaret Voltaire, and Z'EV. The precursors that influenced the development of the genre included acts such as electronic group Kraftwerk, experimental rock acts such as Pink Floyd and Frank Zappa, psychedelic rock artists such as Jimi Hendrix, and composers such as <b>John</b> <b>Cage.</b> Musicians also cite writers such as William S. Burroughs, and philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche as influences.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Ono's {{family moved}} without her to Scarsdale, New York, an {{affluent}} town 25 {{miles north of}} mid-town Manhattan. When she later rejoined her family in the U.S., she enrolled at nearby Sarah Lawrence College. While her parents approved of her college choice, Ono said that they disapproved of her lifestyle and chastised her for befriending people they felt were beneath her. In spite of her parents' disapproval, Ono loved meeting artists, poets, and others who represented the bohemian lifestyle to which she aspired. She visited galleries and art happenings in the city; this whetted her desire to publicly display her own artistic endeavors. American avant-garde artist, composer, and musician La Monte Young was her first important contact in the New York art world; he helped Ono start her career by using her Chambers Street loft in Tribeca as a performance space. After Ono set a painting on fire at one performance, her mentor <b>John</b> <b>Cage</b> advised her to treat the paper with flame retardant.|$|E

5|$|Crass {{have said}} that their musical {{influences}} were seldom drawn from rock, but more from classical music (particularly Benjamin Britten, on whose work, Rimbaud states, some of Crass' riffs are based), free jazz, European atonality and avant-garde composers such as <b>John</b> <b>Cage</b> and Karlheinz Stockhausen. Crass influenced the anarchist movement in the UK, the US and beyond. The growth of anarcho-punk spurred interest in anarchist ideas. The band have also claimed credit for revitalising the peace movement and the UK Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Others contend that they overestimated their influence, their radicalising effect on militants notwithstanding. Crass' philosophical and aesthetic influences on 1980s punk bands were far-reaching, although few mimicked their later free-form style (heard on Yes Sir, I Will and their final recording, Ten Notes on a Summer's Day). Their painted and collage black-and-white record sleeves (by Gee Vaucher) may have influenced later artists such as Banksy (with whom Vaucher collaborated) and the subvertising movement. Anti-folk artist Jeffrey Lewis's 2007 album, 12 Crass Songs, features acoustic covers of Crass material.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, Cowell's student Lou Harrison {{utilized}} keyboard clusters {{in several}} {{works such as}} his Prelude for Grandpiano (1937). At least {{as far back as}} 1942, <b>John</b> <b>Cage,</b> who also studied under Cowell, began writing piano pieces with cluster chords; In the Name of the Holocaust, from December of that year, includes chromatic, diatonic, and pentatonic clusters. Olivier Messiaen's Vingt regards sur l'enfant Jésus (1944), often described as the most important solo piano piece {{of the first half of}} the twentieth century, employs clusters throughout. They would feature in numerous subsequent piano works, by a range of composers. Karlheinz Stockhausen's Klavierstück X (1961) makes bold, rhetorical use of chromatic clusters, scaled in seven degrees of width, from three to thirty-six semitones, as well as ascending and descending cluster arpeggios and cluster glissandi. Written two decades later, his Klavierstück XIII employs many of the same techniques, along with clusters that call for the pianist to sit down on the keyboard. George Crumb's Apparitions, Elegiac Songs, and Vocalises for Soprano and Amplified Piano (1979), a setting of verse by Walt Whitman, is filled with clusters, including an enormous one that introduces three of its sections. The piano part of the second movement of Joseph Schwantner's song cycle Magabunda (1983) has perhaps the single largest chord ever written for an individual instrument: all 88 notes on the keyboard.|$|E
