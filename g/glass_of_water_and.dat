25|$|Like {{the rest}} of Mexico, Papantla celebrates Day of the Dead but has some local variations. “Ofrendas” (altars to the dead) {{can be set up}} on tables or on board which are {{suspended}} from the ceiling. The altar is called a pachau and the lack on one in the home can bring on social rejection for violating community norms. These are decorated with palm fronds, bananas, oranges, limes, anis and chocolate figures. Food stuffs include mole, candy, tamales, local breads and other regional specialties. A <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> “renio” (a type of local alcohol) are also placed. Day of the Dead celebrations begin on 31 October for those who had died of natural causes. On 1 November, the souls of deceased children (called Laqsq’at’an) are welcomed. Later on 1 November and 2 November the souls of adults are said to return. It is believed that the souls {{come in the form of}} insects to eat the meals laid out in offering. It is also believed that this food needs to be freshly prepared and hot. During the nights, groups of living children go house to house singing traditional songs.|$|E
25|$|As the {{questioning}} continues, Ingrid admits to Emma {{that she wants}} her {{to be part of}} her family, but then uses mind tactics on Emma to convince her that her family do not love her, they fear her. Emma denies this, but as she pauses for a second, Ingrid casts a spell on a <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> when she returns Ingrid increases the pressure on Emma, resulting in the glass of water to boil as Emma's powers are unleashed due to her fear, causing the wall in the station to blast open and Ingrid to escape. Emma then walks out and as David, Mary Margaret, Hook, Elsa, Gold, and Belle show up to stop her, Emma wants everyone to stay away but when Hook touches her, Emma causes the streetlight to fall on David. Emma runs away after a horrified Mary Margret looks at her with disgust and gets into her car driving away even as Mary Margret calls after her that it's okay. Everyone present suspects that The Snow Queen/Ingrid has succeeded in turning Emma against them. After Elsa and Hook are unable to find Emma, Mary Margret blames herself, stating that no one wants their family to see them as a monster. Elsa reassures a fearful Hook that Emma will be fine, but that she needs time alone {{to come to terms with}} her powers, the way she did. Meanwhile, a terrified Emma sits in her parked bug in the woods overlooking the town.|$|E

500|$|Tot Mitică offers other glimpses {{into the}} character's {{financial}} problems, showing him complaining {{that he has}} been [...] "pulling the devil's tail"—using a traditional proverb to indicate that he has had a hard time getting by. To this, he adds that the devil would be suing him for injuries. He claims {{that he is going to}} spend his vacation in the mountains, and elaborates that he is talking about the pawnbroking institution known as muntele de pietate (from the French for [...] "Mountain of Piety"; see Mont de Piété). Mitică enters a restaurant to order only things which he knows are free ("a toothpick, a match, a <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> a newspaper").

2500|$|At 21:04 (UTC+3), on 8 June 2016, two {{perpetrators}} {{dressed in}} suits and ties {{arrived at the}} Max Brenner Cafe in the Sarona Market complex near HaArba'a Street in Tel Aviv. They inspected the area and then sat down on chairs outside, ordering desserts. At 21:27 the perpetrators stood up and fired at the diners until one of the perpetrators' firearms jammed. He slammed the firearm {{on the floor and}} the perpetrators started to run away from the site. The perpetrators wounded 11 people. Four were critically wounded, and later succumbed to their wounds. Two others were in severe condition, two in moderate condition and four in light condition. An additional 14 people suffering from symptoms of anxiety received medical attention at the scene and at the hospitals. The two did not have an escape plan, an official of the Israel Security Agency said, after investigation, that they [...] "trusted in Allah". The perpetrators fled and split up, and at 21:40, one of the perpetrators was wounded and neutralized after a gunfight with a civil guard of Kol Yisrael and was taken to Ichilov Hospital in serious condition. The other unarmed perpetrator ran in a nearby street, near the Tel Aviv Cinematheque. He encountered an off-duty policeman (who was in plainclothes) and asked him for a <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> the unsuspecting policeman invited him into his home with his family. The man then rushed {{to the scene of the}} attack, leaving the perpetrator in his home. The family tried to speak to the perpetrator but he didn't respond and was stressed. The wife of the policeman said she didn't suspect anything and that she thought he was a man who ran from the attack. When the policeman saw the other perpetrator was dressed just like the man he invited into his home, he rushed back to his home and captured the perpetrator who tried to escape. While arresting him, one of the policemen called in to help entered the home with his weapon drawn. When he saw that the perpetrator was already captured, he returned his weapon to its sheath, at which point it discharged a bullet and one of the policemen was wounded from shrapnel.|$|E
50|$|Briskly. A murky, dissonant piece. An octopus in its {{underwater}} cave teases a crab before swallowing it sideways. This {{gives the}} octopus severe indigestion. It drinks a <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> salt <b>water</b> <b>and</b> feels better.|$|R
6000|$|At last Mr. Furnival {{succeeded in}} hunting up Mr. Round, {{and found him}} {{recruiting}} outraged nature with a <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> brandy <b>and</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> a cigar.

50|$|The Loser (Sergey Gladkov) — {{a clumsy}} man with glasses who always lacks money.

5000|$|The {{members of}} De La Soul {{sit in a}} high school {{guidance}} counselor's office, lamenting that they have to take a class taught by Professor Defbeat. Prince Paul briefly interrupts the scene to make a statement: [...] "If you take three <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> put food coloring in them, you have many different colors, but it's still the same old water." [...] Trugoy, Posdnuos and Maseo arrive for Defbeat's class, in which he teaches the image-driven, mainstream style of hip-hop. Throughout the video, Posdnuos, Maceo, and Trugoy are teased by their fellow students and punished by Defbeat for sporting a unique style instead of conforming to the more popular hip-hop image. Defbeat and the other students are dressed in the stereotypical rap gear: clunky gold medallions and jewelry, sunglasses, leather jackets, expensive sneakers, jogging suits, and baseball caps worn backwards.|$|R

60|$|Anneke was {{certainly}} well frightened by this adventure with the lion, as was apparent by her changing colour, {{and a few}} tears that succeeded.

60|$|On Wednesday evening Dave partook rather freely of some hash {{that was}} served up.
