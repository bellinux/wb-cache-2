40|$|A chatbot is a {{software}} system, which can interact or “chat ” {{with a human}} user in natural language such as English. For the annual Loebner Prize contest, rival chatbots have been assessed in terms of ability to fool a judge <b>in</b> a <b>restricted</b> chat <b>session.</b> We are investigating methods to train and adapt a chatbot to a specific user’s language use or application, via a usersupplied training corpus. We advocate open-ended trials by real users, such as an example Afrikaans chatbot for Afrikaansspeaking researchers and students in South Africa. This is evaluated in terms of “glass box ” dialogue efficiency metrics, and “black box ” dialogue quality metrics and user satisfaction feedback. The other examples {{presented in this paper}} are the Qur'an and the FAQchat prototypes. Our general conclusion is that evaluation should be adapted to the application and to user needs. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} a graphical representation of session invocation interdependency {{in order to}} prove progress for the pi-calculus with sessions under the usual session typing discipline. We show that those processes whose associated dependency graph is acyclic can be brought to reduce. We call such processes transparent processes. Additionally, we prove that for well-typed processes where services contain no free names, such acyclicity is preserved by the reduction semantics. Our results encompass programs (processes containing neither free nor <b>restricted</b> <b>session</b> chan-nels) and higher-order sessions (delegation). Furthermore, we give examples suggesting that trans-parent processes constitute a large enough class of processes with progress to have applications in modern session-based programming languages for web services. ...|$|R
