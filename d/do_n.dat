40|$|OBJECTIVES: The human bladder shows {{spontaneous}} autonomous activity. Detrusor overactivity {{could be}} seen as a consequence of exaggerated autonomous activity. Interstitial cells (ICs) play a potential role in coordination of autonomous activity. As it is suggested that changes in ICs coexist with detrusor overactivity (DO), we investigated possible alterations to human bladder ICs. METHODS: Biopsies were obtained from 23 patients and were categorized into four groups: genuine stress incontinence (without <b>DO)</b> (<b>n</b> = 5), neurogenic disease with <b>DO</b> (<b>n</b> = 6), bladder outlet obstruction with <b>DO</b> (<b>n</b> = 6), or idiopathic <b>DO</b> (<b>n</b> = 6). Specimens were processed to investigate expression of N-cadherin and PGP 9. 5. N-cadherin expression was semiquantitatively analyzed and correlated to PG 9. 5 expression and bladder wall morphology. RESULTS: The population of cells expressing N-cadherin is altered in the overactive detrusor, making no difference between the sources of DO. Punctate distribution of morphological changes was found and downregulation of PGP 9. 5 expression seemed to coexist with upregulation of N-cadherin expression in the detrusor layer. CONCLUSIONS: The population of N-cadherin+ cells of the interstitial compartment of the human bladder has the ability to proliferate. As this proliferation seems to coexist with denervation, it could be possible that a highly developed network of interstitial cells replaces the loss of innervation in overactive detrusor...|$|E

Samples collected from 0 - 0. 2 m layer of 15 soils from rice paddy fields in the RS state were used for the mineralization experiment. Flooded rice plants were grown for 60 days in pots containing four kg of each soil. The N mineralization was evaluated in a laboratory experiment, in anaerobic conditions for 24 weeks. The content of soil organic C was highly associated to the N absorbed by the plants (r= 0. 90; P< 0. 01), as well as to the mineralized N (r= 0. 91; P< 0. 01) and to the content of N absorbed by the plants (r= 0. 92; P< 0. 01). The N 0 values for the fifteen soils varied from 107. 70 to 207. 64 mg kg- 1 and they were higher for observed mineralized N (98. 3 to 191. 3 mg kg- 1 of soil). The mineralization rate constant varied from 0. 1492 to 0. 2438 week- 1, and the mineralization speed was higher at initial period, until the fourth week of incubation. It was verified a close relationship between the N absorbed by rice plants and the nitrogen mineralization potential and with the content of soil organic C.

O presente trabalho objetivou estimar o destino <b>do</b> <b>N</b> em videiras produtivas quando aplicado na época do inchamento das gemas. O experimento foi conduzido na safra 2002 - 2003 em um vinhedo de viníferas, cvs. Chardonnay e Riesling Renano, na Embrapa Uva e Vinho, em Bento Gonçalves - RS, sobre um Neossolo Litólico. As videiras receberam a aplicação de 15, 91 g N planta- 1 no inchamento das gemas, correspondendo a 40 kg N ha- 1, enriquecido com 4 % de átomos 15 N em excesso. Foram coletadas gemas brotadas e folhas na parte central do ramo emitido no ano, em oito épocas na cv. Chardonnay e sete épocas na cv. Riesling Renano. Na última coleta das folhas, as videiras foram cortadas e separadas em cachos, folhas, ramos do ano, ramos dos anos anteriores e caule. Foram secadas, determinada a produção de matéria seca e os teores de N total e 15 N. Os resultados mostraram que a maior porcentagem de N nas folhas das videiras, cvs. Chardonnay e Riesling Renano, na brotação até a colheita da uva, é derivada de formas diferentes de N aplicado no inchamento das gemas. Na colheita da uva, a maior quantidade <b>do</b> <b>N</b> acumulado nas partes anuais e perenes das videiras é derivada <b>do</b> <b>N</b> do solo, sendo muito pequenas as quantidades de N aplicado no inchamento das gemas armazenado nas partes perenes.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate nitrogen utilization by sugarcane ratoon from two sources, applied urea and sugarcane straw covering soil surface (trash blanket), besides the recovery of N from both sources in the soil-plant system. The following treatments were established in a randomized block design with four replicates: T 1, vinasse-urea (100 kg ha- 1 of urea-N) mixture applied on the total area of the soil covered with cane trash labeled with 15 N; T 2, vinasse-urea mixture (urea labeled with 15 N; 100 kg ha- 1 of urea-N) applied on the total area of the soil covered with non-labeled sugarcane trash; and T 3, urea- 15 N (100 kg ha- 1 of urea-N) applied in furrows at both sides of cane rows, with previous surface application of vinasse, onto soil without trash covering. The vinasse was applied at a rate of 100 m³ ha- 1 in all treatments. The experiment was carried out on a Yellow Red Podzolic soil (Paleudalf), from October 1997 to August 1998, in Piracicaba, SP, Brazil. The nitrogen use efficiency of urea by the sugarcane ratoon was 21 %, while that of the sugarcane straw was 9 %. The main contributions of N from sugarcane trash, during one cycle, are the preservation and increase of the organic N in soil. The tendency for a lower accumulation of urea-N in the sugarcane plant, in the soil surface covered with sugarcane residue, was compensated by the assimilation of N from trash mineralization.
