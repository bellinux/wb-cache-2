50|$|In {{their study}} on <b>Dickcissels</b> and crop damage in Venezuela, Basili and Temple (1999), {{found that the}} {{population}} of <b>Dickcissels</b> declined by 40% between the years of 1960 and 1980. The declines were primarily due to direct killings by humans. <b>Dickcissels</b> migrate to Venezuela in winter {{and they tend to}} gather in large colonies (millions of birds) to feed and sleep. Farmers in Venezuela thought that <b>Dickcissels</b> were pests that fed on rice and cereal crops, so they aerially sprayed the region with pesticides to kill of the birds. The <b>dickcissels</b> consumed only 0.37-0.745% of the grains produced.

40|$|In Venezuela, lethal {{control of}} {{wintering}} <b>Dickcissels</b> (Spiza americana) {{is considered a}} threat to the species survival. To help farmers protect their rice and sorghum crops from depredations by <b>Dickcissels</b> and to minimize the killing of large numbers of these birds, alternative non-lethal crop protection measures are needed. To that end, the responses of captive <b>Dickcissels</b> to three bird-repellent chemicals applied to rice seed were evaluated. In one-cup feeding trials, treatments of methiocarb (0. 05 % g g- 1, applied as Mesurol® 75 % wettable powder) and anthraquinone (0. 5 %, applied as Flight Control®) reduced consumption of rice by 70 % relative to pretreatment consumption. Other anthraquinone treatments (0. 05, 0. 1 %) and methyl anthranilate (0. 05 %) were ineffective. In two-cup trials, with untreated millet as the alternative food, consumption of rice treated with 0. 05 and 0. 1 % anthraquinone was reduced by 90 % relative to pretreatment levels. Overall, <b>Dickcissels</b> responded to the repellents similarly to the red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus). Because Flight Control® has been used successfully to reduce blackbird use of rice fields in the USA, the prospect is good for successful reduction of damage to ripening rice by <b>Dickcissels</b> in Venezuela, particularly if repellent use is coupled with the establishment of alternative feeding sites...|$|R

Current grassland management paradigms focus on addressing nesting requirements for grassland birds, but ignore post-fledging requirements. I described resource selection, movement patterns, and survival of <b>dickcissels</b> (Spiza americana) and eastern meadowlarks (Sturnella magna) in southwestern Missouri, from 2002 to 2004 using radio telemetry. Across species at the micro-scale, there was support for the predation hypothesis (both species) and the thermal refuge hypothesis (<b>dickcissels</b> only). Woody cover (both species) and vegetation height (meadowlarks) had the highest relative importance across years. At the landscape scale, uniformly shrubby prairies, longer distances to forests, roads, and grazing were negatively associated with juvenile <b>dickcissels.</b> Crops, pastures, increasing distances to ponds and streams were positively associated with juvenile meadowlarks. Core home range sizes (50 %) were similar across species, but 95 % home ranges were 25 % larger for meadowlarks (80. 9 ± 13. 9 ha) than <b>dickcissels</b> (51. 2 ± 8. 8 ha). Home range patterns were mostly non-linear and categorized as central or exploratory. Across years, biological factors (number of siblings, order of fledging) were the best predictors of home range size. Survival was higher and the instantaneous probability of death declined faster for meadowlarks compared to <b>dickcissels.</b> My results indicate that our working concepts of suitable breeding habitat need to be modified to accommodate post-fledging requirements and maximize the effectiveness of conservation strategies...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>dickcissel</b> {{is part of}} a {{group of}} Cardinalidae that {{apparently}} also includes Amaurospiza, Cyanocompsa, Cyanoloxia and Passerina. Spiza is the only one among these that lacks blue structural colors in its plumage. The scientific name means simply [...] "American finch"; spiza is the Ancient Greek catch-all term for finch-like birds. Many bird genera contain the term spiza, but none of these were generally held to be a really close relative of Spiza itself. Amusingly, Amaurospiza seems to have turned out to be one of the closest living relatives of the <b>dickcissel</b> after all.|$|E
50|$|Though {{the color}} pattern and {{habits of the}} <b>dickcissel</b> make it stand apart from other Cardinalidae, its robust {{cone-shaped}} bill - stouter than in American sparrows or true finches which it somewhat resembles at first glance - gives away its relationships.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dickcissel</b> populations {{frequently}} fluctuate in numbers, even to {{the extent}} that their range changes notably. In the early 19th century, dickcissels expanded eastward, establishing a population in New England and the mid-Atlantic states that disappeared around the end of the century. Both appearance and disappearance were probably related to changes in land use.|$|E
50|$|Mammals of this {{ecoregion}} include bison (Bison bison bison), {{mule deer}} (Odocoileus hemonius) and coyote (Canis latrans).

50|$|The <b>dickcissel</b> (Spiza americana) {{is a small}} American {{seed-eating}} bird in {{the family}} Cardinalidae.

50|$|No {{specific}} details are {{known about the}} <b>dickcissel's</b> lipochrome metabolism; {{it may be that}} it happens to be more fine-tuned than in other birds, so that most mutations therein will be lethal and Audubon's bird was simply {{one of the very few}} individuals that survived. It stands to note that in wild birds, varying from species to species some color aberrations are less frequently seen than others, and that in captive birds such as canaries, some color mutations have only arisen a handful of times at most during several centuries of dedicated breeding and screening for novel color variants (see also Budgerigar colour genetics). While only a complete molecular biological study of the <b>dickcissel's</b> metabolism and the specimen's ancient DNA stands any reasonable chance to resolve the question with certainty, the hypothesis of an extremely uncommon color mutation is plausible, and such phenomena certainly occur in other Passeroidea.|$|R

The habitat changes facilitated by cattle grazing can influence resource availability and habitat selection for associated wildlife.

5000|$|Actually, {{they are}} part of the tanager-cardinal lineage. The AOU moved this genus into the Cardinalidae family in 2008.

If that is correct, the <b>dickcissel</b> in the genus Spiza would, quite amusingly, indeed turn out to be one of their closest living relatives.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, {{the bird}} was {{considered}} a hybrid, but {{the present state of}} knowledge of the dickcissel's relations makes this not very plausible - {{there are a number of}} species with which Spiza could conceivably produce hybrids - such as Passerina -, but the lack of even the slightest hint of blue structural colors in Townsend's specimen and it moreover being not different from a <b>dickcissel</b> in habitus makes the hybrid theory suspect. Regardless, Townsend noted observed the bird making vocalizations reminiscent more of an indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea), and by comparing mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences of the specimen with those of the <b>dickcissel,</b> the indigo bunting, and perhaps other Passerina, the hybridization hypothesis should be far more easy to prove or reject than a color aberration. On the other hand, there is not enough known on whether dickcissels pick up their characteristic vocalizations from conspecific males or whether they are innate, and thus no firm conclusion regarding Townsend's observations has been made.|$|E

40|$|Conservationists and {{managers}} mention grassland restorations as a conservation strategy {{to reverse the}} decline of grassland bird populations in the Great Plains. In the Rainwater Basin Region of southcentral Nebraska, state and federal resource agencies have used grassland restorations to protect wetlands from sedimentation and agrichemical runoff. These grassland restorations may also provide important habitat for breeding grassland birds. In this paper, we describe the abundance, composition, nesting success, and habitat requirements of breeding birds in grassland restorations in the Rainwater Basin Region. We observed 14 grassland bird species in 12 grassland restorations. The most abundant species were <b>dickcissels</b> (Spiza americana), grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum), and bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus). We found a total of 84 nests composed of II species in restorations. <b>Dickcissels</b> and grasshopper sparrows accounted for 77 % of all nests found. Nest success was 31 % (26 nests), and the major cause of nest loss was predation, which accounted for 66 % (38 nests) of all nest failures. The occurrence of 10 of the species in grassland restorations was influenced {{by a variety of}} vegetation variables. Grassland bird species have benefited from grassland restorations in the Rainwater Basin Region.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of BiologyBrett K. SandercockGrassland {{birds are}} declining {{throughout}} their native range. The Flint Hills of eastern Kansas and Oklahoma contain {{large tracts of}} tallgrass prairie, but intensification of agricultural practices may be contributing to ongoing population declines. Common rangeland management practices include annual burning coupled with heavy grazing by cattle. This system, known as intensive early stocking and burning, promotes homogeneous utilization of forage by cattle but may not provide habitat for some grassland bird species. Patch-burn grazing is an alternative management system that aims to restore heterogeneity on rangelands by recreating the fire-grazing interaction that would have historically occurred throughout the Great Plains. From 2011 - 2013, we examined responses of grassland birds to traditional rangeland management and patch-burn grazing by conducting vegetation surveys, line transect surveys, and nest monitoring on privately-owned pastures in Chase County and Greenwood County, Kansas. Vegetative heterogeneity was higher on patch-burned pastures, with unburned patches having higher visual obstruction and less bare ground. Densities of grassland birds differed by species and among habitat strata. Unburned patches on patch-burned pastures were associated with increased densities of <b>Dickcissels</b> (Spiza americana), Eastern Meadowlarks (Sturnella magna) and Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum). Henslow’s Sparrows (A. henslowii) were only detected on patch-burned pastures. Nest survival of grassland songbirds was similar among management systems but varied by year. Probability of nest parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) varied among years and between treatments for <b>Dickcissels</b> and Grasshopper Sparrows, with overall lower rates on burned areas and during drought years. For <b>Dickcissels</b> and Grasshopper Sparrows, {{there was a significant}} reduction in host clutch size between parasitized versus unparasitized nests. Overall, nest survival of grassland songbirds in managed rangelands was low. Patch-burn grazing improved rangeland conditions and provided habitat for more species of birds, but did not increase nest survival. Drought conditions in 2012 and 2013 may have influenced the results of this study, as many landowners were unable to burn as planned. Further study is needed to determine underlying factors driving variation in nest success and parasitism rates for grassland birds, particularly on private lands which make up the vast majority of remnant tallgrass prairies...|$|R
5000|$|In 1760, Brisson {{published}} the following description {{based on a}} captive bird (which {{may have been the}} specimen now preserved in Paris): Upperparts of head and neck clear (ash) grey. Back, rump, underparts of neck, breast, belly, sides, legs, scapular feathers, uppercoverts of tail very-dark (ash) grey. Wing feathers of the same colour. The tail is composed of 12 feathers: the two median ones are also very-dark (ash) grey. All the lateral ones are of the same colour, except that they have a little white at their base. The eyes are surrounded by a naked skin, bright red. Pupil black, iris red. The base of the superior half of the beak is also surrounded by a red naked skin in which the nostrils are placed. Beak similarly red. Legs pale flesh. Claws grey-brown. I am unaware from which country it is found. I have seen it living in Paris. Instead of grey, several later authors described the body as brown and the head as bluish lilac, based on stuffed specimens, and this has become the orthodox image of the bird. Live birds were never described with these colours. Hume has proposed that this colouration is an artifact of the taxidermy specimens having aged and being exposed to light, which can turn grey and black to brown. Such a transformation has also turned an aberrant <b>dickcissel</b> (Spiza americana) specimen (sometimes considered a distinct species, [...] "Townsend's dickcissel"), from grey to brown. The two extant Mascarene parrot specimens also differ from each other in colouration. The Paris specimen has a greyish-blue head, and a brown body, paler on the underparts. Its tail and wing feathers were severely damaged by sulphuric acid in an attempt at fumigation in the 1790s. The Vienna specimen is a pale brown on the head and body overall, with an irregular distribution of white feathers on the tail, back, and wings. Confusion over the colouration of the Mascarene parrot has also been furthered by a plate by French engraver and naturalist François-Nicolas Martinet in Buffon's 1779 Histoire Naturelle Des Oiseaux, the first coloured illustration of this species. It shows the bird as brown with a purplish head, and the strength of these colours differs considerably between copies, a result of having been hand-coloured by many different artists who worked under Martinet in his workshop. Across these copies, the body ranges from chestnut brown to greyish chocolate, the tail from light grey to blackish grey-brown, and the head from bluish grey to dove-grey. The plate also lacks two dark central tail feathers without white bases, a feature described by Brisson, and these features have been repeated by subsequent artists. Martinet's illustration and Buffon's description were perhaps based on the Paris specimen.|$|E
40|$|Males of {{polygynous}} {{bird species}} typically provide less parental care to their offspring than males of monogamous species (Ketterson and Nolan 1994). Generally, in polygynous species, a male forfeits some potential reproductive success ifhe shifts his reproductive effort from mating with multiple females to parental care (Trivers 1972, Gubemick et al. 1993, Schleicher et al. 1993).
