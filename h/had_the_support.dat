5|$|Following {{his term}} in the Senate, Beckham resumed his legal {{practice}} in Louisville. He sought another term as governor in 1927. This time he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> of the Louisville Courier-Journal, which had been purchased by his ally, Robert W. Bingham. He was opposed by a powerful political machine known as the Jockey Club, whose main interest was securing legislation to allow parimutuel betting at the state's horse racetracks.|$|E

5|$|Green, however, <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> of Bernard G.

5|$|In 1960, Democrats {{nominated}} {{former governor}} Keen Johnson, then {{an executive with}} Reynolds Metals, to oppose Cooper's re-election bid. Cooper <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> of organized labor and benefitted from {{a large segment of}} Kentuckians who voted for Republican Richard M. Nixon over Democrat John F. Kennedy as a reaction against Kennedy's Catholicism in the 1960 presidential election. Cooper ultimately defeated Johnson by 199,257 votes, a record victory margin for a Kentucky senatorial candidate.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Ivan Shishman {{was engaged}} in a war against the voivode of Wallachia, Dan I, between 1384 and 1386. There are few details about that war, only a brief note in the Anonymous Bulgarian Chronicle that Dan I died 23 September 1386 after being poisoned. The war {{was linked to the}} {{hostilities}} between Ivan Shishman and Ivan Sratsimir (Dan I's uncle), who <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> of the Wallachian rulers and was married to Anna of the House of Basarab.|$|E

5|$|Kubah was {{inspired}} by Indonesian history, beginning in the 1940s and continuing until the 1980s. Following the national revolution from 1945 to 1949, the country was set {{in a state of}} political turmoil and abject poverty which became increasingly severe {{towards the end of the}} 1950s. By the early 1960s the PKI and other leftist parties <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> of President Sukarno, giving them greater power; PKI membership grew quickly in this period, aided by a hyperinflation and widespread poverty.|$|E
5|$|Once Barroso {{put forward}} the {{candidates}} {{for his next}} Commission, another opportunity to gain concessions arose. Bulgarian nominee Rumiana Jeleva was forced to step down by Parliament due to concerns over her experience and financial interests. She only <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> of the EPP which began to retaliate on left wing candidates before Jeleva gave in and was replaced (setting back the final vote further).|$|E
5|$|Pietro Vidoni <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> {{of members}} of the Flying Squadron as well as Christina of Sweden and her ally Azzolino.

5|$|Victoria became second-in-line to the British throne in 1827; {{to prevent}} Victoria from being {{surrounded}} by commoners, King George IV named Lehzen a Baroness of the Kingdom of Hanover later that year. Lehzen encouraged the princess to become strong, informed, and independent from the Duchess and Conroy's influence, causing friction between the two and Lehzen. Attempts to remove the governess, who <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> of Victoria's uncles George IV, William IV, and Leopold I of Belgium, were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|By {{contrast}} with the tensions in England, in Normandy Henry had occasional disagreements with the Church but generally enjoyed very {{good relations with the}} Norman bishops. In Brittany, Henry <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> of the local church hierarchy and rarely intervened in clerical matters, except occasionally in order to cause difficulties for his rival Louis of France. Further south, however, the power of the dukes of Aquitaine over the local church was much less than in the north, and Henry's efforts to extend his influence over local appointments created tensions. During the disputed papal election of 1159, Henry, like Louis, supported Alexander III over his rival Victor IV.|$|E
5|$|Command, control, and {{coordination}} {{of the operation}} {{was going to be}} problematic, especially in the highly politicized South Vietnamese command structure, where the support of key political figures was of paramount importance in promotion to and retention of command positions. Lieutenant General Lê Nguyên Khang, the Vietnamese Marine Corps commander and protege of Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky, whose troops were scheduled to participate in the operation, actually outranked General Lãm, who <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> of President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. The same situation applied to Lieutenant General Dư Quốc Đống, commander of ARVN Airborne forces also scheduled to participate in the operation. After the incursion began, both men remained in Saigon and delegated their command authority to junior officers rather than take orders from Lãm. This did not bode well for the success of the operation.|$|E

5|$|During the Spanish Civil War, several {{countries}} followed {{a principle of}} non-intervention, to avoid any potential escalation and possible expansion of the war to other nations, which {{would result in the}} signing of the Non-Intervention Agreement in August 1936 and the setting up of the Non-Intervention Committee, which first met in September. Primarily arranged by the French and British governments, important members of the committee also included the Soviet Union, Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Ultimately, the committee <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> of 27 nations.|$|E
5|$|Ernest <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> of the {{previous}} Elector, now Salentin IX of Isenburg-Grenzau, Frederick, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg, and, probably most important, several thousand Spanish troops hired by the pope. While representatives from the Cathedral chapter, the seven imperial electors, the emperor, and the pope tried to resolve differences around the negotiating table, first in Frankfurt am Main, and then in Muhlhausen in Westphalia, the armies of both sides rampaged throughout the southern portion of the Electorate, called the Oberstift, plundering abbeys and convents, burning villages and small cities, and destroying crops, bridges, and roads. None of the combatants were prepared to commit their troops in a fixed battle; it was far more lucrative, and safer as well, to use them {{in a show of}} force, intimidating the peasantry, besieging walled towns and small cities, and limiting trade and the sale of food-stuffs in the marketplaces.|$|E
5|$|Estañol's views {{represented}} {{those of}} {{the portion of the}} upper class which was willing {{to come to terms with}} at least a portion of the middle class in order to crush the peasant uprisings, as exemplified by those of Zapata, which were erupting throughout Mexico. Limantour, who broadly agreed with Estañol, <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> of the Mexican financiers, who feared the downgrading of Mexican international credit and a general economic crisis as a result of ongoing social unrest, as well as that of the large landowners who were willing to come to terms with Madero if it would put an end to the agrarian uprisings.|$|E

5|$|If the {{election}} {{had been left}} to the papacy, Ernst {{would have been the}} choice, but the Pope was {{not a member of the}} Cathedral Chapter and Gebhard <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> of several of the Catholic, and all the Protestant, canons in the Chapter. In December 1577, he was chosen Elector and Archbishop of Cologne after a spirited contest with the papacy's candidate, Ernst: Gebhard won {{the election}} by two votes. Although it was not required of him, Gebhard agreed to undergo priestly ordination; he was duly consecrated in March 1578, and swore to uphold the Council of Trent's decrees.|$|E
5|$|In 1808, when Congressman Benjamin Parke {{resigned}} from office, Harrison ordered {{a special election}} to fill the vacancy. Jennings entered the race against Harrison's candidate, Thomas Randolph, the attorney general for the territory, and John Johnson, a Vincennes native who <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> of the antislavery group. Randolph promised not to introduce slavery into the territory unless {{the majority of his}} constituents agreed, while Johnson remained silent on the issue. Jennings, an antislavery candidate from the eastern portion of the territory, rode from settlement to settlement to give speeches against slavery. Jennings spoke against what he believed to be Randolph's aristocratic tendencies, ties to Harrison's territorial government, and the issue of slavery in the territory. Jennings found his greatest support among the growing Quaker community {{in the eastern part of}} the territory.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Johnson, {{as leader}} of the Women's Suffrage Movement, and Eugenia Lockhart, the organization's secretary, went to London to plead the case for suffrage. They met with the London branch of the International Alliance of Women to discuss the {{situation}} in the Bahamas, claiming that though they <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> of the majority of Bahamian women, many women could not voice their approval because they were employed by merchants and the government who were opposed to the cause. They also sought an audience at the Colonial Office to air their grievances, accompanied by the chairman of the PLP, Henry Milton Taylor. They met with the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Iain Macleod, and two women British Parliamentarians, Baroness Joan Vickers and Baroness Eirene White. The Bahamians were assured that their case was accepted and that change would soon follow. They returned, but no change was forthcoming.|$|E
