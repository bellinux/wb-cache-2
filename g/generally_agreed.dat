5|$|According to Nielsen ratings, {{the episode}} drew just over 24million viewers, {{indicating}} a 4million viewer decrease {{from the previous}} season premiere a year earlier. The episode received mostly positive reviews. Critics complimented the six-month time jump and <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> that the episode showed improvement over {{the quality of the}} second season.|$|E
5|$|After {{settling}} at Glen Noe, {{the chiefs}} {{are said to}} have held the land for centuries. While presumably owning the property outright originally, it is <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> that at some, uncertain date, they acquired a feudal obligation to the Campbells of Breadalbane. Initially, this entailed only a symbolic payment. Tradition identifies this as a snowball supplied at midsummer and a white calf surrendered but then killed and shared by landlord and tenant as a token of mutual esteem.|$|E
5|$|All {{witnesses}} <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> {{that the}} first two shots were almost indistinguishable from each other. General firing immediately broke out. Virgil and Wyatt thought Tom was armed. When shooting started, the horse that Tom McLaury held jumped to one side. Wyatt said he also saw Tom throw {{his hand to his}} right hip. Virgil said Tom followed the horse's movement, hiding behind it, and fired once or twice over the horse's back.|$|E

5|$|Although it is <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> {{that the}} aye-aye {{is the most}} basal member of the lemur clade, the {{relationship}} between the other four families is less clear since they diverged during a narrow 10 to 12million-year window between the Late Eocene (42mya) and into the Oligocene (30mya). Although all studies place Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae as a sister clade to Indriidae and Lemuridae, some suggest that Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae diverged first, while others suggest that Indriidae and Lemuridae were the first to branch off.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} remaster was mostly positive. Several critics {{noted that some}} features like the inventory system and the insistence on having to revisit previously explored areas have not aged very well, but <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> that the remaster was a solid revival of a classic. The new control scheme was also considered more intuitive and satisfying, especially for new players.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, P.semilanceata has a {{widespread}} distribution, and {{is found in}} Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Channel Islands, Czech republic, Denmark, Estonia, the Faroe Islands, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. It is <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> that the species is native to Europe; Watling has demonstrated that there exists little difference between specimens collected from Spain and Scotland, at both the morphological and genetic level.|$|E

5|$|It is <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> {{that the}} Chelicerata contain the classes Arachnida (spiders, scorpions, mites, etc.), Xiphosura (horseshoe crabs) and Eurypterida (sea scorpions, extinct). The extinct Chasmataspida {{may be a}} {{sub-group}} within Eurypterida. The Pycnogonida (sea spiders) were traditionally classified as chelicerates, but some features suggest they may be representatives of the earliest arthropods from which the well-known groups such as chelicerates evolved.|$|E
5|$|Long-term field {{research}} has shown that range size, group size, social systems, and territorial behavior vary widely, and may be greatly affected by food distribution and quality. It is <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> that the ruffed lemur social system is multi-male/multi-female with a fission-fusion society, although some populations of black-and-white ruffed lemur have been reported as monogamous. This social flexibility is suspected to improve survivability despite an inflexible feeding ecology.|$|E
5|$|Other {{molecular}} phylogenetics analyses {{agree the}} redefined Platyhelminthes are most {{closely related to}} Gastrotricha, and both {{are part of a}} grouping known as Platyzoa. Platyzoa are <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> to be at least closely related to the Lophotrochozoa, a superphylum that includes molluscs and annelid worms. The majority view is that Platyzoa are part of Lophotrochozoa, but a significant minority of researchers regard Platyzoa as a sister group of Lophotrochozoa.|$|E

5|$|The Platyhelminthes {{excluding}} Acoelomorpha contain {{two main}} groups, Catenulida and Rhabditophora, {{both of which}} are <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> to be monophyletic (each contains all and only the descendants of an ancestor that {{is a member of the}} same group). Early molecular phylogenetics analyses of the Catenulida and Rhabditophora left uncertainties about whether these could be combined in a single monophyletic group, but a study in 2008 concluded they could, therefore Platyhelminthes could be redefined as Catenulida plus Rhabditophora, excluding the Acoelomorpha.|$|E
5|$|The ancestral {{function}} of the RNAi system is <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> to have been immune defense against exogenous genetic elements such as transposons and viral genomes. Related functions such as histone modification may have already been present in the ancestor of modern eukaryotes, although other functions such as regulation of development by miRNA {{are thought to have}} evolved later.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{introductions of}} A. altissima to countries outside of its native range {{were to the}} southern areas of Korea {{as well as to}} Japan. It is possible that the tree is native to these areas, but it is <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> that the tree was a very early introduction. Within China itself it has also been naturalised beyond its native range in areas such as Qinghai, Ningxia and Xinjiang.|$|E

5|$|Warwick's {{historical}} legacy {{has been a}} matter of much dispute. Historical opinion has alternated between seeing him as self-centred and rash, and regarding him as a victim of the whims of an ungrateful king. It is <b>generally</b> <b>agreed,</b> however, that in his own time he enjoyed great popularity in all layers of society, and that he was skilled at appealing to popular sentiments for political support.|$|E
5|$|When endothermy first {{appeared}} in the evolution of mammals is uncertain, though it is <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> to have first evolved in non-mammalian therapsids. Modern monotremes have lower body temperatures and more variable metabolic rates than marsupials and placentals, but there is evidence that some of their ancestors, perhaps including ancestors of the therians, may have had body temperatures like those of modern therians. Likewise, some modern therians like afrotheres and xenarthrans have secondarily developed lower body temperatures.|$|E

5|$|A major {{point of}} {{consensus}} among all scholars of intellectual giftedness {{is that there}} is no <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> definition of giftedness. Although there is no scholarly agreement about identifying gifted learners, there is a de facto reliance on IQ scores for identifying participants in school gifted education programs. In practice, many school districts in the United States use an IQ score of 130, including about the upper 2 or 3 percent of the national population, as a cut-off score for inclusion in school gifted programs.|$|E
5|$|According to Russian {{statistics}} of 1889, there were 57.8% Lithuanians, 19.1% Poles, and 3.5% Belarusians in the Suwałki Governorate. It is <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> that Lithuanians formed the majority {{population in the}} northern Suwałki Governorate, while Poles were concentrated in south. But, Lithuanian and Polish historians and political scientists continued to disagree over {{the location of the}} line that separated the Lithuanian from the Polish majorities. Lithuanians claimed that Sejny and the surrounding area were inhabited primarily by Lithuanians, while the Poles claimed exactly the opposite. The German census of 1916 showed that 51% of Sejny population was Lithuanian.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the coins (e.g. {{providing}} kings' names), they have proved essential in constructing a chronology of the Kings of Aksum. An estimated 98 percent of the city of Aksum remains unexcavated, and other areas even more so. Through analysis of the number of coins produced and the style of coins, archaeologists have been able to construct a rough chronology, <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> upon until the late 6th- and 7th-century kings. Of the 20 Aksumite Kings attested by their coins, inscriptions corroborate the existence of only two, who happen to be the most famous kings: Ezana and Kaleb, both of whose reigns were periods of exceptional prosperity during the height of the Aksumite kingdom.|$|E
