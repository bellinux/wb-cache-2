5|$|Under the Armoury System, a character's {{equipped}} weapon {{determines the}} character class and players may change their class at will by changing weapons.

Certain abilities learned under one class may be equipped and used by other classes. The Job System builds upon the Armoury System for <b>Disciples</b> <b>of</b> War and Magic. In exchange for restricting the range of equippable abilities from other classes, players gain access to powerful skills, magic, weapons, and armor exclusive to the job corresponding to that class. These jobs, based on classic Final Fantasy character jobs, are more suited to party-based combat.|$|R
