40|$|Background: Ulnar {{neuropathy}} is {{the second}} most common peripheral nerve neuropathy after median neuropathy, with an incidence of 25 cases per 100 000 men and 19 cases per 100 000 women each year. Skipping (snapping) elbow syndrome is an uncommon cause of pain in the posteriormedial elbow area, sometimes complicated by injury of the ulnar nerve. One of the reason is the dislocation of the abnormal insertion of the medial triceps head over the medial epicondyle during flexion and extension movements. Others are: lack of the Osboune fascia leading to ulnar nerve instability and focal soft tissue tumors (fibromas, lipomas, etc). Recurrent subluxation of the nerve at the elbow results in a tractional and frictional neuritis with classical symptoms of peripheral neuralgia. As far as we know snapping triceps syndrome had never been evaluated in sonoelastography. Case Report: A 28 yo semi-professional left handed tennis player was complaining about pain in posterior-medial elbow area. Initial US examination suggest <b>golfers</b> <b>elbow</b> syndrome which occurs quite commonly and has a prevalence of 0. 3 - 0. 6 % in males and 0 - 3 - 1. 1 % in women and may be associated (approx. 50 % of cases) with ulnar neuropathy. However subsequently made MRI revealed unusual distal triceps anatomy, moderate ulnar nerve swelling and lack of medial epicondylitis symptoms. Followed (second) US examination and sonoelastography have detected slipping of the both ulnar nerve and the additional band of the medial triceps head. Discussion: Snapping elbow syndrome is a poorly known medical condition, sometimes misdiagnosed as the medial epicondylitis. It describes a broad range of pathologies and anatomical abnormalities. One of the most often reasons is the slipping of the ulnar nerve {{as the result of the}} Osborne fascia/anconeus epitrochlearis muscle absence. Simultaneously presence of two or more "snapping reasons" is rare but should be always taken under consideration. Conclusions: There are no sonoelastography studies describing <b>golfers</b> <b>elbow</b> syndrome, additional triceps band and ulnar neuritis. Our data suggest that the sonoelastography signs are similar to those seen in well described lateral epicondylitis syndrome, Achilles tendinitis and medial nerve neuralgia...|$|E
40|$|Background: This study {{aimed to}} compare the {{percentage}} of detection of periarthritis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis using clinical examination and ultrasound methods. Materials and Methods: This study is a cross-sectional study which was conducted in Al-Zahra Hospital (Isfahan, Iran) during 2014 – 2015. In our study, ninety patients were selected based on the American College of Rheumatology 2010 criteria. All patients were examined by a rheumatologist to find the existence of effusion, and the data were filled in the checklist. The ultrasonography for detecting effusion in periarticular structures was done by an expert radiologist with two methods, including high-resolution ultrasonography and power Doppler. The percentage of effusion existence found by physical examination was compared by sonography, and the Chi-square and t-tests were used for data analysis. Results: The percentage of effusion found in areas with physical examination by rheumatologist was lower than the frequency distribution of effusions found by sonography (8. 3 % VS 14. 2 %) (P < 0. 001). In sonography, rotator cuff tendonitis {{is the most common}} periarthritis. Other findings in sonography were biceps tendinitis (10 cases), wrist tendonitis (13 cases), olecranon bursitis (9 cases), <b>golfers</b> <b>elbow</b> (4 cases), tennis elbow (4 cases), trochanteric bursitis (6 cases), anserine bursitis (6 cases), prepatellar bursitis (11 cases), and ankle tendonitis (7 cases). Tenderness on physical examination was found in 15 % of the cases, and the evidence of periarthritis was found in 21 / 7 % through sonography (P < 0. 001) and 34 % through Doppler sonography (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: The percentage of periarthritis detection by ultrasonography and power Doppler sonography was higher than clinical examination. Hence, the ultrasonography is more accurate than physical examination...|$|E

50|$|A common {{injury to}} the {{extensor}} carpi ulnaris is <b>golfer's</b> <b>elbow.</b> This injury occurs in people that participate in activities requiring repetitive arm, elbow, and wrist, especially when they are tightly gripping an object. Some symptoms include pain when shaking hands or when squeezing/gripping an object. The pain worsens when a person moves their wrist with force. The pain intensifies because the extensor carpi ulnaris has an injury near the elbow area and as a person moves their arm, the muscle contracts, thus causing it to move over the medial epicondyle of the humerus. This causes irritation to the already existing injury. Some treatments for <b>golfer's</b> <b>elbow</b> include physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medication, and rest from the activity that caused the injury. A similar injury involving the lateral elbow is known as tennis elbow.|$|R
2500|$|Beginning in the Spring of 2013 during grass court season, Levine began {{suffering}} from an elbow problem and numbness in his pinky finger. [...] The problem continued {{for over a}} year. He stopped playing tennis after the Rogers Cup to rehab his elbow, which was first diagnosed as <b>golfer's</b> <b>elbow,</b> and had non-invasive surgery {{in the fall of}} 2013.|$|R
50|$|Symptoms {{associated}} with tennis elbow include, {{but are not}} limited to: radiating pain from the outside of the elbow to the forearm and wrist, pain during extension of wrist, weakness of the forearm, a painful grip while shaking hands or torquing a doorknob, {{and not being able to}} hold relatively heavy items in the hand. The pain is similar to the condition known as <b>golfer's</b> <b>elbow,</b> but the latter occurs at the medial side of the elbow.|$|R
50|$|Repetitive {{strain injury}} (RSI) and {{associative}} trauma orders are umbrella terms {{used to refer}} to several discrete conditions that can be associated with repetitive tasks, forceful exertions, vibrations, mechanical compression, or sustained/awkward positions. Examples of conditions that may sometimes be attributed to such causes include edema, tendinosis (or less often tendinitis), carpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, De Quervain syndrome, thoracic outlet syndrome, intersection syndrome, <b>golfer's</b> <b>elbow</b> (medial epicondylitis), tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis), trigger finger (so-called stenosing tenosynovitis), radial tunnel syndrome, and focal dystonia.|$|R
50|$|Before anesthetics and steroids are used, {{conservative}} {{treatment with}} an occupational therapist may be attempted. Before therapy can commence, treatment {{such as the}} common rest, ice, compression and elevation (R.I.C.E.) will typically be used. This will help to decrease the pain and inflammation; rest will alleviate discomfort because <b>golfer's</b> <b>elbow</b> is an overuse injury. The patient can use a tennis elbow splint for compression. A pad can be placed anteromedially on the proximal forearm. The splint is made in 30-45 degrees of elbow flexion. A daytime elbow pad also may be useful, by limiting additional trauma to the nerve.|$|R
50|$|<b>Golfer's</b> <b>elbow</b> is {{very similar}} to tennis elbow, but less common. It is caused by overuse and {{repetitive}} motions like a golf swing. It can also be caused by trauma. Wrist flexion and pronation (rotating of the forearm) causes irritation to the tendons near the medial epicondyle of the elbow. It can cause pain, stiffness, loss of sensation, and weakness radiating from the inside of the elbow to the fingers.Rest is the primary intervention for this injury. Ice, pain medication, steroid injections, strengthening exercises, and avoiding any aggravating activities can also help. Surgery is a last resort, and rarely used. Exercises should focus on strengthening and stretching the forearm, and utilizing proper form when performing movements.|$|R

50|$|Epicondylitis is {{much more}} common on the lateral side of the elbow (tennis elbow), rather than the medial side. In most cases, its onset is gradual and {{symptoms}} often persist for weeks before patients seek care. In <b>golfer's</b> <b>elbow,</b> pain at the medial epicondyle is aggravated by resisted wrist flexion and pronation, {{which is used to}} aid diagnosis. On the other hand, tennis elbow is indicated by the presence of lateral epicondylar pain precipitated by resisted wrist extension. Although the condition is poorly understood at a cellular and molecular level, there are hypotheses that point to apoptosis and autophagic cell death as causes of chronic lateral epicondylitis. The cell death may decrease the muscle density and cause a snowball effect in muscle weakness - this susceptibility can compromise a muscle's ability to maintain its integrity. So athletes, like pitchers, must work on preventing this cell death via flexibility training and other preventive measures.|$|R
5000|$|Any activity, {{including}} playing tennis, {{that involves}} repetitive {{use of the}} extensor muscles of the forearm can cause acute or chronic tendonitis of the tendinous insertion of these muscles at the lateral epicondyle of the elbow. The condition is common in carpenters and laborers who swing a hammer or other tool with the forearm, and is similar to <b>golfer's</b> <b>elbow,</b> which affects the medial epicondyle {{on the inside of}} the elbow. Continuing activity after onset of the condition and avoiding mandatory rest may lead to permanent onset of pain and only treatable via surgery.German physician F. Runge is usually credited for the first description of the condition, calling it [...] "writer's cramp" [...] (Schreibekrampf) in 1873. [...] Later, it was called [...] "washer women's elbow".

It is currently used with insoles and heel pads to absorb impacts during sports activities such as football, cricket, and rugby, and it is an effective product to help alleviate the symptoms of plantar fasciitis and provide protection against lower limb injuries caused by repetitive motion during games. Because of its unique ability to dramatically diminish shock waves and maintain its shape under stress, Sorbothane has shown promise in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis, also known as tennis elbow, and medial epicondylitis, or <b>golfer's</b> <b>elbow.</b> It is also used in recoil pads of guns.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{biomechanics}} of {{the golf}} swing has been an area of intense research interest {{in an attempt to}} improve swing performance and minimize golf related injuries e. g. lower back pain, <b>golfer's</b> <b>elbow</b> and tendon injuries. Measurements of golf swing kinematics have been previously done using optical motion capture systems e. g. Vicon, Optotrak, which require expensive bulky cameras and long setup times. Further, these systems have largely been limited to the lab or controlled outdoor environments. The recent introduction of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMs) inertial sensors has opened up new avenues to measuring human movement in sports during actual play and competition performance. These sensors have a small form factor, are lightweight, portable and cost effective. In this paper, we analyse the golf swing kinematics measured from inertial sensors to establish sensor parameters which could differentiate between skilled golfers and non-golfers (high handicap). It was found that the sensor data from the hand and upper arm were most discriminative of the two groups. Skilled golfers were able to consistently deliver high acceleration swings with lower pelvis movement compared to beginner golfers...|$|R
50|$|The {{condition}} is called <b>Golfer's</b> <b>Elbow</b> because {{in making a}} golf swing this tendon is stressed, especially if a non-overlapping (baseball style) grip is used; many people, however, who develop the condition have never handled a golf club. It is also sometimes called Pitcher's Elbow due to the same tendon being stressed by the throwing of objects such as a baseball, but this usage is much less frequent. Other names are Climber's Elbow and Little League Elbow: all of the flexors of the fingers and the pronators of the forearm insert at the medial epicondyle of the humerus to include: pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis, flexor carpi ulnaris, flexor digitorum superficialis, and palmaris longus; making this the most common elbow injury for rock climbers, whose sport is very grip intensive. The pain is normally caused due to stress on the tendon {{as a result of}} the large amount of grip exerted by the digits and torsion of the wrist which is caused by the use and action of the cluster of muscles on the condyle of the ulna.|$|R
40|$|In {{the second}} part of this review article the {{management}} of medial elbow tendinopathy, distal biceps and distal triceps tendinopathy will be discussed. There is a scarcity of publications concerning any of these tendinopathies. This review will summarise the current best available evidence in their management. Medial elbow tendinopathy, also known as <b>Golfer’s</b> <b>elbow,</b> is up to 6 times less common than lateral elbow tendinopathy. The tendinopathy occurs in the insertion of pronator teres and flexor carpi radialis. Diagnosis is usually apparent through a detailed history and examination but care must be made to exclude other conditions affecting the ulnar nerve or less commonly the ulnar collateral ligament complex. If doubt exists then MRI/US and electrophysiology can be used. Treatment follows a similar pattern to that of lateral elbow tendinopathy. Acute management is with activity modification and topical NSAIDs. Injection therapy and surgical excision are utilised for recalcitrant cases. Distal biceps and triceps tendinopathies are very rare and there is limited evidence published. Sequelae of tendinopathy include tendon rupture and so it is vital tomanage these tendinopathies appropriately in order to minimise this significant complication. Their management and that of partial tears will be considered...|$|R
40|$|Disorders causing pain in {{the elbow}} region is a common problem {{and is one of}} the most {{frequent}} forms of work-related health problems. These conditions are thus of major importance from the public health point of view, as well as from that of the suffering individual. Both sensory and motor function may be impaired, particularly in cases where a nerve is involved, resulting in severely impaired hand function. “Tennis elbow” (lateral epicondylalgia) has been found to be the second most frequently diagnosed musculoskeletal disorder of the upper extremity in the primary health-care setting. “Golfer’s elbow” (medial epicondylalgia) is not that commonly encountered. It has been stated that tennis or <b>golfer’s</b> <b>elbow</b> syndromes are self-limiting. Even so, clinical experience has shown that there are a few cases where symptoms have a painful and long-lasting course, resistant to many forms of therapy. The outcomes of frequently adopted management regimes for treatment of epicondylalgia or nerve entrapments around the elbow were examined in the following five studies: I: A randomised, prospective study of 38 patients with tennis elbow (lateral epicondylalgia). Groups were assigned to eccentric exercises or stretching. Eccentric exercise gave somewhat better results. In a second part of the study, a 4 -year follow-up of 127 patients who used eccentric exercises for tennis elbow was performed. Patients showed decreased pain and increased grip-strength after 3 months treatment. At the time of publication this study was the first to examine eccentric exercises for this condition. II: A retrospective analysis of long-term results from 51 patients treated with surgical release of the common extensor origin because of “chronic tennis elbow”. Eighty-seven per cent of the patients rated themselves as completely recovered or improved. III: A randomised, prospective study of 70 patients with ulnar neuropathy in the forearm (cubital tunnel syndrome). Groups assigned the commonly recommended elbow brace at night or nerve gliding exercises were compared with a control group (information only). The majority of patients improved considerably, both subjectively and objectively, after a 3 months period, regardless of group. The study thus showed the effectiveness of information and expectance, and that orthosis or nerve gliding exercises added nothing further to the result. IV: A retrospective study of 205 patients treated with surgery for suspected nerve entrapment in the forearm. Followup, almost 4 years later, demonstrated a subjective improvement in two of three patients, but only 3 % experienced complete relief of all symptoms. V: A prospective long-term study on 20 patients with <b>golfer’s</b> <b>elbow</b> (medial epicondylalgia) treated with eccentric exercises over 3 months. The results showed decreased pain and increased gripstrength. This is the first study published on the management of this disorder with eccentric exercises...|$|R
40|$|Elbow pain is {{a common}} {{complaint}} in throwing athletes and <b>golfers.</b> Medial-sided <b>elbow</b> problems such as flexor/pronator strain, ulnar collateral ligament injury, ulnar nerve conditions, and medial epicondylitis are usually more common, but lateral elbow conditions such as lateral epicondylitis and osteochondritis dissecans can also occur. Sometimes lateral elbow pain {{can be associated with}} mechanical symptoms, such as snapping or catching, or the location of the pain is posterolateral and not along the lateral epicondyle or extensor tendon origin.

40|$|Medial epicondylitis, a {{condition}} seen commonly in golfers and pitchers, develops {{as a result}} of medial stress overload on the flexor musculature at the elbow. 2, 14 The medial elbow muscle overload is typically obtained by repetitive golf swings or pitching—hence, the term <b>golfer’s</b> <b>elbow</b> or pitcher’s elbow. Most pathology occurs in the musculotendinous origin of the flexor carpi radialis and pronator teres. 1, 8 Large diffuse tears can also occur in the palmaris longus, flexor digitorum superficialis, and flexor carpi ulnaris. 10, 11 The injury is a result of tendinous microtearing owing to muscle-tendon overload. 13 Following the overload, tendon degeneration occurs instead of repair. 10, 11 Medial epicondylitis presents as pain at the medial epicondyle, aggravated by activities that resist the flexor muscles of the wrist. Medial epicondylitis can cause pain and weakness throughout the upper extremity and can result in impairment or disability. 9, 11 Treatment of medial epicondylitis before surgery includes anti-inflammatory drugs, massages, elbow braces, and steroid injections. 5 Cervical radiculopathy can radiate pain, paresthesia, numbness, or weakness into the arms. 12, 15 Multiple associations of lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) to the cervical spine have been made, but minimal association between the medial epicondylitis and the cervical spine has been proposed. 9 Gunn documented 50 patients with nonresolving lateral elbow symptoms. 7 Cervical spine treatment produced improvement of elbow symptoms within 5. 25 weeks. Gunn concluded that the patients had cervical degeneration before the onset of their elbow symptoms and that cervical therapy alleviated the elbow symptoms. 7 C 6 and C 7 radiculopathy affects muscles that ar...|$|R
40|$|Entheses (insertion sites, osteotendinous junctions, osteoligamentous junctions) are {{sites of}} stress {{concentration}} at {{the region where}} tendons and ligaments attach to bone. Consequently, they are commonly subject to overuse injuries (enthesopathies) that are well documented {{in a number of}} sports. In this review, we focus on the structure–function correlations of entheses on both the hard and the soft tissue sides of the junction. Particular attention is paid to mechanical factors that influence form and function and thus to exploring the relationship between entheses and exercise. The molecular parameters indicative of adaptation to mechanical stress are evaluated, and the basis on which entheses are classified is explained. The application of the ‘enthesis organ’ concept (a collection of tissues adjacent to the enthesis itself, which jointly serve the common function of stress dissipation) to understanding enthesopathies is considered and novel roles of adipose tissue at entheses are reviewed. A distinction is made between different locations of fat at entheses, and possible functions include space-filling and proprioception. The basic anchorage role of entheses is considered in detail and comparisons are explored between entheses and other biological ‘anchorage’ sites. The ability of entheses for self-repair is emphasized and a range of enthesopathies common in sport are reviewed (e. g. tennis <b>elbow,</b> <b>golfer's</b> <b>elbow,</b> jumper's knee, plantar fasciitis and Achilles insertional tendinopathies). Attention is drawn to the degenerative, rather than inflammatory, nature of most enthesopathies in sport. The biomechanical factors contributing to the development of enthesopathies are reviewed and the importance of considering the muscle–tendon–bone unit as a whole is recognized. Bony spur formation is assessed in relation to other changes at entheses which parallel those in osteoarthritic synovial joints...|$|R
