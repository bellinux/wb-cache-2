For the sauce, originally fresh white tuna (in most restaurants canned tuna is used today to reduce cost and preparation time) is simmered until fully cooked in white wine, cider vinegar, white onion and garlic, and then puréed with a mix of olive and vegetable oil and egg yolks in an electric blender or food processor to form a thick mayonnaise. For the mayonnaise a variety of seasonings can be used, including anchovies, cayenne pepper and lemon juice. The thick, smooth purée is then somewhat thinned with a little water and cooking liquid from the veal and a few capers are stirred in. Some of the sauce is spread out on a serving platter and the cold slices of veal are arranged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> <b>on</b> top.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{the effect}} of several {{axisymmetric}} elastic singularities (i. e., point forces, double forces, sum of two double forces and centers of dilatation) on the elastic response of a multilayered solid is investigated. The boundary conditions in an infinite solid at the plane passing through the singularity are derived first using Papkovich–Neuber harmonic functions. Then, a Green’s function solution for multilayered solids is obtained by solving a set of simultaneous linear algebraic equations using both the boundary conditions for the singularity and the layer interfaces. Finally, the elastic solutions <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> <b>on</b> an infinite substrate due to point defects and infinitesimal prismatic dislocation loops are presented to illustrate the application of these Green’s function solutions...|$|E

For shadow imaging, we describe a curvature-based metric that is computed from the particle boundary points in the FFT domain using a low-frequency parametric representation. We also describe how missing boundary points are approximated using band-limited interpolation so that the FFT can be applied. For cross-section imaging, we describe a new Bayesian-motivated segmentation scheme as well as a new technique to correct layer measurements for the fact that we cannot observe the true mid-plane of the approximately spherical particles...|$|E

40|$|Aims: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the feasibility of the absorption of lead and cadmium from the leachate, by natural zeolite clinoptilolite and improving the zeolite ability by a modified surface. Materials and Methods: To examine the absorption ability of these two metals (lead and cadmium), the variables, such as, type of sorbent, sorbent concentration, and contact time were studied. Zeolite samples were analyzed by X-ray florescence, the spectrum of X-ray diffraction, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET). Results: The absorption efficiency of the modified zeolites were increased from 4. 2 and 5. 3 percent to 71. 6 and 75. 2 percent for lead and cadmium, respectively. With increasing the surfactant concentration from 2 to 20 mmol/L, the absorption efficiency of modified zeolite for lead and cadmium was increased to 71 and 74 %, respectively. The best isotherm model for lead adsorption was Freundlich model, with a determination coefficient equal to 0. 99, and for cadmium it was Langmuir model with a determination coefficient equal to 0. 99. Conclusions: The modified zeolite with surfactant can be used as an appropriate adsorbent for the separation of heavy metals from waste Leachate. Lead and cadmium were absorbed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> <b>on</b> the surface of the modified zeolite with surfactant, comparing different isoterm models, indicated that the capacity of the modified zeolite for lead adsorption was more than cadmium adsorption, but cadmium was absorbed with higher energy...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of freezing methods and post-mortem ageing days for frozen beef m. longissimus lumborum (LL) on colour, moisture characteristics; characteristics and sensory characteristics. There were 3 freezing treatments: fresh, never frozen (FR); quick-frozen (QF), and slow-frozen (SF). All fresh and frozen beef m. longissimus lumborum samples were aged for 3 or 14 -days and frozen beef samples were frozen before ageing. Materials and methods Three replications of 7 beef samples (steaks) per treatment (total of 3 -days, n= 126) were used. Fresh beef samples (FR) were kept in a cold room at 3 °C until the next morning (Day 3). Slow-frozen samples (SF) were packed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> <b>on</b> 3 shelves of a house hold freezer (AEG Skandiluxe) to reach a core temperature of - 20 °C. Quick-frozen samples (QF) were placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> <b>on</b> 3 shelves of an IcematicT 15 - 2 P blast freezer to a reach to core temperature of - 30 °C in 3 hours. All samples for the two freezing treatments were stored after the freezing processing at - 20 °C freezer room and were then thawed in vacuum packages for 18 hours at 3 °C in a dark chiller before analyses. Results Moisture characteristics The freezing methods and ageing days had a significant effect (P< 0. 001) on moisture characteristics but showed no effect on cooking losses. Drip loss and more pressed out water were higher for samples aged for 3 -days compared to 14 -days ageing postmortem. The effect of ageing days on moisture characterises was different for fresh compared to frozen beef samples (interaction: P< 0. 001). Drip loss of frozen steaks during 3 -days ageing post-mortem was significantly higher (P< 0. 001) than those aged for 14 -days. Drip loss between fresh samples aged for 3 and 14 -days nor between frozen samples aged for 3 or 14 -days. Colour characteristics Most colour characteristics were significantly affected by freezing methods and postmortem ageing days. Fresh beef samples had significantly higher (P< 0. 001) values for redness (a*) and chroma, lower values (P< 0. 05) for hue (closer to typical red colour) and were brighter (higher L*) than samples of both freezing methods. Higher (P< 0. 001) OxyMb and lower MetMb were recorded for fresh compared to frozen samples. Beef samples aged for 3 -days had lower (P< 0. 05) b* (less yellow) and hue angle values than those aged for 14 -days. DeoxyMb and OxyMb were higher and MetMb lower (P< 0. 05) in 3 -days samples compared to 14 -days samples. Sensory characteristics Freezing method had a significant effect (P< 0. 001) on WBSF, tenderness related sensory attributes and meat flavour. Fresh samples were tougher than frozen samples according to WBSF and sensory scores for first bite, overall tenderness, and residual connective tissue. In addition, quick-frozen samples were also significantly more tender (P< 0. 001) than slow-frozen samples according to all three tenderness related sensory parameters. Conclusion Overall, freezing methods and post-mortem ageing days influenced moisture and colour characteristics of beef. Quick freezing method improves tenderness measured as WBSF or sensory tenderness, but neither freezing method nor post-mortem ageing period (day 3 and day 14) had a meaningful effect on cooking losses.

After these periods, the water content of seeds was determined, at 105 ± 3 °C/ 24 h, and the germination test was performed at 25 - 35 °C, on paper and a photoperiod of 8 h. In the electrical conductivity test, the pattern of exudates leaching was evaluated at different periods of imbibition (2, 4, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h), at three numbers of seeds per replicate (25, 50 and 75) and three volumes of deionized water (50, 75 and 100 mL) at 25 °C. The accelerated aging test conducted at 45 °C provided a progressive decrease in the germination {{with the increase of}} the aging period. For the electrical conductivity test, lower values were observed with an increasing seed number and the imbibition volume, and higher values with the increase of the periods of imbibition. Therefore the accelerated aging test conducted at 45 °C for 72 h, and the electrical conductivity test performed with 25 seeds imbibed in 50 mL of deionized water for at least 48 h at 25 °C, are adequate to evaluate the physiological quality of D. vandellianum seeds...|$|E

40|$|The {{lipid bilayer}} forms the basic {{structure}} of the cell membrane, which is a heterogeneous matrix of proteins and lipids that provides a barrier between the interior of a cell and its outside environment. Protein and lipid domains in cell membranes can facilitate receptor localization, stabilize membranes, and influence membrane fluidity. In this thesis, we study how ordered protein and lipid domains influence the physical properties of lipid bilayers to better understand the roles of membrane domains in biological mechanisms. Model cellular membranes that mimic the behavior of biological membranes offer a controllable environment for systematically studying the isolated effects of protein and lipid ordering on membrane organization. Using fluid and solid-supported lipid bilayers, we study ordered peripheral membrane proteins and lateral lipid phase separation with fluorescence microscopy and X-ray reflectivity. To model cellular protein coatings and peripheral proteins, we prepare biotin-functionalized membranes that bind the proteins streptavidin and avidin. Fluorescence microscopy studies demonstrate that proteins crystallized <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> <b>on</b> lipid bilayer surfaces can change the lipid curvature and stabilize lipid vesicles against osmotic collapse. (cont.) At solid interfaces, we characterize the electron density profiles of protein-coated bilayers to determine how a water layer separates an immobile protein layer from the fluid lipid bilayer. Liquid-ordered lipid phases enriched in cholesterol and sphingomyelin can localize molecules in cell membranes and this lipid phase separation behavior may be influenced by proteins and molecules in the membrane. Caveolae are specialized liquid-ordered domains in the plasma membrane that are enriched in the protein caveolin- 1. We demonstrate that caveolin- 1 peptides influence the onset of lipid phase separation and bind phase-separated lipid bilayers in solution. On solid surfaces, the formation of liquid-ordered lipid phases is influenced by surface roughness; with reflectivity, we determine that lipid bilayers containing cholesterol and sphingomyelin thicken with increasing cholesterol content. The membrane receptor GM 1 also thickens the lipid bilayer when it is incorporated into the bilayer upper leaflet. The diverse experimental platforms that we present are applicable to studying additional and more complex biological systems to elucidate the influence of lipid and protein domains on cell membrane structure, organization and fluidity. by Margaret R.
