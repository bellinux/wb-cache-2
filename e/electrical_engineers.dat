5|$|At the University of Illinois, Polish-born {{research}} engineer Joseph Tykociński-Tykociner {{was working}} independently {{on a similar}} process. On June 9, 1922, he gave the first reported U.S. demonstration of a sound-on-film motion picture {{to members of the}} American Institute of <b>Electrical</b> <b>Engineers.</b> As with Lauste and Tigerstedt, Tykociner's system would never be taken advantage of commercially; however, De Forest's soon would.|$|E
5|$|By 1993, BuroHappold had 130 {{employees}} and eight partners. In 1998 this {{had grown to}} 300 {{employees and}} 12 partners, while in 2000 with over 500 employees the partnership was increased to 23. In 2006 the partnership stood at 25 with over 1400 employees and 14 offices. Due to this growth {{and the addition of}} so many different services, the company was restructured in 2003 to consist of multi-disciplinary teams of engineers, each with structural, mechanical and <b>electrical</b> <b>engineers</b> supported by specialist consulting groups.|$|E
5|$|Early filters {{utilised}} {{the phenomenon}} of resonance to filter signals. Although electrical resonance had been investigated by researchers from a very early stage, it was at first not widely understood by <b>electrical</b> <b>engineers.</b> Consequently, the much more familiar concept of acoustic resonance (which in turn, can be {{explained in terms of}} the even more familiar mechanical resonance) found its way into filter design ahead of electrical resonance. Resonance can be used to achieve a filtering effect because the resonant device will respond to frequencies at, or near, to the resonant frequency but will not respond to frequencies far from resonance. Hence frequencies far from resonance are filtered out from the output of the device.|$|E

5|$|Electrical {{phenomena}} {{have been}} studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries. Even then, practical applications for electricity were few, and it would not be until the late nineteenth century that <b>electrical</b> <b>engineers</b> were able to put it to industrial and residential use. The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution. Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation. Electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society.|$|E
5|$|Hammer {{was awarded}} the Elliott Cresson Gold Medal from the Franklin Institute for his {{collection}} in 1906. The General Electric Company bought the collection from Hammer in 1912 for $10,000. It then was donated to the Edison Association of Illuminating Companies. The collection was put into a formal display room in 1913 at the Headquarters of the American Institute of <b>Electrical</b> <b>Engineers</b> in New York City. The display information for each Case is how it existed in 1913 after Hammer had collected these light bulbs for 34 years. In 1931 the light bulb collection had an estimated value of over a million dollars.|$|E
5|$|The {{structural}} engineering firm Worthington, Skilling, Helle & Jackson worked to implement Yamasaki's design, developing the tube-frame structural system {{used in the}} buildings. The Port Authority's Engineering Department served as foundation engineers, Joseph R. Loring & Associates as <b>electrical</b> <b>engineers,</b> and Jaros, Baum & Bolles (JB) as mechanical engineers. Tishman Realty & Construction Company was the general contractor on the World Trade Center project. Guy F. Tozzoli, director of the World Trade Department at the Port Authority, and the Port Authority's Chief Engineer, Rino M. Monti, oversaw the project.|$|E

5|$|Victorian {{composer}} and organist W. H. Jude (1851–1922) was a prolific lecturer and hymnodist, and opened over 1000 organs across the UK and Australasia during his career. Another composer {{associated with the}} school was Peter Fenn (1931–2011), director of music for Anglia Television, who attended the school as an evacuee during World War II. Philip Vassar Hunter (1883–1956) was awarded the CBE for his anti-submarine research in World War I, and in World War II invented the buoyant cable which contributed to {{the defeat of the}} magnetic mine. He was later President of the Institution of <b>Electrical</b> <b>Engineers</b> and manager of the British Ice Hockey Association.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with getting}} the motor patented, Peck and Brown {{arranged}} {{to get the}} motor publicized, starting with independent testing to verify it was a functional improvement, followed by press releases sent to technical publications for articles to run concurrent {{with the issue of}} the patent. Physicist William Arnold Anthony (who tested the motor) and Electrical World magazine editor Thomas Commerford Martin arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his alternating current motor on 16 May 1888 at the American Institute of <b>Electrical</b> <b>Engineers.</b> Engineers working for the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company reported to George Westinghouse that Tesla had a viable AC motor and related power system — something Westinghouse needed for the alternating current system he was already marketing. Westinghouse looked into getting a patent on a similar commutator-less, rotating magnetic field-based induction motor developed in 1885 and presented in a paper in March 1888 by Italian physicist Galileo Ferraris, but decided that Tesla's patent would probably control the market.|$|E
5|$|As chief {{engineer}} at Altec, Hilliard joined the Hollywood {{section of the}} Sapphire Group, a regular social gathering of sound recordists and a precursor to the Audio Engineering Society. In 1948, Hilliard was elected to chair the Sapphire Group Recording Standards Committee. He made certain, along with the Motion Picture Research Council, that proposed industry standards were forwarded to members of National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE), Acoustical Society of America (ASA) and Royal Musical Association (RMA). Hilliard helped form the Los Angeles section of the Audio Engineering Society (AES) in 1951. At the beginning of 1963, IRE merged with the American Institute of <b>Electrical</b> <b>Engineers</b> (AIEE) to form the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE)—Hilliard retained his Fellowship.|$|E

5|$|Coalhouse Fort was manned {{during the}} First World War by No. 2 Company, Royal Garrison Artillery, which manned the guns, while the 2nd Company London <b>Electrical</b> <b>Engineers</b> {{operated}} the electric searchlights. A minefield {{was installed in}} the river between Shornemead and Coalhouse forts, with mechanically operated mines in the shallower parts {{of the river and}} remotely detonated mines in the navigable channel. Friendly ships could thus pass freely but the mines could be detonated by a shore-based observer if an enemy ship tried to use the main channel. Coalhouse Fort took on the role of an Examination Battery controlling the river traffic in conjunction with the River Examination Service. Incoming vessels were checked by tugs based alongside the old HMS Champion, moored in midriver, and if any vessel was deemed suspect or refused to stop, the fort was authorised to fire across its bows.|$|E
