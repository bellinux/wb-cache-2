500|$|Hull was {{promoted}} to flying officer on 16 April 1938. As war loomed, the squadron began to prepare for combat in late 1938, and in December that year was re-equipped with Hawker HurricaneMkIs. Hull reacted to {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War in September 1939 with great excitement; according to Hector Bolitho, No. 43 Squadron's intelligence officer, the Rhodesian leapt <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other in the officer's mess, repeating the words [...] "wizard, wizard".|$|E
2500|$|The ISUCF'V'MB {{utilizes}} {{a unique}} and traditional marching style during its pregame presentations. The high-step march (used {{for the majority of}} pregame) incorporates a high leg/knee motion combined with a downward toe point. In addition, a similar half-height, double-time version of the high-step, called 'X'ing, is used to enter the field for pregame performances. The swing cadence the band uses to march into the tunnel is also an ISUCF'V'MB signature; members move in a half-time while jumping <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other to cadence in a motion that is similar to hopping. For halftime performances the band uses [...] "glide step", which allows it to maximize its musical and marching output. This is the step the band uses during parades.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout his career, Laudrup was {{acclaimed}} for his technique, balance, elegance, vision, ball control, deep {{passes and}} dribbling ability. In regard to his vision, Jorge Valdano, the Argentinian coach of Laudrup in Real Madrid, said, [...] "e has eyes everywhere." [...] His trademark move– looking {{one way and}} passing the other– fooled countless opponents during his career. The Laudrup dribble, a feint {{also known as the}} croqueta, was perhaps the best-known part of his game, and involved him quickly moving the ball <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other away from the defender. His skills and feints were combined with creativity, which he used to get past defenders in one on one situations. This led to the expression [...] "Made in Laudrup", widely used in Spain about his creative style of play. Numerous teammates of his have said, [...] "Just run, he will always find a way of passing you the ball." ...|$|E
50|$|Skips: (12),(34),5,6,(78) (or slow-slow-quick-quick-slow): skip...skip...skip-skip-skip. A skip is <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> another, the freed foot {{pointing}} forward, toe on the floor.|$|R
60|$|The {{other men}} shifted <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> another {{and there were}} {{deep-drawn}} breaths. Jim Cleve alone seemed quiet and cool. But his eyes were ablaze.|$|R
6000|$|McIlheny: [...] "Go ahn, sor; or I'll {{have to do}} the beginnun' meself, pretty soon." [...] He shifts himself <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> {{another with}} a saltatory briskness.|$|R
60|$|Laban {{shifted his}} weight where he stood <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other.|$|E
60|$|The baby did not hush. Meg {{rose from}} her chair and stood rocking the baby in her arms, swaying <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other.|$|E
6000|$|He {{shifted his}} weight <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other. [...] "Well, it's a pretty rough old village, Flo--a pretty rough place for you and mother." ...|$|E
60|$|My gudesire saw {{everything}} look so muckle against him, that he grew nearly desperate--however, {{he shifted}} <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> another, looked to {{every corner of}} the room, and made no answer.|$|R
5000|$|Strophe (from Greek , [...] "turn, bend, twist") is {{a concept}} in versification which {{properly}} means a turn, as <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> another, or <b>from</b> <b>one</b> side of a chorus to the other.|$|R
60|$|Old Miguel stood silent, {{shifting}} <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> another, {{his eyes}} cast down, his slender brown fingers spasmodically pressing {{the rim of}} his sombrero. But when he spoke {{it was in his}} former quiet manner.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Podgers's eyes blinked {{behind his}} gold-rimmed spectacles, {{and he moved}} uneasily <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other, while his fingers played nervously with a flash watch-chain.|$|E
6000|$|Then he rose {{up in his}} littleness, {{and began}} to dance slowly <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other, waving his lean arms over the fire, and singing, in the secret {{language}} of the Mulla-mulgars, as loud as ever he could: ...|$|E
6000|$|Captain Lige listened, and {{he shifted}} <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other, {{and rubbed his}} hands, which were red. Some odd trick of the mind had put into his head two people--Eliphalet Hopper and Jacob Cluyme. Was he like them? ...|$|E
60|$|Plain it {{was that}} my friend felt uncomfortable; he shifted <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> another, and a cloud darkened his brow. But his blue eyes burned with a warm light as {{he put his hand}} on my shoulder.|$|R
50|$|The {{pool and}} {{surrounding}} beach occupied 4.5 acre of the park. Holding approximately five {{million gallons of}} filtered, chlorinated water, the seven hundred foot-long pool was supplied by artesian wells. The depth ranged <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> 10 ft.|$|R
50|$|Male {{and female}} dance styles differ greatly, {{although}} their actions are synchronised and use similar shapes {{to evoke the}} words and feelings of the music {{to which they are}} dancing. Women's hand movements are generally slow and graceful, similar to the shapes made in Samoan or Tongan dance, and with their feet almost together, they make a subtle shuffling movement in time to the music, shifting weight <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> another. On the other hand, male movements are usually more vigorous and defined, with a more dramatic shifting of weight <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> another, enabled by having their legs usually further apart and somewhat crouching, such that the man half of a tautoga usually appears lower than the female half.|$|R
60|$|This did {{not seem}} to {{encourage}} the witness at all: he kept shifting <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.|$|E
60|$|ANNA--[The exultation {{again in}} her voice.] I love it! I don't give a rap if it never lifts! [CHRIS fidgets <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other worriedly. ANNA {{continues}} slowly, after a pause.] It {{makes me feel}} clean--out here--'s if I'd taken a bath.|$|E
6000|$|Before she came, I had a mind {{to prove}} the celebrity of a poet on {{the spot where he}} lived and died,--on his very hearthstone, as it were. So I asked the lout, who stood gnawing a stick and {{shifting}} his weight <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other,-- ...|$|E
50|$|Walking, for example, {{involves}} {{shifting of}} the body's weight <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> another, so freeing the first {{so that it}} may be lifted and moved forward. This process is a 'natural' movement in humans and other animals, but is in effect a complex process of biomechanics.|$|R
6000|$|Mowgli hardly {{lifted his}} head as Hathi gave him [...] "Good hunting." [...] He kept him {{swinging}} and rocking, and shifting <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> another, {{for a long time}} before he spoke; and when he opened his mouth it was to Bagheera, not to the elephants.|$|R
50|$|Various baits {{are used}} {{depending}} on the target animal. These traps can be <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> four <b>feet</b> long. The width and height can vary, but are usually about <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> by <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> in height and width or less. They can be made at home or commercially bought.|$|R
60|$|As St. Clare {{turned to}} go back his eye fell upon Tom, who was {{standing}} uneasily, shifting <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other, while Adolph stood negligently leaning against the banisters, examining Tom through an opera-glass, with an air that would have done credit to any dandy living.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Behold! The {{spirits of}} our fathers have arisen and great deeds are afoot this night!' He stepped back, and another young man {{somewhat}} diffidently came forward, pushed on by his comrades. He towered a full head above them, his broad chest defiantly bared to the frost. He swung tentatively <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other.|$|E
60|$|Abel Hunt stood {{shifting}} uneasily <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other, {{half a dozen}} paces distant, as if deliberating {{whether he}} would have further speech {{with me on the}} subject of breeding, and I fancied, perhaps because I hoped it might be so, that he was eager to turn his attention to something more diverting than acting as a shadow to Pierre and me.|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't {{know these}} people," [...] said Jones, {{shifting}} uneasily <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> another. [...] "They're all brigands by nature {{and many of}} them by profession. As soon as the soldiers are sent north, all law and order will cease and brigandage will be the order of the day!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I dunno," [...] Sally said, easing herself <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> {{another and}} {{shifting}} the milk-bucket from {{her right hand}} to her left. [...] "Where everybody is goun' one way, you don't {{know what to think}} exactly. Jane Gillespie was there, and she went on as bad as the best." ...|$|R
5000|$|Rock step (also called break step) may {{refer to}} one of similar dance moves. The name refers to the rocking action during the move: the weight is {{transferred}} <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> another and then back. It is used {{in a number of}} dances, such as East Coast Swing, Zydeco, Lindy Hop, Tango.|$|R
60|$|Sheldon {{held the}} rifle {{on him and}} waited. The black glanced around at his fellows, but none moved to aid him. They were intent upon the coming spectacle, staring fascinated at the white man with death in his hands who stood alone on the great veranda. Sheldon has won, and he knew it. Astoa changed his weight irresolutely <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other. He looked at the white man, and saw his eyes gleaming level along the sights.|$|E
60|$|Little Frenchie patted {{me on the}} shoulder; but {{remained}} silent. Saul stood shifting uneasily <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other, not attempting to bid me good-bye, nor even to meet my gaze, and I understood that he was saying to himself with shame that he ought at least have striven to act the part of messenger, rather than held his peace, which was {{much the same as}} showing that he did not dare make the venture.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gradually, a few at a time, {{the little}} meadow people crept {{out from their}} hiding places and formed a great circle around the old dead stump. With old Mother Nature there they felt sure that no harm could come to them. Then they began {{to laugh at the}} funny sight of fierce old Mr. Owl hopping <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other on top of the old dead stump. It was the first laugh on the Green Meadows for a long, long, long time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, to {{tell the}} truth," [...] said Rupert, {{shifting}} restlessly <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> another, [...] "the milkman himself, as far as merely physical appearances went, just said, 'Milk, Miss,' and handed in the can. That is not to say, of course, {{that he did not}} make some secret sign or some--" ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Soles {{shifted her}} weight <b>from</b> <b>one</b> slippered <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> the other.|$|R
60|$|He shifted <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> another, {{and looked}} as if he wished himself out of my way. At a later time of my life, I have {{observed}} that these are signs by which an honest man is apt to confess that he has told, or is going to tell, a lie. As it was, I only noticed that he answered confusedly.|$|R
