5|$|Botanists {{study how}} plants produce food {{and how to}} {{increase}} yields, for example through plant breeding, making their work important to mankind's ability to feed the world and provide food security for future generations. Botanists also study weeds, which are a considerable problem <b>in</b> <b>agriculture,</b> and the biology and control of plant pathogens <b>in</b> <b>agriculture</b> and natural ecosystems. Ethnobotany {{is the study of}} the relationships between plants and people. When applied to the investigation of historical plant–people relationships ethnobotany may be referred to as archaeobotany or palaeoethnobotany. Some of the earliest plant-people relationships arose between the indigenous people of Canada in identifying edible plants from inedible plants. This relationship the indigenous people had with plants was recorded by ethnobotanists.|$|E

5|$|Perón's second Five-Year Plan in 1952 favoured {{increased}} agricultural output over industrialization, but {{industrial growth}} and high wages {{in previous years}} had expanded the domestic demand for agrarian goods. During the 1950s, output of beef and grain fell, and the economy suffered. The policy shift toward agricultural production created a gap in income distribution, as {{the majority of those}} who worked <b>in</b> <b>agriculture</b> laboured on tiny plots, while the majority of the land was in large estates. Argentina signed trade agreements with Britain, the Soviet Union and Chile, slightly opening the market to international trade as Perón's second economic plan sought to capitalize on the country's comparative advantage <b>in</b> <b>agriculture.</b>|$|E

5|$|Agriculture is the {{economic}} foundation of most countries, and {{for developing countries}} a likely source of economic growth. Growth <b>in</b> <b>agriculture</b> can benefit the rural poor, though it does not always do so. Profits from crops can increase from higher value crops, better marketing, value-adding activities such as processing, or expanded access {{for the public to}} markets.Profits can also decrease through reduced demand or increased production. Crop diversity can protect againstcrop failure, and can also offer higher returns.|$|E
