500|$|Agnes and {{her sister}} were virgins of Rome {{in the time of}} the Emperor Constantine, though all figures are shown in {{contemporary}} 14th-century dress. The story begins {{on the inside of the}} bowl, which has a round medallion showing St Agnes kneeling before a bearded figure, representing her teacher, wearing a chaperon. She holds a book inscribed Miserere mei Deus sancte ("Have pity on me, Holy God"), while a banderole says In corde meo abscondi eloquia tua ut non peccem tibi ("Thy words have I hid in my heart that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> sin against thee". [...] ). [...] The top of the cover continues the story up to Agnes' martyrdom in five scenes, shown with a continuous groundline from which small rocks rise up to demarcate the scenes; on the base trees perform this function. Sunrays radiate from the centre of the cover above all the scenes; the red enamel which once filled these is nearly all lost.|$|E
500|$|Brosnan has {{expressed}} contempt for his education by the Christian Brothers. However, in 2013 he commented, [...] "It always {{helps to have}} a bit of prayer in your back pocket. At the end of the day, you have to have something and for me that is God, Jesus, my Catholic upbringing, my faith... God has been good to me. My faith has been good to me in the moments of deepest suffering, doubt and fear. It is a constant, the language of prayer... <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have got my sums right from the Christian Brothers or might not have got the greatest learning of literature from them but I certainly got a strapping amount of faith." [...] Brosnan attends Mass, but adheres to other spiritual beliefs. In 2008 he said [...] "I also love the teachings of Buddhist philosophy. It's my own private faith. I don't preach it, but it's a faith that is a comfort to me when the night is long." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the tour, Black Sabbath {{returned}} to Los Angeles and again rented {{a house in}} Bel Air, where they spent nearly a year working on new material for the next album. The entire band were abusing both alcohol and other drugs, but Iommi says Osbourne [...] "was on a totally different level altogether". The band {{would come up with}} new song ideas but Osbourne showed little interest and would refuse to sing them. Pressure from the record label and frustrations with Osbourne's lack of input coming to a head, Iommi made the decision to fire Osbourne in 1979. Iommi believed the only options available were to fire Osbourne or break the band up completely. [...] "At that time, Ozzy had come to an end", Iommi said. [...] "We were all doing a lot of drugs, a lot of coke, a lot of everything, and Ozzy was getting drunk so much at the time. We were supposed to be rehearsing and nothing was happening. It was like 'Rehearse today? No, we'll do it tomorrow.' It really got so bad that we didn't do anything. It just fizzled out." [...] Drummer Ward, who was close with Osbourne, was chosen by Tony to break the news to the singer on 27 April 1979. [...] "I hope I was professional, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have been, actually. When I'm drunk I am horrible, I am horrid", Ward said. [...] "Alcohol was definitely one of the most damaging things to Black Sabbath. We were destined to destroy each other. The band were toxic, very toxic." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} the 2010–11 season, Morison handed in {{a written}} {{transfer}} request amid speculation about a move to newly promoted Premier League side Norwich City. Millwall subsequently rejected the transfer request. A day later, Morison revealed [...] "Norwich have made a couple of bids that have been turned down so I've done what I've done. I want to play in the Premier League, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> get another opportunity". On 2 June 2011, Millwall accepted an offer from Norwich City for Morison after the two clubs agreed a fee for the player, it was the fourth bid Norwich had made for Morison. He signed for the club on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee on 6 June. Morison made his Norwich City debut against Wigan Athletic during the club's first game of the 2011–12 campaign, playing 75 minutes of the match in a 1–1 draw. He was crucial in Norwich's equalising goal, beating Adrián López Rodríguez on the right wing and providing a cross that was ultimately turned in by Wes Hoolahan. He scored his first goal for the club in Norwich's first home win of the season, a 2–1 victory against Sunderland on 26 September. The goal came shortly after half-time, with Morison heading in Marc Tierney's cross to give Norwich a two-goal lead. Morison scored his second goal for Norwich in a 3–3 draw against Blackburn Rovers on 29 October, with the goal being described as a [...] "stunning strike" [...] {{from the edge of the}} area. A week later, he scored a header from an acute angle in Norwich's 3–2 away defeat against Aston Villa. Morison's fourth goal of the campaign came in a 2–1 home defeat to Arsenal on 19 November, scoring the opening goal of the game after he stole the ball from Per Mertesacker before calmly beating Wojciech Szczęsny in the Arsenal goal. He scored his fourth goal in five Premier League appearances on 3 December, beating Gaël Clichy at the back post to powerfully head the ball past Joe Hart in the Manchester City goal. Morison's goal was a minor consolation in a 5–1 defeat at the City of Manchester Stadium. Morison was also on target for the Canaries in the club's 4–2 home win over Newcastle United on 10 December, scoring Norwich's third goal when he powerfully headed in Andrew Crofts' cross from 12-yards out. He scored in Norwich's first three games of 2012 despite featuring as a substitute in two of the matches, scoring once in the FA Cup in a 4–1 victory over Burnley, as well as netting late goals in 2–1 away victories against Queens Park Rangers and West Bromwich Albion respectively. After his goal at West Brom, Morison did not find the scoresheet for another three months [...] – eventually scoring his tenth goal of the campaign in a 3–3 draw away to Arsenal at Emirates Stadium on 5 May 2012. Morison's late strike from a tight angle drew Norwich level after they had trailed 3–2 with five minutes remaining. During his first season at the club, he scored ten goals in 37 appearances.|$|E

For someone like me who devoured American cinema of the early 70s, tearing up at films like Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be the best judge. Who knows, Heaven's Door may become the new Léon for the teen set here and regarded as a minor indie classic overseas." ...|$|E

2500|$|At age eight, Crosby {{wrote her}} first poem which {{described}} her condition. She later remarked: [...] "It seemed intended by the blessed providence of God that I should be blind all my life, and I {{thank him for}} the dispensation. If perfect earthly sight were offered me tomorrow I would not accept it. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have sung hymns to the praise of God if I had been distracted by the beautiful and interesting things about me." [...] She also once said, [...] "when I get to heaven, the first face that shall ever gladden my sight will be that of my Savior". According to biographer Annie Willis, [...] "had {{it not been for}} her affliction she might not have so good an education or have so great an influence, and certainly not so fine a memory".|$|E
2500|$|Drummer Tony Williams was {{an early}} influence. [...] "The first drummer I ever saw, where I got to feel the impact up close, was Tony Williams", Blackman said. [...] "When I was 16, Tony came to my local drum store with a bassist and did a [...] clinic that left a {{powerful}} impression on me. And that's what I thought drumming should be: drummers should {{have a lot of}} impact and a great sound, without being limited to a conventional role in the band—the drums should speak just as freely as anybody." [...] Blackman says that the way that Williams used all four limbs to attack the drums strongly influenced her. [...] "I just love and loved everything about Tony", says Blackman. [...] "To me, not only was he a master technician, a master drummer, the innovator of the age, but also, he was a sound innovator. He had so many things that elevated the sound and the level of skill required to play this kind of music." [...] But although Blackman is sometimes referred to as a disciple of Tony Williams, she follows her own path. [...] "On the one hand, it doesn't bother me at all to be associated and in line with a master of the instrument like that – Okay, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be where I want to be, but I'm on the right track", says Blackman. [...] "On the other hand, I don't plan on being a clone. What I'm doing is always looking to expound on something that he's done, or push the music in a different way".|$|E
2500|$|As {{production}} went on, {{the slow}} pace and daily mental and physical strain of filming began to wear on the cast and crew. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio remembered, [...] "We never started and finished any one scene in any one day". At one point, Cameron told the actors to relieve themselves in their wetsuits to save time between takes. While filming one of many takes of Mastrantonio's character's resuscitation scene- {{in which she was}} soaking wet, topless and repeatedly being slapped and pounded on the chest- the camera ran out of film, prompting Mastrantonio to storm off the set yelling, [...] "We are not animals!" [...] For some shots in the scene that focus on Ed Harris, he was yelling at thin air because Mastrantonio refused to film the scene again. Michael Biehn also grew frustrated by the waiting. He claimed that he was in South Carolina for five months and only acted for three to four weeks. He remembered one day being ten meters underwater and [...] "suddenly the lights went out. It was so black I couldn't see my hand. I couldn't surface. I realized <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> get out of there." [...] Harris recalled: [...] "One day we were all in our dressing rooms and people began throwing couches out the windows and smashing the walls. We just had to get our frustrations out." [...] Cameron responded to these complaints, saying, [...] "For every hour they spent {{trying to figure out what}} magazine to read, we spent an hour at the bottom of the tank breathing compressed air." [...] After 140 days and $4 million over budget, filming finally wrapped on December 8, 1988. Before the film's release, there were reports from South Carolina that Ed Harris was so upset by the physical demands of the film and Cameron's dictatorial directing style that he said he would refuse to help promote the motion picture. Harris later denied this rumor and helped promote the film. But after its release and initial promotion, Harris publicly refused to ever again discuss the film, saying [...] "I'm never talking about it and never will." [...] Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio has also since brushed off the film, commenting, [...] "The Abyss was a lot of things. Fun to make is not one of them." ...|$|E

But, Miss Summerson! Angel! No, don't ring--I have been {{brought up in a}} sharp school and am accustomed to a variety of general practice.
