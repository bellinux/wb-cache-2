5|$|During the 19th century, strombid {{gastropods}} {{were believed}} to be carnivores. This erroneous conception was based on the writings of French naturalist Jean Baptiste Lamarck, whose classification scheme grouped strombids with carnivorous sea snails. Subsequent studies have refuted the concept, proving beyond doubt that strombid gastropods are herbivorous animals. In common with other Strombidae, Laevistrombus canarium <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a herbivore, feeding on algae and occasionally detritus.|$|E

5|$|Amanita muscaria {{contains}} several biologically active agents, {{at least}} one of which, muscimol, <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> psychoactive. Ibotenic acid, a neurotoxin, serves as a prodrug to muscimol, with approximately 10–20% converting to muscimol after ingestion. An active dose in adults is approximately 6mg muscimol or 30 to 60mg ibotenic acid; this is typically about the amount found in one cap of Amanita muscaria. The amount and ratio of chemical compounds per mushroom varies widely from region to region and season to season, which can further confuse the issue. Spring and summer mushrooms have been reported to contain up to 10 times more ibotenic acid and muscimol than autumn fruitings.|$|E
5|$|An {{off-season}} Atlantic hurricane is {{a recorded}} tropical or subtropical cyclone {{that existed in}} the Atlantic basin outside of the official Atlantic hurricane season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration currently defines the season as occurring between June 1 and November 30 each calendar year, which is when 97% of all Atlantic tropical cyclones occur. Peak activity <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> between August and October. In the off-season, storms are most likely to occur in May, with approximately 60% of such storms occurring during that month. Occasionally, however, storms develop in or persist until December. As of , there have been 81 off-season cyclones in the Atlantic hurricane database, which began in 1851. In addition, there were six storms before 1851, and one hurricane in 1863 that {{is not part of the}} official database.|$|E

Both the dire wolf and the Beringian wolf went extinct in North America, leaving only the less carnivorous and more gracile form of the wolf to thrive, which may have outcompeted the dire wolf. Dire wolf remains having the youngest geological ages are dated at 9,440YBP at Brynjulfson Cave, Boone County, Missouri, 9,860YBP at Rancho La Brea, California, and 10,690YBP at La Mirada, California. Dire wolf remains have been radiocarbon dated to 8,200YBP from Whitewater Draw in Arizona, However, one author has stated that radiocarbon dating of bone carbonate <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unreliable, and that while many dire wolf remains are found in fossil assemblages dated to the terminal Pleistocene, there are no confirmed Holocene finds.|$|E
