30|$|Since 1997, we prospectively {{assessed}} in an Excel file all consecutive patients referred {{to us for}} the treatment of endometriosis with suspicious of intestinal involvement {{because of the presence of}} a rectovaginal nodule and/or because of the severity of the <b>dyschesia</b> with abdominal bloating and cyclical rectorraghia or at last because of a previous laparoscopy.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Levator plate sagging (LPS), {{usually called}} {{descending}} perineum syndrome, {{is one of}} the main defects encountered in perineology. This defect is classically associated with colo-proctologic functional troubles (<b>dyschesia</b> and anal incontinence) but can also induce perineodynia, gynaecological and lower urinary tract symptoms. Methods A retrospective case series of nine female patients (mean age: 44. 3) underwent an isolated retro-anal levator plate myorrhaphy (RLPM) to treat symptomatic LPS confirmed by rectal examination and/or Perineocaliper ®. An anti-sagging test (support of the posterior perineum) must significantly improve the symptoms that were resistant to conservative treatment. The effect of the procedure on the symptoms of the 3 axes of the perineum (urological, colo-proctologic and gynecological) and on perineodynia was evaluated during a follow up consultation more than 9 months after surgery. The effect of RLPM on the position of the anal margin and on the levator plate angle was studied using rectal examination, Perineocaliper ® and retro-anal ultrasound. Results Before surgery, anti-sagging tests were positive for <b>dyschesia,</b> urinary urgency and pain. After a mean follow-up of 16. 1 months, RLPM resolved or improved 2 / 2 cases of stress urinary incontinence, 3 / 5 of urinary urgency, 3 / 4 of dysuria, 3 / 3 of anal incontinence, 7 / 8 of <b>dyschesia,</b> 3 / 4 of cystocele, 4 / 5 of rectocele, 5 / 8 of dyspareunia and 6 / 7 of perineodynia. Rectal examination showed a complete suppression of sagging in 4 patients and an improvement in the 5 others. The mean reduction of perineal descent was 1. 08 cm (extremes: 0 – 1. 5). Using retro-anal ultrasound of the levator plate, the mean reduction of sagging was 12. 67 degrees (extremes: 1 – 21). Conclusion Anti-sagging tests can be used before surgery to simulate the effect of RLPM. This surgical procedure seems to improve stress urinary incontinence, frequency, nocturia, urgency, dysuria, anal incontinence, <b>dyschesia,</b> dyspareunia, perineodynia, cystocele and rectocele. These results must be confirmed by a larger case series. </p...|$|E
30|$|Introduction: Surgery {{for deep}} infiltrating endometriosis {{treatment}} (DIE) remain very actual topic. Chronic pelvic pain syndrome, dyspareunia, <b>dyschesia,</b> nodular infiltration of pararectal fat, intestinal lesions wich lead to stenosis require radical treatment. Radical operations lead to traumatization and postcoagulative peritoneal necrosis that aggravate postoperative period {{and leads to}} adhesions, intestinal paresis. Improvement of surgical treatment with help of new types of energy could possibly reduce these negative consequences and will lead to better reproductive results.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} clinical {{articles published}} in the past 30 years using the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory of the lung being connected with large intestine to treat intestinal diseases. We also analyzed the relationship between symptoms, drugs and therapies with data-excavating technology to aid management. MethodsAfter retrieving relevant clinical articles, {{we set up a}} database, used Microsoft Structured Query Language Server 2005 Analysis Services as a data-excavating tool, and applied the association rule to study the relationship between the symptoms, drugs and therapies of intestinal diseases. ResultsThe key symptoms of <b>dyschesia,</b> constipation, abdominal fullness, fatigue and pale tongue could be treated with Kuxingren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum), Huangqi (Radix Astragali Mongolici) and Gualou (Fructus et Semen Trichosanthis) to invigorate Qi and moisten the intestine. Among these agents, Kuxingren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum) was used most frequently. Clearing Fu-organs was the most prevalent therapy for abdominal fullness, <b>dyschesia,</b> constipation and red tongue. Clearing Fu-organs could be achieved with Kuxingren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum) and Gualou (Fructus et Semen Trichosanthis), whereas Qi could be invigorated using Huangqi (Radix Astragali Mongolici), Gancao (Radix Glycyrrhizae), Baizhu (Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae) and Kuxingren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum). Moistening the intestine was possible with Kuxingren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum), Huomaren (Fructus Cannabis) and Jiegeng (Radix Platycodi). Also, moistening the lungs was done with Kuxingren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum), ventilating the lungs with Kuxingren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum) and Gualou (Fructus et Semen Trichosanthis), and nourishing the lungs with Huangqi (Radix Astragali Mongolici), Gancao (Radix Glycyrrhizae) and Kuxingren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum). These data demonstrated that Kuxingren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum) was a key agent. ConclusionOur analyses of the literature showed clear relationships between symptoms (constipation, <b>dyschesia,</b> abdominal fullness), drugs [Gualou (Fructus et Semen Trichosanthis), Kuxingren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum), Huangqi (Radix Astragali Mongolici) ] and therapies (moistening the intestine, clearing Fu-organs, invigorating Qi, ventilating the lungs) ...|$|E
30|$|All {{patients}} underwent meticulous preoperative anamnesis and examination {{focusing on}} previous history, type {{and location of}} the pain, functional intestinal disorders including <b>dyschesia,</b> rectal pain, cyclical and noncyclical rectal bleeding, tenesmus, and diarrhea, and at last the classical symptoms of endometriosis such as dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia or apareunia, or infertility. During preoperative clinical examination and colposcopy, particular {{attention was paid to}} presence of a deep infiltrating endometriosis of the posterior fornix or rectovaginal space or of the uterine parametria.|$|E
30|$|A 36 -year-old lady {{presented}} with a 2 -year history of painful defaecation and a painful nodular swelling in the posterior vaginal wall that increased in size prior to and during menstruation. She had no other pelvic pain, notably no dysmenorrhea or dyspareunia, but did have <b>dyschesia</b> when the nodule was enlarged. Her menstrual cycle was normal with a regular 28 -day cycle. Previously, she had had two term deliveries, one by caesarean section and the other by vaginal delivery.|$|E
30|$|During the study, we {{observed}} also that {{in patients with}} a clinical rectovaginal endometriosis founded by the vaginal palpation (n[*]=[*] 702) added {{to the presence of}} cyclical <b>dyschesia,</b> abdominal bloating and tenesmus with a normal bowel function during the menstrual cycle, and apparition of a constipation {{at the beginning of the}} period followed 2 to 3  days later by a diarrhea was correlated in 78.2 % with a deep infiltration of the rectosigmoide required bowel surgery (n[*]=[*] 201). The combination of these mentioned symptoms with an apareunia shows then a positive predictive value for bowel infiltration of 95 %.|$|E
30|$|Methods: Prospective {{study of}} {{patients}} referred to pelvic pain clinic. Patients with symptoms including dysmenorrhoea, dysparunia, <b>dyschesia</b> and pelvic pain {{were invited to}} take part in the study. They had a vaginal examination (VE) and a transvaginal scan (TVS) performed by the gynaecologists. The findings of the VE and TVS were recorded. The patients were counseled for the appropriate operation and returned to have the operation weeks later. At the time of the operation the findings of pelvis were recorded in a separate sheet. The findings of the VE and TVS were then compared with the gold standard of laparoscopic and histological findings.|$|E
30|$|All women {{presenting}} to the gynaecology {{outpatient clinic}} {{with a history}} of pelvic pain, dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia, and <b>dyschesia</b> suggestive of endometriosis or who had previously been diagnosed as having the disease were asked to enter the trial. All women who were less than 16  years of age, pregnant, or subfertile were excluded from the study. Power studies were performed prior to the study, and 25 patients were required in each arm. However, only one in three women who were asked to enter the trial agreed because two in three wished to have surgical therapy if they were diagnosed with endometriosis. A total of 35 women between September 1999 and March 2001 were recruited for this study.|$|E
30|$|After {{correlation}} of the preoperatively collected data with the intraoperative findings, we focused {{our attention on}} the positive predictive value of the different symptoms predicting a rectum and/or a sigmoide infiltration requiring bowel surgery: no single symptom offered a positive predictive value exceeding 70 %. However, the positive predictive value for the bowel symptoms differed completely depending on the presence or not of an infiltrative endometriosis of the rectovaginal space. Abdominal bloating and <b>dyschesia</b> show, respectively, a positive predictive value for intestinal infiltration of 84 % and 79 % when a endometriotic nodule was palped in the posterior fornix while {{in the absence of}} a rectovaginal infiltration, these values fell to 3.2 % and 2.8 %, respectively. A apareunia present a positive predictive value for endometriosis of the rectovaginal space and/or for uterine retroversion or retroflexio of 92 %.|$|E
30|$|Results: We {{classified}} {{the operative}} findings into five groups of superficial endometriosis, deep sidewall disease, endometrioma, rectovaginal disease + endometrioma and deep sidewall disease + endometrioma which comprised of 54 (28 %), 61 (31 %), 13 (6 %), 19 (22 %), 43 (22 %) subjects {{in each group}} respectively. No significant correlation {{was found between the}} preoperative questionnaire scores and the rASRM score (Spearman’s rho p[*]>[*] 0.05). In addition, no significant associations was observed between severity of the disease according rASRM stage or our new classification categories (Kruskal Wallis Test, df[*]=[*] 3, p[*]>[*] 0.05) and the preoperative questionnaires. We also analysed the degree of correlation between anatomical localizations of disease and pain types (Kendall’s tau-b). The most significant correlations were those of dyspareunia, dysmenorrhoea and <b>dyschesia</b> where the disease location was uterosacral ligament (p[*]=[*] 0.001), right uterosacral ligament (p[*]=[*] 0.009) and pararectal area (p[*]=[*] 0.003) respectively.|$|E
40|$|Fractures of {{the pelvis}} are common {{and may be}} {{accompanied}} by injuries to vital structures. Conservative treatment or surgery is usually recommended. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the consequences of pelvic trauma in dogs and the results of clinical and surgical treatment. Twenty animals with fracture of the pelvis were used. The treatment, surgical or conservative, was primarily based on the type of fracture, extent of injuries and resources availability. 85 % of the animals showed iliac fracture; 80 % of the cases were bilateral pelvicfracture, and concurrent disorders, such as skin lesions, <b>dyschesia,</b> limb and column fracture, colon, urinary tract or diaphragm rupture, head trauma and death, were observed. In patients who underwent surgery there was recovery of ambulation, with full recovery after 90 days. This result was not repeated in patients which underwent conservative treatment. The surgical stabilization of bone segments provided clear pain reduction after seven days, increasing life quality and reducing the need for nursing, while 55 % of the animals that were not operated died and other two had to be operated to correct complications as a result of the lack of previous surgical correction. The results indicate that, in dogs with pelvic trauma, surgical resolution should be primarily sought, and the presence ofother concomitant organic disabling injuries or with the potential to lead to death should be verified...|$|E
30|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to isolate from the {{clinical}} history and examination, symptoms, or combination of symptoms highly suspicious for intestinal infiltration in endometriosis patients. In a prospective study, preoperative anamnesis on defecation problems and pain symptoms was correlated with the vaginal examination and the laparoscopic findings in 2, 000 consecutive patients with suspicion of intestinal endometriosis; 65.7 % of the patients reported a typical symptomatology combining left-sided pelvic pain irradiating systematically to the back and occasionally to the left leg, with <b>dyschesia,</b> abdominal bloating, and/or sensation of a doubt masse in the left lower or middle abdomen, sometimes rectorrhagia and an improvement in the pain after defecation. In the absence of a palpable endometriotic nodule of the rectovaginal space, the combination of this symptoms correlated in 93.7 % of the patients with an outlet constipation syndrome due to a significant elongation with kinking of the rectosigmoide. In the patients with a palpable endometriotic nodule of the posterior fornix (n[*]=[*] 712), the combination of an apareunia with the apparition of constipation for 2 – 3  days at the beginning of the period bleeding followed by a diarrhea until the end of the period shows a positive predictive value for deep intestinal infiltration of 95 %. In all endometriosis patients undergoing a laparoscopy for pain and intestinal disorders, the elongation of the rectosigmoide must be perceived and recognized as a potential cause for an outlet constipation syndrome which can be cured easily by a left-sided sigmoidopexy. In patients with a macroscopic endometriotic nodule of the posterior fornix, the presence of an apareunia and the apparition of constipation at the beginning of the menstruation followed 2 – 3  days later by a diarrhea are strong arguments for an invasive intestinal endometriosis, and those patients must be primarily referred to a tertiary referral center.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Perineodynia (vulvodynia, perineal pain, proctalgia), anal and urinary {{incontinence}} {{are the main}} symptoms of the pudendal canal syndrome (PCS) or entrapment of the pudendal nerve. The first {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of bilateral pudendal nerve decompression (PND) on the symptoms of the PCS, on three clinical signs (abnormal sensibility, painful Alcock's canal, painful "skin rolling test") and on two neurophysiological tests: electromyography (EMG) and pudendal nerve terminal motor latencies (PNTML). The second aim was to study the clinical value of the aforementioned clinical signs in the diagnosis of PCS. Methods In this retrospective analysis, the studied sample comprised 74 female patients who underwent a bilateral PND between 1995 and 2002. To accomplish the first aim, the patients sample was compared before and at least one year after surgery by means of descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing. The second aim was achieved by means of a statistical comparison between the patient's group before the operation and a control group of 82 women without any of the following signs: prolapse, anal incontinence, perineodynia, <b>dyschesia</b> and history of pelvi-perineal surgery. Results When bilateral PND was the only procedure done to treat the symptoms, the cure rates of perineodynia, anal incontinence and {{urinary incontinence}} were 8 / 14, 4 / 5 and 3 / 5, respectively. The frequency of the three clinical signs was significantly reduced. There was a significant reduction of anal and perineal PNTML and a significant increase of anal richness on EMG. The Odd Ratio of the three clinical signs in the diagnosis of PCS was 16, 97 (95 % CI = 4, 68 – 61, 51). Conclusion This study suggests that bilateral PND can treat perineodynia, anal and urinary incontinence. The three clinical signs of PCS seem to be efficient to suspect this diagnosis. There is a need for further studies to confirm these preliminary results. </p...|$|E
