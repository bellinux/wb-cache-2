Inspection of the engines revealed that the right engine had consistently been developing up to five percent more torque than the left engine, {{as a result of}} a defective right engine <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> and pressure sensor.

At eight seconds before impact the right engine reached a minimum of zero torque while the left engine reached −9 percent torque (which means the left propeller was driving the engine instead of the engine driving the propeller).

50|$|Because {{pressure}} and temperature are strongly linked, knock {{can also be}} attenuated by controlling peak combustion chamber temperatures by compression ratio reduction, exhaust gas recirculation, appropriate calibration of the engine's ignition timing schedule, and careful design of the engine's combustion chambers and cooling system as well as controlling the initial <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>temperature.</b>|$|R

5000|$|An intercooler, or [...] "Charge-Air Cooler", is an air-to-air or air-to-liquid heat {{exchange}} device used on turbocharged and supercharged (forced induction) internal combustion engines {{to improve their}} volumetric efficiency by increasing intake air-charge density through isochoric cooling. A decrease in <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>temperature</b> provides a denser intake charge to the engine and allows more air and fuel to be combusted per engine cycle, increasing {{the output of the}} engine.|$|R
50|$|The {{difference}} between the exhaust and intake pressures and temperatures means that some increase in efficiency can be gained by use of a turbocharger, removing from the exhaust flow {{some part of the}} remaining energy and transferring that to the intake flow to increase the intake pressure. A gas turbine can extract useful work energy from the exhaust stream and that can then be used to pressurize the <b>intake</b> <b>air.</b> The pressure and temperature of the exhausting gases would be reduced as they expand through the gas turbine and that work is then applied to the intake gas stream, increasing its pressure and temperature. The transfer of energy amounts to an efficiency improvement and the resulting power density of the engine is also improved. The <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> is typically cooled so as to reduce its volume as the work produced per stroke is a direct function of the amount of mass taken into the cylinder; denser air will produce more work per cycle. Practically speaking the <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> mass <b>temperature</b> must also be reduced to prevent premature ignition in a petrol fueled engine; hence, an intercooler is used to remove some energy as heat and so reduce the intake temperature. Such a scheme both increases the engine's efficiency and power density.|$|R

5000|$|The computer, in 1993, was run via Speed Density, which {{measured}} {{engine speed}} (RPM) and load (MAP in kPa) to compute airflow requirements {{and then use}} that against the VE table to get the proper fueling for conditions. An IAT (<b>Intake</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Temperature</b> sensor) was also used as air density changes with temperature. In 1994 however, the computer logic was changed over to a Mass Air Flow system. This system uses a Mass Air Flow Sensor {{placed in front of}} the throttle body to measure the incoming airflow into the motor. This is measured by using a heated wire in the sensor in the airstream path which has heat pulled away from it via the incoming air. This reduced heat is converted into a voltage signal which is sent to the PCM which then converts that voltage signal into mass flow. The computer uses engine sensors to judge engine conditions and provide the proper fueling off of this mass airflow reading. This {{was one of the main}} differences between the 93 and 94+ F-Body cars (and 92-93 Vette's compared to 94-96) and one of the items that makes a 93 model unique. Another prominent difference between the [...] "Speed Density" [...] 93's and the 94+ cars is how the programming (or custom tuning) of the computer takes place. In 1993, the stock computer uses a Memcal chip, which is a removable chip from the computer. Contained in this chip is the program for the car to run. In the 1994+ cars, this was swapped to a non-removable reflashable chip, which could be reprogrammed via the Assembly Line Diagnostic Link, or ALDL, located underneath the driver side of the dash, next to the center console. Many people view this as a more user-friendly and easier way to tune the vehicle.|$|E
40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{was constructed}} to investigate what effects could be generated in an HCCI engine by altering {{the properties of}} the engine?s intake charge. The principle changes investigated were altering the spatial distribution of the fuel in the intake and adding thermal gradients to the charge. The primary goal of the work was to develop a method to separate the effects of the spatial stratification of the charge from the effects of the thermal gradients in the charge and to study both independently. The laboratory included faculties for measuring the exhaust emissions, recording cylinder pressure, and monitoring and controlling the many engine inlet and outlet parameters. Auto-ignition state was achieved by externally adding thermal energy to the intake charge utilizing heaters wrapped around the intake piping, this allowed us to generate an intake charge with a very uniform temperature distribution unlike an engine that uses exhaust rebreathing or recompression strategies. Intake temperatures in excess of 350 �C were achievable in this laboratory. Two fueling systems were developed for this work. One was located over two meters away from the inlet to enable thorough mixing and a homogeneous mixture. The other utilized the traditional fueling port to introduce a concentrated shot of fuel and keep it separated from the air as long as possible in order to minimize mixing. In order to separate the thermal and the spatial effects the fuel was heated up to the same temperature as the bulk of the inlet air. The goal was to ensure that the charge in the cylinder started the compression process with a known and controlled temperature. The level of stratification was controlled by manipulating the timing of the injection of the fuel. The results of these experiments validated the experimental setup and confirmed that consistent and repeatable results could be obtained. A series of experiments performed with spatial stratification of the fuel, as well as thermal stratification in the charge, showed that increasing thermal stratification shifted the window of acceptable intake temperatures, over which combustion could be achieved, to higher temperatures. The engine also emitted higher levels of NOx and CO as the stratification increased, but all other indicators were constant when reviewed {{as a function of the}} combustion efficiency. In this setup the premixed fueling system had the lowest window of <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> and generated the lowest pollutant emissions. A set of experiments conducted with only stratification of the fuel showed that the engine operated over the same set of <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> for both fueling methods and for all injection timings investigated. In these experiments the engine still emitted higher amounts of NOx and CO compared to the premixed system, but these emissions were lower in this setup than they were in the setup that also introduced thermal stratification. The spatial stratification did not alter the engine?s behavior, in terms of cylinder pressure. Over a range of speeds, air/fuel ratios, and fueling rates the effects of fuel stratification, generated in the intake system, only caused slight increases in the emissions of NOx and CO. While empirical evidence leads to the conclusion that stratification of the fuel does exist inside the cylinder, the results do not provide any evidence as to what level of stratification is actually generated. However, an optically accessible engine has been constructed and installed in the laboratory and will be used, in the near future, to quantify the level of stratification generated...|$|R
40|$|Direct Fuel Injection (DI) extends {{engine knock}} limits {{compared}} to Port Fuel Injection (PFI) by utilizing the in-cylinder charge cooling effect due to fuel evaporation. The use of gasoline/ethanol blends in DI is therefore especially advantageous {{due to the}} high heat of vaporization of ethanol. Additionally ethanol blends also display superior chemical resistance to auto-ignition, therefore allowing the further extension of knock limits. An engine with both DI and port fuel injection (PFI) was used to obtain knock onset limits for five gasoline/ethanol blends and different <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Using PFI as a baseline, the amount the <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> needed to be heated in DI to knock at the same conditions as PFI is the effective charge cooling realized and ranges from ~ 14 °C for gasoline to ~ 49 °C for E 85. The Livengood-Wu auto-ignition integral {{in conjunction with the}} Douad-Eyzat time to auto-ignition correlation was used to predict knock onset. The preexponential factor in the correlation was varied to fit the experimental data. An "Effective Octane Number-ONEFF" is thus obtained for every blend ranging from 97 ONEFF. for gasoline to 115 ONEFF. for E 85. ONEFF. captures the chemistry effect on knock and shows that there is little antiknock benefit beyond 30 - 40 % ethanol by volume unless the fuel is used in a DI engine. Using this approach, the anti-knock benefit of charge cooling can also be quantified as an octane number. To achieve that, the ONEFF. calculated for an actual DI operating point including charge cooling effects is compared to the ONEFF. obtained from the auto-ignition integral if the unburned mixture temperature is offset to cancel the charge cooling out. The resulting increase in ONEFF., which can be viewed as an "Evaporative Octane Number" ranges from 5 ONEFF. for gasoline to 18 ONEFF. for E 85. by Emmanuel P. Kasseris. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Hydrogen {{has been}} largely {{proposed}} as a possible alternative fuel for internal combustion engines. Its wide flammability range allows higher engine efficiency with leaner operation than conventional fuels, for both reduced toxic emissions and no CO 2 gases. Independently, Homogenous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) also allows higher thermal efficiency and lower fuel consumption with reduced NOX emissions when compared to Spark-Ignition (SI) engine operation. For HCCI combustion, a mixture of air and fuel is supplied to the cylinder and autoignition occurs from compression; engine is operated throttle-less and load {{is controlled by the}} quality of the mixture, avoiding the large fluid-dynamic losses in the intake manifold of SI engines. HCCI can be induced and controlled by varying the mixture temperature, either by Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) or <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> pre-heating. A combination of HCCI combustion with hydrogen fuelling has great potential for virtually zero CO 2 and NOX emissions. Nevertheless, combustion on such a fast burning fuel with wide flammability limits and high octane number implies many disadvantages, such as control of backfiring and speed of autoignition and there is almost no literature on the subject, particularly in optical engines. Experiments were conducted in a single-cylinder research engine equipped with both Port Fuel Injection (PFI) and Direct Injection (DI) systems running at 1000 RPM. Optical access to in-cylinder phenomena was enabled through an extended piston and optical crown. Combustion images were acquired by a high-speed camera at 1 °or 2 °crank angle resolution for a series of engine cycles. Spark-ignition tests were initially carried out to benchmark the operation of the engine with hydrogen against gasoline. DI of hydrogen after intake valve closure was found to be preferable in order to overcome problems related to backfiring and air displacement from hydrogens low density. HCCI combustion of hydrogen was initially enabled by means of a pilot port injection of n-heptane preceding the main direct injection of hydrogen, along with <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> preheating. Sole hydrogen fuelling HCCI was finally achieved and made sustainable, even at the low compression ratio of the optical engine by means of closed-valve DI, in synergy with air-pre-heating and negative valve overlap to promote internal EGR.
