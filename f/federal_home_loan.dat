5|$|The Keating Five {{were five}} United States Senators accused of {{corruption}} in 1989, igniting a major political scandal {{as part of the}} larger Savings and Loan crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The five senators – Alan Cranston (Democrat of California), Dennis DeConcini (Democrat of Arizona), John Glenn (Democrat of Ohio), John McCain (Republican of Arizona), and Donald W. Riegle, Jr. (Democrat of Michigan) – were accused of improperly intervening in 1987 on behalf of Charles H. Keating, Jr., Chairman of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, which was the target of a regulatory investigation by the <b>Federal</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Loan</b> Bank Board (FHLBB). The FHLBB subsequently backed off taking action against Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|Miskovsky {{left the}} CIA in 1964, {{and worked for}} the Federal Maritime Commission and the Treasury Department for four years. In 1967, Miskovsky was {{appointed}} to lead an investigation concerning the 1967 Detroit riot for the Kerner Commission. During the investigation, Miskovsky interviewed civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King, Jr. Miskovsky's report concluded that the United States was transitioning into two separate societies, one black and the other white, and that the societies were inherently unequal. In 1968, Miskovsky was appointed the director of Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, an organization which gave legal aid to those whose civil liberties were violated. From 1977 to 1981, during the administration of President Jimmy Carter, Miskovsky served as {{general counsel for the}} <b>Federal</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Loan</b> Bank Board.|$|E

50|$|In the US, {{these changes}} can be {{attributed}} to real-estate developers' desire to meet FHA guidelines and make <b>federal</b> <b>home</b> <b>loans</b> available to their consumers. In Canada a similar incentive was provided to developers by CMHC. These incentives, which were discontinued in the 1970s, gave the initial impetus for the application of the hierarchical pattern. In other countries such incentives do not exist and its adoption is motivated by consumer preferences.|$|R

5|$|McCain {{testified against}} Keating {{in a civil}} suit brought by Lincoln bondholders, and {{was seen as the}} plaintiffs' best witness. The other four {{senators}} refused to testify. Cranston left office in January 1993, and died in December 2000. DeConcini and Riegle continued to serve in the Senate until their terms expired, but they did not seek re-election in 1994. DeConcini was appointed by President Bill Clinton in February 1995 to the Board of Directors of the <b>Federal</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Loan</b> Mortgage Corporation. Glenn did choose to run for re-election in 1992, trying to become the first senator ever to win a fourth term from Ohio. The Republican candidate, Lieutenant Governor R. Michael DeWine, attacked Glenn on Keating Five {{as well as a number}} of other matters, in one of the dirtiest campaigns in the country that year and the toughest of Glenn's senatorial contests. Glenn prevailed, however, defeating DeWine by nine percentage points to gain one more term in the Senate before retiring and not running for re-election in 1998.|$|E

50|$|In 1931 Goldseker founded M. Goldseker Real Estate Company {{which was}} located at 218 West Franklin Street in {{downtown}} Baltimore. This remained his office for over forty years. His company managed thousands {{of real estate}} properties. During the economic downturn of the depression, Goldseker knew that foreclosures were imminent. He asked lending institutions if he could manage the properties that were in foreclosure. He then purchased the foreclosed homes he managed, paying off the properties {{in which he was}} the note holder, acquiring the reputation of a good risk with savings and loans institutions and banks. The Baltimore City Government agreed to let him manage 1400 city properties that were in disrepair or needed management services.

5000|$|Appointed by Frances Perkins as {{chairman}} of the New York State Committee on the Stabilization of Industry in 1930, Bruère worked on projects which presaged the National Recovery Administration’s concept of government-led organization of industry. During the New Deal, Bruère also became a “Dollar-a-Year” Man for President Franklin Roosevelt by serving on the President’s <b>Federal</b> <b>Home</b> Owners <b>Loan</b> Corporation and Federal Credit Association. [...] He assisted with reforms implementing unemployment and old-age insurance systems, and was an advisor to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Bruère also became executive assistant to William Woodin, Roosevelt's first Secretary of the Treasury. While at the White House, he was on the media communications team which proposed the “Fireside Chat” between the President and the American people, via a new medium called ‘radio’. During the Second World War Bruère used his position as a Manhattan banker to coordinate relief committees for the people of France and Britain. Between 1951 and 1953, Henry Bruère was President, National Civic League, succeeding Charles Edison, son of Thomas Edison. George Gallup was elected president after Mr. Bruère. During the post-War period, Bruère returned to civic issues. As president of the Bowery Savings Bank, he worked to overcome the housing shortage in New York City and its boroughs. When Robert Moses’ Brooklyn Civic Center and an adjacent Concord Village were approaching double the estimated cost, local leaders looked to Bruère to provide a solution.|$|R
40|$|The paper explores {{major reasons}} for recent {{proliferation}} {{in a number}} of <b>home</b> <b>loan</b> products, and provides a classification and detailed account of various contemporary <b>home</b> <b>loan</b> products and packages offered in Australia. The following series of categories are used to facilitate discussion: type of offering, major functionality, major purpose, distribution segment, interest structure and conformation status. Among other things, the large number of <b>home</b> <b>loan</b> products, a significant variation in <b>home</b> <b>loan</b> products world wide, recent dynamic changes in the <b>home</b> <b>loan</b> market and the number of different ways in which <b>home</b> <b>loan</b> products can be grouped and viewed, make it difficult to exhaustively categorise <b>home</b> <b>loan</b> products. The <b>home</b> <b>loan</b> classification presented results from the author’s attempt to overcome this difficulty. As much as the author is aware, {{this is the first time}} that an exhaustive series of classifications of <b>home</b> <b>loan</b> products has been compiled. Finally, it is important to note that many of the findings in this study are derived from a number of different sources, including the author’s extensive experience in the industry...|$|R

25|$|This is {{sometimes}} called a loan policy and it is issued only to mortgage lenders. Generally speaking, it follows the assignment of the mortgage loan, meaning that the policy benefits the purchaser of the loan if the loan is sold. For this reason, these policies greatly facilitate the sale of mortgages into the secondary market. That market {{is made up of}} high volume purchasers such as Fannie Mae and the <b>Federal</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Loan</b> Mortgage Corporation as well as private institutions.|$|E
25|$|Homeownership {{has been}} {{promoted}} as government policy using several means involving mortgage debt and the government sponsored entities Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and the <b>Federal</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Loan</b> Banks, which fund or guarantee $6.5 trillion of assets {{with the purpose of}} directly or indirectly promoting homeownership. Homeownership has been further promoted through tax policy which allows a tax deduction for mortgage interest payments on a primary residence. The Community Reinvestment Act also encourages homeownership for low-income earners. The promotion of homeownership by the government through encouraging mortgage borrowing and lending has given rise to debates regarding government policies and the subprime mortgage crisis.|$|E

25|$|Fannie stock plunged. Some {{worried that}} Fannie lacked capital and might go bankrupt. Others {{worried about a}} {{government}} seizure. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson {{as well as the}} White House went on the air to defend the financial soundness of Fannie Mae, in a last-ditch effort to prevent a total financial panic. Fannie and Freddie underpinned the whole U.S. mortgage market. As recently as 2008, Fannie Mae and the <b>Federal</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Loan</b> Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) had owned or guaranteed about half of the U.S.'s $12 trillion mortgage market. If they were to collapse, mortgages would be harder to obtain and much more expensive. Fannie and Freddie bonds were owned by everyone from the Chinese Government, to money market funds, to the retirement funds of hundreds of millions of people. If they went bankrupt there would be mass upheaval on a global scale.|$|E
25|$|The {{damage to}} S {{operations}} led Congress to act, passing the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA) in August 1981 and initiating the regulatory changes by the <b>Federal</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Loan</b> Bank Board allowing S {{to sell their}} mortgage loans and use the cash generated to seek better returns soon after enactment; the losses created by the sales were to be amortized {{over the life of}} the loan, and any losses could also be offset against taxes paid over the preceding ten years. This all made S eager to sell their loans. The buyers – major Wall Street firms – were quick to take advantage of the S' lack of expertise, buying at 60% to 90% of value and then transforming the loans by bundling them as, effectively, government-backed bonds by virtue of Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Fannie Mae guarantees. S were one group buying these bonds, holding $150 billion by 1986, and being charged substantial fees for the transactions.|$|E
