The decay slope of MAC without CSIT is M+ 1, while the the decay slope of the side channel is 1 /W. When the symmetric multiplexing gain r≤ 1 / 2, if W≥ 1 /M+ 1, the users in MAC will first be in error followed by the users’ <b>error</b> <b>event</b> in the side channel.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} and {{evaluate}} {{the performance of a}} new adaptive HARQ technique that utilizes the correlation among bit errors at the output of a convolutional decoder. The proposed correlated bit-error hybrid ARQ (CB-HARQ) uses <b>error</b> <b>events</b> encountered in a soft-input softoutput (SISO) decoder to capture the correlation in bit errors. Retransmission is requested for selected coded symbols that have the potential to correct a set of message bits associated with these <b>error</b> <b>events.</b> The performance of the proposed technique is compared to conventional incremental redundancy HARQ that uses rate-compatible punctured convolutional (RCPC) codes and reliability-based HARQ (RB-HARQ) that does not utilize correlation between <b>error</b> <b>events.</b> The fundamental difference between CB-HARQ and RB-HARQ is that CB-HARQ tries to correct <b>error</b> <b>events</b> occurring in a decoder whereas RB-HARQ tries to correct individual bit errors. The results show that the proposed HARQ technique based on correlated bit errors can provide much higher throughput. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{method to}} estimate code {{performance in the}} higher SNR region {{is to use a}} sum of the contributions of the most dominant <b>error</b> <b>events</b> to the probability of error. If an ML decoder is used, these events will be minimum distance codewords; the traditional decoder used in LDPC codes, some variant of the message passing algorithm, will intro-duce non-codeword <b>error</b> <b>events</b> known as trapping sets. For long LDPC codes it is difficult to enumerate all of these dominant <b>error</b> <b>events.</b> A procedure to efficiently find domi-nant <b>error</b> <b>events</b> by using the regular low-density structure of an LDPC code is presented here. The search method can be adapted to work with LDPC codes of various regular and irregular degree distributions, but is especially suited to a very practical subset of LDPC known as regular { 3, 6 } codes of moderate block length.

Moreover, this zero-redundancy dominant <b>error</b> <b>events</b> detection can be further extended to handle the deliberate bit errors when deliberate bit-flipping is used to enforce k-constraints.
