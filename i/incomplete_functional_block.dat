In this architecture, a component used as a building block is called a <b>functional</b> <b>block.</b> Each <b>functional</b> <b>block</b> has a standard structure, and the interface between <b>functional</b> <b>blocks</b> are defined {{with a set of}} standard protocols. This paper shows the structure of the database used by <b>functional</b> <b>blocks,</b> the structure of interfaces between <b>functional</b> <b>blocks,</b> and the structure of system management.

40|$|Intracavernous {{injection}} of various vasoactive drugs {{was performed in}} six erectile failure patients. The effects of each drug were evaluated in four grades: complete <b>functional</b> erection, <b>incomplete</b> <b>functional</b> erection, nonfunctional expansion and no effect. When papaverine hydrochloride (40 mg/ml) was administered, 4 of the 6 patients had nonfunctional expansion. By administering a mixture of 80 mg/ml papaverine hydrochloride with 1. 0 mg/ml phentolamine mesylate, nonfunctional expansion was seen in four patients and <b>incomplete</b> <b>functional</b> erection in two patients. As {{for the effects of}} prostaglandin E 1, <b>incomplete</b> <b>functional</b> erections were seen in all patients, while complete functional erection was seen in two patients. These findings indicated that the patients reacted differently to the same vasoactive drug, and that the papaverine and phentolamine mixture had a stronger effect than papaverine alone, while prostaglandin E 1 had the strongest effect on erection.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the presence and}} size of basic functional modules (motifs) in complex systems. The current view of motifs {{is that they are}} small modules of 3 - 4 “nodes”, which occur significantly more frequently in real-world networks than expected by chance alone. We show that standard <b>functional</b> <b>blocks</b> used to build real-world circuits where a node is interpreted as a primitive component, such as a primitive logic gate (AND, NAND, OR, NOR and NOT etc.), are much larger than the proposed 3 - 4 node motifs. In fact, these <b>functional</b> <b>blocks</b> themselves are typically comprised of a collections of several 3 - 4 node motifs. Further, we show that random-graph models currently cannot generate sub-graphs with the topology of <b>functional</b> <b>blocks,</b> implying that these <b>functional</b> <b>blocks</b> cannot be defined using the notions of statistical over-representation used for motifs. We argue that, for this domain, the statistical over-representation of 3 - 4 node motifs is due to <b>functional</b> <b>blocks</b> consisting of motif-clusters, and not that motifs, in and of themselves, play a significant functional role in a circuit. ...|$|R

30|$|Although our {{methodology}} for modeling the TI C 6416 T VLIW processor power consumption is applicable for other VLIW processors, for different targeted processor architecture we can reconsider {{the distinction of}} the processor architecture into <b>functional</b> <b>blocks</b> as shown in Figure 4. For example, if the new target architecture includes a floating-point unit, Figure 4 has to be modified by including a new <b>functional</b> <b>block</b> that represents the floating-point unit together with the parameters affecting its power consumption such as the access rate. Thus, {{as long as the}} power consumption of the <b>functional</b> <b>blocks</b> remains independent, our presented power estimation methodology is intended to work equally on all VLIW architectures.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{approach}} is proposed tocompute testability of a combinational circuit in a hierarchical design environment. The testability of a circuit is rst computed at the functional level using the Walsh expression of the <b>functional</b> <b>block,</b> and its complexity is linear {{with respect to the}} number of <b>functional</b> <b>blocks.</b> The <b>functional</b> level testability measure is then used to compute the testability at the gate/switch level. Our extensive simulation results show that the testability measure of the proposed method re ects closely to the actual testability measure (both at the functional level and the gate level) when the granularity of a <b>functional</b> <b>block</b> is much higher than that of primitive gates. ...|$|R
