40|$|Previous {{research}} has indicated that virgin rats (Rattus norvegicus) behave maternally (sensitize) more rapidly if kept in close proximity with pups. Since both parturient rats and a large percentage of virgin rats avidly consume placenta, we tested whether placenta and amnionic fluid, applied to the skin of the stimulus pups, would draw the female adults into closer contact with the pups and therefore hasten the onset of maternal behaviour. The results indicated that the procedure indeed shortened the maternal sensitization latency. Furthermore, this effect was not due to the wetness of the pups, to the presence of placenta in the cage, or to the adults having previously ingested placenta. Other attractive <b>ingestibles</b> applied to the pups' skin produced intermediate, but not significant, shortening of the maternal sensitization latency...|$|R

The nicotine in tobacco can also be dangerous. Dogs can {{be exposed to the}} substance by scavenging garbage or ashtrays; eating cigars and cigarettes. Signs can be vomiting of large amounts (e.g., from eating cigar butts) or diarrhea. Some other signs are abdominal pain, loss of coordination, collapse, or death. Dogs are highly susceptible to theobromine poisoning, typically from ingestion of chocolate. Theobromine is toxic to dogs because, although the dog's metabolism is capable of breaking down the chemical, the process is so slow that even small amounts of chocolate can be fatal, especially dark chocolate.|$|R

5000|$|One {{example of}} an {{application}} of this type {{may be found in}} [...] "hydration bags", which use an <b>ingestible</b> draw solute and are intended for separation of water from dilute feeds. This allows, for example, the ingestion of water from surface waters (streams, ponds, puddles, etc.) that may be expected to contain pathogens or toxins that are readily rejected by the FO membrane. With sufficient contact time, such water will permeate the membrane bag into the draw solution, leaving the undesirable feed constituents behind. The diluted draw solution may then be ingested directly. Typically, the draw solutes are sugars such as glucose or fructose, which provide the additional benefit of nutrition to the user of the FO device. A point of additional interest with such bags is that they may be readily used to recycle urine, greatly extending the ability of a backpacker or soldier to survive in arid environments. This process may also, in principle, be employed with highly concentrated saline feedwater sources such as seawater, {{as one of the first}} intended uses of FO with <b>ingestible</b> solutes was for survival in life rafts at sea.|$|E
50|$|Until recently, direct {{measurement}} of core body temperature required surgical insertion of a probe, so {{a variety of}} indirect methods have commonly been used. The rectal or vaginal temperature is generally considered to give the most accurate assessment of core body temperature, particularly in hypothermia. In the early 2000s, <b>ingestible</b> thermistors in capsule form were produced, allowing the temperature inside the digestive tract to be transmitted to an external receiver; {{one study found that}} these were comparable in accuracy to rectal temperature measurement.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that {{the mere presence of}} crude borates in cellulose insulation provides pest control properties to the product. While boric acid itself does kill self-grooming insects if ingested, it must be presented to an insect in both sufficient concentration and in an <b>ingestible</b> form in order to achieve insect fatality. Proper testing of products containing borates must be performed in order to determine whether dosage and presentation are sufficient to kill insects. Once tested, registration with the EPA as a pesticide is required before a product may be touted as having pesticidal capabilities in the US.|$|E
50|$|Termites are a {{important}} part of the diets of some species of Autarchoglossa, since, as social insects, they can be found in large numbers in one spot. Ants may form a prominent part of the diet of some lizards, particularly among the lacertas. Horned lizards are also well known for specializing on ants. Due to their small size and <b>ingestible</b> chitin, ants must be consumed in large amounts, and ant-eating lizards have larger stomachs than even herbivorous ones. Species of skink and alligator lizards eat snails and their power jaws and molar-like teeth are adapted for breaking the shells.|$|E
50|$|Methodologies can be {{as simple}} as sending {{notifications}} designed to alter behavior to patients who are at risk of obesity or diabetes and as complex as administering an <b>ingestible</b> radio tag that communicates with an external sensor to monitor the efficacy of a given medication. Diabetes and obesity prevention and management is a major focus in the field of digital therapeutics. Connected devices like insulin pumps, blood glucose meters, and wearable gadgets can all send data to a unified system. The therapy also uses self-reported data like diet or other lifestyle factors. It is also often used to monitor the potential for heart and lung conditions and change behaviors like smoking, poor diet, or a lack of exercise.|$|E
5000|$|LSD is {{produced}} in crystalline form and then mixed with excipients or redissolved for production in <b>ingestible</b> forms. Liquid solution is either distributed in small vials or, more commonly, sprayed onto or soaked into a distribution medium. Historically, LSD solutions were first sold on sugar cubes, but practical considerations forced a change to tablet form. Appearing in 1968 as an orange tablet measuring about 6 mm across, [...] "Orange Sunshine" [...] acid was the first largely available form of LSD after its possession was made illegal. Tim Scully, a prominent chemist, made some of these tablets, but said that most [...] "Sunshine" [...] in the USA came by way of Ronald Stark, who imported approximately thirty-five million doses from Europe.|$|E
50|$|A major {{inconvenience}} for {{the future}} clinical development of betulinic acid and analogues resides in their poor solubility in aqueous media such as blood serum and polar solvents used for bioassays. To circumvent this problem of hydrosolubility and to enhance pharmacological properties, many derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for cytotoxic activity. One study showed C-20 modifications involve the loss of cytotoxicity. Another study demonstrated {{the importance of the}} presence of the -COOH group, since compounds substituted at this position, such as lupeol and methyl betulinate, were less active on human melanoma than betulinic acid. Moreover, some C-28 amino acids and C-3 phthalates derivatives exhibited higher cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines with improved selective toxicity and water solubility. Chatterjee et al. obtained the 28-O-β-D-glucopyranoside of betulinic acid by microbial transformation with Cunninghamella species, while Baglin et al. obtained it by organic synthesis. This glucoside did not exhibit any significant in vitro activity on human melanoma (MEL-2) and human colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT-29) cell lines, which confirms the importance of the carboxylic acid function to preserve the cytotoxicity. Recently, Gauthier et al. synthesized a series of 3-O-glycosides of betulinic acid which exhibited a strongly potent in vitro anticancer activity against human cancer cell lines.A source of soluble and <b>ingestible</b> betulinic acid (and its precursor, betulin) is the chaga (Inonotus obliquus), a slow-growing medicinal fungus found as a parasite on birch trees in the coldest regions of the Northern Hemisphere. This mushroom converts the betulin present in the bark of the birch into a soluble and <b>ingestible</b> form of betulinic acid. Using a proper extraction protocol (alcohol/ethanol extraction) will make the compounds available for oral consumption. The slow-growing nature of the fungus (7-10 years minimum) and because it cannot be cultivated without losing most of its properties make this an unreliable source, though.|$|E
5000|$|Osmosis {{may be used}} {{directly}} to achieve separation of water from a solution containing unwanted solutes. A [...] "draw" [...] solution of higher osmotic pressure than the feed solution is used to induce a net flow of water through a semi-permeable membrane, such that the feed solution becomes concentrated as the draw solution becomes dilute. The diluted draw solution may then be used directly (as with an <b>ingestible</b> solute like glucose), or sent to a secondary separation process {{for the removal of}} the draw solute. This secondary separation can be more efficient than a reverse osmosis process would be alone, depending on the draw solute used and the feedwater treated. Forward osmosis is an area of ongoing research, focusing on applications in desalination, water purification, water treatment, food processing, etc.|$|E
5000|$|Details of Glossotherium’s diet {{are unclear}} since no dung {{deposits}} {{are available for}} analysis. However, based on dental evidence, Glossotherium was likely more suited to grazing, though it was also probably less efficient at ingesting grasses since its dental apparatus was more suited to shearing, {{which would have been}} too ineffective at processing plant materials down to an <b>ingestible</b> size to obtain adequate nutritive value. More recent tree sloths have a very slow rate of passage of food through the gut and it is likely that Glossotherium did as well. With a likely low metabolic rate, a large body size, a consequently reduced energy requirement for its weight, and an extraordinarily large gut that likely had a foregut fermentation site, Glossotherium could probably survive better on foods of lower nutritional value than other sloths could. Though it is likely Glossotherium primarily ate grasses, it also probably ate a variety of foliage as well and would be better considered a “browser-grazer” than simply a grazer.|$|E

5000|$|The use of plants, {{minerals}} and metals in medical therapeutics also existed in India. In Ayurvedic medicine, substances used in these therapeutics were known as 'Rasa dravyas.' Ayurvedic medicine instills the belief that every material {{had the potential to}} be used as a substance. This drove the creation of new products and new uses for common substances in nature. The people of Ayurvedic medicine categorize the materials in nature into three categories: 'Janagama,' substances from animals such as milk, urine, blood, and meat, 'Audbhida' or substances from plants such as stems, roots or leaves, and 'Paarthiwa' or metal/mineral substances such as gold, silver, copper or sulfur. There was especially an emphasis on the element, Mercury, in this culture. The name of these specific practices in Ayurvedic medicine, were termed 'Rasashaastra', which means the [...] "Science of Mercury." [...] which has eventually become known as Iatrochemistry in current terminology. Much of the focus of 'Rasashaastra' was on the processing of these metals to become <b>ingestible</b> by the human body. The therapeutic effect of the materials such as metals and minerals that were known to be indigestible by the human body were combined with plants or animal materials to increase their delivery ability to human body.|$|E

Therefore, accurate measurement of Tc during exercise is of great importance, especially in athletes who have to perform in challenging ambient conditions.
