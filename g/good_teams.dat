500|$|Wenger {{replied to}} Mourinho's {{comments}} {{by arguing that}} although plenty of managers have won the Champions League, most would not be considered greats – [...] "What is important is that you look at their careers in 10, 15 or 20 years. What kind of quality have you brought through in your work and on how consistent a level have you done it?" [...] He went on to suggest a manager's importance is [...] "...over the longer distance. The continuity in his career. Can he get <b>good</b> <b>teams</b> together and play in a certain style?" ...|$|E
500|$|Both teams {{valued the}} competition, despite some {{commentators}} being dismissive of the match's importance. CSKA captain Sergei Ignashevich underlined his team's determined mood: [...] "We know their players {{are very strong}} because they won the Champions League. But we are not thinking about individuals. We will only worry about ourselves and not them." [...] Likewise Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was equally determined to be successful: [...] "This {{is the opportunity to}} win another trophy. When you play against <b>good</b> <b>teams</b> you have to do your best. I am not thinking about the past and that we won the Champions League." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1990, their league was {{declared}} Senior A. [...] The Huskies put together consistently <b>good</b> <b>teams,</b> but kept failing {{to win their}} league championship {{in the face of}} the Creemore Chiefs and Elora Rocks. [...] In the summer of 1992, the Huskies declared themselves folded due to lack of interest.|$|E
2500|$|The Tigers {{continued}} to field <b>good</b> <b>teams</b> during Ty Cobb's tenure as player-manager, finishing {{as high as}} second in 1923, but lack of quality pitching kept them from winning a pennant. Harry Heilmann hit [...]403 in 1923, becoming the last AL player to top [...]400 until Ted Williams hit [...]406 in 1941. In the 1925 season, the 38-year-old Cobb nearly won his 12th batting title (or 13th depending on the source). But he was again edged out by teammate Heilmann, who collected six hits in a season-ending doubleheader to finish at [...]393 to Cobb's [...]389.|$|E
2500|$|Lyman later recalled: [...] "From {{the first}} day, I just loved the game, {{and we had}} some pretty <b>good</b> <b>teams,</b> too." [...] The 1921 Nebraska team {{compiled}} a 7–1 record, lost a close game against Knute Rockne's Notre Dame team, outscored opponents by a combined total of 283 to 17, and won the Missouri Valley Conference championship. [...] The 1922 Nebraska yearbook noted the following about Lyman: [...] "Lyman was, without doubt, our fastest lineman. Roy is a big man, weighing 200 pounds, and could get down under punts almost {{as quickly as the}} ends. Roy proved to be a ground gainer on tackle-around plays before the season was over." ...|$|E

2500|$|Top-ranked LSU {{defeated}} sixth-ranked, rival Ole Miss, 14–0 {{in a game}} {{dominated by}} defense and penalties. 68,000 fans packed Tiger Stadium to watch the Tigers win their first game against the Rebels since 1950. Ole Miss was LSU's most bitter rival at the time, and fans who heard and read about the Chinese Bandits and Billy Cannon wanted to see them first-hand. [...] "It's not a rivalry because somebody says it is," [...] said Cannon, [...] "or because you've been playing against a team for a long time. It's a rivalry when two <b>good</b> <b>teams</b> meet and either one could walk out the winner. This was a rivalry." [...] Banners were strung around the LSU campus with the words [...] "Go to Hell, Ole Miss." [...] Later, a plane dropped leaflets on campus that read [...] "Go to Hell, LSU." [...] Some thought Dietzel was responsible, hoping to fire up his team for the game, but he denied responsibility.|$|E
2500|$|Ruth's power hitting ability {{demonstrated}} {{a new way}} to play the game, and one that was extremely popular with the crowds. Accordingly, the ballparks were expanded, sometimes by building outfield seating which shrunk the size of the outfield and made home run hitting more practical. In addition to Ruth, hitters such as Rogers Hornsby also took advantage, with Hornsby compiling extraordinary figures for both power and average in the early 1920s. By the late 1920s and 1930s all the <b>good</b> <b>teams</b> had their home run hitting [...] "sluggers": the Yankees' Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx in Philadelphia, Hank Greenberg in Detroit and Chicago's Hack Wilson were the most storied. While the American League championship, {{and to a lesser extent}} the World Series, would be dominated by the Yankees, there were many other excellent teams in the inter-war years. Also, the National League's St. Louis Cardinals would win three titles themselves in nine years, the last with a group of players known as the [...] "Gashouse Gang".|$|E
2500|$|In their 2012 season opener, the Patriots easily {{defeated}} Tennessee {{before losing}} {{at home to}} Arizona. [...] In Week 3, New England faced a very tough Baltimore Ravens team in Baltimore. The Patriots remained competitive through the first half, but the Ravens came back to win 30-28 on a last-second field goal. [...] The first three {{games of the season}} had been officiated by replacement referees, as the regular referees were locked out during a contract dispute with the owners. [...] The replacement referees were widely criticized, {{and at the end of}} the Ravens game, Bill Belichick made contact with a referee as he was leaving the field to argue a call; the league fined him for it. [...] The Patriots rebounded in Week 4, easily defeating the Buffalo Bills 52-28. After that, the Patriots went on the defeat the Denver Broncos 31-21, but lost to the Seattle Seahawks 24-23 the following week. [...] The Patriots then defeated the New York Jets in overtime, 29-26, which brought on a seven-game win streak. During this streak, they defeated very <b>good</b> <b>teams</b> like the Indianapolis Colts, 59-24, and the Houston Texans, 42-14. After losing to the San Francisco 49ers 41-34 in Week 15, they defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Miami Dolphins to end the season.|$|E

2500|$|This was an {{exciting}} week for the two South African contenders the Bulls and the Sharks, both with possibilities of a home semi final. The action-packed weekend started with an upset, the in-form Chiefs beating the Crusaders 30–24 at Jade Stadium. This result gave the Sharks {{the opportunity to take}} the top spot if they won in Cape Town. The Blues smashed the Western Force 33–6 to keep their title dreams alive. Later, the Brumbies kept their semi final hopes alive by defeating the tired and weary Highlanders 29–10. Waratahs defeated the Hurricanes away in Wellington 38–14. Cheetahs gave the Lions the South African wooden spoon by beating them 16–10. The first main game of the day was the Stormers vs the Sharks. The Sharks played an efficient and professional game whilst the Stormers played their usual erratic hot and cold game that had seen them beat some <b>good</b> <b>teams</b> during the season, but in the end the Sharks easily claimed a 36–10 victory to be the first South African side to finish {{at the top of the}} table at the end of the round-robin stage in the Super 14 competition's history. The last game of the weekend promised to be a huge one for the Bulls, who were chasing a semi final spot. They came up against a feeble Reds team, who after going ahead 3–0 in the beginning, had no idea of the onslaught they were going to receive. The Bulls, who needed a bonus-point win to reach the semifinals, easily achieved this goal a quarter of the way into the [...] "match". Early in the second half they reached the 45-point margin needed to push them up to third place. Then the impossible became possible. If the Bulls went 72 points clear of the Reds, they would leapfrog to second, giving them a home semifinal in the high-altitude cauldron of noise that is Loftus Versfeld. They seemed to reach this goal with little effort against a humiliated Reds side, setting a new Super Rugby record for winning margin of 89 points.|$|E
60|$|Brown rose {{early in}} the morning and walked out to look at the {{establishment}} of his new friend. All was rough and neglected in the neighbourhood of the house;--a paltry garden, no pains taken to make the vicinity dry or comfortable, and a total absence of all those little neatnesses which give the eye so much pleasure in looking at an English farm-house. There were, notwithstanding, evident signs that this arose only from want of taste or ignorance, not from poverty or the negligence which attends it. On the contrary, a noble cow-house, well filled with good milk-cows, a feeding-house, with ten bullocks of the most approved breed, a stable, with two <b>good</b> <b>teams</b> of horses, the appearance of domestics active, industrious, and apparently contented with their lot; in a word, an air of liberal though sluttish plenty indicated the wealthy fanner. The situation of the house above the river formed a gentle declivity, which relieved the inhabitants of the nuisances that might otherwise have stagnated around it. At a little distance was the whole band of children playing and building houses with peats around a huge doddered oak-tree, which was called Charlie's Bush, from some tradition respecting an old freebooter who had once inhabited the spot. Between the farm-house and the hill-pasture was a deep morass, termed in that country a slack; it had once been the defence of a fortalice, of which no vestiges now remained, but which was said to have been inhabited by the same doughty hero we have now alluded to. Brown endeavoured to make some acquaintance with the children, but 'the rogues fled from him like quicksilver,' though the two eldest stood peeping when they had got to some distance. The traveller then turned his course towards the hill, crossing the foresaid swamp by a range of stepping-stones, neither the broadest nor steadiest that could be imagined. He had not climbed far up the hill when he met a man descending.|$|E
