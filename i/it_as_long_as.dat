Colbert has never met Rowling and the book has not been approved by her or Warner Brothers (the owner of the film rights to the Harry Potter novels).

25|$|The Third Reich tacitly tolerated Huch's {{contempt}} for <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> {{she was not}} too vocal about her opinions. James contrasts this silence with Huch’s younger, rebel years, when she intellectually admired Benito Mussolini's and Mikhail Bakunin’s anarchist origins. He describes how Huch stole her sister's husband and otherwise treated men and suitors {{in a manner that}} was stunning given her place and time. James believes this rebel attitude never died, as evidenced by the fact that she wrote with delight about the first air raid she experienced, in June 1943. Although 79 at the time, she enjoyed the destroyed buildings and rubble.|$|E
25|$|Philip himself wrote {{from prison}} to forward the {{acceptance}} of the Augsburg Interim, especially as his liberty depended upon <b>it.</b> <b>As</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> the unrestricted preaching of the Gospel and the Protestant tenet of justification by faith were secured, other matters seemed to him of subordinate importance. He read Roman Catholic controversial literature, attended mass, and was much impressed by his study of the Fathers of the Church. The Hessian clergy, however, boldly opposed the introduction of the Interim and the government at Kassel refused to obey the landgrave's commands. Meanwhile, his imprisonment was made still more bitter by the information which he received concerning conditions in Hesse, and the rigor of his confinement was increased after he had made an unsuccessful attempt to escape. It was not until 1552 that the Peace of Passau gave him his long-desired freedom and that he was able, on September 12, 1552, to reenter his capital, Kassel.|$|E

25|$|The {{interest}} to use Torp as an air station dwindled during the 1950s. Norway {{did not need}} the station for regular stationing of aircraft, and the United States did not need <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> Norway did not allow permanent stationing of foreign troops. In October 1956, the military stated {{that they did not}} mind if Torp also inaugurated a civilian sector. The municipalities established committee, and on 2 October 1957 the Ministry of Transport and Communications granted permission to establish a municipal civilian sector at Torp. At the time, Jarlsberg was still being used for scheduled services to Vestfold, and the plans to open Torp as a civilian airport met political resistance from Tønsberg. The civilian sector would cost NOK900,000, including a terminal building, a control tower, small maintenance facilities and a tarmac. A limited company, Andelslaget Torp flyplass, was established on 24 October 1958. In addition to the municipalities of Stokke and Sandar, several local companies and private individuals bought shares. The company changed its name to AS Torp Flyplass in 1959.|$|E

While Mir Mustafa Khan is alive, your government will have to protect the Khan his rights, by treating him personally and with due care; but once he will die his heirs will lose its independence and autonomy, turning in speechless and unfortunate slaves, the fault of the mad and visionary would degenerate Mir Mustafa Khan, the same who pursue only their personal goals in order to meet their lust for power, being a heartless and hardened egoist, as they're not thinking about the sad and desolate future of their offspring, who will betray him to anathema, because they will invite you here and handing the fate of their homeland to unfaithful strangers — rapists turning his people into meaningless plebeians. The groans and screams of the dead people involved in this network of selfish schemer — Mir Mustafa Khan will form an eternal curse upon <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> the Talysh Mountains stand firm, the bitter mourning the unfortunate fate of the Talysh people.|$|E
500|$|Vonnegut disregarded more {{mainstream}} political ideologies {{in favor of}} socialism, which he thought could provide a valuable substitute for {{what he saw as}} social Darwinism and a spirit of [...] "survival of the fittest" [...] in American society, believing that [...] "socialism would be a good for the common man". Vonnegut would often return to a quote by socialist and five-time presidential candidate Eugene V. Debs: [...] "As long as there is a lower class, I am in <b>it.</b> <b>As</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> there is a criminal element, I'm of <b>it.</b> <b>As</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> there is a soul in prison, I am not free." [...] Vonnegut expressed disappointment that communism and socialism seemed to be unsavory topics to the average American, and believed that they may offer beneficial substitutes to contemporary social and economic systems.|$|E

500|$|Wark {{played as}} a central defender, midfielder and, occasionally, as a striker. Wark was an unusual player; {{he was able to}} play as a {{defensive}} midfielder yet break forward to score. According to former team-mate Terry Butcher, this was because his colleagues would drop back to cover for him: [...] "I played with John Wark, who was a sitting midfielder but was one of the top scorers in England and Europe.

500|$|Ross {{has been}} a streaky player {{throughout}} his career.

I've been notorious for that my whole career, where I'll hit five or six in a week, where it seems like I can't miss the pitch and I feel good in the batter's box." [...] The most famous of these came in 2010, when Ross's torrid hitting in the playoffs helped San Francisco win the 2010 World Series.|$|E
