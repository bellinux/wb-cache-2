40|$|Abstract Background The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to measure the relationship between morbidity, direct health care costs and the degree of clinical <b>effectiveness</b> (<b>resolution)</b> of health centres and health professionals by the retrospective application of Adjusted Clinical Groups in a Spanish population setting. The secondary objectives are to determine the factors determining inadequate correlations and the opinion of health professionals on these instruments. Methods/Design We will carry out a multi-centre, retrospective study using patient records from 15 primary health care centres and population data bases. The main measurements will be: general variables (age and sex, centre, service [family medicine, paediatrics], and medical unit), dependent variables (mean number of visits, episodes and direct costs), co-morbidity (Johns Hopkins University Adjusted Clinical Groups Case-Mix System) and effectiveness. The totality of centres/patients will be considered as the standard for comparison. The efficiency index for visits, tests (laboratory, radiology, others), referrals, pharmaceutical prescriptions and total will be calculated as the ratio: observed variables/variables expected by indirect standardization. The model of cost/patient/year will differentiate fixed/semi-fixed (visits) costs of the variables for each patient attended/year (N = 350, 000 inhabitants). The mean relative weights of the cost of care will be obtained. The effectiveness will be measured using a set of 50 indicators of process, efficiency and/or health results, and an adjusted synthetic index will be constructed (method: percentile 50). The correlation between the efficiency (relative-weights) and synthetic (by centre and physician) indices will be established using the coefficient of determination. The opinion/degree of acceptance of physicians (N = 1, 000) will be measured using a structured questionnaire including various dimensions. Statistical analysis: multiple regression analysis (procedure: enter), ANCOVA (method: Bonferroni's adjustment) and multilevel analysis will be carried out to correct models. The level of statistical significance will be p < 0. 05. </p...|$|E

Major developments in genetic theory {{as well as in}} the availability, cost <b>effectiveness</b> and <b>resolution</b> of genetic markers were instrumental for particularly rapid progress over the last 10 years. Genetic studies of elasmobranchs are of direct importance and have application to fisheries management and conservation issues such as the definition of management units and identification of species from fins. In the future, increased application of the most recent and emerging technologies will enable accelerated genetic data production and the development of new markers at reduced costs, paving the way for a paradigm shift from gene to genome-scale research, and more focus on adaptive rather than just neutral variation.

40|$|While sales {{managers}} {{spend much}} of their time resolving sales force-related problems, existing theory offers little insight into the social exchange processes which occur in problem resolution situations. Using a qualitative inquiry method rooted in grounded theory, we uncover three key social exchange contributions used by sales managers when dealing with problem situations in the sales force: sales manager responsiveness, caring, and aggressiveness. We then show that the extent to which managers use these exchange contributions in problem situations is a function of manager characteristics, problem-specific characteristics, and the situational context.

In the second stage a Gauss–Hermite quadrature procedure is proposed for the computation of the inverse Fourier transform to recover the numerical solutions of the original simplified P 1 problem. The method avoids the discretization of the time variable in the considered system and it accurately resolves all time scales in radiative transfer regimes.

40|$|Structural cables in {{cable-stayed}} {{systems are}} subject to potential damage, mainly due to fatigue phenomena and galvanic corrosion. The paper analyzes how the dynamical behavior of cables is affected by diffuse damage, and investigates whether the damage can be identified through information selected from the dynamical response. A continuous monodimensional model of a damaged cable is used for this purpose. Damage {{is described as a}} reduction of the cable cross section, and defined in terms of its intensity, extent and position. The major effects of these different damage parameters on the cable static response and spectral properties are evidenced and discussed to verify the observability of the damage. The frequencies of the dominant transversal motion of the cable are chosen as damage indicators, since they are sufficiently sensitive to the damage intensity and extent, while the damage position requires additional information. The damage identification problem is formulated by defining an objective error function between the measured and the model frequencies, to be minimized in the space of the damage parameters. Pseudo-experimental data are initially used to test the <b>effectiveness</b> and <b>resolution</b> of the procedure. The results confirm the uniqueness of the problem solution and its correctness. The robustness of the solution is discussed while considering the presence of random errors of increasing amplitude.

The CARE study evaluated clinical <b>effectiveness,</b> EIM <b>resolution,</b> and safety of adalimumab in a large pan-European cohort of patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: In all, 945 patients with a Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) >/= 7 enrolled in this multicenter, open-label phase IIIb trial. Patients received subcutaneous adalimumab, 160 / 80 mg at weeks 0 / 2, then 40 mg every other week. Dose adjustments were allowed for CD-related concomitant medications (from week 8) and adalimumab (from week 12). Clinical endpoints were analyzed through week 20 for all patients, and after stratification by prior infliximab exposure and by reason for discontinuing infliximab (primary nonresponse [PNR] or other). RESULTS: The remission rate (HBI < 5) at week 20 was 52 % (95 % confidence interval, 49 %- 55 %) overall, and was higher for infliximab-naive versus infliximab-exposed patients (62 % versus 42 %, P < 0. 001). Remission rates were similar for PNR (37 %) and other reasons (43 %; P = 0. 278). Of 497 patients with baseline EIMs, 51 % were free of EIM signs and symptoms at week 20. Serious infectious adverse events were reported in 5 % of patients. Opportunistic infections and malignancies were rare (</= 1 %). There was one case of demyelinating disease, but no occurrences of lupus, tuberculosis, or death. CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of patients, adalimumab treatment resulted in rates of clinical remission and EIM resolution exceeding 50 %, and substantial rates of effectiveness in patients who had PNR to infliximab.

This is the first study to assess the association of selected phenotypic traits to specific genomic regions in the narrow genetic pool of temperate japonica. A set of 391 rice accessions were GBS-genotyped yielding-after data editing- 57000 polymorphic and informative SNPS, among which 54 % were in genic regions. In total, 42 significant genotype-phenotype associations were detected: 21 for plant morphology traits, 11 for grain quality traits, 10 for root architecture traits. The FDR of detected associations ranged from 3 · 10 - 7 to 0. 92 (median: 0. 25). In most cases, the significant detected associations co-localised with QTLs and candidate genes controlling the phenotypic variation of single or multiple traits. The most significant associations were those for flag leaf width on chromosome 4 (FDR = 3 · 10 - 7) and for plant height on chromosome 6 (FDR = 0. 011). We demonstrate the <b>effectiveness</b> and <b>resolution</b> of the developed platform for high-throughput phenotyping, genotyping and GWAS in detecting major QTLs for relevant traits in rice.
