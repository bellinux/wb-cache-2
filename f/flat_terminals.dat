50|$|The largest neck collar {{from the}} hoard {{consists}} of four twisted cables of silver, each a different size, hammer-welded together into <b>flat</b> <b>terminals.</b> The outermost cable consists of six thick, plaited rods and the inner three 'hollow' ropes each consists only of three coiled strands of double-twisted rods. Whilst the individual components of the collar can be paralleled, this 'West Viking' variant is unique. International trade associated with this hoard is best demonstrated by the 'Permian' style ring fragment, a type imported from Russia during {{the early part of}} the Viking period. Two complete six-plait cable neck-rings are also present in the hoard, as is a triple-strand neck-ring cut into half and used as hacksilver.|$|E

5000|$|The {{characteristic}} landform of {{an almost}} <b>flat,</b> shallow, <b>terminal</b> lakebed in an arid and semi-arid zone is commonly called a playa. In dry times, playas consist of cracking clay flats {{that can be}} crusted and hardened to varying degrees depending on their substrate and position in the landscape, and sometimes might be covered in {{a thin layer of}} soluble salt deposits. [...] Some lakebeds are devoid of vegetation, but others support diverse communities of forbs and grasses as they dry out, which make them a valuable potential grazing resource. When they contain water, arid and semi-arid lakes can also support highly productive aquatic plant beds and algal turfs that are {{an important component of the}} food chain.|$|R
40|$|The {{sunflower}} (Helianthus annuus L.) is {{native to}} the western U. S., but principal commercial production of the seed for oil is in other countries, especially Russia. World production of oil averaged near 8, 026, 150 tons from 1992 to 1994, and sunflower oil production in the U. S. has increased since 1966. Sunflowers are grown from southern Canada south to Mexico and Argentina and is the state flower of Kansas. The plant is a large, rough annual, with a stiff stem up to 10 or 12 feet tall. Leaves are cordate to ovate, rough, up to 12 inches long. The angular seeds are up to 1 / 2 inch long and are densely packed in the <b>flat,</b> <b>terminal</b> heads, which {{may be more than}} a foot across. Seeds are exposed in the head during growth. Seeds normally contain about 25 percent of the semi-drying oil, but this has been increased through breeding to above 40 percent. Oil is usually expressed by an initial cold press, followed by hot-pressing. The cold press oil is used as a salad and cooking oil and for margarine, the hot-press mainly in industry for paints, plastics, soaps, detergents and as a pesticide adjuvant. Oilseed sunflower seeds are usually smaller and are black in color. Oilseed hybrids generally have a thin The Crop Profile/PMSP database, including this document, is supported by USDA NIFA. hull that adheres to the kernel. Oilseed varieties can contain from 38 to 50 percent oil and about 20 percent protein. This seed produces a major source of the vegetable oil for the US and the world...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the years}} 1947 to 1949 the {{architect}} Alexey Shchusev developed a plan {{with the aid}} of a team of architects for the gradual reconstruction of the city. If in 1944 Chişinău only had 25,000 inhabitants, by 1950 it had had 50,000. There were constructed large-scale housing and palaces in the style of Stalinist architecture. This process continued under Nikita Khrushchev, who called for construction under the slogan [...] "good, cheaper and built faster". In 1971 the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union adopted a decision [...] "On the measures for further development of the city of Kishinev", which secured more than one billion rubles in investment from the state budget,. The new architectural style brought about dramatic change and generated the style that dominates today, with large blocks of <b>flats.</b> The <b>terminal</b> of the Chişinău International Airport was built in 1970 and reconstructed in 2000. A 17-story administrative building was erected in the 1980s in Central Chişinău.|$|R
50|$|Doellingeria infirma has {{a smooth}} slender 45 to 90 centimeters (18-36 inches) tall stem which is rough and {{sparingly}} branched at the summit. It has no basal leaves. The lower leaves {{are small and}} obovate. Higher on the stem the leaves become larger, 5 to 12 centimeters (2-5 inches) long and 2.5 to 4 centimeters (1-3 inches) wide. They are oblong-lanceolate, entire, smooth above and sparingly hispid on the veins beneath. There are usually between 3 and 33 flower heads, each consisting of 4-20 disc florets and 3-11 ray florets. The flower heads are arranged in a <b>terminal</b> <b>flat</b> topped cluster. The fruit are cypselae each with a pappus of tawny bristles.|$|R
40|$|Three novel, N-acyl-pro-pyrrolidine-type, inhibitors of prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) with nanomolar {{activities}} were synthesized and their binding analyzed {{to the host}} enzyme {{in the light of}} X-ray diffraction and molecular modeling studies. We were interested in the alteration in the binding affinity at the S 3 site {{as a function of the}} properties of the N-terminal group of the inhibitors. Our studies revealed that, for inhibitors with <b>flat</b> aromatic <b>terminal</b> groups, the optimal length of the linker chain is three C-C bonds, but this increases to four C-C bonds if there is a bulky group in the terminal position. Molecular dynamics calculations indicate that this is due to the better fit into the binding pocket. A 4 -fold enhancement of the inhibitor activity upon replacement of the 4 -CH 2 group of the proline ring by CF 2 is a consequence of a weak hydrogen bond formed between the fluorine atom and the hydroxy group of Tyr 473 of the host enzyme. There is notably good agreement between the calculated and experimental free energies of binding; the average error in the IC 50 values is around 1 order of magnitude...|$|R
40|$|Distinct ultrastructural {{differences}} exist at the neuromuscular junctions of red, white, and intermediate fibers of a mammalian twitch skeletal muscle (albino rat diaphragm). The primary criteria for recognizing the three fiber types {{are differences in}} fiber diameter, mitochondria) content, and width of the Z line. In the red fiber the neuromuscular relationship presents the least sarcoplasmic and axoplasmic surface at each contact. Points of contact are relatively discrete and separate, and axonal terminals are small and elliptical. The junctional folds are relatively shallow, sparse, and irregular in arrangement. Axoplasmic vesicles are moderate in number, and sarcoplasmic vesicles are sparse. In the white fiber long, <b>flat</b> axonal <b>terminals</b> present considerable axoplasmic surface. Vast sarcoplasmic surface area is created by long, branching, closely spaced junctional folds that may merge with folds at adjacent contacts to occupy a more continuous and widespread area. Axoplasmic and sarcoplasmic vesicles are numerous. Both axoplasmic and sarcoplasmic mitochondria of the white fiber usually contain intramitochondrial granules. The intermediate fiber has large axonal terminals {{that are associated with}} the most widely spaced and deepest junctional folds. In all three fiber types, the junctional sarcoplasm is rich in free ribosomes, cisternae of granular endoplasmic reticulum, and randomly distributed microtubules...|$|R
40|$|Fluorescence {{microscopy}} {{and transmission}} electron microscopy were used to study peribronchial ganglia of cats. An osmiophilic substance that is selectively taken up into the synaptic vesicles of adrenergic nerves (5 -hydroxydopamine) was used to help differentiate adrenergic and non-adrenergic terminals. Peribronchial ganglion cells show no catecholamine fluorescence and are unaffected by 5 -hydroxy-dopamine. There are three types of efferent terminals in the ganglia: cholinergic terminals, terminals with small agranular round and <b>flat</b> vesicles and <b>terminals</b> that contain large dense-core vesicles as well as small vesicles and tubules that take up 5 -hydroxydopamine. Clusters of SIF cells are associated with some peribronchial ganglia. It is suggested that peribronchial ganglion cells integrate synaptic input from two or three types of nerve terminals and may also be affected by catecholamines released into the bronchial vascular system by SIF cells...|$|R
40|$|A new tandem {{structure}} {{based on}} a silicon solar cell is presented. This structure works {{with two or three}} junction levels, being the silicon cell in this last case the intermediate cell. The different levels have been interconnected in parallel and for that a greater number of the lower band gap cells would be needed in order to equalize the operating voltage of all the structure. However, the presented three terminals structure only needs a maximum of 4 pn junctions for the 3 levels structure or even only 2 for a two level structure. This structure can be easily included in a conventional 2 <b>terminal</b> <b>flat</b> module without complicating the internal wiring. The maximum technological efficiency has been estimated in 39. 4 % for the three levels structure and using well known materials for each level a 30 to 32 % efficiency level sounds possible...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo {{fabricate}} a new surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) -active {{optical fiber}} sensor, {{the design and}} preparation of SERS-active sensing layer is one of important topics. In this study, we fabricated a highly sensitive three-dimensional (3 D) SERS-active sensing layer on the optical fiber terminal via in situ polymerizing a porous polymer material on a <b>flat</b> optical fiber <b>terminal</b> through thermal-induced process, following with the photochemical silver nanoparticles growth. The polymerized polymer formed a 3 D porous structure with the pore size of 0. 29 – 0. 81 μm, which were afterward decorated with abundant silver nanoparticles {{with the size of}} about 100 nm, allowing for higher SERS enhancement. This SERS-active optical fiber sensor was applied for the determination of 4 -mercaptopyridine, crystal violet and maleic acid The enhancement factor of this SERS sensing layer can be reached as about 108. The optical fiber sensor with high sensitive SERS-active porous polymer is expected for online analysis and environment detection...|$|R

Thus, the Philippine Institute for Development Studies and the National Economic and Development Authority commissioned NEXUS Agribusiness Solutions {{to undertake the}} "Rapid Appraisal of Selected Postharvest Facilities in the Philippines". The postharvest facilities (PHF) selection process considered at least one each for Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, and for the following PHF categories: 1. equipment and facilities required immediately after harvest; 2. processing and storage facilities; and 3. market infrastructure and transport facilities. Selected were four rice processing centers, established through a Korean International Cooperation Agency grant, in Pangasinan, Davao del Sur, Bohol, and Iloilo. Using these sites as hub, other nearby PHF such as food <b>terminals,</b> <b>flatbed</b> dryers, and threshers were included for evaluation. In the context of upgrading value chains, reducing postharvest losses and improving economic outcomes for smallholder farmers, selected PHF were characterized and assessed.
