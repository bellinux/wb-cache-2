40|$|The {{influence}} of Agrisorb (water solution 1, 3, 5 g/l) on lettuce and onion seed germination was tested in different moisture conditions (30 [*]ml and 15 [*]ml {{of water in}} <b>germination</b> <b>box).</b> Variants with reduced water level germinated much more slowly (MGT parameter) than standard variants, though differences in total germination {{at the end of}} the test were insignificant. Treated variants of lettuce seeds showed a statistically significant increase in germination energy (GE) on the first day (GE 1, both water levels), but a significant decrease on the second day (columns GE 2, 15 ml). Higher doses of Agrisorb slowed lettuce seed germination (GE 2, 30 [*]ml, dose 5 [*]g) significantly, similarly see GE 2 (15 [*]ml, doses 1, 3, 5 g). This slowdown was apparent for GE 3 (both water amount) as well. A similar but insignificant effect was evident for onions. There was an {{influence of}} cultivar and seed vigour on sensitivity to water stress. The hydrogel application influenced germination of lettuce and onion seeds. Treated lettuce seeds germinated faster than non-treated control in the beginning of germination process. This effect was not recorded in case of slowly germinated onion seed lots. Although influence of Agrisorb was positive in the beginning, higher doses of hydrogel reduced germination energy of treated seed lots (for example GE 2, GE 4) of both crops in comparison with non-treated control. Higher doses of hydrogel caused longer MGT of lettuce and onion as well...|$|E
40|$|Standard {{method in}} {{physical}} and physiological quality testing is very imprortant {{to support a}} controlling system of distributed seed quality by certification that will provide a guarantee to prosedure; distributor, and user. Five seed lot of sawo kecil (Manilkara kauki) from Mokmer (Bali), Benoa (Bali), Lombar (Lombok), Kaliurang (Yogyakarta) and Alas Purwo (Banyuwangi) were used to identify the best method for moisture content and germination testing. Completely randomized design was applied {{to determine the best}} method for moisture content testing. The treatments in selection of the appropriateMethod were oven method on the temperature 130 – 133 oC (1 -, 2 -, 3 -, and 4 hours) and temperature 103 ± 20 C (16 -, 18 -, 20 -, 22 -, and haours). The selection of germination method used completely randomized design with 3 factors of treatment, i. e. sowing media, pretreatment, and germination condition. The result showed that oven method at temperature 103 +_ 20 C for 24 hours and at temperature 130 - 1330 C 4 hours provided the best result for seed moisture content testing. For seed germination testing, seeds sowed on the sand media with drying-wetting pretreatmen for 3 days on the <b>germination</b> <b>box</b> covered by transparent plastic provided the best germination capacity and speed toward 5 seed lots. The methods can be considered to be appied in the testing of moisture conten and germination of sawo kecik seeds...|$|E
30|$|After each exhume, {{the seeds}} were sorted {{from the soil}} with 2  mm sieve and graded based on their {{physical}} appearance and strength. During the first exhume in both experiments, the seeds that germinated in the field were found with their intact dead plumule and radicle tissues. Moreover, some seeds died in the field as evidenced by their brown endosperm and the easiness with which they crushed when minimum force was applied to them. However, starting from the second exhume {{it was difficult to}} identify those seeds, which germinated in the field as the dried tissues decomposed. The stiff seeds were washed and kept in <b>germination</b> <b>boxes</b> and soaked in 2 % Clorox for 5  minutes in order to sterilize them and rinsed twice with distilled water. The seeds were then placed in new 11  cm[*]×[*] 11  cm[*]×[*] 3.5  cm <b>germination</b> <b>boxes</b> on blotters wetted with distilled water. The <b>germination</b> <b>boxes</b> were placed in incubator adjusted at 30 °C temperature, which was selected based on calibration. The germinated seeds were counted and removed starting from the third day for two weeks. Later, the non germinated seeds were tested for viability by dissecting and soaking them in 1 % Tetrazolium chloride (2, 3, 5 -triphenyltetrazolium chloride) solution for 6 – 8  hours at 35 °C in an incubator. Seeds that were fully or > 2 / 3 stained (red) were considered viable. Therefore, the whole data in each set was classified in to three groups: germinated in lab (germinable), dormant and dead. The dormant seeds group included those seeds which didn’t germinate during lab germination test, but were found viable using TTC test. The dead group included seeds those germinated and/or decayed in the field and those found intact but confirmed dead after TTC test. All of the proportions (percentage) of the viability measures were estimated based on the original 50 seeds. Data on mean monthly soil temperature at 10  cm and 20  cm depth and rainfall measurements were recorded at a meteorological weather station of the research center located about 200 meters from the experimental plot.|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} {{was carried out}} {{to determine the effects}} of seed size on germination and early growth rate of Gmelina arborea. Mature seeds of Gmelina arborea were collected from the mother trees in Uyo Local Government Area, Akwa Ibom State. They were grouped into 3 categories as large seed size (LSS), medium seed size (MSS) and small seed size (SSS), using a predetermined weight method. A total of six hundred depulped seeds from each size class were selected and weighed and had the following Copyright © IAARR 2011 : www. afrrevjo. com 423 Indexed African Journals Online: www. ajol. info values: 0. 94 g, 0. 57 g and 0. 38 g respectively. The seeds were sown in <b>germination</b> <b>boxes</b> measuring (28 cm x 14 cm x 14 cm) and germination was observed for two weeks. Germination percentages were calculated by dividing the number of germinated seeds against the number of seeds sown. At two-leaf stage, seedlings were transplanted into polythene pots and lai...|$|R
40|$|While {{studying}} {{the influence of}} human proximity on the ecology of pigtail macaques, a species not well documented in continental Thailand, we collected data on ranging and foraging behaviours of a troop of Macaca nemestrina leonina living in the surroundings of Khao Yai National park tourist centre. We present here data suggesting a role as seed dispersers for the pigtails, role {{which has not been}} considered yet when analysing the importance of the frugivorous community in forest regeneration. Such a role might be however expected based on the highly frugivorous diet of the macaques, the presence of cheek pouches, and the relatively long distance they travel daily. The studied troop counts about 40 individuals, with 3 adult males for 9 adult females, and occupies a 100 ha home range with sleeping sites close to the tourist facilities. Macaques spent about 30 % of their days in primary forests, and more than 60 percent in secondary forest and open areas. They consume a certain proportion of human food (6. 4 %), but spend most time foraging for wild food in the surrounding forest. Fruits count for an important part of their diet (76 %) and, indeed, the faeces analysis reveals the presence of a high number of seeds, which size ranges up to above 15 mm. Their viability was assessed using the cut-test and Tetrazolium immersion, showing a high percentage of viable seeds in the samples. Three series of seeds (defecated, spat, and control seeds) placed in <b>germination</b> <b>boxes</b> reached a high germination rate, with no uniform significant differences between defecated, spat and control seeds. Seeds without pulp, a frequent case when macaques reject them after transport and processing, seem to be more likely to germinate than seeds rejected with their pulp directly under the parent tree. These results suggest altogether that pigtail macaques are potential seed dispersers, an important factor in regard of their regular use of degraded habitat zones. Peer reviewe...|$|R
