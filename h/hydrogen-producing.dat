50|$|Most {{models have}} {{explained}} {{the origin of}} the endosymbiosis in terms of the advantage gained by the host cell due to the greater energy production available through aerobic respiration (32 net ATP vs. 2 net for glycolysis). However, this hypothesis has several limitations. No known organism exports ATP to its environment, making it unlikely that a bacterium would begin doing so to its host. In addition, some eukaryotes possess mitochondria-derived organelles called hydrogenosomes which perform a type of anaerobic respiration, suggesting an adaptation to an anoxic environment. An alternative explanation known as the Hydrogen Hypothesis suggests that the unique conditions of the Canfield Ocean may have exerted a positive selective pressure on mitochondria for reasons unrelated to aerobic respiration. According to the Hydrogen Hypothesis, the original endosymbiotic event was between a <b>hydrogen-producing</b> bacterium and a hydrogen-consuming archaeon. This symbiosis would have been advantageous in the anoxic conditions in the deeper reaches of the oceans at that time and would explain the widespread phylogenetic distribution of anaerobic respiration genes among eukaryotes. One other hypothesis is that a sulfur-metabolizing archaea and the ancestor of mitochondria lived in proximity, each feeding on the other's waste products and deriving energy through the recycling of sulfur. When environmental conditions became harsh for one partner, the energy generation and recycling system became internalized and the archaeon and ancestral mitochondria fused to form one organism.|$|E

In this study, we investigated the diversity and distribution of potentially <b>hydrogen-producing</b> bacteria in Prony hyperalkaline springs by using metagenomic analyses and different PCR-amplified DNA sequencing methods. The retrieved sequences of hydA genes, encoding the catalytic subunit of [FeFe]-hydrogenases and, used as a molecular marker of <b>hydrogen-producing</b> bacteria, were mainly related to those of Firmicutes and clustered into two distinct groups depending on sampling locations.

The former primers revealed the composition of all coexisting microorganisms, whereas the latter ones provided information on which clostridia were responsible for the biohydrogen production in various operational conditions. When sucrose was selected as the feeding substrate, the biogas production and hydrogen production rate (HPR) of the system increased as the percentage of Clostridium spp. (especially C. pasteurianum) increased. The cell count of C. pasteurianum increased up to 90 % of the total cell population when the system approached its maximum hydrogen production. C. butyricum was identified as the main <b>hydrogen-producing</b> clostridium in the condensed molasses soluble wastewater feeding system, but there was no significant correlation between system HPR and C. butyricum cell count. At the same time, other microorganisms, such as Bifidobacterium spp. and Klebsiella spp., were the predominant ones throughout the whole operation and possibly caused the unsatisfied biohydrogen production. The composition of microorganisms is the principal factor affecting biohydrogen production.

The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a biohydrogen production technology from food wastewater focusing on hydrogen production efficiency and micro-flora community at different hydraulic retention times. Soluble condensed molasses fermentation (CMS) was used as the substrate because it is sacchariferous and ideal for hydrogen production. CMS contains nutrient components that are necessary for bacterial growth: microbial protein, amino acids, organic acids, vitamins and coenzymes. The seed sludge was obtained from the waste activated sludge from a municipal sewage treatment plant in Central Taiwan. This seed sludge was rich in Clostridium sp. A CSTR (continuously stirred tank reactor) lab-scale hydrogen fermentor (working volume, 4. 0 L) was operated at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 3 - 24 h with an influent CMS concentration of 40 g COD/L. The results showed that the peak hydrogen production rate of 390 mmol H(2) /L-d occurred at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 320 g COD/L-d at a HRT of 3 h. The peak hydrogen yield was obtained at an OLR of 80 g COD/L-d at a HRT of 12 h. At HRT 8 h, all hydrogenase mRNA detected were from Clostridium acetobutylicum-like and Clostridium pasteurianum-like <b>hydrogen-producing</b> bacteria by RT-PCR analysis. RNA based hydrogenase gene and 16 S rRNA gene analysis suggests that Clostridium exists in the fermentative <b>hydrogen-producing</b> system and might be the dominant <b>hydrogen-producing</b> bacteria at tested HRTs (except 3 h). The hydrogen production feedstock from CMS is lower than that of sucrose and starch because CMS is a waste and has zero cost, requiring no added nutrients. Therefore, producing hydrogen from food wastewater is a more commercially feasible bioprocess. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu.

According to the PCR-DGGE analysis, bacterial community structures were mainly composed of Clostridium sp. (possibly Clostridium pasteurianum), Klebsiella oxytoca, and Streptococcus sp. Significant increase of Clostridium/ total cell ratio (68 %) was observed when the reactor was operated under higher influent flow rate. The existence of Streptococcus sp. in the reactor became more important when operated under a short HRT as indicated by the ratio of Streptococcus probe-positive cells to Clostridium probe-positive cells changing from 21 % (HRT 4 h) to 38 % (HRT 0. 5 h). FISH images suggested that Streptococcus cells probably acted as seeds for self- flocculated granule formation. Furthermore, combining the inspections with hydrogen production under different HRTs and their corresponding FISH analysis indicated that K oxytoca did not directly contribute to H- 2 production but possibly played a role in consuming O- 2 to create an anaerobic environment for the <b>hydrogen-producing</b> Clostridium...|$|E
40|$|This paper, for {{the first}} time, {{describes}} {{the development of a}} microbial biocathode for hydrogen production that is based on a naturally selected mixed culture of electrochemically active micro-organisms. This is achieved through a three-phase biocathode startup procedure that effectively turned an acetate- and hydrogen-oxidizing bioanode into a <b>hydrogen-producing</b> biocathode by reversing the polarity of the electrode. The microbial biocathode that was obtained in this way had a current density of about - 1. 2 A/Nm 2 at a potential of - 0. 7 V. This was 3. 6 times higher than that of a control electrode (- 0. 3 A/m 2). Furthermore, the microbial biocathode produced about 0. 63 m 3 H 2 /m 3 cathode liquid volume/day at a cathodic hydrogen efficiency of 49 % during hydrogen yield tests, whereas the control electrode produced 0. 08 m 3 H 2 /m 3 cathode liquid volume/day at a cathodic hydrogen efficiency of 25 %. The effluent of the biocathode chamber could be used to inoculate another electrochemical cell that subsequently also developed an identical <b>hydrogen-producing</b> biocathode (- 1. 1 A/m 2 at a potential of - 0. 7 V). Scanning electron micrographs of both microbial biocathodes showed a well-developed biofilm on the electrode surface...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of syntrophic relationships among microorganisms participating in biogas formation has been emphasized, and the regulatory role of in situ hydrogen production has been recognized. It {{was assumed that}} the availability of hydrogen may be a limiting factor for hydrogenotrophic methanogens. This hypothesis was tested under laboratory and field conditions by adding a mesophilic (Enterobacter cloacae) or thermophilic <b>hydrogen-producing</b> (Caldicellulosyruptor saccharolyticus) strain to natural bio-gas-producing consortia. The substrates were waste water sludge, dried plant biomass from Jerusalem artichoke, and pig manure. In all cases, a significant intensification of biogas production was observed. The composition of the generated biogas did not noticeably change. In {{addition to being a}} good hydrogen producer, C. saccharolyticus has cellulolytic activity; hence, it is particularly suitable when cellulose-containing biomass is fermented. The process was tested in a 5 -m(3) thermophilic biogas digester using pig manure slurry as a substrate. Biogas formation increased at least 160 - 170 % upon addition of the <b>hydrogen-producing</b> bacteria as compared to the biogas production of the spontaneously formed microbial consortium. Using the hydrogenase-minus control strain provided evidence that the observed enhancement was due to interspecies hydrogen transfer. The on-going presence of C. saccharolyticus was demonstrated after several months of semicontinuous operation...|$|E
