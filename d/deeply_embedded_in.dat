5|$|Raising the Mary Rose meant {{overcoming}} {{a number}} of delicate problems {{that had never been}} encountered before. The raising of the Swedish warship Vasa 1959–61 was the only comparable precedent, but it had been a relatively straightforward operation since the hull was completely intact and rested upright on the seabed. It had been raised with basically the same methods as were in use in Tudor England: cables were slung under the hull and attached to two pontoons {{on either side of the}} ship which was then gradually raised and towed into shallower waters. Only one third of the Mary Rose was intact and she lay <b>deeply</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> mud. If the hull were raised in the traditional way, there was no guarantee that it would have enough structural strength to hold together out of water. Many suggestions for raising the ship were discarded, including the construction of a cofferdam around the wreck site, filling the ship with small buoyant objects (such as ping pong balls) or even pumping brine into the seabed and freezing it so that it would float and take the hull with it. After lengthy discussions it was decided in February 1980 that the hull would first be emptied of all its contents and strengthened with steel braces and frames. It would then be lifted to the surface with floating sheerlegs attached to nylon strops passing under the hull and transferred to a cradle. It was also decided that the ship would be recovered before the end of the diving season in 1982. If the wreck stayed uncovered any longer it risked irreversible damage from biological decay and tidal scouring.|$|E

The sensor design includes four components: mass block housing, middle cylinder, connector housing, optical fibers and mass-block. The block housing is to hold the mass block and guide its sliding. Two blocks are designed to stretch sensing optical fiber when the block housing has inclination. The sensing optical fiber are required for performing sensing task in a ela range. One end of the whole pipe sensor is fixed to a pole, which was <b>deeply</b> <b>embeded</b> <b>in</b> soil of embankment dam.

The more southern {{of these two}} populations feeds on the seeds of a native host vine balloon vine (Cardiospermum corindum). This vine produces capsules of a fairly uniform size, which adult J. haematoloma feed on by inserting their mouthparts (beak) through the capsule's exterior and into the interior seeds. In the mid-1950s, a related southeast Asian tree, the Taiwanese Flamegold (Koelreuteria elegans), was introduced as an ornamental plant. It escaped domestication and naturalized.

25|$|Patriarchal {{values are}} <b>deeply</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> {{the society of}} Pakistan, and its {{different}} manifestations are observed in {{different aspects of the}} society. As mentioned above, gender division of labour enforces women to primarily specialize in unpaid care work as mothers and wives at home, whereas men perform paid work, and come out as breadwinners. This has led to a low level of resource investment in girls' education not only by their families but also by the state. This low investment in women's human capital, compounded by negative social biases and cultural practices, restrictions on women's mobility and the internalization of patriarchy by women themselves, becomes the basis for gender discrimination and disparities in most spheres of life. Some of the ramifications are that women are unable to develop job-market skills, hence, they have limited opportunities available to them in the wage-labour market. Moreover, social and cultural restrictions limit women's chances to compete for resources in a world outside the four walls of their homes. It translates into social and economic dependency of women on men. The nature and degree of women's oppression and subordination vary across classes, regions and the rural and urban divide in Pakistan. It has been observed that male dominant structures are relatively more marked in the rural and tribal setting where local customs and indigenous laws establish stronger male authority and power over women.|$|E
25|$|Islam is monotheistic {{and insists}} {{that there can}} be no intercessors between an {{individual}} and God. Nevertheless, Sudanese Islam includes a belief in spirits as sources of illness or other afflictions and in magical ways of dealing with them. The imam of a mosque is a prayer leader and preacher of sermons. He may also be a teacher and in smaller communities combines both functions. In the latter role, he is called a faqih (pl., fuqaha), although a faqih need not be an imam. In addition to teaching in the local Qur'anic school (khalwa), the faqih is expected to write texts (from the Qur'an) or magical verses to be used as amulets and cures. His blessing may be asked at births, marriages, deaths, and other important occasions, and he may participate in wholly non-Islamic harvest rites in some remote places. All of these functions and capacities make the faqih the most important figure in popular Islam. But he is not a priest. His religious authority is based on his putative knowledge of the Qur'an, the sharia, and techniques for dealing with occult threats to health and well- being. The notion that the words of the Qur'an will protect against the actions of evil spirits or the evil eye is <b>deeply</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> popular Islam, and the amulets prepared by the faqih are intended to protect their wearers against these dangers.|$|E

40|$|The ongoing {{economic}} crisis world around {{has asked for}} a theoretical understanding and deep analysis of what have been wrong in our economic system in specific and social system as whole. Discussions in many forums and mass media have mostly focused on a level of first order casual-effects such as bank and credit system in relation to house loans and car industries, and where and how much the stimulating packages should be distributed, etc. This is what I called a liveability level problem. A second order understanding of fundamental systems structure and social subsystems relationships however, have not been much addressed properly. This is what I called the sustainability problem. This paper will propose an epistemological model based on cybernetic feedback principle and the Activity Theory to interpret the second order problems that <b>deeply</b> <b>embed</b> <b>in</b> our social-economic system structure. So the liveability and sustainability are coherently discussed within a socio-cybernetic system. The {{first part of the}} paper introduces shortly principles of feedbacks from cybernetics, especially understanding the behaviours of positive and negative feedbacks. Then, the Activity Theory and related concepts from social autopoietic theory are introduced. The aim of introducing those concepts is to provide the basic elements/components to the construction of a double-loops feedback model in the second part.

40|$|The Internet’s {{tremendous}} {{success as}} well as our maturing realization of its architectural shortcomings have attracted significant research attention towards clean-slate re-designs in recent times. A number of these shortcomings {{can be traced back to}} naming. The current Internet uses IP addresses to conflate identity and network location, which results in poor support for mobility and multihoming; vulnerability to hijacking and spoofing of addresses, etc. The Internet’s name resolution infrastructure <b>deeply</b> <b>embeds</b> <b>in</b> its design the assumption of mostly stationary hosts and poorly satisfies the performance, security, and functionality demanded by modern mobile services. As a step towards addressing these shortcomings, we present the design of a global name service that forms a central component of the MobilityFirst, a clean-slate Internet architecture with mobility and trustworthiness as principal design goals. MobilityFirst relies on the global name service to cleanly separate identity from network location and to resolve identifiers to locations in a secure manner. More importantly, MobilityFirst capitalizes on the role of the name resolution infrastructure as a logically central, first point of contact to significantly enhance a number of network-layer functions such as supporting host and network mobility, multi-homed traffic engineering, content retrieval, multicast, and next-generation context-aware services. This paper identifies key challenges that must be addressed to realize such a vision and outlines the design of a distributed global name service that can resolve identifiers to dynamic attributes in a fast, consistent, and costeffective manner at Internet scales.
