40|$|We are {{interested}} in the links between numbers and their representations. In the <b>decimal</b> <b>numeration</b> <b>system,</b> a number is even if its representation ends with 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, which give rise to a simple representation set, that is, accepted by a finite automaton. More generally, in an integer base numeration system, any divisibility criterion is recognized by a finite automaton. The state complexity of a regular language is the number of states of the minimal automaton accepting this language. The syntactic complexity is the size of the associated syntactical monoid. The first one only takes into account the context on the right side, whereas the second considers both left and right contexts. Given a set of integers, we want to answer the following questions. What is the associated state complexity? What is the associated syntactic complexity? These questions extend to more general numeration systems, as linear numeration systems or abstract numeration systems. Such problems are motivated by decidability problems. For example : given an automaton recognizing a set of integers, decide if this set is ultimately periodic...|$|E
40|$|Forty-eight {{students}} across Grades 3 to 6 were interviewed individually using {{a range of}} tasks, where the mathematical focus was decimal knowledge and understanding. Students who may be categorised as “apparent experts ” on a decimal comparison test were found to differ considerably {{in their ability to}} perform ordering and benchmarking tasks. Those students whose explanations when comparing decimals reflected a greater place value knowledge and who were not following a rule which ultimately treats decimals as whole numbers, appeared to have a more conceptual understanding of the <b>decimal</b> <b>numeration</b> <b>system</b> and were able to apply this understanding to more difficult (or novel) tasks. A connected understanding of decimals has increased in importance since the introduction of the metric system of measurement and the wider use of calculators and computers. Results from major studies (e. g., Brown, 1981; Wearne & Kouba, 2000) indicated that decimals create great confusion for many students and many studies indicated that much of this difficulty arose because students were treating decimals as whole numbers. It has also been documented that students rely on procedures to the detriment of number sense or meaning when computing with decimals (Hiebert & Wearne, 1985). Over the last two decades there has been considerable documentation of erroneous rules or misconceptions that students appear to use when asked to compare or order decimal numbers.

The references that guide the investigation and the data analysis regularize themselves in the historic-cultural approach. To treat the foundations of historiccultural theory, we resort to the studies of Vygotsky (1988); Leontiev (1972); Rigon, Asbahr & Moretti (2010); Moura (2010) and other, Shulman (1986, 1987); Mizukami (2004) and other, about the professional knowledges; and Migueis & Azevedo (2007); Megid (2009); Nacarato et al (2011) and other, about the discussions of the mathematics in the early years. And, the historical aspects, theoretical-methodological and the school practices of SND we refer to Ifrah (2005); Boyer (1974); Lerner & Sadovsky (1996); Lanner de Moura (2007) and other. The research sets itself in a qualitative approach of case study, referred in Bogdan & Biklen (1994); Gonzáles Rey (2012); Stake (2010); André (1995) and other. Two teachers of the 2 nd year {{and one of the}} 1 st year of the Elementary School participated of the investigation. The sources of data are: characterization questionnaire, observation with record in a field diary, interviews and school documents. The data showed, in general, schooling experiences with little relevance in the access of construction/appropriation of mathematical knowledge and the process of professional formation, initial and continuing, as insufficient. That the absent of a proposal consolidated of collective pedagogical work and continuing formation in the school where they act, reflect in the actual practice and compromises the possibility of the teachers expanding their professional knowledge and promoting qualitative alterations in the process of teaching and learning of SND. We ascertain that, even though the pedagogical work of the teachers are different in some moments, their practices come close when teaching the SND without considering their genesis and history and the knowledge already elaborated by the students, they do not motivate the interaction between students and, also, the pedagogical mediation characterize itself by the collective orientation about the procedures to be adopted to the resolution of the proposed exercises. The teaching of SND is done, generally, through the emphasis of the names of the units of order, when the realization of numerical operations through conventional algorithms, without returning and promoting reflections with the students about the rules and properties of SND, underlying operations. We found that there are some blanks in the specific and curricular knowledge of the teachers, specially, about the comprehension of the base ten and positional value of algorithms and knowledge of the proposal approaches of SND presents in the official curricular references, which reverberates in how they develop the teaching of this content. The analysis of data also takes us to consider that the teaching of SND should consider the history and the creation of the concept from problem situations that allow to the teachers and students to live them as protagonists and not as mere transmitters and viewers. So the teacher needs to have objective work conditions and the initial and continuing formation need to be rethoughtEsta pesquisa procura responder à questão: “que conhecimentos profissionais sobre o Sistema de Numeração Decimal são manifestados por professores do 2 º e 3 º anos do Ensino Fundamental e como desenvolvem práticas escolares relacionadas a este conteúdo numa escola da rede municipal de Cuiabá?”. Os referenciais que norteiam a investigação e análise dos dados se pautam na abordagem histórico-cultural. Para tratar acerca dos fundamentos da teoria histórico-cultural, recorremos aos estudos de Vygotsky (1988); Leontiev (1972); Rigon, Asbahr e Moretti (2010); Moura (2010) e outros, de Shulman (1986, 1987); Mizukami (2004) e outros, sobre os conhecimentos profissionais; e, de Migueis e Azevedo (2007); Megid (2009); Nacarato et al.

Sobre os aspectos históricos, teórico-metodológicos e das práticas escolares do Sistema de Numeração Decimal (SND), referendamo-nos em Ifrah (2005); Boyer (1974); Lerner e Sadovsky (1996); Lanner de Moura (2007) e outros. A pesquisa se configura numa abordagem qualitativa do tipo estudo de caso, referendada em Bogdan e Biklen (1994); Gonzáles Rey (2012); Stake (2010) e André (1995). Participaram da investigação duas professoras do 2 º ano e uma do 3 º ano do 1 º ciclo do Ensino Fundamental. As fontes dos dados foram os questionários de caracterização, observações com registro em diário de campo, entrevistas e documentos escolares. Os dados apontam, de modo geral, experiências escolares pouco relevantes no sentido do acesso e da apropriação dos conhecimentos matemáticos e um processo de formação profissional, inicial e continuada, insuficientes. A ausência de uma proposta consolidada de trabalho pedagógico coletivo e de formação contínua na escola em que atuam, reflete na prática pedagógica e compromete a possibilidade de as professoras participantes da pesquisa ampliarem seus conhecimentos profissionais e de promoverem mudanças qualitativas no processo de ensino e aprendizagem do SND. Os dados indicam que apesar do trabalho pedagógico das professoras se diferenciar em alguns momentos, suas práticas se aproximam ao ensinar o SND sem considerar a sua gênese e historicidade e ao proporem exercícios que não promovem reflexões sobre suas regras e propriedades. Constatamos que as professoras apresentam fragilidades nos conhecimentos específico, pedagógico e curricular relacionados ao SND, principalmente quanto à compreensão da base dez e do valor posicional dos algarismos e conhecimento das propostas de abordagens do SND, presente nos referenciais curriculares oficiais, os quais repercutem na maneira como desenvolvem o ensino deste conteúdo. A análise dos dados também nos leva a conceber que o ensino do SND deva considerar a historicidade da criação deste conceito a partir de situações problemas que possibilitem aos professores e alunos vivenciá-lo como protagonistas. Para isto, o professor precisa ter condições objetivas de trabalho, estar inserido em um projeto coletivo de educação que possa oportunizar a socialização de ideias, práticas e novas aprendizagens.
