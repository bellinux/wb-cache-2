40|$|The {{assessment}} of inflationary pressures in Colombia has faced two important {{challenges in the}} present decade. The first one occurred in 2006 and consisted of detecting an overheating economy {{in the midst of}} fast growing investment and increasing measured productivity. The second challenge took place in 2007 - 2008, when the economy was hit by a number of "supply" shocks and core <b>inflation</b> <b>indicators</b> sent diverging signals about the transmission of those shocks to macroeconomic inflation. An evaluation of the first episode shows that traditional indicators of productivity and unit labor costs were not sufficient to identify "supply" and "demand" movements. Thus, policymakers had to rely on a wider array of variables to gauge the state of the economy. Regarding the second episode, an evaluation of core <b>inflation</b> <b>indicators</b> according to standard criteria suggests that no particular measure seems to be clearly superior to the others. Hence, the {{assessment of}} inflationary pressures should not rely only on one or few core <b>inflation</b> <b>indicators,</b> since some signals could be picked by some measures and not by others. Moreover, this result suggests that the analysis of core inflation measures must be complemented with a careful examination of the persistence of the shocks and a close monitoring of their impact on inflation expectations. It is found that the latter are formed on the basis of past inflation, but that the inflation target also plays a role. In addition, inflation expectations partially move with "supply" shocks, an outcome that reflects a degree of credibility of monetary policy.

The use of assumed prices for dwellings rather than actual prices for houses and the inclusion of a mortgage interest component make the CPI less sensitive than otherwise to housing price changes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the degree of {{persistence}} in five inflation indicators for Angola, and to identify the implications for decision-making. Understanding inflation persistence in Angola is crucial because the National Bank of Angola is preparing to change its monetary policy focus to a more inflation-targeting regime. Our results suggest that when structural breaks are accounted for, all five inflation indicators are stationary, so that a shock will give temporary effects. Secondly, our findings suggest that persistence is not too high. Moreover, the degree of persistence is similar among the five inflation indicators and throughout the sample period. Finally, our results also show that extracting the most volatile components of the headline <b>inflation</b> <b>indicator</b> does not generate a new <b>inflation</b> <b>indicator</b> that is less volatile and more persistent than the original. These results have important implications for the design, implementation and effectiveness of monetary policy in Angola, especially when following an inflation-targeting regime. First, a not too high degree of persistence means monetary policy aiming for price stability must be implemented with a permanent policy stance. Secondly, a low degree of persistence also means that inflation can be stabilized in a short period of time following a shock. Lastly, the results are also relevant for prediction and modeling purposes...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we argue that}} future {{inflation}} in an economy depends on the way people perceive current inflation, their inflation sentiment. We construct some simple measures of inflation sentiment which capture whether price acceleration is shared by many components of the CPI basket. In a comparative analysis of the forecasting power of the different <b>inflation</b> <b>indicators</b> for the US and Germany, we demonstrate that our <b>inflation</b> sentiment <b>indicators</b> improve forecast accuracy in comparison to a standard Phillips curve approach. Because the forecast performance is particularly good for longer horizons, we also compare our indicators to traditional measures of core inflation. Here, the sentiment indicators outperform the weighted median and show a similar forecasting power as a trimmed mean. Thus, they offer a convincing alternative to traditional core inflation measures.

40|$|Understanding {{inflation}} {{persistence in}} Angola is crucial because National Bank of Angola has approved in 2012 a new monetary policy operational framework which upgrades and expands {{the set of}} instruments to achieve its monetary goals. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to measure the degree of persistence of the headline, food, energy, underlying and 10 % trimmed core inflations for Angola and to identify its implications for decision-making. Using both a traditional univariate method and non-parametric approach, our results suggest the presence of a statistically significant level of persistence in five inflation indicators for Angola. Moreover, the degree of persistence is similar both across the five inflation indicators and also across the sample period. Finally, our results also confirm that extracting the most volatile components of the headline <b>inflation</b> <b>indicator</b> does not generate a new <b>inflation</b> <b>indicator</b> that is less volatile and more persistent than the original. These results have important implications for the design, the implementations and the effectiveness of the monetary policy, specialty when under an inflation targeting regime. First, since shocks tend to temporarily deviate inflation from its trend value a permanent policy stance is required. Secondly, a low degree of persistence means that monetary policy aiming price stability can only be implemented in a favorable setting with a permanent policy stance. Moreover, a low degree of persistence means that inflation can be stabilized in a short period time following a shock. Finally results are also relevant for prediction and modeling purposes.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{increasing}} use {{has been made}} in monetary policy analysis of the so-called Monetary Conditions Index (MCI). The index is defined as a linear combination of changes in a short-term real interest rate and in the real effective exchange rate, whose coefficients are equal to the estimated effects of the two financial variables on real aggregate demand or, alternatively, on a price index. The MCI is usually regarded as a measure of the degree of tightness of monetary policy in an open economy. In this paper the properties of the index and its possible uses in monetary policy are investigated by means of a macroeconomic model of the Mundell Fleming Dornbusch type; the reaction of the index to different kinds of aggregate shock is considered. Two possible meanings of the index are discussed: as a measure of the stance of monetary policy in an open economy and as an <b>inflation</b> <b>indicator.</b> It is shown that the index can be misleading in both cases. The MCI is ineffective in signalling changes in the stance of monetary policy in the cases of a financial shock and an exchange rate shock and it may also be misleading {{in the case of a}} supply shock. As an <b>inflation</b> <b>indicator</b> the index is also subject to some drawbacks in the case of real shocks. The MCI is to be properly interpreted as a summary measure of the inflationary pressures stemming from the short term real interest rate and the real exchange rate. An MCI constructed for Italy turns out to have been affected in recent years by the wide fluctuations of the lira exchange rate, which were mainly due to shocks originating in the financial and foreign exchange markets. ...|$|E
