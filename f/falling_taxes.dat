40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the impact of}} global crises in 2007 - 9 on Asian economies. Before addressing that issue, however, the first three sections argue that what is often abbreviated to GFC included three distinct crises: 1. a financial sector crisis, which was not global. The North Atlantic financial crisis of 2007 - 8 hit some small economies (Iceland, Ireland), but the big news was the USA and UK {{and to a lesser}} degree some other EU members. 2. recession in the USA and UK triggered a global economic crisis in 2008 - 9 3. public finance crises resulted from large bail-out or stimulus packages exacerbated by <b>falling</b> <b>taxes</b> due to recession (as in Ireland, USA, UK), or to some extent coincidentally (e. g. Greece due to culmination of budget deficits fuelled by cheap debt since joining the euro). If central banks are committed to low inflation, then increased budget deficits mean larger public debts and potential sovereign debt crises. An important distinction between the first two types of crises is that the effects of a financial crisis are much longer lasting than those of an economic crisis triggered b...|$|E
50|$|The fiscal {{soundness}} of {{city and county}} governments was challenged by the rise in relief expenditures and the sharp <b>fall</b> in <b>tax</b> collections. The Hoover Administration had encouraged {{state and local governments}} to expand public works projects, which they did in 1930 and 1931. While this expansion may have slowed the rise in unemployment, the spending was a luxury that could not be borne in the face of <b>falling</b> <b>tax</b> revenues and the unwillingness of investors to put more money into municipal bonds. After 1933, new sales taxes and infusions of federal money helped relieve the fiscal distress.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of {{lobbying}} by corporations when investments are irreversible and government cannot commit to tax policies. We show that industries which rely more heavily on sunk capital lobby more vigorously and are generally more successful in obtaining tax breaks. Thus lobbying can mitigate the capital levy problem. Nevertheless, these industries invest less in long-run equilibrium than more flexible ones. We then consider {{the effects of}} relaxing legal restrictions on corporate lobbying. When the deadweight costs of lobbying <b>fall,</b> <b>taxes</b> on sunk capital tend to fall, but political contributions may rise, as lobbyists compete more intensively for political favors. On balance, a ban of lobbying may therefore cause investment to rise or fall. ...|$|R

40|$|Tax {{rates on}} capital income, {{corporate}} income tax rates in particular, have been declining in most industrialized countries since the mid 1980 ies. Among the explanations for this development tax competition between countries for mobile capital has been mentioned frequently. A vast empirical literature dealing with tax competition for mobile capital has emerged. This paper gives a comprehensive overview of these empirical studies. A particular focus is put on studies modelling strategic interaction in tax policies of competing jurisdictions - {{which is at the}} heart of the competition concept. The paper also addresses the issue whether existing studies convincingly isolate tax competition as a driver of falling capital / {{corporate income tax}} rates. Given the empirical evidence surveyed it appears that <b>tax</b> rates indeed <b>fall</b> due to <b>tax</b> competition, in particular due to competition for new firms and for paper profits. However, closer look at the empirical approaches applied in the papers surveyed suggests that fully convincing evidence establishing tax competition as driver of <b>falling</b> <b>tax</b> rates is still lacking.

40|$|We {{explore the}} causes of the {{dramatic}} rise in employee contributions to health insurance over the past two decades. In 1982, 44 % of those who were covered by their employer-provided health insurance had their costs fully financed by their employer, but by 1998 this had fallen to 28 %. We discuss the theory of why employers might shift premiums to their employees, and empirically model the role of four factors suggested by the theory. We find that there was a large impact of <b>falling</b> <b>tax</b> rates, rising eligibility for insurance through the Medicaid system, rising medical costs, and increased managed care penetration. Overall, this set of factors can explain more than one-half of the rise in employee premiums over the 1982 – 1996 period...|$|R
40|$|The Philippine {{national}} government experienced large and unsustainable budget deficits in the 1980 s. After {{a brief period}} of near balanced budget in the mid- 1990 s, large budget deficits have reemerged in recent years.

50|$|When the Wall Street Crash of 1929 struck {{less than}} eight months after he took office, Hoover tried to combat the ensuing Great Depression by reassuring public {{confidence}} and working with business leaders and local government. As the depression continued, Hoover reluctantly gave into calls for direct federal intervention, establishing the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. He also reluctantly approved the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930, which sent foreign trade spiraling down.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{tax competition}} and tax harmonization {{in the presence}} of agglomeration forces and falling trade costs. With agglomerative forces operating, industry is not indifferent to location in equilibrium, so perfectly mobile capital becomes a quasi-fixed factor. This suggests that the tax game is something subtler than a race to the bottom. Advanced 'core' nations may act like limit-pricing monopolists toward less advanced 'periphery' countries. Consequently, integration need not lead to <b>falling</b> <b>tax</b> rates, and might well be consistent with the maintenance of large welfare states. "Limit taxing" also means that that simple tax harmonization - adoption of a common tax rate - always harms at least one nation and adoption of a rate between the two unharmonised rates harms both nations. A tax floor set at the lowest equilibrium tax rate leads to a weak Pareto improvement.

30|$|As {{noted in}} the Introduction, Ireland {{was one of the}} {{countries}} worst affected by the Great Recession, with output falling by over 10 % in real terms between 2008 and 2010 and unemployment more than doubling over the same period. The effects of the global recession felt elsewhere were compounded in Ireland by the bursting of a property bubble and the subsequent collapse of output and employment in construction-related sectors. Because bank lending was so highly concentrated in construction, Irish banks experienced huge losses and the government decided to guarantee all bank liabilities in 2008. However, continued <b>falling</b> <b>tax</b> revenue and exposure to bank liabilities resulted in the government deficit going from almost zero in 2008 to 13.9 % in 2010 and to a remarkable 30.8 % in 2011, when banking losses crystallised. As a result, yields in Irish bonds reached unsustainable levels in 2010, and the government sought and accepted a rescue package from the EU, ECB and IMF.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} nature of U. S. fiscal policy in the {{aftermath}} of 9 / 11. We argue that the recent dramatic fall in the government surplus and the large <b>fall</b> in <b>tax</b> rates cannot be accounted for by either the state of the U. S. economy as of 9 / 11 or as the typical response of fiscal policy to a large exogenous rise in military expenditures. Our evidence suggests that, had tax rates responded in the way they `normally' do to large exogenous changes in government spending, aggregate output would have been lower and the surplus would not have changed by much. The unusually large <b>fall</b> in <b>tax</b> rates had an expansionary impact on output and was the primary force underlying the large decline in the surplus. Our results do not bear directly {{on the question of whether}} the decline in tax rates and the decline in the surplus after 9 / 11 were desirable or not. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies {{productivity}} {{development of}} Finnish health centres in 1988 - 95 by applying different specifications of Malmquist index. As input variables we use operating costs {{or the number}} of personnel by employee category, and as output variables different kinds of visits, bed days and discharges. Measuring input use by operating costs gives more positive estimates of productivity change than those obtained by measuring inputs by the number of personnel. This suggests that productivity growth can partly be explained by changes towards a more efficient input mix in health centres. The choice of the base year had only a small effect on productivity change estimates. The results show that the productivity decline of health centres which was quite substantial all through the 1970 s and 1980 s reversed to a rise from 1990 onwards. The turn in productivity development occurred {{at the same time as}} the state and municipalities experienced severe financial difficulties due to recession and <b>falling</b> <b>tax</b> revenues.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to extend the dynamic {{resource}} allocation problem by including stock externalities like accumulated CO 2 and SO 2 emissions as well as flow externalities like waste of energy or pollutants which can be abated (SO 2). The objective is to examine how the evolution of energy-, CO 2 - or SO 2 -tax rates can address these problems in an optimal way. The concern about the time profile of an energy tax arises from the fact that fossil fuels are an exhaustible resource and that global warming, being a consequence of carbon accumulation in the atmosphere, is a stock externality problem. We use a micro model of a firm, which maximizes profits, uses energy as one of its inputs and is confronted with a varying energy tax. It reacts by substitution, by changing its output level, by investing in energy efficient technology or by purchasing abatement equipment. The government is well aware about firms reaction on price signals. It maximizes a stream of social welfare by choosing an optimal path of its instrument – an energy tax. Our analyses supports the idea of a first rising and later <b>falling</b> <b>tax</b> over time. ...|$|R
