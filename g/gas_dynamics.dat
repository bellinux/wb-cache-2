25|$|He {{attended}} Leningrad State University {{where he}} studied physics and mathematics, but found the specialty programs were not to his interest. He reportedly left without graduating in April, 1929. From 1929-1930 he pursued rocket research at the <b>Gas</b> <b>Dynamics</b> Laboratory. A new research section was apparently {{set up for the}} study of liquid-propellant and electric engines.

25|$|As {{discussed}} earlier, momentary attractions (or repulsions) between particles have {{an effect}} on <b>gas</b> <b>dynamics.</b> In physical chemistry, the name given to these intermolecular forces is van der Waals force. These forces {{play a key role in}} determining physical properties of a gas such as viscosity and flow rate (see physical characteristics section). Ignoring these forces in certain conditions (see Kinetic-molecular theory) allows a real gas to be treated like an ideal gas. This assumption allows the use of ideal gas laws which greatly simplifies calculations.|$|E
25|$|Patients who {{complain}} of bloating frequently {{can be shown}} to have objective increases in abdominal girth, often increased throughout the day and then resolving during sleep. The increase in girth combined {{with the fact that}} the total volume of flatus is not increased led to studies aiming to image the distribution of intestinal gas in patients with bloating. They found that gas was not distributed normally in these patients: there was segmental gas pooling and focal distension. In conclusion, abdominal distension, pain and bloating symptoms are the result of abnormal intestinal <b>gas</b> <b>dynamics</b> rather than increased flatus production.|$|E
40|$|Optimisation of mine goaf gas {{drainage}} design needs to fully recognise mine geological conditions, mining induced caving characteristics and <b>gas</b> flow <b>dynamics.</b> This paper presents the integrated geotechnical and gas field studies {{carried out at}} the Blakefield South mine for optimisation of longwall goaf {{gas drainage}}. A set of instruments including extensometers, piezometers, gas pressure gauges, tracer gases and borehole cameras were adopted in these studies. The overburden strata caving processes, coal seam pore pressure changes, multi-seam gas flow paths, goaf <b>gas</b> pressure <b>dynamics,</b> and drainage borehole stability were observed. The studies enabled a clear identification of the extent and characteristics of mining influence, sources of gas emissions in both the roof and floor and goaf <b>gas</b> flow <b>dynamics,</b> and {{have led to a}} successful design and implementation of an optimal goaf gas drainage system at the Blakefield South mine...|$|R

25|$|Rocketry in the Soviet Union {{also began}} with amateur societies, {{foremost}} was the Group for the Study of Reactive Propulsion (GIRD) headed by Friedrich Zander and Sergei Korolev. From 1931 to 1937 in the Soviet Union, extensive scientific work on rocket engine design {{occurred at the}} <b>Gas</b> <b>Dynamics</b> Laboratory (GDL) in Leningrad, which was merged with GIRD in 1933 bringing rocketry fully under government control. The well-funded and -staffed laboratory built over 100 experimental engines {{under the direction of}} Valentin Glushko. The work included regenerative cooling, hypergolic propellant ignition, and fuel injector designs that included swirling and bi-propellant mixing injectors. However, Glushko's arrest during Stalinist purges in 1938 curtailed the development.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the normal}} range of volumes of flatus in normal individuals varies hugely (476–1,491ml/24h). All intestinal gas is either swallowed environmental air, present intrinsically in foods and beverages or the result of gut fermentation. Swallowing small amounts of air occurs while eating and drinking. This is emitted from the mouth by eructation (burping) and is normal. Excessive swallowing of environmental air is called aerophagia, and {{has been shown in}} a few case reports to be responsible for increased flatus volume. This is however considered a rare cause of increased flatus volume. Gases contained in food and beverages is likewise emitted largely through eructation, e.g., carbonated beverages. Endogenously produced intestinal gases make up 74 percent of flatus in normal subjects. The volume of gas produced is partially dependent upon the composition of the intestinal microbiota, which is normally very resistant to change, but is also very different in different individuals. Some patients are predisposed to increased endogenous gas production by virtue of their gut microbiota composition. The greatest concentration of gut bacteria is in the colon, while the small intestine is normally near sterile. Fermentation occurs when unabsorbed food residues may arrive in the colon. Therefore, even more than the composition of the microbiota, diet is the primary factor that dictates the volume of flatus produced. Diets that aim {{to reduce the amount of}} undigested fermentable food residues arriving in the colon have been shown to significantly reduce the volume of flatus produced. Again, it is emphasised that increased volume of intestinal gas will not cause bloating and pain in normal subjects. Abnormal intestinal <b>gas</b> <b>dynamics</b> will create pain, distension, and bloating, regardless of whether there is high or low total flatus volume.|$|E
