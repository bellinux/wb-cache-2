5|$|The 1961 {{season was}} typical on the field: Jim Brown {{led the league}} in rushing for the fifth {{straight}} season and the team ended with an 8–5–1 record.

Milt Plum spoke out against Brown calling all the team's offensive plays, and Jim Brown said on a weekly radio broadcast that the coach's play-calling and handling of Plum were undermining the quarterback's confidence. They found a willing listener in Modell, a bachelor who was closer to their age than the coach's.|$|E
