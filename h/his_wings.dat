5|$|Once a male {{has found}} a mate, he selects a territory, marking the {{boundaries}} by warbling as he flies from perch to perch. After circling the perimeter, he performs two flight displays, first repeating a low, flat flight, then flying in an exaggerated version of normal flight, tucking <b>his</b> <b>wings</b> close to his body, plummeting earthwards and catching himself as he spreads <b>his</b> <b>wings</b> to glide upward {{in a series of}} loops. Two or three pairs may group their territories together in a loose colony, perhaps to aid in defense against predators.|$|E
5|$|Detailed to the Aviation Section of the Signal Corps, McClelland earned <b>his</b> <b>wings</b> by {{attending}} ground {{school at the}} University of Texas, flying gunnery and advanced fighter courses at Rockwell Field in San Diego, California. Then followed an assignment at Roosevelt Field, New York, and in December 1918, he became commandant of training, commanding officer of the cadet detachment and assistant engineering officer at Love Field, Dallas, Texas.|$|E
5|$|Icarus– The son of Daedalus, who {{had become}} insane and obsessed with finding the Sisters of Fate. Kratos {{encountered}} Icarus by the Great Chasm and attacked him. The two battled while falling down the chasm. Kratos eventually stripped Icarus of <b>his</b> <b>wings,</b> took them, and allowed Icarus to fall to his death into the Underworld. The character was voiced by Bob Joles in God of War II.|$|E

5|$|Born in Croydon, Cunningham was keen on {{entering}} the aviation {{industry as a}} teenager. Temporarily abiding his father's wishes to avoid the military, he approached the de Havilland company and was accepted as an engineering candidate. Concurrently, he joined the Royal Auxiliary Air Force and {{became a member of}} No. 604 (County of Middlesex) Squadron. Cunningham began his training in August 1935, flew solo in March 1936 and received <b>his</b> <b>wings</b> in 1937. He gradually became an established test pilot, gaining considerable flying time on different types of aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Brolgas are monogamous {{and usually}} bond for life, though new pairings may follow a {{fatality}} of one individual. A feature of a bonded couple is the synchronous calling which the female usually initiates. She stands with her wings folded and beak {{pointed to the}} sky and emits a series of trumpeting calls. The male stands alongside in a similar posture but with <b>his</b> <b>wings</b> flared and primaries drooping. He emits one longer call for every two emitted by the female.|$|E

5|$|By 1916, Minifie was {{residing}} in Elsternwick, Victoria. That year, {{he decided to}} postpone his studies and travelled to the United Kingdom where he enlisted in the Royal Naval Air Service at Crystal Palace, London on 11 June. Accepted for flight training with the rank of probationary flight sub-lieutenant, he spent the following six months at naval establishments in Eastbourne, Cranwell, East Fortune and Dover earning <b>his</b> <b>wings.</b> Granted the substantive rank of flight sub-lieutenant in October, he was posted to No.1 Wing RNAS on graduating as a pilot in October. In early 1917, he was allotted to the Wing's No.1 (Naval) Squadron in France, flying Sopwith Triplanes, an aircraft {{in which he was}} to score heavily.|$|E
5|$|Females are {{attracted}} by the booms of the competing males; they too may need to walk several kilometres from their territories to the arena. Once a female enters the court {{of one of the}} males, the male performs a display in which he rocks from side to side and makes clicking noises with his beak. He turns his back to the female, spreads <b>his</b> <b>wings</b> in display and walks backwards towards her. He will then attempt copulation for 2 to 14minutes. Once the birds have mated, the female returns to her home territory to lay eggs and raise the chicks. The male continues booming in the hope of attracting another female.|$|E

Bert recognizes what his costume is {{supposed}} to be and the two bond over playing StarCraft all day, ignoring everyone else. Dwight also makes Bert pretend to fire Toby, for taking away his weapons, on the grounds that he is the CEO's son.|$|E

5|$|King {{transferred}} to the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) on 13January 1917, and was posted to Britain to join No.4 Squadron AFC (also referred to as No.71 (Australian) Squadron, Royal Flying Corps, by the British) as an air mechanic on 18April. He was assigned to a training squadron for flying instruction in August. On 15October, he gained <b>his</b> <b>wings</b> and officer's commission. Allocated to No.4 Squadron in November 1917, King was posted to France for active duty on 21March 1918. The same day, the Germans launched Operation Michael, the opening phase of the Spring Offensive.|$|E
5|$|Less {{than two}} months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Miller was called to active service. He trained at No. 4 Initial Training School, Victor Harbor in South Australia, and gained <b>his</b> <b>wings</b> in late 1942. He played only one match during the 1942 {{football}} season, while posted in South Australia. In December, he was promoted to the rank of flight sergeant and, a month later, he sailed to Europe. The journey included a stopover at a training camp in Boston in the United States, where Miller met his future wife Peg Wagner. In March, he was deployed to Bournemouth, in England, where he continued his training.|$|E
5|$|Several {{courtship}} displays by superb fairywren {{males have}} been recorded. The 'sea horse flight', {{named for its}} seahorse-like undulations, is one such display. During this exaggerated flight, the male—with his neck extended and his head feathers erect—tilts his body from horizontal to vertical, and descends slowly and springs upwards by rapidly beating <b>his</b> <b>wings</b> after alighting on the ground. The 'face fan' display {{may be seen as}} a part of aggressive or sexual display behaviours; it involves the flaring of the blue ear tufts by erecting the feathers.|$|E

5|$|The Man-of-War (as it {{is called}} by the English) is about the bigness of a Kite, and in shape like it, but black; and the neck is red. It lives on Fish yet never lights on the water, but soars aloft like a Kite, and when it sees its prey, it flys down head {{foremost}} to the Waters edge, very swiftly takes its prey out of the Sea with his Bill, and immediately mounts again as swiftly; never touching the Water with his Bill. <b>His</b> <b>Wings</b> are very long; his feet are like other Land-fowl, and he builds on Trees, where he finds any; but where they are wanting on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The condor {{on top of}} {{the shield}} {{stretches}} <b>his</b> <b>wings</b> to symbolize power, greatness and strength of Ecuador. The condor also represents the idea that it will always be ready to attack any enemy. The shield is flanked by four national flags. The laurel on the left represents the victories of the republic. The palm leaf on the right side is a symbol of the martyrs of the fight for independence and liberty. The Fasces below the shield represents the republican dignity. The final design of the coat of arms was completed in 1900.|$|E
5|$|The male {{chooses the}} nest site, and uses {{it for his}} {{courtship}} display, spending much time calling nearby. When a female comes near a male at his nest the male begins to display by raising his head, drooping <b>his</b> <b>wings,</b> pushing his chest forward, and lowering his tail. He then bows {{up and down in}} front of the female, who will lunge and then fly away if unreceptive. Both sexes take part in building the nest, which consists of a loose, untidy bunch of dry grass which fills the nesting cavity, lined with fur and feathers for warmth.|$|E

5|$|He {{received}} <b>his</b> <b>wings</b> in {{the summer}} of 1936. He met Jimmy Rawnsley at this time, a 32-year-old electrical engineer who would later serve as aerial gunner and radar operator on all but three of John's successful air battles. Cunningham subsequently became a junior test pilot with de Havilland, working with light aircraft alongside Geoffrey de Havilland, the company founder's son and chief test pilot. The company was short of test pilots and Cunningham caught the eye of de Havilland as his flight experience grew. It was reflected by his promotion to flying officer on 5 December 1937. At this time John began to care more for test-flying than manufacture and design. He became one of four of de Havilland's top test pilots.|$|E
5|$|In December1941, {{just before}} the attack on Pearl Harbor, he went to Iowa City, where he enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Force (USAAF) Flying Cadet program with a recruiter. On January 17 of the {{following}} year, {{he was sent to}} Fort Des Moines and soon inducted into the USAAF. Not long after, he and other new inductees went to Minter Field in Bakersfield, California for more physical examinations, and then they went north to Visalia for primary training in January23. The class (which had to wear coveralls {{due to the lack of}} standard uniforms) first trained in Ryan PT-22 Recruits before moving back to Minter Field for basic flight training in BT-13 Valiants. Along with his brother Robert, who had also enlisted, Hagerstrom spent about six weeks in basic training. Hagerstrom and his classmates then went to Luke Field near Phoenix, Arizona for advanced flight training in the North American AT-6. On July 26, 1942, he was commissioned a second lieutenant and received <b>his</b> <b>wings</b> from Brigadier General Ennis Whitehead.|$|E
5|$|Males take up nesting sites {{before the}} {{breeding}} season, by frequently calling beside them. Unmated males start nest construction and call particularly frequently to attract females. When a female approaches a male during this period, the male displays by {{moving up and}} down while drooping and shivering <b>his</b> <b>wings,</b> pushing up his head, raising and spreading his tail, and showing his bib. Males may try to mate with females while calling or displaying. In response, a female will adopt a threatening posture and attack a male before flying away, pursued by the male. The male displays in front of her, attracting other males, which also pursue and display to the female. This group display usually does not immediately result in copulations. Other males usually do not copulate with the female. Copulation is typically initiated by the female giving a soft dee-dee-dee call to the male. Birds of a pair copulate frequently until the female is laying eggs, and the male mounts the female repeatedly each time a pair mates.|$|E
