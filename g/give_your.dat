Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times criticized the excessive flashbacks, but praised the action scenes and design, and considered that Marlon Wayans [...] "steals the show".

500|$|Five singles were {{released}} from the album. [...] "Young Love" [...] was the first. It received little notoriety on the principal singles chart, the Billboard Hot 100; {{it was able to}} reach a peak of number 64.

500|$|VideoGamer.com {{called it}} [...] "the best of its platform" [...] and [...] "a {{great example of}} the genre", praising its [...] "excellent plot and puzzles", and saying it makes good use of the DS' screens. However, the {{magazine}} stated that fans may miss the spoken dialogue. Official Nintendo Magazine UK praised the Wii version's puzzles, story, and art direction, and complimented the new hint system, finishing with: [...] "One of the best point-and-click games ever, this will appeal to both newcomers and fans". Gaming and technology journalist James Woodcock said of the iPhone version: [...] "There {{are quite a few}} point and click adventures to choose from on the Apple iTunes Store and Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars is one of the finer selections if not the best to <b>give</b> <b>your</b> heartfelt attentions to and best of all travels with you in your pocket." [...] He also praised its story, puzzles, writing and art direction. Slide to Play also complimented the iPad version, saying: [...] "Broken Sword: Director's Cut HD is a great game that nearly anyone can enjoy. Our one caveat is that if you played through it on the iPhone, then the HD version probably doesn't offer enough new content to warrant another purchase. But if you're new to the game or you haven't played it in a while, this is the version to get. The iPad truly is the ideal platform for adventure games." [...] BeefJack praised the PC version's, puzzles, story, characters, new content and interface, but stated that audiovisual quality of older scenes is noticeably [...] "ropey", that there are too many sliding tile puzzles, and that [...] "the new jarring transition between old and new aesthetics lets it down." ...|$|E
500|$|Trump officially {{released}} his book The America We Deserve on January 1. Dave Shiflett received credit as co-writer. To promote the book, Trump held a January 5 press conference at Trump Tower, which aired on C-SPAN. [...] He signed books and answered questions from reporters, once asserting, [...] "I {{may be too}} honest to be a politician." [...] Trump's book, consisting of 286 pages, covers Trump's political positions and policy proposals, including strict anti-crime measures, increased pressure on China, fair trade, border control, increased military spending, support for public capital punishment, and the implementation of single-payer health care. [...] It advocates eliminating soft money contributions to political parties and full disclosure of campaign donations to political candidates, but calls {{for the removal of}} limits on the amount of donations, arguing, [...] "f you want to <b>give</b> <b>your</b> life savings to Al Gore, that should be between you, Al Gore and your psychiatrist." [...] In addition, it raises concerns about terrorism, proposing the creation of a national lottery to raise funds for anti-terrorism programs, and offers a choice to North Korea to disarm or face military strikes. [...] The America We Deserve also includes praise for former boxer Muhammad Ali, Teamsters leader James P. Hoffa, as well as Trump's future political opponents Florida governor Jeb Bush and New York governor George Pataki, among others. It cites friendships with baseball player Sammy Sosa and entertainer Sean Combs as making Trump more understanding of racial diversity. Trump later backpedaled his book's praise of Combs after Combs was charged with violating gun laws following a shooting at a New York nightclub. [...] Trump said he did not [...] "know [...] really well." [...] The book condemns Congressman Jerrold Nadler as a [...] "hack" [...] for opposing Trump's development of waterfront real estate in Manhattan, and describes Senator Bob Smith as [...] "the dumbest guy in the U.S. Senate" [...] after he grilled Trump's sister Maryanne Trump Barry on abortion when she testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1999 upon her nomination to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. [...] It criticizes Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley as a [...] "phony" [...] for his Senate sponsorship of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 that purportedly hurt Trump financially. [...] It also notes the hypocrisy of both an unnamed Senator and an unnamed conservative columnist who each engaged in extramarital affairs at Trump's hotels and resorts while they attacked President Clinton for the Lewinsky scandal. [...] In a scathing review, New York Magazine described the book as inadvertently satirical. Booklist pondered whether Trump was [...] "the only man ever to run for president in order to promote a book." [...] Dave Saltonstall of the New York Daily News, labeled it as autobiographical and reported that it contains [...] "enough details to paint a fairly comprehensive picture of what a Trump presidency might look like." ...|$|E

Friendship with a non-lover, he says, demonstrates objectivity and prudence; it doesn't create gossip when you are seen together; it doesn't involve jealousy; and it allows for a much larger pool of possible partners. You will not be giving your favor to someone who is [...] "more sick than sound in the head" [...] and is not thinking straight, overcome by love. He explains that it is best to <b>give</b> <b>your</b> favor to one who can best return it, rather than one who needs it most. He concludes by stating that he thinks the speech is long enough, and the listener is welcome to ask any questions if something has been left out.|$|E
