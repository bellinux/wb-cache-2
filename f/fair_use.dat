This decision was questioned by some legal experts: Anthony Falzone of the <b>Fair</b> <b>Use</b> Project at Stanford Law School criticized Combs and Bad Boy for not defending the legality of sampling and suggested {{that they might have}} refused to raise such a defense because they feared it could later imperil their control over their own music.|$|E

5|$|The {{case set}} a legal {{precedent}} which has shaped copyright law {{to the present}} day. It established the common law doctrine of fair abridgement, which was cited in other cases, ultimately building up {{to the idea of}} <b>fair</b> <b>use.</b> The opinion also recognised the author's right to a work through the nature of the labour it took to produce it, shifting copyright away from publishing rights and towards the idea of serving the greater good by encouraging the production of new, useful works.|$|E
5|$|Freedom of Expression® is a {{book written}} by Kembrew McLeod about freedom of speech issues {{involving}} concepts of intellectual property. The book {{was first published in}} 2005 by Doubleday as Freedom of Expression®: Overzealous Copyright Bozos and Other Enemies of Creativity, and in 2007 by University of Minnesota Press as Freedom of Expression®: Resistance and Repression in the Age of Intellectual Property. The paperback edition includes a foreword by Lawrence Lessig. The author recounts a history of the use of counter-cultural artistry, illegal art, and the use of copyrighted works in art as a form of <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> and creative expression. The book encourages the reader to continue such uses in art and other forms of creative expression.|$|E

5|$|Gyles v Wilcox (1740) 26 ER 489 was a {{decision}} of the Court of Chancery of England that established the doctrine of fair abridgement, which would later evolve into the concept of <b>fair</b> <b>use.</b> The case was heard and the opinion written by Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke, and concerned Fletcher Gyles, a bookseller who had published a copy of Matthew Hale's Pleas of the Crown. Soon after the initial publication, the publishers Wilcox and Nutt hired a writer named Barrow to abridge the book, and repackaged it as Modern Crown Law. Gyles sued for a stay on the book's publishing, claiming his rights under the Statute of Anne had been infringed.|$|E
5|$|Reaction to {{the utility}} by Doom9 forum members, bloggers, and {{mainstream}} media has ranged from supportive to intensely hostile. By some, the circumvention of AACS {{was seen as}} a reaffirmation of <b>fair</b> <b>use.</b> Others felt that the utility {{was no more than a}} piracy tool and would bring about group punishment against consumers in the form of player revocation. One article compared proponents of BackupHDDVD to terrorists. When the release of the tool was first publicized, several articles claimed that AACS had been cracked. In fact no cryptographic weaknesses constituting a crack have yet been found in AES, the underlying cryptographic system of AACS. Keys are actually obtained through a side-channel attack.|$|E
5|$|Although Salinger {{tried to}} escape public {{exposure}} as much as possible, he continued to struggle with unwanted attention from both {{the media and the}} public. Readers of his work and students from nearby Dartmouth College often came to Cornish in groups, hoping {{to catch a glimpse of}} him. In May 1986 Salinger learned that the British writer Ian Hamilton intended to publish a biography that made extensive use of letters Salinger had written to other authors and friends. Salinger sued to stop the book's publication. The court in Salinger v. Random House ruled that Hamilton's extensive use of the letters, including quotation and paraphrasing, was not acceptable since the author's right to control publication overrode the right of <b>fair</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Church of Scientology {{strongly}} opposed the book's publication. The Church {{was accused of}} organising a smear and harassment campaign against Miller and his publisher, though it strenuously denied this accusation, and a private investigator involved in the campaign denied that the Church was his client. However, a leak of internal Church documents to the press in 1990 disclosed many details of the campaign. The Church and related corporate entities attempted to prevent the book's publication in court, resulting in cases that reached the Supreme Court of the United States, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales and the Federal Court of Canada. The U.S. Supreme Court's decision to let a lower court's ruling stand, denying <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> protection for the book's use of unpublished sources, set a precedent favouring copyright protection of unpublished material over biographers' freedom of speech. Courts in the UK and Canada took an opposite view, allowing publication of Bare-faced Messiah in the public interest.|$|E
5|$|The Washington Post {{columnist}} Dana Milbank {{wrote in}} his 2010 book Tears of a Clown, that Beck had been baited by Eiland-Hall to confirm {{the importance of the}} United Nations. Alexander Zaitchik came to a similar conclusion in his 2010 book Common Nonsense, and pointed out the discrepancy between Beck's criticism of the United Nations as part of a New World Order with Beck's subsequent reliance upon the WIPO where he chose to file the case. The case was cited by Jude A. Thomas in a 2011 article published in the John Marshall Review of Intellectual Property Law. In a discussion of the conflicts between freedom of speech and trademark, Thomas noted that panels of the UDRP have concluded website operators had <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> over domain names even in cases where the name in question was exactly the same as that trademarked by the individual filing the complaint to the WIPO.|$|E
5|$|The case {{established}} {{the doctrine of}} fair abridgement, which allowed that abridgements displaying {{a fair amount of}} labour {{on the part of the}} editor, and that differed from the original published work in a significant way, could not be copyright violations. This in effect raised the abridger to the level of an author. The decision did not define the exact parameters that would qualify a work as a valid abridgement. This distinction came with a later case involving an abridgement of Hawksworth's Voyages, in a decision written by Lord Chancellor Apsley. This concept of fair abridgement eventually evolved through common law, initiated from Gyles v Wilcox, into the current concept of <b>fair</b> <b>use.</b> Hardwicke's decision also added the exercise of personal judgement to the list of admissible defences against the charge of copyright infringement, adding to the growing case law establishing that British copyright would be based on labour and not on originality. The opinion advanced the position that copyright law should serve the public interest by promoting the creation of new educational and useful works, rather than focusing on publishing rights. The case played a significant role in the development of English copyright law. The United States federal courts have cited the case as recently as the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|Siva Vaidhyanathan, {{associate}} professor of Media Studies and Law at the University of Virginia {{has argued that the}} project poses a danger for the doctrine of <b>fair</b> <b>use,</b> because the <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> claims are arguably so excessive that it may cause judicial limitation of that right.|$|E

As content mining is transformative, that is it does not supplant the original work, it is viewed as being lawful under <b>fair</b> <b>use.</b> For example, as part of the Google Book settlement the presiding judge on the case ruled that Google's digitisation project of in-copyright books was lawful, {{in part because of the}} transformative uses that the digitisation project displayed - one being text and data mining.|$|E
