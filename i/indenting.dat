25|$|Two {{types of}} A-scan {{ultrasound}} biometry {{are currently in}} use. The first is contact applanation biometry. This technique requires placing an ultrasound probe on the central cornea. While this is a convenient way to determine the axial length for most normal eyes, errors in measurement almost invariably result from the probe <b>indenting</b> the cornea and shallowing the anterior chamber. Since the compression error is variable, it cannot be compensated for by a constant. IOL power calculations using these measurements will lead to an overestimation of the IOL power. In shorter eyes, this effect is amplified. The second type is immersion A-scan biometry, which requires placing a saline filled scleral shell between the probe and the eye. Since the probe does not exert direct pressure on the cornea, compression of the anterior chamber is avoided. A mean shortening of 0.25–0.33mm has been reported between applanation and immersion axial length measurements, which can translate into an error of IOL power by approximately 1 D. In general, immersion biometry {{has been shown to}} be more accurate than contact applanation biometry in several studies. The main limitation with the A-scan ultrasound is the poor image resolution due to the use of a relatively long, low-resolution wavelength (10MHz) to measure a relatively short distance. In addition, variations in retinal thickness surrounding the fovea contribute to inconsistency in the final measurement.|$|E
25|$|Fred Trueman {{opened the}} bowling and soon had Bill Lawry writhing {{as he made}} the ball lift off the rain-freshed wicket, but it was Brian Statham who struck first. He had Bobby Simpson out first ball, caught behind by wicket-keeper Alan Smith for a first ball duck to match Alec Bedser's record of 236 Test wickets. Ted Dexter crowded close fielders round the batsmen as Trueman and Statham {{continued}} their attack, but he noticed that their footmarks were <b>indenting</b> the soft pitch and after 45 minutes he replaced Trueman with Ray Illingworth and Statham with Fred Titmus. They failed to turn the ball, it wouldn't turn throughout the match, but the Yorkshireman almost had 3 wickets for 1 run. Lawry was bowled for 10, Illingworth (1/85) coming round the wicket with a straight ball to remove his off-stump. Neil Harvey had just made 231 not out against South Australia, his last innings in the Sheffield Shield, and was full of confidence. On 11 he snicked the ball to slip where Colin Cowdrey dropped a sharp chance and swung the following ball was to square-leg, where David Sheppard dropped an easy chance. On 26 he gave Cowdrey another chance in the slips, the waist-high ball dropped {{with his left hand}} off Dexter. Cowdrey finally took a catch to remove Brian Booth (34) off Titmus (2/88) after lunch for 101/3, but England failed to dismiss the out of form Norm O'Neill when he pushed a ball from Titmus close to Dexter's left hand at square-leg. Having survived Harvey and O'Neill set about the English bowling in the most attractive batting of the entire series. They added 194 for the fourth-wicket in 171 minutes and at five runs an over. O'Neill swept Titmus to the boundary, followed by two drives to either side of the wicket, and more from cuts through gully and point. Harvey danced down the wicket to hit Titmus for four three times in an over, and became the fourth batsman to pass 6,000 Test runs after Wally Hammond, Don Bradman and Len Hutton. He drove Illingworth through the covers in the last over before tea to bring up his 21st Test century, his 6th against England. But Dexter kept the suffering spinners on until the new ball arrived after tea. Trueman and Statham were exhausted and made no impression with the new ball, so Dexter bowled himself with Illingworth chipping in with medium-paced seamers from his youth. At {{the end of the day}} the tired batsmen gave themselves out to the tired fieldsmen, O'Neill reached his century in 169 minutes, the fastest of the series, with 14 boundaries, but was caught for 100 by Cowdrey off Dexter (3/94). Harvey cut the ball to Cowdrey off the England captain for 154 with 18 boundaries to leave Australia 302/5. Alan Davidson and Barry Shepherd took them to 322/5 overnight, but the England bowlers recovered in the morning and Australia crashed to 393 all out, losing their last 5 wickets for 71 runs. Brian Statham (3/66) had Shepherd caught in the gully by Trueman for his record 237th wicket to become the biggest wicket-taker in Test cricket. Trueman (1/54) had Ken Mackay caught behind by an agile Smith, Richie Benaud was bowled by Dexter, Davidson (46) was bowled by Statham and the unsafe hands of David Sheppard held onto a long, high skier from Garth McKenzie in the deep.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{seven years}} of {{research}} and experimentation at their Volta Laboratory, Charles Sumner Tainter, Alexander Graham Bell and Chichester Bell introduced wax as the recording medium and engraving, rather than <b>indenting,</b> as the recording method. In 1887, their [...] "Graphophone" [...] system, which recorded dictation on disposable cardboard tubes with a thin wax coating, was being {{put to the test}} of practical use by official reporters of the US Congress, with commercial units later being produced by the Dictaphone Corporation. After this system was demonstrated to Edison's representatives, Edison quickly resumed work on the phonograph. He settled on a thicker all-wax cylinder, the surface of which could be repeatedly shaved down for reuse. Both the Graphophone and Edison's [...] "Perfected Phonograph" [...] were commercialized in 1888. Eventually, a patent-sharing agreement was signed and the wax-coated cardboard tubes were abandoned in favor of Edison's all-wax cylinders as an interchangeable standard format.|$|E
2500|$|In 1880, Bell {{received}} the Volta Prize with a purse of 50,000 francs (approximately US$ in today's dollars) for {{the invention of}} the telephone from the Académie française, representing the French government. Among the luminaries who judged were Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas. The Volta Prize was conceived by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1801, and named in honor of Alessandro Volta, with Bell receiving the third grand prize in its history. Since Bell was becoming increasingly affluent, he used his prize money to create endowment funds (the 'Volta Fund') and institutions in and around the United States capital of Washington, D.C.. These included the prestigious 'Volta Laboratory Association' (1880), also known as the Volta Laboratory and as the 'Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory', and which eventually led to the Volta Bureau (1887) as a center for studies on deafness which is still in operation in Georgetown, Washington, D.C. The Volta Laboratory became an experimental facility devoted to scientific discovery, and the very next year it improved Edison's phonograph by substituting wax for tinfoil as the recording medium and incising the recording rather than <b>indenting</b> it, key upgrades that Edison himself later adopted. The laboratory was also the site where he and his associate invented his [...] "proudest achievement", [...] "the photophone", the [...] "optical telephone" [...] which presaged fibre optical telecommunications while the Volta Bureau would later evolve into the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (the AG Bell), a leading center for the research and pedagogy of deafness.|$|E
40|$|Medication {{turnaround}} time {{is defined as}} the interval from the time a medication order is written (manually or electronically) to the time the medication was administered. Monitoring medication {{turnaround time}} in inpatient settings allows organization to measure the impact of their efficiency of patient care. Objective: To trace the delays in the order and delivery system of In-patient pharmacy and check the average total time consumed in delivering drugs and medical consumables to the patients. Method: A time motion study was done in the in- patient pharmacy at a multi specialty hospital in Jaipur. A sample size of 300 <b>indents</b> was taken by using nonprobability convenient sampling method. Out of 300 <b>indents,</b> 56. 6 % were normal <b>indents,</b> 26. 6 % were new admission <b>indents</b> and 16. 6 % were urgent <b>indents.</b> Both primary and secondary data has been used in the study.
