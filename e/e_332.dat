40|$|The -secretase {{complex is}} {{responsible}} for the proteolysis of integral membrane proteins. Nicastrin has been proposed to operate as the substrate receptor of the complex with the Glutamate 332 (E 333 in human) serving as the anionic binding site for the a-amino-terminal group of substrates. The putative binding site is located within the aminopeptidase-like domain of Nicastrin. The <b>E</b> <b>332</b> is proposed to function as the counterpart of the exopeptidase Glu located in the active site of these peptidases. While <b>E</b> <b>332</b> could bind the a-amino-terminal group of substrates, we hypothesized, in analogy with M 28 -aminopeptidases, that other residues in the putative binding site of Nicastrin should participate in the interaction as well. Surprisingly, mutagenesis of these residues affected the in vivo processing of APP and Notch substrates only weakly. In addition, the <b>E</b> <b>332</b> Q mutation, which completely abolishes the anionic a-amino-terminal binding function, remained fully active. When we introduced the previously characterized <b>E</b> <b>332</b> A mutation, we found strongly decreased -secretase complex levels, but the remaining complex appeared as active as the wild type complex. We confirmed in two independent in vitro assays that the specific enzymatic activity of the <b>E</b> <b>332</b> A mutant was comparable to that of the wt-complex. Thus, <b>E</b> <b>332</b> crucially affects complex maturation rather than substrate recognition. Moreover other Nicastrin mutants, designed to either impede or alter substantially the putative binding pocket, affected only marginally -secretase activity. Consequently, these studies indicate that the main role of the <b>E</b> <b>332</b> is in the maturation and assembly of -secretase rather than in the recognition of the substrates. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) {{performs}} {{the first and}} rate-limiting step in the synthesis of catecholamines, which feed back to regulate the enzyme by irreversibly binding to a high-affinity site and inhibiting TH activity. Phosphorylation of Ser 40 relieves this inhibition by allowing dissociation of catecholamine. We have recently documented {{the existence of a}} low-affinity catecholamine binding which is dissociable, is not abolished by phosphorylation, and inhibits TH by competing with the essential cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin. Here, we have substituted a number of active site residues to determine the structural nature of the low- and high-affinity sites. <b>E</b> <b>332</b> D and Y 371 F increased the IC 50 of dopamine for the low-affinity site 10 -fold and 7 0 -fold, respectively, in phosphorylated TH, indicating dramatic reductions in affinity. Only 2 − 4 -fold increases in IC 50 were measured in the nonphosphorylated forms of <b>E</b> <b>332</b> D and Y 371 F and also in L 294 A and F 300 Y. This suggests that while the magnitude of low-affinity site inhibition in wild-type TH remains the same upon TH phosphorylation as previously shown, the active site structure changes to place greater importance on <b>E</b> <b>332</b> and Y 371. Changes to high affinity binding were also measured, including a loss of competition with tetrahydrobiopterin for <b>E</b> <b>332</b> D, A 297 L, and Y 371 F and a decreased ability to inhibit catalysis (Vmax) for A 297 L and Y 371 F.

PCC 6803 D 1 polypeptide mutant H <b>332</b> <b>E.</b> In the x-ray crystallographic structures of PSII, D 1 -His 332 has been assigned as a direct ligand of a manganese ion, and the mutation of this histidine ligand to glutamate has been reported to prevent the advancement of the OEC beyond the S 2 Yz• intermediate state. The manganese K-edge (1 s core electron to 4 p) absorption spectrum of D 1 -H <b>332</b> <b>E</b> shifts to a lower energy compared with that of the native WT samples, suggesting that the electronic structure of the manganese cluster is affected by the presence of the additional negative charge on the OEC of the mutant. The extended x-ray absorption spectrum shows that the geometric structure of the cluster is altered substantially from that of the native WT state, resulting in an elongation of manganese-ligand and manganese-manganese interactions in the mutant. The strontium-H <b>332</b> <b>E</b> mutant, in which calcium is substituted by strontium, confirms that strontium (calcium) {{is a part of the}} altered cluster. The structural perturbations caused by the D 1 -H <b>332</b> <b>E</b> mutation are much larger than those produced by any biochemical treatment or mutation examined previously with x-ray absorption spectroscopy.

The influence of filler concentration and surface treatment, especially the filler type, of particles on AC, DC breakdown strength and space charge has been investigated.

In this family of proteins, the sensor 1 and sensor 2 regions are important for their function and ATPase activity. Here, site-directed mutagenesis has been used to examine the role of these regions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdc 6 p in controlling the cell cycle progression and initiation of DNA replication. Two important amino acid residues (Asn(263) in sensor 1 and Arg(332) in sensor 2) were identified as key residues for Cdc 6 p function in vivo.

They further demonstrated that combining several identified mutations (e.g., S 298 A/E 333 A/K 334 A) resulted in enhanced ADCC relative to IgG 1 (Shields et al., 2001). Lazar et al. engineered {{a series of}} Fc variants with optimized Fcγ receptor affinity using computational design algorithms and high-throughput screening. The authors identified S 239 D/I <b>332</b> <b>E</b> and S 239 D/I 332 E/A 330 L as two variants with enhanced ADCC activity (Lazar et al., 2006). A crystal structure of an Fc fragment with the mutations S 239 D/A 330 L/I <b>332</b> <b>E</b> was solved and modeling studies suggested that additional hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic contacts, and/or electrostatic interactions resulted in enhanced binding to FcγRIIIa (Oganesyan et al., 2008). Richards demonstrated that the addition of G 236 A to the S 239 D/I <b>332</b> <b>E</b> mutations resulted in up to 70 -fold improved binding to FcγRIIa, a 13 -fold improvement in the FcγRIIa/FcγRIIb binding ratio (activating/inhibitory ratio), and enhanced phagocytosis of antibody-coated target cells by macrophages (Richards et al., 2008). Stavenhagen et al. utilized yeast surface display to identify the variant F 243 L/R 292 P/Y 300 L/V 305 I/P 396 L, which showed > 100 fold increased ADCC activity (Stavenhagen et al., 2007). Margetuximab, an anti-HER 2 mAb with these 5 mutations completed a phase I clinical trial for patients with HER 2 -overexpressing carcinomas (Bang et al., 2017). Mimoto et al. designed antibody variants with an asymmetrically engineered Fc domain by introducing different amino acid changes in each Fc domain. They screened ~ 1000 variants and demonstrated that L 234 Y/L 235 Q/G 236 W/S 239 M/H 268 D/D 270 E/S 298 A changes in one Fc domain and D 270 E/K 326 D/A 330 M/K 334 E changes in the other increased affinity for FcγRIIIa F 158 by more than 2000 -fold and FcγRIIIa V 158 by more than 1000 -fold (Mimoto et al., 2013 a).

40|$|Of the {{estimated}} 565, 650 {{people in the}} U. S. who will die of cancer in 2008, almost all will have metastasis. Breast, prostate, kidney, thyroid and lung cancers metastasize to the bone.

In particular, metastatic human prostate tumors express and cleave the integrin A 6, a receptor for extracellular matrix components of the bone, i. <b>e.,</b> laminin <b>332</b> and laminin 511.

Human tumor cells expressing either the wildtype or mutated A 6 integrin were placed within the living bone matrix and 21 days later, integrin expression was confirmed by RT-PCR, radiographs were collected and behavioral measurements of spontaneous and evoked pain performed. All animals independent of integrin status had indistinguishable tumor burden and developed bone loss 21 days after surgery.

N,N′-Dibenzyl- 1, 4 -diaminobutane (DBDB) is a substrate for PAO for which amine oxidation is rate-limiting. CFMS of the reaction showed formation of an initial imine due to oxidation of an exo-carbon−nitrogen bond. Nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the imine formed benzaldehyde and N-benzyl- 1, 4 -diaminobutane; the subsequent oxidation by PAO of the latter to an additional imine could also be followed. Measurement of the deuterium kinetic isotope effect on DBDB oxidation by CFMS yielded a value of 7. 6 ± 0. 3, in good agreement with a value of 6. 7 ± 0. 6 from steady-state kinetic analyses.

Because of individual differences in family background, body composition, activity, and the failure of some subjects to eat all of their food, these estimates are not exact, and energy balance is rarely achieved. Energy balance was correlated with fat balance in men (r = 0. 79, P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) and women (r = 0. 72, P 3 ̆c O. OOOl), and the slope of this relationship was not distinguishable from unity in men (1. 16 t 0. 18) or women (0. 80 +- 0. 15). There were no correlations between energy balance and either carbohydrate or protein balances. This study demonstrates that carbohydrate and protein stores are closely regulated by adjusting oxidation to intake. Thus fat, rather than carbohydrate or protein, is almost exclusively used or stored in response to day-to-day fluctuations in energy balance...|$|E
40|$|In the {{textbook}} view, {{the ratio of}} X chromosomes to autosome sets, X:A, is the primary signal specifying sexual fate in Drosophila. An alternative idea is that X chromosome number signals sex through the direct actions of several X-encoded signal element (XSE) proteins. In this alternative, the influence of autosome dose on X chromosome counting is largely indirect. Haploids (1 X; 1 A), which possess the male number of X chromosomes but the female X:A of 1. 0, and triploid intersexes (XX;AAA), which possess a female dose of two X chromosomes and the ambiguous X:A ratio of 0. 67, represent critical tests of these hypotheses. To directly address the effects of ploidy in primary sex determination, we compared {{the responses of the}} signal target, the female-specific SxlPe promoter of the switch gene Sex-lethal, in haploid, diploid, and triploid embryos. We found that haploids activate SxlPe because an extra precellular nuclear division elevates total X chromosome numbers and XSE levels beyond those in diploid males. Conversely, triploid embryos cellularize one cycle earlier than diploids, causing premature cessation of SxlPe expression. This prevents XX;AAA embryos from fully engaging the autoregulatory mechanism that maintains subsequent Sxl expression, causing them to develop as sexual mosaics. We conclude that the X:A ratio predicts sexual fate, but does not actively specify it. Instead, the instructive X chromosome signal is more appropriately seen as collective XSE dose in the early embryo. Our findings reiterate that correlations between X:A ratios and cell fates in other organisms need not implicate the value of the ratio as an active signal.

Physiological status of plants is monitored in conjunction with the sampling schedule outlined in Sevilleta Plant Demography. Several perennial life forms, including tree (Juniperus and Pinus), shrub (Larrea) and grass (Oryzopsis and Sporobolus), are being monitored at 1 - 3 of four sites which differ in elevation and topography as well as edaphic and annual precipitation characteristics. For the 1990 field season we are adding a spring annual, Lesquerella to our sampling efforts at these same sites. Currently, water status (xylem potentials, bars) is monitored twice a year, in spring (after the 'dry' season) and fall (after the 'wet' season). Three replicate measurements are made on each of 10 - 20 individuals per species per site. Three measurements are made at pre-dawn and midday to determine the diurnal range of values for each plant. For the 1990 field season, we will also be measuring peak photosynthetic rates for selected individuals by gas exchange measurements and porometry. Together with demographic data, this data set permits assessment of the physiological bases of plant growth and reproduction in response to short- and long-term changes in abiotic and biotic aspects of the environment...|$|E
40|$|Feline {{calicivirus}} (FCV) nonstructural proteins are {{translated as}} part of a large polyprotein that undergoes autocatalytic processing by the virus-encoded 3 C-like proteinase. In this study, we mapped three new cleavage sites (E 46 /A 47, <b>E</b> 331 /D <b>332,</b> and <b>E</b> 685 /N 686) recognized by the virus proteinase in the N-terminal part of the open reading frame 1 (ORF 1) polyprotein to complete the processing map. Taken together with two sites we identified previously (E 960 /A 961 and E 1071 /S 1072), the FCV ORF 1 polyprotein contains five cleavage sites that define the borders of six proteins with calculated molecular masses of 5. 6, 32, 38. 9, 30. 1, 12. 7, and 75. 7 kDa, which we designated p 5. 6, p 32, p 39 (NTPase), p 30, p 13 (VPg), and p 76 (Pro-Pol), respectively. Mutagenesis of the E to A in each of these cleavage sites in an infectious FCV cDNA clone was lethal for the virus, indicating that these cleavages are essential in a productive virus infection.

40|$|The Fc {{region of}} Immunoglobulin G (IgG) initiates {{inflammatory}} responses such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) through binding to activating Fc receptors (FcγRI, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIIa). These receptors are expressed {{on the surface}} of immune cells including macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells. An inhibitory receptor, FcγRIIb, is expressed on macrophages and other myeloid leukocytes simultaneously with the activating receptor FcγRIIa, thereby setting a threshold for cell activation. The affinity of IgG Fc for binding activating Fc receptors depends on IgG subclass and the composition of N-linked glycans attached to a conserved asparagine in the Fc C_H 2 domain. For example, Fc regions with afucosylated glycans bind more tightly to FcγRIIIa than fucosylated Fc, and afucosylated Fcs exhibit enhanced ADCC activity in vivo and in vitro. Enhanced pro-inflammatory responses have also been seen for Fc regions with amino acid substitutions. GASDALIE Fc is an Fc mutant (G 236 A/S 239 D/A 330 L/I <b>332</b> <b>E)</b> that exhibits a higher affinity for FcγRIIIa and increased effector functions in vivo compared to wild-type Fc. To explore its altered functions, we compared the affinities of GASDALIE and wild-type Fc for activating and inhibitory FcγRs. We also determined the crystal structure of GASDALIE Fc alone and bound to FcγRIIIa. The overall structure of GASDALIE Fc alone was similar to wild-type Fc structures, however, increased electrostatic interactions in the GASDALIE Fc:FcγRIIIa interface compared with other Fc:FcγR structures suggest a mechanism for the increased affinity of GASDALIE Fc for FcγRIIIa...|$|R
40|$|An alanine residue at the C-terminal tail of {{the third}} {{intracellular}} loop is highly conserved among various Gq protein-coupled receptors including rat cholecystokininB (CCKB) and neurotensin receptors. To investigate the functional significance of the conserved alanine in the activation of Gq proteins and phospholipase C (PLC) by CCKB and neurotensin receptors, the alanine residue was mutated in the present study. Subsequently, the ability of resulting mutant receptors to activate PLC was investigated by measuring the formation of inositol phosphates (IP) in COS- 7 cells and recording Ca 2 +-activated chloride currents from Xenopus oocytes. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to mutate alanine at position 332 of rat CCKB receptor to glutamate. When the (A <b>332</b> <b>E)</b> mutant receptor was expressed in COS- 7 cells and Xenopus oocytes, the efficacy and the potency of sulphated cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK- 8) to stimulate polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis in COS- 7 cells and evoke calcium-dependent Cl− currents in oocytes were not significantly affected. Alanine residue at position 302 of rat neurotensin receptor was also mutated to glutamate. When expressed in COS- 7 cells and Xenopus oocytes, the resulting (A 302 E) mutant receptor was strongly defective in stimulating phosphatidylinositol turnover in COS- 7 cells and evoking Ca 2 +-dependent chloride currents in oocytes. In summary, the present study demonstrates that alanine residue at the C-terminus of third cytoplasmic domain {{is required for the}} full activation of Gq proteins and PLC by neurotensin receptors. However, in contrast to other Gq protein-coupled receptors, alanine at the distal third intracellular loop does not {{play a significant role in}} CCKB receptor activation of PLC...|$|R

During the period, 175 specimens were collected with hand net and their gonadosomatic indices were obtained to know the spawning season. Digestive tract content of these specimens were examined and it was found that many conspecific eggs occur in the male digestive tract. The ratio of males which had eaten conspecific eggs and weight ratio of conspecific eggs to the total digestive tract content were obtained. The spawning season of the fish was considered to be from June through August from the gonadosomatic index analysis, but it was also pointed out that a part of the population reproduces in May and September. During the spawing season, the male exhibiting typical nuptial body color stayed within a very small territory of 0. 2 m^ 2 for more than two weeks Maturation of the females which had home ranges around the male territory was not synchronous, but a small proportion of the female population matured almost everyday. Male courtship behaviors included figure 8 swimming and circling. Most of the spawnings were done by pair of a male and a female, but multi-female spawnings were also observed. Collection of eggs from the male territory showed that the male is guarding two or three clutches {{at the same time and}} it also showed that the adhesive eggs which take relatively long time to hatch almost always present in the male territory.

40|$|Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TyrH) is a pterin-dependent {{mononuclear}} non-heme iron oxygenase. TyrH catalyzes the hydroxylation {{reaction of}} tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). This reaction {{is the first}} and the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of the catecholamine neurotransmitters. The active site iron in TyrH is coordinated by the common facial triad motif, 2 -His- 1 -Glu. A combination of kinetic and spectroscopic techniques was applied in order to obtain insight into the catalytic mechanism of this physiologically important enzyme. Analysis of the TyrH reaction by rapid freeze-quench Mossbauer spectroscopy allowed the first direct characterization of an Fe(IV) intermediate in a mononuclear nonheme enzyme catalyzing aromatic hydroxylation. Further rapid kinetic studies established the kinetic competency of this intermediate to be the long-postulated hydroxylating species, Fe(IV) O. Spectroscopic investigations of wild-type (WT) and mutant TyrH complexes using magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) showed that the active site iron is 6 -coordinate in the resting form of the enzyme and that binding of either tyrosine or 6 MPH 4 alone does not change the coordination. However, when both tyrosine and 6 MPH 4 are bound, the active site becomes 5 -coordinate, creating an open site for reaction with O 2. Investigation of the kinetics of oxygen reactivity of TyrH complexes in the absence and presence of tyrosine and/or 6 MPH 4 indicated that there is a significant enhancement in reactivity in the 5 -coordinate complex in comparison to the 6 -coordinate form. Similar investigations with <b>E</b> <b>332</b> A TyrH showed that Glu 332 residue plays a role in directing the protonation of the bridged complex that forms prior to the formation of Fe(IV) O. Rapid chemical quench analyses of DOPA formation showed a burst of product formation, suggesting a slow product release step. Steady-state viscosity experiments established a diffusional step as being significantly rate-limiting. Further studies with stopped-flow spectroscopy indicated that the rate of TyrH reaction is determined by a combination of a number of physical and chemical steps. Investigation of the NO complexes of TyrH by means of optical absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) techniques revealed the relative positions of the substrate and cofactor with respect to NO, an O 2 mimic, and provided further insight into how the active site is tuned for catalytic reactivity upon substrate and cofactor binding...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) {{performs}} {{the first and}} rate-limiting step in the synthesis of the catecholamines, dopamine, adrenaline and noradrenaline by converting tyrosine to DOPA. The catecholamines produce end-point feedback inhibition of TH, allowing for the control of cytosolic catecholamines in neurons and adrenal chromaffin cells. Catecholamines inhibit TH by binding to two sites; they bind irreversibly to the active site and will dissociate when the TH regulatory domain is phosphorylated at Ser 40, and they bind to another site reversibly, regardless of Ser 40 phosphorylation status. The location of this site had not been identified until now, and was shown to {{be located in the}} active site of TH, relying on <b>E</b> <b>332</b> and Y 371, which position catecholamine within the cofactor binding site, where it exerts its inhibition. These residues were found to play the same role in high affinity catecholamine binding, indicating that these two sites are colocalised. Since high and low affinity catecholamine binding occur simultaneously and produce stoichiometries of 1 mol catecholamine per TH dimer for the high affinity site, and 1 mol catecholamine per TH dimer for the low affinity site, it was hypothesised that these sites could not exist in the same active site, and may be spread across the tetramer of TH. Substitution of a residue at the tetramerisation interface (L 480 A), combined with a substitution of a residue involved in the dimerisation salt bridge (K 170 E) produced a pure dimeric species of TH that possessed both high and low affinity catecholamine binding sites. This indicated that the dimer is the core regulatory unit of TH for catecholamine inhibition. The high and low affinity catecholamine binding sites on TH were also explored by using another physiologically relevant catechol, salsolinol, which was shown to produce a more potent inhibition of phosphorylated TH than dopamine by producing a greater effect on cofactor binding. High affinity catecholamine binding was further explored by examining possible regulatory domain-interacting regions on the catalytic domain that are crucial for the irreversible binding of catecholamine. A 297, D 361 E 362 and E 365 were shown to mediate high affinity catecholamine binding, and, due to their location outside the active site, are likely to interact with the regulatory domain rather than catecholamine itself. This region of the crystal structure was then used for in silico screening of compounds, 11 of which were tested in vitro. Three compounds were found to be allosterically competitive with dopamine. One of the three activated TH moderately at high micromolar concentrations in the absence of dopamine, while the other two compounds markedly reduced activity in the absence of dopamine low micromolar range...|$|E

Manipulating the Fc-mediated functions of antibodies that engage immune effector cells, such as NK cells, represents a strategy to influence effector cell activation and to enhance antibody potency and potentially efficacy. We developed a novel approach to generate and ascertain the functional attributes of Fc mutant monoclonal antibodies. This entailed coupling single expression vector (pVitro 1) antibody cloning, using polymerase incomplete primer extension (PIPE) polymerase chain reaction, together with simultaneous Fc region point mutagenesis and high yield transient expression in human mammalian cells. Employing this, we engineered wild type, low (N 297 Q, NQ), and high (S 239 D/I <b>332</b> <b>E,</b> DE) FcR-binding Fc mutant monoclonal antibody panels recognizing two cancer antigens, HER 2 /neu and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4.

Subjects performed one-legged knee-extensor exercise for 10 min at an intensity of 30 W without (CON) and with (CUR) arterial injections of the non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent cisatracurium. In CUR, creatine phosphate (CP) was unaltered in slow twitch (ST) fibres and decreased (P < 0. 05) by 28 % in FT fibres, whereas in CON, CP decreased (P < 0. 05) by 33 % and 23 % in ST and FT fibres, respectively. From 127 s of exercise, muscle was higher (P < 0. 05) in CUR compared to CON (425 ± 25 (±s. <b>e.</b> m.) versus <b>332</b> ± 30 ml min− 1) and remained higher (P < 0. 05) throughout exercise. Using monoexponential fitting, the time constant of the exercise-induced muscle response was slower (P < 0. 05) in CUR than in CON (55 ± 6 versus 33 ± 5 s). During CUR and CON, muscle homogenate CP was lowered (P < 0. 05) by 32 and 35 %, respectively, and also muscle lactate production was similar in CUR and CON (37. 8 ± 4. 1 versus 35. 2 ± 6. 2 mmol).
