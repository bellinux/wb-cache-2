The Great Hyogoken-nanbu Earthquake occurred in 1995. Some facilities and piping systems were damaged due to ground displacement (settlement and/or lateral movement) induced by liquefaction. Having learned from the experiences, the seismic <b>design</b> <b>code</b> was amended in 1997.

25|$|Once the {{dimensional}} requirement for a structure have been defined, it becomes {{necessary to determine}} the loads the structure must support. Structural design, therefore begins with specifying loads that act on the structure. The design loading for a structure is often specified in building codes.

2500|$|It is {{conventionally}} {{believed that}} SSI is a purely beneficial effect, {{and it can}} conveniently be neglected for conservative design. SSI provisions of seismic <b>design</b> <b>codes</b> are optional and allow designers to reduce the design base shear of buildings by considering soil-structure interaction (SSI) as a beneficial effect. The main idea behind the provisions is that the soil-structure system can be replaced with an equivalent fixed-base model with a longer period and usually a larger damping ratio. Most of the <b>design</b> <b>codes</b> use oversimplified design spectra, which attain constant acceleration {{up to a certain}} period, and thereafter decreases monotonically with period. [...] Considering soil-structure interaction makes a structure more flexible and thus, increasing the natural period of the structure compared to the corresponding rigidly supported structure. [...] Moreover, considering the SSI effect increases the effective damping ratio of the system. [...] The smooth idealization of design spectrum suggests smaller seismic response with the increased natural periods and effective damping ratio due to SSI, which is the main justification of the seismic <b>design</b> <b>codes</b> to reduce the design base shear when the SSI effect is considered. The same idea also forms the basis of the current common seismic <b>design</b> <b>codes</b> such as ASCE 7-10 and ASCE 7-16. Although, the mentioned idea, i.e. reduction in the base shear, works well for linear soil-structure systems, it is shown that it cannot appropriately capture the effect of SSI on yielding systems. More recently, Khosravikia et al. evaluated the consequences of practicing the SSI provisions of ASCE 7-10 and those of 2015 National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP), which form the basis of the 2016 edition of the seismic design standard provided by the ASCE. They showed that SSI provisions of both NEHRP and ASCE 7-10 result in unsafe designs for structures with surface foundation on moderately soft soils, but NEHRP slightly improves upon the current provisions for squat structures. For structures on very soft soils, both provisions yield conservative designs where NEHRP is even more conservative. Finally, both provisions yield near-optimal designs for other systems.|$|E
2500|$|Damage {{sustained}} in recent earthquakes, {{such as the}} 1995 Kobe earthquake, have also highlighted that the seismic behavior of a structure is highly influenced {{not only by the}} response of the superstructure, but also by the response of the foundation and the ground as well. [...] Hence, the modern seismic <b>design</b> <b>codes,</b> such as Standard Specifications for Concrete Structures: Seismic Performance Verification JSCE 2005 [...] stipulate that the response analysis should be conducted by taking into consideration a whole structural system including superstructure, foundation and ground.|$|E
