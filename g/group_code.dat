Foss soon gained a reputation for aggressive close-in fighter tactics and uncanny gunnery skills. Foss shot down a Japanese Zero on his first combat mission on October 13, but his own F4F Wildcat was shot up as well, and with a dead engine and three more Zeros on his tail, he landed at full speed, with no flaps and minimal control on Henderson Field, barely missing a grove of palm trees. On 7 November his Wildcat was again hit, and he survived a ditching in the sea off the island of Malaita.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a problem of}} constructive description and justiﬁcation of the algorithms necessary for a practical implementation of the majority decoder for <b>group</b> <b>codes</b> speciﬁed as left ideals of group algebras. In addition to the algorithms needed to implement a classical decoder of J.

For use as a classical decoder of J. Massey and its generalization to <b>group</b> <b>codes</b> it was developed an algorithm for constructing decoding trees that lie at the core of these algorithms for majority decoding. Because <b>group</b> <b>codes</b> are deﬁned as left ideals of group algebras, the decoding algorithm for constructing decoding trees allows to build all decoding trees from one tree. On the basis of the generalized decoding algorithm it was developed an algorithm for decoding <b>group</b> <b>codes</b> induced on the subgroup. Application of the developed decoders was illustrated by an example of Reed-Muller-Berman <b>codes</b> and <b>group</b> <b>codes</b> induced by them on a non-Abelian group of aﬃne transformations. In particular, for Reed–Muller–Berman code description and justiﬁcation of the algorithm for constructing one decoding tree are provided. This three is used for constructing all decoding trees and then it is a built decoder for Reed-Muller-Berman codes and codes induced by them. </p...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two main areas: space-time coding for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless systems and <b>group</b> <b>coding</b> generated from affine reflection groups. MIMO systems, using multiple antennas at the transmitter and receiver, employ multiplexing to increase the rate and diversity to improve the performance and spectral efficiency of data transmission in wireless communications. Space-time coding has been developed to achieve high data rate and reliability in MIMO wireless systems. The research on space-time coding (in code designs, performance analysis, decoding algorithms and its applications) has been growing rapidly in past decade. We present systematic designs of full diversity unitary space-time codes with high <b>coding</b> gain, using <b>group</b> <b>codes</b> (permutation codes variant II and finite reflection <b>group</b> <b>codes),</b> the Bruhat decomposition and character tables of groups. We also analyze the pairwise error probability of space-time codes in a keyhole channel, and develop a fast optimization to the decision metric of multiple-symbol detection for differential unitary space-time modulation using a stack algorithm. <b>Group</b> <b>codes</b> generated from affine reflection <b>group</b> <b>codes</b> are related to high dimensional constellations, that is, lattice codes. High dimensional constellations have been studied widely for problems in communication systems, with priority on finding those with good minimum nearest-neighbour distance and simple decoding algorithm. We derive formulas for the initial vector and best minimum distance of affine reflection <b>group</b> <b>codes</b> of any rank. We also propose efficient decoding algorithms (from the geometrical analysis of groups and from their trellis diagram representations). This includes an original method to decode the codewords which lie outside the bounded region. Finally, we investigate their applications to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems to reduce a peak-to-average power ratio...|$|R
