5|$|Between 1910 and 1916, Hand {{tried to}} {{translate}} his political philosophy into political action. Having read Croly's The Promise of American Life and its anti-Jeffersonian plea for <b>government</b> <b>intervention</b> in {{economic and social}} issues, he joined the Progressive Party. However, he discovered that party politicking was incompatible not only with {{his role as a}} judge but with his philosophical objectivity. The pragmatic philosophy Hand had imbibed from William James at Harvard required each issue to be individually judged on its merits, without partiality. In contrast, political action required partisanship and a choice between values. After 1916, Hand preferred to retreat from party politics into a detached skepticism. His belief in central planning resurfaced during the 1930s in his growing approval of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, as he once again—though this time as an observer—endorsed a program of <b>government</b> <b>intervention.</b> Hand was also an interventionist on foreign policy, supporting U.S. involvement in both world wars, and disdained isolationism.|$|E

40|$|Whether city {{governments should}} {{intervene}} and provide public funds for building Municipal Wireless Networks (MWN) is a controversial and important issue.

40|$|China’s market-oriented {{reform has}} had great {{success in the}} past few decades. Along with the rapid {{economic}} growth of the country, the economic development also influenced various aspects of China’s social, economical, and political life. Recent debate has criticized the overheated market reform in social provision, thus arguing for the return of <b>government</b> <b>interventions.</b> However, in the health care sector, it is inappropriate to attribute all distortions to market imperfection. It is rather the design {{of the health care system}} and the lack of <b>government</b> <b>interventions</b> in regulating the health care market that obstruct the functions of health care provision. To examine the proposed hypotheses, the paper focuses on China’s medical care provision, evaluating the actual performance of China’s medical care provision in the environment of economic transition from a multidimensional analysis, hence providing forward-looking suggestions for the design of China’s health care provision.

40|$|Under what {{conditions}} can <b>government</b> <b>interventions</b> {{in the financial}} sector be a successful tool to increase the financial resources available for productive investment in sub-Saharan Africa? This is the question which drives this paper. The relevance of research on this issue is widely acknowledged: There is strong empirical evidence that access to finance for private investment is essential for enterprise development and economic growth. However, most financial systems in sub-Saharan Africa are highly exclusive and poorly developed in terms of size and efficiency. The lack of financial intermediation into higher levels of domestic investment primarily results from market failures which make the provision of financial services to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) prohibitively costly or unattractive. Historically and in line with welfare economic theory market failures have provided an argument for activism, defined as deliberate <b>government</b> <b>interventions</b> in the financial sector to promote the delivery of financial services to segments {{of the private sector}} that are underserved. The experience with activism has been mixed at best. However, even though activism does not guarantee an increase in broad-based productive private investment, past experience suggests that achieving this goal without deliberate <b>government</b> <b>interventions</b> is difficult, if not impossible. For this reason there is a renewed interest in the question of how far <b>government</b> <b>interventions</b> in financial markets could promote finance for development. This paper makes three main arguments...|$|R

5|$|Holden's second {{full-scale}} car factory, {{located in}} Fishermans Bend (Port Melbourne), {{was completed in}} 1936, with construction beginning in 1939 on a new plant in Pagewood, New South Wales. However, World War II delayed car production with efforts shifted {{to the construction of}} vehicle bodies, field guns, aircraft and engines. Before the war ended, the Australian Government took steps to encourage an Australian automotive industry. Both GM and Ford provided studies to the Australian Government outlining the production of the first Australian-designed car. Ford's proposal was the government's first choice, but required substantial financial assistance. GM's study was ultimately chosen because of its low level of <b>government</b> <b>intervention.</b> After the war, Holden returned to producing vehicle bodies, this time for Buick, Chevrolet, Pontiac and Vauxhall. The Oldsmobile Ace was also produced from 1946 to 1948.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, an American Roman Catholic layman Martin Quigley, {{editor of}} the {{prominent}} trade paper Motion Picture Herald, and Father Daniel A. Lord, a Jesuit priest, created a code of standards (which Hays liked immensely), and submitted it to the studios. Lord's concerns centered on the effects sound film had on children, whom he considered especially susceptible to their allure. Several studio heads, including Irving Thalberg of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), met with Lord and Quigley in February 1930. After some revisions, they agreed to the stipulations of the Code. One of the main motivating factors in adopting the Code was to avoid direct <b>government</b> <b>intervention.</b> It was {{the responsibility of the}} Studio Relations Committee, headed by Colonel Jason S.

Though these rates have eased to some extent in the recent months; with expected recovery of the economy and inherent supply bottle necks, the problem of inflation remains serious. This paper examines the price movements in rice and wheat, following structuralist principles emphasizing the necessity of long term solutions in combination with short and medium term management. However, unlike completely free systems, markets for these products are characterized by <b>government</b> <b>interventions,</b> calling for a slightly different approach under which interactions of demand and supply need to incorporate <b>government</b> <b>interventions</b> by way of minimum support price and procurement.

Building on the reputation cascade framework, a computational model with <b>government</b> <b>interventions</b> along the two dimensions of information and physical policies is developed. This model indicates that governments' that increase physical intervention policies face a tipping point where increases in physical intervention increase the level of terrorist support in a society. The optimal mix of information and physical policies is determined by the level of individual value for terrorism, the costs to terrorism, and the level of cohesion in a society. Thesi...|$|R
