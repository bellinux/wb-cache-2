50|$|The {{advantage}} of pictures over words is only evident when visual similarity {{is not a}} reliable cue; because it takes longer to understand pictures than words (Snodgrass & McCullough, 1986). Pictures are only superior to words for list learning because differentiation is easier for pictures (Dominowski & Gadlin, 1968). In reverse picture superiority {{it was observed that}} learning was much slower when the responses were pictures (Postman, 1978). Words produced a faster response than pictures and pictures did not have an advantages of having easier access to sematic memory or superior effect over words for dual-coding theory (Amrhein, McDaniel & Waddill 2002). Similarly, studies where response time deadlines have been implemented, the reserve superiroity effect was reported. This is related to the dual-process model of familiarity and recollection. When deadlines to the response were short, the process of familiarity was present, along with an increased tendency to recall words over pictures. When response deadlines were longer, the process of recollection was being utilized, and a strong picture superiority effect was present. In addition, <b>equivalent</b> <b>response</b> <b>time</b> was reported for pictures and words for intelligence comparison (Paivio & Marschark, 1980). Contrary to the assumption that pictures have faster access to the same semantic code than words do; all semantic information is stored in a single system. The only difference is that pictures and words access different features of the semantic code (te Linde, 1982).|$|E

5000|$|In 1974, Francis B. Colavita {{conducted}} an experiment, which provided evidence for visual dominance in humans when performing an audiovisual discrimination task. In his seminal experiment, Colavita (1974) presented participants with an auditory (tone) or visual (light) stimulus, {{to which they}} were instructed to respond by pressing the ‘tone key’ or ‘light key’ respectively. Throughout the experiment, unimodal auditory trials, unimodal visual trials and a small number of audiovisual bimodal trials were randomly presented. Colavita deceived the participants by informing them that the bimodal trials in the experiment occurred “accidentally”. During practice trials, Colavita would “accidentally” present audiovisual stimuli, and would then draw the participants’ attention to what had just happened and would apologize for such ‘accident’. In addition, the participants were not instructed on how to respond on such trials or whether this type of trials would occur again [...] The results showed that participants had almost <b>equivalent</b> <b>response</b> <b>times</b> for auditory and visual stimuli in unimodal trials. Additionally, Colavita found that participants pressed the ‘light key’ in the majority of the bimodal trials. This was seen as evidence of visual dominance because participants failed to acknowledge the presence of the auditory stimulus in most bimodal trials. However, due to Colavita’s deception of the “accidental” occurrence of bimodal trials, researchers have proposed that experimenter expectancy effects, task demands or methodological problems {{may have contributed to the}} visual dominance effect reported in Colavita’s original study. Nevertheless, subsequent experiments have discontinued the use of deception, and continue to show a robust Colavita visual dominance effect.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{industrial}} {{system is}} {{represented as a}} four-input, three-stage queuing network in this paper. The four-input queuing network receives orders from clients, and the orders are waiting to be served. Each order comprises (i) time of occurrence of the orders, and (ii) quantity of items to be delivered in each order. The objective {{of this paper is}} to compute the optimal path which produces the least <b>response</b> <b>time</b> for the delivery of items to the final destination along the three stages of the network. The average number of items that can be delivered with this minimum <b>response</b> <b>time</b> constitute the optimum capacity of the queuing network. After getting serviced by the last node (a queue and its server) in each stage of the queuing network, a decision is made to route the items to the appropriate node in the next stage which can produce the least <b>response</b> <b>time.</b> Performance measures such as average queue lengths, average <b>response</b> <b>times,</b> average waiting times of the jobs in the four-input network are derived and plotted.

40|$|People are {{extremely}} efficient at detecting relevant objects in complex natural scenes. In three experiments, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging-guided {{transcranial magnetic stimulation}} (TMS) to investigate {{the role of the}} extrastriate body area (EBA) in the detection of people in scenes. In Experiment 1, participants reported, in different blocks, whether people or cars were present in a briefly presented scene. Detection (d-prime) of people, but not of cars, was impaired after TMS over right EBA (rEBA; five pulses at â�� 200, â�� 100, 0, 100, 200 ms) compared with sham stimulation. In Experiment 2, we applied TMS either before (â�� 200, â�� 100 ms) or after (+ 100, + 200) the scene onset. Poststimulus EBA stimulation impaired people detection relative to prestimulus EBA stimulation, while timing had no effect during sham stimulation. In Experiment 3, we examined anatomical specificity by comparing TMS over EBA with TMS over scene-selective transverse occipital sulcus (TOS). Two scenes were presented side by side, and <b>response</b> <b>times</b> to detect which scene contained people (or cars) were measured. For people detection, but not for car detection, <b>response</b> <b>times</b> during EBA stimulation were significantly slower than during TOS stimulation. Furthermore, rEBA stimulation led to an <b>equivalent</b> slowing of <b>response</b> <b>times</b> to left and right lateralized targets. These findings are the first to demonstrate the causal involvement of a category-selective human brain region in detecting its preferred stimulus category in natural scenes. They shed light on the nature of such regions, and help us understand how we efficiently extract socially relevant information from a complex input...|$|R
