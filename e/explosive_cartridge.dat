40|$|Overburden strata {{movement}} in large space stope {{is the major}} reason that induces the appearance of strong mining pressure. Presplitting blasting for hard coal rocks is crucial for the prevention and control of strong pressure in stope. In this study, pressured water coupling blasting technique was proposed. The process and effect of blasting were analyzed by orthogonal test and field practice. Results showed {{that the presence of}} pressure-bearing water and <b>explosive</b> <b>cartridges</b> in the drill are the main influence factors of the blasting effect of cement test block. The high load-transmitting performance of pore water and energy accumulation in <b>explosive</b> <b>cartridges</b> were analyzed. Noxious substances produced during the blasting process were properly controlled because of the moistening, cooling, and diluting effect of pore water. Not only the goal of safe and static rock fragmentation by high-explosive detonation but also a combination of superdynamic blast loading and static loading effect of the pressured water was achieved. Then the practice of blasting control of hard coal rocks in Datong coal mine was analyzed to determine reasonable parameters of pressured water coupling blasting. A good presplitting blasting control effect was achieved for the hard coal rocks...|$|R
50|$|The Venom FB 1 was {{powered by}} a single 4,850 lbf (21.6 kN) thrust Ghost 48 Mk.1 {{turbojet}} engine; later marks were equipped with increasingly powerful models. The engine was ignited using <b>explosive</b> <b>cartridges,</b> known as Coffman engine starters; at the time, many operators were not previously familiar with such means of start up. Early production models lacked ejection seats, which was subject to official criticism; in response, later production models were furnished with them. The airframe itself had a relatively short life due to having been designed for {{its role as a}} short term interim aircraft; in Swiss service, where the type was subject to a lengthy service life, several strengthening modifications were performed to more than double its viable lifespan. It was known for its simplicity in construction and relative cost-effectiveness, which contributed to its popularity to export customers.|$|R
50|$|Currently an {{electric}} motor {{is the most popular}} choice to power stationary tools, though in the past they were powered by windmills, water wheels and steam. Some museums and hobbyists still maintain and operate stationary tools powered these older power sources. Portable electric tools may be either corded or battery-powered. Compressed air is the customary power source for nailers and paint sprayers. A few tools (called powder-actuated tools) are powered by <b>explosive</b> <b>cartridges.</b> Tools that run on gasoline or gasoline-oil mixes are made for outdoor use; typical examples include most chainsaws and string trimmers. Other tools like blowtorches will burn their fuel externally to generate heat. Compressed air is universally used where there is a possibility of fuel or vapor ignition - such as automotive workshops. Professional level electric tools differ from DIY or 'consumer' tools by being double insulated and not earthed - in fact they must not be earthed for safety reasons.|$|R
50|$|The Coffman starter was an <b>explosive</b> <b>cartridge</b> {{operated}} device, {{the burning}} gases either operating {{directly in the}} cylinders to rotate the engine or operating through a geared drive.

Other appointments included; Dean of Air Force Medicine from 1985 to 1987, The Queen's Honorary Physician from 1982 to 1988 and that of Royal Air Force's Senior Consultant from 1987 to 1988. Howard gained some notoriety in 1962, as {{the first man to}} test the world's first rocket-powered ejector seat, developed by the Martin-Baker company.

5000|$|The 6-inch guns used [...] "non-fixed ammunition", that is, the <b>explosive</b> <b>cartridge</b> that {{propelled}} {{the shell}} was stored and loaded {{separately from the}} shell or shot. Cartridges were made of raw silk, and stored in wooden crates in a special high-security section of the underground magazine. There were five types of shell on the Fort Rodd manifest in 1897: High Explosive (Lyddite), Armour-piercing, Common Pointed (for non-armoured maritime targets), and Shrapnel. The other class of projectile (and the one most often fired) was a solid steel shot (without any cavity for explosives or fuses, it was cheapest to produce). The shells and shot all had the same service weight of 94 pounds (to simplify calculation of elevation and depression) and diameter of 6 in; therefore, lengths of the various types varied.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the first}} {{operational}} military jet in late 1944 to ever feature one, the lightweight Heinkel He 162A Spatz featured {{a new type}} of ejection seat, this time fired by an <b>explosive</b> <b>cartridge.</b> In this system, the seat rode on wheels set between two pipes running up the back of the cockpit. When lowered into position, caps {{at the top of the}} seat fitted over the pipes to close them. Cartridges, basically identical to shotgun shells, were placed in the bottom of the pipes, facing upward. When fired, the gases would fill the pipes, [...] "popping" [...] the caps off the end, and thereby forcing the seat to ride up the pipes on its wheels and out of the aircraft. By the end of the war, the Dornier Do 335 Pfeil — primarily from it having a rear-mounted engine (of the twin engines powering the design) powering a pusher propeller located at the aft end of the fuselage presenting a hazard to a normal [...] "bailout" [...] escape — and a few late-war prototype aircraft were also fitted with ejection seats.|$|E

It extended out on the New Powder Pier in a double line. The rails were made of delta metal, an alloy of copper and zinc, (brass) plus a little iron, as a precaution against sparks; they were grooved rails (set flush with ground level). In 1904 it had 78 trucks. In time it was largely superseded by the [...] narrow gauge line; but part continued in use inside some workshops and stores to about 1960.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{economic}} gain {{the use of}} explosives for rock breaking has been the preferred choice in the mining industry for extracting minerals and the construction industries for driving tunnels and underground excavations. Although misfires are not an expected outcome in any form of blasting operations, however, due to the confined nature of underground blast the likelihood of blasthole misfires occurring is increased {{compared to that of}} a surface blast. Past research on the use of explosives for rock breaking have been concerned with issues about improving the effective use of explosive energy neglecting such effect as safety hazards and increased operational cost resulting from blasthole misfires. This research project investigate misfires in tunnel blasts with the aim of developing method(s) of minimising it occurrence during the blast design and identify blasthole misfires should they occur. Through a series of test blasts carried out at the Holman’s Test Mine operated by the Camborne School of Mines, three identification techniques based on blast emission data were developed namely; Electro-Magnetic Pulse (EMP Signature), Light (Optical Signature) and seismic (Vibration Signature). The study therefore concluded that whilst no one single method developed could effectively identify blasthole misfires in tunnel blasts, the vibration signature approach is the most pragmatic method for misfire identification in tunnel blasts as measurements are remotely undertaken. Moreover, blast vibration is well understood and part of almost all tunnel blasting operation. The blast vibration measurements and analyses undertaken {{during the course of this}} research resulted in the identification of potential blasthole misfires and aided in the safe retrieval of unexploded detonators and <b>explosives</b> <b>cartridges.</b> As a result of the research project several misfires were identified immediately after full face tunnel blasts at the Holmans’ Test Mine and appropriate measures taken to handle the misfires.

50|$|Either an {{electrical}} starter or an air-start system {{is used to}} start the engine turning. On large engines, pre-lubrication and slow turning of an engine, as well as heating, are required to minimise the amount of engine damage during initial start-up and running. Some smaller military diesels can be started with an <b>explosive</b> <b>cartridge,</b> called a Coffman starter, which provides the extra power required to get the machine turning. In the past, Caterpillar and John Deere used a small petrol pony engine in their tractors to start the primary diesel engine. The pony engine heated the diesel to aid in ignition and used a small clutch and transmission to spin up the diesel engine. Even more unusual was an International Harvester design in which the diesel engine had its own carburetor and ignition system, and started on petrol. Once warmed, the operator moved two levers to switch the engine to diesel operation, and work could begin. These engines had very complex cylinder heads, with their own petrol combustion chambers, and were vulnerable to expensive damage if special care was not taken (especially in letting the engine cool before turning it off).|$|E

50|$|Centerfire {{cartridges}} {{are more}} reliable {{for military purposes}} because the thicker metal cartridge cases can withstand rougher handling without damage, and safer to handle because explosive priming compound in a protruding rim {{is more likely to}} be triggered by impact if a rimfire cartridge is dropped or pinched. The stronger base of a centerfire cartridge is able to withstand higher pressures which in turn give a bullet greater velocity and energy. While centerfire cartridge cases require a complex and expensive manufacturing process, explosive handling is simplified by avoiding the spinning process required to uniformly distribute priming explosive into the rim because of uncertainty about which angular segment of a rimfire cartridge rim will be struck by the firing pin. Larger caliber rimfire cartridges require greater volumes of priming <b>explosive</b> than centerfire <b>cartridges,</b> and the required volume may cause an undesirably high pressure during ignition. Reducing the amount of priming explosive would reduce the reliability of rimfire cartridge ignition, and increase the probability of misfire or dud cartridges.|$|R
