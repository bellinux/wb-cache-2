25|$|It has {{generally}} been accepted that tectonic plates are able to move because of the relative density of oceanic lithosphere and the relative weakness of the asthenosphere. Dissipation of heat from the mantle is acknowledged to be the original source of the energy required to drive plate tectonics through convection or large scale upwelling and doming. The current view, though still {{a matter of some}} debate, asserts that as a consequence, a powerful source of plate motion is generated due to the excess density of the oceanic lithosphere sinking in subduction zones. When the new crust forms at mid-ocean ridges, this oceanic lithosphere is initially less dense than the underlying asthenosphere, but it becomes denser with age as it conductively cools and thickens. The greater density of old lithosphere relative to the underlying asthenosphere allows it to sink into the deep mantle at subduction zones, providing most of the driving force for plate movement. The weakness of the asthenosphere allows the tectonic plates to move easily towards a subduction zone. Although subduction is thought to be the strongest force <b>driving</b> <b>plate</b> motions, it cannot be the only force since there are plates such as the North American Plate which are moving, yet are nowhere being subducted. The same is true for the enormous Eurasian Plate. The sources of plate motion are a matter of intensive research and discussion among scientists. One of the main points is that the kinematic pattern of the movement itself should be separated clearly from the possible geodynamic mechanism that is invoked as the driving force of the observed movement, as some patterns may be explained by more than one mechanism.

It is characterized by streamwise inflow towards the spot and spanwise outflow from the spot, giving it a quadrupolar shape. A correction to the base flow is present within the spot {{in the form of a}} spanwise vortex with vorticity opposite in sign to that of the base flow. The Reynolds stresses are shown to be at the origin of this recirculation, whereas the quadrupolar shape of the in-plane flow results from the transport of this recirculation by the base flow that pumps it towards the spot in the streamwise direction and flushes it in the spanwise direction to insure mass conservation. These results shed light on earlier observations in plane Couette flow or other wall flows experiencing a direct transition to turbulence by spot nucleation. ...|$|R

2500|$|Several {{forces are}} {{involved}} in the process of slab rollback. Two forces acting against each other at the interface of the two subducting plates exert forces against one another. The subducting plate exerts a bending force (FPB) that supplies pressure during subduction, while the overriding plate exerts a force against the subducting plate (FTS). The slab pull force (FSP) is caused by the negative buoyancy of the <b>plate</b> <b>driving</b> the <b>plate</b> to greater depths. The resisisting force from the surrounding mantle opposes the slab pull forces. Interactions with the 660-km discontinuity cause a deflection due to the buoyancy at the phase transition (F660). [...] The unique interplay of these forces is what generates slab rollback. When the deep slab section obstructs the down-going motion of the shallow slab section, slab rollback occurs. The subducting slab undergoes backward sinking due to the negative buoyancy forces causing a retrogradation of the trench hinge along the surface. Upwelling of the mantle around the slab can create favorable conditions for the formation of a back-arc basin.|$|R
40|$|The two {{convective}} {{systems that}} dominate Earth’s internal dynamics {{meet at the}} boundary between the rocky mantle and metallic liquid core. Energy transfer between processes <b>driving</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics and the geodynamo is controlled by thermal conduction in the lowermost mantle (D′′). We use atomic scale simulations to determine the thermal conductivity of MgSiO 3 perovskite and post-perovskite under D′′ conditions and probe how these two convective systems interact. We show that the thermal conductivity of post-perovskite (~ 12 W/mK) is 50 % larger than that of perovskite under the same conditions (~ 8. 5 W/mK) and is anisotropic, with conductivity along the a-axis being 40 % higher than conductivity along the c-axis. This enhances the high heat flux into cold regions of D′′ where post-perovskite is stable, strengthening the feedback between convection in the core and mantle. Reminiscent of the situation in the lithosphere, there is potential for deformation induced texturing associated with mantle convection to modify how the mantle is heated from below. We test this by coupling our atomic scale results to models of texture in D′′ and suggest that anisotropic thermal conductivity may help to stabilise the roots of mantle plumes over their protracted lifetime...|$|E
40|$|One way or another, {{the mantle}} convects. There is still {{discussion}} {{about whether the}} mode is whole mantle or layered {{and if it is}} driven primarily from the top. Radioactivity, secular cooling and strong plates influence convection and cause upwellings to be broad and migratory. Pressure and compositional effects cause the deep mantle to have very broad features. In any case, broad upwellings exist in the mantle, if only to replace the sinking slabs or to get rid of internal radioactive heat. These upwellings would exist even if the mantle were not heated from below and even if there were no lower thermal boundary layer (TBL). In the fluid dynamic literature buoyant upwellings are called plumes. It was suggested that plate tectonics and normal mantle convection could not explain hotspots, melting anomalies and volcanic chains because normal mantle was too cold. A different small-scale mode of convection was proposed (Morgan, 1971). The defining characteristics of mantle plumes have changed with time but great depth, a TBL origin, high temperatures, rapid ascent rates, and low viscosity are the invariants. Initially, mantle plumes were treated as fixed, whole-mantle, chemically primitive or enriched and responsible for lifting and breaking continents and for <b>driving</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics.

40|$|The {{buoyancy}} of lithospheric slabs in subduction zones {{is widely}} thought {{to dominate the}} torques <b>driving</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics. In late Cretaceous and early Paleogene times, the Indian plate moved more rapidly over the mantle than freely subducting slabs sink within it. This signal event {{has been attributed to}} arrival of the Deccan–Réunion mantle plume beneath the plate, but it is unknown in which proportions the plume acted to alter the balance of existing plate driving torques and to introduce torques of its own. Our plate kinematic analysis of the Mascarene Basin yields a detailed Indian plate motion history for the period 89 – 60 [*]Ma. Plate speed initially increases steadily until a pronounced acceleration in the period 68 – 64 [*]Ma, after which it abruptly returns to values much like those beforehand. This pattern is unlike that suggested to result from the direct introduction of driving forces by the arrival of a thermal plume {{at the base of the}} plate. A simple analysis of the gravitational force related to the Indian plate's thickening away from its boundary with the African plate suggests instead that the sudden acceleration and deceleration may be related to uplift of part of that boundary during a period when it was located over the plume head. In this instance, torques related to plate accretion and subduction may have contributed in similar proportions to drive plate motion...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} <b>driving</b> <b>plate</b> {{motion and}} the Earth’s geodynamics {{are still not}} entirely clari␣ed. Lithospheric volumes recycled at subduction zones or emerging at rift zones testify mantle convection. The cooling of the planet and the related density gradients are invoked to explain mantle convection either driven from the hot interior or from the cooler outer boundary layer. In this paper we summarize a number of evidence sup- porting generalized asymmetries along the plate boundaries that point to a polariza- tion of plate tectonics. W-directed slabs provide {{two to three times}} larger volumes to the mantle with respect to the opposite E- or NE-directed subduction zones. W-directed slabs are deeper and steeper, usually characterized by down-dip compres- sion. Moreover, they show a shallow decollement and low elevated accretionary prism, a steep regional monocline with a deep trench or foredeep, a backarc basin with high heat ␣ow and positive gravity anomaly. Conversely directed subduction zones show antithetic signatures and no similar backarc basin. Rift zones also show an asymmetry, e. g., faster Vs in the western lithosphere and a slightly deeper bathymetry with respect to the eastern ␣ank. These evidences can be linked to the westward drift of the lithosphere relative to the underlying mantle and may explain the differences among subduction and rift zones as a function of their geographic polarity with respect to the “tectonic equator. ” Therefore also mantle convection and plate motion should be polar- ized. All this supports a general tuning of the Earth’s geodynamics and mantle convec- tion by astronomical forces...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we analyse the {{distributions}} of {{number of events}} (N) and seismic energy (E) on the Earth's surface and along its radius as obtained from the global declustered catalogue of large independent events (M >= 7. 0), dissipating about 95 % of the Earth's elastic budget. The latitude distribution of the seismic event density is almost symmetric {{with respect to the}} equator and the seismic energy flux distribution is bimodal: both have their medians near the equator so that they are equally distributed in the two hemispheres. This symmetry with respect to the equator suggests that the Earth's rotational dynamics contributes to modulate the long-term tectonic processes. The {{distributions of}} number and energy of earthquakes versus depth are not uniform as well: 76 % of the total earthquakes dissipates about 60 % of the total energy in the first similar to 50 km; only 6 % of events dissipates about 20 % of the total amount of energy in a narrow depth interval, at the lower boundary of the upper mantle (550 - 680 km). Therefore, only the remaining 20 % of energy is released along most of the depth extent of subduction zones (50 - 550 km). Since the energetic release along slabs is a minor fraction of the total seismic budget, the role of the slab pull appears as ancillary, if any, in <b>driving</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics. Moreover the concentration of seismic release in the not yet subducted lithosphere suggests that the force moving the plates acts on the uppermost lithosphere and contemporaneously all over the Earth's outer shell, again supporting a rotational/tidal modulation.

The thickness of the cylindrical samples is varied between 6, 12, 24, and 75 mm with a constant diameter of 3 inches.
