40|$|<b>Growing</b> <b>plants</b> without soil is not new. Man started {{agricultural}} pur-suits by <b>growing</b> <b>plants</b> in soil but as {{the knowledge}} of plant nutrition increased, he learned to <b>grow</b> <b>plants</b> in artificial media, such as quartz, sand, gravel, etc. The {{next step was to}} eliminate solid media and to <b>grow</b> <b>plants</b> directly in solutions. By 1860 the principles of <b>growing</b> <b>plants</b> in solution were well understood, and satisfactory solutions for supplying nutrients to plants were developed. It was not until 1929, however, that the commercial possibilities of this method were realized. The idea of <b>growing</b> <b>plants</b> in solution instantly became popular, and many articles about it appeared in popular media. Many exaggerated and wholly un-found claims were made for this method of <b>growing</b> <b>plants.</b> This interest has been maintained until this day. This circular is intended to supply information on <b>growing</b> <b>plants</b> without soil. Principles of <b>Growing</b> <b>Plants</b> Without Soil A knowledge of the principles of plant physiology and horticulture or agronomy involv~d in crop production is necessary for <b>growing</b> <b>plants</b> in the soil or without soil. By supplying nutrients and water to plants, only two of the physiological process of the plant are satisfied. The sig-nificance of other interrelated processes must be understood, especially photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration, and reproduction. In addition, when establishing an installation for growing without soils, many prob-lems of engineering and economics must be considered as well. ...|$|R

25|$|In {{taking a}} cutting, {{part of a}} <b>growing</b> <b>plant</b> is cut off {{and placed in a}} growing medium to develop roots. If the part that is cut off is fairly thick, like a mature branch, it can be grown into an aged-looking bonsai more quickly than can a seed. Unfortunately, thinner and younger {{cuttings}} tend to strike roots more easily than thicker or more mature ones. In bonsai propagation, cuttings usually provide source material to be grown for some time before training.|$|E
500|$|In plant {{physiology}} research interest {{was focused on}} the movement of sap and the absorption of substances through the roots. Jan Helmont (1577–1644) by experimental observation and calculation, noted that the increase in weight of a <b>growing</b> <b>plant</b> cannot be derived purely from the soil, and concluded it must relate to water uptake. Englishman Stephen Hales (1677–1761) established by quantitative experiment that there is uptake of water by plants and a loss of water by transpiration and that this is influenced by environmental conditions: he distinguished [...] "root pressure", [...] "leaf suction" [...] and [...] "imbibition" [...] and also noted that the major direction of sap flow in woody tissue is upward. His results were published in Vegetable Staticks (1727) He also noted that [...] "air makes a very considerable part of the substance of vegetables". English chemist Joseph Priestley (1733–1804) is noted for his discovery of oxygen (as now called) and its production by plants. Later Jan Ingenhousz (1730–1799) observed that only in sunlight do the green parts of plants absorb air and release oxygen, this being more rapid in bright sunlight while, at night, the air (CO2) is released from all parts. His results were published in Experiments upon vegetables (1779) and with this the foundations for 20th century studies of carbon fixation were laid. From his observations he sketched the cycle of carbon in nature even though the composition of carbon dioxide was yet to be resolved. Studies in plant nutrition had also progressed. In 1804 Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure's (1767–1845) [...] was an exemplary study of scientific exactitude that demonstrated the similarity of respiration in both plants and animals, that the fixation of carbon dioxide includes water, and that just minute amounts of salts and nutrients (which he analysed in chemical detail from plant ash) have a powerful influence on plant growth.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the primary}} (<b>growing)</b> <b>plant</b> cell wall, the major {{carbohydrates}} are cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin. The cellulose microfibrils are linked via hemicellulosic tethers {{to form the}} cellulose-hemicellulose network, which {{is embedded in the}} pectin matrix. The most common hemicellulose [...] in the primary cell wall is xyloglucan. In grass cell walls, xyloglucan and pectin are reduced in abundance and partially replaced by glucuronarabinoxylan, another type of hemicellulose. Primary cell walls characteristically extend (grow) by a mechanism called acid growth, which involves turgor-driven movement of the strong cellulose microfibrils within the weaker hemicellulose/pectin matrix, catalyzed by expansin proteins. The outer part of the primary cell wall of the plant epidermis is usually impregnated with cutin and wax, forming a permeability barrier known as the plant cuticle.|$|E

[...] If we conceive the anthracite cleared of all but its last atoms of oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, till it has become all but pure carbon, it would become--as it has become in certain rocks of immense antiquity, graphite--what we miscall black-lead. And, after that, it might go through one transformation more, and that the most startling of all. It would need only perfect purification and crystallisation to become--a diamond; nothing less. We may consider the coal upon the fire as the middle term of a series, of which the first is live wood, and the last diamond; and indulge safely in the fancy that every diamond {{in the world has}} probably, at some remote epoch, formed part of a <b>growing</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|E

They are not so sensitive as their cultivated kindred, but they still have the family disposition.|$|E

By degrees, the plant withers and disappears from view, leaving behind more or fewer apparently inert and simple bodies, just like the bean from which it sprang; and, like it, endowed with the potentiality of giving rise to a similar cycle of manifestations. Neither the poetic nor the scientific imagination is put to much strain in the search after analogies with this process of going forth and, as it were, returning to the starting-point. It may be likened to the ascent and descent of a slung stone, or {{the course of an}} arrow along its trajectory. Or we may say that the living energy takes first an upward and then a downward road. Or it may seem preferable to compare the expansion of the germ into the full-grown plant, to the unfolding of a fan, or to the rolling forth and widening of a stream; and thus to arrive at the conception of [...] "development," [...] or [...] "evolution." [...] Here, as elsewhere, names are [...] "noise and smoke"; the important point is to have a clear and adequate conception of the fact signified by a name. And, in this case, the fact is the Sisyphaean process, in the course of which, the living and <b>growing</b> <b>plant</b> passes from the relative simplicity and latent potentiality of the seed to the full epiphany of a highly differentiated type, thence to fall back to simplicity and potentiality.|$|E

60|$|But, {{although}} this general statement is complete and indisputable, {{yet to see}} its applications under all the complex conditions that actually occur in nature, it is necessary always {{to bear in mind}} the tremendous power and universality of the agencies at work. We must never for an instant {{lose sight of the fact}} of the enormously rapid increase of all organisms, which has been illustrated by actual cases, given in our second chapter, no less than by calculations of the results of unchecked increase for a few years. Then, never forgetting that the animal and plant population of any country is, on the whole, stationary, we must be always trying to realise the ever-recurring destruction of the enormous annual increase, and asking ourselves what determines, in each individual case, the death of the many, the survival of the few. We must think over all the causes of destruction to each organism,--to the seed, the young shoot, the <b>growing</b> <b>plant,</b> the full-grown tree, or shrub, or herb, and again the fruit and seed; and among animals, to the egg or new-born young, to the youthful, and to the adults. Then, we must always bear in mind that what goes on in the case of the individual or family group we may observe or think of, goes on also among the millions and scores of millions of individuals which are comprised in almost every species; and must get rid of the idea that chance determines which shall live and which die. For, although in many individual cases death may be due to chance rather than to any inferiority in those which die first, yet we cannot possibly believe that this can be the case on the large scale on which nature works. A plant, for instance, cannot be increased unless there are suitable vacant places its seeds can grow in, or stations where it can overcome other less vigorous and healthy plants. The seeds of all plants, by their varied modes of dispersal, may be said to be seeking out such places in which to grow; and we cannot doubt that, in the long run, those individuals whose seeds are the most numerous, have the greatest powers of dispersal, and the greatest vigour of growth, will leave more descendants than the individuals of the same species which are inferior in all these respects, although now and then some seed of an inferior individual may chance to be carried to a spot where it can grow and survive. The same rule will apply to every period of life and to every danger to which plants or animals are exposed. The best organised, or the most healthy, or the most active, or the best protected, or the most intelligent, will inevitably, in the long run, gain an advantage over those which are inferior in these qualities; that is, the fittest will survive, the fittest being, in each particular case, those which are superior in the special qualities on which safety depends. At one period of life, or to escape one kind of danger, concealment may be necessary; at another time, to escape another danger, swiftness; at another, intelligence or cunning; at another, the power to endure rain or cold or hunger; and those which possess all these faculties in the fullest perfection will generally survive.|$|E
