5|$|When I met him for {{the first}} time he was a few years younger than I am now, and I was barely on the edge of manhood. He drew me into a vortex of his endless campaigns and projects... He <b>introduced</b> <b>me</b> to Bach and Brahms, and to the {{importance}} of maintaining a balance in life between the pursuit of our individual pleasures and engagements in, and responsibility for, the social condition. He believed that no class, caste or genre of people were exempt from this obligation.|$|E

[...] "Richard Nixon <b>introduced</b> <b>me</b> to a man named Bill Safire, who's a New York Times columnist. He <b>introduced</b> <b>me</b> to a guy who's an {{executive}} at Warner Brothers. He <b>introduced</b> <b>me</b> to a guy who's a casting director. He <b>introduced</b> <b>me</b> to John Hughes. John Hughes and I are among the only Republicans in the picture business, and John Hughes {{put me in the}} movie", Stein said. Hughes said that Stein was an easy and early choice for the role of the teacher: [...] "He wasn't a professional actor. He had a flat voice, he looked like a teacher." ...|$|E

500|$|... "I {{think the}} movie is about mothers and sons," [...] Spacey said, {{referring}} to Darin's relationship with his mother Polly and sister Nina. Spacey's mother, Kathleen Fowler, died of brain cancer just before production started. [...] "I made the movie for all mothers, but especially for my mother. She <b>introduced</b> <b>me</b> to Bobby Darin. When she got very ill in 2002, I stopped everything {{and took care of}} her. We constantly played Bobby Darin records, and I'd let her listen to the tracks I was recording. I'm glad she passed knowing this was the movie I was going to make." [...] After his award-winning performances in The Usual Suspects and American Beauty, Spacey [...] "chose to move away from dark, sarcastic characters, and instead play damaged but good-hearted men" [...] in films like Pay It Forward, K-PAX and The Shipping News. The actor was criticized for his career move; Spacey acknowledged the similarities when Darin integrated into folk music and protest songs.|$|E
500|$|In 1954, Rothbard, {{along with}} several other {{attendees}} of Mises' seminar, joined the circle of novelist Ayn Rand, the founder of Objectivism. He soon parted from her, writing, among other things, that her ideas were not as original as she proclaimed but {{similar to those of}} Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas and Herbert Spencer. In 1958, after the publication of her novel, Atlas Shrugged, Rothbard wrote a [...] "fan letter" [...] to Rand, calling her book [...] "an infinite treasure house," [...] and [...] "not merely the greatest novel ever written, [...] one of the very greatest books ever written, fiction or nonfiction." [...] He also wrote that [...] "you <b>introduced</b> <b>me</b> to the whole field of natural rights and natural law philosophy," [...] prompting him to learn [...] "the glorious natural rights tradition." [...] He rejoined her circle for a few months, but soon broke with Rand once more, over various differences, including his defense of anarchism.|$|E
500|$|Among other {{contemporary}} rock musicians, Stephen Stills was {{so taken}} with the song that he had its lyrics carved on a stone monument in his yard. Lennon also admired the track, saying of Harrison: [...] "His mind and his music are clear. There is his innate talent, he brought that sound together." [...] David Crosby, who introduced Harrison to Shankar's music in 1965, described Harrison's fusion of ideas as [...] "utterly brilliant", adding: [...] "He did it beautifully and tastefully... He did it at absolutely the highest level that he could, and I was extremely proud of him for that." [...] Writing in the [...] "100 Rock Icons" [...] issue of Classic Rock, in 2006, singer Paul Rodgers cited the track to support Harrison's standing as what the magazine called [...] "the Beatles' musical medicine man". Rodgers said: [...] "He <b>introduced</b> <b>me</b> and a generation of people worldwide to {{the wisdom of the}} East. His thought-provoking 'Within You Without You' – with sitars, tablas and deep lyrics – was something completely different, even in a world full of unique music." ...|$|E

500|$|Usher's stage {{performances}} {{have been}} complimented by critics for being [...] "packed with high-octane choreography {{held together by}} sleek, masterful showmanship", and his engaging skill with audiences being [...] "enough {{to pull off a}} one-man show". His performances and dancing technique have often marked comparisons to his influences Michael Jackson and James Brown. He told People Magazine in 2008 that [...] "James Brown <b>introduced</b> <b>me</b> to soul. Because of him I was given a clear view of what a real performance is and should be. I learned showmanship from him." [...] On his 8701 Evolution Tour in 2002, Larry Nager of The Cincinnati Enquirer hailed Usher's simultaneous ability, stating [...] "the 23-year-old Atlantan proved you can sing and dance at the same time. Of course, that's how James Brown, Jackie Wilson and Usher's most obvious role model Michael Jackson did it, but in today's high-tech, gimmicky concerts, it's a lost art", and claims his show [...] "ended the reign of 'Nsync, Britney {{and the rest of the}} lip-synching, teen-pop acts". Usher performed singles [...] "Confessions Part II" [...] and [...] "Yeah!" [...] at 2004 MTV Video Music Awards under a rain machine, in which he eventually threw the mic stand at a mirror during the former. Rolling Stone placed it at number 13 of their [...] "20 Best MTV VMAs Opening Performances". Chad Batka for The New York Times said [...] "He has established himself as one of R's supreme performers and craftsmen, following through on what he learned from Michael Jackson in particular: songs that alternate between choppy and smooth, vocals punctuated by exultant high whoops, a dance vocabulary." [...] Capable of playing the piano, Usher also began to adopt playing on other instruments such as the drums and the bass guitar, amid singles [...] "Good Kisser" [...] and [...] "She Came to Give It to You" [...] in 2014. The UR Experience Tour was reported to have consisted of a nine-piece band and three backing vocalists according to Billboard, in which The Guardian called him [...] "a masterful all-rounder who surrounds himself with talent on stage". Maura Johnston of Rolling Stone labels him the [...] "Award Show King", explaining [...] "His dedication to choreography dates back to the days when Janet Jackson made videos that looked like they were shot in one take. He's an entertainer that would have been stunning at any point in the last 60 years of television." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following graduation, Matthews {{spent six}} years in Java, part of today's Indonesia, where he taught {{in one of the}} Chinese Nationalist schools {{established}} there {{after the fall of the}} Manchu dynasty in 1911. Matthews saw this experience as pivotal for his own intellectual development, writing in his memoirs: [...] My real education began in Java.

[...] She also recalls his {{influence}} on her while filming: [...] "He was really a gentleman, not at all like the things I had heard.

[...] On an emotional level, she said years later that [...] "he {{was one of the people}} in my life who cared, ... who took me seriously and gave me a lot of strength." [...] She told David Letterman more about her experience working with Polanski during an interview.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1969, {{the future}} wedding of Scott to oil {{executive}} William Dugger of San Antonio, Texas was announced {{after a two-year}} engagement.

[...] Dugger himself described Scott as [...] "A misunderstood soul searching for love. Her outward appearance is just a shell." [...] Dugger planned to make a film in Rome starring Scott, but he suddenly died on August 8, 1969. A handwritten codicil to his will leaving half his estate to his fiancée was contested by Dugger's sister, Sarah Dugger Schwartz. The will was judged invalid in 1971.|$|E
2500|$|Blackwell {{first became}} {{interested}} in music through the influence of her fourth grade teacher, Nancy Notargiacomo, who eventually became her voice and piano teacher when she was 10. She also credits her high school choral director for encouraging her to pursue a music career. In a 2003 interview Blackwell recalled, [...] "I {{did not come from}} a musical family. I had a fourth grade teacher that <b>introduced</b> <b>me</b> to music and I sang at the Catholic church. In high school I started doing musicals − The Sound of Music, Brigadoon, Oliver!, and so forth. I thought maybe this would be what I would pursue after high school, although even in my {{senior year in high school}} I had doubts. I wanted to go into history or fashion design. But, I had a wonderful choral director who said 'no, your calling is music,' and she convinced me." ...|$|E
