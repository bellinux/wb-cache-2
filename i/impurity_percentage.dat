To this purpose, we simulate {{the propagation of}} a relativistic Gaussian wavepacket through a graphene sample with randomly distributed potential barriers (impurities). The simulations, based on a relativistic quantum lattice Boltzmann method, permit to compute the transmission coefficient across the sample, thereby providing an estimate for the conductivity {{as a function of}} impurity concentration and strength of the potentials. It is found that the conductivity loss due to impurities is significantly higher for wave-packets of massive particles, as compared to massless ones. A general expression for the loss of conductivity {{as a function of the}} <b>impurity</b> <b>percentage</b> is presented and successfully compared with the Kozeny-Carman law for disordered media in classical fluid dynamics.

40|$|The {{interplay of}} {{magnetic}} energies in a Kondo lattice is the underlying physics {{of a heavy}} fermion system. Creating an artificial Kondo lattice system by localizing the moments in an ordered metallic array provides a prototype system to tune and study the energetic interplay while avoiding the complications introduced by random alloying of the material. In this article, we create a Kondo lattice system by fabricating a hexagonally ordered nanostructured array using niobium as the host metal and cobalt as the magnetic constituent. Electrical transport measurements and magnetoresistivity measurements of these artificial lattices show that the competing exchange coupling properties can be easily tuned by controlling the <b>impurity</b> <b>percentage.</b> These artificial Kondo lattice systems enable the exploration of an artificial superconductor which should lead to a deep {{understanding of the role}} of magnetism in unconventional superconductors.

40|$|Optical {{properties}} of pure and doped poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) films, prepared by using casting technique, with different nanosize zinc oxide (ZnO) concentrations (1 – 20) [*]wt% have been studied. Parameters such as extinction coefficient, refractive index, real and imaginary parts, Urbach energy, optical conductivity, infinitely high frequency dielectric constant, and average refractive index were studied {{by using the}} absorbance and transmittance measurement from computerized UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV- 1601 PC) in the spectral range 200 – 800 [*]nm. This study reveals that the optical {{properties of}} PVC {{are affected by the}} doping of ZnO where the absorption increases and transmission decreases as ZnO concentration increases. The extinction coefficient, refractive index, real and imaginary parts, infinitely high frequency dielectric constant, and average refractive index values were found to increase with increasing <b>impurity</b> <b>percentage.</b> The Urbach energy values are found to be decreasing with increasing ZnO concentration. The optical conductivity increased with photon energy after being doped and with the increase of ZnO concentration...|$|E

On {{using the}} classical proceeding for fabricating the ceramic for Electronic, we have prepared different samples with different oxide additives such as (Bi 2 O 3, Nb 2 O 5, MnO 2, Co 3 O 4, Cr 2 O 3, NiO, Ce 2 O 3, and La 2 O 3). We have got several lots, each of one represents one sample. We have optimized {{the percentage of}} the impurity as following: On varying the <b>impurity</b> <b>percentage,</b> we have obtain different values of the nonlinearity coefficient (α) for every sample. The greatest value of,α, corresponding to the best value of the proportion of the impurity which will be used in the final composition. Finally, we have mixed all best values together so we got a new sample, Our results explore that the value of (α) in the new sample is increased Significantly to a value of(100 ± 2) and the non-linear region of the I-V characteristic of the varistor was improved...|$|E
40|$|Pure and Antimony Trioxide Sb 2 O 3 doped PMMA {{films were}} {{prepared}} by the casting method. Optical absorption measurements in the wavelength range 200 - 800 nm were studied by using a computerized UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV- 1601 PC) and these confirmed that PMMA films have a direct band gap that decreases from 5. 15 to 4. 66 eV as the doping concentration increases to 5 wt%. The increase in the density of localized states from 8. 9 to 74. 5 meV causes an expansion in the Urbach tail and consequently decreases the energy gap. The dispersion of the refractive index was analyzed using {{the concept of a}} single oscillator. The values of the single oscillator energy were 32. 70, 13. 59, 7. 06, and 4. 58 eV, while the dispersion energy values were 4. 36, 49. 04, 21. 76 and 14. 15 eV for the pure, and 3 %, 4 % and 5 % Sb 2 O 3 for the doped PMMA films respectively. The single-term Sellmeier were determined, and the average oscillator position was investigated, the value of which decreased with increasing doping concentration. The value of average oscillator strength increased with increasing Sb 2 O 3 concentration to 5 wt%. Skin depth and optical conductivity could be calculated, and results show a decrease in Skin depth with an increasing <b>impurity</b> <b>percentage,</b> but an increase of optical conductivity with greater impurit...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{important}} aspect in CO 2 storage in geological media {{is the quality}} requirements put on the gases to be stored in terms of risk management. This study investigates and compares, through reactive transport modelling, the potential short-term (5 y) reactivity of CO 2 gas streams ˗ pure or containing ancillary gaseous compounds (SO 2 : 0 ˗ 1. 5 % Wt) ˗ with the reservoir-rock of a limestone aquifer at 75 °C. The modelling approach simulates the co-injection of CO 2 -(SO 2) gases, through injection of CO 2 (under supercritical form) and simultaneous injection of a SO 2 (as a dissolved species solution) rich brine with TOUGHREACT [1]. The numerical simulation results indicate {{the development of an}} acidification front (pH < 5) following the progression of the gas migration in the reservoir. After an injection period of 5 years, the acidified zone extends up to 500 m from the injection well, independently of the <b>impurity</b> <b>percentage</b> of the CO 2 gas stream. In close proximity of the injection well (0 - 10 m), substantial calcite dissolution, together with albite and K-feldspar dissolution, result in a drastic increase of the permeability (1 order of magnitude) and porosity (x 2). When CO 2 is injected alone, anhydrite also precipitates in this reservoir zone. Significant calcite dissolution is also predicted in the zone 50 - 100 m ˗ a highly reactive zone˗ resulting in a local permeability and porosity increase. Because of its high solubility, SO 2 mainly remains in the brine (SO 2 content lower in the CO 2 -rich phase than in the injected gas stream), decreasing its pH/Eh (relatively to pure CO 2). Dissolved SO 2 is lowly reactive with reservoir minerals...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the development of a three-dimensional computational model of water transport phenomena in the cathode catalyst layer (CCL) of PEMFCs. The catalyst layer in the numerical simulation was developed using the optimized sphere packing algorithm. The optimization technique named the adaptive random search technique (ARSET) was employed in this packing algorithm. The ARSET algorithm will generate the initial location of spheres and allow them to move in the random direction with the variable moving distance, randomly selected from the sampling range, based on the Lennard-jones potential of the current and new configuration. The solid fraction values obtained from this developed algorithm are in the range of 0. 631 to 0. 6384 while the actual processing time can significantly be reduced by 8 % to 36 % {{based on the number of}} spheres. The initial random number sampling range was investigated and the appropriate sampling range value is equal to 0. 5. This numerically developed cathode catalyst layer has been used to simulate the diffusion processes of protons, in the form of hydronium, and oxygen molecules through the cathode catalyst layer. The movements of hydroniums and oxygen molecules are controlled by the random vectors and all of these moves has to obey the Lennard-Jones potential energy constrain. Chemical reaction between these two species will happen when they share the same neighborhood and result in the creation of water molecules. Like hydroniums and oxygen molecules, these newly-formed water molecules also diffuse through the cathode catalyst layer. It is important to investigate and study the distribution of hydronium oxygen molecule and water molecules during the diffusion process in order to understand the lifetime of the cathode catalyst layer. The effect of fuel flow rate on the water distribution has also been studied by varying the hydronium and oxygen molecule input. Based on the results of these simulations, the hydronium: oxygen input ratio of 3 : 2 has been found to be the best choice for this study. To study the effect of metal impurity and gas contamination on the cathode catalyst layer, the cathode catalyst layer structure is modified by adding the metal impurities and the gas contamination is introduced with the oxygen input. In this study, gas contamination has very little effect on the electrochemical reaction inside the cathode catalyst layer because this simulation is transient in nature and the percentage of the gas contamination is small, in the range of 0. 0005 % to 0. 0015 % for CO and 0. 028 % to 0. 04 % for CO 2. Metal impurities seem to have more effect on the performance of PEMFC because they not only change the structure of the developed cathode catalyst layer but also affect the movement of fuel and water product. Aluminum has the worst effect on the cathode catalyst layer structure because it yields the lowest amount of newly form water and the largest amount of trapped water product compared to iron of the same <b>impurity</b> <b>percentage.</b> For the iron impurity, it shows some positive effect on the life time of the cathode catalyst layer. At the 0. 75 wt% of iron impurity, the amount of newly formed water is 6. 59 % lower than the pure carbon catalyst layer case but the amount of trapped water product is 11. 64 % lower than the pure catalyst layer. The lifetime of the impure cathode catalyst layer is longer than the pure one because the amount of water that is still trapped inside the pure cathode catalyst layer is higher than that of the impure one. Even though the impure cathode catalyst layer has a longer lifetime, it sacrifices the electrical power output because the electrochemical reaction occurrence inside the impure catalyst layer is lower...|$|E
