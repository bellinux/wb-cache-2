40|$|Vibration due to {{a bearing}} failure in a pump created {{significant}} vibrations in a <b>fifteen</b> <b>foot</b> by <b>fifteen</b> <b>foot</b> by eight feet tall mounting platform due to excitation of resonant frequencies. In this particular application, an 18, 000 pound pump was mounted to a structural steel platform. When bearing damage commenced, the platform vibrated with sufficient magnitude that conversations could not be heard within forty feet of the pump. Vibration analysis determined that {{the frequency of the}} bearing was coincident to one of the natural frequencies of the pump, which was, in turn, coincident to one of the natural frequencies of the mounting platform. This coincidence of frequencies defines resonance. Resonance creates excessive vibrations when the natural frequency of a structure is coincident to an excitation frequency. In this well documented case, the excitation frequency was related to ball bearing failures...|$|R

25|$|Knievel and his daredevils debuted on January 3, 1966, at the National Date Festival in Indio, California. The {{show was}} a huge success. Knievel {{received}} several offers to host the show after their first performance. The second booking was in Hemet, California, but was canceled due to rain. The next performance was on February 10, in Barstow, California. During the performance, Knievel attempted a new stunt {{in which he would}} jump, spread-eagled, over a speeding motorcycle. Knievel jumped too late and the motorcycle hit him in the groin, tossing him <b>fifteen</b> <b>feet</b> into the air. He was hospitalized {{as a result of his}} injuries. When released, he returned to Barstow to finish the performance he had started almost a month earlier.|$|E
25|$|The fort lies off the Mahim Causeway which {{links the}} suburbs to the city. The fort is heavily encroached by slums, {{and parts of}} the fort have caved in due to tidal erosion and neglect. Though the site is {{classified}} as a Grade I heritage structure, nothing much has been done to maintain it. Large boulders are strewn on the sand and crevices as high as three metres (<b>fifteen</b> <b>feet)</b> are visible. Responsibility of the fort is shuffled between the state government and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, although the fort lies of state government land. In 2004, rupees five lakhs had to be returned as the encroachments were not removed by local authorities. Later, in 2008, Jairaj Phatak, the Municipal Commissioner had proposed a makeover to the fort.|$|E
25|$|While {{on patrol}} in the Gulf of Thailand near the Cambodian border {{on the night}} of 19 September 1965 Point Marone intercepted a {{suspicious}} junk operating near Ha Tien and warned it to stop for boarding. After receiving fire from the junk she returned fire, and with assistance from Point Glover they sank the junk in <b>fifteen</b> <b>feet</b> of water. After the junk was recovered the following day, rifles, grenades, ammunition and documents were discovered. The only survivor of the crew of the junk provided intelligence which led to a raid on Hon Mot that was conducted on 26 September. Point Marone participated in the raid along with cutters Point Comfort and Point Grey by transporting civilian irregular defense group (CIDG) mercenaries and their Special Forces advisors to the raid and providing fire support with the 81mm mortar.|$|E

The false claims about his paralysis kept the guards unsuspecting, as he scaled a <b>fifteen</b> <b>foot</b> fence to escape the prison grounds. He waited in a nearby wooded area, remaining concealed in the brush and leaves until the search widened and he could continue running. However, Garrow was spotted by guards {{a few days later}} a few hundred yards away from the prison walls. Garrow shot at his pursuers, but was killed when they returned fire.|$|R
50|$|Several {{extensions}} and {{additions to}} the school were added over the years, including a <b>fifteen</b> <b>foot</b> extension in July 1900 (possibly the extension to the north-east side of the building); other additions in January 1901; repairs in July 1911; commencement of the planting of gardens in April 1917 and new school buildings in 1918. In June 1930, tenders were called for the purchase and removal of the teacher's residence. By July 1929, tenders were invited {{for the construction of}} {{additions to the}} school, following which, an eastern wing, with two classrooms was opened.|$|R

25|$|Andrianjafy became bolder {{and decided}} to send a group of assassins to Ramboasalama's {{residence}} in Ambohimanga; confident of his plan, he showed the funeral goods he had prepared for Ramboasalama to his brother, and then departed his stronghold at Ambohimanga for a circumcision ceremony {{to be held at}} Ilafy. Andriantsimitovizainitrimo promptly sent a messenger to his nephew instructing him to flee. Rather than leave Ambohimanga, Ramboasalama followed the advice of an elder who instructed him to sacrifice a ram to invoke ancestral protection. The elder then gathered the twelve most respected men of Ambohimanga and thirty soldiers, and rallied them to enforce the decree of Andriambelomasina by overthrowing Andrianjafy and swearing allegiance to Ramboasalama, who took the throne name Andrianampoinimerina. The support of the Tsimahafotsy, inhabitants of Ambohimanga, ensured the defense of the city against efforts by Andrianjafy to reclaim his capital and his authority. Enraged, Andrianjafy took revenge against his brother Andriantsimitovizainitrimo, whom he murdered by pulling him from his bed, which was raised in the traditional style over <b>fifteen</b> <b>feet</b> above the ground.|$|E
25|$|On March 3, 1847, Rodman was {{promoted}} to first lieutenant, and {{was promoted}} {{to the rank of}} captain on July 1, 1855. Rodman experimented for almost a decade at the Fort Pitt Foundry in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, testing his theory and performing trial runs of his cannon barrels. After viewing the results, the U.S. War Department approved construction of a fifteen-inch smoothbore columbiad of Rodman's design in 1859. On December 23 a prototype was cast, and it test fired 509 times without incident. The following year he supervised its construction at the foundry, and once complete it was shipped for testing to Fortress Monroe at Old Point Comfort on the Virginia Peninsula. It tested successfully there in March 1861, but due to its size and weight it would be destined for permanent, fixed positions, and not suitable for field service nor naval use. The specifications of this gun were: overall length of <b>fifteen</b> <b>feet,</b> ten inches long; and a bore length of thirteen feet, nine inches; total weight around 50,000 pounds. This design, capable of firing either shell or shot, would be the base for most of the Rodman guns that followed.|$|E
25|$|On December 7, 1906, the Board of Estimate {{recommended}} that two bids be let: {{one for the}} construction of the line, and one for the construction, equipment, and operation of the line. A spur to Coney Island was added to the plan after the persistency of Frank Hudson. On May 31, 1907, the Rapid Transit Commission requested that the Board of Estimate rescind the above resolution so that bids of construction alone might be asked for, and it authorized the preparation of the plans and contracts. On June 4, 1907, a resolution was passed by the Board of Estimate that authorized the Rapid Transit Commission that rescinded the resolution and authorized the Rapid Transit Commission to let out bids of construction only. On June 27, 1907, the Rapid Transit Commission approved the plans and contracts {{with the exception of the}} section between Ashland Place and Fulton Street to Sackett Street and Fourth Avenue. The Rapid Transit Commission was succeeded by the Public Service Commission (PSC) on July 1, 1907, and the new commission hesitated to approve the plan for the line. People in South Brooklyn were angered by the delay, and 3,000 people from the area showed up to a meeting on September 11, 1907, urging the PSC to act. In October and November 1907, the PSC approved the plans and contracts with modifications concerning grades and an increase in the height of the subway to <b>fifteen</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then {{for an hour}} we raced over true prairie, great yellow-green plains crossed by old buffalo trails, {{which do}} not improve motor springs, till a single chimney broke the horizon like a mast at sea; and thereby were more light-hearted men and women, a shed and a tent or two for workmen, the ribs and frames of the brick-making mechanism, a <b>fifteen</b> <b>foot</b> square shaft sunk, sixty foot down to the clay, and, stark and black, the pipe of a natural-gas well.

5000|$|In Behind the Urals Scott recalls many {{examples}} of the danger workers faced in Magnitogorsk: [...] I {{was just going to}} start welding when I heard someone sing out, and something swished down past me. It was a rigger who had been working on the very top. He bounced off the bleeder pipe, which probably saved his life. Instead of falling {{all the way to the}} ground, he landed on the main platform about <b>fifteen</b> <b>foot</b> below me. By the time I got down to him, blood was coming out of his mouth in gushes. He tried to yell, but could not.|$|R
50|$|The {{main floor}} {{originally}} had reception rooms with <b>fifteen</b> <b>foot</b> ceilings richly ornamented with boiseries and moldings. The dwelling’s only master bedroom {{was also on}} this level. A very steep little staircase located {{in one of the}} halls gave access to a lower level where service areas such as the kitchen and laundry room had ceilings scarcely 7 feet high. All these lower rooms were provided with very tiny windows opening onto the garden.This architecture remained virtually unchanged until the 1980s. The modifications to the structure made by its various occupants were confined to interior decoration and redesign of the park until that date.|$|R
25|$|Vercingetorix {{sent the}} cavalry around Gaul {{to call the}} Gallic tribes to war and come to Alesia. When Caesar heard of this from deserters and captives, he dug a trench twenty feet deep (6 metres, 19ft.) with {{perpendicular}} sides, built all other works four hundred feet (118 m, 388ft.) away from that trench and in between he dug two trenches <b>fifteen</b> <b>feet</b> (4.4 m,14.5ft.) in length and depth. The inner one was filled with water from the rivers. Behind them he built a twelve feet high (3.5 m, 11.6ft.) rampart and wall with a parapet and large stakes projecting from the joint between the parapet and the battlement to prevent the enemy from scaling it. This was surrounded with turrets eighty feet apart (23.7 m, 77.7ft.). The stakes for the palisade were sharpened to a point, sunk into a five-feet deep trench (1.5m, 4.85ft.), fastened at the bottom {{so that they could}} not be pulled up, and placed in five intersected rows. Eight rows, three feet apart (0.89 m, 2.9ft.), of conic pits which were three feet deep were dug in oblique rows {{in the form of a}} quincunx (an arrangement of five objects with four at the corners the fifth at the centre) in front of the palisade.They were called 'cippi.' Stakes sharpened at the top and hardened with fire, the thickness of a man’s thigh, were sunk in the pits and protruded four inches (0.1 m, 3.9 inches) from the ground. The pits were filled with clay and covered over with twigs. One-foot-long stakes (0.3 m) with iron hooks were sunk at small intervals in front of the pits. To prepare for the arrival of the Gallic relief forces he constructed an outer fortification, a contravallation, with the same specifications as protection against external attack by the Gallic relief force. The besiegers were preparing to be besieged.|$|E
25|$|Asian {{black bears}} are diurnal, though they become nocturnal near human habitations. They may live in family groups {{consisting}} of two adults and two successive litters of young. They will walk in a procession of largest to smallest. They are good climbers of rocks and trees, and will climb to feed, rest, sun, elude enemies and hibernate. Some older bears may become too heavy to climb. Half of their life is spent in trees and {{they are one of}} the largest arboreal mammals. In the Ussuri territory, black bears can spend up to 15% of their time in trees. Asian black bears break branches and twigs to place under themselves when feeding on trees, thus causing many trees in their home ranges to have nest-like structures on their tops. Asian black bears will rest for short periods in nests on trees standing <b>fifteen</b> <b>feet</b> or higher. Asian black bears do not hibernate over most of their range. They may hibernate in their colder, northern ranges, though some bears will simply move to lower elevations. Nearly all pregnant sows hibernate. Black bears prepare their dens for hibernation in mid-October, and will sleep from November until March. Their dens can either be dug out hollow trees (sixty feet above ground), caves or holes in the ground, hollow logs, or steep, mountainous and sunny slopes. They may also den in abandoned brown bear dens. Asiatic black bears tend to den at lower elevations and on less steep slopes than brown bears. Female black bears emerge from dens later than do males, and female black bears with cubs emerge later than barren females. Asian black bears tend to be less mobile than brown bears. With sufficient food, Asian black bears can remain in an area of roughly 1–2sqkm, and sometimes even as little as 0.5–1sqkm.|$|E
25|$|While Middlebury College {{certainly}} {{began the}} sporting craze for quidditch, an independent {{form of the}} sport originated {{in the early spring}} of 2007 {{on the campus of the}} University of North Georgia in Dahlonega, Georgia. This version of the sport uses a Flying Disk as its quaffle, dodge balls as bludgers, and a golden-yellow 'super ball' for the snitch. This form of the game (known affectionately as 'Corrigan Quidditch' after its originator, an English professor at the university who taught a Harry Potter class that term and developed the game for tournament play as an outgrowth of that course) does not call for players to hold a broom between the legs. Additionally, all of the playing apparatus is located within the playing pitch (quaffle, bludgers, snitch, beater's bats, and keeper's brooms). The two brooms are used only to defend the goals, which rise five, ten, and <b>fifteen</b> <b>feet</b> above the pitch at each end of an elongated octagonal playing field approximately 200 feet long. 'Corrigan Quidditch', as does the Middlebury version, has its own official rule book but features whimsical offenses including a 'Queensbury' (moving both feet whilst holding the quaffle) and an 'Impermissible' (which allows the offended chaser to run with the quaffle (without incurring a Queensbury offense) and make a 'try' at the goals, defended only by the opposing keeper). Play includes non-participating teams who stand around the pitch and take control of both 'bludgering' players as well as 'sending off' the snitch at irregular intervals during play to allow the seekers (who are kept secret during play) to attempt a game-winning catch. 'Corrigan Quidditch' was the form of play originally covered in the world press during that significant summer when the seventh Harry Potter book (and fifth Harry Potter movie) was released. Unlike the world-popular Middlebury version, 'Corrigan Quidditch' remains a local event still played on its originating campus.|$|E
