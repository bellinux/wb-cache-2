Between 1901 and 1904, they were arrested three times, including in January 1902, their Christchurch office was raided by Police, with the case going to court the following month. The case went to a jury trial, but all the witnesses refused to give evidence, {{as they would have}} incriminated themselves by doing so, as it was illegal to visit a <b>gaming</b> <b>house.</b> Without any witness statements, the jury delivered a not guilty verdict. For a 1906 raid of the Christchurch office, the Police had previously sent an undercover agent to the office to place a bet in order to have some evidence for a court case.|$|E

60|$|DEAR THOMPSON: A tirade {{is still}} kept up against me here for recommending T. R. King. This morning it is openly avowed that my {{supposed}} influence at Washington shall {{be broken down}} generally, and King's prospects defeated in particular. Now, what I have done in this matter I have done {{at the request of}} you and some other friends in Tazewell; and I therefore ask you to either admit it is wrong or come forward and sustain me. If the truth will permit, I propose that you sustain me in the following manner: copy the inclosed scrap in your own handwriting and get everybody (not three or four, but three or four hundred) to sign it, and then send it to me. Also, have six, eight or ten of our best known Whig friends there write to me individual letters, stating the truth in this matter as they understand it. Don't neglect or delay in the matter. I understand information of an indictment having been found against him about three years ago, for gaming or keeping a <b>gaming</b> <b>house,</b> has been sent to the department.

50|$|The actual {{penalties}} imposed for hosting or {{participating in}} illegal poker vary widely, and appear to depend greatly on the sensibilities of the presiding judge(s). For example, in 2011 a Winnipeg man (on appeal) won a conditional discharge despite having pleaded guilty to the more serious charge of keeping a common <b>gaming</b> <b>house,</b> meaning {{he did not get}} a criminal record. For the less serious charge of being in a common <b>gaming</b> <b>house,</b> discharges (including absolute discharges) are not uncommon, especially if the accused has no prior criminal record. But this is not always the case, for example in 2012 several Sudbury men were fined for the less serious charge of being in a common <b>gaming</b> <b>house,</b> meaning they did get criminal records. Among those fined in that case was at least one man whom the presiding judge acknowledged had not even been playing. Therefore, anyone charged even with the less serious offence of being in a common <b>gaming</b> <b>house</b> with respect to a poker game would be well advised to seek counsel prior to entering a plea on the charge.|$|E
