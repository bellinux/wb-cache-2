25|$|Measuring exergy {{requires}} {{the evaluation of}} a system’s reference state environment. With respect to the applications of exergy on natural resource utilization, the process of quantifying a system {{requires the}} assignment of value (both utilized and potential) to resources that are not always easily dissected into typical cost-benefit terms. However, to fully realize the potential of a system to do work, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>increasingly</b> imperative to understand exergetic potential of natural resources, and how human interference alters this potential.|$|E
25|$|Today, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>increasingly</b> popular {{to analyze}} the {{environmental}} impacts of natural resource utilization, especially for energy usage. To understand the ramifications of these practices, exergy is utilized as a tool for determining the impact potential of emissions, fuels, and other sources of energy. Combustion of fossil fuels, for example, is examined with respect to assessing {{the environmental impacts of}} burning coal, oil, and natural gas. The current methods for analyzing the emissions from these three products can be compared to the process of determining the exergy of the systems affected; specifically, it is useful to examine these with regard to the reference state environment of gases within the atmosphere. In this way, it is easier to determine how human action is affecting the natural environment.|$|E

25|$|While the {{majority}} of Dawoodi Bohras have traditionally been traders, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>increasingly</b> common for them to become professionals. Some choose to become Doctors, consultants or analysts {{as well as a}} large contingent of medical professionals. Dawoodi Bohras are encouraged to educate themselves in both religious and secular knowledge, and as a result, the number of professionals in the community is rapidly increasing. Dawoodi Bohras believe that the education of women is equally important as that of men, and many Dawoodi Bohra women choose to enter the workforce. Al Jamea tus Saifiyah (The Arabic Academy) in Surat, Nairobi and Karachi is a sign to the educational importance in the Dawoodi community. The Academy has an advanced curriculum which encompasses religious and secular education for both men and women.|$|E
25|$|That project {{endeavors to}} present all the {{phenomena}} in society that are perceived negatively by groups transcending national frontiers. Those phenomena constitute {{a challenge to}} creative remedial action. Groups are strongly motivated by the problems that infringe their values and arouse their indignation. As such, problems are a major stimulus driving the development of society. Although there is agreement that problems are numerous and that many are really serious, little effort {{has been made to}} determine how many problems there are. Likewise, while <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>increasingly</b> evident that problems interact with one another, and constitute complex networks or systems, little effort has been made to map that complexity. The perceptions documented in that project raise useful questions concerning the nature and existence of problems, especially when other groups consider that one perception or another is irrelevant, misleading or misinformed. An aim of that research area, then, is to assemble information whose significance is collectively repressed, displaced onto some less threatening problems, or projected in the form of blame onto some other social group.|$|E
25|$|The Court's assumptions, some say, {{have made}} the Mackay Radio ruling {{theoretically}} unsupportable {{as a matter of}} equity. Because the Court assumed that employers must hire permanent replacements as a matter of business necessity, the Court did not find it necessary to require the employer to show the need for permanent replacements. This places the burden on either the Board or unions to prove that the employer had an anti-union animus. But the Supreme Court subsequently held that replacement workers cannot be presumed to be anti-union, so their use is not enough to show animus. Indeed, courts have been reluctant to find support for anti-union animus in any except the most extreme cases. As legal scholars point out, under Mackay Radio, employers can now cloak anti-union animus under the guise of using permanent replacements. They note that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>increasingly</b> common for employers to deunionize using permanent replacements, and nearly impossible for unions to obtain legal redress. This has held to a radical shift in American labor policy which Congress did not intend.|$|E

25|$|The {{seriousness}} of the spring equinox drift is widely discounted {{on the grounds that}} Passover will remain in the spring season for many millennia, and the text of the Torah is generally not interpreted as having specified tight calendrical limits. Of course, the Hebrew calendar also drifts with respect to the autumn equinox, and {{at least part of the}} harvest festival of Sukkot is already more than a month after the equinox in years 1, 9, and 12 of each 19-year cycle; beginning in AM 5818 (2057 CE), this will also be the case in year 4. (These are the same year numbers as were mentioned for the spring season in the previous paragraph, except that they get incremented at Rosh Hashanah.) This progressively increases the probability that Sukkot will be cold and wet, making it uncomfortable or impractical to dwell in the traditional succah during Sukkot. The first winter seasonal prayer for rain is not recited until Shemini Atzeret, after the end of Sukkot, yet <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>increasingly</b> likely that the rainy season in Israel will start before the end of Sukkot.|$|E
25|$|Some {{other states}} were also divided into land {{divisions}} and land districts; {{in the nineteenth}} century land districts sometimes served as the region name for parts of the state where counties had not been proclaimed yet. Below these are groups of land parcels known as deposited plans, registered plans or title plans (depending on the state). Queensland has registered plans; New South Wales and Western Australia have deposited plans; while Victoria has certified plans. Land can be identified using the number of this plan of subdivision held with the lands department, rather than with a named unit such as a parish (or both can be used); <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>increasingly</b> common to use only the plan number. Within these are individual land parcels such as lots; in total there are estimated to be about 10.2 million of these in Australia. The various cadastral units appear on certificates of title, which are given volume and folio numbers; these numbers by themselves are sometimes used to identify land parcels, or in combination with the other units. Detailed maps of these divisions have been required since the introduction of the Torrens title system of a central register of land holdings in South Australia in 1858, which spread to the other colonies. While cadastral data since the 1980s has been digitalised, there remain many old maps showing these divisions held in collections of Australian libraries such as the National Library of Australia, as well as in state libraries.|$|E

2500|$|Nearly {{every person}} who {{undergoes}} a vitrectomy—without ever having had cataract surgery—will experience progression of nuclear sclerosis after the operation. This may be because the native vitreous humor is different to the solutions used to replace the vitreous (vitreous substitutes), such as BSS Plus. This may also be because the native vitreous humour contains ascorbic acid which helps neutralize oxidative damage to the lens and because traditional vitreous substitutes do not contain ascorbic acid. [...] As such, for phakic patients requiring a vitrectomy <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>increasingly</b> common for ophthalmologists to offer the vitrectomy with a combined prophylactic cataract surgery procedure to prophylactically prevent cataract formation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first player}} {{to capture a}} stone wins. It was invented by Japanese {{professional}} Yasutoshi Yasuda, who describes it in his book Go As Communication.

He sees it as a game in its own right, not just as a prelude to Go, but also as a way to introduce simple concepts that lead to Go. For the latter purpose, he recommends progressing to [...] "Most Capture", in which the player capturing the most stones wins. This variation is often called Atari Go in the West, where <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>increasingly</b> popular as a preliminary means of introducing Go itself to beginners, since, afterward, it is natural to introduce the idea of capturing territory, not just the opponent's stones.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{children}} {{no longer}} wear diapers when past {{two to four}} years of age, depending on culture, diaper type, parental habits, and the child's personality. [...] However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>increasingly</b> common for children as old as five to still be wearing diapers because of their parents' neglect or the child's opposition to toilet training. [...] This can pose a number of problems if the child is sent to school wearing diapers, including teasing from classmates and health issues resulting from soiled diapers. [...] Teachers' groups—who are attributing the epidemic to an increase in full-time day care use—are requesting that diapered children be banned from the classroom. [...] The disposable diaper industry has been accused of encouraging this trend by manufacturing diapers in increasingly larger sizes. [...] "uper-comfortable diapers" [...] have also been criticized; the advanced technology in modern diapers wick wetness away from skin, leaving the child oblivious to their accident and when they {{need to go to the}} toilet.
