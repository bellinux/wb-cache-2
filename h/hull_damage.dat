5|$|Hurricane Gustav {{initially}} posed {{a significant}} {{threat to the}} Lesser Antilles which had already suffered severe damages from Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Several watches and warnings were issued for the islands between August26 and 27; however, due to the northward turn, Gustav did not directly impact the region. Only light rain and large swells were reported. Offshore, a ship encountered the storm and sustained <b>hull</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the ship}} began on 17 June 1863 at the Carr and MacPherson Shipyard in Saint Petersburg. Latnik was laid down on 24 December 1863 and she was {{launched}} on 22 March 1864. She entered service on 14 July 1865 and cost a total of 1,148,000 rubles, almost double her contract cost of 600,000 rubles. The ship {{was assigned to the}} Baltic Fleet upon completion. For some reason, she was the only ship of the class not to make a port visit to Stockholm, Sweden in July–August 1865. She suffered some sort of <b>hull</b> <b>damage</b> in September, but the details are not known.|$|E
5|$|The player flies {{around in}} a fighter with a first-person, in-cockpit view with a fully {{customizable}} fixed head-up display (HUD) as the visual interface. The HUD displays video communications and relevant data on the ship's status and performance, weapons, objectives, and targets. It can also warn players from which direction missiles are locking onto them from, thus becoming an aide for launching countermeasures or taking evasive maneuvers. Players have to maneuver into position and shoot through both shields and hull to destroy enemy ships. While <b>hull</b> <b>damage</b> is unrecoverable, shields recharge over time. With the game supporting force feedback technology, joystick players will find their controllers vibrating or putting up resistance when they engage the afterburners or collide with objects. Similarly, certain events, such as engaging afterburners and firing powerful weapons, will shake the screen {{as a form of}} visual feedback.|$|E

5|$|In August, she steamed to New York for repairs, {{arriving}} at Base 10 on 19 August and entering the New York Navy Yard soon thereafter. She completed repairs on 26 September and got underway for Port Jefferson that same day. During the mid-watch on 27 September, she ran hard aground on Block Island. Captain Victor Blue and his navigator, confused about shore lights and {{more concerned about}} the minefield at the opening of Long Island Sound, made the turn at the wrong time and ran the ship aground on the island from the bow all the way aft beyond midships. For three days, her crew lightened ship to no avail. On 30 September, tugs came to her assistance, and she finally backed clear. <b>Hull</b> <b>damage</b> dictated a return to the yard, and extensive repairs precluded her departure with Battleship Division 9 (BatDiv 9) for the British Isles in November. The secondary battery was reduced to eighteen 5-inch guns in October 1917. Captain Blue, a protege of Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels, was never court-martialed and remained in command of Texas. The Navy Department held his navigator entirely responsible for the accident.|$|E
25|$|Shields are rechargeable; {{they protect}} from damage but are {{depleted}} when absorbing damage. When the player's craft is unshielded, enemy fire will damage the player's hull. <b>Hull</b> <b>damage</b> can disable systems, {{such as the}} engines or targeting computer. Disabled systems will slowly be repaired; TIE Fighter allows the player to choose {{the order in which}} systems are repaired. <b>Hull</b> <b>damage</b> may also cause cockpit displays to break, rendering them useless {{for the remainder of the}} mission. Heavy <b>hull</b> <b>damage</b> will destroy the player's spacecraft. When the player's craft is destroyed before completing a mission, or the mission is otherwise a failure, the player can attempt the mission again. However, the mission is still successful if the player's craft is destroyed after all primary mission objectives are completed.|$|E
25|$|On 15 December 2008, {{the ship}} was {{involved}} in the rescue of Bernard Stamm, whose IMOCA Open 60 racing yacht Cheminées Poujoulat ran aground and sustained significant <b>hull</b> <b>damage</b> near the Kerguelen Islands during the 2008-2009 edition of the Vendée Globe round the world, single hand yacht race.|$|E

25|$|After many delays due to {{difficulties}} with her machinery contractors, HMS Venerable commissioned on 12 November 1902 for service as Second Flagship, Rear Admiral, Mediterranean Fleet. During her Mediterranean service, she ran aground outside Algiers harbor, suffering slight <b>hull</b> <b>damage,</b> and underwent a refit at Malta in 1906–1907. On 12 August 1907 {{she was relieved}} as flagship by battleship HMS Prince of Wales, and her Mediterranean service ended on 6 January 1908, when she paid off at Chatham Dockyard.|$|E
25|$|On 9 October 1931, Tenryū was {{assigned}} to patrols of the Yangtze River in China {{as part of the}} IJN 3rd Fleet, and was thus in combat during the January 28 Incident at Shanghai in 1932. She returned to Japan in October 1933, and from November 1934 was again based at Kure. On 26 September 1935, during fleet maneuvers in a typhoon, Tatsuta (along with several other vessels) suffered <b>hull</b> <b>damage</b> in what later {{came to be known as}} the Fourth Fleet Incident. Repair work at Kure Naval Arsenal lasted until May 1936.|$|E
25|$|In late 1972, Radio Caroline {{had money}} problems. On 28 December, unpaid crew cut the Mi Amigos {{generator}} fuel line and departed. Later that day, the Dutch Royal Navy returned {{the crew and}} fighting broke out on board. Two days later, Mi Amigo was towed to IJmuiden and seized because of unpaid bills. Because of the Christmas holidays, no solicitors were available to issue a writ and the ship lay in Amsterdam harbour until O'Rahilly arranged {{for it to be}} towed back to sea. The ship was further delayed by <b>hull</b> <b>damage</b> and repaired before writs could be issued.|$|E

25|$|And third, each {{ship has}} {{a display of}} systems (a Ship Systems Display, or SSD) {{that acts as a}} {{schematic}} diagram of a particular ship in play. Each class in the game has an individualized SSD, and most expansions revolve around providing new classes and 'variants' of ships to the game, with new SSDs. These displays consist of check-off boxes for all the ship's structure and systems (shields in all six directions, systems and <b>hull</b> <b>damage,</b> how much power the engines produce, how many transporters there are, etc. checked off when damaged) in the general layout of the ship, along with general reference information for that ship (tracks to check off use for weapons in limited supply like drones, shuttles, probes, plus weapons fire resolution tables, firing arcs, and miscellaneous ship data).|$|E
25|$|In combat, {{the player}} can manage the ship's systems by distributing power, order crew to {{specific}} stations or rooms to repair damage, and fire weapons at the enemy ship. Successful weapon strikes by either side can damage systems, disabling their functions until repaired by crew; cause hull breaches that vent air into space until patched by crew; ignite fires that spread and damage both {{systems and the}} hull until they are extinguished by crew or starved of oxygen; and inflict direct <b>hull</b> <b>damage,</b> which reduces the ship's hull points. A ship is destroyed once its hull points are reduced to zero, or defeated once its crew is eliminated. A player victory earns resources for bartering, upgrading, or combat; an enemy victory results in game failure, deleting the save file and forcing the player to start over, creating {{a high level of}} difficulty. Alternatively, the player may evade combat by jumping to another waypoint after the ship's engines have fully charged.|$|E
25|$|Returning to Leyte Gulf, Saufley {{lost one}} man and {{suffered}} considerable <b>hull</b> <b>damage</b> in an engagement with enemy planes on 29 November. Following repairs at the Admiralties, she proceeded to a 2 January 1945 rendezvous with the Lingayen attack force. Moving into the Sulu Sea on the 7th, Saufley shot down an attacking Japanese aircraft at dusk on the 8th. On the morning of 9 January, the formation stood into Lingayen Gulf. Saufley provided screening services as the assault waves landed in the Lingayen area. On the morning of 10 January, Saufley splashed another aircraft, this time a Val attempting to crash the destroyer. Saufley got underway on 12 January to return to Leyte Gulf. From Leyte Gulf, she escorted a convoy to Morotai and returned on 26 January. Sailing for Luzon, Saufley arrived off Nasugbu to support the landing there on 31 January. On 1 February, she sank an attacking Japanese boat. She then commenced call fire support which continued for four days. Saufley then set a course for Subic Bay.|$|E

5000|$|On 27 March 1944, Medusa {{departed}} Efate for {{a series}} of shorter assignments. First sailing to New Guinea, she repaired ships of the 7th Fleet at Milne Bay and Buna Roads; she then steamed to Guadalcanal, where she arrived on 15 May 1944 for service with the 3rd Fleet. On 1 June 1944, she steamed to Sydney, Australia, for repairs to her <b>hull,</b> <b>damaged</b> by grounding on Buna Shoal in May, before continuing on to Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands. After the ammunition ship [...] disintegrated in a massive explosion at Manus on 10 November 1944, she provided repairs and medical supplies to internal combustion engine repair ship , which had suffered heavy damage in the explosion.|$|R
25|$|In August 1901, Zephyr was {{commissioned}} at Devonport by {{the officers and}} crew of the destroyer , whose place she took as instructional tender to Cambridge, gunnery school ship, and {{took part in the}} 1901 Naval Manoeuvres. Although contemporary reports suggested that Zephyr and her sister would be allocated to the Australian station, the two ships served their whole career in British waters. Zephyr served in the Portsmouth instructional flotilla until she was paid off at Portsmouth in April 1902, and docked to be strengthened, after she and her sister suffered <b>hull</b> <b>damage</b> below the waterline while being driven into a head sea in heavy weather in the English Channel. Lieutenant George Norman Ballard was appointed in command on 21 June 1902, and she took part in the fleet review held at Spithead on 16 August 1902 for the coronation of King Edward VII. Two years later, on 18 August 1904 Zephyr was rammed by Torpedo Boat No. 68 in Portsmouth Harbour and holed below the waterline by the torpedo boat's ram, flooding Zephyrs engine room. The torpedo boat was undamaged.Zephyr was involved in another collision on 4 February 1908 when she struck the Cricket-class coastal destroyer TB 2 in Portsmouth harbour, holing TB 2 s hull and forcing her to be docked for repair.|$|E
25|$|Plans {{to form an}} expeditionary {{were started}} {{immediately}} after the January 1840 vote. Several infantry regiments were raised in the British isles, and the completion of ships already under construction was expedited. To conduct the upcoming war, Britain also began to draw on forces from its overseas Empire. British India had been preparing for a war since word had arrived that the opium had been destroyed, and several regiments of Bengali volunteers had been recruited to supplement the regular British Indian Army and East India Company forces. In terms of naval forces, the ships earmarked for the expedition were either posted in remote colonies or under repair, and Oriental Crisis of 1840 (and the resulting risk of war between Britain, France, and the Ottoman Empire over Syria) drew {{the attention of the}} Royal Navy's European fleets away from China. Orders where dispatched to British South Africa and Australia to send ships to Singapore, the assigned rendezvous point for the expedition. A number of steamers were purchased by the Royal Navy and attached to the expedition as transports. The unseasonable summer weather of India and the Strait of Malacca slowed the British deployment, and a number of accidents decreased the combat readiness of the expedition. Most notably, both of the 74-gun ships of the line that the Royal Navy intended to use against Chinese fortifications were temporarily put out of action by <b>hull</b> <b>damage.</b> Despite delays, by mid-June 1840 British forces had begun to assemble in Singapore. While they waited for more ships to arrive, the Royal Marines practiced amphibious invasions on the beach, first by landing ashore in boats, then forming lines and advancing on mock fortifications.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} {{of the game is}} spent sailing from destination to destination around the Caribbean islands. To control their ship the player must use the number pad (or the directional arrows) on the keyboard. Mouse navigation is also possible, where clicking anywhere on the screen will send the ship sailing in that direction. During the sailing segment, the player navigates between areas of interest in the Caribbean, including colonies, cities, missions, pirate havens, and others. Wind conditions have an important effect on sailing, as winds tend to blow westwards (especially on lower difficulty levels) and as such speed up travels to the west while slowing down travel to the east. Clouds passing overhead indicate barometric depressions, and at the centers of these depressions are storms which cause powerful winds, usually assisting sailing in any direction but also posing a threat to any ship passing underneath the storm. Unlike previous versions of the game, the Caribbean is teeming with ships represented visually by their three-dimensional models. The player can spot these ships from a distance and even collect information about their mission, port of departure, destination, and nationality. This allows the player to hand-pick his targets, as well as actively pursue most ships if an attack is to be attempted. Unlike previous Pirates! games, however, enemy ships cannot force the player to fight, although they can bombard the player's ships en route to a destination and even sink some (but not all) of the player's ships if they bombard them long enough. Fortified cities which hold a particular grudge against the player (or whose controlling nation holds a substantial bounty over the player's head) may also open fire upon the player's fleet as it passes by. The player must also navigate around reefs and shoals, which cause <b>hull</b> <b>damage</b> to any ship which passes over them (but rarely sink ships, unlike in previous versions). Finally, if the player wishes, he may sail the ship onto the shoreline, allowing the crew to disembark and begin to march. This can be used when the player wishes to approach a hostile city without being fired upon, to attack a friendly city, or to travel on land seeking buried treasure, lost cities, or Montalban's hideout.|$|E
5000|$|The tanker {{remained}} on the Guam-Ulithi [...] "express" [...] water supply run through January 1945. On 7 February, while she was steaming toward Guam, orders rerouted Tombigbee to Saipan. Subsequently removed to Tinian with a full load of water, she supplied water until 19 February, when she joined Task Group (TG) 50.9 and got underway for the Volcano Islands. At 09:24 six days later, Tombigbee was detached from the task group and entered the harbor at Iwo Jima. There, the water carrier lay-to and {{kept out of the}} line of fire of the supporting battleships, cruisers, and destroyers. Rough seas hampered her water-discharging operations, but the need for fresh water overrode considerations, such as the desire to avoid minor <b>hull</b> <b>damages</b> caused by the ships bumping and scraping each other in the tossing waves.|$|R

500|$|She {{was raised}} the {{following}} month and thereafter transferred to the United States Navy as a war prize. She was formally taken over on 11 March 1920 in England and commissioned into the US Navy on 4 June. Frankfurt was towed to the United States. The ship was ultimately expended as a bomb target on 18 July 1921 for United States Army Air Service and U.S. Navy bombers off Cape Henry, Virginia. The attacks started with small [...] and [...] bombs, which caused minor <b>hull</b> <b>damage.</b> The bombers then changed over to larger [...] and [...] bombs; Army Air Service Martin MB-2 bombers hit Frankfurt with several of the 600lb bombs and sank the ship at 18:25.|$|E
500|$|In 1969, King again {{tried and}} failed to {{circumnavigate}} in Galway Blazer II. In 1970, he was ready for another attempt, again using Galway Blazer II. Ill-health and <b>hull</b> <b>damage</b> forced him to put ashore at Australia. After departing on 12 December 1971, a large sea creature (a whale or shark) damaged his boat about [...] southwest of Fremantle. [...] "Only his skill and heroic efforts were able to keep the vessel afloat until jury repairs could be made". King was below deck when he heard a shattering sound and saw the hull below the water line bulge inward and splinter. He rushed upstairs and heeled the boat so that the hole was lifted out of the water. He had to hang over the side and submerge himself to carry out emergency repairs with material that included thirteen ropes, sticky tape, collision covers, sheet copper, and sponge rubber. Then he had to fix the inside of the hull as well. After three days of work, he was able to return to Fremantle, [...] "barely able to limp into port".|$|E
25|$|A {{compartment}} is {{a portion}} of the space within a ship defined vertically between decks and horizontally between bulkheads.
