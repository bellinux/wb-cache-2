5|$|Historically, Canada {{has been}} {{influenced}} by British, French, and indigenous cultures and traditions. Through their language, art and music, Indigenous peoples continue to influence the Canadian identity. During the 20th century, Canadians with African, Caribbean and Asian nationalities <b>have</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> the Canadian identity and its culture. Canadian humour {{is an integral part}} of the Canadian identity and is reflected in its folklore, literature, music, art and media. The primary characteristics of Canadian humour are irony, parody, and satire. Many Canadian comedians have archived international success in the American TV and film industries and are amongst the most recognized in the world.|$|E
5|$|Most states, {{including}} Alaska, do {{not allow}} samples after three hours and a preservative required to halt fermentation was not added to the sample. Fermentation could <b>have</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> the amount of alcohol in the sample, making the result invalid. As {{a result of the}} accident, in 1991 the United States Coast Guard suspended his masters' license for a period of nine months. Hazelwood was acquitted on all felony charges, but was convicted of a misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge of oil, fined $50,000, and sentenced to 1,000 hours of community service.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} fossils of megalodon are its teeth. Diagnostic {{characteristics}} include a triangular shape, robust structure, large size, fine serrations, {{a lack of}} lateral denticles, and a visible V-shaped neck (where the root meets the crown). The tooth met the jaw at a steep angle, similar to the great white shark. The tooth was anchored by connective tissue fibers, and the roughness of the base may <b>have</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> mechanical strength. The lingual side of the tooth, the part facing the tongue, was convex; and the labial side, {{the other side of}} the tooth, was slightly convex or flat. The anterior teeth were almost perpendicular to the jaw and symmetrical, whereas the posterior teeth were slanted and asymmetrical.|$|E

5|$|Their service records <b>have</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> their fame, {{ranging from}} their work as carrier escorts in World War II to their shore {{bombardment}} duties in North Korea, North Vietnam, and the Middle East, {{as well as their}} service in the Cold War against the expanded Soviet Navy. Their reputation combined with the stories told concerning the firepower of these battleships' 16-inch guns are such that when they were brought out of retirement in the 1980s in response to increased Soviet Naval activity—and in particular, in response to the commissioning of the s—the United States Navy was inundated with requests from former sailors pleading for a recall to active duty so they could serve aboard one of the battleships.|$|E
5|$|In {{baseball}} statistics tie-breakers {{count as}} regular season games, with all events in them added to regular season statistics. For example, the Chicago Sun-Times noted that Sammy Sosa could <b>have</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> his notable home run total in the game. Sosa did {{add to his}} league-leading strikeout total with one in the 4th inning. Beck also added to his league-leading total in games played and earned his 51st save of the season which finished 2nd to Trevor Hoffman's 53 but is tied for the 9th highest single-season save total in MLB history. Several Cubs and Giants won awards for their regular season performances including Rookie of the Year honors for Kerry Wood, a Silver Slugger Award for Sosa, and a Rawlings Gold Glove Award for J. T. Snow. Sosa also won the Most Valuable Player award, earning 30 out of 32 first place votes (with McGwire taking the remaining 2).|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Wallingford, Stephen and Henry spoke together privately about a potential end to the war; Stephen's son Eustace, however, was furious about the peaceful outcome at Wallingford. He left his father and returned home to Cambridge to gather more funds for a fresh campaign, where he fell ill and died the next month. Eustace's death removed an obvious claimant to the throne and was politically convenient for those seeking a permanent peace in England. It is possible, however, that Stephen {{had already begun to}} consider passing over Eustace's claim; historian Edmund King observes that Eustace's claim to the throne was not mentioned in the discussions at Wallingford, for example, and this may <b>have</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> Stephen's son's anger.|$|E

5|$|Jarlshof lies {{near the}} {{southern}} tip of the Shetland Mainland, close to the settlements of Sumburgh and Grutness and to the south end of Sumburgh Airport. The site overlooks an arm of the sea called the West Voe of Sumburgh and the nearby freshwater springs and building materials available on the beach will <b>have</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> the location's attraction as a settlement. The south Mainland also provides a favourable location for arable cultivation in a Shetland context and there is a high density of prehistoric settlement in the surrounding area. Jarlshof is only one mile from Scatness where the remains of another broch and other ruins of a similar longevity were discovered in 1975. There is a small visitor centre at Jarlshof with displays and a collection of artefacts.|$|E
5|$|Sources for William's actions between 1082 and 1084 are meagre. According to the {{historian}} David Bates, this probably means that little happened of note, and that because William {{was on the}} continent, {{there was nothing for}} the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle to record. In 1082 William ordered the arrest of his half-brother Odo. The exact reasons are unclear, as no contemporary author recorded what caused the quarrel between the half-brothers. Orderic Vitalis later recorded that Odo had aspirations to become pope. Orderic also related that Odo had attempted to persuade some of William's vassals to join Odo on an invasion of southern Italy. This would have been considered tampering with the king's authority over his vassals, which William would not have tolerated. Although Odo remained in confinement for the rest of William's reign, his lands were not confiscated. More difficulties struck in 1083, when William's eldest son Robert rebelled once more with support from the French king. A further blow was the death of Matilda, William's wife, on 2 November 1083. William was always described as close to his wife, and her death would <b>have</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> his problems.|$|E
5|$|The {{enormous}} {{effort of}} the estimated population of 100 to 150 thousand residents of the Gniezno region {{who were involved in}} building or modernizing Gniezno and several other main Piast gords was made in response to a perceived deadly threat, not just to help them pursue regional conquests. After 935, when the Gniezno people were probably already led by Mieszko's father Siemomysł, the Czechs conquered Silesia and soon moved also against Germany. The fear of desecration of their tribal cult center by the advancing Czechs could have mobilized the community. A Polabian Slav uprising was suppressed around 940 by Germany under Otto I, and the eastbound moving Saxons must <b>have</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> the sense of danger at that time (unless the Piast state was already allied with Otto, helping restrain the Polabians). When the situation stabilized, the Piast state consolidated and the huge gords turned out to be handy for facilitating the Piast's own expansion, led at this stage by Siemomysł.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the Crown Jewels—which mainly {{date from}} the {{accession}} of Charles II—the jewels are not official regalia or insignia. Much of the collection was designed for queens and queen consorts, though some kings <b>have</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> the collection. A few diamonds {{were brought to the}} United Kingdom from the British colonies and far away lands as the spoils of war. Most of the jewellery was purchased from other European heads of state and members of the aristocracy, or handed down by older generations of the Royal Family, often as birthday and wedding presents. In recent years, Elizabeth has worn them in her capacity as Queen of Australia, Canada and New Zealand, and can be seen wearing jewels from her collection in official portraits made specially for these realms.|$|E
