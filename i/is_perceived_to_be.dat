40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{perceived}} forms and drivers of sexual and gender based violence in post conflict settings with focus on Northern Uganda. It applied qualitative approaches primarily using in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Study findings revealed that although {{all forms of}} violence <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> prevalent, physical and emotional violence <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the most occurring. Men <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the main perpetrators of violence. However, there were cases of men who reported to experience violence from women. Few men reported violence <b>to</b> authorities because it <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stigmatizing; such men would <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as weak in a patriarchal society that <b>perceives</b> ideal men <b>to</b> <b>be</b> strong and less susceptible to physical, emotional and sexual abuse. Early marriages are a major form of gender based violence which <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> as normal {{in a number of}} communities despite the evidence that it contributes to negative social and reproductive health outcomes. Sexual violence cases in form of rape, defilement as well as incest <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on the rise in the sub-region. The study identified several drivers of SGBV including poverty, power imbalances in access to and control over resources, insecurity, blaming HIV infection on female partners, HIV related stigma and discrimination, alcohol and substance abuse...|$|R

40|$|This interpretive study, {{framed in}} {{relational}} dialectics theory, sought to identify stepchildren’s {{perceptions of the}} contradictions that animate communication with the stepparent in their household of primary residence. In-depth interviews were conducted, producing 802 pages of double-spaced interview transcripts, which were analyzed inductively for commonly experienced contradictions of stepchild-stepparent communication. Three underlying contradictions were identified. First, stepchild-stepparent communication <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> characterized by a dialectic of integration, characterized by both closeness and distance. Second, stepchild-stepparent communication <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> characterized by a dialectic of parental status, in which the stepparent was, and was not, granted legitimacy in a parent role. Third, stepchild-stepparent communication <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> animated by a dialectic of expression in which both candor and discretion were featured...|$|R

25|$|Sri Lankan {{women wear}} saris in many styles. Two ways of draping the sari are popular {{and tend to}} dominate: the Indian style (classic nivi drape) and the Kandyan style (or osaria in Sinhalese). The Kandyan style is {{generally}} more popular in the hill country region of Kandy from which the style gets its name. Though local preferences play a role, most women decide on style depending on personal preference or what <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> most flattering for their figure.|$|E
25|$|All {{exchange}} rates {{are susceptible to}} political instability and anticipations about the new ruling party. Political upheaval and instability can {{have a negative impact}} on a nation's economy. For example, destabilization of coalition governments in Pakistan and Thailand can negatively affect the value of their currencies. Similarly, in a country experiencing financial difficulties, the rise of a political faction that <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fiscally responsible can have the opposite effect. Also, events in one country in a region may spur positive/negative interest in a neighboring country and, in the process, affect its currency.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, newly learned {{words are}} seldom put into use. This arises because {{everyone}} in China communicates through Mandarin and English <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{of little use}} in the country. This is further reinforced through the national Band 4 examination where 80% of the test was the writing component, 20% was devoted to listening, and speaking was excluded entirely. According to a national survey, {{only half of the}} teachers consider that vocabulary should be learned through conversation or communication. A far smaller percentage support activities such as role playing or vocabulary games.|$|E

25|$|For some people, {{procrastination}} can be {{persistent and}} tremendously disruptive to everyday life. For these individuals, procrastination may be symptomatic of a psychological disorder. Procrastination {{has been linked}} to a number of negative associations, such as depression, irrational behaviour, low self-esteem, anxiety and neurological disorders such as ADHD. Others have found relationships with guilt and stress. Therefore, it is important for people whose procrastination has become chronic and <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> debilitating to seek out a trained therapist or psychiatrist to see if an underlying mental health issue may be present.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, the {{conversion}} of agricultural soil implied {{a net loss of}} potential. But the rapid loss in the area of arable soils appears to be economically meaningless because EU <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dependent on internal food supply anymore. During the period 2000–2006 the European Union lost 0.27% of its cropland and 0.26% of its crop productive potential. The loss of agricultural land during the same time was the highest in the Netherlands, which lost 1.57% of its crop production potential within six years. The figures are quite alarming for Cyprus (0.84%), Ireland (0.77%) and Spain (0.49%) as well.|$|E
25|$|According to this theory, coolness is a subjective, dynamic, socially-constructed trait, {{such that}} coolness {{is in the}} eye of the beholder. People {{perceive}} things (e.g., other people, products or brands) to be cool based on an inference of “autonomy”. That is, something <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cool when it follows its own motivations. However, this theory proposes that the level of autonomy that leads to coolness is constrained - inappropriate levels of autonomy, such that the autonomy is too high or opposes a legitimate norm, do not lead to perceptions of coolness. The level of autonomy considered appropriate is influenced by individual difference variables. For example, people who think of societal institutions and authority as unjust or repressive perceive coolness at higher levels of autonomy than those who are less critical of social norms and authority.|$|E

25|$|From 2015 all buses in Scotland {{will have}} to be {{disabled}} accessible to meet the Disability Discrimination Act. This act has caused a great deal of resentment in the bus industry as it will require a large amount of money to be spent modifying or buying new buses that comply with the act, for what <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> little benefit. It also sees a number of otherwise serviceable buses taken off the road and made worthless before the end of their natural life. In Scotland {{there are a number of}} situations where currently no suitable buses are manufactured that could operate due the hilly and uneven road conditions which damage disabled accessible vehicles. The Isle of Arran is one example, where extensive road improvements will be required before disabled accessible buses can be operated extensively on the island.|$|E
25|$|While the SAF was {{concerned}} {{of the safety}} of out gay and trans men living and working with straight servicemen it was also reluctant to exempt them from the compulsory National Service that all Singaporean men had to perform. However, post-operative male-to-female transsexuals were exempted from National Service as the Singapore Government recognised their new gender identity as women. It is unknown if post-operative female-to-male transsexuals perform National Service, though {{it is unlikely that}} many of them exist who have undergone their operation by the time of enlistment, around the age of 18. In any case, most homosexuals did (and do) not declare their sexual orientation during this examination and go on to serve in all variety of vocations. Gay men do not come out for many reasons, the most common being that they are not comfortable with declaring their sexuality to a State and organisation that <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> homophobic. Some gay men also refrain from coming out as they wish to perform their duties alongside others, and find the segregation of homosexuals offensive.|$|E
25|$|Functions of {{the state}} and federal attorneys-general include the {{administration}} of the selection of persons for nomination to judicial posts, and authorizing prosecutions. In normal circumstances, the prosecutorial powers of the Attorney-General are exercised by the Director of Public Prosecutions and staff; however, the Attorney-General maintains formal control, including the power to initiate and terminate public prosecutions and take over private prosecutions. Statutory criminal law provides that prosecutions for certain offences require the individual consent of the Attorney-General. This is generally for offences whose illegality is of a somewhat controversial nature or where there <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a significant risk that prosecutions of a political nature may be embarked upon. The Attorney-General also generally has the power to issue certificates legally conclusive of certain facts (e.g., that the revelation of certain matters in court proceedings might constitute a risk to national security); the facts stated in such certificates must be accepted by the courts and cannot legally be disputed by any parties. The Attorney-General also has the power to issue a nolle prosequi with respect to a case, which authoritatively determines that the state (in whose name prosecutions are brought) does not wish to prosecute the case, so preventing any person from doing so.|$|E

25|$|Today, {{the charge}} of {{vandalism}} in climbing is more often a disagreement about the appropriateness of drilling and placing permanent bolts and other anchors. Although new fixed anchors are rarely placed by climbers, their dependency on the existing fixed anchors results in {{the difference between life}} and death. But the existing anchors remain on the climbing structure for long periods of time, changing the dynamic of the structure itself. Due to the permanent impact of the fixed anchors in wilderness areas, it was prohibited by the Wilderness Act. However, in 1990, there was a movement by the Forest Service and the Task Group to change the regulations to where fixed anchors would be allowed but still regulated in wilderness areas. These improvements lead to protection for both the climbers and the Wilderness Act. Typically in the USA, the first ascensionists decide where to place protection on a new route and later climbers are supposed to live with these choices. This can cause friction and retro-bolting when the route <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dangerous to climbers who actually lead at the grade of the climb, since the first ascensionists often lead at a higher grade and therefore don't require as much protection. Failing to properly design a new route at its grade is considered arrogant and very poor form. Even in strongholds of rock-climbing tradition like Yosemite National Park, many routes are being gradually upgraded to safer standards of protection.|$|E
