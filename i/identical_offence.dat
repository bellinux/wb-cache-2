5000|$|After {{investigating}} an unregistered diploma mill, {{police had}} seized {{a copy of}} the names of the 400 students who had attended the school and arrested 24 of them, allegedly gathering the Muslim names off the list and finding dubious connections between them to report as a disrupted terrorist plot. Among the accusations, authorities alleged that the [...] "al-Qaeda sleeper cell" [...] had experimented with explosives, that one had taken flight training and others had been seen loitering around the Pickering power plant, and may have been targeting the CN Tower in Toronto. After criticism that the Muslim community in Canada had ignored the plight of the falsely accused men, 18 different men from the Greater Toronto Area were arrested three years later by Canadian authorities and charged with almost <b>identical</b> <b>offences.</b>|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the issue of penalties for crimes against humanity and war crimes as imposed by the judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). At the moment, if for example A murders B, C, and D {{in the course of}} an armed conflict, it appears to makes no difference in terms of penalties if he is ultimately convicted under crimes against humanity or war crimes, what appears to matter {{is the fact that he}} committed murder. This approach has the effect of obscuring the criminal intention and motives for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The main reason why the ICTY has persisted with this approach, is the fact that at present there appears to be no credible index for adopting a policy of relative sentencing for crimes against humanity and war crimes. The aim of this Article therefore is to advocate a method for imposing higher penalties for crimes against humanity vis-?-vis war crimes. Furthermore, this method will rely on the argument that crimes against humanity offences e. g. murder, rape and torture when committed with a discriminatory motive should attract higher penalties than <b>identical</b> <b>offences</b> when committed as war crimes.

40|$|Olusanya, O. (2004). Double Jeopardy Without Parameters: Re-characterization in International Criminal Law. Series Supranational Criminal Law: Capita Selecta, volume 2. Antwerp: Intersentia. RAE 2008 This book {{deals with}} the double {{jeopardy}} rule, namely the practice of multiple characterisation of the same facts, under different headings, in international criminal law. Such practice is problematic, {{due to the fact}} that know how it works within the context of international criminal law. How does one distinguish a situation in which an act may appear simultaneously to breach several criminal provisions, whilst in reality it violates only one, from another where the act does in fact breach more than one criminal provision? International crimes such as genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes cannot be confined a single category of well-defined offences such as murder, voluntary or involuntary manslaughter, theft, etc. Instead these crimes embrace broad clusters of <b>identical</b> <b>offences</b> and share certain general legal features. Multiple characterisation of the same facts under different headings in international criminal law is therefore a complex legal problem. Every case of multiple convictions based on one act is, at its best, a plausible conjecture which however every next judgment may turn out to be a counter judgment. This book provides a combination of innovative charts, analysis, debate and solutions. From a unique perspective it examanies the history of international crimes and the jurisprudence of World War II tribunals, contemporary ad hoc international criminal tribunals, the International Criminal Court and special courts, as well as national law on international crimes...|$|R
