ERTS- 1 imagery has identified when reclamation has proved successful, when little lateral extension {{has occurred in}} the strip mine, when water has filled an impoundment (4 - 5 acres), and detected narrow contour mines. It has been proven that the CCT contains more information than the imagery received from NASA. A stream is visible in the band 7 <b>digital</b> <b>printout</b> that is not visible in the imagery. Also narrow bodies of water between the high wall and spoils bank and small impoundments (2 - 3 acres) are observed in the <b>digital</b> <b>printout</b> and not in the imagery. Disruption maps (water and bare earth within the mined area) can be made by statistically processing the CCT (decision imagery) or mapping the <b>digital</b> <b>printout</b> with a Bendix digitizer. Reclamation maps will be produced in the near future through decision imagery. There seems little doubt that the mapping of present stripping and the monitoring of the strip mine cycle for changes are practical. Disruption mapping is now an operational capability...|$|E
40|$|Wide {{spread of}} {{printers}} and computers {{have led to}} increasing use of print documents in people's common life. While mass print, automatic print quality evaluation is necessary in the fast print process to avoid the quality defect immediately when it appears. Also, in many cases print materials are direct accessories to many criminal and terrorist acts, for example forge contract, hence print identification has become more importance. With the technology that is evolving as rapidly as conventional and digital printing, however, {{it is easy to}} lose track of the many processes and the many variables in each process. Furthermore, as digital prints often appear similar to one another and to prints of traditional processes, comparing <b>digital</b> and conventional <b>printouts</b> can be confusing. This research aims to examine and characterizing <b>digital</b> and conventional <b>printouts</b> and investigate whether digital prints outs are significantly different than conventional printouts which can then be used for management and control purposes. Prior efforts to characterize <b>digital</b> and conventional <b>printout</b> have been made, however it is based on visual examination (Gascoigne 2004, Jarry 1996 and Lloyd and Taub 1988). To address this issues, In order to evaluate the print quality automatically or identify the source of the printouts intelligently, this study research will fully utilised primary examination of print with the naked eye, a magnified view of its edges and surface will render additional information. A stereomicroscope that magnifies up to approximately 20 x to 50 x as an instrumentation. The print identification checklist as proposed by Jurgens C.

It is called The Function of Folk: Illustration, Narrative, Society The Third International Illustration Research Symposium ‘The Function of ‘Folk’: Illustration, Narrative, Society 8 th and 9 th November 2012, Ethnographic Museum, Krakow, Poland [URL] The Third ‘Illustration Research’ Symposium explores the idea of the {{illustrator}} as contemporary ‘folk’ artist, and asks what function the illustrator has within communities – local and global. Sessions are themed around key ideas, and cover ground such as the visual language and iconography of folk motifs on clothing, the cultural impact of ‘folk art’ in shaping national identity, the collaboration between publisher and folk artists in India, the engagement of illustrators with the public to create powerful personal narratives, the idea of folk icons, relational and pragmatic methods of creating illustration, the illustration of urban myths, and the exploration of cultural identities through narrative illustration. The diversity of illustration practice today is represented – from traditional techniques of paper cutting, drawing and printmaking to puppetry and performance alongside work created for digital platforms. With an impressively international line up of speakers and an exhibition of contemporary illustration inspired by the theme of the conference, this event is hosted by the Ethnographic Museum in Krakow. The event will be held in an evocative venue – the two beautifully restored historic buildings that house Krakow’s wonderful collection of ethnographic art. The organisers anticipate that most of the work will be displayed as <b>digital</b> <b>printouts</b> The event should be of interest to practitioners, academics, students of illustration, history, ethnography and cultural studies...|$|R

Their activities must be guided by research to produce measurable results contributed in reducing casualties and making roads safer. This paper provides detailed information about {{the second stage of}} the study for an evaluation of social legislation infringements for international haulage truck drivers involved in severe road transport accidents. The data were obtained from original sources of information: from <b>digital</b> tachograph <b>printouts,</b> analog tachograph data record sheets and attestations of activities. The aim of the second research stage was to find out to which extent the drivers involved in severe road traffic accidents (hereinafter RTA) have committed infringements more often and in larger quantities compared to the data obtained from the vehicle and driver regular roadside checks, i. e. compared with the drivers not involved in RTA. The second task for the paper is to analyze infringements by type and by level of drivers' riskiness {{to be involved in the}} RTA. The obtained findings and conclusions of in-depth case studies have been compiled, processed, analyzed and systematized by severity, quantity and type of simultaneously committed offences, installed tachograph type and other parameters. The statistical data have been grouped, systematized and analyzed according to the aim of the research. Based on various sources of information, an analysis of infringements for international haulage truck drivers was made between the obtained average amount of infringements per severe RTA case and per regular roadside check. The results of the research state that the drivers involved in severe RTA have committed considerably more infringements before the actual RTA has happened. The most part of infringements directly or indirectly refers to the lack of rest time and increased driving or overall working hours. These infringements for international haulage truck drivers are referred to be as major factors contributing to drivers' fatigue and high accidents risk...|$|R

40|$|This instrument, {{developed}} for quantitating fluorescence polarization immunoassays, automatically measures both polarization components and computes a polarization value corrected for background and optical bias. An electronically switched liquid crystal provides a non-mechanical means of rotating {{the plane of}} polarization in the excitation optics. The electronic design feattres digital integration and microprocessor controlled functions. Readings are made in disposable 12 X 75 mm round cul-ture tubes, in less than lOs. Results are precise to 0. 00 1 polarization unit, linear from iO- to 10 - 10 mol of fluo-rescein per liter, and correlate well with those obtained with other ‘high-peormance ” instrumentation. Clinical applications of fluorescence polarization immu-noassays have been encumbered {{by the lack of}} simple, low-cost, fast, and reliable instrumentation (1). Drawbacks of previously available fluorescence polarization instruments include their lack of automated data reduction, the necessity to use precision cuvettes, the cumbersome and unreliable manual rotation of polarizers, and the use of high-power light sources. One attempt to overcome these problems has been reported (2). Most systems described in the literature and available commercially have been designed for research ap-plications rather than for the clinical laboratory, where ease of use, low cost, reliability, and speed are essential. A bench-top analyzer has been developed to meet these requirements and bring fluorescence polarization immu-noassays to the clinical laboratory. This FPA (fluorescence polarization analyzer) features <b>digital</b> output, hard-copy <b>printout,</b> an electro-optical system designed to read samples in disposable culture tubes, automated data reduction, and an electronically switched liquid crystal that provides a non-mechanical and automatic means of rotating the plane of polarization of the excitation light...|$|R

Comparison of the thermal IR band temperatures over the rapidly melting snowcover {{in a number}} of locations in the Salt-Verde Arizona watershed by the U- 2 high altitude multispectral scanner, with temperatures for these same locations measured by the corresponding HCMM pass, indicate that the U- 2 temperatures are typically 5 C higher than the values analyzed from the HCMM infrared <b>digital</b> <b>printout.</b> Results tend to substantiate findings of other investigators that with the offset that has been applied to all HCMM data, the HCMM temperature values may, in fact, actually be 5 C too low. Analysis of differences between the HCMM day and night temperatures for selected snowcovered areas in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, derived from the daytime and nighttime printouts, show greater delta tau values for the sparsely vegetated higher elevations than for the lower elevation, more densely forested terrain. The differences for the 12 hour sequence are also greater in most instances than the 36 hour difference...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Many {{state-of-the-art}} and cutting-edge {{universities in}} the world rely on wooden notice board hanging on a wall to display announcements. The overreliance of this practice in a university is still not enough to pass relevant information round as {{some of these problems}} are encountered: (1) Multiple people struggle and cluster a single wooden notice board for information just released, e. g. Exam results. (2) People mutilate, remove or destroy paper notices from the notice board leaving other people to be uninformed. (3) Some people do not have the time to settle down and read all the relevant information posted on a notice board especially where <b>digital</b> <b>printout</b> cannot be made easily. (4) There is unregulated display of information, difficulty in storage and no efficient reference to past relevant information being posted. Taking a case study of Covenant University where information is a vital key for everybody’s progress on campus. This research work looks at the development of a Digital Notice Board (DNB) program, which can be installed on various computers connected together by local area network (LAN) so as to increase the rate at which relevant information is being disseminated to the public within a certain location. The major strength of DNB is its usability with large electronic screen for display of information on numerous strategic points on university campus...|$|E
