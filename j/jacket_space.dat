40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{behaviour}} in compression of RC columns externally strengthened with concrete jacketing is analysed and a cross-section {{analysis of the}} jacketed member under axial load and bending moment is developed. The focus was to study the effect of confinement of concrete jacket on concrete core and the behaviour of compressed bars with buckling effects. Some other important aspects such as shrinkage, creep, old to new concrete surfaces and bond split effects {{were not included in}} the model because: the use of thick non-shrink grout jacket and a well-roughened surface of old-to-new concrete was supposed; long term effects were included though corrective coefficients for monolithic behaviour proposed in the literature. A preliminary validation of the model adopted was made referring to the short-term experimental data available in the literature on the compressive behaviour of RC columns strengthened with concrete jacketing. Good agreement was obtained with the available data in terms of momentaxial force domains and moment–curvature diagrams. The analysis showed the effectiveness of this reinforcing technique in improving both the strength and the ductility of RC cross-sections of columns, highlighting the importance of an accurate choice of strengthened materials (concrete grade, thickness of <b>jacket,</b> <b>space</b> and diameter of stirrups, etc.) ...|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the carbon}} nanotube's {{superior}} mechanical properties, many structures have been proposed ranging from everyday items like clothes and sports gear to combat <b>jackets</b> and <b>space</b> elevators. However, the space elevator will require further efforts in refining carbon nanotube technology, as the practical tensile strength of carbon nanotubes must be greatly improved.|$|R

40|$|External {{confinement}} in {{the form}} of steel rings, tie bars, spirals and FRP wraps has been widely adopted for strengthening concrete-filled-steel-tube (CFST) columns. Previous experimental and theoretical studies have proved that it can improve the strength, elastic stiffness, ductility and interface bonding of CFST columns. However, in real engineering practise, CFST columns need to be strengthened are usually under pre-compressed axial load. The stress-lagging effect between the CFST columns and external confinement due to pre-loading has not yet been justified. In this paper, external confinement {{in the form}} of circular steel jacket is proposed to improve the uni-axial behaviour of CFST columns with and without pre-compressed axial load. An experimental study, consisting of 5 hollow-steel-tubes and 10 thin-walled CFST columns was conducted to examine the effectiveness of the proposed strengthening scheme. The main parameters were the concrete cylinder strength, <b>jacket</b> <b>spacing</b> and pre-compressed axial load level. Test results revealed that the steel jacket could improve the uni-axial behaviour of CFST columns and the stress-lagging could degrade this beneficial effect. In addition, a theoretical model developed by the authors previously was adopted to predict the uni-axial behaviour of the strengthening columns. Very good agreement has been obtained between the theoretical and experimental results...|$|R
5000|$|The 7N21 (Cyrillic: 7Н21) 9×19mm {{overpressure}} variant {{features an}} armour-piercing bullet and generates a peak pressure of [...] The 7N21 bullet features a hardened (subcaliber) steel penetrator core, enclosed by a bimetal <b>jacket.</b> The <b>space</b> between {{the core and}} jacket is filled with polyethylene, and {{the tip of the}} penetrator is exposed {{at the front of the}} bullet, to achieve better penetration. The penetration range for body armor is specified at up to 40 m. The MP-443 Grach and GSh-18 pistols and PP-19-01, PP-90M1 and PP-2000 submachine guns were designed for use with this overpressure cartridge. Jane's Infantry Weapons stated in 2003 that the 7N21 cartridge combines the 9×19mm Parabellum dimensions with a 9×21 mm Gyurza bullet design and was developed specifically for the penetration of body armor and for the MP-443 Grach pistol, the latest Russian service pistol.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, Betabrand {{launched}} a crowdfunding platform, similar to Kickstarter, so that users can crowdsource clothing concepts and prototypes into actual products. Since {{the inception of}} the crowdfunding platform, Betabrand has funded almost 100 garments, including its 'Dress Pant Yoga Pants' (dual purpose design to look like formal trousers) and an urban <b>jacket</b> modeled on <b>space</b> wear. A feature of production is the turnaround from initial design to sellable article - which can be in four to eight weeks. As of October, 2015, Betabrand carried more than 300 crowd-created products in its catalog.|$|R
50|$|As casting {{techniques}} improved, {{the entire}} cylinder block of four, six or even eight cylinders could be cast as one. This was a simpler construction, thus {{less expensive to}} make, and the communal water <b>jacket</b> permitted closer <b>spacing</b> between cylinders. This also improved the mechanical stiffness of the engine, against bending and the increasingly important torsional twist, as cylinder numbers and engine lengths increased. In the context of aircraft engines, the non-monobloc precursor to monobloc cylinders was a construction where the cylinders (or at least their liners) were cast as individuals, and the outer water jacket was applied later from copper or steel sheet. This complex construction was expensive, but lightweight, {{and so it was}} only widely used for aircraft.|$|R
