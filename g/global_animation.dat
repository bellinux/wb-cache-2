In this paper, we present our experimental approach to simulate the complex behavior of long human hair, taking into account hairto -hair interactions. We describe a thin shell volume (TSV) model for enhancing hair realism by simulating complex hair-hair interaction. The TSV is a thin bounding volume that encloses a given hair surface. The TSV method enables virtual hair combing for surface-model hairstyles. Combing produces the effects of hair-hair interaction that occur in real human hair.

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} novel method for fast, high quality {{computation}} of glossy global illumination in animated environments. Building on the irradiance caching and radiance caching algorithms, our method leverages temporal coherence by sparse temporal sampling and interpolation of the indirect lighting. In our approach, {{part of the}} global illumination solution computed in previous frames is reused in the current frame. Our reusing scheme adapts to the change of incoming radiance by updating the indirect lighting only {{where there is a}} significant change. By reusing data in several frames, our method removes the flickering artifacts and yields a significant speedup compared to classical computation in which a new cache is computed for every frame. We also define temporal gradients for smooth temporal interpolation. A key aspect of our method is the absence of any additional complex data structure, making the implementation into any existing renderer based on irradiance and radiance caching straightforward. We describe the implementation of our method using graphics hardware for improved performance.

40|$|Abstract. While {{techniques}} {{exist for}} simulating swarming behaviors, these methods usually provide only simplistic navigation and planning capabilities. In this review, we explore {{the benefits of}} integrating roadmapbased path planning methods with flocking techniques to achieve different behaviors. We show how group behaviors such as exploring can be facilitated by using dynamic roadmaps (e. g., modifying edge weights) as an implicit means of communication between flock members. Extending ideas from cognitive modeling, we embed behavior rules in individual flock members and in the roadmap. These behavior rules enable the flock members to modify their actions based on their current location and state. We propose new techniques for several distinct group behaviors: homing, exploring (covering and goal searching), passing through narrow areas and shepherding. We present results that show that our methods provide significant improvement over methods that utilize purely local knowledge and moreover, that we achieve performance approaching that which could be obtained by an ideal method that has complete <b>global</b> knowledge. <b>Animations</b> of these behaviors can be viewed on our webpages. ...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, the global flow of {{cultural}} {{goods and services}} has significantly grown {{as a result of}} liberalized international trade and investment and technological advance. Global cultural production is now flexibly organized and decentralized as more tasks are outsourced into different parts of the world. Yet, the question of how globalization has affected the structure of global cultural industries and upgrading dynamics has not been taken seriously. This study takes up this question by examining the animation industry in South Korea ("Korea" hereafter) and its changing relationship with <b>global</b> <b>animation</b> production from an historical-comparative perspective from the mid- 1960 s to the late 2000 s. This study attempts to answer several main questions: 1) How did two waves of globalization differently reshape the structure the <b>global</b> <b>animation</b> industry? 2) What are the major characteristics of the Korean animation industry at different stages? 3) How did the differences between U. S. and Japanese outsourcing chains and international coproduction chains affect the upgrading outcomes of Korean suppliers? and 4) Has the Korean state's developmental role been declined, preserved, or reconfigured over time? Based upon secondary literature and the author's field interviews in Korea, India and Japan in 2008 and 2009, this study finds that the animation industry has been globalized over the last four decades with two distinctive waves of globalization. The first wave until the 1980 s involved the rise of offshore outsourcing networks linking the U. S. market to East Asian suppliers. The second wave beginning in the 1990 s has restructured the industry through the consolidation and global expansion of media conglomerates, the relocation of offshore outsourcing, and the growth of animation production and consumption in emerging economies. Throughout the period, the Korean animation industry has undergone three distinctive phases in terms of its development patterns. The development path has been constructed by the interaction of global linkages and local dynamics. The first phase leading up to the mid- 1980 s is characterized by a gradual integration to global production networks through small-scale processing. The ensuring large-scale, outsourcing-based export growth defines the second phase up {{until the end of the}} 1990 s. The latest phase is the outcome of a new path in the late 1990 s toward upgrading based on local production and international coproduction. The disaggregation of global forces at the global value chain (GVC) level shows marked differences between U. S. and Japanese outsourcing chains in terms of chain structure, division of labor, firm characteristics, and chain governance. These differences generated distinctive upgrading patterns among two segmented local supplier groups. A quick build-up of large-scale production by consolidated suppliers in the U. S. chains (yet their equally quick decline later) contrasts to a slower pace of upgrading by a large group of fragmented suppliers in Japanese chains. While the structure of emerging international coproduction chains varies by project, power relations between the partner firms are critical to determine the gains captured. Finally, as for the role of the state, the finding of this study supports the reconfiguration argument that the developmental state, at least in Korea, is not in eclipse but bolstered with a new mode of state intervention and developmental alliance. In the face of growing competitiveness pressure on Korean firms at home and abroad, state-led, export-oriented development strategies have been rather strengthened and extended. Sector-specific industrial policy has increased, not decreased, particularly after the economic crisis of the late 1990 s. Industrial policy has been narrowed onto the sector level and strategically engaged in specific chain nodes within the sector. Organizationally, this policy reform was supported by a newly-minted developmental alliance based on original animation exports and the re-embedding of the state onto specialized supportive agencies and new policy constituencies. These findings are compared and contrasted to the experience of the Indian animation industry to draw implications for upgrading in the global cultural economy, which include: a) globalization as a differentiating and restructuring process; b) the interaction between global integration and local production; c) linkages between local, regional and global markets; and d) value chain-based state intervention.

40|$|International audienceThe {{computation}} {{of global}} illumination in a dynamic scene constitutes {{a real challenge}} in computer graphics. In radiosity algorithms, this problem {{is far from being}} easy, especially when light sources move in a complex scene. This subject becoming more and more widespread, many algorithms have been presented to solve the dynamic radiosity problem. Unfortunately, none uses intensive temporal coherence and few are efficient when dealing with a moving light source. This paper introduces a new algorithm that computes animations with any moving surfaces - even light sources. We take into account the temporal coherence between two frames to determine only the luminous energy differences between the previous global illumination solution and the new one. A mathematical development of the form factor for a translation or a rotation avoids unnecessary form factors computations. This new approach leads to an efficient and simple algorithm, similar to the classical progressive refinement method. Thus, it is able to compute the <b>global</b> illumination of <b>animations</b> at least twice faster than the classical approach...|$|R
