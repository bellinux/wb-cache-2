40|$|A novel {{approach}} for protecting jet fuel against {{the effects of}} water contamination based upon Fuel Dehydrating <b>Icing</b> <b>Inhibitors</b> (FDII) is presented. This dual-action strategy is predicated on kinetically-fast, selective, lipophilic water scavengers that produce, upon hydrolysis, a hydrophilic <b>ice</b> <b>inhibitor.</b> Criteria for an optimum FDII were identified then used to screen a range of potential water scavenging agents, {{which led to a}} closer examination of systems based upon exo/endo-cyclic ketals, and both endo-and exo-cyclic ortho esters. The ice inhibition properties of the subsequent products of the hydrolysis reaction in Jet A- 1 were screened by differential scanning calorimetry. The hydrolysis products of 2 -methoxy- 2 -methyl- 1, 3 -dioxolane demonstrates similar ice inhibition performance to DiEGME over a range of blend levels. The calorific values for the products of hydrolysis were also investigated and it is clear {{that there would be a}} significant fuel saving on use of the additive over current fuel system <b>icing</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> Finally, three promising candidates, 2 -methoxy- 2 -methyl- 1, 3 - dioxolane, 2 -methoxy- 2 -methyl- 1, 3 -dioxane and 2 -methoxy- 2, 4, 5 - trimethyl- 1, 3 -dioxolane were shown to effectively dehydrate Jet A- 1 at room temperature over a two hour period...|$|R

50|$|Fuel system <b>icing</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (FSII) is an {{additive}} to aviation fuels {{that prevents}} {{the formation of}} ice in fuel lines. FSII is sometimes referred to by the registered, genericized trademark Prist. Jet fuel can contain {{a small amount of}} dissolved water that does not appear in droplet form. As an aircraft gains altitude, the temperature drops and Jet fuel's capacity to hold water is diminished. Dissolved water can separate out and could become a serious problem if it freezes in fuel lines or filters, blocking the flow of fuel and shutting down an engine.|$|E
40|$|Dissolved {{water is}} a normal {{component}} of jet fuel which is vapourised during combustion; however, free {{water is a}} contaminant that can starve engines, freeze to form ice crystals capable of blocking fuel feeds, support microbial growth, and contribute towards corrosion. Jet fuel may be protected from the potentially hazardous effects of free-water using biocides and icing/corrosion inhibitors. This investigation seeks to identify novel chemical approaches to the dual management of both water contamination and ice formation in jet fuel. The strategy of using organic molecules as dehydrating agents remains a relatively neglected approach {{perhaps because of the}} complexity of the physical organic chemistry involved in developing and refining these systems. However, organic molecules with well characterised dehydrating properties - such as ortho esters, acetals, hemiacetals, ketals, and hemiketals - present themselves as an excellent starting-point for the development and optimisation of novel Fuel Dehydrating <b>Icing</b> <b>Inhibitors</b> (FDII). This paper describes our systematic approach towards the development of jet fuel additives which are kinetically fast, selective, lipophilic water scavengers that produce, upon hydrolysis, a hydrophilic <b>ice</b> <b>inhibitor.</b> A brief human and environmental toxicological screening of candidates is described. We anticipate that this class of FDII represents a novel approach towards protecting jet fuel against the effects of water contamination. ...|$|R

This study investigates the effects of pralnacasan on cytokine expression in DSS-induced colitis. Colitis was induced by oral administration of DSS. Mice were treated intraperitoneally with the <b>ICE</b> <b>inhibitor</b> pralnacasan (50 mg/kg body weight twice daily). Body weight {{as well as the}} presence of occult blood or diarrhea was monitored daily. Subgroups were sacrificed at days 4, 8, and 11 after the beginning of DSS application. Cytokine profiles in colonic tissue were analyzed on the protein level by ELISA and on the mRNA level by real time RT-PCR. Administration of DSS led to an increase in IL- 18, IL- 12, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma protein as well as IP- 10 and TNF-alpha mRNA. The increase in IL- 18 and IFN-gamma was reduced by ICE inhibition. Pralnacasan prevented DSS-induced colitis in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. In C 57 BL/ 6 mice, the DSS-induced increase in IP- 10 mRNA, but not TNF-alpha mRNA, was completely prevented by ICE inhibition. In conclusion, prevention of colitis in C 57 BL/ 6 mice was associated with a suppresion of IP- 10 mRNA, but not TNF-alpha mRNA expression, indicating that IL- 18 -mediated cytokine production is a key element in the pathogenesis of DSS-induced coliti...|$|R
40|$|Interleukin- 1 beta {{converting}} enzyme (ICE) is a cysteine protease that catalyzes {{the conversion}} of the inactive precursor form of IL- 1 beta to an active mature form. The mature form of IL- 1 beta is involved in mediating inflammatory responses and in the progression of autoimmune diseases. We recently reported on the production of active human ICE in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system (Wang XM et al., 1994, Gene 145 : 273 - 277). Because the levels of expression achieved with this system were limiting for the purpose of performing detailed biochemical and biophysical studies, we examined the production of ICE in Escherichia coli. By using a tac promoter-based expression system and fusion to thioredoxin we were able to recover high levels of active ICE protein. The expressed protein, which was distributed between the soluble and insoluble fractions, was purified to homogeneity from both fractions using a combination of classical and affinity chromatography. Comparisons of ICE derived from both fractions indicated that they were comparable in their specific activities, subunit composition, and sensitivities to specific <b>ICE</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> The combined yields of ICE obtained from the soluble and insoluble fractions was close to 1 mg/L of induced culture.

It has been included in the digital archive for its historical value to NPS. Not believed to be a CIVINS (Civilian Institutions) title. The jet fuel currently used by the United States Air Force requires an anti-icing additive because of the long range, high altitude aircraft now in use. When transporting this jet fuel by tanker, all water must be removed from the vessel's tanks since the additive is highly soluble in water. In his three years experience as a petroleum inspector, the author has observed that tankers lifting JP 4 are delayed approximately 12 hours per cargo at a cost of approximately $ 2, 000 per cargo because of this tank drying requirement. Upon assignment to the University of Kansas in the Navy sponsored Petroleum Management Post Graduate Program, the author undertook, as his thesis project, the development of a less costly method of loading JP 4, basing his study primarily upon laboratory tests but realizing that actual field tests would be required for conclusive results. Laboratory tests conducted indicate that the <b>icing</b> <b>inhibitor</b> concentration in the fuel may be maintained within the military specification limits of 0. 10 - 0. 15 per cent as long as a sufficient quantity of inhibitor is injected to satisfy the equilibrium concentration requirement of the water remaining aboard the vessel after normal deb al lasting., In most cases, no more <b>icing</b> <b>inhibitor</b> is required than is called for by the maximum military specification limit. Tests conducted at the University of Kansas and the author's own experience in loading tankers indicate that extensive savings in tine and money may be realized by using the proposed method. Using the new method could result in a savings of approximately 12 hours turn-a-round time per cargo lifted, a savings which is of immediate significance to the military. By using the new method, a savings of approximately $ 2, 000 per cargo in drying time could also be realized, a savings of immediate significance to tanker operators. On a yearly basis, the author estimates that more than 4, 000 hours in tanker turn-a-round could be saved as well as $ 700, 000 in drying costs. Th-j author recommends, therefore, that field tests be conducted using actual vessels and that if these tests are successful the new method be adopted as soon as possible. [URL]...|$|E

These chemicals are water-soluble components of jet and motor fuels accidentally disposed to the environment. Titanium dioxide (Degussa P 25) under near-UV irradiation {{was selected as}} a photocatalyst. A slightly acidic medium was preferable for the process efficiency for MTBE, whereas a neutral medium was beneficial for de-icing agents and jet fuel aqueous extracts. TiO 2 suspension fractional composition {{was found to be}} dependent on pH and the presence of organic admixtures: the minimum size of TiO 2 particles at their maximum uniformity was established in an acidic medium, where the efficiency of PCO of de-icing agents was the poorest. On the other hand, neutral and slightly acidic media, beneficial for PCO efficiency, were favourable for particle agglomeration, which indicates a minimal role for photocatalyst particle size in PCO efficiency. PCO efficiency increased with increasing MTBE and <b>icing</b> <b>inhibitor</b> concentration. The biodegradability of aqueous solutions of oxygenated additives increased as PCO proceeded. The influence of mineral additives—sulphate, calcium, ferric and manganese ions—on the process efficiency was found to be complex.

Using ratio of pristine/phytane, we were able to distinguished fuel type between kerosene and JP- 8 samples, which was impossible by GC/FID pattern.

It is very important that 2, 4 -dimethyl- 6 -tert-butyl phenol, an antioxidant used only for JP- 8, was detected in free product samples. The concentration of sulfur in kerosene fuel is much lower than that of JP- 8, and the total contents of sulfur in environmental samples can be used to differentiate the fuel type of spilled oil between kerosene and JP- 8.

In this study Fas activated the stress-responsive mitogen-activated protein kinases, p 38 and JNK, within 2 h in Jurkat T lymphocytes but not the mitogen-responsive kinase ERK 1 or pp 70 S 6 k. Fas activation of p 38 correlated temporally {{with the onset of}} apoptosis, and transfection of constitutively active MKK 3 (glu), an upstream regulator of p 38, potentiated Fas-induced cell death, suggesting a potential involvement of the MKK 3 /p 38 activation pathway in Fas-mediated apoptosis. Fas has been shown to require ICE (interleukin- 1 beta-converting enzyme) family proteases to induce apoptosis from studies utilizing the cowpox <b>ICE</b> <b>inhibitor</b> protein CrmA, the synthetic tetrapeptide <b>ICE</b> <b>inhibitor</b> YVAD-CMK, and the tripeptide pan-ICE inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. In this study, crmA antagonized, and YVAD-CMK and Z-VAD-FMK completely inhibited, Fas activation of p 38 kinase activity, demonstrating that Fas-dependent activation of p 38 requires ICE/CED- 3 family members and conversely that the MKK 3 /p 38 activation cascade represents a downstream target for the ICE/CED- 3 family proteases. Intriguingly, p 38 activation by sorbitol and etoposide was resistant to YVAD-CMK and Z-VAD-FMK, suggesting the existence of an additional mechanism(s) of p 38 regulation. The ICE/CED- 3 family-p 38 regulatory relationship described in the current work indicates that in addition to the previously described destructive cleavage of substrates such as poly(ADP ribose) polymerase, lamins, and topoisomerase, the apoptotic cysteine proteases also function to regulate stress kinase signalling cascades...|$|R

40|$|CTLL cells undergo {{apoptosis}} when cultured in {{the absence}} of IL- 2. The IL- 1 β-converting-enzyme (ICE) / caspase family has been implicated as an integral component of some forms of apoptosis. Numerous members of the caspase family have been identified, and it appears as if caspase- 3 /CPP 32 plays a critical role. Previously we demonstrated that ICE/caspase- 1 expression increases in CTLL cells during apoptosis; however, inhibition of ICE activity did not abrogate apoptotic death. The purpose of this report is to determine if other members of the caspase family are involved in T cell apoptosis induced by growth factor starvation. We show that cytosolic CPP 32 -like activity, as measured by the cleavage of DEVD-pNA and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), increases during apoptosis following growth factor deprivation. Cytosolic CPP 32 -like activity is inhibited in cells treated with the broad spectrum <b>ICE</b> family <b>inhibitor</b> boc-aspartyl(OMe) -fluoromethylketone (D-FMK) and by VAD-FMK and DEVD-FMK which have greater specificity for CPP 32 -like ICE homologs; however, only the broad spectrum <b>ICE</b> <b>inhibitor</b> D-FMK inhibited apoptosis.

Circulating cytokines may promote myocardial dysfunction (stunning) after ischemia. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether ICE inhibition by HMR- 3840 improves myocardial stunning in vivo. METHODS: Anesthetized (isoflurane and fentanyl) pigs {{were used for}} measurement of left ventricular (LV) pressure, cardiac output and blood flow in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and left circumflex coronary artery. Regional myocardial function was assessed by sonomicrometry as systolic wall thickening and mean systolic thickening velocity in the anteroapical and posterobasal walls. The animals were subjected to 10 min of LAD occlusion followed by 4 h of reperfusion. The <b>ICE</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (flow-adjusted to achieve coronary plasma concentrations of 10 mug/mL) (ISCH, n= 7) or the vehicle (CON, n= 7) was infused via a side branch into the LAD during ischemia, or during ischemia and the first 60 min of reperfusion (REP, n= 6). RESULTS: Occlusion of the LAD resulted in systolic outward movement (bulging) of the anteroapical wall during ischemia in all groups. Infusion of the <b>ICE</b> <b>inhibitor</b> {{had no effect on}} functional recovery when given during ischemia or when given during reperfusion (at the end of reperfusion in the anteroapical wall, values for systolic wall thickening were: CON 17. 3 +/- 7. 3 %, ISCH 23. 2 +/- 9. 8 % and REP 19. 3 +/- 6. 1 %; and values for mean systolic thickening velocity were: CON 4. 3 +/- 1. 1 mm/s, ISCH 6. 1 +/- 3. 9 mm/s and REP 5. 2 +/- 1. 7 mm/s; all P values not significant for CON versus ISCH or REP).

Over time, players learn {{that she is}} in fact leading the player-character Chell to her death. [...] As Chell escapes her control, GLaDOS's announcements get increasingly personal and farcical. [...] Her personality {{has been described as}} passive-aggressive, witty, narcissistic, and sinister. She has a number of system personality cores installed into her, partly in order to prevent her from killing anyone. At the climax of the game, Chell enters GLaDOS' chambers, where it is revealed that she's actually a complex artificial intelligence system composed of robotic parts hanging from a larger device. Once the player removes the first personality core, the morality core, GLaDOS' voice becomes less robotic and more sensual. Originally, GLaDOS was designed as an artificial intelligence and research assistant meant to aid Aperture Science in competing with the Black Mesa Research Facility on the creation of portal technology. Later proposed uses for GLaDOS included implementation as a fuel line <b>ice</b> <b>inhibitor</b> and disk operating system. GLaDOS is installed to serve as the Enrichment Center's central control computer, mounted in a large, sealed chamber alongside several control consoles and an incinerator, the latter being her eventual demise.|$|R
40|$|These studies {{demonstrate}} that treatment of human U- 937 cells with ionizing radiation (IR) {{is associated with}} activation of a cytoplasmic myelin basic protein (MBP) kinase. Characterization of the kinase by gel filtration and in-gel kinase assays support activation of a 40 kDa protein. Substrate and inhibitor studies further support the induction of protein kinase C (PKC) -like activity. The results of N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the purified protein demonstrate identity of the kinase with an internal region of PKC delta. Immunoblot {{analysis was used to}} confirm proteolytic cleavage of intact 78 kDa PKC delta in control cells to the 40 kDa C-terminal fragment after IR exposure. The finding that both IR-induced proteolytic activation of PKC delta and endonucleolytic DNA fragmentation are blocked by Bcl- 2 and Bcl-xL supports an association with physiological cell death (PCD). Moreover, cleavage of PKC delta occurs adjacent to aspartic acid at a site (QDN) similar to that involved in proteolytic activation of interleukin- 1 beta converting enzyme (ICE). The specific tetrapeptide <b>ICE</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (YVAD) blocked both proteolytic activation of PKC delta and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in IR-treated cells. These findings {{demonstrate that}} PCD is associated with proteolytic activation of PKC delta by an ICE-like protease...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Nef protein of HIV- 1 binds to and induces {{apoptotic}} cytolysis of uninfected but activated human {{peripheral blood}} mononuclear cells (PBMC) and various cell line cells derived from CD 4 + T, CD 8 + T and B lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. The Nef-induced apoptosis also occurs with blood cells not expressing CD 95 (Fas). The Nef-induced apoptosis {{as well as}} Fas-mediated apoptosis was inhibited by acetyl-Try-Val-Ala-Asp-CHO, an IL- 1 β converting enzyme (<b>ICE)</b> <b>inhibitor.</b> On the other hand, serine/threonine protein kinase (PK) inhibitors, H- 7, fasudil hydrochloride and M 3, inhibited the Nef-induced apoptosis, and not the Fas-mediated one, without affecting the cell-binding activity of Nef and Nef-binding capacity of the activated cells. Preincubation of the cells with the drugs before being bound by Nef was required for the inhibition of apoptosis. These results suggest that the PK inhibitors specifically act on a cellular protein involved in the upper stream of signal transduction pathway of the Nef-induced apoptosis, which is different from the Fas-mediated pathway but meets it upstream of ICE. In addition, the drugs suppressed the cellular activation-associated cell surface expression of a putative Nef-binding protein in PBMC, although they had no influence on its expression in cell line cells. These findings suggest the feasibility of clinical use of the PK inhibitors to prevent the development of AIDS by inhibiting the Nef-induced apoptosis of uninfected blood cells...|$|R
40|$|To {{explore the}} role of the {{interleukin}} (IL) - 1 � converting enzyme (ICE) in neuronal apoptosis, we designed a mutant ICE gene (C 285 G) that acts as a dominant negative <b>ICE</b> <b>inhibitor.</b> Microinjection of the mutant ICE gene into embryonal chicken dorsal root ganglial neurons inhibits trophic factor withdrawal–induced apoptosis. Transgenic mice expressing the fused mutant ICE-lacZ gene {{under the control of the}} neuron specific enolase promoter appeared neurologically normal. These mice are deficient in processing pro–IL- 1 �, indicating that mutant ICE C 285 G blocks ICE function. Dorsal root ganglial neurons isolated from transgenic mice were resistant to trophic factor withdrawal–induced apoptosis. In addition, the neurons isolated from newborn ICE knockout mice are similarly resistant to trophic factor withdrawal–induced apoptosis. After permanent focal ischemia by middle cerebral artery occlusion, the mutant ICE C 285 G transgenic mice show significantly reduced brain injury as well as less behavioral deficits when compared to the wild-type controls. Since ICE is the only enzyme with IL- 1 � convertase activity in mice, our data indicates that the mutant ICE C 285 G inhibits ICE, and hence mature IL- 1 � production, and through this mechanism, at least in part, inhibits apoptosis. Our data suggest that genetic manipulation using ICE family dominant negative inhibitors can ameliorate the exten...|$|R
