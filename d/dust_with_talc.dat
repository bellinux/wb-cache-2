40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} work was to obtain directly compressible agglomerates of ibuprofen <b>with</b> <b>talc</b> by a novel crystallo-co-agglomeration (CCA) technique, which {{is an extension of}} spherical crystallization. Ibuprofen-talc agglomerates were prepared using dichloromethane (DCM) -water as the crystallization system. DCM acted as a good solvent for ibuprofen as well as a bridging liquid for agglomeration of crystallized drug <b>with</b> <b>talc.</b> The agglomerates were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry, powder X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy and were evaluated for tableting properties and for drug release. The process yielded spherical agglomerates containing ∼ 95 % to 96 % wt/wt of ibuprofen. Agglomerates containing talc showed uniform distribution of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and decreased crystallinity, and deformed under pressure. The miniscular form of ibuprofen and the hydrophobicity of talc governed the drug release rate. The batch containing a higher proportion of talc showed zeroorder kinetics and drug release was extended up to 13 hours.

AT ceramics with additives have shown enhanced sinterability at 1550 °C, achieving close to 99 % of TD (theoretical density) in comparison to 87 % TD, exhibited with pure AT samples sintered at 1600 °C, and found to be in agreement with the microstructural observations.

40|$|Background and {{objective}} Malignant pleural effusion {{is associated with}} morbidity and mortality. A randomized controlled trial previously compared clinical outcomes and resource use with indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) and talc pleurodesis in this population. Using unpublished quality of life data, we estimate the cost-effectiveness of IPC compared <b>with</b> <b>talc</b> pleurodesis. Methods Healthcare utilization and costs were captured during the trial. Utility weights produced by the EuroQol Group five-dimensional three-level questionnaire and survival {{were used to determine}} qualityadjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated over the 1 -year trial period. Sensitivity analysis used patient survival data and modelled additional nursing time required per week for catheter drainage. Results Utility scores, cost and QALYs gained did not differ significantly between groups. The ICER for IPC compared <b>with</b> <b>talc</b> was favorable at $US 10 870 per QALY gained. IPC was less costly with a probability exceeding 95 % of being cost-effective when survival was Conclusion IPC is cost-effective when compared <b>with</b> <b>talc,</b> although substantial uncertainty exists around this estimate. IPC appears most cost-effective in patients with limited survival. If significant nursing time is required for catheter drainage, IPC becomes less likely to be cost-effective. Either therapy may be considered as a first-line option in treating malignant pleural effusion in patients without history of prior pleurodesis, with consideration for patient survival, support and preferences. </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Malignant pleural {{effusion}} {{is associated with}} short life expectancy and significant morbidity. A randomized controlled trial comparing indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) <b>with</b> <b>talc</b> pleurodesis found that IPCs reduced in-hospital time {{and the need for}} additional procedures but were associated with excess adverse events. METHODS: Using data from the clinical trial, we compared costs associated with use of IPCs and <b>with</b> <b>talc</b> pleurodesis. Resource use and adverse events were captured through case report forms over the 1 -year trial follow-up. Costs for outpatient and inpatient visits, diagnostic imaging, nursing, and doctor time were obtained from the UK National Health Service reference costs and University of Kent's Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 2011 and inflated to 2013 using the UK Consumer Price Index. Procedure supply costs were obtained from the manufacturer. Difference in mean costs was compared using nonparametric bootstrapping. All costs were converted to US dollars using the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Purchasing Power Parity Index. RESULTS: Overall mean cost (SD) for managing patients <b>with</b> IPCs and <b>talc</b> pleurodesis was $ 4, 993 ($ 5, 529) and $ 4, 581 ($ 4, 359), respectively. The incremental mean cost difference was $ 401, with 95 % CI of -$ 1, 387 to $ 2, 261. The mean cost related to ongoing drainage in the IPC group was $ 1, 011 ($ 732) vs $ 57 ($ 213) in the talc pleurodesis group (P =. 001). This included the cost of drainage bottles, dressing changes in the first month, and catheter removal. There {{was no significant difference in}} cost of the initial intervention or adverse events between the groups. For patients with survival < 14 weeks, IPC is significantly less costly than <b>talc</b> pleurodesis, <b>with</b> mean cost difference of -$ 1, 719 (95 % CI, -$ 3, 376 to -$ 85). CONCLUSIONS: There is no significant difference in the mean cost of managing patients with IPCs compared <b>with</b> <b>talc</b> pleurodesis.
