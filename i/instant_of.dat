Christ is naked except for a transparent veil, with some of his pubic hair visible. His hands and feet are nailed to the timber; the blood from the nail holding his feet to the cross stains its wooden base. His arms strain under the weight of his upper body, and in his final agony, his jaw has fallen slack; his mouth is open with his teeth exposed in the grimace of death. In the mid-ground, {{at the base of the}} cross, Longinus, on horseback, wearing a fur-trimmed hat and green tunic, guided by an assistant, stretches to pierce Jesus' side with a lance, as deep-red blood pours from the wound. To the right of Longinus, a mostly obscured Stephaton holds high a sponge soaked with vinegar on the tip of a reed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This letter {{proposes a}} time-effective method for {{determining}} the <b>instants</b> <b>of</b> significant excitation in speech signals. The <b>instants</b> <b>of</b> significant excitation correspond to the <b>instants</b> <b>of</b> glottal closure (epochs) {{in the case of}} voiced speech, and to some random excitations like onset of burst in the case of nonvoiced speech. The proposed method consists of two phases: the first phase determines the approximate epoch locations using the Hilbert envelope of the linear prediction residual of the speech signal. The second phase determines the accurate locations <b>of</b> the <b>instants</b> <b>of</b> significant excitation by computing the group delay around the approximate epoch locations derived from the first phase. The accuracy in determining the <b>instants</b> <b>of</b> significant excitation and the time complexity of the proposed method is compared with the group delay based approach.

40|$|Abstract—Prosody {{modification}} involves {{changing the}} pitch {{and duration of}} speech without affecting the message and naturalness. This paper proposes a method for prosody (pitch and duration) modification using the <b>instants</b> <b>of</b> significant excitation of the vocal tract system during the production <b>of</b> speech. The <b>instants</b> <b>of</b> signifi-cant excitation correspond to the <b>instants</b> <b>of</b> glottal closure (epochs) {{in the case of}} voiced speech, and to some random excitations like onset of burst in the case <b>of</b> nonvoiced speech. <b>Instants</b> <b>of</b> significant excitation are computed from the linear prediction (LP) residual of speech signals by using the property of average group-delay of minimum phase signals. The modification of pitch and duration is achieved by manipulating the LP residual {{with the help of the}} knowledge <b>of</b> the <b>instants</b> <b>of</b> significant excitation. The modified residual is used to excite the time-varying filter, whose parameters are derived from the original speech signal. Perceptual quality of the synthesized speech is good and is without any significant distor-tion. The proposed method is evaluated using waveforms, spectro-grams, and listening tests. The performance of the method is com-pared with linear prediction pitch synchronous overlap and add (LP-PSOLA) method, which is another method for prosody ma-nipulation based on the modification of the LP residual.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{proposed}} some exible methods, which {{are useful in}} the process of voice conversion. The pro-posed methods modify the shape of the vocal tract system and the characteristics of the prosody according to the de-sired requirement. The shape of the vocal tract system is modied by shifting the major resonant frequencies (for-mants) of the short term spectrum, and altering their band-widths accordingly. In the case of prosody modication, the required durational and intonational characteristics are im-posed on the given speech signal. In the proposed method, the prosodic characteristics are manipulated using <b>instants</b> <b>of</b> signicant excitation. The <b>instants</b> <b>of</b> signicant excita-tion correspond to the <b>instants</b> <b>of</b> glottal closure (epochs) in the case of voiced speech, and to some random excita-tions like onset of burst in the case <b>of</b> nonvoiced speech. <b>Instants</b> <b>of</b> signicant excitation are computed from the Lin-ear Prediction (LP) residual of the speech signals by using the property of average group delay of minimum phase sig-nals.
