40|$|AbstractWe {{present results}} from forward geochemical modelling, coupled to fluid flow, of CO 2 {{injection}} in a depleted gas {{field in the}} UK sector of the North Sea (a candidate storage site). For the reservoir a long-term porosity decrease after shut-in is predicted. Similarly for the caprock a reduction in porosity is predicted (for the average mineralogical composition), suggesting an increase in containment integrity. We consider the risks posed by local composition variations, {{in the form of}} possibly through-going calcite pathways (prone to dissolution). Our analysis shows that 1) the dissolution process is transport limited; 2) in the region above the <b>gas</b> <b>water</b> <b>contact</b> the transport process is diffusive, resulting in negligible calcite dissolution; 3) in the region below the contact it would take more than 200, 000 years to dissolve a calcite streak through the primary caprock and the resultant flow path would then facilitate the transfer of brine, not continuous phase CO 2. The long timescale emerging from this analysis is not very site specific...|$|E
40|$|A new {{kinetic model}} is {{established}} to investigate into {{the characteristics of}} methane hydrate formation in the porous media. In this model, the hydrate formation is mainly controlled by the mass transfer at the <b>gas</b> <b>water</b> <b>contact</b> area, which is formed between the liquid and the "gas bubbles" in the pores. Six experimental formation runs are carried out in a three-dimensional pressure vessel, the Pilot Scale Hydrate Simulator (PHS). The experimental data for {{four of the six}} runs are correlated with the kinetic model, and the intrinsic reaction rate constant k(0) and the activation energy Delta E-a are determined to be approximately 8. 06 kg/(m(2) Pa s) and 8. 09 x 10 (4) J/mol, respectively. The system pressures, the hydrate formation rates, and the amount of the remaining free methane gas at other conditions are predicted from the obtained k(0) and Delta E-a. Compared with the experimental data from other two runs, the predicted results are in good agreement, which verifies the reliability of the proposed kinetic model for the prediction of methane hydrate formation in porous media. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the hydrate formation is strongly dependent on the kinetic parameters of k(0) and the reduction exponent beta. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|E

40|$|AbstractUpper Paleozoic coal {{measures}} in the Ordos Basin consist of dark mudstone and coal beds and are important source rocks for gas generation. Gas accumulations include coal-bed methane (CBM), tight gas and conventional gas in different structural areas. CBM accumulations are mainly distributed in the marginal area of the Ordos Basin, and are estimated at 3. 5  ×  1012  m 3. Tight gas accumulations exist in the middle part of the Yishan Slope area, previously regarded as the basin-centered gas system and now considered as stratigraphic lithologic gas reservoirs. This paper reviews the characteristics of tight gas accumulations: poor physical properties (porosity <  8 %, permeability <  0. 85  ×  10 − 3  μm 2), abnormal pressure {{and the absence of}} well-defined <b>gas</b> <b>water</b> <b>contacts.</b> CBM is a self-generation and self-reservoir, while gas derived from {{coal measures}} migrates only for a short distance to accumulate in a tight reservoir and is termed near-generation and near-reservoir.

40|$|Porous {{materials}} combining high hydrophobicity, large surface area, as well {{as large}} and uniform pore size are very useful but rare. The nanoporous zeolitic metal azolate framework, RHO-[Zn(eim) (2) ] (MAF- 6, Heim = 2 -ethylimidazole), is an attractive candidate but thought to be unobtainable/unstable. In this work, the supramolecular isomerism of [Zn(eim) (2) ] is thoroughly studied using a rapid solution mixing reaction of [Zn(NH 3) (4) ](OH) (2) and Heim, which enables MAF- 6 with high crystallinity, purity, and thermal/chemical stabilities to be synthesized in large quantity.

40|$|Abstract Background Schistosomiasis {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{parasitic}} diseases in the world in terms of people infected and those at risk. Infection occurs through <b>contact</b> with <b>water</b> contaminated with larval forms of the parasite, which are released by freshwater snails and then penetrate the skin of people. Schistosomiasis infection and human <b>water</b> <b>contact</b> are thus essentially linked, and more knowledge about their relationship will help us to develop appropriate control measures. So far, only few studies have related <b>water</b> <b>contact</b> patterns to infection levels. Methods We have conducted detailed direct <b>water</b> <b>contact</b> observations in a village in Northern Senegal during the first years of a massive Schistosoma mansoni outbreak to determine the role of human <b>water</b> <b>contact</b> in the extent of the epidemic. We quantified <b>water</b> <b>contact</b> activities in terms of frequency and duration, and described how these vary with age and sex.

Results This resulted in over 120, 000 recorded <b>water</b> <b>contacts</b> for 1651 subjects over 175 observation days. Bathing was the main activity, followed by household activities. Frequency and duration of <b>water</b> <b>contact</b> depended on age and sex rather than season. <b>Water</b> <b>contacts</b> peaked in adolescents, women spent almost twice as much time in the water as men, and <b>water</b> <b>contacts</b> were more intense in the afternoon than in the morning, with sex-specific intensity peaks.

40|$|This study {{represents}} a regional {{review of the}} Toro and Imburu Formation aquifers in the fold belt and foreland regions of the Papuan Basin, Papua New Guinea (PNG). This study extends previous Toro aquifer studies in the Papuan Basin (Eisenberg 1993; Eisenberg et al., 1994; Kotaka 1996). A comprehensive data set was assembled containing all currently available well formation fluid pressure, salinity and temperature data. These data were used to calculate hydraulic potential (Hw) values, which were subsequently used to generate a regional potentiometric map for the Toro Sandstone reservoir and semi-regional maps for the Digimu, Hedinia and Iagifu Sandstone reservoirs of the Imburu Formation. The Toro potentiometric surface map generated {{in this study is}} consistent with an extensive hydrodynamic Toro aquifer system existing in the Papuan Basin Fold Belt. The Toro aquifer likely flows northwest to southeast parallel to the fold belt, from the Lavani Valley Toro outcrop (likely recharge region) in the Highlands, through to the Kutubu Complex, potentially via Hides, (possibly Angore) and the Mananda/South East Mananda Fields. The evidence for Toro aquifer hydrodynamic flow is strongest through the Kutubu Complex of fields, with water flow, entering via Agogo and exiting the fold belt, {{at the southern end of}} the Usano Field into the foreland of the basin. However, it should be noted that <b>gas</b> <b>water</b> <b>contacts</b> (GWCs) for Hides and Angore Fields are not yet available. These have been estimated in this study from Hides and Angore gas pressure gradient intersections with water pressure gradients identified from nearby wells (Lavani- 1 and Egele- 1). Therefore it is not currently possible to unequivocally identify a connected Toro aquifer system between Lavani Valley, (possibly Angore) and Hides. Nevertheless, the Lavani Valley-Hides-Mananda/South East Mananda system (LV-H-M/SEM) represents the most likely flow path for a Toro hydrodynamic aquifer model in the fold belt. Evidence for hydrodynamic Toro aquifer flow was identified in the opposite direction, in a southeast to northwest direction, in the South East Hedinia Field. Significant compartmentalisation of the Toro reservoir was identified in several Hinterland Fields and anticline structures (Egele, Angore, Moran, and Paua Fields along with the Kutubu and Makas Anticlines) and in the southeast region of the central fold belt (Gobe/South East Gobe Fields). Likely Toro aquifer flow exit points from fold belt into foreland were identified at the southern end of Usano at Iorogabaui- 1 and at southern end of South East Mananada Field at Libano- 1 involving the Bosavi Lineament. Possible northwest to southeast Toro aquifer flow was identified in the foreland region of the basin from the Stanley Field in the northwest to the sea in the southeast. The Komewu and Darai Fault systems appear to operate as barriers to northeast to southwest Toro aquifer flow in the foreland. Considerably less data were obtained in this study for the Digimu, Hedinia, Iagifu Sandstone reservoir aquifers compared to the Toro reservoir unit. However, key findings include; (1) for the Digimu Sandstone, hydrostatic and compartmentalised aquifer behaviour in the Agogo, Hedinia/Iagifu and Moran Fields, (2) for the Hedinia Sandstone, hydrodynamic aquifer behaviour in the Hedinia/Iagifu and South East Hedinia Fields and (3) for the Iagifu Sandstone, hydrodynamic aquifer behavior in the Hedinia/Iagifu Fields, a significant Hw step between the Agogo and Hedinia/Iagifu Fields (not seen with any of the other reservoir sandstones) and a compartmentalised aquifer in the Gobe/South East Gobe Fields (where it acts as the main hydrocarbon reservoir). The updated regional data and potentiometric maps generated in this study will assist subregional and field scale modelling of the Toro and Imburu Formation aquifers, future hydrodynamic trapping studies and provide increased confidence for hydrocarbon reserve determination in the Papuan Basin Fields.

This is often the case for water on bare metallic or ceramic surfaces, although the presence of an oxide layer or contaminants on the solid surface can significantly increase the contact angle. Generally, if the <b>water</b> <b>contact</b> angle is smaller than 90°, the solid surface is considered hydrophilic and if the <b>water</b> <b>contact</b> angle is larger than 90°, the solid surface is considered hydrophobic. Many polymers exhibit hydrophobic surfaces. Highly hydrophobic surfaces made of low surface energy (e.g. fluorinated) materials may have <b>water</b> <b>contact</b> angles as high as ~120°. Some materials with highly rough surfaces may have a <b>water</b> <b>contact</b> angle even greater than 150°, due to the presence of air pockets under the liquid drop. These are called superhydrophobic surfaces.|$|R
40|$|Associations between socio-demographic factors, <b>water</b> <b>contact</b> {{patterns}} and Schistosoma mansoni infection were investigated in 506 individuals (87 % of inhabitants {{over 1 year}} of age) in an endemic area in Brazil (Divino), aiming at determining priorities for public health measures to prevent the infection. Those who eliminated S. mansoni eggs (n = 198) were compared to those without eggs in the stools (n = 308). The following explanatory variables were considered: age, sex, color, previous treatment with schistosomicide, place of birth, quality of the houses, water supply for the household, distance from houses to stream, and frequency and reasons for <b>water</b> <b>contact.</b> Factors found to be independently associated with the infection were age (10 - 19 and > 20 yrs old), and <b>water</b> <b>contact</b> for agricultural activities, fishing, and swimming or bathing (Adjusted relative odds = 5. 0, 2. 4, 3. 2, 2. 1 and 2. 0, respectively). This suggests the need for public health measures to prevent the infection, emphasizing <b>water</b> <b>contact</b> for leisure and agricultural activities in this endemic area...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{the use of}} electrophoretic {{deposition}} to modify the surface of Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy fabricated via additive manufacturing technology is reported. Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) -stabilized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) had a spherical shape with a diameter of the metallic core of 100 ± 20 nm and [zeta] -potential - 15 mV. The AgNPs- coated Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy was studied in respect with its chemical composition and surface morphology, <b>water</b> <b>contact</b> angle, hysteresis, and surface free energy. The results of SEM microphotography analysis showed that the AgNPs were homogeneously distributed over the surface. Hysteresis and <b>water</b> <b>contact</b> angle measurements revealed {{the effect of the}} deposited AgNPs layer, namely an increased <b>water</b> <b>contact</b> angle and decreased contact angle hysteresis. However, the average <b>water</b> <b>contact</b> angle was 125 ° for PVP-stabilized-AgNPs-coated surface, whereas ethylene glycol gave the average contact angle of 17 °. A higher surface energy is observed for AgNPs-coated Ti 6 Al 4 V surface (70. 17 mN/m) compared with the uncoated surface (49. 07 mN/m) ...|$|R
