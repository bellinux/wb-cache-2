Of the practice of grouping all the violins together on the left, he wrote, [...] "The new seating is, I admit, easier for the conductor and the second violins, but <b>I</b> <b>firmly</b> maintain that the second violins themselves sound far better on the right.... When the new fashion reached us from America somewhere about 1908 it was adopted by some conductors, but Richter, Weingartner, Walter, Toscanini and many others kept what I feel is the right balance." ...|$|E

National Chief of the AFN, Phil Fontaine, said the package was meant to cover [...] "decades in time, innumerable events and countless injuries to First Nations individuals and communities". Justice Minister Irwin Cotler applauded the compensation decision noting that the placement of children in the residential school system was [...] "the single most harmful, disgraceful and racist act in our history". At an Ottawa news conference, Deputy Prime Minister Anne McLellan said: [...] "We have made good on our shared resolve to deliver what <b>I</b> <b>firmly</b> believe will be a fair and lasting resolution of the Indian school legacy." ...|$|E

A number of prominent scholars have attempted to bring the Zhuangzi to wider attention among Western readers. [...] In 1939, the British translator and Sinologist Arthur Waley described the Zhuangzi as [...] "one of the most entertaining {{as well as one}} of the profoundest books in the world." [...] In the introduction to his 1994 translation of the Zhuangzi, the American Sinologist Victor H. Mair wrote: [...] "I feel a sense of injustice that the Dao De Jing is so well known to my fellow citizens while the Zhuangzi is so thoroughly ignored, because <b>I</b> <b>firmly</b> believe that the latter is in every respect a superior work." ...|$|E
500|$|It was a {{night of}} {{contrasting}} emotions at Home Park. A 2–0 win for the visitors confirmed Argyle's relegation to League One and Newcastle's promotion back to the Premier League as champions at the first attempt. Hours after the match, the club's board declared that it remained determined to steer {{it to the top}} flight of English football. Paul Mariner reaffirmed his commitment to the club, vowing to put things right. [...] "I feel the pain of the supporters because this is the club that gave me my first start," [...] he said. [...] "The reason I came here was because of the vision that the club can get into the Premiership. Now we've got another couple of hurdles before we do that but <b>I</b> <b>firmly</b> believe that we can do it." [...] Argyle's penultimate game of the season took place at the City Ground against Nottingham Forest, who had already qualified for the play-off's, and they secured a comfortable 3–0 victory against the relegated side. The club signed off their campaign with another home defeat against Peterborough United on 2 May. Argyle took the lead in the first-half from a fine individual goal from Wright-Phillips but conceded two goals after the break to Craig Mackail-Smith. Four days later, the club announced that they would be searching for a new manager, with Paul Mariner reverting to his original role as head coach. He said: [...] "I am disappointed that we could not produce the results we wanted last season. I am a realist and understand why and how the board came to the conclusion they have done. I am committed to this club and want only to help it regain Championship status as soon as possible and build on that." [...] Work on a new state-of-the-art Fibrelastic pitch at Home Park began the following week.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1932, Copeland {{made her}} maiden speech on import duties, which she {{approached}} [...] "entirely {{from the point}} of view of the pottery industry". It was an industry under threat from foreign competition and she welcomed the protection that tariffs afforded. She believed that overseas manufacturers paid starvation wages to their workers, and it was with a critical eye on the opposition benches that she asked:"Can we allow goods manufactured under those conditions to come into this country and lower the standard of living of our own people?

To Dines, the ejaculate on the female performer's body [...] "marks the woman as used goods", conveying a sense of ownership, and she quotes veteran porn actor and producer Bill Margold as saying, [...] "I'd like to really show what I believe the men want to see: violence against women. <b>I</b> <b>firmly</b> believe that we serve a purpose by showing that. The most violent we can get is the cum shot in the face. Men get off behind that because they get even with the women they can't have."

Some of the best teams in the country find it impossible to use the pass owing to lack of players who can make it. ... Since {{it is impossible to}} grow larger hands and it is possible to make the ball conform to human dimensions, why not make the ball fit the needed conditions? ...

2500|$|Mutual aid was a {{foundation}} of social welfare in the United States until the early 20th Century. Early societies not only shared material resources, but often advanced social values related to self-reliance and moral character. Many fraternal organizations were first organized as mutual aid societies when government {{at the state and}} local level supplemented private aid societies more than the converse of this being true. In 1890, 112,000 American residents lived in private charitable institutions, while only 73,000 resided in public almshouses. Towards the latter part of the nineteenth century, public aid was reduced as it was seen as contributing to sloth and dependency while private aid was judiciously provided with greater checks for reform and recovery. Writing in 1890, Jacob Riis, commenting on the extent of private charity, says: [...] "New York is, <b>I</b> <b>firmly</b> believe, the most charitable city in the world. Nowhere is there so eager a readiness to help ..." ...|$|E

2500|$|On the fortieth {{anniversary of}} Japan's surrender, 15 August 1985, Nakasone and his Cabinet visited the Yasukuni Shrine in full morning dress. This had great {{symbolic}} significance as {{he visited the}} shrine in his official capacity and demonstrated that the Japanese government was reasserting its respect for {{the spirits of the}} ancestors killed in battle, including those who died in World War II. This was a controversial move and was criticised by the Chinese Communist Party's People's Daily. It was also attacked by opponents at home for violating the Constitution's separation of religion and state. Nakasone defended his actions by saying, [...] "The true defence of Japan... becomes possible only through the combination of liberty-loving peoples who are equal to each other... The manner is desired to be based on self-determination of the race". He also said, [...] "It is considered progressive to criticise pre-war Japan for its faults and defects, but <b>I</b> <b>firmly</b> oppose such a notion. A nation is still a nation whether it wins or loses a war".|$|E
2500|$|The {{industry}} {{reaction was}} somewhat different. The news {{coincided with the}} end of the NFU conference where NFU president Peter Kendall, Agriculture Minister Jim Paice and food critic Jay Rayner were among those defending the concept of large scale farming. The news was greeted with concern that the dairy industry would find it hard to meet future challenges if it could not evolve and develop. [...] Mansel Raymond, chair of the NFU's dairy board, said: [...] "It is disappointing that the application has been withdrawn. Any planned investment in the dairy industry is a positive step. Nocton was an imaginative and innovative proposal, and <b>I</b> <b>firmly</b> believe that there remains a place in Britain for this type of investment if we are to meet the growing demand for food.” The Royal Association of British Dairy Farmers also expressed its disappointment at the withdrawal. The British Cattle Veterinary Association, which leads the industry in managing the health and welfare of dairy cows in the UK, also took the steps of dismissing claims that Nocton Dairies would have been a [...] "cow prison", saying its developers demonstrated a commitment to good welfare.|$|E

And have we now forgotten that powerful friend? or do we imagine that we no longer need His assistance. I have lived, Sir, a long time and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth—that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the sacred writings that [...] "except the Lord build they labor in vain that build it."

2500|$|The Indians {{always insisted}} that they took no prisoners. If they did—a thing <b>I</b> <b>firmly</b> believe—they were {{tortured}} and killed {{the night of the}} 25th.

Wallace {{on the morning of the}} 27th... I'm sorely afraid, Tony, that we will have to class Hayward's story, like that of so many others, as pure, unadulterated B. S.

And it's also Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty's final extravagant howl of self disgust, defiance and contempt for a music world gone foul and corrupt." [...] Many of the KLF's friends and collaborators gave their reactions in the magazine. Movie director Bill Butt said that [...] "Like everything, they're dealing with it in a very realistic way, a fresh, unbitter way, which is very often not the case. A lot of bands disappear with such a terrible loss of dignity". Scott Piering said that [...] "They've got a huge buzz off this, that's for sure, because it's something that's finally thrilling. It's scary to have thrown away a fortune which I know they have. Just the idea of starting over is exciting. Starting over on what? Well, they have such great ideas, like buying submarines". Even Kenny Gates, who as a director of the KLF's distributors APT stood to lose financially from the move, called it [...] "Conceptually and philosophically... absolutely brilliant". Mark Stent reported the doubts of many when he said that [...] "I [...] had so many people who I know, heads of record companies, A men saying, 'Come on, It's a big scam.' But <b>I</b> <b>firmly</b> believe it's over". [...] "For the very last spectacularly insane time", the magazine concluded, [...] "The KLF have done what was least expected of them".|$|E
2500|$|Hayashi's {{first task}} as the Superintendent-General was {{to lay down}} a new {{mind-set}} for the NPR, since the [...] "spiritual training" [...] (seishin kyoiku) in the prewar Imperial Japanese Army had been scrapped. Although the post-war forces were no longer be required to pledge absolute allegiance to the Emperor under the post-war [...] "Peace Constitution", the general public was still unfamiliar with the democracy concept that was newly introduced to them and therefore, {{it was difficult to}} follow the practice of the US to inject democracy concept into the fundamental mind-set of the NPR. As the senior management of the NPR was deeply anxious about the lack of a new and appropriate mind-set, Hayashi attempted to explore one by striking a balance between old and new concepts. The new mind-set was finally introduced in a speech he made in March 1951, in which he emphasized, [...] "The fundamental spirit of the NPR <b>I</b> <b>firmly</b> hold [...] patriotism and love of our race". He pointed out that the NPR was loyal to the country and the people, instead of the Emperor. In another speech to the officers of the NPR, he said, [...] "Needless to say, if this organization is to play its rightful role in the new Japan, it must be ‘an organization of the people.’ This must be the fundamental principle upon which this defense force should be established" [...] By formulating the new mind-set, he connected the new post-war defense force with the people and cut-off its lineage with the prewar Japanese armed forces.|$|E
