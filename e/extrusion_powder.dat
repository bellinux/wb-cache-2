30|$|Recent work using rapid {{prototyping}} {{has demonstrated that}} 3 D printing offers flexibility in design at a reduced cost in comparison with traditional phantoms [10]. Commercially available printers are generally based on three main techniques: thermoplastic <b>extrusion,</b> <b>powder</b> deposition and stereolithography. Thermoplastic deposition uses a heated nozzle to extrude small beads of thermoplastic material. As the material hardens, new layers are built up to create a 3 D object. This method is employed in low-cost printers but lacks the resolution and flexibility {{of some of the}} other techniques. Powder deposition printers apply thin layers of binding material on the printer tray and then coat this with a thin layer of powder. This process is repeated to build up the powder/binder layers to create a 3 D object. This technique generally offers higher resolution than the extrusion technique. However, the final material is brittle and porous, requiring additional sealing for long-term use. Stereolithography-based printers employ a vat of light-curable resin and a laser light to build parts. The laser beam traces a cross section of the object {{on the surface of the}} liquid resin. Exposure to the laser light solidifies the pattern and joins it to the layer below, the resolution achievable is of the order of a few microns and the final build material is more durable than other 3 D printing techniques. These printers are now used for final production parts and can produce fine-resolution structures on a sufficient scale to create bespoke molecular imaging test objects.|$|E

40|$|Additive {{technologies}} have {{given birth to}} an expanding industry now worth 5. 1 billion dollars. It has been adopted widely in design and prototyping as well as manufacturing fields. Compared to conventional technologies, additive manufacturing technologies provides opportunity to print unique complex-shaped geometries. However, it also suffers from slow production rate and high energy consumption. Improving the rate and energy becomes an important issue to make additive manufacturing competitive with conventional technologies. Among all the different limiting factors including printing strategy, heat transfer and mechanical movement limitations, heat transfer is the fundamental limiting barrier preventing further improvement the production rate. This thesis looks at the heat transfer mechanisms in material <b>extrusion</b> and <b>powder</b> bed fusion processes. In all the models developed for these two processes, processing rate is bounded by an adiabatic rate limit at which all the input energy is perfectly utilized to heat up the material to its molten/flowable state. In material extrusion, fused deposition technology suffers low throughput due to poor conductive heat transfer, big area additive manufacturing technology achieves high throughput by introducing viscous heating {{at the cost of}} resolution. In powder bed fusion, due to the intensive laser heating, the process window is limited to ensure high density material while avoid excessive evaporation. Further study quantifies the inefficiency from heat transfer mechanisms which leads to lower processing rates than the adiabatic rate limit. Energy consumption for material <b>extrusion</b> and <b>powder</b> bed fusion machines are reviewed to evaluate significance of energy consumed to heat up the material. For fused deposition technology, most of the energy is consumed by environment heating; while for powder bed fusion technology, laser unit takes the most energy. Life cycle energy consumption for products made with powder bed fusion process is compared with same/similar parts made from conventional manufacturing processes to explore scenarios in which manufacturing with additive technologies is less energy intensive. by Sheng Jiang.

The magnitude of Ï 0 is also strongly affected by the powder particle diameter, directly associated with the grain size: the larger the grain size, the lower the threshold stress.
