Shortly after this, Wycombe triggered a one–year extension clause in his contract, subsequently keeping him at the club until 2010.

2500|$|Reinhardt {{recorded}} over 900 {{sides in}} his recording career, from 1928 to 1953, the majority as {{sides of the}} then-prevalent 78-RPM records, with the remainder as acetates, transcription discs, private and off-air recordings (of radio broadcasts), {{and part of a}} film soundtrack. Only one session (eight tracks) from March 1953 was ever recorded specifically for album release by Norman Granz in the then-new LP format, but Reinhardt died before the album could be released. In his earliest recordings Reinhardt played banjo (or, more accurately, banjo-guitar) accompanying accordionists and singers on dances and popular tunes of the day, with no jazz content, whereas in the last recordings before his death he played amplified guitar in the bebop idiom with a pool of younger, more modern French musicians. A full chronological listing of his lifetime recorded output is available from the source cited here, and an index of individual tunes is available from the source cited <b>here.</b> <b>A</b> <b>few</b> fragments of film performance (without original sound) also survive, as does one complete performance with sound, of the tune [...] "J'Attendrai" [...] performed with the Quintet in 1938 for the short film Le Jazz Hot.|$|E
