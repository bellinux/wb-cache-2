50|$|The {{component}} of this mammoth project (PIPC) was first initiated {{with the development}} of the Pengerang Deepwater Terminal or PDT, a joint-venture between Dialog Group, Royal Vopak of the Netherlands and the State of Johor. Serving as a centralised storage facility for trading, refining and petrochemical industry, the Deepwater Terminal is envisioned to have a storage capacity of 5 million cubic meters. The USD3 billion facility includes an independent terminal for trading, a dedicated <b>industrial</b> <b>terminal</b> for investors within PIPC, and a Liquefied Natural Gas Terminal. The construction of a deepwater jetty facility with natural water depth would enable the berthing of both ultra large crude carriers and very large crude carriers. PDT received its first shipment of oil {{in the first quarter of}} 2014 and continues to cater to the growing demand for its services.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{designed}} an Au 1000 {{processor board}} after successfully completing the software development and trials for a remote barcode reader. The miscellaneous {{pieces of paper}} were resurrected {{as part of our}} documentation efforts to create LATEX classes. The documentation of the various Au 1000 evaluation boards and related soft-ware projects on our website were grouped in this PDF (Portable Document Format) file, with lower resolution photographs for downloading. The original circuit diagrams were generated in OrCAD in 2002 and were bound as a hard copy. We no longer maintain the layout- or schematic capture tools, so inserting the design as a PDF document will have to wait until we download a free reader or evaluation copy.

50|$|The {{manufacture}} of naval stores and lumbering {{were the first}} marketable enterprises for the families inhabiting what is now Limestone Creek Township. These commodities were ferried down the Northeast Cape Fear River (which, {{in the early nineteenth}} century, had been made navigable) to Wilmington. As demand for naval stores fell, however, the cultivation of corn and, most importantly, tobacco moved to the forefront.

40|$|Many {{terminals}} {{are used}} in safety-critical operations in which humans, through terminal user interfaces, {{become a part of}} the system control loop (e. g., medical and <b>industrial</b> systems). These <b>terminals</b> are typically embedded, single-purpose devices with restricted functionality, sometimes air-gapped and increasingly hardened. We describe a new way of attacking such terminals in which an adversary has only temporary, non-invasive, physical access to the terminal. In this attack, the adversary attaches a small device to the interface that connects user input peripherals to the terminal. The device executes the attack when the authorized user is performing safety-critical operations, by modifying or blocking user input, or injecting new input events. Given that the attacker has access to user input, the execution of this attack might seem trivial. However, to succeed, the attacker needs to overcome a number of challenges including the inability to directly observe the user interface and avoid being detected by the users. We present techniques that allow user interface state and input tracking. We evaluate these techniques and show that they can be implemented efficiently. We further evaluate the effectiveness of our attack through an online user study and find input modification attacks that are hard for the users to detect and would therefore lead to serious violations of the input integrity...|$|R
40|$|Fugitive dust emissions, {{from coal}} and iron ore storage and {{handling}} {{sites in the}} port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, cause nuisance in residential areas due to dust deposition, {{and add to the}} PM 10 ambient concentration. PM 10 concentrations fluctuate around the EU limit value and emission reductions play an important role both in safeguarding air quality and in assuring environmental “space ” for future developments in the port <b>industrial</b> area.

40|$|The {{transition}} from deindustrial to post industrial city from the 1970 s exposed how cities developed regeneration strategies as their traditional <b>industrial</b> base experienced <b>terminal</b> contraction. These strategies to re-make urban places positioned at their core an {{improvement of the}} built environment either by retaining and adapting or demolishing and replacing historic buildings. Decisions to re-use or demolish revealed the contemporary valorisations of the past as they mediated {{the extent to which}} the reinvention of the city embraced or denied the cumulative memories of the city. Unravelling these decisions revealed the process of urban change by exposing the management of urban regeneration, the actors and agencies involved, their motives, constraints and failings and their ability to access funding. How these actors valued, perceived, and subsequently received the cityscape was revealed by their decisions whether or not to incorporate the historic environment in their vision for the city. Moreover, how public and private agencies such as local authorities, government quangos, and entrepreneurs manipulated the existing capital stock to attract people and investment into the inner cities was a vital component of urban regeneration. Four stages of re-making places: recognising place, managing urban change, seducing urban users, and manipulating the historic environment that each exposed the contemporary valuations of the past were identified and were explored through an examination of two British and one French urban centre. By these means, and using these examples, the research located the practice of restoration and re-use in the context of place-making and value judgements to question {{the extent to which the}}re was a contemporary place for urban history.

40|$|The {{course of}} the river, the {{topography}} of the valley and the river regime are determinants of spatial composition of the city, as well as development {{and nature of the}} city’s structure (eg building on river terraces, no or temporary constructions on floodplains etc.). Second important factor shaping the spatial and functional arrangement of cities located on rivers is the accessibility to waters. Analyzing the land use plans of chosen Baltic riverside port cities (Lübeck [9], Szczecin [10], Gdańsk [11]) one could distinguish two or three functional zones (I, II, III.) existing along the river. The first two zones are closed and are not accessible to the public. The first zone (I) is created by spatial objects whose function enforces the waterside location. These are usually: the port <b>terminals,</b> <b>industrial</b> plants, and energy plants, which have to use raw materials and intermediate products delivered by water transport. Mostly, zone I is continuous, and is interrupted only by transport passageways (arterial road, tracks), river crossings (bridgeheads, check ferry), or infrastructure objects (e. g. wastewater treatment plant). If zone I is divided into particular sections, it is usually greenery which separates them. Residential development located directly {{on the banks of the}} river is relatively rare outside the downtown. Zone II is designed to support or to co-operate with the first zone. It usually consist of back-up infrastructure (eg energy facilities, water supply facilities, machine base), transport-logistics objects (such as logistic centers, railway sidings, parking lots for a truck route, container depot etc.) and industrial objects (eg factories providing services for freight).

40|$|Train {{travel was}} once {{integral}} to the urban condition. Railway stations and rural depots were designed as machines for efficiency and it was within the station that one could escape {{the chaos of the}} city {{to become a part of}} the streamlined systematization of the <b>industrial</b> age. The <b>terminal,</b> it was thought, existed as an extension of the infrastructure of the railroad and as an integral part of the metropolitan corridor. As such, the architecture of the station re sided within the two dimensional network ascribed to the city and to the Western and Midwestern landscape. This thesis explores the amplification of a static rail station typology into a dynamic and multifaceted urban organism that is activated in its integration of multiple infrastructures operating at multiple speeds of travel [...] from airplane to high-speed train to subway to bus to car to pedestrian. Its mediation of multiple notions of arrival and departure results in a public space highly charged with activity; it is a connector, a facilitator, a non-place. The station program includes access to three underground subway lines (one proposed), on-grade bus connections, a secure high-speed airport train with baggage and ticket check-in, a portion of the pedestrian walkway which snakes underground through Chicago's loop, and a connection to the elevated rail. The exterior poche of the station building houses theaters and restaurants, shops, bars, and a hotel. Within this urban program hunkers a secure zone- waiting rooms and restaurants, newspaper kiosks and conference rooms linked hermetically to the secure airport connector train and ultimately to O'Hare Airport's gates. by Amanda Dickson.

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this article is to explore whether {{applying}} differentiation/segmentation in access management has potential to increase resource efficiency in intermodal freight transportation. Research Approach The methodology is divided into four phases: The first two, to define access management and differentiation/segmentation, are based on literature studies. The third one contains the data collection methods. The operations of six trucks were studied, and their time management activities were measured for one week. During the study, the truck drivers were interviewed in semi-structured interviews, and participant observations were conducted and registered. Additionally, focus group meetings were conducted (independent of the other methods) to obtain expert knowledge and input from <b>industrial</b> stakeholders (hauliers, <b>terminals,</b> and IT-suppliers) regarding the required information for improving the interaction between the involved actors. The fourth phase, analysis and conclusions, is proposal development of potential strategies for improving access management. The objects under study were two road-based freight companies, one port authority and one intermodal terminal. Findings and Originality The main finding consists of a proposal for potential strategies for improving access management. They were developed through the study literature and examining empirical findings that indicated sources of inefficiencies in the studied system. Additionally, the potential strategies are depending on the type of hub (intermodal terminal or port) and whether it imports or exports containers. Furthermore, these potential strategies also consider the informational content required to make these recommendations and how it should be exchanged between the involved hauliers and hubs. The main uniqueness of this study stems from the joint efforts of academic and industry stakeholders in developing this strategy based on real-life measurements and their own experiences and expertise. Research Impact By employing both literature studies and empirical data collection methods to develop the proposed strategy, this work has increased the understanding and knowledge about the goods and information flows to and from two hubs, including identified sources of inefficiencies. Practical Impact This study has provided the decisions makers at the studied organisations with new insights regarding the sources of inefficiencies that are present when accessing a hub and ways to potential decrease the identified inefficiencies...|$|R
40|$|Three {{decades have}} passed since {{milestone}} publications by several industrial and academic researchers spawned a flurry of research and commercial, industrial activities on model predictive control (MPC). The improvement in efficiency of the on-line optimization part of MPC led to its adoption in mechanical and mechatronic systems from process control and petrochemical applications. However, the massive strides made by the academic community in guaranteeing stability through state-space MPC {{have not always been}} directly applicable in an industrial setting. This thesis is concerned with design and a posteriori certification of feasibility/stability of input-output MPC controllers for <b>industrial</b> applications without <b>terminal</b> conditions (i. e. terminal penalty, terminal constraint, terminal control). MPC controllers which differ in their modelling and prediction method are categorized into three major groups, and a general equivalence between these forms is established. Then an overview on robust set invariance is given as it plays a fundamental role in our analysis of the constrained control systems. These tools are used to give new tuning guidelines as well as a posteriori tests for guaranteeing feasibility of the suboptimal or optimal predictive control law without terminal conditions, which is fundamental towards stability of the closed loop. Next, penalty adaptation is used as a systematic procedure to derive asymptotic stability without any terminal conditions and without using set invariance or Lyapunov arguments. This analysis however is restricted to repetitive systems with input constraints. Then, predictive control without terminal conditions is considered for nonlinear and distributed systems. The invariance tools are extended to switching nonlinear systems, a proof of convergence is given for the iterative nonlinear MPC (NMPC), and a guarantee on overall cost decrease is developed for distributed NMPC, all without terminal conditions. Reference generation and parameter adaptation are shown to be effective mechanisms for NMPC and distributed NMPC (DNMPC) under changing environmental conditions. This is demonstrated on two benchmark test-cases i. e. the wet-clutch and hydrostatic drivetrain, respectively. Terminal conditions in essence are difficult to compute, may compromise performance and are not used in the industry. The main contribution of the thesis is a systematic development and analysis of MPC without terminal conditions for linear, nonlinear and distributed systems.
