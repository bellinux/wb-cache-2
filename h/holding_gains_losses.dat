40|$|Net {{investment}} in inventories {{is one of}} the more volatile components of GDP, giving it an important role in short-run variation in the growth of GDP and in the timing and duration of economic downturns. Its most distinctive feature may, however, be the number of conceptual and practical difficulties that arise in its measurement both in nominal terms and in real terms. Net {{investment in}} inventories is also known as change in inventories (CII). The first part of this paper concerns the measurement of nominal CII at the annual frequency. The principle that the economic value of production is measured at the prices existing when the production occurred means that the definition of nominal CII must keep <b>holding</b> <b>gains</b> and <b>losses</b> on inventories out of the measure of GDP. Yet, however clear this requirement may be in the realm of theory, it does not translate literally into practice because the data are generally not precise enough to justify complete faith in the raw estimate of <b>holding</b> <b>gains</b> or <b>losses</b> on inventories. If the estimate of <b>holding</b> <b>gains</b> or <b>losses</b> on inventories is large, the implicit price for the annual CII it is likely to be extreme or negative. We wish to avoid the inconvenience that this causes unless we have some assurance that the large estimate is not a result of an unlucky draw of random errors in the underlying data...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reveals how}} the {{financial}} crisis undermined the performance of Private Equity Partnerships (PEPs). The private equity business model depends upon leveraged finance coupled with corporate transformation from market arbitrage that, in turn, delivers inflated market valuations and exit multiples. Private equity partnerships conjoin corporate productive and financial activity with speculative capital market demands where liquidity, risk appetite and market value appreciation matter. It is a business model where productive transformation of acquired firm???s is often disappointing because leverage inflates balance sheet capitalization ahead of cash earnings capacity. It is also a volatile business model because capital market valuations and fair value reporting amplify <b>holding</b> <b>gains</b> and <b>losses</b> for limited equity partners. It is a business model constructed on shifting sands not terra firma...|$|R
40|$|A brief {{discussion}} of the current views on fair value accounting is followed by reviewing the concerns raised by the critics. These concerns are related to (a) reliability and verifiability of the underlying assumptions {{in the case of}} mark to model, and (b) the recognition of large losses when prices decline. My concerns about fair value accounting rest on three different issues: (1) the potential for redistribution of capital as dividends when cash dividends exceed realized earnings; (2) reporting failure as success, and success as a failure when increasing credit risk of debtors allows them to recognize gains and vice versa, and (3) increasing information asymmetry when combining realized and unrealized <b>gains</b> and <b>losses</b> as well as failing to disclose the drivers of <b>holding</b> <b>gains</b> and <b>losses.</b> These problems with fair value accounting do not necessarily mean that we should abandon fair value accounting. Instead, the proposal is made to produce two sets of financial statements: one based on historical cost and the other based on fair value. Each type serves a different purpose. Mixing and blending historical costs and fair values is problematic in that it worsens transparency and enhances information asymmetry...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the field}} of Accounting, {{financial}} statements prepared using the acquisition cost so that expresses the state of a company, have been made into a serious problem. Then, the concern of many people has been increased in the accounting information using fair value or market price. If such measurement is performed, profits containing an unrealized <b>holding</b> <b>gain</b> will pose a serious problem. And {{the definition of a}} different income account from a conventional income statement poses a problem. I want to position a statement of comprehensive income in this consideration, which is constructed from a viewpoint of semiology, leaving for the former view point standing a different accounting theory. Furthermore, I want to also mention the problem of recycling, relating a realization basis. As a result of these considerations, it became clear that a statement of comprehensive income is the financial statement which reports that income, which is the expanded conventional concept, including the unrealized <b>holding</b> <b>gain</b> and <b>loss</b> concepts in addition to the traditional revenue and expense concepts. And, it becomes clear that a statement of comprehensive income organically related with the other accounts or financial statements, by preparing the comprehensive income and loss account, which expanded the expense and revenue summary account. Furthermore, we {{want to point out that}} many problems arise, when the recycling of the comprehensive income is carried out...|$|R

This implies that utility U of joint receipt is either itself additive or is an exponential transformation of an additive representation V. For joint receipt of mixed <b>gains</b> and <b>losses</b> two hypotheses are discussed: either U or V is additive over mixed joint receipts. Both hypotheses are linked back to gambles in two different ways: a generalization of segregation and an empirically sustained but nonrational property called duplex decomposition. The additive U model yields bilinear expressions like rank-dependent expected utility. Data favor the latter. The additive V models yield nonbilinear representations of mixed gambles...|$|R

40|$|In {{a recent}} issue of this journal, Argiles and Slof (2001) {{analysed}} the main features of the European Farm Accountancy Database Network (FADN) against the backdrop of IAS 41, the new international accounting standard on agriculture, and arrived at the conclusion that FADN offers an excellent tool for operationalizing IAS 41 in European farms. The present study revisits some of the key issues in Argiles and Slof's paper in a wider international context and highlights their implications for the harmonization of farm accounting practices around the world. In particular, this paper contends that there are some key provisions of IAS 41 that are incompatible with the European Union Fourth Directive which Argiles and Slof (2001, p. 364) apparently overlooked by focusing only on aspects of the directive that sanction current value measurement and ignoring those that relate to the treatment of associated <b>holding</b> <b>gains</b> or <b>losses.</b> Furthermore, this paper also demonstrates that Argiles and Slof's argument that simplicity is another improvement of IAS 41 vis-a-vis the French Plan Comptable General Agricole is flawed. Indeed, it is shown here that it would be virtually impossible to implement IAS 41 in Francophone countries {{in the absence of a}} fundamental revision, if not complete abandonment, of the plan comptable, at least in view of major conceptual differences between the notions of income, production and value added espoused by national statisticians and those enshrined in IAS 41. ...|$|R
40|$|In January 2005 the Canadian Accounting Standards Board (AcSB) issued {{three new}} {{accounting}} standards that require Canadian firms to mark-to-market certain financial {{assets and liabilities}} and recognize the <b>holding</b> <b>gains</b> and <b>losses</b> related to these items as other comprehensive income {{or as part of}} net income. The Board's objectives for issuing the new standards are (i) to harmonize Canadian GAAP with US and International GAAP, (ii) to enhance the transparency and usefulness of financial statements, and (iii) to keep pace with changes in accounting standards in other countries that are moving towards fair value accounting. This paper investigates empirically whether requiring Canadian companies to report comprehensive income and its components provides the securities market with incremental value-relevant information over the traditional historical-cost earnings approach. Previous empirical studies provide mixed evidence on the value relevance of other comprehensive income and its components. This mixed evidence may be attributed partially to the use of as if methodology to construct an ex-ante measure of other comprehensive income prior to the implementation of SFAS 130, which introduces measurement error. In contrast, this study uses actual data on other comprehensive income for a sample of Canadian firms cross-listed in the US in the period 1998 - 2003. We find evidence that available-for-sale and cash flow hedges components are significantly associated with price and market returns. We also find that aggregate comprehensive income is more strongly associated (in terms of explanatory power) with both stock price and returns compared to net income. However, we find that net income is a better predictor of future net income relative to comprehensive income. Our findings suggest that mandating all Canadian firms to adopt the new accounting standards is expected to enhance the usefulness of financial statements. Our findings, therefore, should be of interest to Canadian accounting policy makers as they provide ex-ante evidence on the potential usefulness of mandating firms to report comprehensive income and the components of other comprehensive income in their financial statements.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{evidence that}} social interaction {{contributes to the}} disposition ef-fect. I analyze a unique database drawn from a social network for retail traders. Participating in the social network requires an agreement between the social network and a trader’s brokerage. The introduction of roughly fifty retail-specific brokerages into the social networking environment was staggered over time, which provides an op-portunity to causally identify the impact of social interaction. Traders are almost twice as susceptible to the disposition effect after entering the social network. Relative {{to the formation of}} a simulated network, traders who are similarly prone to the disposition effect tend to form friendships with one another, which suggests a feedback effect. A number of alternative theories – adverse selection, transaction costs, blame delegation, learning, and a belief in mean-reversion – while valid on their own, are unlikely to explain the detrimental impact of social influence. The social network increases (has little effect on) the propensity to <b>hold</b> onto <b>losses</b> (<b>gains),</b> which supports the simplest explanation for the disposition effect: individuals are loss-averse, and it can be eve...|$|R

40|$|The modules of the LHCb Outer Tracker {{have shown}} {{to suffer from}} <b>gain</b> <b>loss</b> under {{irradiation}} at moderate intensities, {{a process known as}} ageing. The plastifier in the glue with which the detector modules were constructed, Araldite AY 103 - 1, {{has been shown to be}} the culprit. In this thesis this is confirmed by irradiating a module constructed with Araldite AY 105 - 1, which does not contain the harmful plastifier. Several methods to prevent and repair the <b>gain</b> <b>loss</b> exist. One preventive measure is the addition of oxygen. However, because of its electronegative nature, oxygen can capture some of the drifting electrons, thereby lowering the gain of the OT. Simulations have been done to investigate the effect of oxygen on the gain and efficiency. One method to remove the ageing is HV training. In this procedure the applied voltage is increased such, that the OT enters the discharge regime. These discharges mostly remove the ageing, but can take place anywhere in the straw tube, not necessarily at the location of the ageing. Curing the module while putting a source near the location of the ageing is shown to always cure the <b>gain</b> <b>loss.</b> Finally, a method has been devised to quantify the amount of <b>gain</b> <b>loss</b> in the OT with the standard OT readout electronics.
