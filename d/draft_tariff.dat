After two terms, {{he was elected to}} the United States House of Representatives, where he served three terms. There he was noted for championing Native and African-American rights. His opposition to patronage and his support for a protective tariff helped secure his appointment to the Ways and Means Committee headed by William McKinley, where he helped <b>draft</b> the <b>Tariff</b> Act of 1890 (McKinley Tariff).|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{numbering}} plan, PBX, <b>tariffs,</b> <b>draft</b> disable <b>tariff</b> system and its possible extensions. Within numbering plans work deals with shapes of national and international figures, describes different types of these numbers, description of the structure and definition of fields, including the length of these fields. Within countries and regions of the Czech Republic are given individual prefix for both fixed and mobile networks. There are mentioned special shapes that are different in length compared to standard types. All these types of shapes are listed according to ITU-T. Within the exchanges are given generation switches, PBXs use within the telephone network and {{a description of the}} selected functions. Furthermore, there are kinds of pricing and options of valuation call. The work contains a description of automated acconting system, according to the principle of work of the program and a description of the individual steps and functions that thanks to the cooperation process individually each calls, convert numbers to international form, assigns the call tariff and appreciate the call according to the tariff. Finally, there are described possible extensions of this automated acconting system...|$|R
5000|$|The tariff was {{not well}} {{received}} by Americans who suffered a steep increase {{in the cost of}} products. In the 1890 election Republicans lost their majority in the House with the number of seats they won reduced by nearly half, from 171 to 88. [...] In the 1892 presidential election, Harrison was soundly defeated by Grover Cleveland, and the Senate, House, and Presidency were all under Democratic control. Lawmakers immediately started <b>drafting</b> new <b>tariff</b> legislation, and in 1894 the Wilson-Gorman Tariff passed which lowered US tariff averages. Nor was the tariff well received abroad. Protectionists within the British Empire used the McKinley Tariff to argue for tariff retaliation and imperial trade preference.|$|R

These subsequent bills were primarily revenue driven to meet the war's needs, though they enjoyed the support of protectionists such as Carey, who again assisted Morrill in the bill's <b>drafting.</b> The Morrill <b>Tariff</b> of 1861 was designed to raise revenue. The tariff act of 1862 served not only to raise revenue, but also to encourage the establishment of factories free from British competition by taxing British imports. Furthermore, it protected American factory workers from low paid European workers, and as a major bonus attracted {{tens of thousands of}} those Europeans to immigrate to America for high wage factory and craftsman jobs.|$|R

40|$|China has {{recently}} become a dominant {{player in the}} solar photovoltaic (PV) industry, producing {{more than one-third of}} the global supply of solar cells in 2008. However, as of 2008, less than 1 % of global installations were based in China. Recently, the government has stated its grand ambitions of expanding the share of electricity derived from solar power. As part of this initiative, policy makers are currently in the process of <b>drafting</b> a feed-in <b>tariff</b> policy to support the development of the solar energy market. In this paper, we aim to calculate what the level of such a tariff should be. We develop a closed form equation for the cost of PV, and use forecasts on prices of solar systems to derive an optimal feed-in tariff, including a digression rate. The focus is on the potential of residential and small scale commercial solar PV installations. We show that the cost of small scale PV in China has decreased rapidly during the period 2005 - 2009. Our analysis also shows that optimal feed-in tariffs vary widely between regions within China, and that grid parity could be reached in large parts of the country depending on the expected escalation in electricity prices.
