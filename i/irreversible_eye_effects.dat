5|$|Under normal conditions, the Sun is {{so bright}} {{that it is}} {{difficult}} to stare at it directly. However, during an eclipse, with so much of the Sun covered, it is easier and more tempting to stare at it. Looking at the Sun during an eclipse is as dangerous as looking at it outside an eclipse, except during the brief period of totality, when the Sun's disk is completely covered (totality occurs only during a total eclipse and only very briefly; it does not occur during a partial or annular eclipse). Viewing the Sun's disk through any kind of optical aid (binoculars, a telescope, or even an optical camera viewfinder) is extremely hazardous and can cause <b>irreversible</b> <b>eye</b> damage within a fraction of a second.|$|R

Another example is a slight smile that David makes after setting one of the villagers on fire in the UK print; the freeze frames of the American print do not contain such subtle detail. This print also has a credit for being filmed at MGM's British studios that {{is not on the}} American prints.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Red <b>eye</b> <b>effect</b> {{is still}} {{a major problem in}} digital {{photography}}. The red <b>eye</b> <b>effect</b> in photography is the common appearance of red pupils in colored photographs. The effect is caused when the camera captures the flash light reflecting from the red blood vessels of the subject pupil. This artifact is more common when the camera lens is close to the photographic flash just like mobile phone. Various new techniques have been developed to remove this artifact. This paper discuss the latest technique which is Support Vector Machine (SVM) in which both the skin region detection as well as the red eye detection is carried out by SVM technique...|$|R

5000|$|In gemology, chatoyancy ( [...] ), or chatoyance or cat's <b>eye</b> <b>effect,</b> is {{an optical}} {{reflectance}} effect seen in certain gemstones. Coined from the French [...] "œil de chat", meaning [...] "cat's eye", chatoyancy arises {{either from the}} fibrous structure of a material, as in tiger's eye quartz, or from fibrous inclusions or cavities within the stone, as in cat's eye chrysoberyl. [...] The precipitates that cause chatoyance in chrysoberyl are the mineral rutile, composed mostly of titanium dioxide. Examined samples have yielded no evidence of tubes or fibres. The rutile precipitates all align perpendicularly with respect to cat's <b>eye</b> <b>effect.</b> It is reasoned that the lattice parameter of the rutile matches {{only one of the}} three orthorhombic crystal axes of the chrysoberyl, resulting in preferred alignment along that direction.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{perception}} of direct gaze—that is, of another individual’s gaze {{directed at the}} observer—is known to influence {{a wide range of}} cognitive processes and behaviors. We present a new theoretical proposal to provide a unified account of these effects. We argue that direct gaze first captures the beholder’s attention and then triggers self-referential processing, i. e., a heightened processing of stimuli in relation with the self. Self-referential processing modulates incoming information processing and leads to the Watching <b>Eyes</b> <b>effects,</b> which we classify into four main categories: the enhancement of self-awareness, memory effects, the activation of pro-social behavior, and positive appraisals of others. We advance that the belief to be the object of another’s attention is embedded in direct gaze perception and gives direct gaze its self-referential power. Finally, we stress that the Watching <b>Eyes</b> <b>effects</b> reflect a positive impact on human cognition; therefore, they may have a therapeutic potential, which future research should delineate...|$|R
40|$|In China, {{the current}} {{situation}} is that people under indirect threat from unprotected lead-zinc mining tends to oppose it, whereas people under direct threat are likely to &# 39;sail close to the wind&# 39;. To understand this puzzle-like phenomenon, we surveyed 220 residents in a lead-zinc mining area located in Fenghuang County of China. We found that: 1) The degree of risk perception of villagers living around the mining site correlated inversely with their degree of involvement in mining risk. We refer to this as the "involvement" version of the psychological typhoon <b>eye</b> <b>effect.</b> 2) Perceived benefit and perceived harm provided a satisfactory explanation for this "involvement" version of the psychological typhoon <b>eye</b> <b>effect.</b> 3) Risk perception was negatively related to support for the relevant policy which we viewed as constituting a sort of voting behavior. The results may have implications for better understanding how benefited individuals respond to environmental health risks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
5000|$|The glowing-eye effect, {{when the}} {{children}} used their mental powers, was achieved by creating animated overlays of a bright white iris; this created a bright glowing iris with a black pupil when optically printed into the film.

The other time David's eyes go from normal to glowing on screen (after one of the girl children is nearly run down by a car), a two shot of the girl and David, is a composite shot split by a slightly jagged black line; the half with the girl is live motion, {{and you can see}} her hair moving in the breeze, whereas the half with David is a freeze frame with the <b>eye</b> <b>effect</b> added.|$|R

40|$|The {{watching}} <b>eyes</b> <b>effect</b> {{has been}} hotly debated in recent years. Interestingly, field studies often reveal strong <b>effects</b> of <b>eye</b> images on {{various forms of}} prosociality. Here, we explored the watching <b>eyes</b> <b>effect</b> on prosociality - in terms of lost letter return rates. We conducted three field experiments, in which we dropped a total of 540 letters in 13 different neighborhoods in the Netherlands (six of high SES and seven of low SES). The envelopes had printed stylized eyes, flowers (or no logo, for Experiments 1 and 2). Combined analysis of all three experiments revealed no significant <b>effect</b> of <b>eye</b> images on lost letter return rates. There was also no interaction between eyes and SES but also no main effect of SES levels on lost letter return rates. Overall, these null results suggest that minimal cues to being watched may not be that powerful in promoting forms of prosociality that entail a certain cost {{and do not have}} obvious benefits for the individual, such as return of lost letters...|$|R

50|$|Translucent {{yellowish}} chatoyant chrysoberyl {{is called}} cymophane or cat's eye. Cymophane has its derivation {{also from the}} Greek words meaning 'wave' and 'appearance', {{in reference to the}} haziness that visually distorts what would normally be viewed as a well defined surface of a cabochon. This effect may be combined with a cat <b>eye</b> <b>effect.</b> In this variety, microscopic tubelike cavities or needle-like inclusions of rutile occur in an orientation parallel to the c-axis, producing a chatoyant effect visible as a single ray of light passing across the crystal. This effect is best seen in gemstones cut in cabochon form perpendicular to the c-axis. The color in yellow chrysoberyl is due to Fe3+ impurities.|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. Eye contact (mutual gaze) {{is among the}} most important signals in human communication and social interaction. Eye contact is known to modulate various aspects of social cognition. Although several theories have been proposed about this 'eye contact effect', these studies do not agree on: the mechanism underlying, the development of, the <b>eye</b> contact <b>effect.</b> The current programme aims to build a coherent model of the <b>eye</b> contact <b>effect</b> by testing different predictions from these theories. The programme consists of: conducting research projects on the mechanism and the development of the <b>eye</b> contact <b>effect,</b> publishing both empirical and theoretical papers, disseminating the research output to, and establishing networks with, national and international communities developing research skills both in experiments and in dissemination. The output of this research programme will be beneficial for the further understanding of the developmental basis of human social communication. It will also help develop user-friendly communication devices that can simulate face-to-face communication, which may be applicable for infants and children with special needs. The fellowship will also allow the acquisition of advanced levels of research, teaching and management skills, which are essential for development as an independent scientist...|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} this {{presentation}} {{is to describe}} in general terms how the California Department of Pesticide Regulation (CDPR) evaluates worker and bystander exposure to the methyl bromide alternative: 1, 3 -dichloropropene (1, 3 -D also known commercially as Telone®). 1, 3 -D is a volatile organic compound (VOC) that has been registered {{for use as a}} pesticide to control symphylans, wire worms and all major types of nematodes since 1954. In 1990, California suspended all use because unacceptably high levels of 1, 3 -D were detected in its air monitoring program. 1, 3 -D use in California was reinstated in 1995 following label changes and mitigation measures aimed at reducing exposures of workers and bystanders. In California reports of illness and injury associated with pesticide products are maintained in the Pesticide Illness Surveillance Program (PISP) at CDPR. This database plus animal studies and the medical literature provide information on the nature of pesticide exposure and subsequent illness or injury. These sources indicate that exposure to 1, 3 -D vapor and liquid leads to <b>irreversible</b> <b>eye</b> damage. Inhalation causes severe irritation of the nasopharynx and lungs and may lead to central nervous system depression, loss of consciousness, and convulsions. Skin contact causes dermatitis and necrosis and leads to persistent sensitization. 1, 3 -D causes tumors in animals. This illness information, coupled with the physical and chemical properties of 1, 3 D, is used to develop criteria for personal protective equipment and other mitigation measures designed to be health protective. California requires reporting of all agricultural pesticides applied by licensed applicators. These data are collected in the Pesticide Use Report (PUR) databas...|$|R
