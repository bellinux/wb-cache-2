Also around 120 B-Eyes by PKG, {{were obtained for}} the tour as well with lighting control from three full-sized grandMA2s and 10 NPUs. According to lighting programmer Jason Baeri, [...] "Bennett's approach to the show was {{to make it an}} immersive rave that reflected Gaga's non-stop party aesthetic... That means active, alive, vibrant and high energy—it requires us to be just as active on stage as in the crowd. The audience is <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> a set piece as they are a room of spectators, so we had to include them as part of Gaga's same party not just watching the spectacle from afar. Cue wise, that's almost like programming two shows at once: Both had to behave as one cohesive element." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Tijana Ilich, {{writing for}} About.com, put Sentimiento at {{number one on}} her list of the Top Reggaetón/Hip Hop Albums of 2007. [...] "Instead of selling the music with skull-crunching decibels, she uses her strong, rich, deep voice to bring <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> force to her songs. Her lyrics are about honest emotions that brim with real life situations." [...] she commented. Ilich found the album interesting [...] "in its turnaround technique of using male guests to sing any song that even smacks of a ballad." [...] She said {{it was interesting to}} see what Queen would be singing about in 2007. She later named Queen one of the ten most influential women in Latin music in the category Reggaetón/Hip-Hop while selecting Sentimiento as Queen's best album, yet. David Jeffies of Allmusic, began his review of the album by noting that with Sentimiento, {{it was the first time}} she entered the Billboard 200, [...] "affirming her considerable popularity, especially in her native land." [...] He claimed that Queen's husky voice [...] "is well-suited to reggaetón's catchy melodies and hard-hitting beats, as evinced on the frenetic lead single [...] "Que Lloren."

[...] GameSpot praised the Virtual Console release as well, especially its graphics, stating, [...] "Visually, the developers made the best of the system's limited color palette and employed every graphical trick they could to make the game look snazzy. Ristar and his enemies have a good variety of animations, but what you'll probably notice the most are the colorful, multilayered backgrounds that constantly flaunt animated details in the form of moving clouds, falling debris, and rampaging creatures that have a habit of hurling things at you from a distance." [...] NintendoLife scored it at 9/10 and referred to the game {{as one of the best}} of the system in regards to graphics, animation, and gameplay, stating [...] "Ristar proves that taking a radical approach to play control in a platformer can sometimes really pay off in the end.
