25|$|After the {{revision}} outage, at 1 to 2% of reactor power, the new protection system for Beznau 1 and its <b>internal</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> {{was to be}} started up with a test program. During synchronization with the new protection equipment, {{one of the two}} turbo groups inadvertently increased the load, and this caused a rise in reactor power to 12.6%. Since only the auxiliary feedwater pumps are in operation during low power, the amount of water supplied was insufficient to feed the steam generator, leading to an automatic reactor scram. The inadvertent demand on the turbo group was caused by an unforeseen reaction of the automatic turbine controller. Besides, the reactor already went critical at 251°C instead of at the prescribed minimum temperature of 276°C. The deviation from the operation specifications led to a level 1 assessment (Swiss scale level B).|$|E
2500|$|Analog meters {{can measure}} {{voltage and current}} by using power from the test circuit, but require a {{supplementary}} internal voltage source for resistance testing, while electronic meters always require an <b>internal</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> to run their internal circuitry. [...] Hand-held meters use batteries, while bench meters usually use mains power; either arrangement allows the meter to test devices. Testing often requires that the component under test be isolated from the circuit {{in which they are}} mounted, as otherwise stray or leakage current paths may distort measurements. [...] In some cases, the voltage from the multimeter may turn active devices on, distorting a measurement, or in extreme cases even damage an element in the circuit being investigated.|$|E

50|$|Both the D-17B and the D-37C {{computers}} were {{designed and built}} by Autonetics, then a division of North American Aviation, later a division of Boeing, for the real time guidance and control of a Minuteman ICBM from launch to detonation. The D-17B is {{a component of the}} NS-10Q missile guidance system for the Minuteman I, while the D-37C is a component of the NS-17 missile guidance system for the Minuteman II. There are many basic similarities between the two designs. They are both synchronous, serial machines with fixed head disks for primary memory. They have two-address instructions, half and whole word precision, and many similar instruction operator codes. The differences in the two computers are based mainly upon their differing technologies. The D-17B was built in 1962 using transistors and other discrete components to realize its logic circuits. On the other hand, the D-37C was built in 1964 using small scale integrated circuits made by Texas Instruments with discrete components only in the <b>internal</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies.</b>|$|R

50|$|In electronics, {{sense is}} a {{technique}} used in <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> to produce the correct voltage for a load.
