5|$|During the afternoon, {{satellites}} {{revealed that}} Laura <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> a deep warm core, {{a characteristic of}} a tropical cyclone, but the wind field remained subtropical in nature. By the nighttime hours, the radius of the strongest winds contracted to 80mi (130km), much smaller than what is typical of a subtropical cyclone. However, Laura was still {{under the influence of}} an upper-level low and cloud tops remained shallow. However, the cloud tops became colder overnight and Laura {{was on the verge of}} becoming a tropical cyclone by the morning of September30, but strong interaction with the upper-level low meant it was still subtropical. Despite moving over colder waters, a water vapor satellite image determined that Laura had separated itself from the upper-level low, signifying it <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> into a tropical cyclone. Laura was re-classified as a tropical storm at a relatively high latitude, 40.6°N. Not long after being declared tropical, early signs of an extratropical transition appeared. Cold air began to enter the storm on the west side and forecast models showed Laura becoming extratropical the next morning and non-tropical later the next day.|$|E
