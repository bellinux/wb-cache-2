5|$|Cervical {{stenosis}} {{refers to}} an abnormally narrow cervical canal, typically associated with trauma caused by removal of tissue for investigation or treatment of cancer, or cervical cancer itself. <b>Diethylstilbestrol,</b> used from 1938 to 1971 to prevent preterm labour and miscarriage, is also strongly associated {{with the development of}} cervical stenosis and other abnormalities in the daughters of the exposed women. Other abnormalities include: vaginal adenosis, in which the squamous epithelium of the ectocervix becomes columnar; cancers such as clear cell adenocarcinomas; cervical ridges and hoods; and development of a cockscomb cervix appearance.|$|E
5|$|Changes {{in the way}} {{research}} ethics was visualised in {{the wake}} of the Nuremberg Trials (1946), led to an atmosphere of protectionism of groups deemed to be vulnerable that was often legislated or regulated. This resulted in the relative underrepresentation of women in clinical trials. The position of women in research was further compromised in 1977, when in response to the tragedies resulting from thalidomide and <b>diethylstilbestrol</b> (DES), the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prohibited women of child bearing years from participation in early stage clinical trials. In practice this ban was often applied very widely to exclude all women. Women, at least those in the child bearing years, were also deemed unsuitable research subjects due to their fluctuating hormonal levels during the menstrual cycle. However, research has demonstrated significant biological differences between the sexes in rates of susceptibility, symptoms and response to treatment in many major areas of health, including heart disease and some cancers. These exclusions pose a threat to the application of evidence-based medicine to women, and compromise to care offered to both women and men.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diethylstilbestrol</b> is a nonsteroidal {{estrogen}} that is {{no longer}} used medically. It {{is a member of the}} stilbestrol group. Other stilbestrol estrogens that have been used clinically include benzestrol, dienestrol, dienestrol acetate, <b>diethylstilbestrol</b> dipropionate, fosfestrol, hexestrol, and methestrol dipropionate. Chlorotrianisene, methallenestril, and doisynoestrol are nonsteroidal estrogens structurally distinct from the stilbestrols that have also been used clinically.|$|E
25|$|Estrogens {{have been}} used in the {{treatment}} of prostate cancer. The estrogens that {{have been used}} include <b>diethylstilbestrol,</b> fosfestrol (<b>diethylstilbestrol</b> diphosphate), ethinylestradiol, ethinylestradiol sulfonate, polyestradiol phosphate, and estradiol undecylate, as well as the combined estrogenic and nitrogen mustard alkylating antineoplastic agent estramustine phosphate. Newer estrogens with improved tolerability and safety like GTx-758 have also been studied. Estrogens are effective in the treatment of prostate cancer because they are functional antiandrogens. They both suppress testosterone concentrations to castrate levels via their antigonadotropic activity and they reduce the percentage of free and bioavailable testosterone by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin production and levels. Estrogens {{have been found to be}} equivalent in effectiveness to androgen deprivation therapy with castration and nonsteroidal antiandrogens. However, they significantly increase cardiovascular mortality, and for this reason, are now little used in prostate cancer. Although the most commonly employed estrogens like <b>diethylstilbestrol</b> and ethinylestradiol are associated with increased cardiovascular mortality, it is notable that certain estrogens, namely polyestradiol phosphate, have been found not to do so; this is attributed to different degrees of effect of the various estrogens on hepatic protein synthesis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diethylstilbestrol</b> (DES) is a {{synthetic}} form of estrogen. It {{has been used}} between the early 1940s and 1971. Pregnant women took DES to prevent certain pregnancy complications. However, it also increased their risk of breast cancer. It also increased {{the risk of breast}} cancer in the prenatally exposed daughters after they have reached an age 40 years.|$|E
25|$|High {{doses of}} potent estrogens such as <b>diethylstilbestrol</b> and {{ethinylestradiol}} {{were used in}} the past in the treatment of breast cancer. Their effectiveness is approximately equivalent to that of antiestrogen therapy with tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors. The use of high dose estrogen therapy in breast cancer has mostly been superseded by antiestrogen therapy due to the improved safety profile of the latter.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diethylstilbestrol</b> (DES), {{also known}} {{formerly}} (and inappropriately) as stilboestrol, is a synthetic, nonsteroidal estrogen of the stilbestrol {{group that was}} first synthesized in 1938. It is also classified as an endocrine disruptor. Human exposure to DES occurred through diverse sources, such as dietary ingestion from supplemented cattle feed and medical treatment for certain conditions, including breast and prostate cancers. From about 1940 to 1971, DES was given to pregnant women in the mistaken belief it would {{reduce the risk of}} pregnancy complications and losses.|$|E
25|$|The {{prenatal}} hormonal {{theory of}} sexual orientation suggests {{that people who are}} exposed to excess levels of sex hormones have masculinized brains and show increased homosexuality or bisexuality. Studies providing evidence for the masculinization of the brain have, however, not been conducted to date. Research on special conditions such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and exposure to <b>diethylstilbestrol</b> (DES) indicate that prenatal exposure to, respectively, excess testosterone and estrogens are associated with female–female sex fantasies in adults. Both effects are associated with bisexuality rather than homosexuality.|$|E
25|$|Hormonal {{contraception}} {{is considered}} as harmless for the embryo. Peterka and Novotná do however state that syntethic progestines {{used to prevent}} miscarriage in the past frequently caused masculinization of the outer reproductive organs of female newborns due to their androgenic activity. <b>Diethylstilbestrol</b> is a synthetic estrogen used from the 1940s to 1971 when the prenatal exposition {{has been linked to}} the clear-cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina. Following studies showed elevated risks for other tumors and congenital malformations of the sex organs for both sexes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diethylstilbestrol</b> (DES) is a {{synthetic}} nonsteroidal estrogen and was widely used for preventing threatened abortion. DES also has effect on {{development of the}} reproductive system. Low dose of DES exhibits inhibitory effect on plasma testosterone concentration in male rats while promotes follicular maturation in female rats. Experiments were done to see the effects of DES on SDN-POA volume. It is demonstrated that DES treatment altered the volume of SDN-POA in females by increasing it, resulting in larger volume SDN than controlled females. However, low dose of DES did not change the volume of SDN-POA in male rats.|$|E
25|$|High dose {{estrogen}} {{therapy with}} estrogens such as <b>diethylstilbestrol,</b> ethinylestradiol, and estradiol undecylate {{has been used}} in the past to treat prostate cancer in men. It is effective because estrogens are functional antiandrogens, capable of suppressing testosterone levels to castrate concentrations and decreasing free testosterone levels by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) production. High dose estrogen therapy is associated with poor tolerability and safety, namely severe gynecomastia and cardiovascular complications such as thrombosis, and for this reason, has largely been replaced by newer antiandrogens such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues and nonsteroidal antiandrogens. It is still sometimes used in the treatment of prostate cancer however, and newer estrogens with atypical profiles such as GTx-758 that have improved tolerability profiles are being studied for possible application in prostate cancer.|$|E
25|$|Meyer-Bahlburg {{believes}} homosexuality may be {{an issue}} of brain chemistry. He has observed that women who took the synthetic estrogen <b>Diethylstilbestrol</b> when pregnant {{were more likely to}} have daughters with bisexual or homosexual tendencies. His research interests include the effect of biological factors, medical treatments, gender assignment, and rearing conditions in the development of gender-related behavior, temperament, sexual orientation, and gender identity in various forms of intersexuality. He has published on the effect of genital ambiguity and genital surgery on later sexual functioning in 46,XX congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Meyer-Bahlburg published with John Money and others on the topic of psychoneuroendocrinology and its effects on sexual orientation and gender identity. In collaboration with Maria New, Meyer-Bahlburg published a long term analysis of the psychological effects of the use of prenatal dexamethasone to treat Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia.|$|E

2500|$|The {{reference}} source Dictionary of Organic Compounds, 6th edition (1996) lists <b>diethylstilbestrol</b> (pp.2175–76) as a nonsteroidal estrogen with carcinogenic properties that [...] "causes male impotence and transsexual changes, especially in offspring exposed in utero".|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "synthetic" [...] is {{also used}} {{incorrectly}} by lay [...] "experts" [...] in two different ways - {{to refer to the}} process used to manufacture all estrogens, including bioidentical estrogens, and to compounds that interact with estrogen receptors similarly to estrogen molecules, but that are not found in nature. [...] Examples of the latter two include <b>diethylstilbestrol</b> and ethinylestradiol.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Diethylstilbestrol</b> (DES), a {{drug that}} {{has been in the past}} {{prescribed}} to prevent miscarriages, has also been studied in relation to women's sexual orientation. It has been observed to exert a masculinizing/defeminizing [...] effect on the developing brain of the fetus. When compared to controls, higher percentages of DES-exposed women (17% vs 0%) reported that they had engaged in same-sex relations; however, the great majority of DES women stated an exclusively heterosexual orientation.|$|E
2500|$|Pincus and McCormick enlisted Harvard {{clinical}} professor of gynecology John Rock, chief of gynecology at the Free Hospital for Women and {{an expert in the}} treatment of infertility, to lead clinical research with women. At a scientific conference in 1952, Pincus and Rock, who had known each other for many years, discovered they were using similar approaches to achieve opposite goals. In 1952, Rock induced a three-month anovulatory [...] "pseudo-pregnancy" [...] state in eighty of his infertility patients with continuous gradually increasing oral doses of estrogen (<b>diethylstilbestrol</b> 5–30mg/day) and progesterone (50–300mg/day) and within the following four months 15% became pregnant.|$|E
2500|$|Although some {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} patients may be at higher risk for ectopic pregnancy with advancing age, {{it is believed that}} age is a variable which could act as a surrogate for other risk factors. Vaginal douching is thought by some to increase ectopic pregnancies. Women exposed to <b>diethylstilbestrol</b> (DES) in utero (also known as [...] "DES daughters") also have an elevated risk of ectopic pregnancy. It has also been suggested that pathologic generation of nitric oxide through increased iNOS production may decrease tubal ciliary beats and smooth muscle contractions and thus affect embryo transport, which may consequently result in ectopic pregnancy. The low socioeconomic status may be risk factors for ectopic pregnancy.|$|E
2500|$|In 1938, British {{scientists}} {{obtained a}} patent on a newly formulated nonsteroidal estrogen, <b>diethylstilbestrol</b> (DES), that was cheaper and {{more powerful than the}} previously manufactured estrogens. Soon after, concerns over the side effects of DES were raised in scientific journals while the drug manufacturers came together to lobby for governmental approval of DES. It was only until 1941 when estrogen therapy was finally approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. Premarin (conjugated equine estrogens) was introduced in 1941 and succeeded Emmenin, the sales of which had begun to drop after 1940 due to competition from DES. Ethinylestradiol was synthesized in 1938 by Hans Herloff Inhoffen and Walter Hohlweg at Schering AG in Berlin and was approved by the [...] in the [...] on June 25, 1943 and marketed by Schering as Estinyl.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, the British {{biochemist}} Edward Charles Dodds tested BPA as an artificial estrogen, but {{found it to}} be 37,000 times less effective than estradiol. Dodds eventually developed a structurally similar compound, <b>diethylstilbestrol</b> (DES), which was used as a synthetic estrogen drug in women and animals until it was banned due to its risk of causing cancer; the ban on use of DES in humans came in 1971 and in animals, in 1979. [...] BPA was never used as a drug. [...] BPA's ability to mimic the effects of natural estrogen derive from the similarity of phenol groups on both BPA and estradiol, which enable this synthetic molecule to trigger estrogenic pathways in the body. Typically phenol-containing molecules similar to BPA are known to exert weak oestrogenic activities, thus it is also considered an endocrine disrupter (ED) and oestrogenic chemical. Xenoestrogens is another category the chemical BPA fits under because of its capability to interrupt the network that regulates the signals which control the reproductive development in humans and animals.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that differences in penis size between individuals are caused not only by genetics, but also by environmental factors such as culture, diet, and chemical or pollution exposure. Endocrine disruption resulting from chemical exposure has been linked to genital deformation in both sexes (among many other problems). Chemicals from both synthetic (e.g., pesticides, anti-bacterial triclosan, plasticizers for plastics) and natural (e.g., chemicals found in tea tree oil and lavender oil) sources have been linked to various degrees of endocrine disruption. Both PCBs and the plasticizer DEHP have been associated with smaller penis size. DEHP metabolites measured from the urine of pregnant women have been significantly associated with the decreased penis width, shorter anogenital distance, and the incomplete descent of testicles of their newborn sons, replicating effects identified in animals. Approximately 25% of US women have phthalate levels similar to those in the study. A 2007 study by University of Ankara, Faculty of Medicine found that penile size may decrease as a result of some hormonal therapy combined with external beam radiation therapy. [...] In addition, some estrogen-based fertility drugs like <b>diethylstilbestrol</b> (DES) have been linked to genital abnormalities or a smaller than normal penis (microphallus).|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes {{the reverse}} {{situation}} to a novus actus occurs, i.e. factual causation cannot be proved {{but the court}} nevertheless does want to hold the defendant liable. [...] In Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories, [...] the plaintiff's mother consumed <b>diethylstilbestrol</b> as a miscarriage preventative. The medicine, later re-called from the market, caused the defendant to develop a malignant bladder tumor due to its negligent manufacture. However, there were many manufacturers of that drug in the market. [...] The manufacturer of the particular medication that caused the injury could not be ascertained for certain. [...] The {{court held that the}} defendant was liable in proportion to its market share. [...] They departed from traditional notions of pure cause and adopted a ‘risk based’ approach to liability. [...] The defendant was held liable because of the amount of risk it contributed to the occasioning of the harm. [...] Note that a risk theory is not strictly a theory built on notions of cause at all, as, by definition, the person who caused the injury could not be ascertained for certain. [...] However, it does show that legal notions of causation are a complex mixture of factual causes and ideas of public policy relating to the availability of legal remedies. In R v Miller , the House of Lords said that a person who puts a person in a dangerous position, in that case a fire, will be criminally liable if he does not adequately rectify the situation.|$|E
