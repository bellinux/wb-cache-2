40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2016. Microbial {{spoilage}} {{has been}} reported in various food products and this has led to increased food, fruit and beverage losses, thereby threatening economic growth, food safety and security. Furthermore, statistics have shown that more than 30 % of agricultural produce in developing countries, mostly in Africa, is lost owing to microbial spoilage. Beverages, food and fruits are predominant contributors to the South African export market. In recent years, contamination of these products resulting in spoilage has been a problem, although partial spoilage control has been achieved using chemical preservatives such as <b>dimethyl</b> <b>dicarbonate,</b> sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, and sulphur dioxide (SO 2). However, prolonged exposure to these chemical preservatives can cause human health problems such as skin and/or eyesight damage, muscle and stomach pain, cardiovascular disease and the impairment of brain function.

40|$|Sulfur dioxide (SO 2) is {{probably}} one of the most versatile and efficient additives used in winemaking due to its antiseptic and antioxidant properties. This compound is also important for minimizing phenolic polymerization rate and color loss during wine aging. However, allergies caused by SO 2 -derived compounds, namely the sulfites, are becoming more frequent, causing symptoms such as headaches, nausea, gastric irritation, and breathing difficulties in asthma patients. Consequently, the legislated maximum concentration of SO 2 allowed in wines has been gradually reduced. For this reason, it is crucial in a competitive global winemaking market strategy, to reduce or even eliminate the use of SO 2 as a preservative and to search for new healthier and safe strategies. This work gives an overview of the main methodologies that have been proposed so far and that have potential to be used in winemaking as an alternative to SO 2.

Our previous study has shown that the combinations of UV and antimicrobials reduces the number of this organism significantly in fresh brine, but brine is usually recycled from days to weeks depending on its use. Therefore, this study is focused on the reduction of L. monocytogenes in recycled chill brine (obtained from a frankfurter processor) using the combinations of UV and antimicrobial agents, such as citric acid (CA), hydrogen peroxide (HP) and <b>dimethyl</b> <b>dicarbonate</b> (DMDC).

40|$|Several {{microbial}} species {{associated with}} wine were challenged against increasing concentrations of <b>dimethyl</b> <b>dicarbonate</b> (DMDC). The concentration inducing complete cell death upon addition to red wine {{was regarded as}} the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). In dry red wines with 12 % (v/v) ethanol and pH 3. 50, the inactivation depended on the initial cell concentration. For an initial inoculum of 500 CFU/ml, the MIC of the yeasts species Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Dekkera bruxellensis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia guilliermondii was 100 mg/l. The most sensitive strains belong to Zygosaccharomyces bailii, Zygoascus hellenicus and Lachancea thermotolerans, with MIC of 25 mg/l DMDC. For inoculation rates of about 106 CFU/ml, the maximum dose of DMDC legally authorised (200 mg/l) was not effective against the most resistant species. The addition of 100 mg/l potassium metabisulphite (PMB), equivalent to 1 mg/l molecular sulphur dioxide, increased the inactivation effect of 100 mg/l DMDC over initial yeast populations of 106 CFU/ml but did not fully kill S. pombe and S. cerevisiae. Lactic acid and acetic acid bacteria were not killed {{by the addition of}} 300 mg/l of DMDC. Trials performed in wines before bottling showed that in most samples indigenous bacterial populations were not affected by 200 mg/l DMDC.

All tested compounds showed inhibitory effect on the growth of Brettanomyces. Chitosan and the enological tannins showed selectivity against Brettanomyces, and PMB showed the highest efficacy in concentrations under the currently permitted limits for enological use; consequently, PMB was further evaluated in red wines naturally contaminated by Brettanomyces. Volatile phenol concentrations were determined after long-term storage of the wines treated with PMB. A direct correlation was demonstrated between the concentrations of 4 -ethylphenol, 4 -ethylguaiacol, 4 -propylguaiacol and Brettanomyces populations in the studied wines, and these parameters correlated inversely with the concentrations of PMB employed. This is the first time that 4 -propylguaiacol is shown to correlate with Brettanomyces population in wine. It is of enological significance that a concentration of 100 mg/L of total PMB efficiently prevented Brettanomyces growth in the aging red wines of our study and that volatile phenol concentrations were significantly (p < 0. 05) higher in those poorly protected wines.

40|$|Wine is {{subjected}} to many sources of microbial contamination throughout the wine making process, including {{but not limited to}} fermentation, barrel maturation, bottling, etc. In wineries, sanitation protocols should consider not only the type of microorganisms that need to be challenged, but also the type of surface {{that is going to be}} sanitized, since contact surfaces need to be treated differently according to physical and chemical properties. In the past, chlorinated compounds were used as sanitizers in wine industry, however we now know that they can be involved in the formation of trichloroanisoles (TCA), resulting in wine defects. Chlorine dioxide unlike other chlorinated compounds does not form TCA, or at least at very low levels. However, this research concluded its poor efficacy to sanitize wine barrels, likely due to the organic nature of the barrels. Alternative sanitizers in wine industry also include: sulfur dioxide, peroxyacetic acid, hot water, steam, ozone, etc. On the other hand, Velcorin ® (<b>Dimethyl</b> <b>dicarbonate</b> or DMDC) is currently used as a wine sterilant, however, due to its high disinfection effectiveness against yeast, we investigated its potential as a sanitizer for wine contact surfaces. None of the sanitizers mentioned here have been evaluated under strict controlled and/or standardized conditions (concentration, time, kind of surface, etc.) against common wine spoilage microorganisms. This is of utmost importance for wine industry, since instituted changes should be implemented for the improvement of winery sanitation practices. We evaluated the majority of these sanitizers under both in vitro and in vivo conditions in order to validate their effective parameters. Other sanitizers were only evaluated for their in vitro or in vivo effectiveness, due to regulatory restrictions for the currently unapproved applications. Of all the sanitizers evaluated, steam treatment for 10 minutes and peroxyacetic acid at 200 mg/L for one week exposure were the most effective. During this research, an important observation was made, that Brettanomyces bruxellensis displays unique colony morphology when isolated from different sources. This wine spoilage yeast is known to cause off aromas in wines and the varying colony morphology may suggest varying susceptibilities to sanitizers, depending on morphology type. 2019 - 01 - 2...|$|E

However, Alicyclobacillus, a significant spoilage bacterium in the juice s {{and beverages}}, and patulin, a heat stable mycotoxin commonly associated with apple juice and cider, are critical concerns for juice and beverage industry. Non-thermal treatments and techniques have been investigated as potential methods to control patulin and Alicyclobacillus in juices. Ultraviolet radiation (UV) was used to control patulin in apple juice from concentrate (UV exposure from 14. 2 to 99. 4 mJ/cm 2) and kinetic degradation models between apple cider and apple juice from concentrate were compared. UV radiation was shown to effectively reduce patulin with minimal cha nges in physicochemical properties and sensory characteristics of apple juice from concentrate. Patulin reduction by UV radiation in apple juice from concentrate followed first -order kinetics. <b>Dimethyl</b> <b>dicarbonate</b> (DMDC) with 0, 50, 125, and 250 ppm, and papain and bromelain (0, 100, and 1000 ppm) were used to investigate the inhibitory effect of vegetative cells and spores of Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris strains VF, WAC, and SAC in potato dextrose broth (PDB), apple juice, and orange juice. DMDC showed a significant reduction in vegetative cells and spores of Alicyclobacillus in all samples, with no changes in juice quality, whereas, papain and bromelain showed antimicrobial activity only against vegetative cells of all strains with all samples, and minimal alterations in juice quality and sensory attributes. Various media and potential bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were evaluated as alternative biopreservation methods to control Alicyclobacillus. Potato dextrose agar pH 3. 5 (PDA) was the only medium that allowed the growth of Alicyclobacillus whereas sodium citrate and dipotassium phosphate (APT ingredients) inhibited Alicyclobacillus species. No potential bacteriocin-producing LAB were isolated from kimchi and fermented apple slurries. Non-thermal treatments including non-thermal processing and natural antimicrobial compounds were investigated as alternative treatments to enhance the microbiological safety and quality of juices. The physicochemical and sensory properties of these alternative methods need to be preserved which assists in promoting the juice and beverage market through enhancing consumer's trust by ensuring consistently wholesome and safe products...|$|E
40|$|We {{aimed to}} improve the quality of grape juices and wines by using natural {{antimicrobials}} and processing techniques to reduce sulfite usage and anthocyanin losses, and by utilizing crossflow filtration to increase sustainability. We evaluated harvest and processing methods {{to improve the}} quality of bottled Niagara grape juice stored at 18 °C. Handpick vs mechanical harvest, early and late harvest date, potassium metabisulfite vs ascorbic acid (AA) addition (antioxidants), aeration and fining agents effect, hot-break prior pressing, filtering conditions and hotpack temperature, were evaluated. Late harvest juices had better quality. AA juice quality was comparable to sulfited juices, thus AA could be used as sulfite substitute. Hot-break juices had significantly higher phenolic and antioxidant capacity, lower turbidity and brown color than traditional cold-pressed juices; however, hot-break juices darkened faster over time. Harvesting method, hot-pack and hot-break temperature did not affect juice quality. Compared to traditional diatomaceous earth (DE) filtration, 500 kDa polymeric crossflow membrane filtered-juices had lower turbidity and brown color. Ceramic membranes produced juices with comparable quality to DE. Fining agents partially removed browning precursors but were not as effective as sulfite in browning prevention. The effectiveness of traditional and natural antimicrobials for shelf-life extension in cold-filled Niagara juices (still and carbonated) inoculated with yeast was assessed. Best results were obtained with 250 ppm <b>dimethyl</b> <b>dicarbonate</b> alone or in combination with 5 - 10 ppm natamycin for shelf-life extension comparable to juices with 0. 05 % sorbate/benzoate of about 160 days. Ceramic and polymeric crossflow membrane microfiltrations for 4 NY red and white wines were evaluated against DE. All filters produced microbiologically stable wines with comparable quality, but only ceramic membrane wines were perceived similarly to DE. For tank bottoms (higher solids content), ceramic membrane filtration represented a more sustainable operation. Loses of anthocyanins with potassium bitartrate (KHT) coprecipitation during cold-stabilization were largely controlled by pH of model solutions. Loses were minimized when pH [LESS-THAN OR EQUAL TO] 2. 95 which was likely due to neutralization of negatively charged KHT crystal surface. Anthocyanin coprecipitation decreased as potassium concentration increased, indicating both compounds were competing coprecipitation. Rutinosides were less likely to coprecipitate than glucosides. fo...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Food Science, Washington State UniversityYeast {{contamination}} during winemaking, {{particularly by}} Brettanomyces bruxellensis or Zygosaccharomyces bailii, {{can have a}} detrimental impact on wine quality if growth is not controlled. Nevertheless, speculation exists that some Z. bailii strains could be beneficial during vinification, particularly for stuck fermentations. Therefore red wines adjusted to 13, 15, or 17 % v/v ethanol and containing 40 or 60 g/l fructose were inoculated with Z. bailii. However, a Saccharomyces wine strain was more effective at removing the residual sugar and produced less volatile acidity. Consequently, antimicrobial technologies to limit undesirable yeast growth were also evaluated. The efficacy of 200 mg/l <b>dimethyl</b> <b>dicarbonate</b> (DMDC) was determined against yeasts originally isolated from regional vineyards, including Candida oleophila, Candida californica, Metschnikowia pulcherrima, Meyerozyma caribbica, Meyerozyma guilliermondii, and Wickerhamomyces anomalus, inoculated into grape must. Following treatment to 10 ^ 4 or 10 ^ 6 cfu/ml of each yeast, populations initially declined several logs but within several days increased to > 10 ^ 6 cfu/ml, regardless of inocula or strain. When DMDC was added to grape must with Z. bailii, 10 ^ 3 cfu/ml populations were not detected following treatment, although 10 ^ 6 cfu/ml did grow. Conversely, when DMDC was added to wines with 10 ^ 6 cfu/ml Z. bailii, growth was limited for > 85 days. Growth of B. bruxellensis in wines at populations 10 ^ 4 cfu/ml was generally limited by DMDC, although sensitivity was dependent upon strain. However, 4 -ethylphenol and 4 -ethylguiacol production was limited in wine for several years. Alternatively, a factorial experiment using wines inoculated with B. bruxellensis evaluated storage temperature (22 °, 18 °, 15 °, or 10 °C) and molecular SO 2 (mSO 2) addition (about 0. 0, 0. 2, 0. 5, or 1. 1 mg/l) and determined that while some strains could grow at either 10 °C or with about 0. 5 mg/l mSO 2; conditions of 0. 40 mg/l mSO 2 synergistically limited growth. The cumulative results demonstrated that while commercial application of Z. bailii during vinification may not be practical, reliance on DMDC or the interactive impacts of SO 2 and temperature could limit a variety yeasts associated with wine spoilage including Z. bailii and B. bruxellensis.
