40|$|The joined wing is a {{new type}} of {{aircraft}} configuration which employs tandem wings arranged to form diamond shapes in plan view and front view. Wind-tunnel tests and finite-element structural analyses have shown that the joined wing provides the following advantages over a comparable wing-plus-tail system; lighter weight and higher stiffness, higher span-efficiency factor, higher trimmed maximum lift coefficient, lower wave drag, plus built-in direct lift and <b>direct</b> <b>sideforce</b> <b>control</b> capability. A summary is given of research performed on the joined wing. Calculated joined wing weights are correlated with geometric parameters to provide simple weight estimation methods. The results of low-speed and transonic wind-tunnel tests are summarized, and guidelines for design of joined-wing aircraft are given. Some example joined-wing designs are presented and related configurations having connected wings are reviewed...|$|E

To verify these advantages at full scale a manned research airplane is required. A study has therefore been performed of the feasibility of constructing such an airplane, using the fuselage and engines of the existing NAA AD- 1 oblique-wing airplane. Cost and schedule constraints favored converting the AD- 1 rather than constructing a totally new airframe. By removing the outboard wing panels the configuration can simulate wings joined at 60, 80, or 100 percent of span. For maximum versatility the aircraft has alternative control surfaces (such as ailerons and elevators on the front and/or rear wings), and a removeable canard to explore canard/joined-wing interactions at high-lift conditions. Design, performance, and flying qualities are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The rudder {{of a ship}} is used to {{maintain}} its direction and for changing course. As such the goal of rudder design is to maximise <b>sideforce</b> for <b>control</b> of course while minimising resistive drag. Ship rudderâ€™s are typically mounted downstream of the propeller {{to take advantage of}} the higher speed flow in the propeller race. This flow also has a swirl component that results in a complex flow regime arriving at the rudder. Likewise, the presence of the rudder has an influence on the flow speed and direction passing through the propeller. It is therefore recommended that design of the propulsive system incorporates the rudder design. This will ensure that appropriate decisions are made that maximise the net propulsive thrust for a given engine power. We examine in this paper how the design of the combined propeller-rudder system can be best achieved for a goal of maximising propulsive efficiency without sacrificing the ability to manoeuvre. The design of the rudder requires careful thought as to its longitudinal, lateral and vertical position. The swirl component of propeller race results in a force distribution over the rudder that can give a net propulsive thrust by extracting energy from the flow rotation. Such effects can be used to compensate for the resistive drag of the form and surface area of the rudder itself. Design of rudders are often based on evolutionary principles that will not capture the subtleties necessary to enhance propulsive efficiency. We discuss a hierarchy of computational analysis tools that includes unsteady solution of the Navier Stokes equations, their coupling with propeller blade element momentum analysis and use of surface panel and lifting line theories to understand rudder forces. Such techniques are suitable for design optimization. Conventionally it is the rudder structural strength and associated cost of construction that limits the types of rudders that can be designed. Recent work on a variety of twisted rudders has shown that there can be significant performance gains. For more radical shapes the use of suitable composite construction will give cost-effective performance while also reducing rudder mass as well. We show through three case studies related to: (1) twisted rudders, (2) cathodic protection and (3) the influence of the rudder on kite assisted ship propulsion; that to achieve improved propulsive performance all that is required is greater care and attention to the rudder design process. Such design detail will more than cover its cost in fuel savings and the resultant reduced engine emission...|$|R
