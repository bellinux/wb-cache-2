50|$|The {{lamp burner}} has a flat wick, usually made of cotton. The {{lower part of}} the wick dips into the fount and absorbs the kerosene; the top part of the wick extends out of the wick tube of the lamp burner, which {{includes}} a wick-adjustment mechanism. Adjusting how much of the wick extends above the wick tube controls the flame. The wick tube surrounds the wick, and ensures that the correct amount of air reaches the lamp burner. Adjustment is usually done by means of a small knob operating a cric, which is a toothed, metal sprocket bearing against the wick. If the wick is too high, and extends beyond the burner cone {{at the top of the}} wick tube, the lamp will produce smoke and soot (unburned carbon). When the lamp is lit, the kerosene that the wick has absorbed burns and produces a clear, bright, yellow flame. As the kerosene burns, capillary action in the wick draws more kerosene up from the fuel tank. All kerosene flat wick lamps use the dead <b>flame</b> <b>burner</b> design, where the flame is fed cold air from below and hot air exits above.|$|E

Next, the variance in a training set, produced from CFD calculations, is captured using principal components analysis. The information in the training set allows interpolation between beam paths resulting in temperature and density maps. Finally, the TDLAS temperature and density maps are shown to agree with traditional thermocouple measurements of the flat <b>flame</b> <b>burner</b> to within five percent.

40|$|We {{report a}} series of Raman-Rayleigh-LIF {{measurements}} in two turbulent natural-gas jet diffusion flames produced by the Delft piloted jet diffusion <b>flame</b> <b>burner.</b> The main objective of the Raman-Rayleigh-LIF measurements was to obtain detailed information on the major species concentrations in the flames. The measurements provide simultaneous data on temperature, the concentrations of the major species and the radicals OH and NO and mixture fraction. The application of the Raman technique in the undiluted natural-gas flames proves to be very challenging {{because of the high}} fluorescence interference levels. The interference contributions to the recorded Raman signals are identified and subtracted using empirical correlations between the Raman signals and the signals on fluorescence interference monitor channels. The calibration and data reduction of the Raman-Rayleigh and LIF signals are discussed in detail. The resulting dataset compares excellently with data from previous experiments.

40|$|Experiments and {{numerical}} simulations {{were conducted}} to investigate {{the effects of the}} burner diameter on the flame structure and extinction limit of counterflow non-premixed methane flames in normal gravity and microgravity. Experiments were performed for counterflow flames with a large inner diameter (d) of 50 mm in normal gravity to compare the extinction limits with those obtained by previous studies where a small burner (d < 25 mm) was used. Two-dimensional (2 D) simulations were performed to clarify the flame structure and extinction limits of counterflow non-premixed flame with a three-step global reaction mechanism. One-dimensional (1 D) simulations were also performed with the same three-step global reaction mechanism to provide reference data for the 2 D simulation and experiment. For microgravity, the effect of the burner diameter on the flame location at the centerline was negligible at both high (ag = 50 s− 1) and low (ag = 10 s− 1) strain rates. However, a small <b>burner</b> <b>flame</b> (d = 15 mm) in microgravity showed large differences in the maximum flame temperature and the flame size in radial direction compared to a large <b>burner</b> <b>flame</b> (d = 50 mm) at low strain rate. In addition, for normal gravity, a small <b>burner</b> <b>flame</b> (d = 23. 4 mm) showed differences in the flame thickness, flame location, local strain rate, and maximum heat release rate compared to a large <b>burner</b> <b>flame</b> (d = 50 mm) at low strain rate. Counterflow non-premixed flames with low and high strain rates that were established in a large burner were approximated by 1 D simulation for normal gravity and microgravity. However, a counterflow non-premixed flame with a low strain rate in a small burner could not be approximated by 1 D simulation for normal gravity due to buoyancy effects. The 2 D simulations of the extinction limits correlated well with experiments for small and large <b>burner</b> <b>flames.</b> For microgravity, the extinction limit of a small <b>burner</b> <b>flame</b> (d = 15 mm) was much lower than that of a large <b>burner</b> <b>flame</b> when ag ≤ 20 s− 1.

The sooting propensities of these mixtures are estimated through the Yield Sooting Indices (YSIs) in methane diffusion flames doped with 35, 000 ppm of surrogate vapors. The characteristics of the soot volume fraction are extracted using the light extinction method (LEM). Additionally, soot generated from the combustion of the model Diesel and Biodiesel fuels were collected, sampled and characterized using physico-chemical techniques. MD addition is found to reduce sooting tendencies. This decrease is more pronounced when the concentration of oxygenate additives 2 increases. On another side, the oxidative reactivity of soot generated from the diffusion <b>flame</b> <b>burner</b> is found to decrease when the Biodiesel percentage increases. Furthermore, soot generated from the combustion of Diesel and Biodiesel surrogates exhibited different behaviors.
