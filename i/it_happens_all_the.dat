But the fact of her having again become the arbitrator, though it had made acceptance of his plans <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more probable, made refusal of them, should <b>it</b> <b>happen,</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more crushing.

5000|$|On March 17, 2005, Warner Bros. {{reported}} that Whedon {{was hired to}} write and direct the long time planned Wonder Woman feature film, while Joel Silver was attached to produce it. The film's plot was to focus on Wonder Woman's adventures during the World War II. However, on February 2, 2007, MTV {{reported that}} Whedon was no longer attached to the project, leading to its cancellation. Whedon said [...] "We just saw different movies, and at the price range this kind of movie hangs in, that's never gonna work. Non-sympatico. <b>It</b> <b>happens</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time". Despite this, after several delays, the film will be released on June 2, 2017 and directed by Patty Jenkins.|$|E
5000|$|It is a {{well known}} 'secret' that Dr Bibile was murdered by {{inducing}} cardiac arrest using a drug(s) that has been available, even before second world war. One of his colleagues {{were involved in the}} murder to ensure that he would not recover from the 'heart attack' by not taking prompt action as well as taking the wrong cause of action as well as a delayed cause of action to recover him. As a matter of fact, this doctor colleague of doctor Bibile from UN, asked Mrs Bibile for her forgiveness for letting him die that way, implying that he was simply a tool for corrupted multinational drug companies, in which she replied, [...] "If you can bring him back, then I will forgive you".

5000|$|Whedon {{was hired}} to write and direct a Warner Bros. {{adaptation}} of Wonder Woman. However, in February 2007, Whedon {{announced that he would}} no longer be involved with the project.

Conversely, he stated, [...] "the fact of the matter is, it was a waste of my time. We never wanted to make the same movie; none of us knew that". Whedon also pitched a screenplay to adapt Batman for the same company as development started on what would eventually become Batman Begins. It was described as having included a new, [...] "more of a 'Hannibal Lecter' type" [...] villain, and portrayed Bruce Wayne as [...] "a morbid, death-obsessed kid" [...] whose grief was overcome by protecting a girl from being bullied in an alley similar to where his parents were murdered.|$|E
5|$|The {{policy of}} attacking London after the {{successful}} 7 September raid quickly became counter-productive, {{and in this}} matter the Luftwaffe suffered from serious misjudgement resulting from their intelligence service. The crews had been told the RAF was down to its last reserves and that one more assault would clinch victory. This was incorrect which meant bomber crews would {{be in for a}} shock on 15 September. The RAF had been given much needed rest after intense operations by the shift in German strategy. British radar, having been virtually untouched, was still able to follow the slow German build ups over France long before the first German aircraft reached British airspace. It would give the rested Fighter Command units plenty of warning. Moreover, by choosing to attack London, it exposed the bombers to greater danger by forcing them to fly greater distances in hostile air space. German crews would be forced to fight <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way to London and back. As <b>it</b> <b>happened,</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> German bomber units were at least intercepted on 15 September, and were then scattered as they withdrew.|$|R

5000|$|Morissette {{has never}} {{publicly}} identified any particular real-life individual {{as having been}} the ex-boyfriend portrayed in the song. In 2008, she commented to a CanWest News Service journalist, [...] "Well, I've never talked about who my songs were about and I won't, because when I write them they're written {{for the sake of}} personal expression. So {{with all due respect to}} whoever may see themselves in my songs, and <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time, I never really comment on it because I write these songs for myself, not other people."Nonetheless, in comments made on different occasions, actor-comedian Dave Coulier has alternately admitted to and denied being the subject of the song. In 1997 the Boston Herald reported that Coulier [...] "admitted the lines are very close to home. Especially the one about 'an older version of me' and bugging him Coulier 'in the middle of dinner.'" [...] Coulier's former television co-star Bob Saget said in one interview that he was present when Morissette made that call during dinner, although it was not clear whether Saget was joking.|$|E
5000|$|This matchless {{track record}} of anarchic {{pioneering}} prompted Nick Cave to declare, [...] "Mark Stewart changed everything". Reflecting on his far-reaching influence, Mark says, [...] "I thought I was making funk music, but a track on Veneer of Democracy supposedly inspired all the American industrialists, like Front Line Assembly and Skinny Puppy, while another track supposedly inspired the Bristol kids. <b>It</b> <b>happens</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time. I’ve got this nonchalance that nothing is sacred so I’ll crash a Slayer guitar line with Rotterdam gabba beats. For me, it's like colours. I grew up doing montages; like I did this collage of Ronald Reagan’s head on this gay porno cowboy. In fact, I’ve never really grown up at all. I’m still trying to put round things into square holes." [...] Stewart released his next single through Future Noise Music on Black Friday 25 November 2011. The Double A-side [...] "Children of the Revolution" [...] / [...] "Nothing Is Sacred" [...] features The Bug, Crass's Eve Libertine, Berlin's Slope and Pop Group bassist Dan Catsis. This {{paved the way for}} Stewart's 2012 album, The Politics of Envy, released on 26 March 2012, also on Future Noise Music. Tackling mass media, modern capitalism and consumer apathy, it features a cast including Kenneth Anger, Lee 'Scratch' Perry, Richard Hell, The Raincoats' Gina Birch, Primal Scream and Clash/PiL guitarist Keith Levene.|$|E
5000|$|Hard Candy was {{released}} on April 25, 2008, in the European countries of Germany, Ireland, Austria and Netherlands. On April 28, the album {{was released}} in the United Kingdom, Brazil and {{throughout the rest of}} Europe, and on April 29, in the United States, Mexico and Canada. Billboard reported that the title of the album was Licorice, as announced on the Sirius Satellite Radio programme OutQ. In an interview with MTV Australia, Madonna explained that a prominent theme of the Hard Candy album was about incorporating the image of a boxer, an idea which has been repeated within the song [...] "Give It 2 Me". According to her, [...] "It 2 Me' is basically in meaning. I'm not ..., 'give me all you got' of person, so it's quite a sort of tough stance." [...] Hence, initially Madonna decided that the title of the song was to be used for the then-unnamed album. This was changed following the release of a similarly named song by Timbaland. After that, Madonna decided to call the album Black Madonna, and even shot a photograph for the cover art, wearing blackface make-up with white eyes. In a 2009 interview with Rolling Stone Madonna commented:"I did a photoshoot with Steven Klein for my last album cover, and I painted my face black, except for red lips and white eyes. It was a play on words. Have you ever heard of the Black Madonna? It has layers of meaning and for a minute, I {{thought it would be a}} fun title for my record.

But I did wish Allan Quatermain to be killed, because he had won her whom I loved, though, as <b>it</b> <b>happened,</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> others were slain, and he alone escaped. Then I came here and learned that Marie was his wife--yes, his wife indeed--and grew mad with hate and jealousy. So I bore false witness against him, and, you fools, you believed me and ordered me to shoot him who is innocent before God and man. Then things went wrong. The woman tricked me again--for the last time. She dressed herself as the man, and in the dawnlight I was deceived. I killed her, her whom I love alone, and now her father, who loved her also, has killed me." ...|$|R
