500|$|The {{committee}} {{keeps the}} list of species it considers under review and, from time to time, makes changes. These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion. A species is removed if {{it has more than}} 150 records in the preceding ten years, with ten or more in at least eight of those years. Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 (see below). [...] There have been three major [...] "purges" [...] of species since the committee's formation. The first was soon after the committee's formation, in 1963, when 16 species were removed: red-crested pochard, snow goose, pectoral sandpiper, Mediterranean gull, Sabine's gull, melodious warbler, icterine warbler, yellow-browed warbler, northern goshawk, golden eagle, red kite, Kentish plover, crested tit, bearded tit, marsh warbler and Dartford warbler. Records of the last eight species had been considered only outside their [...] "normal" [...] British range (e.g. crested tits outside Scotland, and red kites outside Wales). The second was in 1982, when ten further species were removed: Cory's shearwater, purple heron, white stork, buff-breasted sandpiper, Richard's pipit, tawny pipit, Savi's warbler, aquatic warbler, serin and common rosefinch. Savi's warbler was re-admitted to the committee's list in 1998, due to declining numbers of occurrences. Thirdly, in 2006, a further 17 species were dropped from the list: ferruginous duck, Wilson’s petrel, great white egret, black kite, red-footed falcon, American golden plover, white-rumped sandpiper, white-winged black tern, alpine swift, red-rumped swallow, red-throated pipit, subalpine warbler, greenish warbler, <b>dusky</b> <b>warbler,</b> Radde's warbler, Arctic redpoll and rustic bunting.

40|$|This {{summer was}} a 2 ̆ 2 {{something}} for everyone 2 ̆ 2 season. Ecologists, already excited by the apparent ability of Greater Prairie-Chickens to lek in improbable habitats, such as corn fields and dirt edges of Rainwater Basin playas, will welcome the use by Lark Buntings and Vesper Sparrows of wheat stubble fields with a growing corn crop. The Vesper Sparrows of the east, a different subspecies {{from those in the}} north and west, have been at the mercy of full-tillage cropping systems, but now have a reprieve and may even be increasing because of no-till and minimum tillage methods currently in vogue due to high fuel prices and conservation benefits. White-faced Ibis again nested in several places, and Red-shouldered Hawk is showing signs of expanding from its limited range at Fontenelle Forest. Very exciting was the confirmation of breeding {{for the first time in}} Nebraska of Ash-throated Flycatcher, only the second record of the species 2 ̆ 7 occurrence in the state. Hopefully confirmation is soon to follow for Broad-tailed Hummingbird, which has now twice been reported during the breeding season. A phenomenon that may be applicable to those early migrant passerines that appear well before local breeders seem to have finished breeding and have even contemplated migration, is molt-migration. A recent article in Birding ([URL] discusses this strategy for such species as <b>Dusky</b> Flycatcher, <b>Warbling</b> Vireo, Western Tanager, Lazuli Bunting, and Bullock 2 ̆ 7 s Oriole, which is probably best known for its early departure from breeding areas for an intermediate staging area where it molts, and then continues to its wintering grounds. The possibility was raised by Ted Floyd that Chipping Sparrow might be in this group as well. Unfortunately, other than the existence of many such rather early fall records for various species in areas where breeding does not occur, Nebraska has little data to support or contradict this idea. Observers should continue to report obvious indications of early fall movement (flocking, appearance out of breeding habitat, disappearance of adults) ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Presentation date: 1996 - 02 - 05 Breeding bird {{communities}} {{were examined in}} 18 managed Douglas-fir stands in 6 age classes from 5 to 34 years old in spring and early summer, 1993 on the Detroit Ranger District, Willamette National Forest, Oregon. The range of seral stages included early shrub/sapling, late shrub/sapling, and pole. In general, the 9 younger stands were opencanopy while the 9 older stands were closed-canopy. Of the 50 bird species recorded, 21 had large enough sample sizes for analysis. Of these 21, 8 showed a pattern of increasing abundance with increasing stand age (chestnut-backed chickadee, golden-crowned kinglet, hermit thrush, hermit warbler, Pacific-slope flycatcher, Swainson's thrush, Wilson's warbler, winter wren). Six species showed a pattern of decreasing abundance with increasing stand age (American robin, darkeyed junco, rufous hummingbird, white-crowned sparrow) and 4 species peaked in abundance in age class 2 (10 - 14 years old) before decreasing with increasing stand age (<b>dusky</b> flycatcher, MacGillivray's <b>warbler,</b> orange-crowned warbler, rufous-sided towhee). Two species did not exhibit any particular pattern associated with stand age (warbling vireo, western tanager). Three species were dropped from analysis because their average territory size {{is larger than the}} smallest stand surveyed. Abundance indices for species which showed an increasing pattern were positively associated with habitat variables describing conifer basal area, percent cover of live conifer crown between 4 m and the height of the tallest conifer tree, number of conifer stems/ha between 20 - and 30 - cm dbh, and/or percent cover of live hardwood crown between 4 m and the height of the tallest hardwood tree. Abundance indices for species which showed a decreasing or peaked abundance were negatively associated with the same variables, excluding percent cover of hardwood crown. Total abundance, species richness, and species diversity did not differ (P< 0. 05) among the age classes. However, bird community composition changed with increasing stand age. Open-canopy stands were dominated by species preferring open-canopy habitats (top 5 species in order of abundance: dark-eyed junco, MacGillivray's <b>warbler,</b> rufous hummingbird, <b>dusky</b> flycatcher, rufous-sided towhee) while closed canopy-stands were dominated by species preferring closed-canopy habitats, (hermit warbler, dark-eyed junco, chestnut-backed chickadee, golden-crowned kinglet, Swainson's thrush); the dark-eyed junco was an exception. The rate of bird community change was rapid along the gradient of open-canopy stands but appeared to reach a plateau once canopy closure was reached...|$|R

The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are yellower below. The call is a soft chick.|$|E
50|$|The island's flora include meadows, heath {{and forests}} of pine, birch and {{especially}} aspen.

Waders and ducks will {{be seen in the}} many shallow bays.The non-profit Haparanda Sandskär Bird Observatory on Sandskär was founded in 1981. Since then over 100,000 birds of 137 species have been ringed.

50|$|The colour, {{shape or}} other {{features}} of the supercilium {{can be useful in}} bird identification. For example, the supercilium of the <b>dusky</b> <b>warbler,</b> an Old World warbler species, can be used to distinguish it from the very similar Radde's warbler. The dusky warbler's supercilium is sharply demarcated, whitish and narrow in front of the eye, becoming broader and more buffy towards the rear, whereas that of the Radde's warbler is diffusely defined, yellowish and broadest in front of the eye, becoming narrower and more whitish toward the rear. The supercilium of the northern waterthrush, a New World warbler, differs subtly from that of the closely related (and similarly plumaged) Louisiana waterthrush. The Louisiana has a bicoloured supercilium which widens significantly behind the eye, while the northern has an evenly buffy eyebrow which is either the same width throughout or slightly narrower behind the eye.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Dusky</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Phylloscopusfuscatus) is a species, {{in which}} {{polygyny}} occurs {{at a high}} rate. Female choice appears {{to be based on}} the selection of a territory rather than on the selection of a male, as will be shown elsewhere. Aim of this study was to determine the role of food availability as a measure of territory quality. Territories, which were the most rich in insects during the breeding period, showed a much higher rate of polygyny than poor territories. At the same time, these rich places were occupied by the earliest arriving males and also the first clutches were found there. Surprisingly it was found, that these territories with highest food abundance during the period of raising nestlmgs, had very low insect densities in spring during the arrival of males and females, as compared to other territories. Therefore it is argued, that Dusky warblers, early in spring, are able to predict which territories will be the richest, based on vegetation characteristics and not based on a direct estimate of actual prey density. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{polygyny}} threshold model {{states that}} secondary females gain benefits from high territory quality that outweigh {{the costs of}} sharing a male. We aimed to test this prediction using the <b>dusky</b> <b>warbler</b> as a model species. We first showed that neither the shifted sex ratio hypothesis nor the no-cost models were likely to apply to our study. Secondary females settled in territories of higher quality (high food abundance, low predator density) and had a nonsignificantly higher reproductive success than simultaneously settling monogamous females. However, there were strong indications that these two groups of females differed intrinsically. Secondary females were older than late monogamous females, and while they replaced lost clutches more often, they also suffered from a nonsignificantly higher winter mortality. Consequently, {{it was impossible to}} tell whether differences in reproductive success were caused by differences in territory quality or in female qualities. Our study suggests that female choice may also depend on characteristics that are specific to the individual, and may therefore be more sophisticated than allowed for in traditional polygyny models. In other words, the polygyny threshold may be not the same for all individuals. We suggest that prior breeding experience may help older females to profit more from the benefits and to suffer less from the costs of polygyny than young females.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{territorial}} polygyny in birds has been {{influential in the}} development of the theory of social mating systems. Alternative female mating options have been studied within the framework of the polygyny-threshold model and later as the outcome of conflicts of interest between individuals. However, little attention has been given to variations between individual females, and how this affects their mating behaviour. Here, we test the hypothesis that some females are better adapted to raise nestlings without male assistance, and thus to mate polygynously. Specifically, we investigate whether intraspecific variation in female bill morphology is related to mating behaviour. This hypothesis is derived from earlier studies showing that, in both intra- and interspecific comparisons, uniparental care by females is correlated with the catching of larger prey items than when both parents provision the young. Using the polygynous <b>dusky</b> <b>warbler</b> (Phylloscopus fuscatus) as a model species, we found that, in accordance with our prediction, females with deep bills were more likely to mate as a secondary female. Moreover, regardless of mating status, females with deep bills settled in territories with more food and they received less male assistance in feeding their offspring. We argue that females with stronger bills are better adapted to exploit the abundance of large food items in rich territories and thus to raise young on their own. Our results demonstrate the importance of studying variations between individual females, and provide evidence for an extended version of the 'constrained-female hypothesis'. As bill depth is a highly heritable trait, our study strongly suggests that variation in female mating behaviour is not only related to ecological factors and female condition (as shown elsewhere) but also to heritable morphological traits...|$|E
