40|$|This article {{addresses}} boundary-layer flow {{of third}} grade fluid saturating a non-Darcy porous <b>medium.</b> <b>Induced</b> <b>flow</b> is by a stretchable surface. Flow in porous media {{is described by}} employing the Darcy-Forchheimer based model. Generalized versions of Fourierâs and Fickâs laws via Cattaneo-Christov double diffusion expressions are utilized. Transformation method is employed for reduction process of nonlinear partial differential systems into the nonlinear ordinary differential systems. Optimal homotopy analysis method (OHAM) develops the computations. The optimal values of nonzero auxiliary parameters are computed and analyzed. The optimal solutions of temperature and concentration fields are presented through the plots. The skin friction coefficient and local Nusselt and Sherwood numbers are also studied through numerical data. Our results reveal that the local Nusselt and Sherwood numbers are higher for larger values of thermal and concentration relaxation parameters.

40|$|LARC-TPI, {{a linear}} high {{temperature}} thermoplastic polyimide, was developed {{several years ago}} at NASA Langley Research Center. This material has been commercialized by Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals, Inc., Tokyo, Japan, as a varnish and powder. More recently, a melt-extruded film of a controlled molecular weight of this same polymer has been supplied to NASA Langley Research Center for evaluation. This new form, called LARC-TPI 1500 series, has been prepared in three molecular weights - high, <b>medium</b> and low <b>flow</b> polymers. The subject of this investigation deals with the rheological properties of the high and <b>medium</b> <b>flow</b> powders and the adhesive properties of the <b>medium</b> <b>flow</b> melt-extruded film. Rheological studies indicate that the high and <b>medium</b> <b>flow</b> forms of the polymer fall in the flow range of injection moldable materials. Adhesive data generated on the <b>medium</b> <b>flow</b> extruded film shows this form to be well suited for structural adhesive bonding. The data are as good or better than that for LARC-TPI data of previous studies...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{test the}} effects of a {{continuous}} <b>medium</b> <b>flow</b> inside DegraPol® scaffolds on the reepithelialization and revascularization processes of a tissue-engineered trachea prosthesis. Methods: In this proof-of-principle study a continuous <b>medium</b> <b>flow</b> was maintained within a tubular DegraPol® scaffold by an inserted porous catheter connected to a pump system. The impact of the intra-scaffold <b>medium</b> <b>flow</b> on the survival of a tracheal epithelial sheet wrapped around and on chondrocyte delivery to the DegraPol® scaffold was studied. In the chick embryo, chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model angiogenesis within the biomaterial was investigated. Results: Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) images showed an intact epithelial layer after a 2 -week support by continuous <b>medium</b> <b>flow</b> underneath. On histology, three-dimensional cell growth was detected in the continuous delivery group. The CAM assay showed that angiogenesis was enhanced within the DegraPol® scaffolds when vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor (VEGF/VPF) was added to the perfusate. Conclusions: Taken together, these results demonstrated that the built-in perfusion system within DegraPol® scaffolds was able to maintain an intact tracheal epithelial layer, allowed a continuous delivery of cells, and kept an efficient VEGF/VPF expression level which accelerated angiogenic response in the CAM assay. This design combines the in vitro and in vivo parts of tissue engineering and offers the possibility to be used as an in vivo bioreactor implanted for the tissue-engineered reconstruction of trachea and of other organ...|$|R
40|$|Down-regulation of {{detoxification}} genes, notably cytochrome P 450 (CYPs), {{in primary}} hepatocyte cultures is a long-standing and major concern. We evaluated {{the influence of}} <b>medium</b> <b>flow</b> in this model. Hepatocytes isolated from 12 different liver donors were cultured either in a multichamber modular bioreactor (MCmB, flow rate 250 - 500 μL/min) or under standard/static conditions, and the expression of 32 genes, enzyme activities and biological parameters were measured 7 - 21 days later. mRNA expression of genes involved in xenobiotic/drug metabolism and transport, including CYP 1 A 1, 1 A 2, 2 B 6, 2 C 9, 3 A 4 (and activities for some of them), UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1 A 1, UGT 2 B 4, UGT 2 B 7, glutathione S-transferase (GSTα), and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR 1) and MRP 2, were specifically up-regulated by <b>medium</b> <b>flow</b> as compared with static controls in all cultures tested. In 2 -week-old cultures, expression of detoxification genes reached levels close to or higher than those measured in freshly isolated hepatocytes. In contrast, CYP 2 D 6 and most of other tested genes were not affected by <b>medium</b> <b>flow.</b> We conclude that <b>medium</b> <b>flow</b> specifically interferes with, and up-regulates, the activity of xenosensors and/or the expression of detoxification genes in primary human hepatocytes.

Eight cubic PEOT/PBT co-polymers (1 cm(3)) were assigned into two groups. In the semi-dynamic seeding group a continuous <b>medium</b> <b>flow</b> was created inside the scaffolds by a pump system. Around six million chondrocytes were harvested each day, suspended in 1 ml medium and delivered onto the scaffold through the perfusion for a sequential five days. Traditional chondrocytes directly seeding and static culture method was performed as control. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and histology assessments were performed to evaluate the distribution of chondrocytes inside the scaffolds and MTT test was chosen to check cell vitality. SEM pictures and histology slices from the perfusion group showed a better three-dimensional cell growth and extensive cell distribution inside the scaffolds; while in the control group chondrocytes only dispersedly formed a monolayer on the surface of scaffolds. Accordingly, MTT results from the perfusion group were much higher than those from control group (0. 123 vs. 0. 067, P< 0. 01). Continuous medium perfusion inside PEOT/PBT scaffold effectively combines chondrocyte seeding and culture systems for the reconstruction of tissue engineered trachea...|$|R
