40|$|In the USA, suicide {{ranked as}} the third {{leading cause of death}} for {{adolescents}} in 1999. Non-fatal suicidal behaviours are suicidal thought, specific suicidal plan and suicide attempt. Prospective studies have emphasized the high subsequent suicide rates in clinically presenting suicide attempters. This study was planned to critically review the existing international literature on this area, and compare, if possible, with the Indian data. Both electronic and manual search for published and unpublished works was done for the review of this area. Both international and Indian studies on prevalence, risk factors, management, and prevention of non-fatal suicidal behaviours in adolescents were collected, analysed and reviewed. The study concludes that professionals, like <b>general</b> <b>practitioners,</b> <b>paediatricians,</b> school teachers, school counselors, need to be trained in identifying non-fatal suicidal behaviours in adolescents, and know when to refer them to a mental health professional or mental health service for thorough assessment and effective management.

40|$|Abstract 3 D {{television}} (TV) and cinema {{have experienced}} a recent surge in popularity aided {{in part by the}} success of films such as “Toy Story 3 ” and “Avatar”. In parallel with this trend there have been increasing concerns about the safety of 3 D TV and cinema for patients with photosensitive epilepsy. <b>General</b> <b>practitioners,</b> <b>paediatricians</b> and neurologists are being consulted about their opinions on the risk of triggering a seizure. Photosensitive epilepsy occurs in 1 in 4000 of the population but the incidence is higher in people aged 7 – 19 years. We found little evidence in the literature and confusing advice on various websites. We discuss this evidence in an attempt to clarify the advice that health professionals should be giving on this issue. We conclude that 3 D cinema and television are only unlikely to trigger seizures in patients with non-photosensitive epilepsy. In young people with photosensitive epilepsy the risk of triggering a seizure is not greater with 3 D TV or cinema than with conventional television, and we suggest means by which this risk can be minimised. We suggest removing 3 D glasses when watching conventional TV to prevent the eyes from picking up flicker.

Methods: Forty <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> and three <b>paediatricians</b> were interviewed using a semistructured purpose-designed questionnaire. Results: Most participating doctors perceived that public sector dietitians are not available to assist them in managing overweight and obese paediatric patients. Few (23 %) doctors reported using published guidelines and most reported significant barriers limiting their capacity to identify and manage this patient group effectively. All doctors identified at least one way in which the public health system can better support doctors in this role. Conclusions: The findings suggest that many doctors may benefit from increased training and a health system that better remunerates them for the time investment needed to provide management consistent with best practice. Reorientation of local public sector nutrition services may also provide them with better support when managing overweight and obese paediatric clients. Future research should examine the actual practices of doctors and how public sector dietitians can best communicate and interact with them to facilitate effective management of these patients...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{propose the}} {{introduction}} of a pilot project: "paediatric core file exchange in emergencies" (PCF-EXEM) which enables the exchange of medical data between the attending paediatrician (AP), holder of the medical record, and on-duty medical units (i. e. <b>general</b> <b>practitioners,</b> <b>paediatricians,</b> surgeons, emergency physicians, [...] .). This project is based on two pillars: a protected server (PCF-server) containing paediatric core files (PCF), with important clinical data that should be available for the physician in order to quickly get a clear insight into the relevant clinical medical history of the child, and secondly, the possibility to provide feedback to the attending physician about the findings recorded during the on-call duty. The permanent availability of health data on the PCF-server and the possibility to provide feedback represent together the PCF-EXEM-project. This project meets the demand of the care providers to have relevant medical information permanently available in order to guarantee high quality care in emergency situations. The frail balance between the right to informative privacy and professional confidentiality {{on the one hand and}} the right to quality health care on the other hand has been taken into account. The technical and practical feasibility of this project is described. The objectives and vision of the PCF-EXEM project are conform to Belgian legislation concerning the processing of medical data and are in line with the still under consideration European projects which are focusing on interoperability and the development of a common access control to databanks containing health data for care providers.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess and}} compare the {{training}} needs in adolescent medicine of doctors within 6 specialties {{as a basis for}} the development of pre/postgraduate and continuing medical education (CME) training curricula. DESIGN: Cross-sectional postal survey. SETTING: Switzerland. PARTICIPANTS: National, representative, random sample of 1857 practising doctors in 6 disciplines (<b>general</b> <b>practitioners,</b> <b>paediatricians,</b> gynaecologists, internists, psychiatrists, child psychiatrists) registered with the Swiss Medical Association. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Perceived importance of and training interest in 35 topics related to adolescent medicine listed in a self-administered, anonymous questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 1367 questionnaires were returned, representing a response rate of 73. 9 %. Clear interest in adolescent medicine was reported by 62. 1 % of respondents. Topics perceived {{to be the most important}} in everyday practice were functional symptoms (71. 4 %), acne (67. 1 %), obesity (64. 6 %), depression-anxiety (68. 1 %) and communication with adolescents (61. 7 %). Differences between disciplines were especially marked for gynaecologists, who expressed interest almost exclusively in medical topics specific to their field. In contrast, other disciplines commonly reported a keen interest in psychosocial problems. Accordingly, interest in further training was expressed mostly for functional symptoms (62. 4 %), eating disorders (56. 3 %), depression-anxiety (53. 7 %) and obesity (52. 6 %). Issues related to injury prevention, chronic disease and confidentiality were rated as low priorities. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of discipline, Swiss primary care doctors expressed a strong interest in adolescent medicine. Continuing medical education courses should include both interdisciplinary courses and discipline-specific sessions. Further training should address epidemiological and legal/ethical issues (e. g. injury prevention, confidentiality, impact of chronic conditions) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper compares health {{services}} for children in Denmark, Germany, Austria and Great Britain using the following dimensions: (1) coverage, where it is asked under which conditions children are covered by the health care system; (2) access, where the family doctor principle in Denmark and Great Britain is compared with the free choice of doctors in Germany and Austria; (3) organizational structure, which is important for co-ordination and co-operation of service providers and {{for the possibility of}} orientating oneself within the health care system; (4) comprehensiveness: level and extent of {{health services}} for children; and (5) financing, or how families with children are supported by different principles of financing. The conclusion is that the health insurance systems of Austria and especially Germany take health needs of children into consideration to a lesser extent than the national health systems of Denmark and Great Britain. Due to the closer doctorpatient relationship, the family doctor principle of the national health systems gives children easier access to the health care system, and does a better job of ensuring that parents make use of preventive health measures for their children. On the other hand, the free choice of doctors in the health insurance systems is not considered helpful for building up a close and trusting doctorpatient relationship. Children are especially dependent on good co-operation between different service providers such as <b>general</b> <b>practitioners,</b> <b>paediatricians,</b> child health visitors and school nurses. Co-ordination and co-operation is easier and more targeted at the health of children when services are organized at the local level as in the Danish municipalities and the British districts, while the systems of Germany and Austria are characterized by a more fragmented organizational structure.

Six weeks after the outbreak a telephone call was made to all <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> and <b>paediatricians</b> to identify patients with ReA. Ten weeks after the outbreak a questionnaire assessing symptoms of ReA was mailed to all parents, and after a period of 4  months <b>paediatricians</b> and <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> were contacted again to search for additional unreported cases of ReA.  RESULTS—Of the 286  children (age range 11  months to 9  years) with diarrhoea and stool cultures positive for Salmonella enteritidis lysotype 8 / 7, not a single case of arthritis was reported over the 4  month period. However, six children (2 %) had arthralgia of various duration (1  day to 6  weeks) with a single recurrence in one child.

40|$|Child abuse can be {{overlooked}} {{as a cause}} of death, particularly in cases in which there is initially no known cause of death and the death remains unexplained. To rectify this serious situation, both the government and member of parliament Arib have developed proposals to amend the procedures found in the Burial and Cremation Act regarding the deaths of minors. The government hopes to promote closer post-mortem examination for those paediatric cases, including sudden infant death syndrome, in which the cause of death remains unexplained by requiring further investigation into the cause of death (the so-called NODO procedure). Arib proposed a bill in May 2006 that would require all deceased minors to be examined by a forensic expert. Arguments against the latter proposal include the unnecessary burden it would place on surviving relatives of children who die of clearly natural causes. At this time, the NODO procedure proposed by the government appears to be the more rational choice.

40|$|SOLE (“Sanità On LinE” – “Health Care On Line”) is the {{integrated}} network of local health units, hospitals, <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> and <b>paediatricians</b> in the Emilia-Romagna region in Italy. Together, these entities constitute {{the physical and}} virtual infrastructure of all patient-centred integrated care services organised by the health actors in the region. The FSE (“Fascicolo Sanitario Elettronico” – Personal Health Record) is a software application which helps to organise, retrieve and manage the clinical history of every citizen in the region. The SOLE/FSE started about 12 years ago as an initiative of Emilia-Romagna's regional government, with an investment of about € 80 million. CUP 2000 S. p. A., an in-house company, was designated {{to be in charge}} of the design, development, maintenance and continuous improvement of the system and the Integrated Care services provided. The SOLE/FSE case addresses the population of the Emilia-Romagna in its entirety and is used by all 3, 700 GPs/paediatricians practicing under the 11 local health units and in the 6 hospital districts of the region. The case focuses on chronic disease management, home care management, and health and social care services integration. JRC. J. 3 -Information Societ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{estimate}} {{prevalence and}} incidence of {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) in paediatric and adult populations in Italy. METHODS: The study {{was carried out in}} Valtrompia, a valley in northern Italy, where a relatively close community lives, in 2009 - 2012. The only referral centre for SLE in the area is the Rheumatology Unit of the University Hospital of Brescia. The ascertainment of SLE cases was performed through the integration of three sources: 1) hospital database; 2) database of the Rheumatology laboratory; 3) database of <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> and <b>general</b> <b>paediatricians</b> practicing in the area. Each patient was evaluated by a rheumatologist for confirmation of SLE classification based on the presence of at least 4 criteria according to the American College of Rheumatology. RESULTS: Forty-four SLE patients (39 females, 89...|$|R
40|$|Lyme borreliosis (LB) is an {{endemic disease}} in adults in Western countries. Although {{children}} {{may also be}} infected, paediatric studies on LB are scarce. This study aims to estimate the incidence of LB among children with a clinical suspicion for Lyme in a tertiary referral center in the Netherlands. Patient chart data on medical history, clinical signs and symptoms, diagnostic test results and diagnoses were collected using standardized case record forms. Patients were categorized based on clinical and laboratory findings using a modified, previously published classification system. We included 325 children, with a median age of 11. 9 years, of whom 61. 8 % were female. LB was diagnosed in 38 (11. 7 %) of the referred children. However, of the 85 patients who were specifically referred to the Lyme clinic, 28 (32. 9 %) were diagnosed with LB. Of the specifically referred Lyme positive patients, eleven (39. 3 %) had a definitive LB diagnosis. Twelve children had a post-treatment LB syndrome (PTLBS). In line with previous reports in adults, only {{a small proportion of}} children referred with a suspicion of LB were diagnosed with definite or probable LB, which illustrates the difficulty in diagnosing LB by the <b>general</b> <b>practitioner</b> or <b>paediatrician</b> in a district hospita...|$|R
