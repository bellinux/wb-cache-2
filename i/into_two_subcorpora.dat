Para cumprir tal objetivo, a pesquisa intenciona {{responder}} aos seguintes questionamentos: (a) qual a freqÃÃncia das estratÃgias de atenuaÃÃo retÃrica utilizadas nas seÃÃes introduÃÃo e conclusÃo? (b) qual a relaÃÃo existente entre o nÃmero de marcas metadiscursivas de atenuaÃÃo retÃrica em cada subcorpus e as caracterÃsticas retÃricas de cada seÃÃo em anÃlise? (c) qual a freqÃÃncia dos itens lÃxico-gramaticais que realizam as marcas metadiscursivas de atenuaÃÃo retÃrica em cada subcorpus. Para tanto, parte-se do pressuposto de que textos pertencentes a um mesmo gÃnero discursivo, porÃm escritos em lÃnguas distintas apresentam diferenÃas retÃricas marcantes. Tais diferenÃas no discurso acadÃmico escrito podem ser descritas pelo uso das marcas de atenuaÃÃo retÃrica como elemento discursivo-pragmÃtico caracterizador de um âmodus dicendiâ de uma determinada Ãrea do conhecimento, no caso, a Medicina. Para a investigaÃÃo dessas marcas de atenuaÃÃo, selecionamos um corpus composto por 120 artigos de pesquisa em Medicina de periÃdicos nacionais e internacionais, coletados, no site de periÃdicos da CAPES, escritos em lÃngua alemÃ e em lÃngua portuguesa. O referido corpus de estudo compÃe-se de: 60 artigos em Medicina escritos em portuguÃs e 60 artigos escritos em lÃngua alemÃ, divididos em dois subcorpora, a saber, Corpus 1 - Medicina AlemÃo, composto por dois subcorpora: (i) Medicina AlemÃo IntroduÃÃo (MAI) e (ii) Medicina-AlemÃo DiscussÃo (MAD), Corpus 2 - Medicina PortuguÃs, com dois subcorpora: (i) Medicina PortuguÃs IntroduÃÃo (MPI) e (ii) Medicina PortuguÃs DiscussÃo (MPD). Na anÃlise e tratamento dos dados, utilizamos os princÃpios metodolÃgicos da LingÃÃstica de Corpus, aplicando seu carÃter instrumental. Para avaliar os dados dessa pesquisa, utilizamos o programa computacional de anÃlise lingÃÃstica, WordSmith Tools (SCOTT, 1997), versÃo 3. 0, as ferramentas Wordlist e o Concord. Para investigar e analisar os usos e as funÃÃes das marcas metadiscursivas de atenuaÃÃo, sob uma perspectiva do Metadiscurso Interacional (HYLAND, 2005) e da RetÃrica Intercultural (CONNOR, 2008), tendo em vista os corpora em anÃlise, propomos um modelo classificatÃrio, em conformidade com as taxonomias propostas por Hyland (2005), Cabrera (2004) e MartÃn-MartÃn (2008). Conforme os resultados, a seÃÃo de discussÃo concentra o maior nÃmero de ocorrÃncias das marcas de atenuaÃÃo retÃrica nas duas lÃnguas, seguida da seÃÃo de introduÃÃo. Ambas apresentam um elevado nÃmero de ocorrÃncias das estratÃgias de indeterminaÃÃo (as expressÃes epistÃmicas, como verbos modais, lexicais, semi-auxiliares) e os adjetivos/advÃrbios modais,) e desagentivaÃÃo (as expressÃes impessoais, voz passiva). A partir desses resultados, conclui-se que os autores tanto em portuguÃs como em alemÃo nos artigos de pesquisa na Medicina fazem uso na mesma proporÃÃo de estratÃgias de atenuaÃÃo para atender aos propÃsitos comunicativos do gÃnero textual-artigo de pesquisa, como tambÃm pela posiÃÃo que ocupam na comunidade acadÃmica e pela relaÃÃo interpessoal que desejam estabelecer com a audiÃncia. Essa pesquisa contribui para minimizar a lacuna existente com relaÃÃo aos estudos sÃcio-retÃricos das marcas metadiscursivas de atenuaÃÃo, sob uma perspectiva contrastiva, em corpora escritos em portuguÃs e alemÃo de artigos acadÃmicos na Medicina. This thesis investigates, from a rhetoric-contrastive perspective, {{the uses}} {{and functions of}} rhetoric mitigation metadiscursive marks (here hedging devices) in research articles produced by Brazilian and German authors and understood as specialized texts (HOFFMANN, 1998), inserted in the expert-expert communicative context (PEARSON, 1998). To achieve this goal, the present study aims at answering the following questions: (a) how often are hedging strategies employed in the introduction and conclusion sections? (b) {{what is the relationship}} between the number of hedges in each subcorpus and the rhetorical characteristics of each analyzed section? (c) how often do the lexico-grammatical items performing the role of hedges appear in each subcorpus? The starting point for the investigation was the assumption that texts belonging to the same genre but written in different languages present striking rhetorical distinctions. Such differences in academic writing can be described by the use of hedges as discourse-pragmatic elements which characterize the "modus dicendi" of a given knowledge area; in the present case, Medicine. A corpus of 120 research articles from national and international medical journals was built, including texts written in German and Portuguese; the articles were collected from the CAPES periodics website. This corpus consists of 60 Medicine articles written in Portuguese and 60 articles written in German, divided <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>subcorpora,</b> namely, Corpus 1 : Medicine-German and Corpus 2 : Medicine-Portuguese. The former is made of two subcorpora, (i) German Medicine Introduction (MAI) and (ii) German Medicine Discussion (MAD); the latter is also subdivided into two parts, (i) Portuguese Medicine Introduction (MPI) and (ii) Portuguese Medicine Discussion (MPD). The data were analyzed and processed in accordance with the Corpus Linguistics methodological principles, in an instrumental application of its methods. The data were treated with the help of a linguistic analysis software called WordSmith Tools (SCOTT, 1997), version 3. 0, especially the Wordlist and Concord tools. In order to investigate and analyze the uses and functions of the hedges, from the Interactional Metadiscourse (HYLAND, 2005) and Intercultural Rhetoric (CONNOR, 2008) perspectives, given the corpora collected, we have proposed a classification model, in accordance with the taxonomies proposed by Hyland (2005), Cabrera (2004) and MartÃn-MartÃn (2008). The results of the analysis have pointed to the occurrence of a largest number of hedges, in both languages, in the discussion section of the articles, followed by the introduction section. Both present a high number of occurrences of indetermination devices (epistemic expressions, such as modal verbs, lexical verbs, semi-auxiliary verbs, and modal adjectives / adverbs) and disagentivization (impersonal expressions, passive voice). We can therefore conclude that the authors of the Medicine research articles, both those in Portuguese and in German, employ the same amount of hedges in order to achieve the communicative purposes of the research paper genre, given the position the authors occupy in the academic community and the interpersonal relationship they wish to establish with the audience. This research contributes to minimize the gap in the studies on hedging under a contrastive perspective, based on corpora of scholarly texts in Portuguese and German in the Medicine area...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{illustrates}} {{the important role}} played by vague expressions in native speaker communicative competence and investigates {{the use of a}} particular type of vague expressions, general extenders - like ‘and so on’, ‘or something’, ‘etcetera’ - in <b>two</b> <b>subcorpora</b> of 62 EU parliamentary debates comprising native English and non-native English. Results show that by far the most frequent general extenders occurring in the <b>two</b> <b>subcorpora</b> are ‘and so on’ and ‘etcetera’, which Overstreet (1999) has found to be typical of formal settings. In keeping with Terraschke and Holmes (2007), who investigated the use of general extenders in conversations, this study shows that general extenders have similar functions in the <b>two</b> <b>subcorpora.</b> From a formal point of view, the form [adjectives + general extender] appears exclusively in the native subcorpus, albeit in three cases, which may indicate a greater conformity to the norm on the part of non-native speakers...|$|R

In any case, we agree to name it instruction/user's manual and we treat it as a unit. This communication presents a research done with the purpose of establishing the rhetorical structure of instruction manuals for household appliances and to contrast the differences in two languages, Spanish and English. With this commitment we have complied a 52 -text bilingual corpus divided <b>into</b> <b>two</b> comparable <b>subcorpora</b> following Sinclair's (1991) and Leech's (1996) ideas on corpus linguistics as well as other scholars. The theoretical framework for this contrastive study is based on macro-linguistics. We have taken the notion of genre to approach the corpus and considered instruction manuals as one more of them. This macro-linguistic perspective is based on Swales (1993), Halliday and Hasan (1989), Werlich (1983) and Bhatia's (1993, 2004) notions. Then, as the communicative process (Shannon, 1948) and the pragmatic relations are similar in every case, {{we have been able to}} preform a rhetoric analysis from a twofold perspective: qualitative and quantitative. On the qualitative side of the analysis, we have determined the prototypical structure, following and adapting Swales model (1993) to the instructional genre, and according to it we have tagged the corpus into moves, steps and sub-steps. On the quantitative side of the analysis, we have looked for the significance of the different moves, steps and sub-steps in numerical terms and percentages. This raw information needs interpretation, and the conclusion will extract it from the differences and similarities in terms of priorities in one language and the other...|$|R

In this article, we discuss its potential for supporting {{the creation of an}} entirely new kind of information resource for public health, viz. MedicalWordNet. This resource is not to be conceived merely as a lexical extension of the original WordNet to medical terminology; indeed, there is already a considerable degree of overlap between WordNet and the vocabulary of medicine. Instead, we propose a new type of repository, consisting of three large collections of (1) medically relevant word forms, structured {{along the lines of the}} existing Princeton WordNet; (2) medically validated propositions, referred to here as medical facts, which will constitute what we shall call MedicalFactNet; and (3) propositions reflecting laypersons’ medical beliefs, which will constitute what we shall call the MedicalBeliefNet. We introduce a methodology for setting up the MedicalWordNet. We then turn to the discussion of research challenges that have to be met to build this new type of information resource. We build a database of sentences relevant to the medical domain. The sentences are generated from WordNet via its relations as well as from medical statements broken down <b>into</b> elementary propositions. <b>Two</b> <b>subcorpora</b> of sentences are distinguished, MedicalBeliefNet and MedicalFactNet. The former is rated for assent by laypersons; the latter for correctness by medical experts. The sentence corpora will be valuable for a variety of applications in information retrieval as well as in research in linguistics and psychology with respect to the study of expert and non-expert beliefs and their linguistic expressions. Our work has to meet several considerable challenges. These include accounting for the distinction between medical experts and laypersons, the social issues of expert-layperson communication in different media, the linguistic aspects of encoding medical knowledge, and the reliability, volume, and emergence of medical knowledge. The work described here has been tested in a small pilot experiment [39] and awaits large-scale implementation...|$|R

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the sociocognitive approach to Terminology pioneered by Temmerman (2000) this paper aims at comparing the use of lexical metaphors in a bilingual comparable corpus of criminal judgments in Spanish and Italian. The objectives of this contrastive study are twofold: on the one hand, to identify differences and similarities in the frequency and typology of some metaphorical expressions used in Spanish and Italian criminal judgments, and, on the other hand, to show the crucial role played by metaphorical thinking in this specific subgenre of judicial texts. The comparable corpus has approximately 480, 000 tokens and is made up by <b>two</b> <b>subcorpora</b> (Spanish and Italian) of judgments delivered by the Supreme Courts in both countries (Tribunal Supremo and Corte di Cassazione). As far as methodology is concerned, corpus analysis was conducted using version 5 of the WordSmith Tools software. First wordlists of the <b>two</b> <b>subcorpora</b> were used to identify keywords, extracted using two reference corpora. Second, KWIC concordances were run to investigate use and typology in greater detail and infer metaphorical uses from collocational information. By concordancing most of the keywords, the existence of linguistic metaphors that realized particular conceptual metaphors was established. Finally, lexical metaphors were classified according to a number of source and target domains. The paper applies this methodology to a select group of metaphorical realizations from both corpora, showing the empirical importance of evidence of metaphorical reasoning influencing the lexicon of the two judicial systems...|$|R

40|$|The present {{research}} aims to investigate, using corpus-based methods, {{the phenomenon of}} simplification in translated, compared to non-translated, Chinese texts. Simplification in translation can be manifested in the following three levels: translated texts tend to display a shorter average sentence length, draw on a more restricted vocabulary and contain a lower information load, than non-translated texts in the same language. The manifestations may be quantified through corpus-based methods of comparative analysis, measuring: 1) mean sentence length; 2) lexical variety with type/token ratio, percentage of high frequency words and percentage of list heads; and 3) information load with lexical density.

By means of text analysis software, analyses were conducted to identify language traits related to source language interference and translation universals.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of tag {{questions}} (TQs) in British English fiction dialogue by making comparisons to spoken conversation. Data has been retrieved from <b>two</b> <b>subcorpora</b> of the British National Corpus (BNC) : a Fiction Subcorpus and the demographic part of the spoken component. More than 2, 500 TQs have been analysed for their formal features and more than 600 TQs also for their pragmatic functions. The results show that declarative tag questions (DecTQs) are underrepresented in fiction dialogue, whereas imperative tag questions (ImpTQs) are overrepresented. Moreover, several differences between the formal features and pragmatic functions of TQs in fiction dialogue and spoken conversation have been reported. In fiction, reporting clauses and comments in the narrative provide the reader with information the author believes the reader needs to interpret the dialogue {{in the way the}} author has intended; hence, fiction dialogue is enriched with information which is useful in the analysis of a linguistic phenomenon such as the TQ. For the functional analysis of TQs, a hierarchical model has been developed and applied. Most DecTQs turn out to be used rhetorically; only a minority are response-eliciting and, in fiction dialogue, a small number also exchange goods and services. The functional patterns for DecTQs are quite different in the <b>two</b> <b>subcorpora.</b> Most rhetorical DecTQs are addressee-oriented in fiction dialogue, but speaker-centred in spoken conversation. Among the response-eliciting DecTQs, there are similar proportions of confirmation-seeking DecTQs, but, in fiction dialogue, there are proportionately more confirmation-demanding DecTQs, and also a few conversation-initiating DecTQs. All ImpTQs exchange goods and services; in fiction dialogue, there is a higher proportion of ImpTQs used as commands, and a lower proportion of ImpTQs providing advice. The distinctive functional patterns for TQs in fiction dialogue seem largely due to the depiction of problems, conflicts and confrontations and an avoidance of conversations on trivial matters. In fiction dialogue, authors utilize the full potential of DecTQs, which results in large formal and functional variation, whereas they tend to prefer the most conventional form of ImpTQs. Differences between the functional patterns of TQs in fiction dialogue and spoken conversation may partly explain the differences in frequencies and formal features...|$|R

40|$|Old French sentential {{negation}} (NEG) {{represents an}} important morphosyntactic change {{that has been}} investigated by {{a large number of}} scholars from different theoretical approaches. From the 12 th to the 14 th (and mainly in the 13 th) century, there are two variants of this variable in competition: NEG with only ne (the older variant) and NEG with ne + pas/mie/point, etc. The research presented in this paper has been motivated by the wish to find relevant factors for this variation in Old French. In order to identify factors of influence on the variable NEG with or without pas, mie and point, we analyse <b>two</b> <b>subcorpora</b> containing <b>two</b> different text types. The choice of the tested factors is rooted both in variational linguistics and in previous studies on Old French negation, implying (extralinguistic) diasystematic factors like diatopic and diastratic ones as well as intralinguistic factors like transitivity of the verb, word order and clause type. Main findings are the probable relevance of clause type and the influence of socially definable (diastratic) groups. Beyond this, the results across the two different text type are predominantly similar, but we found differences as well. This leads us to plead in favour of the importance of considering the factor text type while working on diachronic corpor...|$|R

40|$|This project {{examines}} {{the inventory of}} recurrent word-combinations and formulaic language in corpora of native and non-native English speech, inspired by the ‘corpus-driven recurrent word-combinations’-approach presented in Altenberg (1998) and De Cock (2004). The analysis draws on usage-based theories which considers recurring patterns of language to be reflective of fundamental properties of language competence. It further considers how we may best identify and describe recurring language patterns and their functions in naturally occurring speech, with a particular focus on learner language. The primary source of material for this study is one native speaker corpus, the Louvain Corpus of Native English Conversation (LOCNEC), and <b>two</b> <b>subcorpora</b> of the non-native speaker corpus LINDSEI (the Louvain International Database of Spoken English Interlanguage), which contain speech produced by Swedish and Norwegian advanced learners of English. The study shows some of {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of employing a hypothesis-finding, corpus-driven approach to the identification and description of formulaic language. It confirms the pervasiveness of recurrent language in both native- and non-native speech, and presents quantitative results showing how particular word-combinations are under- and overrepresented in the learner material as compared to the native speaker corpus. The more qualitatively grounded discussion draws on concepts derived from cognitive linguistics in explaining how recurrent patterns of words occur, function and change, and thus aims to position quantitative findings from corpus linguistics within this theoretical framework...|$|R
40|$|Corporate social {{responsibility}} (CSR) has recently become a fashionable {{item on the}} corporate agenda, and a central plank of corporate communication (Goodman, 2000; Christensen, 2002). Traditionally, companies {{have been involved in}} disseminating detailed information about their performance, goals, priorities and developments. Nowadays, however, firms have embarked on more frequent and ambitious initiatives focussed on issues such as sustainability, ethics and CSR (Lantos, 2001; Dahlsrud, 2006), which are commonly ascribed to the public, institutional and not-for-profit sectors. Firms’ pledge of support for economic development, environmental preservation and community welfare has evolved into a promotional strategy adopted in business settings to reinforce actors’ positive image, increase credibility, and gain consumers’ confidence. In the automobile industry two leading companies are exemplars of the integration of long-term social and environmental aspects into their business and (self-) promotional activities, Fiat and Toyota. The aim of the paper is to examine a small database of CSR reports and to identify some of the core sustainability-oriented values. With the support of corpus linguistics tools (Sinclair, 2003, 2004) and the software package WordSmith Tools 4. 0 (Scott, 2004), the <b>two</b> <b>subcorpora</b> of documents published by Fiat and Toyota are analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The study of wordlists, key-words and their phraseological patterns (e. g. environmental, employees, safety, energy, training, recycling, research) highlights some argumentative strategies adopted by the two manufacturers to demonstrate their accountability to stakeholders, and sheds some light on the crucial role played by CSR in corporate communication...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I {{examine whether}} the {{variation}} patterns of haber pluralization (e. g., hubo/hubieron fiestas ‘there was/were parties’) in Peninsular Spanish corroborate the hypothesis elaborated in earlier work that the phenomenon constitutes a competition between two variants of the presentational construction with haber that is constrained by domain-general cognitive constraints on spreading activation. In addition, this paper examines whether haber pluralization is incrementing in frequency in particular Peninsular regions {{and whether or}} not the phenomenon is spreading geographically. To meet these objectives, I analyze a dataset of more than 7, 500 cases of haber + plural NP, which were culled from two publicly available data sources: the Corpus Oral y Sonoro del Español Rural (which represents only rural speakers born before the 1940 s; Fernández-Ordóñez, 2005 -) and Twitter (which represents mainly young and middle-aged speakers). The results of a mixed-effects logistic regression analysis that tests the effects of tense, the absence/presence of negation, typical action- chain position of the noun, the regional origin of the examples, and the data sources support that haber pluralization constitutes a competition between two presentational haber constructions that is constrained by domain-general cognitive constraints on spreading activation. This model also supports that pluralized haber is spreading westward from its epicenters (Valencia, Barcelona, and Murcia), while also incrementing in frequency in northern, eastern and southern Spain. However, its frequency appears to be declining in central Spain. A geographically more detailed, but similar picture is obtained with three generalized additive mixed models that test the effects of geography on the total dataset as well as on each of the <b>two</b> <b>subcorpora.</b> status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study investigating the hypothesis that the recurrent features, or universals, of translated language are primarily the result of a mediation process that is shared among different kinds of mediated language, rather than the particularities of bilingual language processing. The investigation made use of a comparable corpus consisting of a subcorpus of English texts translated from Afrikaans, a subcorpus of comparable edited English texts, and a subcorpus of comparable unedited (and also untranslated) English texts. The frequency and distribution of linguistic features associated with three of the universals of translated language (explicitation, normalisation/conservatism, and simplification) across the three subcorpora were analysed. The study was guided by the hypothesis that the frequency and distribution of linguistic features associated with the universals of translated language would demonstrate similarities in the <b>two</b> <b>subcorpora</b> of mediated text (i. e., the translated and edited subcorpus), as compared to the subcorpus of unmediated text (i. e., the unedited subcorpus). However, the study yields almost no evidence for a mediation effect that is shared by translated and edited language, at least not along the linguistic features investigated. There is, however, evidence for {{what appears to be a}} separate translation-specific effect, which seems likely to be more unconscious, more proceduralised and more related to the linguistic level alone. This offers some support for the hypothesis of universals of translated language that are unique to this kind of text mediation specifically. Furthermore, the findings of the study suggest that editing may involve a different kind of mediation effect altogether, which frequently remains invisible in conventional corpus-based studies comparing translated and non-translated language, and which requires further investigation.

News programmes were collected and orthographically transcribed from TG 1 and TG 5 in Italy at 20 h 00, and BBC 1 at 18 h 00 and ITV 1 at 18 h 30 in the UK from 12 February to 6 April 2007, as part of the IntUne project. Starting from previous studies focusing on the structure of TV news bulletins (Haarman and Lombardo 2009), a specific XML annotation was added to the texts in order to encode metadata relative to source, date, the structure of news stories and speaker information in order to make use of contextual information in the interpretation of linguistic data available through the corpus. The use of comparable corpora provides the means to carry out an analysis of media texts, building models bottom up from data rather than starting from a hypothesis, while still being able to look at the contexts of culture, the environment in which the text was produced, and the context of situation, the immediate environment of the language in use. This enables the researcher to generalise from the data whilst keeping in mind the dangers of making broad assumptions from a single textual context. Bearing these methodological premises in mind we analysed all the occurrences of Europe/Europa in the <b>two</b> <b>subcorpora,</b> highlighting how the term is highly polysemous shifting from a geographical space to a political, historical, and cultural unit. The analysis makes it possible to compare the differing perceptions of Europe reflected in British and Italian TV news programmes...|$|R
