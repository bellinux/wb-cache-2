In November 2011, Stephen Tignor, chief <b>editorial</b> <b>writer</b> for Tennis.com, ranked Federer's 2006 season as the second-greatest season of all time during the Open Era, behind only Rod Laver's Grand Slam year of 1969. Federer won 12 singles titles (the most of any player since John McEnroe in 1984) and had a match record of 92–5 (the most wins since Ivan Lendl in 1982). Federer reached the finals in an astounding 16 of the 17 tournaments he entered during the season.|$|E
5|$|Wade {{has written}} for The New York Times since 1981 as an <b>editorial</b> <b>writer,</b> science editor and a reporter, {{including}} articles supporting the idea of recent human evolution and racial differentiation. His motivation for writing Before the Dawn began during his reporting of genetics, particularly since the sequencing {{of the human genome}} in 2003, as he started to realise how it could be related to the human past. He sought to put all of the recent research of archaeology, paleoanthropology and linguistics together into one narrative revolving around genetics. Before the Dawn was published in hardcover in 2006, and then in an updated paperback in 2007, by the Penguin Group.|$|E

Sullivan's married life, despite the rumors to the contrary, was happy. She never gave up editorial writing but neither did she allow it to interfere with her duties as wife. She generally did her work at her home. A few years after her marriage, Sullivan severed her connection with the Times and became <b>editorial</b> <b>writer</b> on the Chicago Tribune. In 1883, she became associated with the Chicago Herald. The editors, who a few years before had refused to take her on their papers, now clamored for her services.

25|$|In October 2010, The Forward {{reported}} on {{the current state of}} Jews and the level of antisemitism in Sweden. Henrik Bachner, a writer and {{professor of history at the}} University of Lund, stated that members of the Swedish Riksdag have attended anti-Israel rallies where the Israeli flag was burned while the flags of Hamas and Hezbollah were waved, and the rhetoric was often antisemitic—not just anti-Israel. Charles Small, former director of the Yale University Initiative for the Study of Anti-Semitism, stated that “Sweden is a microcosm of contemporary anti-Semitism. It’s a form of acquiescence to radical Islam, which is diametrically opposed to everything Sweden stands for.” Per Gudmundson, chief <b>editorial</b> <b>writer</b> for Svenska Dagbladet and well known for his pro-Israeli stance for decades, has sharply criticised politicians who he says offer “weak excuses” for Muslims accused of antisemitic crimes. “Politicians say these kids are poor and oppressed, and we have made them hate. They are, in effect, saying that the behaviour of these kids is in some way our fault.” Much of the anti-semitism in the country has been attributed to the growing Muslim immigrant population.|$|E

His work at the Tribune came as his fame as a poet was reaching its peak, and one colleague described it as [...] "a liberal education in the delights of intellectual life to sit in intimate companionship with John Hay and watch the play of that well-stored and brilliant mind".

40|$|Bibliography: pages [78]- 83. After 18 {{years of}} steady income growth {{averaging}} 20 percent a year, Ducks Unlimited, Inc., an international waterfowl conservation organization, began experiencing declining growth. Officials believed the decline {{was caused by}} a shrinking base of waterfowl hunters, traditionally the organization's main source of members. Officials concluded that for the organization to grow, it must attract members from the ranks of non-hunting conservationists and women—two audiences that Ducks Unlimited had generally ignored—to its membership banquets held throughout the country. To reach those audiences, the organization sought to increase its public awareness through state, regional and local media. Prior to developing a public relations program aimed at the media, Ducks Unlimited sought to determine, through a survey of <b>editorial</b> <b>writers,</b> the public's knowledge and perception of conservation issues and organizations. The mail survey was conducted using a two-page questionnaire with 13 yes/no or multiple choice questions. The questionnaire was sent to chief <b>editorial</b> <b>writers</b> at 500 randomly selected newspapers with a cover letter. The first questionnaire was followed by a second, two weeks later. There were 202 valid responses. Among the most significant—though not necessarily surprising—findings was that <b>editorial</b> <b>writers</b> believe they have a responsibility to direct public policy and that they should address environmental concerns. Respondents' knowledge of the role of wetlands in the environment was low as was their knowledge of Ducks Unlimited's activities. They did not understand, for example, the important part wetlands play in controlling water pollution. But their willingness to address such issues could improve the chances of a well-designed and properly executed public relations program focused toward <b>editorial</b> <b>writers.</b> M. A.
