25|$|After his 2011 arrest, Jaishankar {{was kept}} at the Parappana Agrahara Central Jail in Bangalore. He {{was sentenced to}} 27 years in prison. At the Bangalore jail, he {{underwent}} treatment for psychiatric problems. On 31 August 2013, the police took Jaishankar to the court in Tumkur near Bangalore. After returning, Jaishankar feigned uneasiness and {{was admitted to the}} hospital within the prison premises. He managed to secure a <b>duplicate</b> <b>key</b> and used it at 2 am on 1 September 2013, when the daily change of guards took place. The police suspected that an insider helped him get the <b>duplicate</b> <b>key.</b> He scaled a 20-foot wall, then walked atop a 15-foot wall and finally scaled the 30-foot high compound wall. He managed to cross the electric fence safely, since it was not functional that night. He reportedly carried with him a bamboo pole balancing on the walls and a bedsheet to serve as a cushion over the glass pieces on the wall top. He was injured during the escape, and drops of blood were found outside the outer wall. He was reportedly wearing a police uniform during his escape. 11 Jail staff, including 3 wardens, 2 jailors and 6 security guards, were suspended following his escape.|$|E
25|$|This message traffic, {{which was}} {{encrypted}} with a one-time pad system, was stored and analyzed in relative secrecy {{by hundreds of}} cryptanalysts over a 40-year period starting in the early 1940s. Due to a serious blunder {{on the part of}} the Soviets, some of this traffic was vulnerable to cryptanalysis. The Soviet company that manufactured the one-time pads produced around 35,000 pages of <b>duplicate</b> <b>key</b> numbers, as a result of pressures brought about by the German advance on Moscow during World War II. The duplication—which undermines the security of a one-time system—was discovered and attempts to lessen its impact were made by sending the duplicates to widely separated users. Despite this, the reuse was detected by cryptologists in the US.|$|E
25|$|Given {{his very}} weak heart, Poirot conceives {{that he must}} end the string of murders by killing Norton. Poirot invites Norton for hot chocolate: at their meeting, he tells Norton what he {{suspects}} and his plan to execute him. Norton, arrogant and self-assured, insists on swapping cups: anticipating this move, Poirot had drugged both cups, knowing {{that he had a}} higher tolerance for a dose that would incapacitate Norton. Poirot moves the sleeping Norton back to his room using the wheelchair: Poirot could walk, one reason he needed a new valet who was unaware of that for this last case. Then, being the same height as Norton, he disguises himself as Norton by removing his wig and false moustache, ruffling up his grey hair, then donning Norton's dressing-gown and walking with a limp. Having Hastings establish that Norton was alive after he left Poirot's room, Poirot shoots Norton, leaves the pistol on the table and locks the room with a <b>duplicate</b> <b>key.</b> Poirot then writes his story, and ceases to take his amyl nitrite heart medicine. He cannot say it was right to commit murder, but on balance he was sure he prevented yet more instigated by Norton. His last wish for Hastings is typical for Poirot, the matchmaker: he suggests that Hastings should pursue Elizabeth Cole.|$|E

40|$|AQF {{protocol}} {{is a novel}} {{approach to}} authenticate queries in wireless sensor networks to avoid that anybody can inject fake queries in to WSN and likewise to avoid modification of legitimate queries by adversary. Because in any sensor network, sensor nodes are distributed in a width geographical area, an adversary can get a physical access to some sensor nodes {{and use them to}} inject some fake queries or to change some of forwarded quires into the network. AQF will use a probabilistic algorithm for finding and stopping illegitimate queries before they can reach to their destination. <b>Duplicate</b> <b>keys</b> between sensor nodes make it a bit easier for adversary to guess and generate a fake query. Because AQF use a random function to assign encryption keys, there is always a possibility to have <b>duplicate</b> <b>keys</b> during generating a query or checking the legitimacy of forwarded queries. Segment base version of AQF which we proposed use a segmentation method to distributed cryptographic keys between sensor nodes instead of using a random way. With this method, there is no chance to have <b>duplicate</b> <b>keys</b> in sensor network. This version has a better performance for detecting fake queries and it does not need more resources in comparison with basic version...|$|R

50|$|A trie {{essentially}} {{represents a}} set of strings or numbers, and a radix sort which uses a trie structure is not necessarily stable, {{which means that the}} original order of <b>duplicate</b> <b>keys</b> is not necessarily preserved, because a set does not contain duplicate elements. Additional information will have to be associated with each key to indicate the population count or original order of any <b>duplicate</b> <b>keys</b> in a trie-based radix sort if keeping track of that information is important for a particular application. It may even be desirable to discard any duplicate strings as the trie creation proceeds if the goal is to find only unique strings in sorted order. Some people sort a list of strings first and then make a separate pass through the sorted list to discard duplicate strings, which can be slower than using a trie to simultaneously sort and discard duplicate strings in one pass.|$|R
