5000|$|The pintail {{shape is}} used to prevent the wheel from coming {{in contact with the}} board (called [...] "wheelbite") while still {{providing}} ample <b>footspace.</b> Pintails are most commonly used with top mounted trucks. They are also good cruising boards.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of the aforementioned designs, including a [...] "double-drop" [...] board, which incorporates both a drop through and drop down pattern. These are preferable for [...] "freeride" [...] as they are extremely low to the ground, which allows for ease of sliding. <b>Footspace</b> is important because there must be enough room on the board for the rider to form an aerodynamic [...] "tuck". Downhill boards are made as stiff as possible to minimize {{the amount of energy}} stored in the deck in order to mitigate wobbling of the board at high speed (known as [...] "speed wobbles").|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, the {{limousine}} {{has been a}} large car with a long wheelbase with a permanent division between driver and passengers. Two or three occasional or jump seats are usually mounted in the ample <b>footspace</b> of the rear compartment of long wheelbase cars, facing forward behind the driver. These seats face forward. They fold into the floor when not in use. In this way, up to five persons can be carried in the aft compartment in comfort, and up to two additional persons carried in the driver's compartment, for a total capacity of seven passengers {{in addition to the}} driver. This type of seat configuration has become less popular in recent funeral trade limousines.The last production limousine, by Cadillac, with forward-facing jump seats was in 1987 (with their Fleetwood Series 75 model), the last Packard in 1954, and the last Lincoln in 1939, though Lincoln has offered limousines through their dealers as special order vehicles at times. Several Lincoln Premier cars were also built, one being owned by Elvis Presley. Vehicles of this type in private use may contain expensive audio players, televisions, video players, and bars, often with refrigerators. The President of the United States has ridden in a variety of types of limousine stretching back to 1899.|$|E
