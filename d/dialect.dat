5|$|Below {{follows a}} {{presentation}} of the Greece runestones based on information collected from the Rundata project, organised according to location. The transcriptions from runic inscriptions into standardised Old Norse are in Old East Norse (OEN), the Swedish and Danish <b>dialect,</b> to facilitate comparison with the inscriptions, while the English translation provided by Rundata give the names in the standard <b>dialect,</b> Old West Norse (OWN), the Icelandic and Norwegian <b>dialect.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Mangalorean Catholic <b>dialect</b> {{is largely}} {{derived from the}} Bardeskaar (North Goan) <b>dialect</b> and bears a good degree of {{intelligibility}} with the modern Bardeskaar <b>dialect</b> (spoken by North Goan Christians, North Goan Hindus, and South Goan Hindus) and to a slightly lesser extent with the standard Konkani <b>dialect.</b> It consequently differs from the <b>dialect</b> spoken by the Goud Saraswat Brahmins in South Canara, which is copiously derived and bears a good degree of intelligibility with the modern Sashtikaar (South Goan) <b>dialect</b> spoken by South Goan Christians and North Canara Konkani Hindus. It is {{much closer to the}} dialects of the Goan Hindus than to that of the Goan Catholics.|$|E
5|$|The Negombo Tamil <b>dialect</b> {{is used by}} bilingual {{fishermen}} in the Negombo area, who otherwise identify themselves as Sinhalese. This <b>dialect</b> has undergone considerable convergence with spoken Sinhala. The Batticaloa Tamil <b>dialect</b> is shared between Tamils, Muslims, Veddhas and Portuguese Burghers in the Eastern Province. Batticaloa Tamil <b>dialect</b> is the most literary of all the spoken dialects of Tamil. It has preserved several ancient features, remaining more consistent with the literary norm, {{while at the same}} time developing a few innovations. It also has its own distinctive vocabulary and retains words that are unique to present-day Malayalam, a Dravidian language from Kerala that originated as a <b>dialect</b> of old Tamil around 9th century CE. The Tamil <b>dialect</b> used by residents of the Trincomalee District has many similarities with the Jaffna Tamil <b>dialect.</b>|$|E

50|$|Unlike the {{traditional}} division of Armenian into two <b>dialects</b> (Western Armenian and Eastern Armenian), he divided Armenian into three main <b>dialects</b> {{based on the}} present and imperfect indicative particles that were used. He called as the -owm (-ում) <b>dialects,</b> -gë (-կը) <b>dialects,</b> and -el (-ել) <b>dialects.</b> The three major <b>dialects</b> were further divided into subdialects. The book {{is one of the}} few reliable sources of Armenian <b>dialects</b> that existed at the time. After the Armenian Genocide, linguists Gevorg Jahukyan, Jos Weitenberg, Bert Vaux and Hrach Martirosyan have extended the understanding of Armenian <b>dialects.</b>|$|R
50|$|The terms Walser and Walliser are geographic; {{there is}} no {{linguistic}} divide. Specific Walser <b>dialects</b> {{can be traced to}} eastern or western <b>dialects</b> of Wallis canton.

5|$|According to the {{religious}} census of 2011, Madurai had 85.8% Hindus, 8.5% Muslims, 5.2% Christians and 0.5% others. Tamil is spoken by most, and the standard <b>dialect</b> is the Madurai Tamil <b>dialect.</b> Saurashtrian is the mother tongue of the Patnūlkarars who migrated from Gujarat in the 16th century CE. Roman Catholics in Madurai are affiliated with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Madurai, while Protestants are affiliated with the Madurai-Ramnad Diocese of the Church of South India.|$|E
5|$|After the Norse occupation, the {{toponymy}} of Orkney {{became almost}} wholly West Norse. The Norse language changed {{into the local}} Norn, which lingered {{until the end of}} the 18th century, when it finally died out. Norn was replaced by the Orcadian <b>dialect</b> of Insular Scots. This <b>dialect</b> is at a low ebb due to the pervasive influences of television, education, and the large number of incomers. However, attempts are being made by some writers and radio presenters to revitalise its use and the distinctive sing-song accent and many <b>dialect</b> words of Norse origin remain in use. The Orcadian word most frequently encountered by visitors is peedie, meaning small, which may be derived from the French petit.|$|E

5|$|Beside {{being the}} capital city of Sarawak, Kuching became a {{business}} and cultural centre for the Malays of Sarawak. The <b>dialect</b> of Malay spoken in Kuching is known as Bahasa Sarawak (Sarawakian Malay Language), which is a subset of the Malay language. The <b>dialect</b> used in Kuching is a little different from the <b>dialect</b> used in Miri. Since the second largest population in the city is made up of Han Chinese, the Chinese language is also commonly used, particularly Hokkien, Hakka and Mandarin Chinese. Almost all residents are able to speak English. A number of special private schools that teach English for expatriates child can be found through the city.|$|E
5|$|English in England can {{be divided}} into four major <b>dialect</b> regions, Southwest English, South East English, Midlands English, and Northern English. Within each of these regions several local subdialects exist: Within the Northern region, there is a {{division}} between the Yorkshire dialects, and the Geordie <b>dialect</b> spoken in Northumbria around Newcastle, and the Lancashire dialects with local urban dialects in Liverpool (Scouse) and Manchester (Mancunian). Having been the centre of Danish occupation during the Viking Invasions, Northern English dialects, particularly the Yorkshire <b>dialect,</b> retain Norse features not found in other English varieties.|$|E

There is a distinctive Brummie accent and <b>dialect.</b>|$|E
5|$|Riley wrote {{gentle and}} romantic poems {{that were not}} in <b>dialect.</b> They {{generally}} consisted of sonnets and were strongly influenced by the works of John Greenleaf Whittier, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Alfred, Lord Tennyson.

5|$|The Halafians {{were the}} {{indigenous}} people of Neolithic northern Syria, who later adopted the southern Ubaidian culture. Contact with the Mesopotamian south increased during the early and middle Northern Uruk period, and southern people moved to Tell Brak in the late Uruk period, forming a colony, which produced a mixed society. The Urukean colony was abandoned by the colonist {{toward the end of}} the fourth millennium BC, leaving the indigenous Tell Brak a much contracted city. The pre-Akkadian kingdom's population was Semitic, and spoke its own East Semitic <b>dialect</b> of the Eblaite language used in Ebla and Mari. The Nagarite <b>dialect</b> is closer to the <b>dialect</b> of Mari rather than that of Ebla.|$|E

In comparison to other Norrland <b>dialects,</b> the Medelpad <b>dialects</b> are relatively uniform. The most important outer isogloss is the one with the Hälsing <b>dialects</b> to the south, which defines the limits of the [...] "vowel balance" [...] characteristic of Norrland <b>dialects.</b> One characteristic that distinguishes the Medelpad <b>dialects</b> (for example, Indal-Liden) from other nearby <b>dialects</b> is the pronunciation of both short and long i and y as the same, the so-called [...] "Viby I". In Borgsjö and Torp, y is pronounced as i, while ö is pronounced closer to e. This trait is also found in the Hälsing <b>dialects</b> and in parts of Härjedalen. Other traits are shared with the Ångermanländ <b>dialects,</b> like the [...] "thick n" [...] sound after long vowels in words such as van ("experienced", [...] "habituated to") and måne ("moon"). In the northernmost pars of Medelpad, the <b>dialects</b> show notable Jamtlandic influence. A characteristic typical for <b>dialects</b> of coastal Medelpad is short u in place of standard ö.|$|R
