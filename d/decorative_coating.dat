25|$|The statues in Hōryū-ji {{serve as}} good {{examples}} of Hakuhō period sculpture; nearly all date to that period. Most are made of wood, with a single block used for the bodies, and separate blocks for secondary elements, such as demons upon which the deity treads, halos, {{and parts of the}} deities' skirts. All were originally painted and gilded, and bear rounder forms with a stronger impact of three-dimensionality than the Asuka period statues of earlier decades. In these aspects and others, they reflect strong stylistic influences from Three Kingdoms of Korea, Tang-dynasty China, and from the stylistic heritage of the Northern Qi and Sui Dynasties which came before. Another group of statues from the same temple show another important development, namely, the first use of lacquer not solely as a protective or <b>decorative</b> <b>coating</b> for statues, but as a material from which accessories, such as a bodhisattva's jewellery, hair ornaments, and hair, might be made, to be attached onto the wooden sculpture.|$|E

50|$|Painterwork accomplishes two things, {{namely the}} {{preservation}} and the coloration {{of the material}} which is painted. The compounds used for painting, taking the word as meaning a thin protective and/or <b>decorative</b> <b>coat,</b> are very numerous, including oil paint of many kinds, distemper, whitewash, tar; but the word paint is usually confined to a mixture of oil and pigment, ground together {{in a process that}} thoroughly coats every small particle of pigment in oil, together with other materials which possess properties necessary to enable the paint to dry hard and with a degree of flexibility and to varying degrees of opacity/translucency. Oil paints are made up of four parts, the base, the vehicle, the solvent and the driers. Pigment may be added to these to obtain a paint of any desired color. There are several bases for oil paint, those most commonly used for building work being white lead, red lead, zinc white and iron oxide.|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, medium density {{fibreboard}} (MDF) composite wood is {{more and}} more used in the furniture industry to replace bulk wood such as oak, beech, etc. Indeed, this material presents good mechanical properties, is easy to machine, homogeneous, exists in different dimensions (thickness, etc.), is cheaper than bulk wood and finally can be covered by an adhesive <b>decorative</b> <b>coat.</b> Nevertheless, even if this material is homogeneous, it is abrasive enough to tend to the breakdown of the conventional carbide tools employed during its routing process. That is why it is necessary to improve the wear resistance of these tools. One solution is to protect them with a hard coating. The present study deals with the development of ternary CrAlN hard layers obtained by PVD method on carbide tools employed in second transformation of wood. CrAlN coatings have been optimized and then applied on carbide tools in routing of three types of MDF: standard, waterproof and fireproof. The aim of these wood machining tests was first to define the ability to be machined of the three kinds of MDF and second to compare the effectiveness of CrAlN coatings during the routing tests of these material...|$|R

50|$|A typical {{hexavalent}} chromium plating process is: (1) activation bath, (2) chromium bath, (3) rinse, and (4) rinse. The activation bath is typically {{a tank of}} chromic acid with a reverse current run through it. This etches the work-piece surface and removes any scale. In some cases the activation step {{is done in the}} chromium bath. The chromium bath is a mixture of chromium trioxide (CrO3) and sulfuric acid (sulfate, SO4), the ratio of which varies greatly between 75:1 to 250:1 by weight. This results in an extremely acidic bath (pH 0). The temperature and current density in the bath affect the brightness and final coverage. For <b>decorative</b> <b>coating</b> the temperature ranges from 35 to 45 C, but for hard coating it ranges from 50 to 65 C. Temperature is also dependent on the current density, because a higher current density requires a higher temperature. Finally, the whole bath is agitated to keep the temperature steady and achieve a uniform deposition.|$|E

50|$|The theater sits on {{the site}} of an ancient (3rd century BC) Ionic temple portico, which was {{destroyed}} by Hannibal in 217 BC. The temple, measuring 22 by 35 m, lies behind the amphitheater. Today, the only structures remaining are the base (podium) and the eight columns that rose in front. The columns were topped with Corinthian order capitals., and had clad pottery decorated in the back with three segments paved with fine mosaics. Each of the mosaics were dedicated to different deities. The roof was built with trusses, stringers, plates and tiles, each weighing 52 kg, from Venafro. Cells and columns made up its foundations, so the mighty outer wall of the podium served as a simple <b>decorative</b> <b>coating.</b> Elaborate cornices decorated with floral motifs and ram's heads topped the altars. The segments are usually darker than the original, like the steps of the dark sunken staircase. On the left side, an inscription in Oscan recalls Statius Claro, an important figure who built at his expense half of the podium. On the back of the temple, in the containment wall of the ground (north side), a phallic symbol is carved on a block for protection against misfortune. At the sides of the podium, two porches with remains of buildings used as shops and various services complement the overall harmony.|$|E

50|$|Many of the {{artefacts}} {{from this}} expedition {{can be found}} in the British Museum's collection. After this Lubaantun was neglected by archeologists (although it suffered some looting by treasure hunters) until 1970, when a joint British Museum, Harvard, and Cambridge University project was begun led by archaeologist Norman Hammond. Norman Hammond, Kate Pretty, and Frank P. Saul excavated the site in the 1970s. Their research team, in congruence with Sharer and Traxler, believed that the site was founded in the Late Classic period as opposed to the Early Classic, suggested by Joyce. In addition, they postulated that the site saw no Postclassic reoccupation and considered it to be abandoned until the site’s later discovery. They also discuss how Lubaantun has been subject to various looting activities. Their excavations primarily dealt with one Maya family tomb. Various problems were associated with their excavation, including water damage and collapsed masonry walls. Unlike prior surveys, their team found pottery vessels which may have been painted at one point but time has since faded their <b>decorative</b> <b>coating.</b> Hammond's team also found skeletal remains that were also badly damaged by water, but tooth preservation remained relatively good. The disposition of the skulls and bones are consistent with the Maya’s tendency to repurpose tombs, and bury multiple remains in one area. Saul reported that the tomb contained 15 adults, both male and female of various young and middle adult ages. All of the individuals had cavities except for one individual and virtually all of the remains indicate malnutrition occurred in early childhood.|$|E

40|$|Metal-flake powder {{coatings}} are a special class of metallic paint finishes {{composed of two}} superimposed layers: a pigmented <b>decorative</b> base <b>coat</b> and an overlaying transparent protective top coat. In the present investigation, a novel curing procedure for such bilayer coatings is proposed. Flash IR pre-curing of the base coat promotes {{the formation of a}} surface diffusion barrier and limits movement of the decorative pigments and metal flakes around their initial positions. Oven baking after deposition of the top coat then completes curing of the bilayer coating. The influence of the IR intensity and irradiation time on the final properties of bilayer coatings was investigated. The visual appearance, surface morphology and scratch resistance were evaluated. Experimental findings revealed that the hybrid IR/oven baking curing procedure is a viable method for obtaining bilayer {{powder coatings}} with outstanding properties in a shorter processing time and with considerable energy savings. © 2011 Elsevier B.
