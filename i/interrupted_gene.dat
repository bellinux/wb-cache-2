40|$|Sequenced genomes often reveal {{interrupted}} coding sequences that {{complicate the}} annotation {{process and the}} subsequent functional characterization of the genes. In the past, <b>interrupted</b> <b>genes</b> were {{generally considered to be}} the result of sequencing errors or pseudogenes, that is, gene remnants with little or no biological importance. However, recent lines of evidence support the hypothesis that these coding sequences can be functional; thus, it is crucial to understand whether <b>interrupted</b> <b>genes</b> are expressed in vivo. We addressed this issue by experimentally demonstrating the existence of functional disrupted genes in archaeal genomes. We discovered previously unknown disrupted <b>genes</b> that have <b>interrupted</b> homologues in distantly related species of archaea. The combination of a RTPCR strategy with shotgun proteomics demonstrates that <b>interrupted</b> <b>genes</b> in the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus are expressed in vivo. In addition, the sequence of the peptides determined by LCMSMS and experiments of in vitro translation allows us to identify a gene expressed by programmed - 1 frameshifting. Our findings will enable an accurate reinterpretation of archaeal <b>interrupted</b> <b>genes</b> shedding light on their function and on archaeal genome evolution...|$|R
40|$|A {{derivative}} of Tn 917 was constructed, {{referred to as}} Tn 917 -lac, which is capable of generating fusions that connect the transcripts of Bacillus subtilis chromosomal genes to the coding sequence of the lacZ gene of Escherichia coli. Two independent insertions of Tn 917 -lac into the gltA gene and one insertion into the trpE gene (in the trpEDCFBA operon) of B. subtilis were studied in detail, and the results confirmed that Tn 917 -lac-mediated transcriptional fusions produce levels of beta-galactosidase that reflect accurately the regulated expression of <b>interrupted</b> <b>genes.</b> To facilitate these studies, a procedure was developed that permits the analysis of Tn 917 -lac-mediated fusions in partial diploids where insertional mutations are complemented by an intact copy of the <b>interrupted</b> <b>genes.</b> Tn 917 is known to function efficiently in bacteria representing three quite different Gram-positive genera (Streptococcus, Bacillus, and Staphylococcus) and is known to display a relatively high degree of randomness in its insertions into bacterial genomes, making it likely that Tn 917 -lac will be useful for the identification and study of many kinds of regulated genes {{in a wide range}} of Gram-positive species...|$|R

Before the match a video was aired showing that in the weeks prior to SummerSlam, members of The Heenan Family including Haku and André the Giant had attempted to take the Warrior 'out' {{in order to help}} Rude keep his title. The Warrior gained the early advantage {{in the beginning of the}} contest by press slamming Rude from the ring onto the arena's floor, where he followed him and continued the assault, including hitting Rude with the IC belt. He continued to have the advantage until Rude was able to thwart an offensive maneuver by pushing The Warrior from the top rope onto the turnbuckle. The two wrestlers swapped the offensive position until Roddy Piper came down to ringside to distract Rude by flipping up his Kilt and showing Rude his bare ass (though in reality Piper was wearing a jockstrap). This allowed The Warrior to perform a German suplex, press slam, and a Warrior Splash. The Warrior then pinned Rude to become the new Intercontinental Champion. Following the match, commentator Jesse Ventura claimed that the Warrior should cut the belt in half and give the rest to Piper. Heenan and Rude also stormed into the backstage interview area and <b>interrupted</b> <b>Gene</b> Okerlund's interview with Ron Garvin.

40|$|Chromosomal rearrangements in Xq are {{frequently}} associated to premature ovarian failure (POF) and {{have contributed to}} define a POF "critical region" from Xq 13. 3 to Xq 26. Search for X-linked genes responsible for the phenotype has been elusive as most rearrangements did not <b>interrupt</b> <b>genes</b> and many were mapped to gene deserts. We now report that ovary-expressed genes flanked autosomal breakpoints in four POF cases analyzed whose X chromosome breakpoints <b>interrupted</b> a <b>gene</b> poor region in Xq 21, where no ovary-expressed candidate genes could be found. We also show that the global down regulation in the oocyte and up regulation in the ovary of X-linked genes compared to the autosomes is mainly due to genes in the POF "critical region". We thus propose that POF, in X;autosome balanced translocations, may not only be caused by haploinsufficiency, but also by a oocyte-specific position effect on autosomal genes, dependent on dosage compensation mechanisms operating on the active X chromosome in mammals. © Springer-Verlag 2007...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{presence}} of mammary glands distinguishes mammals from other organisms. Despite significant advances {{in defining the}} signaling pathways responsible for mammary gland development in mice, our understanding of human mammary gland development remains rudimentary. Here, we identified a woman with bilateral amastia, ectodermal dysplasia and unilateral renal agenesis. She {{was found to have}} a chromosomal balanced translocation, 46,XX,t(1; 20) (p 34. 1;q 13. 13). In addition to characterization of her clinical and cytogenetic features, we successfully identified the <b>interrupted</b> <b>gene</b> and studied its consequences. Methods Characterization of the breakpoints was performed by molecular cytogenetic techniques. The <b>interrupted</b> <b>gene</b> was further analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting. Mutation analysis and high-density SNP array were carried out in order to find a pathogenic mutation. Allele segregations were obtained by haplotype analysis. Results We enabled to identify its breakpoint on chromosome 1 interrupting the protein tyrosine receptor type F gene (PTPRF). While the patient's mother and sisters also harbored the translocated chromosome, their non-translocated chromosomes 1 were {{different from that of the}} patient. Although a definite pathogenic mutation on the paternal allele could not be identified, PTPRF 's RNA and protein of the patient were significantly less than those of her unaffected family members. Conclusions Although ptprf has been shown to involve in murine mammary gland development, no evidence has incorporated PTPRF in human organ development. We, for the first time, demonstrated the possible association of PTPRF with syndromic amastia, making it a prime candidate to investigate for its spatial and temporal roles in human breast development. </p...|$|E

A restriction map of the gnd locus was prepared by Southern analysis using the Escherichia coli gene as a heterologous probe. The Synechococcus strain R 2 gene was genetically tagged by restriction site-specific insertion of the nptII gene of Tn 903 into a pUC 19 plasmid library of Synechococcus strain R 2 chromosomal DNA. Synechococcus strain R 2 was transformed with this insertion mutation library, and isolates carrying the gnd::nptII gene were identified as mutants hypersensitive to incubation in the dark. The <b>interrupted</b> <b>gene</b> was cloned from one of the mutants. A plasmid carrying the gnd::nptII gene was reintroduced into Synechococcus strain R 2, and kanamycin-resistant transformants were selected. Transformants arising by gene replacement were dark sensitive and missing 6 PGD activity. Transformants arising by plasmid insertion were dark resistant and had 6 PGD activity. The wild-type gene was then cloned from a transformant containing a plasmid insertion, making use of the restriction map derived from the <b>interrupted</b> <b>gene.</b> Synechococcus strain R 2 6 PGD was expressed in E. coli when the cloned gnd gene was transcribed from the lacZ promoter resident on the vector. The boundaries of the gene and the direction of transcription were determined from the phenotypes conferred by plasmids carrying deletions entering gnd from either end.

The experiments reported here were designed to test the hypothesis that in cells infected with γ 134. 5 −mutant the total shutoff of protein synthesis reflects the failure to alter the function ofvhsmade late in infection. Hence, double mutants,vhs−and γ 134. 5 −should not cause total shutoff of protein synthesis. The mutants constructed to test the hypothesis were (i) viruses lacking 1 kbp from the coding domain of γ 134. 5 and carryinglacZ inserted into the coding domain of UL 41, (ii) viruses with deletions in γ 134. 5 genes, (iii) viruses withlacZ inserted into UL 41, and (iv) viruses in which the sequences of the deleted or <b>interrupted</b> <b>genes</b> were restored.
