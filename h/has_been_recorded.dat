5|$|Across {{northern}} Australia, Banksia dentata <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>recorded</b> as {{far west}} as the King Leopold Ranges {{in the western}} Kimberley through the Northern Territory and extending south to Katherine Gorge and into Queensland, where it is found on the Cape York Peninsula to {{as far south as}} Cooktown.

It is the only Banksia species not endemic to Australia. As much of its range is in remote and poorly surveyed country, it is possible that it is found more widely than <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>recorded.</b> Pollen samples indicate it has been present on the Torres Strait Islands over the past 8000 years, though it has not been a prominent component of the island flora.|$|E
