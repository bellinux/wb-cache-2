5|$|For example, {{take the}} fictitious pair Irma Maes and Jef Jacobs {{as shown in}} the table. The first {{stimulus}} is A and U: the last letter of Irma's first name and a letter not in her name. The next stimulus is M and D: the penultimate letter from Irma's first name and a letter not part of her name. As {{can be seen in the}} table this is repeated for the remaining letters of Irma's first name. The letters of her last name then also appear in reverse order, and finally the letters of both of Jef's names. The shading in the table reveals the pattern hidden to subjects, who would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> circle their preferred letter of each pair as fast as possible without thinking.|$|E

500|$|In {{a review}} for New Scientist, Rob Edwards states that Walker {{provides}} a lucid {{account of the}} Three Mile Island accident, which is [...] "riveting because of its detail". It gives a graphic insight into the chaos and confusion of the five-day crisis, and shows how the nuclear industry, the regulators and the government all [...] "initially played down the risks, then had to eat their words". Some 144,000 people were evacuated, but Walker points out that [...] "if {{the full extent of}} the core meltdown had been known at the time, hundreds of thousands more would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> go". Edwards says a [...] "catastrophe was avoided — but only by luck".|$|E
500|$|Cowell had preliminarily {{agreed to}} sign Talbot {{with his own}} record label, Sony BMG. After {{recording}} two songs in London with Talbot ("Over the Rainbow" [...] and [...] "Smile"), the label {{pulled out of the}} deal. Talbot's mother, Sharon, said she was told that her daughter [...] "...was too young to be their sort of artist", adding [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> look for a company which looks after children." [...] In a statement, the label said [...] "there was some deliberation over the possibility of recording with Connie... However, the decision not to proceed was made with the best intentions for Connie, taking into consideration her age and {{that it would not be}} right to do so at this time." [...] Cowell himself said that [...] "when the time is right, [...] be delighted to see if [...] make it work". The Talbot family decided to search for another label, saying [...] "while [...] loves what she's doing it would be cruel to stop her. Fame and money will never matter." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1896 or 1897, Westcott broke all {{ties to the}} Golden Dawn, leaving Mathers in control.

[...] Apparently, when the papers were found, Westcott's connection to the Golden Dawn was discovered and {{brought to the attention}} of his employers. He may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> either resign from the Order or to give up his occupation as coroner.

2500|$|The {{character}} Josie {{has been}} described as [...] "well-groomed...confident" [...] and someone who [...] "set high — if not impossible — standards, and inevitably people failed her." [...] She had few central storylines of her own, and in November 1999, it was reported that Matthew Robinson was axing the character. According to a report in the Daily Mirror, actress Joan Hooley was called into Robinson's office [...] "and told her services would no longer be required." [...] An insider is quoted as saying, [...] "The writers <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> start thinking of ways to get rid of Josie. Obviously Joan was shocked, but the powers- that-be just didn't think it was working out." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Japanese {{government}} {{estimates the}} total amount of radioactivity released into the atmosphere was approximately one-tenth as much as was released during the Chernobyl disaster. Significant amounts of radioactive material have also been released into ground and ocean waters. Measurements taken by the Japanese government 30–50km from the plant showed caesium-137 levels high enough to cause concern, leading the government to ban the sale of food grown in the area. Tokyo officials temporarily recommended that tap water should not be used to prepare food for infants. In May 2012, TEPCO reported that at least 900 PBq had been released [...] "into the atmosphere in March last year [...] alone" [...] although it has been said staff may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> lie, and give false readings to try and cover up true levels of radiation.|$|E
