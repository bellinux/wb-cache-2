500|$|During the season, Scott {{played in}} 12 of 13games, {{including}} 11starts, and recorded 1,133rushing yards and eight touchdowns. In {{the first game}} of the 2008 season against Delaware, Scott ran for 197yards in his first career start, which was enough to place sixteenth on the list for school all-time single-game rushing. The following week, underdog Middle Tennessee stunned Maryland, 24–14, but Scott set the game-high for rushing with 123yards. He tallied his career-first rushing touchdown with a 63-yard run on the second play of the game. Scott [...] "dominated early" [...] against 23rd-ranked California with 19carries for 87yards and two touchdowns, but in the third quarter, he suffered a game-ending shoulder injury. His first-half effort helped Maryland take a quick lead and eventually upset California, 35–27. Scott sat out the next game against Eastern Michigan, but returned for the road game at 20th-ranked Clemson. Scott made 23carries but gained only 39yards, a mark that was surpassed by receiver Heyward-Bey on one reverse that gained 76yards to spark a second-half comeback. Head coach Friedgen said:"I told Da'Rel he needed to run a little more north–south. Clemson has such good team speed. If you go east–west on them, you're not going to go very far. I thought he had a couple runs when he tried to bounce it outside. Normally, Da'Rel can do that. Not against this team... I told him this is a game where three yards is a good running play... I don't know if Da'Rel has been in a game like this, playing the whole game that way in a tough environment. He came out in the second half and said 'I'm going to go, coach.' He patted me on the butt. 'Just <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> ball.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{anniversary of}} the game was not widely commemorated until its silver anniversary in 1987. By that time, the NBA had grown to be a popular sports league with average {{attendance}} of 13,000 fans per game and star players like Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and Michael Jordan. The Warriors' PR director Harvey Pollack said an impossible 40,000 people claimed to have seen the game, and some even testified it took place in Madison Square Garden. Chamberlain later stated {{it was one of}} his favorite games, but not the favorite: that title belonged to the match in which he grabbed an NBA record 55 rebounds against perennial rival Bill Russell. He did not want to feed the criticism that he was more interested in personal stardom than winning. Although Chamberlain won two NBA championships and was the NBA's all-time leading scorer and rebounder when he retired, he was mostly remembered as the man who had single-handedly scored 100 points in a game. Chamberlain publicly embraced the 100-point game in his final years. On a radio show commemorating the game's 31st anniversary in 1993, he said, [...] "As time goes by, I feel more a part of that 100-point game." [...] He explained that growing up on the streets, he would have been derisively labelled a gunner, a glory-hound, for attempting 63shots. [...] "You take that many shots on the playground, and no one ever wants you on their team again." [...] He said he took shots he normally would not, noting that in contests which he considered to be better he scored 50 to 60 points on around 75 percent shooting, as opposed to his 57 percent shooting in the 100-point game. He was proud that people who knew nothing about basketball would point out the game to their kids when they saw him. [...] "I know that it has been my tag. I am definitely proud of it. But it was definitely a team effort. You had {{to see some of the}} things my teammates did to <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> ball ... It was almost like a circus out there for a while." ...|$|E

2500|$|With Lawry's {{defensive}} leadership {{under heavy}} fire he was dropped {{along with three}} other players, becoming the first Australian captain to be dropped {{in the middle of}} a series. He was not informed privately by the Board and only found out after his axing was made public. The Australian selectors Don Bradman, Sam Loxton and Neil Harvey delayed the announcement while they tried to locate Lawry at the end of the Sixth Test, but he had already left for his home in Melbourne and they were unable to find him. He first heard the news on the radio and the selectors were much maligned in the press as a result. Lawry never played for Australia again despite being only 33 and averaging 47.15, but began his 40-year career as a commentator in the Seventh Test, saying [...] "Well, I suppose we all have to get around to it some day". Two days earlier, after lengthy discussion, the ACB had voted 7–6 to acknowledge and respond to Lawry's letter following the South African tour, although their reply did not address Lawry's concerns. His successor Chappell condemned the Board's actions as [...] "unbelievable". Immediately after his appointment, the new leader told his wife [...] "The bastards won't <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> way they got Bill", and he later went out on his own terms. Victorian and Australian teammate Paul Sheahan said [...] "The fact that no-one had the courage to tell him he was to lose his job as Australian captain was disgraceful." [...] At the same time, Sheahan said that Lawry was [...] "a bit of an autocrat" [...] and [...] "not the sort of captain who stood alongside you and drew the best out of you." ...|$|E
