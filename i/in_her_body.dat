5|$|A second {{victim is}} found, {{this time a}} man whose eyes have been removed by forced surgery. Again, they {{discover}} the eyes were obtained from organ donation, and they find a connection to a woman called Amanda (Anja Savcic), a ballerina who had committed suicide. They also note the care that the culprit performed the work, and speculate that the person {{they are looking for}} is showing some compassion for his victims, calling for emergency help and using the serum to hope that they are given the proper care in time. They find that Amanda's alleged cremated remains are bogus, and that her body had been stolen before it could be cremated. They start to trace connections to Amanda, finding she was in a depression counseling support group. Though there are several possible suspects, Olivia's intuition leads her to a man named Roland David Barrett (Mark Ivanir), who was noted to have become enamored with Amanda at the meetings. At Roland's home, he has recovered the corpse and surgically replaced the organs <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>body.</b> Using a makeshift set of ropes and pulleys, Roland engages Amanda's body in a marionette act to make her perform like a ballerina, promising her he will bring her back to life.|$|E
5|$|At the marabout's zawiya, Eberhardt was {{weakened}} by fever. She returned to Aïn Sefra, and was treated {{at the military}} hospital. She left the hospital against medical advice and asked Ehnni, from whom she had been separated for several months, to join her. Reunited on 20October 1904, they rented a small mud house. The following day, a flash flood struck the area. As soon as the waters subsided, Lyautey launched a search for her. Ehnni was discovered almost immediately, saying that Eberhardt had been swept away by the water. Based on this information, Lyautey and his men searched the surrounding area for several days before deciding to explore {{the ruins of the}} house the couple had stayed <b>in.</b> <b>Her</b> <b>body</b> was crushed under one of the house's supporting beams. The exact circumstances of her death were never discovered. While some biographers have raised suspicions regarding Ehnni, most believe it more likely that Eberhardt, who had always believed she would die young, instead accepted her fate. Mackworth speculated that after initially trying to run from the floodwaters, Eberhardt instead turned back to face them. Blanch argued that due to Eberhardt's history of suicidal tendencies, she probably would have still chosen to stay in the area even if she had known the flood was coming. Lyautey buried Eberhardt in Aïn Sefra and had a marble tombstone, engraved with her adopted name in Arabic and her birth name in French, placed on her grave.|$|E

5|$|While {{willing to}} accept his death and allow Momohime her {{remaining}} time <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>body,</b> Kongiku shows them another way to Heaven. There, Yukinojo appears and reveals {{that he had the}} Dark Resurrection all along. They are then attacked by Fudo-Myoou, who is there to deliver divine justice upon Jinkuro. In the first ending, Jinkuro allows himself to be sent to Yomi while Momohime lives; she decides to forgo her marriage to Yukinojo and become a Buddhist nun in the hope of saving Jinkuro's soul through prayer. In the second ending, Momohime and Jinkuro are intercepted by Kisuke and Yuzuruha, resulting in Kongiku being robbed of her human form as punishment for her defiance. Though defeated, Kisuke delivers a fatal wound to Momohime, forcing Jinkuro to merge his soul with Momohime's to save her: this act leaves her an amnesiac but grants her Jinkuro's sword fighting abilities, which become legendary as she travels Japan in search of her missing memories. In the third ending, after the battle with Fudo-Myoou Jinkuro is transported to the night he first attacked Yukinojo and Momohime with the power of the Oboro Muramasa Demon Blade, which can defy the passage of fate. He chooses not to attack them, then later possesses Yukinojo's body and uses that position to ensure Momohime's safety and her family's security. Momohime herself lives to be one hundred years old and bears three children, while Kongiku remains close to Jinkuro {{in the guise of a}} servant.|$|E

40|$|In this. study, we {{attempted}} to test whether tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the first ratelimiting enzyme of catecholamine synthesis, is confined to the perikarya of activated magnocellular vasopressinergic (VPergic) neurons or is also present in their distal axons in the pituitary posterior lobe (PL). In addition, we evaluated the possible correlation between TH and VP turnover in the axons of rats drinking 2 % NaCl for 1, 2, and 3 weeks. To this aim, we examined the large swellings of VPergic axons, the so-called <b>Herring</b> <b>bodies,</b> using the doubleimmunofluorescent technique and the avidinbiotin technique, combined with image analysis. Here we have demonstrated {{for the first time}} a colocalization of TH and VP <b>in</b> <b>Herring</b> <b>bodies,</b> which is a strong argument in favor of TH transport from the perikarya of VPergic neurons via axons toward their terminals. THimmunoreactive (IR) and VP-IR materials were distributed <b>in</b> <b>Herring</b> <b>bodies</b> with seeming zonality. The number of VP-IR <b>Herring</b> <b>bodies</b> decreased by a factor of four over the first week of osmotic stimulation, remaining at almost the same low level until the end of the experiment. Conversely, the content of the VP-IR material within the individual <b>Herring</b> <b>bodies</b> fell gradually during the three weeks of saltloading. The results suggest that VP depletion from <b>Herring</b> <b>bodies</b> prevails <b>in</b> its transport into these structures during the whole period of osmotic stimulation. In contrast to VP-IR <b>Herring</b> <b>bodies,</b> the number of TH-IR <b>Herring</b> <b>bodies</b> and the content of TH-IR material within the individual <b>Herring</b> <b>bodies</b> increased progressively during the entire experiment. The synchronization of the VP depletion and TH accumulation <b>in</b> <b>Herring</b> <b>bodies</b> during longterm osmotic stimulation raised the question about a possible functional interaction between both substances...|$|R

25|$|Harlow's {{kidney failure}} {{could not have}} been cured in the 1930s. The death rate from acute kidney failure has {{decreased}} to 25% only after the advent of antibiotics, dialysis, and kidney transplantation. Harlow's grey complexion, recurring illnesses, and severe sunburn were signs of the disease, as her kidneys had been slowly failing and toxins accumulated <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>body,</b> exposing her to other illnesses and causing symptoms including swelling, fatigue, and lack of appetite. Toxins also adversely affected her brain and central nervous system. Speculation has suggested that Harlow suffered a poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, following scarlet fever when she was young, which may have caused high blood pressure and ultimately kidney failure.|$|E

25|$|The Bene Gesserit {{develop their}} {{physical}} abilities {{as well as}} their mental abilities. A trained Sister has full control over each muscle <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>body</b> through training known as prana-bindu. This allows her to bend the last joint in her little toe while remaining otherwise motionless, bend and contort her body in ways that most would consider impossible, or put a remarkable amount of force behind a physical blow. The mental part of prana-bindu, or prana-nervature (prana stands for breath, bindu stands for musculature) is the precise control of the totality of nerves in the human body. In Dune, Reverend Mother Mohiam tests Paul with a nerve induction device ("the box") that causes the sensation of intense pain. Paul learns that he {{is not the only one}} to have tried it, but is perhaps specially resistant; this conversation points to a widespread use of it as a tool among the Bene Gesserit to measure self control, nerve control, and as Mohiam puts it, crisis and observation.|$|E

Diana joins the Star Division and helps them repel an attack by Yumedono, a vain woman who wants to engulf New York in insects. After losing a duel with Subaru, Shinjiro is forced to perform on stage as a new star called Peppermint. Subaru questions why Shinjiro is able to succeed even though he is flawed. Subaru opens herself up to the group eventually recognizing everyone's importance in her life, including Shinjiro's. The Star Division repels an attack led by Tsugarubi, who resents women and steals their life essence turning them into stone.

500|$|The Los Angeles County Coroners Office was {{assisted}} in their investigation by psychiatrists from the Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Team, who had expert knowledge on suicide [...] It was estimated that Monroe had died between 8:30 and 10:30p.m., and the toxicology report later {{revealed that the}} cause of death was acute barbiturate poisoning. She had 8mg% (milligrams per 100 milliliters of solution) chloral hydrate and 4.5mg% of pentobarbital (Nembutal) in her blood, and a further 13mg% of pentobarbital in her liver. Empty bottles containing these medicines were found next to her bed.

Leigh had neck fingertip pressure injuries, indicating she had been choked before she died, though this was not the {{cause of death}}. Leigh's blood alcohol reading was 0.128, a level which, according to the University of Notre Dame, would have caused [...] "significant impairment of motor coordination and loss of good judgment". There was no doubt that Leigh was violently sexually assaulted before she was murdered, and the evidence indicated that prior to the night of her murder she had not had sexual intercourse. Leigh had deep bruising to the left wall of her vagina, extensive bruising to her hymen and two tears, one [...] long, to her vulva. An analysis of the postmortem by Dr Johan Duflou, deputy director of the New South Wales Institute of Forensic Medicine, stated that an inflexible object, possibly a beer bottle, was likely to have caused most of her genital injuries.

500|$|When the exorcists {{are given}} the mission to save General Cross Marian from the Noah clan, she {{believes}} Allen was killed on the journey by her former ally Suman Dark. As she copes with this, Lenalee defeats a Level 3 Akuma attacking her group's ship. She then coaxes more power from her Innocence than she can safely handle, reducing her ability to use her boots {{as well as her}} physical mobility. During this state, her Innocence becomes a crystal to protect her from harm, a behavior unheard of in Innocence. This leads the Millennium Earl to believe that Lenalee might possess the [...] "Great Heart" [...] that both exorcists and the Noah search for as the user of it will win the war. However, the Earl tries to take her, but the exorcist is saved by the returning Allen. The group is then trapped in Noah's Ark where their enemies try to kill the exorcist before the Ark is destroyed. With Cross' help, Allen saves the Ark. After returning to the Black Order, a Level 4 Akuma attacks the HQ, and many people are injured or killed. Lenalee willingly expresses a desire to become an exorcist. Accepting her conviction, the Innocence grants her greater power, becoming a never-before-seen evolved Equipment-type, dubbed a Crystal-type. These new Boots are made up of Lenalee's blood and repair themselves as long as she has blood <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>body.</b> When the Dark Boots are in their dormant state, they form two blood-red anklets.
