[...] Stiglitz explains how the neoclassical, or Walrasian model ("Walrasian economics" [...] refers to the result of the process which has given birth to a formal representation of Adam Smith's notion of the [...] "invisible hand", along the lines put forward by Léon Walras and encapsulated in the <b>general</b> <b>equilibrium</b> <b>model</b> of Arrow–Debreu), may have wrongly encouraged the belief that market socialism could work.

2500|$|While Cass and Shell's 1983 paper [...] {{defined the}} term sunspot {{in the context}} of general equilibrium, their use of the term sunspot (a term {{originally}} used in astronomy) alludes to the earlier econometric work of William Stanley Jevons, who explored the correlation between the degree of sunspot activity and the price of corn. In Jevons' work, uncertainty about sunspots could be considered intrinsic, for example, if sunspots have some demonstrable effect on agricultural productivity, or some other relevant variable. In modern economics, the term does not indicate any relationship with solar phenomena, and is instead used to describe random variables that have no impact on the preferences, allocations, or production technology of a <b>general</b> <b>equilibrium</b> <b>model.</b> The modern theory suggests that such a nonfundamental variable might have an effect on equilibrium outcomes if it influences expectations.|$|E
2500|$|New Keynesian Macreconomics. Dixon {{was one of}} {{the first}} economists to examine the effect of {{imperfect}} competition on the effectiveness of fiscal policy in his paper A simple model of imperfect competition with Walrasian features. This is an idea that was much explored in many other papers by him [...] and more recently. This paper was the first to demonstrate in a simple <b>general</b> <b>equilibrium</b> <b>model</b> that the fiscal multiplier could be increasing with the degree of imperfect competition in the output market. The reason for this is that imperfect competition in the output market tends to reduce the real wage, leading to the household substituting away from consumption towards leisure. When government spending is increased, the corresponding increase in lump-sum taxation causes both leisure and consumption decrease (assuming that they are both a normal good). The greater the degree of imperfect competition in the output market, the lower the real wage and hence the more the reduction falls on leisure (i.e. households work more) and less on consumption. Hence the fiscal multiplier is less than one, but increasing in the degree of imperfect competition in the output market.|$|E
