40|$|This paper {{describes}} the specification, features {{and implementation of}} computer‐aided assessment software designed primarily for conducting assessments in Statistics but equally applicable to other quantitative disciplines. The CAMPUS (Computer Aided Marking Program Using Spreadsheets) package has been developed in Microsoft Excel so as to provide a familiar computing <b>environment</b> for both <b>assessors</b> and students. The principal feature of CAMPUS is the facility for setting questions containing random elements (including random graphs), so that each student sits essentially the same questions but with different answers. This helps to eliminate plagiarism and allows a single test to be used many times, either for reassessment or additional practice. CAMPUS has been implemented in a higher‐education context but {{could also be used}} at school level...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Ecologic {{frameworks}} {{account for}} multilevel {{factors related to}} physical activity (PA) and {{may be used to}} develop effective interventions for women. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the influence of individual, social and environmental factors on PA among African American and Hispanic women using structural equation modeling. Methods: Overweight and obese women (N =  164, 65. 9 % African American) completed a 7 -day accelerometer protocol, a physical assessment, and questionnaires on body image, self-efficacy, motivational readiness, social support, home environment for physical activity and perceived <b>environment.</b> Trained <b>assessors</b> evaluated each participant's neighborhood and collected objective measures of physical activity resources and the pedestrian environment. Assessments were completed between 2006 and 2008. Results: Structural model fit was acceptable (RMSEA = . 030). Body composition and image was negatively associated with PA, and motivational readiness had an indirect effect on PA through body composition and image. PA resources and the pedestrian environment operated through the perceived environment to positively influence neighborhood cohesion, which was positively associated with body composition and image. Conclusion: PA is more heavily influenced by intrapersonal factors related to weight. Improving intrapersonal factors related to weight and perceptions of the environment may lead to increased PA in African American and Hispanic women...|$|R
40|$|Background: In recent years, {{virtual reality}} has been {{introduced}} to neurorehabilitation, in particular {{with the intention of}} improving upper-limb training options and facilitating motor function recovery. Methods/Design: The proposed study incorporates a quantitative part and a qualitative part, termed a mixed-methods approach: (1) a quantitative investigation of the efficacy of virtual reality training compared to conventional therapy in upper-limb motor function are investigated, (2 a) a qualitative investigation of patients’ experiences and expectations of virtual reality training and (2 b) a qualitative investigation of therapists’ experiences using the virtual reality training system in the therapy setting. At three participating clinics, 60 patients at least 6 months after stroke onset will be randomly allocated to an experimental virtual reality group (EG) or to a control group that will receive conventional physiotherapy or occupational therapy (16 sessions, 45 minutes each, over the course of 4 weeks). Using custom data gloves, patients’ finger and arm movements will be displayed in real time on a monitor, and they will move and manipulate objects in various virtual <b>environments.</b> A blinded <b>assessor</b> will test patients’ motor and cognitive performance twice before, once during, and twice after the 4 -week intervention. The primary outcome measure is the Box and Block Test. Secondary outcome measures are the Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Assessments (hand, arm and shoulder pain subscales), the Chedoke-McMaster Arm and Hand Activity Inventory, the Line Bisection Test, the Stroke Impact Scale, the MiniMentalState Examination and the Extended Barthel Index. Semistructured face-to-face interviews will be conducted with patients in the EG after intervention finalization with a focus on the patients’ expectations and experiences regarding the virtual reality training. Therapists’ perspectives on virtual reality training will be reviewed in three focus groups comprising four to six occupational therapists and physiotherapists. Discussion: The interviews will help to gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} phenomena under investigation to provide sound recommendations for the implementation of the virtual reality training system for routine use in neurorehabilitation complementing the quantitative clinical assessments...|$|R
40|$|Consumers now demand {{higher quality}} {{in all aspects}} of life. This has had a {{particular}} effect on the food industry where the need for quality encompasses both food safety and sensory characteristics. The sous vide process was developed to produce food on a large scale but with superior sensory qualities compared to the products of cook-chill and cook-freeze systems. This research aimed to determine whether the sous vide process could produce meals with superior sensory properties as claimed. A literature survey indicated that craft-based assessors (chefs) claimed improved qualities in sous vide products which were not consistently supported by sensory analysts (scientists). Empirical studies were conducted to test whether sous vide and conventionally processed dishes could be distinguished by untrained assessors in a controlled laboratory <b>environment</b> and with <b>assessors</b> in an ecologically valid environment, a restaurant. In the laboratory, the sous vide meals were easily distinguishable from and less acceptable than the conventionally produced dish. In the restaurant, few significant differences were found. Thus the ecologically valid environment of the restaurant where the many extrinsic factors affect consumers' perceptions, effectively masked differences between the sous vide and conventionally prepared meals. To explore the reasons for this, a survey (n 188) was conducted to determine the relative importance of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting the acceptability of foods when eating out. Results included a factor analysis which clearly showed components of 'customer care' had the greatest influence on the pleasure of eating out, followed by 'drink', and the absence of 'entertainment'. The factor which included 'enjoyment of food' was eleventh in the level of influence. Two scales were also devised to assess consumers' attitudes towards complaining about problems with meals and towards the technology used to produce them. This work has demonstrated that although consumers assume that the intrinsic qualities of food are the most important facator giving them pleasure when eating out, many extrinsic factors will have a much greater influence on affecting their overall pleasure from the experience...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{constructs}} {{a spatial}} method to assess a built heritage area, for conservation and tourism, that weaves environmental and cultural considerations together. The spatial method {{was constructed in}} three steps. First, the cultural values that underlay the reasons for conservation and the ideas of quality were identified and named as purpose values and quality values respectively. Reasons associated with traditions were the most common purpose of conservation and the main quality values were story value, authenticity and aesthetics. Second, concepts were formed to categorize data, to assess an area and to assess individual places. Third, a spatial model of environmental assessment was constructed which has two cultural factors of need and knowledge which are brought to the <b>environment</b> by the <b>assessor</b> and two endogenous environmental factors of location and unity. The factor of need implements a purpose value and the factor of knowledge implements those concepts of data and assessment {{that are relevant to}} the need. Two sub-models of time and aesthetics were appended to the model to elaborate the factors of location and unity in an assessment for an historical or aesthetic purpose. The method was used to assess the central commercial area in the historic gold mining city of Charters Towers in north Queensland for two purposes of conservation: a tradition of excellence in achievement and the aesthetic appeal of the outside of the buildings. Next, the model of environmental assessment was used with the contingent valuation survey method in a survey of residents' opinion of the same area and their evaluation of alternative environmental objectives for its conservation. The model's factors provided statistically significant explanations for residents' opinion of the area, their attitude towards a hypothetical heritage authority and their willingness to pay for research and protection of the area. The survey found that residents would pay more {{for the protection of the}} area than for the protection of individual buildings they considered important in the area, but the difference was not statistically significant. The thesis developed four matters of policy to consider after an assessment of an area and before starting an environmental plan for its conservation: the administrative power that is needed to regulate demolition and redevelopment; the administrative principles to use in the preparation of conservation policy; the economic effects of conservation; and design principles for new buildings. The administrative power to conserve a built heritage area was not held by any level of government in Queensland in early 1995. Parts of the research were published in O'Sullivan (1996 a, 1996 b) ...|$|R
