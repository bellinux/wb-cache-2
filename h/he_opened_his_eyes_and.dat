It was just that instead of vanilla they wanted chocolate, and I happened to be chocolate. When I walked in to audition, Marc Cherry was so sweet. He said, 'I hope you don't mind, but I'm going to close my eyes, because I really want to hear how you sound.' When I was done with the audition, <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> this angelic smile crept across his face, and I thought, 'Oh, good. Something went right.'" [...] The actress also explained that she watched the pilot filmed with Lee and while that was helpful for her own portrayal, she saw that what she had to offer for the role was different, saying: [...] "It's a little strange when you watch someone else in a role you're auditioning for because his or her performance lives in your mind. It can be hard to distinguish yourself sometimes, but I had fun with it." [...] Scenes featuring Lee were refilmed with Strong as her replacement. Strong stated years later that her role and narration as Mary Alice led to her voice becoming significantly recognizable, explaining in a 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly that fans of the series would recognize her in coffee shops solely by her voice. The actress served as the narrator of almost every episode of the series, with the exceptions of the third season episode [...] "My Husband, the Pig" [...] (in which Steven Culp narrates the episode as the deceased Rex Van de Kamp) and the fifth season episode [...] "Look Into Their Eyes and You See What They Know" [...] (in which Nicollette Sheridan narrates the episode as the deceased Edie Britt).|$|E
60|$|And <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> {{looked down}} the rifle with a quivering mouth.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and,</b> {{seeing the}} {{room full of}} boys and men, he looked bewildered, then suspicious.|$|E
60|$|They bathed the boy's {{head with}} iced water for some time. Presently <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|In {{a moment}} or two <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>His</b> lips moved, but he was half delirious.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> for {{the first}} time since many months, and {{attended}} to her with respect.|$|R
60|$|But Eric {{was not yet}} gone. <b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> saw {{the death}} of Skallagrim and smiled.|$|E
60|$|The detective {{closed his}} eyes, and smiled his quiet smile again. <b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> fixed them on Mrs. Pett.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> {{rose from}} the sofa, {{accurately}} to an hour from {{the time when he}} had gone to sleep.|$|E
60|$|The Prince was not {{completely}} roused, but <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> a little and looked all the handsomer.|$|R
60|$|Soon {{the cool}} water revived him, and {{presently}} <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{to look in}} questioning surprise at D'Arnot.|$|R
60|$|After the meal, Vane {{fell into}} a restless doze, and it was dark when <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> again.|$|R
6000|$|At first Whopper paid no attention. [...] "Then his {{struggles with}} the bush ceased and <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> stared about him in bewilderment.|$|E
60|$|The wounds were {{washed and}} bound up, some cordial was poured {{between his lips}} and, ere long, <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> looked round, in bewilderment.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> whispered with difficulty, [...] "Forgive you, Maggie? God {{for ever}} bless you." [...] He could say no more, owing to {{excessive}} weakness.|$|E
60|$|The sun {{had cleared}} the redwoods when <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> again and saw Leger smiling down at him.|$|R
60|$|The latter {{fell into}} a restless doze after the meal, and it was dark when <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> again.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> drowsily, and saw an old grey Quatta hare staring drearily {{into his}} face with large {{whitening}} eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> put up one hand. Then he {{struggled}} to his feet, trembling weakly, and his white face smiled into the girl's anxious one.|$|E
60|$|Paxton, Coulter {{and several}} others {{gathered}} around the fallen bully and rubbed his face with some snow. In a few minutes <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> stared around.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he became}} {{conscious}} {{that he was}} being rubbed with hot flannels. <b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> saw a gleaming of moving machinery, and the red glare of furnaces.|$|E
60|$|When next <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> groaned, rolled over, sat up, and yawned, {{the sun was}} {{beginning}} to peep above the eastern sea.|$|R
50|$|Eno {{also claimed}} to have been awoken early every morning with someone shaking <b>his</b> shoulder. When <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> no one was there.|$|R
60|$|Walter {{had been}} placed on a {{swinging}} cot, and now his head was bound up. Before this operation was over <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Wonder if I'm dead?" [...] was {{the first}} idea that {{occurred}} to him as <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> saw a brilliant sky above him, all purple, gold, and red.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hi! who's washing my {{face with}} snow?" [...] cried Tom, as <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> sat up. [...] "That's a mean trick, Dick, on a fellow who is dead tired out." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{came to his}} senses--that is to say, <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> looked vacantly about him--between {{four and}} five hours after {{the time when we}} had found him {{on the floor of the}} workshop.|$|E
60|$|When <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>he</b> {{found that}} his father had hauled him from under the {{wreckage}} and was gazing earnestly into his face.|$|R
60|$|It was Kenneth who next awakened him. <b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> to {{find the}} lad {{shivering}} as with an ague. His face was ashen.|$|R
60|$|How long {{he slept}} {{he did not}} know. A low noise outside aroused him. <b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> with a start, {{wondering}} what it was.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at}} her. She greeted {{him with a}} mocking, enigmatic smile in which was a poignant gaiety. Over his face went the {{reflection}} of the smile, he smiled, too, purely unconsciously.|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{the bandage}} was applied and {{the flow of blood}} ceased, a few spoonfuls of wine were poured down the patient's throat. It was not long before <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> {{struggled}} into a sitting position.|$|E
60|$|Nor did he {{open his}} eyes again, but lay there marvelling thus until the bandage was {{properly}} tied about his head and sewed together. Then once more <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> looked up to ask where he was.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jack, Jack, wake up." [...] The words broke dully into <b>his</b> slumbers; wearily <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> August Naab {{bent over}} him, shaking him gently.|$|R
60|$|Albert was {{not long}} before <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>He</b> looked round in wonder, and smiled faintly when he saw Edgar, who hastened to his side.|$|R
60|$|She was roused {{from these}} semi-delirious speculations {{in the sun}} furnace by Siegmund's waking. <b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> took a deep breath, and looked smiling at Helena.|$|R
