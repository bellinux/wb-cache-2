40|$|Ligand <b>gated</b> ion <b>channels</b> are {{integral}} multimeric membrane proteins that can detect with high sensitivity {{the presence of}} a specific transmitter in the extracellular space and transduce this signal into an ion flux. While these receptors are widely expressed in the nervous system, their expression is not limited to neurons or their postsynaptic targets but extends to non-neuronal cells where they participate in many physiological responses. Cells have developed complex regulatory mechanisms allowing for the precise control and modulation of ligand <b>gated</b> ion <b>channels.</b> In this overview the roles of accessory subunits and associated proteins in these regulatory mechanisms are reviewed and their relevance illustrated by examples at different ligand <b>gated</b> ion <b>channel</b> types, with emphasis on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.

40|$|A {{systematic}} and integrated approach to automate {{the design of}} <b>gating</b> <b>channels</b> for casting is presented.

Simplified simulation of molten metal impingement, flow, and filling in the mould is carried out, followed by quantitative assessment of the entire gating system using a set of sixteen criteria. This approach enables rapid modification of the gating design and if necessary, the casting design, to achieve the required quality and yield.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} study of the surface acoustic wave mediated quantized transport of electrons through a split gate device containing an impurity potential defined quantum dot within the split <b>gate</b> <b>channel.</b> A new regime of quantized transport is observed at low RF powers where the surface acoustic wave amplitude {{is comparable to the}} quantum dot charging energy. In this regime resonant transport through the single-electron dot state occurs which we interpret as turnstile-like operation in which the traveling wave amplitude modulates the entrance and exit barriers of the quantum dot in a cyclic fashion at GHz frequencies. For high RF powers, where the amplitude of the surface acoustic wave is much larger than the quantum dot energies, the quantized acoustoelectric current transport shows behavior consistent with previously reported results. However, in this regime, the number of quantized current plateaus observed and the plateau widths are determined by the properties of the quantum dot, demonstrating that the microscopic detail of the potential landscape in the split <b>gate</b> <b>channel</b> has a profound influence on the quantized acoustoelectric current transport.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we report on}} a {{technique}} based on infrared emission spectroscopy which {{has been found to}} be useful for non-contact measurement of the temperature of a hot spot in the <b>gate</b> <b>channel</b> of a GaAs metal/semiconductor field effect transistor (MESFET). The technique was demonstrated on a powered and un-powered GaAs MESFET attaining a spatial resolution of 0. 5 microns. A non-destructive submicron-size spot laser beam provided by an HeNe laser excites an extremely small local area of the <b>gate</b> <b>channel</b> of a GaAs MESFET under various operating conditions. Given the state of the experimental test system, we estimate a spatial resolution of about 0. 1 microns and a spectral resolution of about 0. I Angstroms. This provides 15 - 100 times finer spatial resolution than can be obtained using the best passive IR systems available. The temperature resolution (less than 0. 02 K/micron) of this technique is depend upon the spectrometer used, and that it can be improved further. The information obtained from this technique can be used to estimate device lifetimes for critical applications and for measurement of channel temperature of devices under actual operating conditions. Another potential use of the novel technique can be as a cost-effective prescreening tool for determining the "hot spot" channel temperature of devices under normal operating conditions which can further improve device design, yield enhancement, and reliable operatio...|$|E
