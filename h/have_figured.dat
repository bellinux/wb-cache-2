The struggle between the Federalists (who favored a loose confederation of provinces based on rural conservatism) and the Unitarians (pro-liberalism and advocates of a strong central government that would encourage European immigration), set the tone for Argentine literature of the time.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the last}} trial {{was held in}} May 1693, public {{response}} to the events continued. In the decades following the trials, survivors and family members (and their supporters) sought to establish the innocence of the individuals who were convicted and to gain compensation.

In November 2001, years after {{the celebration of the}} 300th anniversary of the trials, the Massachusetts legislature passed an act exonerating all who had been convicted and naming each of the innocent.

25|$|A Child Is Born (full title: A Child Is Born: The {{drama of}} life before birth in {{unprecedented}} photographs. A practical {{guide for the}} expectant mother; original Swedish title: Ett barn blir till) is a 1965 photographic book by Swedish photojournalist Lennart Nilsson. The book consists of photographs charting {{the development of the}} human embryo and fetus from conception to birth; it is reportedly the best-selling illustrated book ever published. Nilsson's photographs are accompanied by text, written by doctors, describing prenatal development and offering advice on antenatal care. The images were among the first of developing fetuses to reach a wide popular audience. Their reproduction in the April 30, 1965, edition of Life magazine sparked so much interest that the entire print run, of eight million copies, sold out within four days; they won Nilsson the American National Press Association Picture of the Year award, and reached a sufficiently iconic status to be chosen for launch into space aboard the NASA probes Voyager 1 and Voyager 2. The book and its images <b>have</b> <b>figured</b> in debates about abortion and the beginning of life, and the book {{is the subject of a}} substantial body of feminist critique.|$|E

Allmusic's Johnny Loftus wrote that [...] "While it expands on melodic elements {{that had previously}} played a supporting role in the band's sound, Blackout also delivers truckloads of crushing guitar and pounding rhythm. And {{whether or not it}} is the presence of a top-line producer, (hed) pe <b>have</b> <b>figured</b> out a way to imbue their aggressive mix of heavy rock and hip-hop with some serious hooks."

500|$|Sir Charles Somerset was {{politically}} successful under both Henry VII and Henry VIII, being made the Earl of Worcester. His son, Henry Somerset, died shortly after inheriting Raglan, {{but not before}} using lead reclaimed from Tintern Abbey to help the building work at Raglan Castle during {{the dissolution of the}} monasteries. His son and grandson, William Somerset and Edward Somerset, proved to be what John Kenyon describes as [...] "wealthy, brilliant and cultured men". William rebuilt much of the Pitched Stone Court, including the hall, adding the Long Gallery and developing the gardens into the new Renaissance style. The Somerset family owned two key castles in the region, Raglan and Chepstow, and these appeared to <b>have</b> <b>figured</b> prominently as important status symbols in paintings owned by the family.|$|E
500|$|The {{repeated}} use of {{the introductory}} phrase [...] "or such as..." [...] implies an initial [...] "such as...", {{and it is likely}} that this first woman treated was Pyrrha, wife of Deucalion. There is some debate about whether the Catalogue included an account of the Flood myth, but the creation of a race of humans born from stones cast by Deucalion and Pyrrha does appear to <b>have</b> <b>figured</b> in the poem. Zeus unsurprisingly had first pick from the catalogue of women, and sired Hellen by Pyrrha. Pyrrha also had three daughters by Deucalion: Thyia, Protogeneia and Pandora, who was named for her maternal grandmother, the famous Pandora. Like their mother, these three lay with Zeus, bearing sons from whom several early Greek tribes were said to descend. Thyia bore Magnes and Macedon; Protogeneia bore Aethlius, the grandfather of Aetolus; and Pandora's son was Graecus.|$|E
500|$|The album {{garnered}} mixed reviews. [...] Billboard {{called the}} album [...] "artfully absurd third-generation rock" [...] {{and the group}} [...] "the first stars of future rock". [...] John Mendelsohn gave the album a favorable review in Rolling Stone, writing that it [...] "represents at least a modest oasis in the desert of dreary blue-jeaned aloofness served up in concert by most American rock-and-rollers." [...] However, referring to [...] "Black Juju" [...] {{he also said that}} [...] "the one bummer on this album is so loud a bummer that it may threaten to neutralize the ingratiating effect" [...] of the other tracks. [...] Robert Christgau rated it B−, stating that he [...] "never would <b>have</b> <b>figured</b> this theatre type to come up with it" [...] and calling [...] "I'm Eighteen" [...] "as archetypal a hard rock single as you're liable to hear in this flaccid year, or maybe ever".|$|E

While King George V and Ajax were scrapped, Centurion was demilitarized by the removal of her armament and was converted into a radio-controlled target ship. In addition to {{being used as a}} target for surface ships, Centurion was used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} various types of aerial bombing. During the Second World War, she was rearmed with light weapons and was converted into a blockship in 1941. In preparation for that operation (subsequently cancelled), she was modified into a decoy with dummy gun turrets in an attempt to fool the Axis powers. Centurion was sent to the Mediterranean in 1942 to escort a convoy to Malta, although the Italians may <b>have</b> <b>figured</b> out the deception. The ship was scuttled off Omaha Beach in June 1944 to form a breakwater to protect a mulberry harbour built to supply the forces ashore.|$|E
500|$|Another major {{breakthrough}} was developing the plot twist that Prince Hans would be revealed as the film's true villain only near the end. Hans {{was not even}} in the earliest drafts, then at first was not a villain, and after becoming one, was revealed to be evil much earlier in the plot. Del Vecho said, [...] "We realized [...] was most important [...] {{if we were going to}} make the ending so surprising you had to believe at one point that Hans was the answer... he's not the answer, it's Kristoff... f you can get the audience to leap ahead and think they <b>have</b> <b>figured</b> it out you can surprise them by turning it the other way." [...] Lee acknowledged that Hans was written as [...] "sociopathic" [...] and [...] "twisted" [...] throughout the final version. For example, Hans mirrors the behavior of the other characters: [...] "He mirrors [...] and he's goofy with her... he Duke [...] is a jerk, so he's a jerk back. And with Elsa he's a hero." [...] It was difficult to lay the foundation for Anna's belated turn to Kristoff without also making Hans' betrayal of Anna too predictable, in that the audience had to [...] "feel... her feeling something but not quite understanding it... Because the minute it is [...] it deflated." [...] At one point, Anna openly flirted with Kristoff upon first meeting him, but that was changed after Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn pointed out that it would confuse and annoy viewers since Anna was already engaged to Hans.|$|E

2500|$|Side Note: This joke is {{a play on}} {{the fact}} that in Russia it is {{believed}} that three is the optimal number of people for drinking.

The classic for the latter was a rectangular pack of soft processed cheese [...] "Druzhba" [...] (Friendship), with that exact price. Therefore, a natural company is 3, each contributing 1 ruble.
