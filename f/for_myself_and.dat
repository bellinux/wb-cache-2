5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes <b>for</b> <b>myself,</b> <b>and,</b> later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E
500|$|Balzac was undeterred by the {{negative}} reactions; referring to Louis Lambert {{and the other}} works in Le Livre mystique, he wrote: [...] "Those are books that I create <b>for</b> <b>myself</b> <b>and</b> for a few others." [...] Although he was often critical of Balzac's work, French author Gustave Flaubert was influenced – perhaps unconsciously – by the book. His own story [...] "La Spirale", written in the 1850s, bears a strong plot resemblance to Balzac's 1832 novel.|$|E

DeGeneres was followed by car to the studio on at least one occasion by a [...] "suspicious man". Some within the entertainment industry assumed that the coming out was simply a ratings stunt, to which DeGeneres responded, [...] "I did it selfishly <b>for</b> <b>myself</b> <b>and</b> because I {{thought it was a great}} thing for the show, which desperately needed a point of view." ...|$|E

500|$|The Nexus7 {{received}} favorable {{reviews from}} critics. Technology commentators {{drew attention to}} its high performance, responsive display and the inclusion of Jelly Bean, {{as well as to}} NFC support. Walter Mossberg of The Wall Street Journal, David Pogue of The New York Times, and TechCrunch columnist MG Siegler acknowledged that Google and Asus had designed a serious competitor to Apple's iPad. Siegler wrote, [...] "ith the Nexus7, Google has, for the first time, created an Android product that I would buy <b>for</b> <b>myself.</b> <b>And</b> I wouldn't have an issue recommending it to anyone else." [...] Consumer-electronics publications Ars Technica, TechRadar, and CNET Australia reviewed the product favorably. Nathan Olivarez-Giles of Wired summed up his view: ...|$|E
500|$|Thin Lizzy, {{along with}} support band The Answer, were to support AC/DC at stadium shows in England, Ireland and Scotland {{at the end}} of June 2009, but these {{appearances}} were cancelled after drummer Aldridge broke his collarbone in an accident. On 30 June, the band's website confirmed that Sykes had left Thin Lizzy and all shows for the rest of 2009 were cancelled or postponed. Gorham stated that he would announce Thin Lizzy's future plans shortly. In a statement, he said, [...] "It's been a very tough time of late <b>for</b> <b>myself</b> <b>and</b> the band, firstly with drummer Tommy Aldridge's injury and now the subsequent decision for John {{and the rest of the}} group to go their separate ways. I can only apologise to everyone who has supported us over the years, but we will be back up to full speed soon." ...|$|E
500|$|While he {{was living}} with Maynard, Salinger {{continued}} to write in a disciplined fashion, a few hours every morning. According to Maynard, by 1972 he had completed two new novels. In a rare 1974 interview with The New York Times, he explained: [...] "There is a marvelous peace in not publishing... I like to write. I love to write. But I write just <b>for</b> <b>myself</b> <b>and</b> my own pleasure." [...] According to Maynard, he saw publication as [...] "a damned interruption". In her memoir, Margaret Salinger describes the detailed filing system her father had for his unpublished manuscripts: [...] "A red mark meant, if I die before I finish my work, publish this 'as is,' blue meant publish but edit first, and so on." [...] A neighbor said that Salinger {{told him that he}} had written 15 unpublished novels.|$|E

500|$|When he was twenty, the National Post {{described}} Raonic as a [...] "hothead whose on-court demeanour {{was holding}} him back." [...] As he grew older, commentators {{came to see}} him as [...] "stoic", [...] "robotic", and [...] "emotionless", with The Daily Telegraph referring to him as [...] "an analytical character who questions everything he does in practice". In 2014, Raonic explained: [...] "I'm the son of two engineers, so everything is a numbers and calculation game." [...] In 2016, he added: [...] "I am very systematic in how [...] need to go about things to bring out the best tennis <b>for</b> <b>myself,</b> <b>and</b> maybe that comes off as mechanical and robotic and those kind of things, but I don't know if I'd ever change that because I feel that's the way I get the best out of myself when it comes to my tennis." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Perry is {{depicted}} as having suicidal thoughts and {{lying on the floor}} of a bathroom. The song opens with only piano and Perry's vocals, while she sings [...] "Was twenty-seven, surviving my return from Saturn", and as the song carries on, she finds her strength, singing [...] "By the grace of God / I picked myself back up / I put one foot in front of the other and I / Looked in the mirror and decided to stay / Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way". Perry commented on the lyrics: [...] " [...] are very exact and autobiographical. That's how I write. But the one thing about those lyrics is you can hear me finding my strength throughout the song. It starts off really low and then I kind of stand up <b>for</b> <b>myself</b> <b>and</b> say, 'No!'." [...] The song also sees Perry rejecting the idea that the relationship ended because of her.|$|E

However, {{it would have to be}} pushed back to 2013. Pusha T described the tape as street-oriented music intended for his longtime fans. [...] "Wrath of Caine is basically just me catering to my core. It's all about just street Hip Hop, street music" [...] he said. [...] "It's just something that I like to do. It's something that I feel like has no boundaries, no parameters. I can do what I really, really want to do… not about more of a creative , I just think it's about more of what I want to hear <b>for</b> <b>myself</b> <b>and</b> what my fans want to hear. They want to hear lyrics, they want to hear street …it's just the whole street life perspective." ...|$|E

500|$|An {{inspired}} {{performance by}} Bergkamp helped Arsenal win 0–4 at West Ham United {{in the first}} weekend of February. He, however missed the following match, away to Manchester United, due to suspension along with Petit; Keown was absent due to a hamstring injury. Arsenal conceded a first half penalty when Ray Parlour brought down Ronny Johnsen. Dwight Yorke missed, chipping the ball wide of the right-hand post, and was made to pay {{early in the second}} half as new signing Nwankwo Kanu's through ball found striker Anelka, who scored. Andy Cole equalised moments after – Arsenal's first goal conceded in two months, and with both teams spurring chances to win the match, it ended in a 1–1 draw. Three days after, Anelka scored his first career hat-trick against Leicester City. Bergkamp after the match felt Arsenal were now equipped to push on for a title challenge, like last season: [...] "It's all coming back. I feel it, <b>for</b> <b>myself</b> <b>and</b> for the team." [...] A draw at Newcastle left the team three points behind Chelsea, in third position.|$|E
500|$|Metallica's Lars Ulrich, who, {{along with}} bandmate James Hetfield {{inducted}} Black Sabbath into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006, said [...] "Black Sabbath is {{and always will}} be synonymous with heavy metal", while Hetfield said [...] "Sabbath got me started on all that evil-sounding shit, and it's stuck with me. Tony Iommi is the king of the heavy riff." [...] former Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash said of the Paranoid album: [...] "There's just something about that whole record that, when you're a kid and you're turned onto it, it's like a whole different world. It just opens up your mind to another dimension...Paranoid is the whole Sabbath experience; very indicative of what Sabbath meant at the time. Tony's playing style—doesn't matter whether it's off Paranoid or if it's off Heaven and Hell—it's very distinctive." [...] Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian said [...] "I always get the question in every interview I do, 'What are your top five metal albums?' I make it easy <b>for</b> <b>myself</b> <b>and</b> always say the first five Sabbath albums." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 26, 2010, Levy's then-64-year-old father, Robert, {{took the}} stand and refuted {{statements}} about his past suspicions of Condit. Robert Levy testified that he told authorities {{during the early years}} of the investigation that his daughter Chandra would have been too cautious to jog in the woods alone, but said that he no longer believed this to be true. He said that he also told police that his daughter and Condit had a five-year plan between them to get married. In retrospect, Robert Levy admitted: [...] "I just said whatever came to mind just to point to him as the villain." [...] Levy added that he had been convinced that Condit was [...] "guilty until we learned about this character here," [...] referring to Guandique. On November 1, Condit testified at the trial and was asked on at least three occasions if he and Chandra Levy had been involved in a sexual relationship. He replied, [...] "I am not going to respond to that question out of privacy <b>for</b> <b>myself</b> <b>and</b> Chandra." [...] FBI biologist Alan Giusti testified that semen found on underwear from Levy's apartment contained sperm matching Condit's DNA profile.|$|E

500|$|The Red Cross {{was criticized}} for claims of skimping on aid given to some people and even racial discrimination. Some large {{families}} reportedly received as little as $2. In Delray Beach, a woman who completely lost her home, said she was given only [...] "a few old pieces of clothes and a few cans of tomatoes and potted meat and a small can of milk <b>for</b> <b>myself</b> <b>and</b> kids." [...] Grace Campbell, a chair of a workers committee, was quoted in The Chicago Defender stating that only 20% of relief was being dispersed to African Americans. A rumor circulated, which even garnered sympathy from Governor Martin, that a black man named Levi Brown was eating ham in a mess tent and was struck {{in the head and}} shoulder with an ax by a Red Cross worker, told him [...] "ham was not for niggers." [...] Brown himself admitted that he was actually assaulted with a meat cleaver in a restaurant. The claims of partiality were refuted by the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, and Mary McLeod Bethune in a telegraph to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).|$|E
500|$|The {{accepted}} cover, {{designed by}} Aimee Macauley, features {{a photo of}} Nas as a child superimposed over a backdrop of a New York city block, taken by Danny Clinch. In a 1994 interview, Nas discussed the concept behind the photo of him at age 7, stating [...] "That was the year I started to acknowledge everything [...] That's the year everything set off. That's the year I started seeing the future <b>for</b> <b>myself</b> <b>and</b> doing what was right. The ghetto makes you think. The world is ours. I used to think I couldn't leave my projects. I used to think if I left, if anything happened to me, I {{thought it would be}} no justice or I would be just a dead slave or something. The projects used to be my world until I educated myself to see there's more out there." [...] As yet, Nas has not pointed to any outside influence for the artwork of his album cover. Yet according to Ego Trip, the cover of Illmatic is [...] "reputedly" [...] believed to have been inspired by a jazz album, Howard Hanger Trio's A Child Is Born (1974) [...] whose cover also features a photograph of a child, superimposed on an urban landscape.|$|E
500|$|... 2003 {{marked a}} {{significant}} {{turning point in}} Sarsgaard's career, when he starred in the feature film Shattered Glass. He depicted journalist Charles Lane, the lead editor of The New Republic. Shattered Glass {{is based on the}} real events of journalist Stephen Glass' career at The New Republic during the mid-1990s and his fall when his widespread journalistic fraud is exposed. During promotion of the film, Sarsgaard noted of his portrayal of Lane: [...] "I just wanted to get his perspective on the actual events. [...] I think that I tried to have some respect <b>for</b> <b>myself</b> <b>and</b> that way you're respecting the real person you're playing. I've done it a number of times. And it's always a little bit confusing. The {{best thing to do is}} just to ignore the fact, I think, that you're playing somebody who is a real life character." [...] According to the San Diego Union-Tribune, [...] "Peter Sarsgaard is appealingly level, a stolid straight-shooter as Lane". A reviewer from the Chicago Tribune noted that Sarsgaard plays Lane with [...] "great subtlety and grace". The newspaper concluded with, [...] "The character doesn't seethe with personal resentment; when he does a slow burn, he conveys a much deeper sense of a man's value system being violated past the breaking point." [...] Sarsgaard's performance in the film earned him his first Golden Globe Award nomination and an Independent Spirit Award nomination.|$|E
