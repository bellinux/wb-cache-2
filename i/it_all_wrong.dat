500|$|Syro is an {{electronic}} music album. All 12songs {{on the album}} were written by James in-studio. According to James, the songs were written over an extended period; Syro features both archived and more recent compositions, with the album's oldest track around [...] "six or seven years old". The album was recorded in six different studios, including James' own studio in Scotland, which he spent three years building and which was completed in 2006. One audio engineer spent three months with James, helping him wire together patch panels and [...] "then [...] realized he was doing <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>wrong</b> and had to start again". Describing the overall process as [...] "brutal", James referred to the in-studio technical issues as the catalyst for writing new music that would be featured on Syro.|$|E
500|$|On March 13, 2006, Hayes {{announced}} that he was quitting the show because of the series' treatment of religion, saying, [...] "There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins. Religious beliefs are sacred to people, and at all times should be respected and honored. As a civil rights activist of the past 40 years, I cannot support a show that disrespects those beliefs and practices." [...] The Guardian observed that Hayes did not specifically mention Scientology in his statement. Later in an interview on CNN's Showbiz Tonight, Hayes added he did not see the episode itself, but was told about it. In a separate interview, he reportedly said regarding Parker and Stone, [...] "Guys, you have <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>wrong.</b> We're not like that. I know that's your thing, but get your information correct, because somebody might believe that shit, you know? But I understand what they're doing. I told them to take a couple of Scientology courses, and understand what we do." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{dismissal}} of Daryll Cullinan in 1999 {{was the second}} instance in ODIs: facing the West Indian spinner Keith Arthurton, Cullinan fended the ball off into the ground. It bounced high in the air, and Cullinan removed his right hand from his bat to catch it as it fell again. Despite {{the fact that it}} was unlikely that the ball would land near the stumps, the West Indies captain, Brian Lara, appealed, and Cullinan was dismissed. The next occurrence was two years later, in a Test match between Australia and India. In the first innings of the match, Steve Waugh was struck on the pads by a delivery from Harbhajan Singh. The umpire turned down the appeal, but as he did so, the ball bounced and spun towards the stumps. Waugh was alerted by a shout from the non-striking batsman, and instinctively swept the ball away with his free hand. The most recent instance came during the same year as Waugh's dismissal, in another Test match involving India. England's Michael Vaughan missed an attempted sweep against Sarandeep Singh, and the ball trickled along the ground after striking his pads. Vaughan brushed the ball away with his hand, despite {{the fact that it was}} not travelling towards the stumps. Initially, he claimed that he was attempting the give the ball back to the fielder at short leg, but he later admitted that he [...] "should have just held up [...] hands and said 'I got <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>wrong,</b> I'm an idiot.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} for The A.V. Club on January 4, 2006, Hayes was again asked about the episode.

I know thatâ€™s your thing, but get your information correct, because somebody might believe that shit, you know?" [...] He then told them {{to take a couple}} of Scientology courses to understand what they do. [...] In the interview, Hayes defended South Park's style of controversial humor, noting that he was not pleased with the show's treatment of Scientology, but conceding that he [...] "understands what Matt and Trey are doing." ...|$|E
