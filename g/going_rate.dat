It was the height of the Great Depression and the <b>going</b> <b>rate</b> for the players was 3 pounds per match, but Richmond only paid half that for unused reserves, so Hughes saved the club thirty shillings on the day. Dyer got another couple of chances and showed some form, but by mid-season found himself in the seconds team, with players who were not quite league standard, but wanted to stay on at the club and earn an extra few shillings per week to support their families.|$|E

In the summer of 1962, Saskatchewan became the centre of a hard-fought struggle between the provincial government, the North American medical establishment, and the province's physicians, who brought things to a halt with the 1962 Saskatchewan doctors' strike. The doctors believed their best interests were not being met and feared a significant loss of income as well as government interference in medical care decisions even though Douglas agreed that his government would pay the <b>going</b> <b>rate</b> for service that doctors charged.

The Athletics made the playoffs for four straight years, from 2000 to 2003, but lost their first round (best three-out-of-five) series in each case, 3 games to 2. In two of those years (2001 against the Yankees and 2003 against the Red Sox), the Athletics won the first two games of the series, only to lose the next three straight.

The House of Representatives instead considered legislation to reduce the valuation of the Spanish coins to ten cents per real, and to strike a twenty-cent piece, of [...]900 silver, to facilitate the exchange. [...] Neil Carothers, in his book on small-denomination American money, suggests that the House's plan would have resulted in the Spanish coins staying in circulation, and any twenty-cent pieces issued being hoarded or melted. No legislation passed in 1850, which saw continued export of America's silver coinage.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 47 - 59) There {{has been}} {{a significant increase in the}} Latina college <b>going</b> <b>rates</b> throughout the last couple of years, yet research has shown that Latinas have found themselves entering community colleges at larger rates than any other area of higher education. When Latinas are compared to their white counterparts pursuing a higher education at a 4 year institution Latinas are significantly underrepresented. The literature on Latina college aspirations are strongly connected and affected by family support and knowledge. As the Latino population continue to grow, it becomes vital to indentify the factors that can aid the increase of Latina college <b>going</b> <b>rates,</b> specifically to 4 year institutions. Considering the impact that family has on Latina aspirations and higher education attainment, the lack of knowledge that Latino parents hold about the U. S. educational system, process and the absence of spaces that would allow parents to share their feelings all need to be addressed. The purpose of this graduate project is to develop a set of workshops leading to a stemming support group intended for Latino parents of 11 th and 12 th grade Latina students. The workshops will present factual information about the higher education structure and process, but will mainly concentrate on initiating a discussion with the parents about issues not typically addressed by the school. Topics such as culture and acculturation will lead the discussions surrounded around multiple activities. The goal is to equip parents with the knowledge and skills necessary to begin a conversation with their daughters by addressing the critical issues in a safe space as well as providing continual support...|$|R
