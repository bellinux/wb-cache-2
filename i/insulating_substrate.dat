However, existing methods generally follow a "synthesis + patterning" strategy, which are time consuming and costly for fabricating high-quality graphene patterns on desired substrates. We developed a nanofabrication process to deposit high-quality graphene patterns directly on <b>insulating</b> <b>substrates</b> via a solid-phase laser direct writing (LDW) process. Open-air and room-temperature fabrication of graphene patterns on <b>insulating</b> <b>substrates</b> {{has been achieved}} via a femtosecond LDW process without graphene transfer and patterning. Various graphene patterns, including texts, spirals, line arrays, and integrated circuit patterns, with a feature line width of 800 nm and a low sheet resistance of 205 ohm/sq, were fabricated. The LDW method provides a facile and cost-effective way to fabricate complex and high-quality graphene patterns directly on target substrates, which opens a door for fabricating various advanced functional devices...|$|R

To achieve this, a growth method of high quality GeSn films on <b>insulating</b> <b>substrates</b> by combination of laser irradiation and subsequent thermal annealing is developed. Here, the laser fluence is chosen as weak, which is below the critical fluence for crystallization of GeSn. It is clarified that for samples irradiated with weak laser fluence, complete crystallization of GeSn films is achieved by subsequent thermal annealing at ∼ 170 oC without incubation time. In addition, the quality of GeSn films obtained by this method is higher compared with conventional growth techniques such as melting growth by pulsed laser annealing or solid-phase crystallization (SPC) without pre-laser irradiation. Substitutional Sn concentrations in the grown layers estimated by Raman spectroscopy measurements are 8 - 10 %, which far exceed thermal equilibrium solid-solubility of Sn in Ge (∼ 2 %). These phenomena are explained by generation of {{a limited number of}} nuclei by weak laser irradiation and lateral SPC by subsequent thermal annealing.

50|$|Electrostatic spray {{ionization}} (ESTASI) is an ambient {{ionization method}} for mass spectrometry (MS) {{analysis of samples}} located on a flat or porous surface, or inside a microchannel. It was developed in 2011 by Professor Hubert H. Girault’s group at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland. In a typical ESTASI process, a droplet of a protic solvent containing analytes is deposited on a sample area of interest which itself is mounted to an <b>insulating</b> <b>substrate.</b> Under this substrate and right below the droplet, an electrode is placed and connected with a pulsed high voltage (HV) to electrostatically charge the droplet during pulsing.

One advantage of ESTASI is, that the electrode and sample droplet act contact-less avoiding thereby any oxidation or reduction of the sample compounds at the electrode surface, which often happens during standard electrospray ionization (ESI). ESTASI is a powerful new ambient ionization technique that has already found many applications in the detection of different analytes, such as organic molecules, peptides and proteins with molecule weight up to 70 kDa.
