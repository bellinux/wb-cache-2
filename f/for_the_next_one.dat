25|$|In the tetrameric form {{of normal}} adult hemoglobin, the binding of oxygen is, thus, a {{cooperative}} process. The binding affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen is increased by the oxygen saturation of the molecule, {{with the first}} molecules of oxygen bound influencing the shape of <b>the</b> binding sites <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>ones,</b> in a way favorable for binding. This positive cooperative binding is achieved through steric conformational changes of the hemoglobin protein complex as discussed above; i.e., when one subunit protein in hemoglobin becomes oxygenated, a conformational or structural change in the whole complex is initiated, causing the other subunits to gain an increased affinity for oxygen. As a consequence, the oxygen binding curve of hemoglobin is sigmoidal, or S-shaped, {{as opposed to the}} normal hyperbolic curve associated with noncooperative binding.|$|R
