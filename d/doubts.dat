25|$|We {{should note}} that Descartes' <b>doubt</b> is a methodological and {{rational}} <b>doubt.</b> That is, the Meditator is not just <b>doubting</b> everything at random, but is providing solid reasons for his <b>doubt</b> at each stage. For instance, he rejects {{the possibility that he}} might be mad, since that would undercut the rationality that motivates his <b>doubt.</b> Descartes is trying to set up this <b>doubt</b> within a rational framework, and needs to maintain a claim to rationality for his arguments to proceed.|$|R
5000|$|While methodic <b>doubt</b> has a nature, {{one need}} not hold that {{knowledge}} is impossible in order to apply the method of <b>doubt.</b> Indeed, Descartes' attempt to apply the method of <b>doubt</b> {{to the existence of}} himself spawned the proof of his famous saying, [...] "Cogito ergo sum" [...] (I think, therefore I am). That is, Descartes tried to <b>doubt</b> his own existence, but found that even his <b>doubting</b> showed that he existed, since he could not <b>doubt</b> if he did not exist.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} higher-order <b>doubt</b> generates an epistemic dilemma. One has a higher-order <b>doubt</b> {{with regards to}} P insofar as one justifiably withholds belief as to what {{attitude}} towards P is justified. That is, one justifiably withholds belief as to whether one is justified in believing, disbelieving, or withholding belief in P. Using the resources provided by Richard Feldman’s recent discussion of how to respect one’s evidence, I argue that if one has a higher-order <b>doubt</b> with regards to P, then one is not justified in having any attitude towards P. Otherwise put: No attitude towards the <b>doubted</b> proposition respects one’s higher-order <b>doubt.</b> I argue that the most promising response to this problem is to hold that when one has a higher-order <b>doubt</b> about P, the best one can do to respect such a <b>doubt</b> is to simply have no attitude towards P. Higher-order <b>doubt</b> is thus much more rationally corrosive than non-higher-order <b>doubt,</b> as it undermines the possibility of justifiably having any attitude towards the <b>doubted</b> proposition...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this note}} is to {{formulate}} questions that make evident certain difficulties involved in understanding the methodical Cartesian <b>doubt.</b> It is a critical evaluation that starts from the following hypothesis: either the methodical <b>doubt</b> is unintelligible or {{it is not a}} <b>doubt.</b> Prima facie, the methodical <b>doubt</b> seems to be irrational, for in its scope we find propositions that seem to be paradigms of rationality. Some explanations of the intelligibility of the methodical <b>doubt</b> seem to take away its <b>doubting</b> character, like those that seek to make the methodical <b>doubt</b> and the belief compatible. The main questions dealt with in this note are: (1) What is the epistemic motivation for the methodical <b>doubt?</b> (2) Given what is available to the meditator in the First Meditation, can what is presented as a reason for <b>doubting</b> really be so regarded? (3) Is the methodical <b>doubt</b> compatible with the epistemic demands of practical life? (4) What {{is the nature of the}} attitude called “doubt” and what is its object...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Harry Frankfurt {{has argued}} that Descartes’s madness <b>doubt</b> in the First Meditation is {{importantly}} different from his dreaming <b>doubt.</b> The madness <b>doubt</b> {{does not provide a}} reason for <b>doubting</b> the senses, since were the meditator to suppose he is mad, his ability to successfully complete the philosophical investigation he sets for himself in the first few pages of the Meditations would be undermined. I argue that Frankfurt’s (1970) interpretation of Descartes’s madness <b>doubt</b> is mistaken and that it should be understood as playing the same role as his more famous dreaming <b>doubt.</b> I focus my discussion around four questions: (Q 1) What does the meditator have in mind when speaking of madness?; (Q 2) Why does the meditator so quickly dismiss the madness <b>doubt</b> but take seriously the dreaming doubt?; (Q 3) Does the madness <b>doubt</b> have the same scope as the dreaming doubt?; and (Q 4) Why does the meditator bring up the madness <b>doubt</b> at all...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I {{present and}} defend a novel account of <b>doubt.</b> In Part 1, I make some {{preliminary}} observations {{about the nature}} of <b>doubt.</b> In Part 2, I introduce a new puzzle about the relationship between three psychological states: <b>doubt,</b> belief, and confidence. I present this puzzle because my account of <b>doubt</b> emerges as a possible solution to it. Lastly, in Part 3, I elaborate on and defend my account of <b>doubt.</b> Roughly, one has <b>doubt</b> if and only if one believes one might be wrong; I argue that this is superior to the account that says that one has <b>doubt</b> if and only if one has less than the highest degree of confidence...|$|R
