500|$|A {{thermal imaging}} camera (colloquially {{known as a}} TIC) {{is a type of}} thermographic camera used in firefighting. [...] By {{rendering}} infrared radiation as visible light, such cameras allow firefighters to see areas of heat through smoke, darkness, or heat-permeable barriers. Thermal imaging cameras are typically handheld, but may be helmet-mounted. [...] They are constructed using heat- and water-resistant housings, and ruggedized to withstand the hazards of <b>fireground</b> operations.|$|E

50|$|The Dutchess County (DC) Fire and EMS {{radio system}} has 16 channels, {{comprising}} 9 UHF frequencies, that uses continuous tone coded squelch system (CTCSS) to eliminate outside interference, and Radio repeater base stations to enhance {{and extend the}} mobile communications. The 16 channels are divided into five main categories; Dispatch, Response, Command, <b>Firegrounds</b> & Field Operations. Individual agencies and departments can request their own frequency utilizing the UHF band.|$|R
50|$|Commissioner Rizzo {{remained}} on the <b>firegrounds</b> throughout the warm, muggy August day to continue to oversee the firefighting operation. Philadelphia’s two foam pumpers, Engines 160 and 133, along with the Gulf Refinery’s foam pumper, continued to apply foam to the burning tank, piping and manifolds. Additional foam was acquired throughout the day from the fire department’s warehouse and the nearby Atlantic Richfield refinery. It was also obtained from the National Foam Company in West Chester, Pennsylvania.|$|R
500|$|The United Kingdom, has a {{standardised}} {{range of}} metric hose diameters: 7, 9, 12.5 and 15 cm (2.8, 3.5, 4.9 and 5.9 in), {{with the two}} smallest diameters sometimes used twined to provide adequate flow rates. Within this range, the [...] hoses are fitted with [...] "Instantaneous Couplings"; the [...] hoses have Storz couplings; and the [...] hose comes in two types, one with [...] "Instantaneous Couplings" [...] and one with Storz fittings. Fire Service Manuals provide tables of maximum volumetric flow rates for a given pump pressure, hose diameter and total hose length. The use of these tables, is to facilitate the selection of suitable hoses, {{taking into account the}} frictional losses caused by transporting water through the strainer, hoses, pump and fire fighting nozzles, to draft water from source to the <b>fireground.</b>|$|E
2500|$|FireLink is the {{new digital}} FRS wide area {{communications}} system in England, Scotland and Wales. The FRS use wide area radios to communicate between vehicles and control rooms but {{there has never been}} a fully compatible system. [...] FireLink is more efficient and provides greater resilience for command and control. The fire service's ability to communicate efficiently, across different brigades and with other emergency services has never been easy. The issue was raised by Sir Desmond Fennell, who conducted the public inquiry into the King's Cross fire in 1987. [...] Fennell recommended when his report was published in 1988 that <b>fireground</b> communications be addressed as an issue of [...] "high importance".|$|E
5000|$|Officer ranks {{above the}} company officer level are {{frequently}} {{referred to as}} [...] "Chief Officer" [...] ranks.

50|$|For {{a period}} of time, {{it was far from}} certain where the fire would be stopped. Burk was quoted as saying that {{contingency}} plans had been made for a retreat through the refinery, street by street, tank by tank. But far from retreating, the men of the Philadelphia Fire Department attacked, retaking 5th Street, 4th Street, and finally Avenue Y. At 1:00 a.m., Commissioner Rizzo left the <b>firegrounds,</b> relinquishing command to Deputy Fire Commissioner Harry T. Kite, who placed the fire under control at 5:38 a.m. on Monday, August 18, 1975.|$|R

50|$|It was now 4:41 p.m. and a {{firestorm}} was developing {{as the fire}} quickly spread eastward along Avenue “Y” towards 5th Street. Viewing the unfolding horror before him, Commissioner Rizzo ordered two more alarms, five additional rescue squads, and the recall of all companies which had previously been released from the <b>firegrounds</b> throughout the day. The burned firefighters were loaded into the Gulf Refinery Ambulance which roared past Rescue 7 a mobile intensive care squad the first apparatus to arrive on the scene after the liquid reignited On the Commissioners orders, the fire alarm room transmitted the seventh and eighth alarms. As the fire had been placed under control nearly eight hours earlier, firefighters in stations across the city knew that the unthinkable had occurred as these additional alarms were struck. At 4:46 p.m., Commissioner Rizzo ordered the ninth alarm and notification of Philadelphia Managing Director Hillel Levinson as a major disaster was now unfolding at the Gulf Refinery.|$|R

40|$|Accurately {{measured}} momentum transfer {{collision frequency}} and electron density for fire plasma enable correct simulation of electromagnetic wave propagation in the medium. The simulation {{is essential for}} designing high-performance systems suitable for the environment. Despite this, momentum transfer collision frequency for fire plumes {{has always been an}} estimated quantity and/or crudely determined. There are anecdotal reports of severe line-of-sight (LOS) radio frequency signal degradation on <b>firegrounds.</b> The problem has implications on safety of fire-fighters during wildfire suppression hence the need of high performance communication systems. In the experiment, a nonintrusive and direct method for measuring momentum transfer collision frequency in a fire plume was carried out. Using an automatic network analyser, x-band microwaves were caused to propagate combustion zones of eucalyptus and grass litter fires to measure the flames, scattering parameters. The parameters were then used to determine average collision frequencies for the plumes. The average collision frequencies for the eucalyptus and grass fire plumes were measured to be 5. 84 × 1010 and 5. 92 × 1010 [*]rad/s, respectively...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} ways that firefighters 2 ̆ 7 utilize {{multimodal}} literacy practices to construct and communicate knowledge in environments where risk is present. Specifically, this dissertation sketches the interrelationships between alphabetic, aural, cognitive, gestural, kinesthetic, oral, tactile, spatial, and visual genres which evolve and circulate within embodied, analog, and digital media on <b>firegrounds.</b> A heuristic research methodology was constructed by borrowing and adapting components from extant multimodal and digital ethnography, community-based research, and writing activity and genre research. Using a range of emergent digital research methods, data was captured during six observational periods wherein 75 participants engaged in live-fire training activities; supplemental data was collected 16 participants who volunteered to discuss their practices during open-interviews. Data was analyzed using a framework that triangulated multimodal theory, writing, activity, and genre research, and rhetorical theory and included tools such as genre ecology mapping and rhetorical analysis. Analysis suggested that (1) firefighters leverage {{a wide array of}} literacy practices drawing from a full range of semiotic resources to construct communicative and mediational genres; (2) firefighters of different rank have access distinct genres and genre assemblages; (3) firefighters uses of multimodal genres were agentive, interpenetrated, pathos laden, and richly layered. ...|$|R
40|$|Major {{earthquakes}} {{are rare}} events {{in most countries}} {{but there have been}} cases in urban regions of fire following earthquakes. Its potential for growth and spread was again evident in the recent Northridge and Kobe earthquakes. This report identifies ways in which fire protection and fire engineering can work through public sector and private sector actions to reduce post-earthquake fire losses in urban building stock. It suggests a set of practical measures for building fire loss reduction that could be taken by territorial authorities, Fire Service, building owners and tenants, property and risk managers, insurers and fire engineers. It presents analyses of literature from international sources concerning fourteen recent earthquake events having fire impacts on major population centres. They identify the exceptional conditions present in the post-earthquake environment after major shaking, and how the mechanisms of fire ignition and the dynamics of fire spread usually present in the non-earthquake situation are modified {{in the aftermath of a}}n earthquake to escalate fire losses, and cause the impairment of the normal processes for the control and suppression of fire. The management of the impact of fire in buildings can be achieved through structural fire design, to control the movement of fire and to provide structural stability. However, the structural and non-structural damage caused to buildings by earthquakes can lead to the loss of integrity of passive protection systems and allow the uncontrolled migration of smoke and hot gases internally. If automatic or manual suppression is delayed, the fire resistance of structural members is likely to be challenged. Fire protection and earthquake protection need to interact if fire safety systems are to continue to function after an earthquake. Effective seismic capacity in the design of sprinkler system components, pipework and on-site water storage are essential for reliable performance in the aftermath of a major earthquake, as the response of fire brigades to requests for emergency assistance, and their suppression effectiveness at <b>firegrounds</b> are likely to be impaired. This report provides a comprehensive list of measures for building fire loss reduction in the aftermath of an earthquake, and recommends areas for future research...|$|R
