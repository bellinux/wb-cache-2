40|$|Various schemes use radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) for apparel data protection, along with encryption algorithms for RFID tags. In the cryptography approach, particular vendor type of <b>reader's</b> public <b>key</b> and its unique private key should be carried by each tag, and during reading, {{with the help of}} embedded <b>keys,</b> <b>readers</b> and tags may mutually authenticate each other. The Hash Function approach is simple and straight forward to achieve data protection, where the electronic product code (EPC) in the tag is being protected, and only an authorized reader is able to unlock the tag, then lock the tag after reading the code. The Randomized Hash Lock is an extension of the Hash Lock based on pseudo-random functions (PRF), where an additional pseudo-random number is required to embed into tags for this approach. It is noted that if one can afford high-cost tags, then many capabilities can be incorporated inside tags, namely, computation, encryption and the like. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

Explanations of the main strands to feminism, such as liberalism, sit alongside an exploration {{of a range of}} approaches, such as radical, anarchist and Marxist feminism, and provide much-needed context against which more familiar historical themes may be understood.

40|$|The {{dramatic}} {{setting of}} Plato’s Symposium obscures its {{function as a}} discourse that establishes the political philosophy of its author. The effort to identify the political within an ostensibly apolitical dialogue reflects the ancient attempt to use the casual and leisurely {{as a tool for}} prying open the more serious. I want to suggest that readings of the Symposium which do not attempt to uncover fully the political achieve only a partial understanding of Plato’s program within the work. I also want to establish the possibility that Plato relies on a historical and literary intertext with writers such as Thucydides and Aristophanes in order to <b>key</b> the <b>reader</b> into the underlying, and potentially dangerous, political nature of the dialogue. When such historical intertext goes unnoticed or is dismissed, the reader constructs, I submit, an insurmountable obstacle for the understanding of the work. On the other hand, only when the reader recognizes Plato’s use of historical material, can the Symposium be viewed properly as a forum for the development of political philosophy {{in the guise of a}} literary drama...|$|R
