25|$|<b>Koreans</b> <b>are</b> {{the second}} largest group of foreign {{nationals}} living in Japan, before the Chinese, Filipinos, and after the Brazilians and Peruvians. Ethnicity censuses are not available in Japan, what leaves naturalized citizens {{that are part of}} these and other immigrant populations, as well historical groups with their own identity such as the Ryukyuans, the Ainu and the mixed-race Japanese invisible, so figures giving Yamato people an amount of about 98.5% of the Japanese population are very likely exaggerated.|$|E
25|$|Most <b>Koreans</b> <b>are</b> {{business}} owners with establishments such as restaurants, video rental places, bars and saunas, {{many of which}} cater exclusively to the Korean population, with signs and menus in Korean. There have been conflicts between Korean-owned businesses and Mexican neighbors over noise and sanitation issues, with some Mexicans complaining that the Koreans {{do not want to}} adapt to Mexican society. Another issue has been legal problems, both with the status of merchandise and the status of employees. A store owned by Koreans was shut down by police for selling imported merchandise of questionable origin in 2002, with 33 workers detained.|$|E
25|$|After the 2015 census, it was {{revealed}} that foreign-origin family names were becoming more common in South Korea, due to naturalised citizens transcribing their surnames in hangul. Between 2000 and 2015, more than 4,800 new surnames were registered. During the census, a total of 5,582 distinct surnames were collected, 73% of which do not have corresponding hanja characters. It was also revealed that despite the surge in the number of surnames, the ratio of top 10 surnames had not changed. 44.6% of South <b>Koreans</b> <b>are</b> still named Kim, Lee or Park, {{while the rest of the}} top 10 are made up of Choi, Jeong, Kang, Jo, Yoon, Jang and Lim.|$|E
50|$|Old <b>Korean</b> <b>is</b> attested in Chinese histories, in the Three Kingdoms {{period of}} Korea (ca. 0 to 900 CE), when the Silla Kingdom (in Eastern Korea), Baekje Kingdom (in Southwestern Korea), and Goguryeo Kingdom (in Northern Korea) were {{simultaneously}} {{present on the}} Korean peninsula, although <b>Korean</b> <b>was</b> not a literary language until later; the hangul script of <b>Korean</b> <b>was</b> invented in the 15th century CE (the earlier Idu script dates to the 6th century CE).|$|R
50|$|Modern <b>Korean</b> <b>is</b> {{written with}} spaces between words, a feature {{not found in}} Chinese or Japanese. <b>Korean</b> {{punctuation}} marks <b>are</b> almost identical to Western ones.

50|$|It {{is unclear}} whether Old <b>Korean</b> may have <b>been</b> a tonal language. It is assumed that Old <b>Korean</b> <b>was</b> divided into dialects, {{corresponding}} to the three kingdoms. These hypothetical subdivisions of Old <b>Korean</b> <b>are</b> also known as Buyeo languages. Of these, the Sillan language is the best attested due to the political domination of Later Silla by the seventh century.|$|R
25|$|Zainichi (resident in Japan) <b>Koreans</b> <b>are</b> {{permanent}} residents of Japan registered as Joseon (Korean: 조선, Japanese: Chōsen, 朝鮮) or South Korean nationality. Joseon {{was the last}} Korean kingdom that perished due to the Japanese colonization, therefore Zainichi Koreans with Joseon citizenship are de facto stateless. After World War II, 2 million Koreans living in Japan were granted a temporary Joseon nationality under the US military government (because there was no government in Korea then). However, the meaning of Joseon nationality became vague as Korea was divided by the United States and the Soviet Union, and in 1948 North and South Korea established their own governments, respectively. Some obtained South Korean citizenship later, but others who opposed the division of Korea or sympathized with North Korea maintained their Joseon nationality because people {{are not allowed to}} register North Korean nationality.|$|E

2500|$|Beer is not {{the most}} popular {{alcoholic}} beverage among North Koreans, who generally prefer the Korean liquor soju. As consequence, North Korean beer is still little known. Nevertheless, beer and soju are the two most common alcoholic drinks in the country, with 94.9 percent of all alcohol consumed (in pure alcohol) being liquor and the remaining 5.1 percent beer. An average North Korean consumes just under a liter of pure alcohol in the form of beer annually.

It is the same with us Manchus (Jušen) and Mongols. Our languages are different, but our clothing and way of life is the same." [...] Later Nurhaci indicated that the bond with the Mongols was not based in any real shared culture. It was for pragmatic reasons of [...] "mutual opportunism", since Nurhaci said to the Mongols: [...] "You Mongols raise livestock, eat meat and wear pelts.

2500|$|... 70% of Koreans in New Zealand {{identify}} as Christians, while roughly another 20% claim to follow no religion. Buddhists number only about 5%. One Christian newspaper estimates that roughly 35-40% of all <b>Koreans</b> <b>are</b> [...] "active Christians" [...] who regularly attend worship services, mostly {{at one of}} New Zealand's 100 Korean churches. Korean Christians in New Zealand are largely of the Presbyterian denomination, though some are also Baptist. They attend non-Korean churches less often due to language barriers and cultural differences within the church. In Korean churches, the pastor has much more authority, and many churches open as early as 5AM for morning prayers. New Zealand's Korean Christians are served by a weekly Christian newspaper published in the Korean language, which claims to have a circulation of 3,500; it discusses religious issues as well as issues of common interest to immigrants, such as migration law and property ownership.|$|E

2500|$|Shin Chaeho {{has also}} {{argued for the}} {{existence}} of monotheism in ancient Korea, elevating Koreans to the [...] "advanced" [...] civilizations of the Middle East; however, this theory contradicts other nationalist historiography which propose Shamanism as an ancient Korean religion, {{as well as that of}} nearly all religious historians, who say Koreans were syncretist. Na Se-jin, Korea's most quoted physical anthropologist, asserted in 1964 that <b>Koreans</b> <b>are</b> superior in [...] "looks, brains, bravery, stature, and strength" [...] to the Chinese and Japanese, and resemble Europeans more than [...] "Mongoloids", reflecting nationalist historiography's fixation on prehistorical racial roots. For Shin, the founding of Korea by such an antique figure as Dangun proved that Korea was more ancient that China; that Dangun colonized China proving that Korea was superior to China; and that mythical Chinese emperors and sages were really [...] "Korean". Shin also reconceived the [...] "Great Plan" [...] (Hungfan chin ch'ou 洪範九疇) given by Jizi of Gija Joseon as being made by [...] "a man of [...] ", turning China into an importer of Korean civilization, opposite to the traditional view.|$|E
2500|$|Korean ethnic {{nationalism}} {{is based on}} the idea that Koreans have existed as a single unique homogeneous race (tan'il minjok) since ancient times. As part of an effort to create a narrative of Korean origins free from [...] "racial contamination" [...] from Chinese or Japanese, racial histories of Koreans published in Korea usually begin with the line [...] "Koreans are not Japanese". As a result, the most politically correct proposed origins of <b>Koreans</b> <b>are</b> from southern Siberia (pukpang-gye), from the [...] "South Sea", or mythological (as in the Dangun story). The most influential articulation of these nationalist theories of origin is Kim Chŏng-hak's [...] "History of the formation of the Korean race" [...] (1964); others include Kim Chŏng-bae (1976, 1987, 1990), Yi Ki-baek (1977, [...] 1983), Kim Wŏl-lyong (1970, 1986, 1989b), Yun Mu-byŏng (1987), and Yi Chong-uk (1993). According to Shin Chaeho, the Korean people were the descendants of Dangun, who merged with the Buyeo (Fuyu) people of Manchuria and ended their development as the core of the Goguryeo people.|$|E

To back up its threat, it dispatched 20 gunboats to the area to conduct high seas seizure drills. In these circumstances, U.S. ambassador in Tokyo, Tom Schieffer stated [...] "The Ambassador stated the United States understands that Japan is within its rights under international law.

2500|$|In Korea the Joseon dynasty {{underwent}} a devastating war with newly unified Japan that lasted from 1592 to 1598. The shock of this encounter spurred {{the court to}} undergo a process of military strengthening. One of the core elements of military strengthening was to adopt the musket. According to reformers, [...] "In recent times in China {{they did not have}} muskets; they first learned about them from the Wokou pirates in Zhejiang Province. Qi Jiguang trained troops in their use for several years until they [...] became one of the skills of the Chinese, who subsequently used them to defeat the Japanese." [...] By 1607 Korean musketeers had been trained in the fashion which Qi Jiguang prescribed, and a drill manual had been produced based on the Chinese leader's Jixiao Xinshu. Of the volley fire, the manual says that [...] "every musketeer squad should either divide into two musketeers per layer or one and deliver fire in five volleys or in ten." [...] Another Korean manual produced in 1649 describes a similar process: [...] "When the enemy approaches to within a hundred paces, a signal gun is fired and a conch is blown, at which the soldiers stand. Then a gong is sounded, the conch stops blowing, and the heavenly swan [...] is sounded, at which the musketeers fire in concert, either all at once or in five volleys (齊放一次盡擧或分五擧)." [...] This training method proved to be quite formidable in the 1619 Battle of Sarhu when 10,000 Korean musketeers managed to kill many Manchus before their allies surrendered. While Korea went on to lose both wars against the Manchu invasions of 1627 and 1636, their musketeers were well respected by Manchu leaders. It was the first Qing emperor Hong Taiji who wrote: [...] "The <b>Koreans</b> <b>are</b> incapable on horseback but do not transgress the principles of the military arts.
