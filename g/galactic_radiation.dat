50|$|Ablestar was {{a liquid}} rocket stage burning hypergolic {{propellants}} fed from gas-pressurized propellant tanks. It {{was used as}} the upper stage, and provided improved performance. On April 13, 1960 a Thor-Ablestar launched Transit 1B, the first experimental satellite to demonstrate the feasibility of using satellites as navigation aids. On June 22, 1960, a Thor-Ablestar launched the first <b>Galactic</b> <b>Radiation</b> and Background (GRAB) electronic intelligence (ELINT) satellite for the United States Navy. These now-declassified satellites, operated under a cover story of providing solar radiation data, included an electronics package to detect Soviet air defense radar signals. GRAB-1 was thus the world's first successful reconnaissance satellite, preceding the first Corona mission to return film (Discoverer 14 on August 18) by almost two months. On 1961-06-29 the Ablestar stage used to launch Transit 4A became the first object to unintentionally explode in space, creating at least 294 trackable pieces of space debris.|$|E

Tattletale was also called Canes; CANES was also the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) sensitive compartmented information (SCI) codeword for the control system overall program.

50|$|The Naval Research Laboratory {{has been}} a crucial piece of the United States space program. Project Vanguard, the first American {{satellite}} program, tasked NRL with the design, construction and launch of an artificial satellite, which was accomplished in 1958. Vanguard I, designed and built at NRL, was the first solar-powered satellite. As of 2013, Vanguard I is still in orbit, making it the longest-lived man-made satellite. Vanguard II was the first satellite to observe the Earth's cloud cover and therefore the first meteorological satellite. NRL pioneered {{the study of the}} sun Ultraviolet and X-Ray spectrum. Along with Project Vanguard, NRL also designed the first satellite tracking system, Minitrack, which became the prototype for future satellite tracking networks. NRL's recently declassified <b>Galactic</b> <b>Radiation</b> and Background I (GRAB I) was the first U.S. intelligence satellite, intercepting Soviet radio communications from space. The Global Positioning System (GPS) was invented at NRL and tested by NRL prototype satellites Timation I and Timation II in 1967 and 1969, and the first operational GPS satellite, Timation IV (NTS-II) was designed and constructed at NRL.|$|E
50|$|He {{proposed}} {{and joined the}} international project to build the Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS), a project that included joint efforts from the United States, United Kingdom and the Netherlands, which made the first survey of the infrared sky from space, avoiding all atmospheric interference with observations, starting in 1983. Low served as the chief technologist for the project. After an accident at Jet Propulsion Laboratory destroyed preamplifiers used in the infrared detectors, Low led an effort at Infrared Laboratories to develop improved replacement units to resolve the crisis. IRAS was able to discover in excess of 500,000 infrared sources, including many galaxies, and has discovered shells of debris surrounding stars that show {{the early stages of}} planetary formation, with debris similar to that later found as the Kuiper belt that encircles our Solar System beyond the orbit of Neptune. Based on these findings, researchers have concluded that the majority of <b>galactic</b> <b>radiation</b> is emitted in the form of infrared radiation that is generated when light from young stars is absorbed by interstellar dust and then radiated from the dust in the form of heat. In 1984, IRAS found that the galaxy Arp 220, located 300 million light years from Earth, is the closest Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxy, emitting 100 times more energy than the Milky Way galaxy, primarily in the infrared spectrum, even though it is faintly visible by telescope using visible light.|$|E

50|$|This {{radiation}} originates {{from outside}} {{the solar system and}} consists of ionized charged atomic nuclei from hydrogen, helium and uranium.

40|$|The {{attenuation}} of {{very high}} energy gamma rays by pair production on the <b>Galactic</b> interstellar <b>radiation</b> field has long been thought of as negligible.

We have made a calculation of the attenuation {{of very high}} energy gamma rays in the Galaxy using this new interstellar radiation field which takes into account its nonuniform spatial and angular distributions. We find that the maximum attenuation occurs around 100 TeV {{at the level of}} about 25 % for sources located at the Galactic center, and is important for both Galactic and extragalactic sources.

40|$|A tissue-equivalent {{proportional}} counter (TEPC) {{sensitive to the}} lineal energy range of 0. 26 - 300 keV micrometer- 1 was flown on STS- 40 (39 degrees x 278 km x 296 km) inside the Spacelab. This instrument was previously flown on STS- 31 but was modified to provide a finer resolution at lower lineal energies to better map the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) protons. The instrument was turned on 6 June 1991, and operated for 7470 min (124. 5 h). The flight duration was characterized by {{a very large number}} of X-ray solar flares and enhanced magnetic field fluctuations; however, no significant dose from the solar particles was measured at the location of this instrument. The flight data can be separated into trapped and <b>galactic</b> cosmic <b>radiation</b> parts. The dose rate, dose-equivalent rate and quality factor for trapped radiation were 4. 21 +/- 0. 03 mrad day- 1, 7. 72 +/- 0. 05 mrem day- 1, and 1. 83 +/- 0. 1, respectively. The dose rate, dose-equivalent rate, and quality factor for <b>galactic</b> cosmic <b>radiation</b> were 5. 34 +/- 0. 03 mrad day- 1, 14. 63 +/- 0. 06 mrem day- 1, and 2. 74 +/- 0. 1, respectively. The overall quality factor for the flight was 2. 38. The dose from the GCR is higher than from SAA protons because of the high inclination and low altitude of this flight. The AP 8 MAX model of the trapped radiation gives a dose rate of 2. 43 mrad day- 1 and a quality factor of 1. 77. The CREME solar maximum model of <b>galactic</b> cosmic <b>radiation</b> gives a dose rate of 2. 54 mrad day- 1 and a quality factor of 2. 91. Thus the AP 8 MAX model underestimates the dose by a factor of 1. 8 whereas the CREME model leads to an underestimation of the dose by a factor of 2.
