25|$|In late 2012, {{the eternal}} flame began {{malfunction}}ing. The {{causes of the}} malfunction were not known, but the automatic ignition system began clicking audibly. On January 31, 2013, Meltech Corporation of Landover, Maryland, was awarded a $350,000 contract to upgrade the eternal flame. The work required that the permanent flame be extinguished, and a temporary flame displayed to one side.

40|$|Purpose: This {{document}} is intended solely {{as a quick}} reference guide for use by public health and environmental officials in evaluating data collected from structures in which mercury pressure regulating devices for natural gas meters were moved from inside to outside the structures {{as part of a}} modernization process. It does not provide detailed justifications for environmental sampling requirements, as health consultations or environmental sampling plans may do. In the past, ATSDR has been reluctant to provide a list of suggested action levels such as this because of the site specific nature of exposures. ATSDR has recognized that action levels can differ according to differing populations, exposure durations, concentrations, and specific hazards. However, the immediacy and extent of the potential health risk associated with mercury contamination in the present situation require publication of this guide. Many parts of the country may be affected by the possible exposure to mercury resulting from re-positioning of mercury-containing <b>gas</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>regulators</b> and the subsequent response efforts of gas utilities, public health and environmental officials. Moreover, the involvement of multiple health and environmental jurisdictions creates a need for consistency in presenting health risk information. Therefore, ATSDR, at the request of a state health department and an U. S. EPA regional office, is attempting to provide suggested action levels for various response activities under different exposure scenarios. Background: In this context, an action level is an indoor air concentration of mercury vapor, which should prompt consideration of the need to implement a recommended response by public health and environmental officials. The various suggested action levels provided in this document are intended as recommendations, not as regulatory values or cleanup values, although some may correspond to present or future values adopted by regulatory authorities. The suggested action levels presented in this document recognize that an individual must be exposed to a sufficient concentration over some specific period of time in order for mercury vapor to cause adverse health effects. The suggested action levels also recognize that while individual susceptibility may vary, developing fetuse...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to design, fabricate and test a single step pressure regulation system for the natural <b>gas</b> motorcycle. The <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> prototype design was based upon the fundamental principles of the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator.</b> The aid of Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD), pressure vessel code and threaded fastener standards were implied to design the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> prototype. The commercially available CFD code FLUENTTM was used to analyse and optimize the flow within the regulator. The structural design was based on the American Society of Mechanical Engineer (ASME) pressure vessel code. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) served as reference for threaded fasteners selection. The material selection achieved for the prototype design consists of stainless steel 304, TeflonTM and 3 ply elastomer as the selected material of choice. The final CFD evaluation provided an optimum opening of 3 mm between the obturator and valve seat. The <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> base has a wall thickness of 7. 5 mm while the bonnet cap has 11. 5 mm thickness. The loading element spring selected was a helical grounded type with 10 active coils and a wire diameter of 3 mm. The prototype designed was fabricated using Computer Numerical Configuration (CNC) machining as it is the best economically viable solution. The prototype performance was evaluated using the specially designed <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> test bench equipped with data acquisition and high <b>pressure</b> <b>gas</b> supply system. Outlet gas flow rates were steadily controlled from 5 to 25 litres per minute and the outlet pressure was found to be steady at 4. 5 bar.

40|$|The present paper {{describes}} a frequency spectrum classification method for fault {{diagnosis of the}} LP <b>gas</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> using Support Vector Machines. Conventional diagnosis methods are not efficient because of problems such as significant noise and nonlinearity of the detection mechanism. In order to solve these problems, a machine learning method with the Kullback-Leibler (KL) kernel based on the KL divergence is introduced into spectrum classification. We use the normalized frequency spectrum directly as input with the KL kernel. The proposed method demonstrates a higher accuracy than popular kernels, such as polynomial or Gaussian kernels, or the conventional fault diagnosis method and Gaussian Mixture Model with the KL kernel for the examined problem. The high classification performance is achieved by using an inexpensive sensor system and the machine learning method. This method is widely applicable to other spectrum classification applications without limitation on the generality if the spectrums are normalized. 1...|$|E
30|$|In recent years, a new coating technology, {{known as}} cold spraying, has been {{developed}} (Gärtner et al. 2006). In this process, spraying particles (1 to 50 μm in size) experiencing both a little change in microstructure and a little oxidation or decomposition are accelerated by a supersonic jet of a compressed gas stream passing through a Laval type nozzle to a very high velocity (300 to 1, 200 [*]m/s). The deposition system consists of a <b>gas</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator,</b> a gas heater, a powder feeder and a spray gun. In this technique, the deposited calcium orthophosphate particles are always in a solid state and at temperatures below their melting point. Thus, all phenomena occurring at high temperatures, such as thermal decomposition and phase transformations (see section[*]Thermal spraying techniques above), are avoided. Deposition of calcium orthophosphate particles takes place through intensive plastic deformations (Zhang and Zhang 2011; Zhang et al. 2012 a, 2012 b). However, for successful bonding, the deposited particles have to exceed a critical velocity on impacts, which {{is dependent on the}} properties of the particular sprayed material (Gärtner et al. 2006).|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} stable field {{emission}} (FE) current from sharp tungsten (W) tips in relatively poor vacuum (up to 10 - 2 mbar) conditions. We use small tip-anode spacing {{to keep the}} extraction voltage low. A simple current regulator circuit, with a bandwidth of ~ 1. 6 kHz, was designed, which controls the voltage applied according to the emission current measured. Without a current regulator circuit, an uncleaned W tip in unbaked 6 × 10 - 7 mbar system pressure cannot emit stable FE current and short-term fluctuations at a few nA current {{were found to be}} more than 300 %. The current regulator circuit improves the FE current stability dramatically. It was observed that at current level of ~ 3. 5 nA and regulation voltage of ~ 120 V the short-term fluctuations in the current were ~ 5 % at 6 × 10 - 7 mbar unbaked system pressure. Subsequently, the system pressure was increased in steps up to 10 - 3 mbar of argon gas and it was observed that the current regulator circuit worked at almost the same efficiency. Around 10 - 2 mbar of Ar <b>gas</b> <b>pressure</b> larger short-term fluctuations started appearing and around 10 - 1 mbar of Ar <b>gas</b> <b>pressure</b> the current <b>regulator</b> circuit failed to regulate the current.
