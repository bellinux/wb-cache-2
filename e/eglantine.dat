25|$|<b>Eglantine</b> (Banks) Took: (b. c.2935) Wife of Paladin Took II (the Thain from S.R. 1415 to 1434), {{and mother}} of their four {{children}} (born 2975 to 2990): three daughters, and a son, Peregrin Took.

60|$|For {{some reason}} or other, the Captain was {{particularly}} good-humoured; and, quite forgetful {{of the words}} which had passed between him and Mr. <b>Eglantine's</b> lieutenant the day before, began addressing the latter with extreme cordiality.|$|R
6000|$|In fact, {{it was his}} fixed {{purpose to}} pick a quarrel with Walker, and to drive him, if possible, from Mr. <b>Eglantine's</b> shop. [...] "Do you mean {{to give me the}} lie, I say, Mr. Hooker Walker?" ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{ten o'clock}} the next morning, a gentleman, with the King's {{button on his}} {{military}} coat, walked abruptly into Mr. <b>Eglantine's</b> shop, and, turning on Mr. Mossrose, said, [...] "Tell your master I want to see him." ...|$|R
25|$|The convoy escorts {{effectively}} intercepted attacks {{through the}} pre-dawn hours of 25 August. The calm sea conditions were favourable for the Type 271 centimeter-wavelength RADAR with {{which all the}} escorts were equipped, and prompt counter-attacks prevented the U-boats from reaching torpedo launch positions. A depth charge attack by <b>Eglantine</b> holed the conning tower of U-605. U-135, U-174 and U-438 were also damaged by depth charges. The shadowing U-boats lost contact after the convoy entered heavy fog after daybreak on 25 August, and discontinued pursuit on 26 August. U-256 was under repair {{for more than a}} year after being bombed in the Bay of Biscay on 31 August following depth charge damage from Viscount and Potentilla. U-438 aided U-256 reaching port, and U-174 refueled three Lohs U-boats before returning to France to repair damage. U-705 suffered several casualties when hit by gunfire from the convoy escorts; and was sunk in the Bay of Biscay by Armstrong Whitworth Whitleys of No. 77 Squadron RAF on 3 September.|$|E

6000|$|What Mr. <b>Eglantine's</b> {{relations}} were with Mr. Walker may be imagined {{from the following}} dialogue which took place between the two gentlemen at five o'clock one summer's afternoon, when Mr. Walker, issuing from his chambers, came across to the perfumer's shop:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|And Captain Walker walked {{towards his}} club, meditating on the beauties of Morgiana. [...] "What hair," [...] said he, [...] "what eyes the girl has! they're {{as big as}} billiard-balls; and five {{thousand}} pounds. <b>Eglantine's</b> in luck! five thousand pounds--she can't have it, it's impossible!" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Eglantine's</b> fine {{eyes were}} filled with tears as Morgiana passionately uttered the above {{beautiful}} words. Little Woolsey's eyes glistened, as he clenched his fist with an oath, and said, [...] "Show me any singing that can beat THAT. Cobbler, shut your mouth, or I'll break your head!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Pervinca Took: (b. 2985) Third {{daughter}} of Paladin II Took and <b>Eglantine</b> Banks, and thus one of Pippin's sisters. With {{her parents and}} siblings attended the Farewell Party of Bilbo Baggins (a relation of her father), where they were among his 144 special guests.|$|E
2500|$|Empire Buffalo was a [...] Design 1105 {{cargo ship}} {{which was built}} in 1919 as <b>Eglantine</b> by Skinner & Eddy for the United States Shipping Board (USSB). She was sold in 1933 to the Lykes Brothers-Ripley Steamship Corporation. In 1940 she was sold to the Ministry of War Transport (MoWT) and renamed Empire Buffalo. She was torpedoed and sunk by [...] in 1942.|$|E
2500|$|Peregrin was [...] born in [...] {{the only}} son of Paladin Took II and wife <b>Eglantine</b> Banks. He had three older sisters, Pearl Took, Pimpernel Took, and Pervinca Took. They {{were raised in}} the Tooks' Great Smials and their father's farm at Whitwell. In 3001 Pippin {{and his family were}} among the 144 special guests at the Farewell Party of Bilbo Baggins, a {{relative}} in Hobbiton.|$|E
60|$|In drawing villages, {{take great}} pains with the gardens; a rustic garden is {{in every way}} beautiful. If you have time, draw all the rows of cabbages, and hollyhocks, and broken fences, and {{wandering}} <b>eglantines,</b> and bossy roses: you cannot have better practice, nor be kept by anything in purer thoughts.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the sound}} of {{footsteps}} the pretty creature lifted her head, and when she saw her faithful companion approaching she bounded towards her, and rubbed her head on <b>Eglantine's</b> shoulder. The maid of honour was surprised; but she was fond of animals, and stroked the white doe tenderly, speaking gently to her all the while. Suddenly the beautiful creature lifted her head, and looked up into <b>Eglantine's</b> face, with tears streaming from her eyes. A thought flashed through her mind, and quick as lightning the girl flung herself on her knees, and lifting the animal's feet kissed them one by one. 'My princess! O my dear princess!' cried she; and again the white doe rubbed her head against her, for thought the spiteful fairy had taken away her power of speech, she had not deprived her of her reason! ...|$|R
60|$|Many a {{lady who}} {{purchased}} brushes at <b>Eglantine's</b> shop would have given ten guineas for such a colour as his when he saw her. His heart beat violently, he was almost choking in his stays: he had been prepared for the visit, but his courage failed him now it had come. They were both silent for some minutes.|$|R
2500|$|Paladin II Took (2933–3034): The {{only son}} of Adalgrim Took. He married <b>Eglantine</b> Banks; {{they had three}} daughters, and finally a son, Peregrin Took. In 2982 Paladin became heir {{presumptive}} to the Thainship; in 3015 he succeeded his second cousin, becoming [...] "the Took" [...] (head of the Took clan) and 31st Thain of the Shire. Paladin owned and farmed lands around Whitwell, near Tuckborough. When Lotho Sackville-Baggins took over the Shire, Paladin, as Thain, resisted him, and refused to acknowledge his rule. This led to skirmishing between the Tooks and Saruman's ruffians, who attempted to lay siege to the Tookland. When Merry and Pippin started their revolt, Paladin sent Pippin with 100 Tooks {{to aid in the}} Battle of Bywater.|$|E
2500|$|The Royal Norwegian Navy-manned Flower-class corvettes Andenes, <b>Eglantine,</b> Rose, Potentilla, and [...] from Escort Group A4, and the {{new leader}} F-class {{destroyer}} Fame were joined by the V-class [...] (which had been reconstructed as a long range escort), the Town-class destroyer Ramsey, and the British Flower-class corvettes Kingcup and Vervain.

60|$|As {{soon as she}} was {{somewhat}} recovered, and with the interruption of a thousand sobs, the poor thing told as well as she could her little story. Mr. <b>Eglantine</b> had arrested Mr. Walker: she had been trying to gain time for him; <b>Eglantine</b> had refused.|$|E
6000|$|But {{for these}} observations, {{which he did}} not hear, Captain Walker, it may be pronounced, did not care. His eyes brightened up, he marched quickly and gaily away; and turning into his own {{chambers}} opposite <b>Eglantine's,</b> shop, saluted that establishment with a grin of triumph. [...] "You wouldn't tell me her name, wouldn't you?" [...] said Mr. Walker. [...] "Well, the luck's with me now, and here goes." ...|$|R
5000|$|Les <b>églantines</b> sont peut-être formidables is {{the tenth}} album by {{experimental}} pop French musician Brigitte Fontaine and the eighth by Areski Belkacem, released in 1980 on the Saravah label. Because of its arrangements, described as almost [...] "disco" [...] by Fontaine herself, {{a sound that}} she can't stand, she has disowned the album and refused its re-release on CD, {{although it has been}} pressed in Japan in October 2008 by the Columbia Music Entertainment label.|$|R
