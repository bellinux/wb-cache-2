Hamilton developed the variational principle, which was reformulated later by Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. He also introduced the icosian game or Hamilton's puzzle which can be solved using the concept of a Hamiltonian path.|$|E
25|$|In 1916, {{following}} Romania's {{entry into}} World War I, Rainer returned to Bucharest and rejoined Marta, being called up for medical {{service as a}} Colonel. During the 1916 counteroffensive, the Rainers set up surgery wards in the hospitals that had become <b>full</b> <b>to</b> <b>overflowing</b> with wounded from the Battle of Turtucaia and the zeppelin attack on Bucharest. Later, during Bucharest's occupation by the Central Powers, Francisc Rainer established temporary hospitals in schools. He continued teaching under the German administration, so that his students would not miss a year, but was also obliged to teach separate courses for German students. He managed to prevent the occupying authorities from requisitioning the faculty's possessions. Viewed as political suspects, the Rainers were singled out for internment in Bulgaria, but spared by Minovici's intervention on his behalf. Marta Rainer, who managed war hospitals, organized teams of surgeons to help deal with the humanitarian crisis, and operated non-stop during the extremely cold winter of 1917–1918.|$|E

500|$|The midden closet was a {{development}} of the privy, which had evolved from the primitive [...] "fosse" [...] ditch. [...] Midden closets were still used {{in the latter part}} of the 19th century but were rapidly falling out of favour. [...] A Mr Redgrave, in a speech to the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1876, said that the midden closet represented [...] "... the standard of all that is utterly wrong, constructed as it is of porous materials, and permitting free soakage of filth into the surrounding soil, capable of containing the entire dejections from a house, or from a block of houses, for months and even years". [...] The 1868 Rivers Pollution Commission reported two years later: [...] "privies and ashpits are continually to be seen <b>full</b> <b>to</b> <b>overflowing</b> and as filthy as can be...These middens are cleaned out whenever notice is given that they need it, probably once half-yearly on an average, by a staff of night-men with their attendant carts." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Many algorithms, e. g. in {{the field}} of string matching, are based on {{handling}} many counters, which can be performed in parallel, even on a sequential machine, using bit-parallelism. The recently presented technique of nested counters (Matryoshka counters) [1] is to handle small counters most of the time, and refer to larger counters periodically, when the small counters may get <b>full,</b> <b>to</b> prevent <b>overflow.</b> In this work, we present several non-trivial applications of Matryoshka counters in string matching algorithms, improving their worst- or average-case time complexities. The set of problems comprises (δ, α) -matching, matching with k insertions, episode matching, and matching under Levenshtein distance. ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Furnival, {{when she}} had {{finished}} her letter and fastened it, drew one of the heavy dining-room arm-chairs over against the fire, and sat herself down to consider her past life, still holding the letter in her lap. She had not on that morning been very careful with her toilet, as was perhaps natural enough. The cares of the world were heavy on her, {{and he would not}} be there to see her. Her hair was rough, and her face was red, and she had hardly had the patience to make straight the collar round her neck. To the eye she was an untidy, angry, cross-looking woman. But her heart was <b>full</b> of tenderness,--full <b>to</b> <b>overflowing.</b> She loved him now as well as ever she had loved him:--almost more as the thought of parting from him pressed upon her!

500|$|While the Swan River Colony was {{established}} as a [...] "free settlement", by the 1840s the early reluctance to accept Britain's convicts was overcome. Cheap convict labour could overcome the [...] significant shortage of manpower in the colony. However, {{the arrival of the}} first convict ship Scindian on 2 June 1850 was unexpected. While a sailing ship had been sent ahead to inform of the pending arrival of seventy-five convicts, it had been blown off course. The Round House was <b>full</b> <b>to</b> capacity, almost <b>overflowing,</b> so the convicts had to be left on the ship. There was also no prepared accommodation for the warders, pensioner guards, Captain Edward Walcott Henderson, Comptroller General of Convicts, or his clerk, James Manning. Rents for accommodation in Fremantle quickly rose due to the sudden increase in demand, leaving Henderson paying more for his basic lodgings in Fremantle than for his house in London.|$|R

6000|$|Rheims is {{the most}} unspeakable and immeasurable horror and infamy--and what is appalling and heart-breaking is that it's [...] "for ever and ever." [...] But no words fill the abyss of it--nor touch it, nor relieve one's heart nor light by a spark the blackness; the ache of one's howl and the anguish of one's execration aren't mitigated by a shade, even as one brands it as the most hideous crime ever perpetrated against the mind of man. There it was--and now all the tears of rage of all the bereft {{millions}} and all the crowding curses of all the wondering ages will never bring a stone of it back! Yet one tries--even now--tries to get something from saying that the measure is so <b>full</b> as <b>to</b> <b>overflow</b> at last {{in a sort of}} vindictive deluge (though for all the stones that that will replace!) and that the arm of final retributive justice becomes by it an engine really in some degree proportionate to the act. I positively do think it helps me a little, to think of how they can be made to wear the shame, in the pitiless glare of history, forever and ever--and not even {{to get rid of it}} when they are maddened, literally, by the weight. And for that the preparations must have already at this hour begun: how can't they be as a tremendous force fighting on the side, fighting in the very fibres, of France?

60|$|It {{is curious}} and {{interesting}} to note the apparently insignificant instruments which God has seen fit {{to use in the}} carrying out of his plans. The smallest coral insect that builds its little cell in the southern seas exercises an influence in the production of the Gulf Stream. It has been said, with some degree of truth, that one such insect is capable of setting in motion the entire ocean! The coral insect has, in common with many other marine creatures, been gifted with the power of extracting from sea water the lime which it contains, in order to build its cell. The lime thus extracted leaves a minute particle of water necessarily destitute of that substance. Before that particle can be restored to its original condition of equality, every other particle of water in the ocean must part with a share of its superabundant lime! The thing must be done. That bereaved particle cannot rest without its lime. It forthwith commences to travel for the purpose of laying its brother-particles under contribution; and it travels far and wide--round and round the world. Myriads upon myriads of coral insects are perpetually engaged in thus robbing the sea water of its lime; shells are formed in a similar manner: so that our particle soon finds itself in company with innumerable other particles of water in a like destitute condition. It rises to the surface. Here the sun, as if to compensate it for the loss of its lime, bestows upon it an unusual amount of heat; and the surrounding particles, not to be outdone, make it almost unlimited presents of salt. <b>Full</b> <b>to</b> <b>overflow</b> with the gifts of its new companions, it hastens to bestow of its superabundance on less favoured particles; joins the great army of the ocean's currents; enters, perchance, the Gulf of Mexico, where it is turned back, and hastens along with the Gulf Stream, with all its natural warmth of character, to ameliorate the climate of Great Britain and the western shores of Europe. Having accomplished this benevolent work, it passes on, with some of its heat and vigour still remaining, to the arctic seas--where it is finally robbed of all its heat and nearly all its salt, and frozen into an icicle--there for many a long day to exert a chilling influence on the waters and the atmosphere around it. Being melted at last by the hot sun of the short arctic summer, it hurries back with the cold currents of the north to the genial regions of the equator, in search of its lost caloric and salt, taking in a full cargo of lime, etcetera, as it passes the mouths of rivers. Arrived at its old starting-point, our wanderer receives once more heat and salt <b>to</b> the <b>full,</b> parts with its lime, and at once hastens off on a new voyage of usefulness--to give out of its superabundance in exchange for the superabundance of others: thus quietly teaching man the lesson that the true principles of commerce were carried out {{in the depths of the}} sea ages before he discovered them and carried them into practice on its surface.|$|R
6000|$|Mine were assuredly urgent, but I {{found as}} the days went on that to believe what I [...] "liked" [...] was to believe what I was more and more intimately {{convinced}} of.

My obsession, as I may really call it and as I began to perceive, refused to be elbowed away, as I had hoped, by my sense of paramount duties. If I had {{a great deal to do}} I had still more to think about, and the moment came when my occupations were gravely menaced by my thoughts. I see it all now, I feel it, I live it over. It's terribly void of joy, it's <b>full</b> indeed <b>to</b> <b>overflowing</b> of bitterness; and yet I must do myself justice--I couldn't possibly be other than I was. The same strange impressions, had I to meet them again,'would produce the same deep anguish, the same sharp doubts, the same still sharper certainties. Oh, it's all easier to remember than to write, but even if I could retrace the business hour by hour, could find terms for the inexpressible, the ugliness and the pain would quickly stay my hand. Let me then note very simply and briefly that a week before our wedding-day, three weeks after her death, I became fully aware that I had something very serious to look in the face, and that if I was to make this effort I must make it on the spot and before another hour should elapse. My unextinguished jealousy--that was the Medusa-mask. It hadn't died with her death, it had lividly survived, and it was fed by suspicions unspeakable. They would be unspeakable to-day, that is, if I hadn't felt the sharp need of uttering them at the time.|$|R
