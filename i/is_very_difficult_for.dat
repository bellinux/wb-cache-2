5|$|Men have a {{unilateral}} right to divorce their wives (talaq) without needing any legal justification. The divorce is effective immediately. The husband's obligation is then to provide {{financial support for}} the divorced wife {{for a period of}} four months and ten days. A woman can only obtain a divorce with the consent of her husband or judicially if her husband has harmed her. In practice, it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> a Saudi woman to obtain a judicial divorce. The divorce rate is high, with 50% of marriages being dissolved. In the event of divorce, fathers have automatic custody of sons from the age of 7 and daughters from the age of 9. The right for men to marry up to four wives, combined with their ability to divorce a wife at any time without cause, can translate to unlimited polygamy. King Abdul Aziz, the founder of the country, reportedly admitted to marrying over two hundred women. However, his polygamy was considered extraordinary even by Saudi Arabian standards.|$|E
25|$|Muslims {{who wish}} to convert from Islam face severe obstacles. For Muslims, {{particularly}} ethnic Malays, the right to leave the Islamic faith and adhere to another religion is a controversial question. The legal process of conversion is also unclear; in practice it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> Muslims to change their religion legally.|$|E
25|$|Women face {{discrimination}} in the courts, where the testimony of one man equals that of two women in family and inheritance law. Polygamy is permitted for men, and men have a unilateral right to divorce their wives (talaq) without needing any legal justification. A woman can only obtain a divorce {{with the consent of}} her husband or judicially if her husband has harmed her. In practice, it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> a Saudi woman to obtain a judicial divorce. With regard to the law of inheritance, the Quran specifies that fixed portions of the deceased's estate must be left to the Qur'anic heirs and generally, female heirs receive half the portion of male heirs.|$|E

25|$|Still another {{technique}} {{relies on}} a dynamic grid of images that is different for each login attempt. The user must identify the pictures that fit their pre-chosen categories (such as dogs, cars and flowers). Only after they have correctly identified the pictures that fit their categories are they allowed to enter their alphanumeric password to complete the login. Unlike the static images used on the Bank of America website, a dynamic image-based authentication method creates a one-time passcode for the login, requires active participation from the user, and <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> a phishing website to correctly replicate because it would need to display a different grid of randomly generated images that includes the user's secret categories.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem with}} this {{sequence}} is in beat two: the grounded hind and foreleg are not diagonal pairs, but {{are on the same}} side of the horse (in this case, the outside). This means that the horse is balancing on only one side of its body, which <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the horse, making it hard to keep the animal balanced, rhythmical, and keeping impulsion. A horse that is cross-firing cannot perform to the best of its ability, and can even be dangerous (such as an unbalanced, cross-firing horse who must jump a huge, solid cross-country obstacle). Additionally, it makes for a very uncomfortable, awkward ride, producing a rolling movement often described as riding an eggbeater, which makes it difficult for the rider to perform to the best of his or her abilities.|$|E
25|$|Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium locally {{known as}} Kaloor Stadium is a {{multi-purpose}} international stadium situated in Kochi, Kerala. The stadium is used mostly for association football and cricket matches. With a maximum capacity of 75,000, {{it is one}} of the largest stadiums in India and the third largest cricket stadium in the world. The stadium was built in 1996 by the Government of Kerala with Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA). The stadium is widely touted to be one of the noisiest football stadiums in the world due to its distinctive architecture. In fact, the Kochi crowd is so vociferous that during international cricket matches, it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the umpires to hear minor edges off the bat by the ball for catches by the wicketkeeper. It is to be noted here that the stadium was originally built as a football stadium.|$|E

25|$|A species {{could benefit}} greatly from better {{abilities}} to reason about, predict {{and understand the}} world. French social and cognitive scientist Dan Sperber, with his colleague Hugo Mercier, describes {{the idea that there}} could have been other forces driving the evolution of reason. Sperber points out that reasoning <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> humans to do effectively, and that it is hard for individuals to doubt their own beliefs. Reasoning is most effective when it is done as a collective - as demonstrated by the success of projects like science. Sperber says this could suggest that there are not just individual, but group selection pressures at play. Any group that managed to find ways of reasoning effectively would reap benefits for all its members, increasing their fitness. This could also help explain why humans, according to Sperber, are not optimized to reason effectively alone. They also claim that reason may {{have more to do with}} winning arguments than with the search for the truth.|$|E
500|$|In July 2013, D’Esposito {{said he had}} {{considered}} making stand-alone shorts for several characters, including Loki, a young Nick Fury, Black Panther, Ms. Marvel, and Black Widow. Regarding Loki, D’Esposito said [...] "Being on Asgard <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> us {{to do in a}} short. It’s just impossible for us cost wise. The short would be 30 seconds, and it’s over. One shot of Loki on Asgard." [...] On Fury and Black Panther, he remarked [...] "It’s very complicated to do: who plays those characters? And designing the costume, getting it going … We tried. We were there in development, and we tried, but they were very difficult for all the reasons I gave. And we don’t want to do something that’s half baked because it’s not good for us and it’s not good for our fans." [...] In February 2014, Pearce mentioned other shorts that he had written that never came to fruition, including ones based on Sin and Crossbones, Jessica Jones, and Damage Control.|$|E

[...] In addition, it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> students, even of high-school age, to develop the rich sound characteristic of the euphonium, due partly to the instrument models used in schools and partly to the lack of awareness of good euphonium sound models.|$|E

[...] Clinton's decision to leave the Senate set off a scramble to determine who Governor of New York David Paterson would name to replace her, and resulted in the brief entry into politics for the first time of Caroline Kennedy.|$|E
2500|$|Legalese is an English term {{first used}} in 1914 for legal writing that <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> laymen {{to read and}} understand, the {{implication}} being that this [...] is deliberate for excluding the legally untrained and to justify high fees. Legalese, as a term, has been adopted in other languages. Legalese is characterized by long sentences, many modifying clauses, complex vocabulary, high abstraction, and insensitivity to the layman's {{need to understand the}} document's gist. Legalese arises most commonly in legal drafting, yet appears in both types of legal analysis. Today, the Plain Language Movement in legal writing is progressing and experts are busy trying to demystify legalese.|$|E
2500|$|The Society for Growing Australian Plants (now Australian Native Plants Society (Australia)) Eremophila Study Group {{has focused}} {{attention}} on propagating eremophila species {{with varying degrees of}} success. This eremophile has been seen as a highly desirable garden plant because of its density of flowers. [...] "It resembles a bridal veil blowing in the wind when in flower". Propagation from cuttings <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> this species and Grafting onto Myoporum rootstock is preferred for this species in domestic gardens to avoid the problems of suckering. Its frost tolerance, and hardiness in drought, makes it a species that is noted for inclusion in difficult gardens, however it can cause skin irritation in some people.|$|E

2500|$|The main {{method of}} {{transportation}} {{within the city}} is by small gasoline or electric powered motorcars referred to as [...] "autoettes". These include numerous golf carts and similarly-sized vehicles. Vehicles under [...] wide, [...] long, and less than [...] may qualify as an autoette. [...] Any resident may acquire an autoette permit with the restriction of one permit per household. It <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> a private citizen to get a permit to have a full-size vehicle in Avalon. The permit is issued to the individual {{as opposed to a}} specific vehicle, is surrendered when residency on the island ends, and is not transferable except through petition before the city council. Only one new vehicle permit is issued for every two permits that become ineligible to be renewed or are voluntarily surrendered. For purposes of vehicle registration, Catalina Island is divided into two classifications: within Avalon and [...] "Interior" [...] (areas outside the city limits). The city has its own strict permit program with which local vehicle owners must comply, in addition to the usual requirements imposed by the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Because of these restrictions, there is no regular vehicle ferry service for visitors to take their car to Avalon and the rest of Catalina Island.|$|E
2500|$|Steer roping —Not {{listed as}} an {{official}} PRCA event, and banned in several states, but quietly recognized by the PRCA in some areas. [...] It is rarely seen in the United States today because of the tremendous risk of injury to all involved, as well as animal cruelty concerns. [...] A single roper ropes the steer around the horns, throws the rope around the steer's back hip, dallies, and rides in a ninety-degree angle to the roped steer (opposite side from the aforementioned hip). [...] This action brings the steer's head around toward the legs {{in such a manner}} as to redirect the steer's head towards its back legs. [...] This causes the steer to [...] "trip". [...] Steers are too big to tie in the manner used for calves. [...] Absent a [...] "heeler," [...] it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> one person to restrain a grown steer once down.
