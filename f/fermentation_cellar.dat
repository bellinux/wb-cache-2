50|$|In 1996, {{construction}} {{began on}} a new <b>fermentation</b> <b>cellar</b> in the adjacent Coffee and Spice Building at 729 Q St. After completion of the construction in 1997, Empyrean Brewing Company and Lazlo's Brewery and Grill became separate financial entities under the Telesis umbrella. As production increased, K & Z Distributing of Lincoln and Miller Brands of Omaha begin distributing Empyrean beer.|$|E
50|$|Firestone Vineyard {{was founded}} {{by members of the}} Firestone family in 1972, as Santa Barbara County’s first estate winery. The winery was {{designed}} by Richard Keith & Associates, architects. The winery is located {{in the heart of the}} rural Santa Ynez Valley near the town of Los Olivos in Santa Barbara County. It includes a barrel cellar, <b>fermentation</b> <b>cellar,</b> crush pad, tasting room and bottling line for full production from the vine to the bottle. The winery is surrounded by 500 acre of estate vineyards. In early 2007, Firestone Vineyard opened a companion winery in Paso Robles, with a focus on small lots of Bordeaux varietals from select local vineyards.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} brewery {{was established}} on 1 June 1879 by Herman Meijling and J.H. Bartelink as the Hengelosche Stoom Beiersch Bierbrouwerij, translated as the Hengelo Steam Bavarian Beer Brewery. Beiersch Bier {{refers to the}} German state of Bavaria, home of an innovative method of brewing that soon became the standard in brewing lager beers. Like other Dutch brewers in the 19th century, Meijling and Bartelink adapted the Bavarian brewing process of lager beer, using bottom <b>fermentation</b> and <b>cellar</b> storages to mature the beer for several weeks. This approach resulted in typical clear lager, increased preservation and a smooth taste. The early adapters of this technology were able to increase their territory and market share, {{taking advantage of the}} extended sell by date.|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} studied Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeasts isolated from Nero d'Avola grapes, collected {{in different areas}} of the Sicily region. RAPD-PCR analysis with M 13 primer was used for preliminary discrimination among 341 S. cerevisiae isolates. Inoculated fermentations with S. cerevisiae strains, exhibiting different RAPD-PCR fingerprinting, revealed the impact of selected strains on volatile compound concentration. Two selected strains were used in <b>fermentation</b> at <b>cellar</b> level and the restriction analysis of mtDNA on yeast colonies isolated during fermentation was used to control strain implantation. This study represents an important step to establish a collection of indigenous S. cerevisiae strains isolated from a unique environment, such as Nero d'Avola vineyards. Different starter implantation throughout inoculated fermentation represents an additional character, which might be considered during the selection program for wine starter cultures...|$|R
25|$|Furthermore, {{the cold}} winter {{temperatures}} prematurely halted <b>fermentation</b> in the <b>cellars,</b> leaving dormant yeast cells that would awaken {{in the warmth}} of spring and start fermenting again. One of the byproducts of fermentation is the release of carbon dioxide gas, which, if the wine is bottled, is trapped inside the wine, causing intense pressure. The pressure inside the weak, early French wine bottles often caused the bottles to explode, creating havoc in the cellars. If the bottle survived, the wine was found to contain bubbles, something that the early Champenois were horrified to see, considering it a fault. As late as the 17th century, Champenois wine makers, most notably the Benedictine monk Dom Pérignon (1638–1715), were still trying to rid their wines of the bubbles.|$|R
5000|$|In 1854, brewer Johann Heinrich Ihring {{started the}} J.H. Ihring Brewery in Lich am Hardtberg. At this {{location}} {{there is a}} natural spring and a <b>fermentation</b> <b>cellar</b> for chilling the beer. Johann's father was known to provide the beer to the guests and residents of his guesthouse, which was called [...] "Zum goldenen Löwen" [...] ("The Golden Lion"). Since 1873, the steam-brewing process has been powered by a 6 HP motor. At the turn of the century, the company had brewed a total of 22,000 hectoliters. In 1911 the beer of the brewery was transported between locations with a single truck belonging to the brewery.|$|E
50|$|When the sugars in the fermenting beer {{have been}} almost {{completely}} digested, the fermentation process slows and the yeast cells begin to die and settle {{at the bottom of}} the tank. At this stage, especially if the beer is cooled to around freezing, most of the remaining live yeast cells will quickly become dormant and settle, along with the heavier protein chains, due simply to gravity and molecular dehydration. Conditioning can occur in fermentation tanks with cooling jackets. If the whole <b>fermentation</b> <b>cellar</b> is cooled, conditioning must be done in separate tanks in a separate cellar. Some beers are conditioned only lightly, or not at all. An active yeast culture from an ongoing batch may be added to the next boil after a slight chilling in order to produce fresh and highly palatable beer in mass quantity.|$|E
5000|$|The Ottakringer Brewery {{was opened}} in 1837 by the master miller Heinrich Plank {{under the name}} of Planksche Brauerei, after the ruling diocese of Klosterneuburg had granted {{approval}} for brewing. In 1850, it was taken over and expanded into a large brewery by the cousins, Ignaz and Jakob Kuffner from Lundenburg. Within ten years, the production increased from 18,318 [...] to 64,183 hl. When Kaiser Franz Joseph ordered that the city walls be pulled down and a large number of residential building began to be built, the Ottakringer Brewery grew as well. A new <b>fermentation</b> <b>cellar</b> and a larger warehouse went into operation. Around 1890, the production was already at about 170,000 hl. Moriz von Kuffner, the son of Ignaz von Kuffner, took over the brewery in 1882 and increased the production to over 350,000 hl in the last year before the war, a quantity which was not again reached between the World Wars. In 1905, Kuffner converted the brewery into a joint-stock company.|$|E
40|$|The long-time {{studies on}} wine yeasts have {{determined}} a wide diffusion of inoculated fermentations by commercial starters, mainly of Saccharomyces. Although {{the use of}} starter cultures has improved the reproducibility of wine quality, the main drawback to this practice {{is the lack of}} the typical traits of wines produced by spontaneous fermentation. These findings have stimulated wine-researchers and wine-makers towards the selection of autochthonous strains as starter cultures. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the biodiversity of 167 S. cerevisiae yeasts, isolated from spontaneous fermentation of grapes. The genetic variability of isolates was evaluated by PCR amplification of inter-δ region with primer pair δ 2 /δ 12. The same isolates were investigated for characteristics of oenological interest, such as resistance to sulphur dioxide, ethanol and copper and hydrogen sulphide production. On the basis of technological and molecular results, 20 strains were chosen and tested into inoculated fermentations at laboratory scale. The experimental wines were analyzed for the content of some by-products correlated to wine aroma, such as higher alcohols, acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate and acetic acid. One selected strain was used as starter culture to perform <b>fermentation</b> at <b>cellar</b> level. The selection program followed during this research project represents an optimal combination between two different trends in modern winemaking: the use of S. cerevisiae as starter cultures and the starter culture selection for specific fermentations...|$|R
2500|$|Today's {{winemaking}} {{for both}} traditionalists and modernists include strict hygiene controls {{and the use}} of some modern winemaking equipment. Rather than fall into one hardline camp or the other, many producers take a middle ground approach that utilizes some modernist techniques along with traditional winemaking. In general, the traditional approach to Nebbiolo involves long maceration periods of 20 to 30 days {{and the use of}} older large botti size barrels. The modern approach to Nebbiolo utilizes shorter maceration periods of 7 to 10 days and cooler fermentation temperatures between [...] that preserve fruit flavors and aromas. Towards the end of the <b>fermentation</b> period, the <b>cellars</b> are often heated to encourage the start of malolactic fermentation which softens some of Nebbiolo's harsh acidity. Modern winemakers tend to favor smaller barrels of new oak that need only a couple years to soften the tannic grip of the wines. As new oak imparts notes of vanilla, {{it has the potential to}} cover up the characteristic rose notes of Nebbiolo.|$|R
40|$|Program and abstracts of the In Vino Scientia 2005; Poster 59, page 113. Vinifera Tempranillo grapes were {{collected}} in two consecutive crops (2002 and 2003) and monitored in their early stages of <b>fermentation</b> undel real <b>cellar</b> production conditions at EVENA (the Station of Viticulture and Enology of Navarra). Parameters such as pluviometry, day-night contrast temperatures, pH, density, polyphenols, metals (Fe, Cu, Zn and Mn) and several colour variables were measured. A similar pattern was observed for both polyphenols and metals contents evolutions {{in the two years}} study, although different absolute values were obtained which correlate to the diverse climatic conditions occurring along the grape growing stages. Spectrophotometric analysis were carried out of the samples at different fermentation times, and changes in colour were monitored after exogenous addition of certain metals. Metals such as Fe and Cu showed a concentration profile vs. fermentation time that resembles closely those of "blue" and "yellow" absorbances in the same period of feermentation. Shiftings of the maximum wavelenghts took place and the influence of polyphenols over the "brightness" and "red" parameters was checked...|$|R
50|$|The {{gardens of}} the château were created between 1717 and 1724 by Alexandre Eutrope de Lur Saluces. They were {{inspired}} by the gardens that he saw in Florence during his grand tour of Italy and his time spent at the court in Versailles. The park has a wide central axis and two terraces, with groups of statues and vases. The statues were done by Italian artists brought there for that purpose {{in the early part}} of the 18th century, and represent figures from Greek mythology: Cephalus, Aurora, Cupid, Aphrodite (Venus), Adonis, and Flora, the goddess of flowers and gardens. Other statues represent wine-making, the joys of the hunt and fishing, wine and intoxication. To the east of the first terrace is a small theater, decorated with figures from the Italian commedia dell'arte: Pantalone, Scaramouche and Harlequin. A stairway leads to a second terrace, where there are statues symbolizing of earth, wind, air and fire.The estate has, over the centuries, known numerous trials and tribulations. Both good and bad fortune. The Château was not inhabited regularly for practically two generations. In the early fifties Pierre de Bournazel took over the property inherited from his uncle and godfather, Pierre de Lur-Saluces. He was a man possessed by a love of the land and of stone and he decided to re-instil life into the buildings and vineyards which undeniably were in a state of considerable neglect. He rebuilt the <b>fermentation</b> <b>cellar,</b> studied estate management, followed a course in oenology and together, with the help of his wife, made it a point of honour to re-establish the initial shape and form of the rooms of the Château whilst retaining their original appearance.|$|E
40|$|Chinese strong-flavored liquor (CSFL) {{accounts}} for more than 70 % of all Chinese liquor production. Microbes in pit mud play key roles in the <b>fermentation</b> <b>cellar</b> for the CSFL production. However, microbial diversity, community structure, and cellar-age-related changes in pit mud are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the prokaryotic community structure and diversity in pit-mud samples with different cellar ages (1, 10, 25, and 50 years) using the pyrosequencing technique. Results indicated that prokaryotic diversity increased with cellar age until the age reached 25 years and that prokaryotic community structure changed significantly between three cellar ages (1, 10, and 25 years). Significant correlations between prokaryotic communities and environmental variables (pH, NH 4 +, lactic acid, butyric acid, and caproic acid) were observed. Overall, our study results suggested that the long-term brewing operation shapes unique prokaryotic community structure and diversity as well as pit-mud chemistry. We have proposed a three-phase model to characterize the changes of pit-mud prokaryotic communities. (i) Phase I is an initial domestication period. Pit mud is characterized by abundant Lactobacillus and high lactic acid and low pH levels. (ii) Phase II is a transition period. While Lactobacillus abundance decreases dramatically, that of Bacteroidetes and methanogens increases. (iii) Phase III is a relative mature period. The prokaryotic community shows the highest diversity and capability to produce more caproic acid as a precursor for synthesis of ethyl caproate, the main flavor component in CSFL. This research provides scientific evidence to support the practical experience that old fermentation cellars produce high-quality liquor...|$|E

40|$|The in-bottle {{fermentation}} of sparkling wines {{is currently}} triggered by few commercialized Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. This lack {{of diversity in}} tirage yeast cultures leads to a prevalent uniformity in sensory profiles of the end products. The {{aim of this study}} has been to exploit the natural multiplicity of yeast populations in order to introduce variability in sparkling wines throughout the re-fermentation step. A collection of 133 S. cerevisiae strains were screened on the basis of technological criteria (fermenting power and vigor, SO 2 tolerance, alcohol tolerance, flocculence) and qualitative features (acetic acid, glycerol and H 2 S productions). These activities allowed the selection of yeasts capable of dominating the in-bottle <b>fermentation</b> in actual <b>cellar</b> conditions: in particular, the performances of FX and FY strains (isolated in Franciacorta area), and OX and OY strains (isolated in Oltrepò Pavese area), were compared to those of habitually used starter cultures (IOC 18 - 2007, EC 1118, Lalvin DV 10), by involving nine wineries belonging to the two Consortia of Appellation of Origin. The microbiological analyses of samples have revealed that the indigenous strains showed an increased latency period and a higher cultivability along the aging time than the commercial starter cultures do. Results of chemical analyses and sensory evaluation of the samples after 18 months sur lies have shown that significant differences (p < 0. 05) were present among the strains for alcoholic strength, carbon dioxide overpressure and pleasantness, whereas they were not observed for residual sugars content, titratable acidity or volatile acidity. Indigenous S. cerevisiae exhibited comparable values respect to the commercial starter cultures. The ANOVA has also proven that the base wine formulation is a key factor, by significantly affecting (p < 0. 01) some oenological parameters of wine, like alcoholic strength, volatile acidity, carbon dioxide overpressure, titratable acidity and dry extract. The use of native yeast strains for the re-fermentation step can be considered a convenient way for introducing differentiation to the final product without modifying the traditional technology. In a perspective of “precision enology,” where the wine is designed on specific vine cultivars and microorganisms, this work underlines that exploring yeast biodiversity is a strategic activity to improve the production...|$|R
