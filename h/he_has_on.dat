5|$|The plot of Arrested Development {{revolves}} around {{the members of the}} Bluth family, a formerly-wealthy family who continue to lead extravagant lifestyles despite their changed circumstances and who often find themselves drawn into interactions with incestuous undertones. At the center of the show is Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman), the show's straight man, who strives {{to do the right thing}} and keep his family together, despite their materialism, selfishness, and manipulative natures. Michael is a widowed single father. His teenage son, George Michael (Michael Cera), has the same qualities of decency but feels a constant pressure to live up to his father's expectations and is often reluctant to follow his father's plans. He battles with a crush <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>on</b> cousin Maeby, which developed from a kiss she gave him as part of a prank.|$|E

The description matches the portrait.|$|E

Apart from certain limitations {{of nature and}} law, <b>he</b> <b>has,</b> <b>on</b> a caretaker basis, the same obligations and powers as a Diocesan Bishop (canons 427–429 of the Code of Canon Law). Occasionally an Apostolic Administrator is appointed by the Holy See to run a vacant diocese, or even a diocese whose bishop is incapacitated or otherwise impeded.|$|E

25|$|With Chase Manhattan Bank {{demanding}} repayment, Trump sold {{controlling interest}} of the project to a consortium of Hong Kong- and China-based investors called Polylinks in June 1994. The Hong Kong and China consortium Polylinks International Ltd., represented by real estate broker Susan Cara, paid $82 million to Chase to obtain the property, after renegotiating both Trump's business and personal debt down from $300 million. This joint venture finally put in motion the largest private development project in New York City history. Trump remained as {{the public face of}} the group, as <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>on</b> many other projects, but he lost control. Due to the weak economy, as well as significant community opposition, construction was delayed for several years as lawsuits were resolved and the new investors sought public financing. Trump was accused of political payoffs to Republican State Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno in return for the latter's prospective approval of a state low-interest mortgage for the project. The state mortgage was never granted.|$|E
500|$|Jack Thompson (portrayed by Chad Michael Murray) is a {{war veteran}} and agent with the SSR who accidentally killed {{surrendering}} enemy soldiers, but hid the mistake, instead being praised as a hero. He takes the credit for Carter's work in defeating Leviathan, and is promoted to Chief of the New York SSR office. Thompson is shot by a mysterious person looking to take a redacted case file <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>on</b> [...] "M. Carter".|$|E
500|$|Club member Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) {{establishes}} a one-man tribute band to teen singer Justin Bieber, {{which he calls}} [...] "The Justin Bieber Experience", {{in the hope of}} winning over his girlfriend Quinn (Dianna Agron), whom he suspects still has feelings for her ex-boyfriend Finn (Cory Monteith). Sam performs Bieber's [...] "Baby" [...] for the glee club, and dedicates it to Quinn; the performance also excites the other girls in the club. Several of the male members—Puck (Mark Salling), Artie (Kevin McHale) and Mike (Harry Shum, Jr.)—are impressed by the effect <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>on</b> the girls, and convince him to let them join his tribute band. The foursome then perform [...] "Somebody to Love", and recreate the music video for the song in the auditorium to the girls' delight. Quinn chooses Sam over Finn, but when Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) convinces Sam that Quinn cheated on him, he breaks up with her and begins dating Santana.|$|E

500|$|On the review-aggregating website Metacritic, Indestructible {{received}} {{a score of}} 57%, based on six reviews. Being the first self-produced effort by the band, they had more leeway to create music without any outside interference, suggests 411mania writer Dan Marsicano. He concludes that the self-production also led {{to a lack of}} guidance, though, which ultimately works against the album, rather than helping it. Guitarist Dan Donegan's guitar work was praised, and About.com writer Chad Bowar notes many songs on the album are guitar-driven. Metaleater writer Chris Akin also praises Donegan, saying, [...] "If there is growth in the band, it's in the guitars. Dan Donegan takes a much more 80s approach than <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>on</b> past recordings." [...] AllMusic writer James Monger praised Indestructible, suggesting that rather than taking melodic elements from acts like Pantera, like Disturbed's previous records are suggested to, the album takes musical elements from acts such as Metallica or AC/DC.|$|E
500|$|Ellie Goulding and Fitz and the Tantrums {{were signed}} as the opening act {{for the first}} leg of tour in North American. Marx recollected that the team {{approached}} several agencies and asked for suggestions. In the end, Mars decided to pick Goulding, who was seen as someone who could assure sales. Marx was pleased with the tour development since everyone's efforts from The Smeezingtons to the label Atlantic Records proved to be fruitful to it. Despite having booked tours for acts such as Lady Gaga, Peter Gabriel, and Justin Timberlake, Marx confessed that booking this tour was among his most exhilarating experiences during the 37 years of career <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>on</b> touring. He added that the setup had also been [...] "unique and special". The stage configuration would vary according to the sales, having three different configurations available before selling seats in over 180-degrees arcs from the stage. Nevertheless, due to the success, expectation was to go [...] "into 240-degrees" [...] and further; they ended up by opening and selling 270-degrees arcs from the stage and consequently breaking records in several venues, but they did everything to assure that all seats were suitable to experience the show the best way possible.|$|E
500|$|The {{direction}} of the band is dominated by chief guitarist, lead vocalist, and principal songwriter Billy Corgan. Journalist Greg Kot wrote, [...] "The music [...] would not be what it is without his ambition and vision, and his famously fractured relationships with his family, friends, and bandmembers." [...] Melissa Auf der Maur commented upon news of the group's reunion, [...] "Everyone knows Billy doesn't need too many people to make a Pumpkins record, other than Jimmy —who <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>on</b> board." [...] In a 2015 interview Corgan himself referred to the current iteration of the band [...] "as sort of an open source collective" [...] noting that [...] "It's whoever feels right at the time.". Many of Corgan's lyrics for the Pumpkins are cathartic expressions of emotion, full of personal musings and strong indictments of himself and those close to him. Music critics were not often fans of Corgan's angst-filled lyrics. Jim DeRogatis wrote in a 1993 Chicago Sun-Times article that Corgan's lyrics [...] "too often sound like sophomoric poetry", although he viewed the lyrics of later albums Adore and Machina as an improvement. Corgan responded to DeRogatis' words with [...] "fuck the Sun-Times", at the band's 1993 show at the Metro Chicago.|$|E

500|$|Tucci {{was one of}} {{the last}} actors cast; he agreed to play Nigel only three days before {{shooting}} started. The filmmakers reportedly had auditioned Barney's creative director Simon Doonan and E!'s Robert Verdi, both openly gay men highly visible as media fashion commentators, for the part; the BBC's Graham Norton also auditioned. Verdi would later claim there was no intention to actually hire him and the producers had just used him and Doonan to give whoever they ultimately did cast some filmed research to use in playing a gay character (he would end up with a walk-on part as a fashion journalist in Paris). Tucci claims he was unaware of this: [...] "All I know is that someone called me and I realized this was a great part." [...] He based the character on various people he was acquainted with, insisting on the glasses he ultimately wore. Daniel Sunjata had originally read for Tucci's part, rather unenthusiastically since he had just finished playing a similar character, but then read the Holt part and asked if he could audition for it. Simon Baker auditioned by sending a video of himself, wearing the same self-designed green jacket <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>on</b> when he and Andrea meet for the first time.|$|E
500|$|Zur's {{compositions}} {{frequently are}} focused on full orchestras, choir and, in some games like Prince of Persia, ethnic instruments like Arabic flutes and the woodwind duduk. He has often collaborated with the Northwest Sinfonia orchestra from Seattle, though <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>on</b> occasion used other orchestras. Whenever Zur works with a real orchestra, he always conducts it himself. He has named some of his musical influences as classical artists such as Sergey Prokofiev, Igor Stravinsky, and Beethoven, movie composers like John Williams and Jerry Goldsmith, and jazz artists like George Gershwin and Henry McFeeny. While he would one day like to compose music {{not intended to be}} part of a larger piece of media, he finds that the pressure of a deadline and the feedback from the developers are crucial in his development process. He feels that his music sounds best when it is in the context given by the media it was made for, though he feels that performances of the music by itself transforms it [...] "from just a soundtrack to an art form on its own". Zur sometimes collaborates with other musicians while composing his game soundtracks; for example, he worked with Florence and the Machine to create a unique rendition of [...] "I’m Not Calling You A Liar" [...] for the Dragon Age II soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|Bart's rebellious {{attitude}} {{has made him}} a disruptive student at Springfield Elementary School, where Bart is an underachiever and proud of it. He is constantly at odds with his teacher Ms. Krabappel, Principal Skinner, and occasionally Groundskeeper Willie. Bart does poorly in school and is well aware of it, having once declared, [...] "I am dumb, okay? Dumb as a post! Think I'm happy about it?" [...] On one occasion, Lisa successfully proves that Bart is dumber than a hamster, although Bart ultimately outsmarts her in the end. In [...] "Separate Vocations" [...] (season three, 1992) Bart becomes hall monitor and his grades go up, suggesting that he struggles mainly because he does not pay attention, not because he is stupid. This idea is reinforced in [...] "Brother's Little Helper", (season eleven, 1999) in which it is revealed that Bart suffers from attention deficit disorder. His lack of smarts can also be attributed to the hereditary [...] "Simpson Gene", which affects the intelligence of most male members of the Simpson family. Although he gets into endless trouble and can be sadistic, shallow and selfish, Bart also exhibits many qualities of high integrity. <b>He</b> <b>has,</b> <b>on</b> a few occasions, helped Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel: In [...] "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song" [...] (season five, 1994), Bart accidentally got Skinner fired and befriended him outside the school environment. Bart missed having Skinner as an adversary and got him rehired, knowing that this would mean that the two could no longer be friends.|$|E

2500|$|Ellis has {{himself in}} very direct terms criticized {{opposing}} approaches such as psychoanalysis, transpersonal psychology and abreactive psychotherapies {{in addition to}} on several occasions questioning some of the doctrines in certain religious systems, spiritualism and mysticism. Many, including REBT practitioners, have warned against dogmatizing and sanctifying REBT as a supposedly perfect psychological panacea. Prominent REBTers have promoted the importance of high quality and programmatic research, including originator Ellis, a self-proclaimed [...] "passionate skeptic". <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>on</b> many occasions been open to challenges and acknowledged errors and inefficiencies in his approach and concurrently revised his theories and practices. In general, with regard to cognitive-behavioral psychotherapies' interventions, others {{have pointed out that}} as about 30–40% of people are still unresponsive to interventions, that REBT could be a platform of reinvigorating empirical studies on the effectiveness of the cognitive-behavioral models of psychopathology and human functioning.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1970s, Koontz {{began writing}} {{suspense}} and horror fiction, both {{under his own}} name and several pseudonyms, sometimes publishing up to eight books a year. Koontz has stated that he began using pen names after several editors convinced him that authors who switched {{back and forth between}} different genres invariably fell victim to [...] "negative crossover" [...] (alienating established fans and simultaneously failing to pick up any new ones). Known pseudonyms used by Koontz during his career include Deanna Dwyer, K. R. Dwyer, Aaron Wolfe, David Axton, Brian Coffey, John Hill, Leigh Nichols, Owen West, Richard Paige, and Anthony North.
