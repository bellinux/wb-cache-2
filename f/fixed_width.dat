500|$|To {{deal with}} these limitations, Frye {{simplified}} the maze's intricate pattern of corridors to a more repetitive pattern. The small tan pellets in the arcade original were changed to rectangular [...] "wafers" [...] that shared the wall color on the 2600, a change necessitated because both the pellets and walls were drawn with the 2600's Playfield graphics, which have a <b>fixed</b> <b>width.</b> To achieve the visual effect of wafers disappearing as Pac-Man eats them, the actual map of the maze was updated as the data was written into the Playfield registers, excluding those pellets that had been eaten. The 2600's Player-Missile graphics system (sprites) {{were used for the}} remaining objects, the one pixel-wide Missiles were used to render the flashing power pills and the center of the vitamin. [...] Pac-Man and ghost characters were implemented using the 2600's two Player objects, with one being used for Pac-Man and the other being used in for all four ghosts, with the result that each ghost only appears once out of every four frames, which creates a flickering effect. This effect takes advantage of the slow phosphorescent fade of CRT monitors and the concept of persistence of vision, resulting in the image appearing to linger on screen longer, but the flickering remains noticeable, and makes each individual ghost's color nearly impossible to discern. Frye chose to abandon plans for a flicker-management system to minimize the flashing in part because Atari didn't seem to care about that issue in its zeal to have the game released. His game also did not conform to the arcade game's color scheme in order to comply with Atari's official home product policy that only space type games should feature black backgrounds. [...] Another quality-impact was his decision that two-player gameplay was important, which meant that the 23 bytes required to store the current difficulty, state of the dots on the current maze, remaining lives, and score had to be doubled for a second player, consuming 46 of the 2600's meager 128 byte memory, which precluded its use for additional game data and features.|$|E
50|$|The {{width of}} a problem is the width of its minimal-width decomposition. While decompositions of <b>fixed</b> <b>width</b> {{can be used to}} {{efficiently}} solve a problem, a bound on the width of instances does necessarily produce a tractable structural restriction. Indeed, a <b>fixed</b> <b>width</b> problem has a decomposition of <b>fixed</b> <b>width,</b> but finding it may not be polynomial. In order for a problem of <b>fixed</b> <b>width</b> being efficiently solved by decomposition, one of its decompositions of low width has to be found efficiently. For this reason, decomposition methods and their associated width are defined in such a way not only solving the problem given a fixed-width decomposition of it is polynomial-time, but also finding a <b>fixed</b> <b>width</b> decomposition of a fixed-width problem is polynomial-time.|$|E

50|$|The {{origin of}} this idea is uncertain. Keltner was a Chicago grain trader and perhaps it was common {{knowledge}} among traders of the day.
