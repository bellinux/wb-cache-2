50|$|Another {{advantage}} of some soft molded trailers—particularly split eel trailers—is {{that when a}} fish sucks the lure into its mouth, the trailer tails can catch on the <b>gill</b> <b>rakes.</b> This prolongs {{the time it takes}} the fish to spit out the lure and gives the angler another second to react and set the hook.|$|E
5000|$|More than 15 scale rows {{occur on}} the killifish’s body between the pelvic fin and the isthmus, as well as 31-39 {{longitudinal}} scale rows. [...] Additionally, an average of 17-20 individual scales are seen around the caudal peduncle. [...] Also, 12-19 faint stripes are found {{along the side of}} the killifish. [...] The killifish also has five pairs of mandibular pores, which are sensory pores located on the underside of the lower jaw, part of the lateral line sensory system. [...] Around 9-12 <b>gill</b> <b>rakes,</b> 10-12 dorsal rays, 9-11 anal rays, and six pelvic rays are present.|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{buccopharyngeal}} cavity anatomy of 20 {{male and female}} trairão, Hoplias lacerdae (Miranda Ribeiro, 1908) specimens, with 24. 41 cm average standard-length, fixed in 4 % formalin aqueous solution and/or diaphanized and colored with alizarin and alcian blue. The anatomical characteristics of the H. lacerdae buccopharyngeal cavity are: thin lips adherent to the respective maxilla; oral dentition consisting of canine and conical teeth, implanted in the premaxillary, maxillary and dentary arches, and conical teeth in the ectopterygoid and accessory ectopterygoid; smooth tongue, with free apex; dentigerous plates, with conical teeth covering gill arches on the external and internal faces; few <b>gill</b> <b>rakes</b> in gill arch I, with denticles; pharyngeal dental apparatus developed, with conical teeth implanted in the II, III and IV pharyngobranchial and V ceratobranchial cartilage; mucosal layer without significant relief. These characteristics confirm the trairão as being carnivorous in habit, preferentially ictiophagous...|$|E
40|$|The morphology, abundance, {{condition}} factor and length-w eight relationship of Ethmalosa fimbriatafrom Nkoro River in the Niger Delta area of Nigeria was studied from January-December 2008. The bodydescription of E. fimbriata from Nkoro River was; Dorsal spine (total) : 0, Dorsal soft rays(total) : 16 - 19, Analspine: 0, Anal soft rays: 19 - 23. The m outh is sharply upw ard and V-shaped. Caudal fin is deep chrome withlong and pointed tips. The upper jaw contains distinct median notch, into which tip of lower jaw fits. Lowergill rakes are long, fine and numerous, often 3 {{times as long}} as gill filaments; upper <b>gill</b> <b>rakes</b> bent. There isa faint dark spot behind gill cover sometimes followed by others. The dorsal fin tip is black with golden tintson the body. The scute is 16 - 19, pre-pelvic, 10 - 13 post and scales in lateral series is 37 - 42. The highest catchwas recorded in January (8. 16), followed by February (4. 21), May (1. 65), March (1. 40), April (1. 11) andOctober (1. 10). June (0. 87), December (0. 32), November (0. 20) and July (0. 14) were less than 1. No catch wasrecorded for August and September during the study. T he highest catch per unit effort (5. 62) w as recorded instation 2, followed by station 1 (5. 04) and station 4. The least catch per unit effort (3. 75) was recorded in station 3. From a sample size of 1200 specimens, K value was 0. 946 and the exponential equation was Wt = 0. 162 (TL) 3. 199, indicating an isometric growth pattern. The highest {{condition factor}} value (1. 00) was recorded in Mayand the lowest (0. 6) in September. This was {{an indication that the}} beginning of rains favors E. fimbriata thanmid rains...|$|E
