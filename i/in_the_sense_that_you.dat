He explained that [...] "when you're playing a character of solid blackness, {{that in itself is}} very interesting, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have no other motivation other than the accumulation of power. It's not so much about not having a moral center, it's just that the only thing that mattered is increasing power." [...] He admitted, [...] "I've been trying to find a redeeming feature to Palpatine, and the only one I've got so far is that he's clearly a patron of the arts because he goes to the opera." [...] McDiarmid compared the character to Iago from William Shakespeare's Othello: ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the script}} of [...] "The Gathering", Tessa is {{described}} as [...] "...a beautiful, elegantly casual woman, artist, free spirit, and proprietor {{of the most unusual}} antique shop in the city." [...] The script of the episode [...] "Saving Grace" [...] says that she has grace and style. Tessa is portrayed as a tall, thin woman with blonde hair and blue eyes. Because Highlander: The Series was an international co-production, the producers cast a French-speaking actor to play Tessa. Producer Gary Goodman explained that they wanted someone [...] "...that would be appealing on a television screen... <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were comfortable with her accent and her character". They chose Belgian actress Alexandra Vandernoot because she [...] "...was able to be exotic, pretty and not so unfamiliar to an American audience that she was accepted." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} almost universally well {{received}} by the music press upon release, with Jon Landau in the newly launched Rolling Stone magazine noting that [...] "When the Byrds get it together on record they are consistently brilliant." [...] Landau went on to praise the Byrds' musical eclecticism, before stating: [...] "Their music is possessed by a never-ending circularity and a rich, child-like quality. It has a timelessness to it, not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> think their music will always be valid, but {{in the sense that}} it is capable of forcing you to suspend consciousness of time altogether." [...] Crawdaddy! magazine was also enthusiastic in its praise of the album, with Sandy Pearlman describing it as [...] "enchantingly beautiful". Pete Johnson, in his review for the Los Angeles Times, summed up the album as [...] "11 good songs spiked with electronic music, strings, brass, natural and supernatural voices, and the familiar thick texture of McGuinn's guitar playing".|$|E

500|$|... "Exit" [...] {{was created}} {{on the final}} day of {{recording}} for The Joshua Tree. It developed from a lengthy jam that the band recorded in a single take. Producer Daniel Lanois said, [...] "it was a long jam, and there was just this one section of it that had some kind of magic to it, and we just decided to turn it into something." [...] Producer Brian Eno edited the jam down to the end length. Guitarist the Edge said, [...] "it started off as an exercise in playing together with a kind of mood and a place in mind. And it really, for me, it brought me there, it really did succeed as an experiment." [...] Lanois said: [...] "There's something that happens when U2 bash it out in the band room... and sometimes things get out of control, sonically, in a good way. Out of control <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't know what it is anymore, it just takes on a life of its own, and it makes people do things." ...|$|E
2500|$|Qs Tom Doyle {{hailed the}} album, saying, [...] "These 10 {{magnificent}} songs see the singer and lyricist {{trying to get}} his head around life, death, love, the universe and what he calls 'the mysteries of the human heart'... Always musically sure-footed and prog-minded – less, of course, in terms of never-ending solos; more <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> never know what's up next sonically – here Elbow stretch themselves musically without tearing up their original blueprint... Topping even The Seldom Seen Kid, The Take Off... is the perfect expression yet of everything that is Elbow. As their best album to date, it will lift yor heart and fill your soul." [...] Referring to the group's concert at Jodrell Bank in 2012, Mojos Victoria Segal noted, [...] "You don't need the world's largest radio telescope to pick up the issues of mortality and make-or-break change pulsing through the record... Plotting their course through these highs and lows – those take-offs and landings – Elbow are no clearer than anyone else about how they will reach the final destination. By sharing that uncertainty and navigating by what little light there is, artistically, at least, they never lose their way." ...|$|E

What I {{maintained}} was that although you knew more about Zulus <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are a scientist, I know more about them in the sense that I am a savage. For instance, your theory of the origin of language, something about its having come from the formulated secret language of some individual creature, though you knocked me silly with facts and scholarship in its favour, still does not convince me, because I have a feeling that that is not the way that things happen. If you ask me why I think so I can only answer that I am a Zulu; and if you ask me (as you most certainly will) what is my definition of a Zulu, I can answer that also. He is one who has climbed a Sussex apple-tree at seven and been afraid of a ghost in an English lane." ...|$|E
6000|$|Before the {{suffering}}s of others I am always utterly powerless, and your letter reveals such depths of suffering that I hardly {{know what to say}} to you. This indeed is not my last word--but it must be my first. You are not isolated, verily, in such states of feeling as this--that is, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> appear to make all the misery of all mankind your own; only I have a terrible sense that you give all and receive nothing--that there is no reciprocity in your sympathy--that you have all the affliction of it and none of the returns. However--I am determined not to speak to you except with the voice of stoicism. I don't know why we live--the gift of life comes to us from I don't know what source or for what purpose; but I believe we can go on living for the reason that (always of course up to a certain point) life is the most valuable thing we know anything about, and it is therefore presumptively a great mistake to surrender it while there is any yet left in the cup. In other words consciousness is an illimitable power, and though at times it may seem to be all consciousness of misery, yet in the way it propagates itself from wave to wave, so that we never cease to feel, and though at moments we appear to, try to, pray to, there is something that holds one in one's place, makes it a standpoint in the universe which it is probably good not to forsake. You are right in your consciousness that we are all echoes and reverberations of the same, and you are noble when your interest and pity as to everything that surrounds you, appears to have a sustaining and harmonizing power. Only don't, I beseech you, generalize too much in these sympathies and tendernesses--remember that every life is a special problem which is not yours but another's, and content yourself with the terrible algebra of your own. Don't melt too much into the universe, but be as solid and dense and fixed as you can. We all live together, and those of us who love and know, live so most. We help each other--even unconsciously, each in our own effort, we lighten the effort of others, we contribute to the sum of success, make it possible for others to live. Sorrow comes in great waves--no one can know that better than you--but it rolls over us, and though it may almost smother us it leaves us on the spot, and we know that if it is strong we are stronger, inasmuch as it passes and we remain. It wears us, uses us, but we wear it and use it in return; and it is blind, whereas we after a manner see. My dear Grace, you are passing through a darkness in which I myself in my ignorance see nothing but that you have been made wretchedly ill by it; but it is only a darkness, it is not an end, or the end. Don't think, don't feel, any more than you can help, don't conclude or decide--don't do anything but wait. Everything will pass, and serenity and accepted mysteries and disillusionments, and the tenderness of a few good people, and new opportunities and ever so much of life, in a word, will remain. You will do all sorts of things yet, and I will help you. The only thing is not to melt in the meanwhile. I insist upon the necessity of a sort of mechanical condensation--so that however fast the horse may run away there will, when he pulls up, be a somewhat agitated but perfectly identical G. N. left in the saddle. Try not to be ill--that is all; for in that there is a failure. You are marked out for success, and you must not fail. You have my tenderest affection and all my confidence. Ever your faithful friend-- ...|$|E
