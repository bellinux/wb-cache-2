5|$|Multiple {{agencies}} predicted above-average activity, citing forecasts for slower-than-average trade winds, warmer-than-normal {{sea surface}} temperatures, abnormally low wind shear, and the unlikelihood of an El Niño developing {{prior to the}} peak of the season. On December5, 2012, Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), a public consortium consisting of experts on insurance, risk management, and seasonal climate forecasting at University College London, issued an extended-range forecast. In its report, the organization called for 15.4 (±4.3) named storms, 7.7 (±2.9) hurricanes, 3.4 (±1.6) major hurricanes, and a cumulative Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index of 134. While no value was placed on the number of expected landfalls during the season, TSR stated that the landfalling ACE <b>index</b> <b>was</b> expected to be above average. Four months later, on April5, Tropical Storm Risk issued its updated forecast, continuing to call for an above-average season with 15.2 (±4.1) named storms, 7.5 (±2.8) hurricanes, 3.4 (±1.6) major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 131; the landfalling ACE <b>index</b> <b>was</b> once again forecast to be higher than normal.|$|E

5|$|Although The Marble <b>Index</b> <b>was</b> largely unnoticed {{when it was}} released, it has {{achieved}} acclaim from music critics over time. Nico's unprecedented sound and personal style—both recognised for their tenebrous quality—are considered an influence on several artists. Most notably, they served as a musical and visual prototype for the 1980s post-punk movement's gothic rock scene. Nico and Cale continued working together, releasing two more studio albums in the same vein—Desertshore (1970) and The End... (1974)—which are now considered parts of a trilogy.|$|E
5|$|On June1, CSU {{released}} an updated forecast, {{increasing the number}} of predicted named storms to 8, due to the early formation of Tropical Storm Ana, while keeping the predictions for hurricanes and major hurricanes at 3 and 1, respectively; the ACE index forecast was also kept at 40 units. Probabilities of a major hurricane making landfall on various coastal areas remained below average. On August5, TSR updated their forecast and lowered the number of hurricanes developing within the basin to 4, with only 1 forecasted to be a major hurricane.

The Bird Community <b>Index</b> <b>was</b> high in one area near the source of Nescopeck Creek. In all other areas of the watershed, the <b>index</b> <b>was</b> low to medium. One of the lowest values is near Nescopeck Creek's mouth. The Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (HBI) has been measured for a number of sites along Nescopeck Creek and its tributaries. Upstream of the Jeddo Tunnel, Little Nescopeck Creek B has a high HBI. However, just downstream of the Jeddo Tunnel, the HBI drops off by a large amount. Black Creek has an HBI of 0 to 6.6, and this tributary's biodiversity is lower at its headwaters than at its confluence with Nescopeck Creek. Nescopeck Creek's HBI is from 1.7 to 5.4, depending on the site. In Nescopeck Creek, the total number of macroinvertebrate taxa at several sites ranges from 5 to 26. In Little Nescopeck Creek, the values range from 1 to 18. In Black Creek, the number ranges from 0 to 11.|$|E
5|$|There is the {{tradition}} of matrilineal inheritance in Kerala, where the mother {{is the head of}} the household. As a result, women in Kerala have had a much higher standing and influence in the society. This was common among certain influential castes and is a factor in the value placed on daughters. Christian missionaries also influenced Malayali women in that they started schools for girls from poor families. Opportunities for women such as education and gainful employment often translate into a lower birth rate, which in turn, make education and employment more likely to be accessible and more beneficial for women. This creates an upward spiral for both the women and children of the community that is passed on to future generations. According to the Human Development Report of 1996, Kerala's Gender Development <b>Index</b> <b>was</b> 597; higher than any other state of India. Factors, such as high rates of female literacy, education, work participation and life expectancy, along with favourable sex ratio, contributed to it.|$|E

40|$|Fixation indices {{summarize}} the associations between genes {{that arise from}} the joint effects of inbreeding and selection. In this paper, fixation <b>indices</b> <b>are</b> derived for pairs, triplets and quadruplets of genes at a single multiallelic locus. The fixation <b>indices</b> <b>are</b> obtained by dividing cumulants by constants; the cumulants describe the statistical distribution of alleles and the constants are functions of gene frequency. The use of cumulants instead of moments is necessary only for four-gene indices, when the fourth cumulant is used. A second type of four-gene <b>index</b> <b>is</b> also required, and this <b>index</b> <b>is</b> based upon the covariation of second-order cumulants. At multiallelic loci, {{a large number of}} <b>indices</b> <b>is</b> possible. If alleles are selectively neutral, the number of <b>indices</b> <b>is</b> reduced and the relationship between gene identity and gene cumulants <b>is</b> shown. —Two-gene <b>indices</b> can always <b>be</b> estimated from genotypic frequency data at a single polymorphic locus. Three-gene <b>indices</b> <b>are</b> also estimable except when allele frequency equals one-half. Four-gene <b>indices</b> <b>are</b> not estimable unless selection is assumed to have an equal effect upon each allele (such as under selective neutrality) and the locus contains at least three alleles of unequal frequency. For diallelic or selected loci, an alternative four-gene fixation <b>index</b> <b>is</b> proposed. This <b>index</b> incorporates both types of four-gene associations but cannot be related to gene identity...|$|R
