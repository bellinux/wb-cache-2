5|$|Induced {{defenses}} include secondary metabolic products, {{as well as}} morphological {{and physiological}} changes. An advantage of <b>inducible,</b> as opposed to constitutive defenses, {{is that they are}} only produced when needed, and are therefore potentially less costly, especially when herbivory is variable.|$|E
5|$|Owing to its {{predictable}} {{organization and}} readily <b>inducible</b> LTP, the CA1 hippocampus {{has become the}} prototypical site of mammalian LTP study. In particular, NMDA receptor-dependent LTP in the adult CA1 hippocampus is the most widely studied type of LTP, and is therefore {{the focus of this}} article.|$|E
5|$|Several enzymes {{can work}} {{together}} in a specific order, creating metabolic pathways. In a metabolic pathway, one enzyme takes the product of another enzyme as a substrate. After the catalytic reaction, the product is then passed on to another enzyme. Sometimes more than one enzyme can catalyze the same reaction in parallel; this can allow more complex regulation: with, for example, a low constant activity provided by one enzyme but an <b>inducible</b> high activity from a second enzyme.|$|E
5|$|Cyanogenic glycosides {{are stored}} in {{inactive}} forms in plant vacuoles. They become toxic when herbivores eat the plant and break cell membranes allowing the glycosides to {{come into contact with}} enzymes in the cytoplasm releasing hydrogen cyanide which blocks cellular respiration. Glucosinolates are activated {{in much the same way}} as cyanogenic glucosides, and the products can cause gastroenteritis, salivation, diarrhea, and irritation of the mouth. Benzoxazinoids, secondary defence metabolites, which are characteristic for grasses (Poaceae), are also stored as inactive glucosides in the plant vacuole. Upon tissue disruption they get into contact with β-glucosidases from the chloroplasts, which enzymatically release the toxic aglucones. Whereas some benzoxazinoids are constitutively present, others are only synthesised following herbivore infestation, and thus, considered <b>inducible</b> plant defenses against herbivory.|$|E
5|$|Depending on the {{organism}} and experimental system, the exogenous RNA {{may be a}} long strand designed to be cleaved by dicer, or short RNAs designed to serve as siRNA substrates. In most mammalian cells, shorter RNAs are used because long double-stranded RNA molecules induce the mammalian interferon response, a form of innate immunity that reacts nonspecifically to foreign genetic material. Mouse oocytes and cells from early mouse embryos lack this reaction to exogenous dsRNA {{and are therefore a}} common model system for studying mammalian gene-knockdown effects. Specialized laboratory techniques have also been developed to improve the utility of RNAi in mammalian systems by avoiding the direct introduction of siRNA, for example, by stable transfection with a plasmid encoding the appropriate sequence from which siRNAs can be transcribed, or by more elaborate lentiviral vector systems allowing the <b>inducible</b> activation or deactivation of transcription, known as conditional RNAi.|$|E
25|$|Minocycline is {{also known}} to {{indirectly}} inhibit <b>inducible</b> nitric oxide synthase (NOS).|$|E
25|$|In {{negative}} <b>inducible</b> operons, {{a regulatory}} repressor protein is normally {{bound to the}} operator, which prevents the transcription of the genes on the operon. If an inducer molecule is present, it binds to the repressor and changes its conformation {{so that it is}} unable to bind to the operator. This allows for expression of the operon. The lac operon is a negatively controlled <b>inducible</b> operon, where the inducer molecule is allolactose.|$|E
25|$|An <b>inducible</b> gene is a gene whose {{expression}} is either responsive to environmental change or {{dependent on the}} position in the cell cycle.|$|E
25|$|In {{positive}} <b>inducible</b> operons, activator proteins {{are normally}} unable to bind to the pertinent DNA. When an inducer is {{bound by the}} activator protein, it undergoes a change in conformation {{so that it can}} bind to the DNA and activate transcription.|$|E
25|$|Many of the prostanoids are know {{to mediate}} local {{symptoms}} of inflammation: vasoconstriction or vasodilation, coagulation, pain, and fever. Inhibition of COX-1 and/or the <b>inducible</b> COX-2 isoforms, is {{the hallmark of}} NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), such as aspirin. Prostanoids also activate the PPARγ members of the steroid/thyroid family of nuclear hormone receptors, and directly influence gene transcription.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{hematocrit}} is {{the number}} of red blood cells (RBC) in circulation and is highly variable among fish species. Active fish, like the blue marlin, tend to have higher hematocrits, whereas less active fish, such as the starry flounder exhibit lower hematocrits. Hematocrit may be increased in response to both short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic) hypoxia exposure and results in an increase in the total amount of oxygen the blood can carry, also known as the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. Acute changes in hematocrit are the result of circulating stress hormones (see - catecholamines) activating receptors on the spleen that cause the release of RBCs into circulation. During chronic hypoxia exposure, the mechanism used to increase hematocrit is independent of the spleen and results from hormonal stimulation of the kidney by erythropoetin (EPO). Increasing hematocrit in response to erythropoietin is observed after approximately one week and is therefore likely under genetic control of hypoxia <b>inducible</b> factor hypoxia <b>inducible</b> factor (HIF).|$|E
25|$|The lac operon of {{the model}} {{bacterium}} Escherichia coli was the first operon to be discovered and provides a typical example of operon function. It consists of three adjacent structural genes, a promoter, a terminator, and an operator. The lac operon is regulated by several factors including the availability of glucose and lactose. It can be activated by allolactose. Lactose binds to the repressor protein and prevents it from repressing gene transcription. This {{is an example of}} the derepressible (from above: negative <b>inducible)</b> model.|$|E
25|$|Doxycycline {{and other}} members of the {{tetracycline}} class of antibiotics are often used as research reagents in in vitro and in vivo biomedical research experiments involving bacteria as well in experiments in eukaryotic cells and organisms with <b>inducible</b> protein expression systems using tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activation. The mechanism of action for the antibacterial effect of tetracyclines relies on disrupting protein translation in bacteria, thereby damaging the ability of microbes to grow and repair; however protein translation is also disrupted in eukaryotic mitochondria impairing metabolism and leading to effects that can confound experimental results.|$|E
25|$|EMT's {{important}} {{feature is the}} loss of membrane E-cadherin in adherens junctions, where β-catenin may play a significant role. Translocation of β-catenin from adherens junctions to the nucleus may lead to a loss of E-cadherin and subsequently to EMT. Nuclear β-catenin apparently can directly, transcriptionally activate EMT-associated target genes, such as the E-cadherin gene repressor SLUG (also known as SNAI2). Mechanical properties of the tumor microenvironment, such as hypoxia, can contribute to CSC survival and metastatic potential through stabilization of hypoxia <b>inducible</b> factors through interactions with ROS (reactive oxygen species).|$|E
25|$|The <b>inducible</b> pathway (iNOS) of {{nitrogen}} oxide synthesis in phagocytes can generate {{large amounts of}} ·NO that trigger apoptosis in and thereby the death of cells. In vitro studies indicate that phagocyte-dependent generation of ·NO at concentrations greater than 400-500 NM triggers apoptosis in nearby cells and that this effect may act {{in a manner similar}} to Specialized pro-resolving mediators to dampen and reverse inflammatory responses by neutralizing and then speeding the clearance of pro-inflammatory cells from inflamed tissues. However, the role of ·NO in inflammation is complex with model studies involving viral infection suggesting that this gaseous mediator can also promote inflammation.|$|E
25|$|Synthesis of {{arginine}} from citrulline also {{occurs at}} a low level in many other cells, and cellular capacity for arginine synthesis can be markedly increased under circumstances that increase the production of <b>inducible</b> NOS (iNOS). This allows citrulline, a byproduct of the NOS-catalyzed production of nitric oxide, to be recycled to arginine in a pathway known as the citrulline-NO or arginine-citrulline pathway. This is demonstrated by the fact that, in many cell types, NO synthesis can be supported to some extent by citrulline, and not just by by arginine. This recycling is not quantitative, however, because citrulline accumulates in NO-producing cells along with nitrate and nitrite, the stable end-products of NO breakdown.|$|E
25|$|Patients with GEFS+ type 3 have {{mutations}} in the GABRG2 gene, which encodes the GABAA γ2 subunit (figure 2). The first mutation discovered in GABRG2 was K289M, in the extracellular region linking membrane-spanning domains M2 and M3. Oocytes injected with α1, β2, and γ2 subunits produce large GABA <b>inducible</b> currents whereas those injected with K289M mutant instead of wild-type subunits produce currents much smaller (about 10% of wild-type). This abnormal current {{is not the}} result of non-incorporation of mutant subunits since mutant containing receptors are still sensitive to benzodiazepines, a property for which functional γ subunits are required. Because of these results, it is believed that the GEFS+ phenotype in these individuals is a result of hyperexcitability.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that AM fungi release an unidentified diffusional factor, known as the myc factor, which activates the nodulation factor's <b>inducible</b> gene MtEnod11. This is the same gene involved in establishing symbiosis with the nitrogen fixing, rhizobial bacteria (Kosuta et al. 2003). When rhizobium bacteria are present in the soil, mycorrhizal colonization is increased due to an increase in the concentration of chemical signals involved in the establishment of symbiosis (Xie et al. 2003). Molecules similar to Nod factors were isolated from AM fungi and were shown to induce MtEnod11, lateral root formation and enhance mycorrhization. Effective mycorrhizal colonization can also increase the nodulations and symbiotic nitrogen fixation in mycorrhizal legumes.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to continuing descriptive {{studies of the}} effects of infection by defense mutualist endophytes, there has been a sharp {{increase in the number of}} studies which delve further into the ecology of plant-fungus associations and especially their multi-trophic impacts. The processes by which endophytic fungi alter plant physiology and volatile chemical levels are virtually unknown, and limited current results show a lack of consistency under differing environmental conditions, especially differing levels of herbivory. Studies comparing the relative impacts of mutualistic endophytes on <b>inducible</b> defenses and tolerance show a central function of infection in determining both responses to herbivore damage. On the whole, molecular mechanisms behind endophyte-mediated plant defense has been an increasing focus of research over the past ten years.|$|E
25|$|Nitric oxide is also {{generated}} by phagocytes (monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils) {{as part of}} the human immune response. Phagocytes are armed with <b>inducible</b> nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which is activated by interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) as a single signal or by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) along with a second signal. On the other hand, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) provides a strong inhibitory signal to iNOS, whereas interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-10 provide weak inhibitory signals. In this way, the immune system may regulate the armamentarium of phagocytes that play a role in inflammation and immune responses. Nitric oxide is secreted as free radicals in an immune response and is toxic to bacteria and intracellular parasites, including Leishmania and malaria; the mechanism for this includes DNA damage and degradation of iron sulfur centers into iron ions and iron-nitrosyl compounds.|$|E
25|$|Following λ-red operon {{activity}} induction, a linear, double-stranded cassette encoding a selectable marker, such as antibiotic resistance, {{is transformed}} into the cells {{in place of the}} target gene and incorporated into the DNA behind a specific <b>inducible</b> promoter. This allows for growth selection of the recombinant cells with proper insertion location verified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Specific incorporation can be achieved by including flanking PCR primers around the inserted linear DNA that are complement to the targeted insertion site. After selection of the recombinants, a second transformation is needed to remove the selective marker. A plasmid expressing flippase (FLP) can be transformed into the recombined cells, which can specifically cleave FLP recognition target sites (FRTs) flanking the antibiotic resistance gene. While this successfully removes the selective marker from the genome, it leaves FRT scars in place of the target gene.|$|E
25|$|Some {{chemical}} defenses {{once thought}} to be produced by the plant have since been shown to be synthesized by endophytic fungi. The chemical basis of insect resistance in endophyte-plant defense mutualisms has been most extensively studied in the perennial ryegrass and three major classes of secondary metabolites are found: indole diterpenes, ergot alkaloids and peramine. Related compounds are found across the range of endophytic fungal associations with plants. The terpenes and alkaloids are <b>inducible</b> defenses which act similarly to defensive compounds produced by plants and are highly toxic {{to a wide variety of}} phytophagous insects as well as mammalian herbivores. Peramine occurs widely in endophyte-associated grasses and may also act as a signal to invertebrate herbivores of the presence of more dangerous defensive chemicals. Terpenoids and ketones have been linked to protection from specialist and generalist herbivores (both insect and vertebrate) across the higher plants.|$|E

500|$|When {{testing a}} Gram-positive culture for {{sensitivity}} to clindamycin, {{it is common}} to perform a [...] "D-Test" [...] to determine if there is a macrolide-resistant subpopulation of bacteria present. This test is necessary because some bacteria express a phenotype known as MLSB, in which susceptibility tests will indicate the bacteria are susceptible to clindamycin, but in vitro the pathogen displays <b>inducible</b> resistance.|$|E
500|$|The most {{important}} symptoms for diagnosing serotonin syndrome are tremor, extreme aggressiveness, akathisia, or clonus (spontaneous, <b>inducible</b> and ocular). Physical {{examination of the}} patient should include assessment of deep-tendon reflexes and muscle rigidity, [...] the dryness of the mucosa of the mouth, the size and reactivity of the pupils, the intensity of bowel sounds, skin color, and {{the presence or absence}} of sweating. The patient's history also plays an important role in diagnosis, investigations should include inquiries about the use of prescription and over-the-counter drugs, illicit substances, and dietary supplements, as all these agents have been implicated in the development of serotonin syndrome. To fulfill the Hunter Criteria, a patient must have taken a serotonergic agent and meet one of the following conditions: ...|$|E
500|$|By {{studying}} {{the ratio of}} 14C to 13C incorporated into a plant—its isotopic signature—it is possible to deduce how much [...] is taken up at night and how much in the daytime. Using this approach, most of the Pereskia species investigated exhibit some degree of CAM-cycling, suggesting this ability was present in the ancestor of all cacti. Pereskia leaves are claimed to only have the [...] C3 mechanism with CAM restricted to stems. More recent studies show that [...] "it {{is highly unlikely that}} significant carbon assimilation occurs in the stem"; Pereskia species are described as having [...] "C3 with <b>inducible</b> CAM." [...] Leafless cacti carry out all their photosynthesis in the stem, using full CAM. , {{it is not clear whether}} stem-based CAM evolved once only in the core cacti, or separately in the opuntias and cactoids; CAM is known to have evolved convergently many times.|$|E
500|$|... a {{significant}} decrease of the larvae damage, indicating that {{a high level of}} constitutive protection is superior to an <b>inducible</b> defence mechanism. However, the continuous activation of prosystemin is costly, affecting the growth, the physiology and the reproductive success of tomato plants. [...] When systemin was silenced, production of protease inhibitors in tomato was severely impaired and larvae feeding on the plants grew three times as fast. HypSys caused similar changes in gene expression in tobacco, for example polyphenol oxidase activity increased tenfold in tobacco leaves and protease inhibitors caused a 30% decrease in chymotrypsin activity within three days of wounding. When HypSys was over-expressed in tobacco, larvae feeding on transgenic plants weighed half as much after ten days feeding, as those feeding on normal plants. The concentration of hydrogen peroxide increased in the vasculature tissues when the production of systemin, HypSys or AtPep1 is induced, this may also be involved in initiating systemic acquired resistance.|$|E

2500|$|Bacterial {{electron}} transport pathways are, in general, <b>inducible.</b> [...] Depending {{on their}} environment, bacteria can synthesize different transmembrane complexes and produce different electron transport chains in their cell membranes. [...] Bacteria select their electron transport chains from a DNA library containing multiple possible dehydrogenases, terminal oxidases and terminal reductases. [...] The situation is often summarized {{by saying that}} electron transport chains in bacteria are branched, modular, and <b>inducible.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Promoter - {{commonly}} used <b>inducible</b> promoters are promoters derived from lac operon and the T7 promoter. Other strong promoters used include Trp promoter and Tac-Promoter, {{which are a}} hybrid of both the Trp and Lac Operon promoters.|$|E
2500|$|Viral {{promoters}} {{are often}} used for constitutive expression in plasmids and in viral vectors because they normally force constant transcription in many cell lines and types reliably. <b>Inducible</b> expression depends on promoters that respond to the induction conditions: for example, the murine mammary tumor virus promoter only initiates transcription after dexamethasone application and the Drosophilia heat shock promoter only initiates after high temperatures.|$|E
