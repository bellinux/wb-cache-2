25|$|There {{appear to}} be no records of eye {{movement}} research until the early 19th century. At first, the chief concern was to describe the eye as a physiological and mechanical moving object, the most serious attempt being Hermann von Helmholtz's major work Handbook of physiological optics (1866). The physiological approach was gradually superseded by interest in the psychological aspects of visual input, in eye movement as a <b>functional</b> <b>component</b> of visual tasks.

The task force became part of USSTRATCOM in October 2002; it was renamed Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations (JTF-GNO) in 2004.

40|$|A {{distributed}} system {{is viewed as}} a collection of <b>functional</b> <b>components</b> and a unifying structure that defines relationships among the components. In this paper, we advocate a particular approach to {{distributed system}} specification and design in which the structure of a distributed system is specified separately from the <b>functional</b> <b>components.</b> This permits one to reason about individual <b>functional</b> <b>components</b> in isolation, and encourages one to make explicit not only the input/output behavior of the <b>functional</b> <b>components</b> but also the logical placement of these components within the overall structure of the system. We describe a new software tool for the specification, design, and simulation of distributed systems that supports this separation of structure and function.

25|$|DIA {{is not a}} {{collective}} of all U.S. military intelligence units and the work it performs is not in lieu of that falling under intelligence components of individual services. Unlike the Russian GRU, which encompasses equivalents of nearly all joint U.S. military intelligence operations, DIA assists and coordinates the activities of individual service-level intelligence units (i.e. 25 AF, INSCOM, etc.), but they nevertheless remain separate entities. As a general rule, DIA handles national-level, long term and strategic intelligence needs, whereas service-level intelligence components handle tactical, short-term goals pertinent to their respective services. DIA does, however, lead coordination efforts with the military intelligence units and with the national DOD intelligence services (NSA, NGA, NRO) in its role {{as chair of the}} Military Intelligence Board and through the co-located Joint <b>Functional</b> <b>Component</b> Command for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.|$|E
500|$|The Kakapo Recovery {{programme}} {{has been}} successful, {{with the numbers}} of kakapo increasing steadily.

To help meet this conservation challenge, two large Fiordland islands, Resolution (20,860ha) and Secretary (8,140ha), have been prepared for re-introduction of the kakapo with large-scale ecological restoration activities. Ultimately, the Kakapo Recovery vision for the species is to restore the [...] "mauri" [...] (Maori for [...] "life-force") of the kakapo by breeding 150 adult females.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Software {{construction}} with reusable {{components and}} legacy code has proven useful for fast and low-cost software development in many real world applications. However, since this methodology is often applied to domains with stringent performance and resource constraints such as embedded systems, its ignorance of non-functional constraints {{makes it very}} difficult and expensive to meet the constraints at a post-integration stage. In this paper, we propose a new methodology for (i) integrating a performance model with functional models during the design phase, and (ii) using the performance model parameters along with <b>functional</b> <b>components</b> throughout all SW development phases that usually rely on different tools. The performance model is constructed by examining the performance requirements and characteristics of <b>functional</b> <b>components</b> and their interaction patterns, and by associating them with <b>functional</b> <b>components</b> and patterns as performance parameters. The advantage of such modeling lies in that the performance model is easily integratable with <b>functional</b> <b>components</b> and can be reused just like reusable <b>functional</b> <b>components.</b> The proposed performance modeling, therefore, solves the cross-cutting issues of performanceaware functional design, and makes the consistent performance information available across the different phases of software lifecycle. The main technical issues for such performance modeling include how to partition the performance model along the function models and software architecture, how to determine and systematically measure the performance parameters of software components in each partition for reuse in constructing different performance models, and representing the performance parameters for use across different tools, and building a performance model for designtime analysis and runtime QoS management. ...|$|R
