25|$|A cell-first {{cross-section}} uses some <b>hyperplane</b> {{parallel to}} one of the octahedral cells of a 24-cell. Consider, for instance, some <b>hyperplane</b> orthogonal to the vector (1,1,0,0). The cross-section of {3,4,3,3} by this <b>hyperplane</b> is a rectified cubic honeycomb. Each cuboctahedron in this honeycomb is a maximal cross-section of a 24-cell whose center lies in the plane. Meanwhile, each octahedron is a boundary cell of a (4-dimensional) 24-cell whose center lies off the plane. Shifting this <b>hyperplane</b> till it lies halfway between the center of a 24-cell and the boundary, one obtains a bitruncated cubic honeycomb. The cuboctahedra have shrunk, and the octahedra have grown until they are both truncated octahedra. Shifting again, so the <b>hyperplane</b> intersects the boundary of the central 24-cell gives a rectified cubic honeycomb again, the cuboctahedra and octahedra having swapped positions. As the <b>hyperplane</b> sweeps through 4-space, the cross-section morphs between these two honeycombs periodically.|$|E

25|$|A vertex-first {{cross-section}} uses some <b>hyperplane</b> {{orthogonal to}} a line joining opposite vertices {{of one of the}} 24-cells. For instance, one could take any of the coordinate hyperplanes in the coordinate system given above (i.e. the planes determined by x'i = 0). The cross-section of {3,4,3,3} by one of these hyperplanes gives a rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb. Each of the rhombic dodecahedra corresponds to a maximal cross-section of one of the 24-cells intersecting the <b>hyperplane</b> (the center of each such (4-dimensional) 24-cell lies in the <b>hyperplane).</b> Accordingly, the rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb is the Voronoi tessellation of the D3 root lattice (a face-centered cubic lattice). Shifting this <b>hyperplane</b> halfway to one of the vertices (e.g. x'i = ½) gives rise to a regular cubic honeycomb. In this case the center of each 24-cell lies off the <b>hyperplane.</b> Shifting again, so the <b>hyperplane</b> intersects the vertex, gives another rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb but with new 24-cells (the former ones having shrunk to points). In general, for any integer n, the cross-section through x'i = n is a rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb, and the cross-section through x'i = n + ½ is a cubic honeycomb. As the <b>hyperplane</b> moves through 4-space, the cross-section morphs between the two periodically.|$|E

We are motivated by the work of Viola and Jones [10] who used Haar-like wavelet features as their weak classifiers in the AdaBoost learning algorithm. These weak classifiers were chosen for their speed. We explore how much may be gained by using more powerful but less computationally efficient weak classifiers.

In addition to being of theoretical interest, this question has practical importance for hardware implementations of a face detector in which dot products may be very fast to compute. The difficulty with using thresholded <b>hyperplanes</b> as weak classifiers is that the brute force search over all possible <b>hyperplanes</b> which was used in Viola-Jones is no longer practical.
