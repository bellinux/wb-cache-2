5|$|The {{events in}} Arkham Origins take place {{about five years}} before , in midwinter Gotham City. Batman, an {{experienced}} crime-fighter {{in the second year}} of his career, is not yet the veteran superhero of Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. He is a mysterious force; even the police do not <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> is a vigilante, a myth or a supernatural being. Batman has fought ordinary criminals and gangsters, and is accustomed to being stronger and faster than his opponents. However, on a snowy Christmas Eve he is confronted with more-dangerous foes: eight professional assassins hoping to collect a $50-million bounty placed on Batman's head by Black Mask. Villains (including the Joker) take advantage of the assassins' arrival to launch their own schemes, and Black Mask's henchmen instigate a rise in crime and gang activity in the city.|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} {{were aware}} that Matthew Macfadyen would leave the series after playing Tom Quinn for two years, {{and they did not}} <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> would return for the first two episodes. An eight- to nine-member team came up with the new character of Adam Carter. They wanted Adam to have a different dynamic than Tom; the producers set up a girlfriend/boyfriend storyline in the first series [...] with Adam, they wanted him to have a wife (Fiona Carter) who works in the Security Service, since married couples working in that environment are common. They wanted Adam to be more animated and energetic than Tom. Writer Howard Brenton wanted him to have an MI6 background, and have something awful happen to him in the past. Brenton invented the backstory of Syria early on into the third series, which he wanted to revisit in the fourth series.|$|E

NBA commissioner David Stern also believed Lin was not drafted due to discrimination. [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> was discriminated against because he was at Harvard. Or because he was Asian," [...] said Stern. Some fans and commentators wrote off his Warriors signing as a publicity stunt. Larry Riley, the team's general manager, denied catering to the Bay Area's large Asian population. He understood that some people would see it that way. [...] "We evaluated him throughout summer league," [...] Riley said. [...] "All that had to happen was for him to confirm what we already believed."

Or did he not give the work a number at all, because he was not satisfied with it?" [...] The composer's daughter Katarina spoke of the self-doubt that afflicted her father at this time, aggravated by the continuing expectations and fuss that surrounded the Eighth Symphony.

500|$|Tchaikovsky began {{showing a}} keen {{interest}} in Glazunov shortly after hearing about the premiere of Glazunov's First Symphony from Taneyev. At that time, Tchaikovsky wrote Balakirev, [...] "Glazunov interests me greatly. Is there any chance that this young man could send me the symphony so that I might take a look at it? I should also like to <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> completed it, either conceptually or practically, with your or Rimsky-Korsakov's help." [...] Balakirev replied, [...] "You ask about Glazunov. He is a very talented young man who studied for a year under Rimsky-Korsakov. When he composed his symphony, he did not need any help." [...] Tchaikovsky studied the score for Glazunov's First String Quartet, and wrote his brother Modest, [...] "Despite its imitation of Korsakov ... a remarkable talent is discernible."

500|$|Following the {{acceptance}} of the Petition by the House of Lords, Charles sent a message to the Commons [...] "forbidding them to meddle with affairs of state", something that produced a furious debate. John Finch, the Speaker of the House of Commons, announced that he had been commanded to interrupt any Member of Parliament who should insult or cast aspersion on a Minister of State, such as the Duke of Buckingham. This produced a [...] "spectacle of passions" [...] in the House; the tradition of free speech within the Commons was a long one, and many MPs found themselves [...] "unable to speak for tears running down their faces at the thought of the destruction of the liberties of Parliament". Coke, although crying, declared that he did not <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> would be allowed to speak in Parliament again, but named Buckingham anyway, saying that [...] "the Duke of Buckingham is the cause of all our miseries, and till the King be informed thereof we shall never go out with honour, or sit with honour here; that man is the grievance of grievances; let us set down the cause of all our disasters and they will reflect upon him".|$|E
500|$|Book Eight, War of the Asuras, {{is set in}} the 20th century, {{during the}} [...] "Long War". The world has become divided into three large alliances, the Chinese Empire and its colonies, the {{fractured}} Muslim world (Dar al-Islam), and the democratic Indian and Hodenosaunee Leagues. At the outbreak of war the Muslim states put aside their differences and unite to flight the larger threat of China (whom they fear will soon achieve global hegemony). The Indian and Hodenosaunee Leagues stay neutral at first, but eventually ally with China, as they see the Muslims as their greater enemy, however the Muslims invade northern India {{all the way down to}} Burma to stop the Indians and Chinese from linking up. The war drags on for decades causing major changes in the societies involved, with rapid industrialisation, mass conscription and mass casualties (both sides are forced to use women in the fighting to make up for manpower losses). Being the first industrial war, new devastating weapons and methods are employed, such as trench warfare, poison gas and aerial bombing. The story follows Chinese officers, Kuo, Bai and Iwa as they desperately fight in the trenches of the Gansu Corridor, where the ground has been blasted down to bedrock by sixty years of bombardments (the latest massive artillery pieces lob shells into space on ballistic trajectories). The new Chinese government, the [...] "Fourth Assemblage of Military Talent" [...] (the Qing Dynasty having been overthrown by a military coup during the war) orders a new offensive against the Muslim lines in Gansu. Kuo, Bai and Iwa are told to use poison gas and then frontally assault the enemy trenches. They do this successfully, but are then beaten back by the second line of Muslim defences, losing tens of thousands of soldiers and gaining nothing. However they are then told that their attack was merely a diversion for the real offensive which is being conducted by the Japanese (who have recently been freed by China in exchange for alliance in the war) through Siberia. The Muslims are in retreat but the Japanese get bogged down at the Ural Mountains. In the meantime, Kuo is killed by a shell which penetrates their bunker, Bai and Iwa are then ordered to move with their company south through Tibet to support their Indian allies. At a pass in the Himalayas they witness the Muslim artillery blasting the top of Mount Everest down so that the tallest mountain in the world will be in Muslim lands. After extreme difficulties they manage to breach the Muslim defences at the pass and the Chinese army pours through to meet up with the Indians, turning the course of the war in their favour. However Bai is plagued by visions of his dead friend Kuo, who tells him that none of this is happening and that he is already dead, killed by the shell earlier. Bai does not <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> is indeed living real life or is already in the afterlife.|$|E
