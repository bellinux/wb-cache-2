The authorities have synthesized a literary standard for Mongolian in whose grammar {{is said to be}} based on Southern Mongolian and whose pronunciation is based on the Chakhar dialect as spoken in the Plain Blue Banner. Dialectologically, however, western Southern Mongolian dialects are closer to Khalkha than they are to eastern Southern Mongolian dialects: for example, Chakhar is closer to Khalkha than to Khorchin.|$|E

5|$|In the balkline games, {{rather than}} drawing balklines {{a few inches}} from the corners, the entire table is divided into {{rectangular}} balk spaces, by drawing balklines a certain distance lengthwise and widthwise across the length of the table a set number of inches parallel out from each rail. This <b>divides</b> <b>the</b> table into eight rectangular balkspaces. Additionally, rectangles are drawn where each balkline meets a rail, called anchor spaces, which developed to stop a number of nursing techniques that exploited the fact that if the object balls straddled a balkline, no count limit was in place.|$|E
5|$|Lincolnshire is {{a village}} in Vernon Township, Lake County, in the U.S. state of Illinois. The village is a {{northern}} suburb of Chicago. The population of Lincolnshire was 7,275 at the 2010 census. Lincolnshire was incorporated on August 5, 1957, from the unincorporated Half Day area when land was purchased to build a residential subdivision. The community underwent an aggressive era of expansion from 1983 to the 1990s. The Des Plaines River bisects the village, passing from north to south; Illinois Route 22 also <b>divides</b> <b>the</b> village into two parts, crossing the village from east to west.|$|E

The Association of Surfing Professionals often pairs female surf meets with bikini contests, an issue that <b>divides</b> <b>the</b> female pro-surfing community into two parts. It has often been more profitable to win the bikini contest than the female surfing event.|$|E
