5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{has largely}} removed {{himself to the}} online virtual world of Second Life. Dwight <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>an</b> avatar named Dwight Shelford, also a paper salesman, {{patterned}} after his once-perfect real life. He now uses Second Life as an escape from his real-life troubles, even going as far as creating a virtual Second Life, called Second Second Life. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), on the other hand, <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>an</b> avatar named Jim Samtanko, a guitar-playing Philadelphia sportswriter, and enters Second Life in order to spy on Dwight.|$|E

5|$|Recent animal {{research}} coupling a murine {{monoclonal antibody}} with doxorubicin <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>an</b> immunoconjugate that {{was able to}} eliminate HIV-1 infection in mice. Current treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) still leaves pockets of HIV within the host. The immunoconjugate could potentially provide a complementary treatment to ART to eradicate antigen-expressing T cells.|$|E
50|$|The Internet <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> {{new channel}} for groups to spread their messages.

5|$|Due to {{successive}} remodelings and enlargements {{the architecture}} at Ashton Court {{is complex and}} seldom what it seems. The core of the house, a 15th-century manor, has been obliterated by later wings, which have in turn been remodelled and altered, most substantially around 1635. Therefore, the plan of the house has evolved as irregular with many juxtapositions and little cohesion; {{while the majority of}} the house was built in the 17th century, a time of classical architecture, remodelling and alteration to the fenestration <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>an</b> overall Gothic appearance.|$|E
5|$|IndiGo {{became one}} of the fastest growing low cost {{carriers}} in the world and was the largest profitable airline in India. The success of IndiGo has been attributed to its unique business model which reduces costs. The airline operates a single type of aircraft (Airbus A320) in similar seating configuration which simplifies crew training and maintenance. The airline strikes bulk deals with Airbus reducing unit costs. The airline targets a quick turn-around time of 20 minutes to get the aircraft ready for the next flight, ensuring planes fly about 12 hours every day. With this it <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>an</b> Indian record of more than 900 flights a day. Employees share multiple roles with a check-in staff doubling as a baggage handler.|$|E
5|$|Papa Stour {{is one of}} the Shetland Islands in Scotland, with a {{population}} of under twenty people, some of whom immigrated after an appeal for residents in the 1970s. Located to the west of mainland Shetland and with an area of 828hectares (3.2square miles), Papa Stour is the eighth largest island in Shetland. Erosion of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>an</b> extraordinary variety of caves, stacks, arches, blowholes, and cliffs. The island and its surrounding seas harbour diverse populations of wildlife. The west side of the island is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and the seas around the island are a Special Area of Conservation.|$|E

5|$|Academic Decathlon is {{designed}} to include students from all achievement levels. Teams generally consist of nine members, who are divided into three divisions based on grade point average: Honors (3.75–4.00 GPA), Scholastic (3.00–3.74 GPA), and Varsity (0.00–2.99 GPA). Each team member competes in all ten events against other students {{in his or her}} division, and team scores are calculated using the top two overall individual scores from each team in all three divisions. Gold, silver, and bronze medals are awarded for individual events and for overall scores. To earn a spot at the national competition in April, teams must advance through local, regional, and state competitions, though some levels of competition may be bypassed for smaller states. Online competitions, separated into small, medium, and large categories, are also offered.

25|$|Balochistan is a {{resource}} rich region of Pakistan with an active separatist movement {{that has caused}} conflict between Pakistan and the people living within the region. The Balochistan conflict <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>an</b> unstable environment for journalists as they receive pressure from both the Pakistani government and nationalist groups about the coverage given to the other side. Journalists are often the target of death threats.|$|E
25|$|The {{complexity}} of modern industrialized {{life with a}} greater 150 prominence of hazards <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>an</b> increase in the skills needed in firefighting technology and a broadening of the firefighter's remit. The fire service, also known in some countries as the fire brigade or fire department, {{is one of the}} three main emergency services. Firefighting and firefighters have become ubiquitous around the world, from wildlands to urban areas, and aboard ships.|$|E
