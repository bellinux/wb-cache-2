40|$|Involvement of {{transcriptional}} {{mechanisms in}} the inhibition of NOS 2 expression by dexamethasone in rat mesangial cells. In previous studies we reported that stimulation of rat mesangial cells (RMC) with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) + tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) (L/T) elicits inducible {{nitric oxide synthase}} (NOS 2) mRNA expression, which is inhibited by dexamethasone (DX). We have now analyzed the mechanisms responsible for this inhibitory effect. Dexamethasone had no destabilizing effect on NOS 2 mRNA. Transfection of RMC with several luciferase reporter constructs from the 5 ′ <b>flanking</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>region</b> of the rat NOS 2 gene established {{the importance of the}} NF-κB site in the transcriptional activation of the NOS 2 gene. DNA mobility shift assays showed activation by L/T of the NF-κB complex in a time-dependent manner. Dexamethasone specifically inhibited this activation in a process dependent on the glucocorticoid receptor and with a markedly greater effect when it was added prior to L/T. Dexamethasone increased the expression of the IκB-α transcript and protein in the cytoplasm. While treatment of RMC with L/T induced the transient decrement of cytoplasmic p 65 levels and its appearance in the nucleus, preincubation with DX prevented this effect. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemical studies demonstrated that IκB-α is associated with p 65 in the cytoplasm of RMC after treatment with DX and L/T. These results prove that inhibition of NF-κB-mediated transcription is a crucial mechanism by which DX inhibits NOS 2 expression, and that this occurs by increasing cytoplasmic IκB-α levels and sequestering the activating subunits of NF-κB in the cytoplasm. The need for previous induction of IκB-α could provide a molecular explanation for the limited efficacy of these agents in the therapy of septic shock...|$|E
40|$|Histamine H 1 {{receptor}} expression {{has been}} reported to change in disorders such as allergic rhinitis, autoimmune myocarditis, rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis. Here we report the isolation and characterization of genomic clones containing the 5 ' <b>flanking</b> (<b>regulatory)</b> <b>region</b> of the human histamine H 1 receptor gene. An intron of approx. 5. 8 kb was identified in the 5 ' untranslated region, which suggests that an entire subfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors may contain an intron immediately upstream of the start codon. The transcription initiation site was mapped by 5 ' rapid amplification of cDNA ends to a region 6. 2 kb upstream of the start codon. Immediately upstream of the transcription start site a fragment of 1. 85 kb was identified that showed promoter activity when placed upstream of a luciferase reporter gene and transiently transfected into cells expressing the histamine H 1 receptor. The promoter sequence shares a number of characteristics with the promoter sequences of other G-protein-coupled receptor encoding genes, including binding sites for several transcription factors, and the absence of TATA and CAAT sequences at the appropriate locations. The promoter sequence described here differs from that reported previously [Fukui, Fujimoto, Mizuguchi, Sakamoto, Horio, Takai, Yamada and Ito (1994) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 201, 894 - 901] because the reported genomic clone was chimaeric. Furthermore our study provides evidence that the 3 ' untranslated region of the H 1 receptor mRNA is much longer than previously accepted.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{phosphate}} carrier (PiC) is {{a nuclear}} encoded protein {{that belongs to}} the mitochondrial carrier protein family. Its physiological role is to catalyze the transport of inorganic phosphate into the mitochondrial matrix (1). Uptake of phosphate into mitochondria {{is essential for the}} oxidative phosphorylation of ADP to ATP. Only one human gene for the PiC, that give rises to two alternatively spliced isoforms (A and B), has been detected [...] The recombinant, reconstituted isoforms A and B exhibit similar substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity, but differ in their kinetic parameters and tissue distribution (2). We have analyzed the 5 ’-flanking region of the human PiC gene and have identified a single transcriptional initiation site, an activation domain and an inhibition domain (3). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Materilas and methods employed are reported in ref. 3. RESULTS: Through deletion analysis of the 5 ’ <b>flanking</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>region</b> (- 1213 /- 25 bp) and transient transfection of HeLa cells we have identified two distinct domains in the promoter of the PiC gene: an activation domain (- 223 /- 25) and a inhibition domain (- 1017 /- 814). The activation domain binds Sp 1 and CREB with high specificity, as demonstrated by EMSA competion experiments. The CREB element is important not only for basal expression, but also for induced expression through the cAMP/protein kinase pathway. In fact, upon stimulation with foskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, we observed a clear increase in the level of both PiC mRNA and PiC protein and a two-fold activation of CAT expression. The silencer region was also characterized [...] By Southwestern experiments two polypeptides (about 100 kDa and 55 KDa, respectively) were found to bind to a region of 25 nucleotides (from - 943 to - 919 bp). These two proteins were purified and identified as PSF (protein associated splicing factor) (100 KDa) and p 54 nrb/NonO (55 KDa) by mass spectrometry. These findings may provide insight into the control of PiC gene expression. 1. 	Palmieri, F. (2004) Pflugers Arch. 446, 689 - 709 2. 	Fiermonte, G., Dolce, V., and Palmieri, F. (1998) J. Biol.

40|$|The {{protein kinase}} GCN 2 stimulates {{translation}} of the transcriptional activator GCN 4 in yeast cells starved for amino acids by phosphorylating translation initiation factor 2. Several regulatory domains, including a pseudokinase domain, a histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HisRS) -related region, and a C-terminal (C-term) segment required for ribosome association, {{have been identified in}} GCN 2. We used the yeast two-hybrid assay, coimmunoprecipitation analysis, and in vitro binding assays to investigate physical interactions between the different functional domains of GCN 2. A segment containing about two thirds of the protein kinase (PK) catalytic domain and another containing the C-term region of GCN 2 interacted with themselves in the two-hybrid assay, and both the PK and the C-term domains could be coimmunoprecipitated with wild-type GCN 2 from yeast cell extracts. In addition, in vitro-translated PK and C-term segments showed specific binding in vitro to recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) –PK and GST–C-term fusion proteins, respectively. Wild-type GCN 2 could be coimmunoprecipitated with a full-length LexA-GCN 2 fusion protein from cell extracts, providing direct evidence for dimerization by full-length GCN 2 molecules. Deleting the C-term or PK segments abolished or reduced, respectively, the yield of GCN 2 –LexA-GCN 2 complexes. These results provide in vivo and in vitro evidence that GCN 2 dimerizes through self-interactions involving the C-term and PK domains. The PK domain showed pairwise in vitro binding interactions with the pseudokinase, HisRS, and C-term domains; additionally, the HisRS domain interacted with the C-term region. We propose that physical interactions between the PK domain and its <b>flanking</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>regions</b> and dimerization through the PK and C-term domains both play important roles in restricting GCN 2 kinase activity to amino acid-starved cells...|$|R
40|$|STAR (Signal Transduction and Activation of RNA) {{proteins}} owed {{their name}} to the presence in their structure ofa RNA-binding domain and several hallmarks of their involvement in signal transduction pathways. In {{many members of the}} family, the STAR RNA-binding domain (also named GSG, an acronym for GRP 33 /Sam 68 / GLD- 1) is <b>flanked</b> by <b>regulatory</b> <b>regions</b> containing proline-rich sequences, which serve as docking sites for proteins containing SH 3 and WW domains and also a tyrosine-rich region at the C-terminus, which can mediateprotein-protein interactions with partners through SH 2 domains. These <b>regulatory</b> <b>regions</b> contain consensus sequences for additional modifications, including serine/threonine phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation and sumoylation. Since their initial description, evidence has been gathered in different cell types and model organisms that STAR proteins can indeed integrate signals from external and internal cues with changes in transcription and processing of target RNAs. The most striking example of the high versatility of STAR proteins is provided by Sam 68 (KHDRBS 1), whose function, subcellular localization and affinity for RNA are strongly modulated by several signaling pathways through specific modifications. Moreover, the recent development of genetic knockout models has unveiled the physiological function of some STAR proteins, pointing to a crucial role of their post-translational modifications in the biological processes regulated by these RNA-binding proteins. This chapter offers an overview of the most updated literature on the regulation of STAR proteins by post-translational modifications and illustrates examples of how signal transduction pathways can modulate their activity and affect biological processes...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{phosphate}} carrier (PiC) {{belongs to}} the mitochondrial carrier protein family. Its physiological role is to catalyze the transport of inorganic phosphate into the mitochondria. Only one PiC gene in man and cow, that gives rise to two alternatively spliced isoforms (A and B), has been detected (1). The recombinant, reconstituted isoforms exhibit similar substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity but differ in their kinetic parameters and tissue distribution (2). Until now nothing was known about the transcriptional control of the PiC gene. We have analyzed the promoter of the human PiC gene and identified an activation domain and an inhibition domain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transient transfection of Hela cells, EMSA and DNA footprinting were performed as described in ref. 3. Silencer proteins were purified by affinity chromatography and identified by mass spectrometry as described (3). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Through deletion analysis of the 5 ’ <b>flanking</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>region</b> of the human PiC (- 1213 /- 25) and transient transfection we have identified two domains in the promoter of the human PiC gene: an activation domain (- 223 /- 25) and an inhibition domain (- 1017 /- 814). The most effective promoter activity in transfected HeLa cells corresponded to the region containing putative binding sites for Sp 1 (- 163 /- 142) and CREB (- 138 /- 116). These DNA sequences were active in gel shift assays {{in the presence of}} HeLa cell nuclear extracts or recombinant Sp 1 and CREB, respectively. The CREB element is important for basal expression and for induced expression through the cAMP/protein kinase pathway. In fact, upon stimulation with foskolin, we observed an increase in the level of both PiC mRNA and PiC protein. Both footprinting and transfection of deletion constructs of the inhibition region (- 1017 /- 814) showed that PiC silencer activity extends over 25 nts (- 943 /- 919), which specifically binds two proteins present in HeLa cell nuclear extracts. These transcription factors were purified by DNA affinity, analyzed by mass spectrometry and identified as p 54 nrb/NonO and PSF. These findings may provide insight into the control of PiC gene expression in different cell types and under different growth conditions. 1. 	Dolce V., et al. (1994) J. Biol.

We investigated whether the fenofibrateinduced increase in HDL-cholesterol {{is dependent on}} the expression of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP).

40|$|Mini-F is {{a segment}} of the conjugative plasmid F {{consisting}} of two origins of replication <b>flanked</b> by <b>regulatory</b> <b>regions,</b> which ensure a normal control of replication and partitioning. Adjacent to the ori- 2 origin is a complex coding region that consists of the E gene overlapped by three open reading frames with the coding potential for 9000 Mr polypeptides here designated 9 kd- 1, 9 kd- 2 and 9 kd- 3. In this paper, we show that open reading frame 9 kd- 3 is preceded by active promoter and Shine-Dalgarno sequences. The E coding region specifies: (1) an initiator of replication, which acts at the ori- 2 site; (2) a function that negatively regulates the expression of the E gene; and (3) a function involved in mini-F copy number control. To assign one of these functions to one of the overlapping coding sequences, we have isolated, characterized and sequenced mutations mapping in the E coding region. In this paper, we analyse two mutations (cop 5 and pla 25) that abolish the repression of the E gene. As these mutations affect the primary structure of protein E itself but not the 9 kd polypeptides, we conclude that protein E takes part in the negative regulation of its own synthesis. In addition, the localization of the cop 5 and pla 25 mutations indicates that the carboxy-terminal end of the E protein is involved in the autorepression function. The cop 5 mutation causes an eightfold increase of the mini-F copy number. The pla 25 mutation leads to the inability of the derived mini-F plasmid to give rise to plasmid-harbouring bacteria. The ways in which the cop 5 and pla 25 mutations may lead to such phenotypes are discussed in relation to the different functions mapping in the E coding sequence. © 1986.

40|$|Carotenoids are {{produced}} {{by a variety of}} organisms, but the mechanisms that regulate gene expression leading to carotenoid biosynthesis have been characterized for only a few organisms. In this study, we found that Streptomyces coelicolor A 3 (2), a gram-positive filamentous bacterium, produces carotenoids under blue light induction. The carotenoid fraction isolated from the cell extract contained multiple compounds, including isorenieratene and β-carotene. The carotenoid biosynthesis gene cluster of S. coelicolor consists of two convergent operons, crtEIBV and crtYTU, as previously shown for Streptomyces griseus. The crtEIBV null mutant completely lost its ability to produce carotenoids. The crt gene cluster is <b>flanked</b> by a <b>regulatory</b> <b>region</b> that consists of two divergent operons, litRQ and litSAB. The lit (light-induced transcription) genes encode a MerR-type transcriptional regulator (LitR), a possible oxidoreductase (LitQ), an extracytoplasmic function sigma factor (σLitS), a putative lipoprotein (LitA), and a putative anti-sigma factor (LitB). S 1 protection assay revealed that the promoters preceding crtE (PcrtE), crtY (PcrtY), litR (PlitR), and litS (PlitS) are activated upon illumination. A litS mutant lost both the ability to produce carotenoids and the activities of PcrtE, PcrtY, and PlitS, which suggested that σLitS directs light-induced transcription from these promoters. An RNA polymerase holocomplex containing purified σLitS recombinant protein generated specific PcrtE and PcrtY transcripts in an in vitro runoff transcriptional assay. A litR mutant that had an insertion of the kanamycin resistance gene was defective both in the ability to produce carotenoids and in all of the light-dependent promoter activities. Overexpression of litS resulted in constitutive carotenoid production in both the wild type and the litR mutant. These results indicate that σLitS acts as a light-induced sigma factor that directs transcription of the crt biosynthesis gene cluster, whose activity is controlled by an unknown LitR function.

For protein coding regions, powerful tests of natural selection have been developed based on comparisons of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions, and analogous tests for <b>regulatory</b> <b>regions</b> would be of great utility. Results Here, tests for natural selection on <b>regulatory</b> <b>regions</b> are proposed based on nucleotide substitutions that occur in characterized transcription factor binding sites ({{an important}} type functional element within <b>regulatory</b> <b>regions).</b> In the absence of selection, these substitutions will tend to reduce the strength of existing binding sites. On the other hand, purifying selection will act to preserve the binding sites in <b>regulatory</b> <b>regions,</b> while positive selection can act to create or destroy binding sites, as well as change their strength. Using standard models of binding site strength and molecular evolution in the absence of selection, this intuition can be used to develop statistical tests for natural selection.

This information was obtained through annotation of 2537 scientific publications. TRRD 4. 2. 5 is available through the WWW at [URL]...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} the relative growth advantages of polyomavirus <b>regulatory</b> <b>region</b> mutants selected from Friend leukemic and neuroblastoma cells persistently infected with polyomavirus A 2 wild type, different murine cell lines, {{some of which}} are capable of further differentiation in vitro, were used as hosts in mixed infection and transfection. The tests allowed the determination, through the measurement of cis-advantage in replication, of the most effective polyomavirus <b>regulatory</b> <b>region</b> constitutions for a given cell line and, in some cases, for specific stages of cell differentiation. Furthermore, different domains of the viral <b>regulatory</b> <b>region</b> were shown to have different effects [...] positive, neutral, or negative [...] depending on the host analyzed...|$|R

40|$|Three {{databases}} {{that provide}} data on transcriptional regulation are described. TRANSFAC is a database on transcription factors and their DNA binding sites. TRRD (Transcription <b>Regulatory</b> <b>Region</b> Database) collects information about complete <b>regulatory</b> <b>regions,</b> their regulation properties and architecture. COMPEL comprises specific information on composite regulatory elements. Here, {{we describe the}} present status of these databases and the first steps towards their federation...|$|R

In ANISEED, a sophisticated {{representation of the}} structure of cis-regulatory elements and their upstream regulators was designed. AMIS details the minimal information to describe a <b>regulatory</b> <b>region.</b> To facilitate <b>regulatory</b> <b>region</b> data transfer between databases, a document type definition (DTD) was developed, following the AMIS rules...|$|R
40|$|JC virus (JCV) with an archetypal <b>regulatory</b> <b>region</b> (archetype) {{has been}} cloned from urines {{of a healthy}} individual. It has been {{suggested}} that the <b>regulatory</b> <b>region</b> of prototype JC virus (PML type) isolated from brain of PML patient was derived from that of the archetype by deletion and duplication. Biological characteristics of archetypal JCV, however, have not been fully studied. In the present study we examined the infectivity of archetypal JCV (CY), PML-type JCV (Mad- 1) and Chimera JCV (Mad- 1 /CR-CY), in which the <b>regulatory</b> <b>region</b> is composed of CY and the other region Mad- 1. DNAs from the three JCV types were transfected into COS- 7 (monkey kidney cells transformed with SV 40 T) and IMR- 32 (human neuroblastoma cell). COS- 7 was permissive for all three types, but IMR- 32 was only infected with Mad- 1. Infected DNAs were confirmed by Southern blotting, and the constancy of the <b>regulatory</b> <b>regions</b> before and after transmission was verified by DNA sequencing. The results showed that the viral <b>regulatory</b> <b>region</b> was related to viral cell tropism and that PML type <b>regulatory</b> <b>region</b> would be necessary for IMR- 32 to propagate. The fact that COS- 7 was susceptible for all three types may be explained by the function of S V 40 T protein. In addition, we first succeeded in the propagation of CY in COS- 7, which would provide a useful system to analyze the mechanism of persistent infection of archetypal JCV.

40|$|In {{addition}} to efficiently decreasing VLDL-triglycerides (TGs), fenofibrate increases HDL-cholesterol levels in humans. We investigated whether the fenofibrate-induced increase in HDL-cholesterol {{is dependent on}} the expression of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). To this end, APOE* 3 -Leiden (E 3 L) transgenic mice without and with the human CETP transgene, under the control of its natural <b>regulatory</b> <b>flanking</b> <b>regions,</b> were fed a Western-type diet with or without fenofibrate. Fenofibrate (0. 04 % in the diet) decreased plasma TG in E 3 L and E 3 L. CETP mice (- 259 % and - 60 %; P< 0. 001), caused by a strong reduction in VLDL. Whereas fenofibrate did not affect HDL-cholesterol in E 3 L mice, fenofibrate dose-dependently increased HDL-cholesterol in E 3 L. CETP mice (up to + 91 %). Fenofibrate did not affect the turnover of HDL-cholesteryl ester (CE), indicating that fenofibrate causes a higher steady-state HDL-cholesterol level without altering the HDL-cholesterol flux through plasma. Analysis of the hepatic gene expression profile showed that fenofibrate did not differentially affect the main players in HDL metabolism in E 3 L. CETP mice compared with E 3 L mice. However, in E 3 L. CETP mice, fenofibrate reduced hepatic CETP mRNA (- 272 %; P < 0. 01) as well as the CE transfer activity in plasma (- 73 %; P, 0. 01). We conclude that fenofibrate increases HDL-cholesterol by reducing the CETP-dependent transfer of cholesterol from HDL to (V) LDL, as related to lower hepatic CETP expression and a reduced plasma (V) LDL pool...|$|R
