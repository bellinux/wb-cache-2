5|$|The first {{railway bridge}} to Montreal Island was the Grand Trunk Railway {{bridge across the}} Ottawa River East Channel. Along with another bridge built {{simultaneously}} across the West Channel, this bridge provided the first fixed link from Montreal to the mainland. It was not until 1925, however, that a fixed road link, formed by Galipeault Bridge and Taschereau Bridge, was built across the Ottawa River from Montreal Island. Perrot Island {{was the only way}} out of Montreal to the West before the construction of Île aux Tourtes Bridge, which <b>goes</b> <b>directly</b> to Vaudreuil across the Lake of Two Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{have one}} of the most complex {{respiratory}} systems of all animal groups. Upon inhalation, 75% of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. The other 25% of the air <b>goes</b> <b>directly</b> into the lungs. When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lungs and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation. Sound production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from {{the lower end of the}} trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalisations and the perception of the bird's size.|$|E

40|$|This {{study used}} a {{national}} sample of PhD students in clinical psychology (N = 1, 034) to explore when students {{decided to pursue}} their graduate degree, reasons for their decisions, and associated satisfaction. Results indicated that immediately after completing their undergraduate degree, 57 % of current graduate students reported postponing graduate studies, 10 % <b>went</b> <b>directly</b> to a terminal master’s program, and 33 % <b>went</b> <b>directly</b> to a clinical psychology PhD program. A variety of reasons for these decisions were documented. Individuals who postponed graduate school were significantly more satisfied with their decision than individuals who <b>went</b> <b>directly</b> to a terminal master’s program and reported less frequent thoughts of withdrawal from their program than individuals who <b>went</b> <b>directly</b> to a clinical psychology PhD program. Implications for undergraduate advisors are discussed...|$|R

25|$|Anthony's Nose, {{the second}} highest peak, can be {{accessed}} from Tom Mays park by an unofficial trail originating from the C5 campsite(parking {{is at the same}} place as for the Aztec Cave trail). From the C5 campsite, the trail gradually winds uphill to the left, then <b>goes</b> <b>directly</b> up to the ridgeline across a narrow rocky pass. The trail then follows the ridgeline northward about 2 miles directly to Anthony's Nose. Although no technical gear is needed, {{there are a couple of}} difficult climbing areas along the way and the entire round trip takes about 10 hours. Once again, it is not an official trail, so it is not as well-maintained as other trails in the park.|$|E
25|$|In narcolepsy, {{the order}} and length of NREM and REM sleep periods are disturbed, with REM sleep {{occurring}} at sleep onset instead of {{after a period of}} NREM sleep. Also, some aspects of REM sleep that normally occur only during sleep, like lack of muscular control, sleep paralysis, and vivid dreams, occur at other times in people with narcolepsy. For example, the lack of muscular control can occur during wakefulness in a cataplexy episode; it is said that there is intrusion of REM atonia during wakefulness. Sleep paralysis and vivid dreams can occur while falling asleep or waking up. Simply put, the brain does not pass through the normal stages of dozing and deep sleep but <b>goes</b> <b>directly</b> into (and out of) rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.|$|E
