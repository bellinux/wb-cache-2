50|$|The Riefler {{escape wheel}} and pallets {{are of a}} special design. There are {{actually}} two escape wheels mounted on the same shaft and two surfaces {{on each of the}} two pallet pins. The front locking wheel has forward pointing teeth rather like a dead-beat escapement, and catches on the flat surface of the pallet to lock the wheel. The rear <b>impulse</b> <b>wheel</b> has teeth with a sloping surface facing the direction of rotation. The round part of each pallet is acted upon by this surface to give the impulse.|$|E

5000|$|Rather than pallets, the {{escapement}} uses a cutaway cylinder on {{the balance}} wheel shaft, which the escape teeth enter one by one. [...] Each wedge-shaped tooth <b>impulses</b> the balance <b>wheel</b> by pressure on the cylinder edge as it enters, is held inside the cylinder as it turns, and <b>impulses</b> the <b>wheel</b> again as it leaves out the other side. The wheel usually had 15 teeth, and impulsed the balance over an angle of 20° to 40° in each direction. [...] It is a frictional rest escapement, with the teeth {{in contact with the}} cylinder over the whole balance wheel cycle, and so was not as accurate as [...] "detached" [...] escapements like the lever, and the high friction forces caused excessive wear and necessitated more frequent cleaning.|$|R
50|$|It {{could be}} {{regarded}} as having its distant origins in the escapement invented by Robert Robin, C.1792, which gives a single impulse in one direction; with the locking achieved by passive lever pallets, {{the design of the}} coaxial escapement is more akin to that of another Robin variant, the Fasoldt escapement, which was invented and patented by the American Charles Fasoldt in 1859.Both Robin and Fasoldt escapements give impulse in one direction only.The latter escapement has a lever with unequal drops; this engages with two escape wheels of differing diameters. The smaller <b>impulse</b> <b>wheel</b> acts on the single pallet {{at the end of the}} lever, whilst the pointed lever pallets lock on the larger wheel.The balance engages with and is impelled by the lever through a roller pin and lever fork. The lever 'anchor' pallet locks the larger wheel and, on this being unlocked, a pallet on the end of the lever is given an impulse by the smaller wheel through the lever fork. The return stroke is 'dead', with the 'anchor' pallets serving only to lock and unlock, impulse being given in one direction through the single lever pallet.As with the duplex, the locking wheel is larger in order to reduce pressure and thus friction.|$|E

50|$|A {{hydroelectric}} dam {{and power}} plant {{were built in}} the canyon in the late 1910s by the Sinks Canyon Hydro Power Company and became operational by January 1920. The purpose of the plant was to supply nearby Lander with more reliable electricity. Power generation was possible most of the year except during winter months because water levels become too low. The design of the system consisted of a small stone-concrete dam standing 9 feet high and 60 feet wide built on the Popo Agie River a short distance upstream. The dam connected to the power house located at the Rise via a 3,145 foot long riveted-steel pipeline with a diameter of between 30 and 26 inches. The pipeline allowed water to flow at a rate of 17 feet per second until reaching the power house. The power house contained two 47 inch 250 horsepower hug <b>impulse</b> <b>wheels,</b> each spun by two 3 inch diameter water nozzles. The two wheels were controlled by two separate Lombard oil-pressure generators which were connected to a 150-kilowatt 3 phase 60 cycle alternating-current generator operating at 2,300 volts. The power was transmitted at 11,000 volts over a copper circuit suspended by cedar poles to Lander and South Pass City as well as some oil extraction projects in the area. The plant operated until around 1954 when it was shut down due to its age and cheaper sources of electricity becoming available.|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 85 - 90 The {{prevailing}} use {{of expansion}} gases in distribution stations can be economically {{replaced by the}} application of turbo expanders. The advantage of turbine <b>impulse</b> <b>wheels</b> {{is that they have}} high efficiencies, even at very low partial load. With a single valve control easily programmable, seven valve points can be achieved with three control valves. Thereby, throttle losses can be minimized. The design of the valves and their drives can be adapted to the operation requirements. Bearings and couplings are deleted by a combination of expander and gear in one unit, resulting in less power loss, lower investments, and higher availability. The advantages of planetary gears compared to helicals are higher efficiency, smoother running, lower tooth loads, lower noise, and smaller plot plan. This results in secondary advantages such as smaller oil systems, baseplates, and foundations. The disadvantages are higher quality requirements regarding production and more components which, however, are smaller. When an automatic clutch is used, the LP section is shut down as soon as the gas mass flow is zero. The LP section is back into operation within a few seconds after having gas flow. The plant operates fully automatically without operators and maintenance personnel being present at the location. The economic application of expansion turbines used for energy recovery depends not only on a turbine, but on all plant components. The gain of the useful energy is higher than the expenditure of investments, operating costs and maintenance costs. The possibilities of energy recuperation from the natural gas pressure in distributing mains shall be demonstrated by means of an example. The natural gas distribution station of a large German town is supplied from a 41 bar distribution main and transmits the natural gas in two networks of 13 bar or 5 bar. Previously, the natural gas was depressured through throttle valves, and the energy contained in the natural gas was destroyed. Now the gas expansion will be used for the generation of electric energy by the use of expansion turbines...|$|R

His mathematical and graphical calculation methods allowed confident design of high efficiency turbines to exactly match a site's specific flow conditions. The Francis reaction turbine is still in wide use today.

25|$|Water {{was brought}} to the mill in an open ditch (zanja) from Los Robles and Kewen Canyons, and stored in a large cistern. For the mill itself, Father Zalvidea {{designed}} an unusual horizontal, direct <b>impulse</b> water <b>wheel.</b> There were three vaulted water chambers on the ground floor and a single horizontal water wheel. The water wheel was attached to a vertical shaft that went up to the second level (the current entrance room) where the grinding stones were located. One of the grinding stones was attached to the shaft, and rotated along with the water wheel. A second stone was placed above the rotating stone, with corn and grain between the stones. It is suspected that the force of the water from the cistern was not sufficient to start the wheel turning with the required force, and that a leather thong was wrapped around the shaft and pulled by Indians to start the wheel. The upper-most room, used now as an art gallery, was used for storage of the final product. After the water flowed out of the mill, it was channeled into a lake down hill from the mill. The lake has since dried up and is now the site of San Marino's Lacy Park.|$|R
50|$|After {{the exit}} tooth locks, the balance wheel rotates anti-clockwise, free of {{interference}} from the escapement until the balance spring pulls it back clockwise, and the impulse pin re-enters the fork. This will unlock the escapement, releasing the escape wheel {{so that the}} exit tooth can slide over the impulse plane of the exit pallet, which transfers a clockwise impulse to the balance <b>wheel's</b> <b>impulse</b> pin via the lever fork, while pushing the lever up against the left banking pin. The escape wheel drops again until the entrance tooth locks on the entrance pallet now being {{held in place by}} the left banking pin via the lever. The balance wheel continues clockwise, again free from interference until it is pulled back by the balance spring to the center position. The cycle then starts again.|$|R

Contrary {{to the existing}} method, it analyzes the time-frequency features of mechanical watch movement {{through a combination of}} reassigned scalogram and Finite Element Analysis (FEA). By mapping the signal into a 2 D domain of time and frequency, the reassigned scalogram reveals the frequency components of the shocks at different time. On the other hand, FEA gives the modal frequencies of the movements. By comparing the frequency components at different shocks to the modal frequencies of the movement, possible malfunctions of the movement can then be detected.

50|$|After initial {{experiments}} with {{electricity in the}} late 1890s, Kellow planned the electrification of the quarry in 1901. By utilising the reservoir in the Cwm Foel valley, located at 1460 ft above sea level, and siting the generating station near {{the foot of the}} incline up to the quarry, he obtained a head of 860 ft to drive his large hydro-electric turbines. Standard British practice at the time was to use 550-volt direct current for such work, but Kellow thought this was too high for distribution underground, and the cost of cabling for a lower voltage system was prohibitive. He found references to a new system of three-phase alternating current, but was unable to find British manufacturers who thought it was sensible, or who would make equipment to work with it. He produced a full specification for a three-phase plant in 1902, and toured Europe, talking to electrical manufacturers, who he found more supportive of his plans. He bought the equipment from Kolben and Company of Prague. It consisted of a 250kVa alternator, which he would couple to a 375 hp pelton <b>wheel</b> <b>impulse</b> turbine. A separate 25 hp impulse turbine supplied the exciter circuit, providing good voltage regulation, and it provided enough spare power to light and heat his house. Power was generated at just below 3000 volts, and transformed down to 220 volts between phases at the point of use.|$|R

Tyto děje se odehrávají v povrchových vrstvách kontaktně vázaných těles s rozměrem 10 - 4 - 10 - 5 m, kde dochází ke strukturním změnám, včetně vzniku oblastí doposud metalograficky nepopsaných. Pro získání informací, které vedou k modifikaci v současné době akceptovaných mezních stavů je nezbytné realizovat řízený experiment sledující historii kontaktního zatížení. Z dosavadních metalografických sledování lze považovat za prokázané, že prvotně probíhající proces plastických deformací, jehož důsledkem je zpevnění objemů materiálu v kontaktní oblasti, má dominantní vliv na vznik a rozvoj povrchových vad. Jelikož při analýze se nelze opírat o fenomenologické konstanty materiálu, musí numerické modelování selhávat a naopak, experimentální výzkum nelze opírat o konvenční zařízení (např. Amsler). Z uvedených důvodů je na DFJP vyvinuto a realizováno speciální zkušební zařízení, jehož funkce je v příspěvku diskutována. Long-standing {{problems of}} damaging contact surfaces of rail wheels demand {{an extension of}} research works which will aim {{at some of the}} new approaches towards the issue of limiting state of environment which is formed, by rolling of generally loaded wheel, in the area of surface layers of running surface. The presented research programme is mainly based on the proven fact that specific problems of a rail wheel life are based on degradation actions caused by a complicated loading in the area of contact which is specific for the wheels that are braked by disk brakes. Such system of braking is, at present, consistently applied mainly to the sets of passenger train carriages and tends to extend also to sets of goods trains. Specificity of the issue of such braked wheels was reliably proven by the occurrence of continuing damages of wheel surfaces when compared with the wheels that are braked by block brakes. The specificity is mainly caused by diametrically different thermal processes in the area of contact. The character of thermal effects of wheels, which are not in contact with brake blocks, requires the viewpoint of microscopic transmission of heat, which does not exclude its wave propagation in a thin surface layer with all possible effects owing to the limiting states. Lot of works, see herein cited literary sources, point out emerging microstructural changes combined with mechanical damaging of contact surfaces, and the thickness of affected layers was predicted by dimension to order 10 - 4 mm. It also corresponds with the results of analyses describing so far insufficiently explained hard structures termed as White Etching Layers. Another finding, arising from conclusions of performed researches, {{is the fact that the}} entire structural anomalies are localized right in the surface layer that is becoming a potential area from which the defects can be spread into a basic and unaffected material of the wheel. It can be started from the work hypothesis that the entire actions in the surface layer have a dynamic character and that they differ from the actions rising in the basic material. In other words, a distinct material discontinuity can be formed by contact effects. One of the essential problems is a detailed study of the process of surface layer plastization, therefore the main aim of the presented investigation is both theoretical and experimental study of that contact area. From the point of view of metallographic experiments, the research was focussed on the level of homogeneity of plastic deformations, its rise influenced by contact loading and the effects resulting from further exploitation arising from continuous generating of a loaded wheel. Insufficient attention has been drawn to vibratory motions of surface layer particles. It is obvious from some of the published works, that the character of motion of surface particles, which are evoked by slip processes, can be considered as self-excited oscillation of relaxation type, which can result in the rise of penetrative dynamic powers in tangential direction having <b>impulse</b> character. Adhesive <b>wheel</b> rolling leads to tribologic effects of dynamic character. Dynamic aspects of wheel contact with rail have not been studied from the viewpoint of wave effect spreading yet. Therefore, the aim of the presented research is to study contact as dynamic joining of two continua in which, besides compression wave motion, surface Rayleigh and Loevov waves are propagated with respect to a limited environment. The answer to the problem of how much above mentioned wave effects could affect the limiting states of surface layers has been sought by a theoretical solution. The issue of plastization is emphasised also on the basis of theoretical studies which are based on numerical modelling. Important studies which arise from bilinear material characteristics are stated in the above mentioned literature. The authors of the paper intend to form an essential orientation in energy balance of plastic deformations by the study of energy balance of contact on the base of phenomenological plasticity. These processes, whose results is a higher hardness level, can be comprehensivelly experimentally studied on the current testing equipment that has been assembled in laboratories of the Jan Perner Transport Faculty, University of Pardubice, for experimental observing of oscillation of surface layer particles on the railway wheel running surface interrelating to wear processes and processes clarifying adhesive transfer of power. Within the realised research, a required modification of current testing equipment with a view to generating plastic deformations and consequent hardness of surface layers of inserted material samples was realised. The way of history mapping of running surface loading could be searched by this way. The way was necessary for the stating of new ideas about limiting state in the area of contact. Original know-how, on which bases it will be possible to contribute to improvement of the knowledge of adhesive transfer in contact, has been expected as secondary results of these investigations. From the point of view of material, the knowledge of optimization process of choice for suitable construction wheel material can be expected in near future, with regard to constant standard of rail as well as railway wheel applied material...|$|R
