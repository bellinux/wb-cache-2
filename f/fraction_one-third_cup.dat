We have used Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism to demonstrate the limitations of fluorescence microscopy for imaging of lipids compared with coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy, the latter allowing chemically specific and label-free imaging in living organisms. CARS microscopy was used to quantitatively monitor the impact of genetic variations in metabolic pathways on lipid storage in 60 specimens of C. elegans. We found that the feeding-defective mutant pha- 3 contained a lipid volume <b>fraction</b> <b>one-third</b> of that found in control worms. In contrast, mutants (daf- 2, daf- 4 dauer) with deficiencies in the insulin and transforming growth factors (IGF and TGF-beta) signaling pathways had lipid volume fractions that were 1. 4 and 2 times larger than controls, respectively. This was observed as an accumulation of small-sized lipid droplets in the hypodermal cells, hosting as much as 40 % of the total lipid volume {{in contrast to the}} 9 % for the wild-type larvae. Spectral CARS microscopy measurements indicated that this is accompanied by a shift in the ordering of the lipids from gel to liquid phase. We conclude that the degree of hypodermal lipid storage and the lipid phase {{can be used as a}} marker of lipid metabolism shift. This study shows that CARS microscopy has the potential to become a sensitive and important tool for studies of lipid storage mechanisms, improving our {{understanding of}} phenomena underlying metabolic disorders...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Uranium behaves as {{a nearly}} {{conservative}} element in oxygenated seawater, {{but it is}} precipitated under chemically reducing conditions that occur in sediments underlying low-oxygen bottom water or in sediments receiving high fluxes of particulate organic carbon. Sites characterized by a range of bottom-water oxygen (BWO) and organic carbon flux (OCF) were studied {{to better understand the}} conditions that determine formation and preservation of authigenic U in marine sediments. Our study areas are located in the mid latitudes of the northeast Pacific and the northwest Atlantic Oceans, and all sites receive moderate (0. 5 g/cm 2 kyr) to high (2. 8 g/cm 2 kyr) OCF to the sediments. BWO concentrations vary substantially among the sites, ranging from 3 to 270 M. A mass balance approach was used to evaluate authigenic U remobilization at each site. Within each region studied, the supply of particulate nonlithogenic U associated with sinking particles was evaluated by means of sediment traps. The diffusive flux of U into sediments was calculated from pore-water U concentration profiles. These combined sources were compared with the burial rate of authigenic U to assess the efficiency of its preservation. A large <b>fraction</b> (<b>one-third</b> to two-thirds) of the authigenic U precipitated in these sediments via diffusion supply is later regenerated, even under very low BWO concentrations (15 M). Bioturbating organisms periodically mix authigenic U-containing sediment upward toward the sediment–water interface, where more oxidizing conditions lead to the remobilization of authigenic U and its loss to bottom waters.

40|$|AbstractRecent {{information}} {{has suggested that}} early diastolic filling {{may be influenced by}} the left ventricular filling pressure, especially in the failing left ventricle. Acute severe left ventricular dysfunction was induced in 14 dogs by severe left ventricular global ischemia produced by left main coronary artery microsphere embolization until the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was >_ 20 mm Hg. To assess the importance of left ventricular filling pressure on left ventricular diastolic filling, nitroglycerin was infused and titrated to reduce left ventricular end-diastolic pressure to < 15 mm Hg in seven dogs, whereas the remaining seven dogs were observed for 1 h after acute severe left ventricular dysfunction. In both groups of dogs, severe left ventricular dysfunction resulted in left ventricular dilation and elevation of end-diastolic pressure, reduction in area ejection fraction (echocardiographically determined) and an early redistribution of diastolic filling (increased filling <b>fractions</b> at <b>one-third</b> and one-half diastole) despite prolongation of the time constant of left ventricular pressure decline. Pressure-area plots shifted upward and rightward with severe left ventricular dysfunction and were unchanged at 1 h as were all other variables. Nitroglycerin infusion reduced left ventricular size and filling pressure, redistributed diastolic filling to later in diastole as characterized by reduced filling <b>fraction</b> at <b>one-third</b> diastole (left ventricular dysfunction 48. 8 ± 9. 7 %, nitroglycerin 17. 9 ± 7. 9 %, p < 0. 001) and shifted downward left ventricular pressure-area plots. Nitroglycerin also improved the time constant of relaxation (left ventricular dysfunction 83 ± 15 ms, nitroglycerin 52 ± 15 ms, p < 0. 001) and lengthened the diastolic filling period.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} degree to which sexual side effects (SSE) are {{associated}} with prolactin-raising antipsychotics, and to what degree such SSE are reducible to serum prolactin levels. Method: A large sample (n = 264) of patients treated for 6 weeks with protactin-raising and prolactin-sparing antipsychotics was assessed for changes in sexual performance in terms of libido, arousal and orgasm using the Antipsychotics and Sexual Functioning Questionnaire. For men also erection and ejaculation were evaluated. At 6 weeks, prolactin levels were assessed and analyzed in relation to sexual performance. Results: Men and women reported SSE (libido and orgasm) with about the same frequency. Prolactin-raising medication induced significantly more SSE than prolactin-sparing medication (adjusted OR = 3. 4, 95 % CI: 1. 8, 6. 5) with 43 % of emerging SSE attributable to prolactin-raising medication. When adjusted for serum prolactin, the association between prolactin-raising medication and SSE was reduced but remained significant (OR = 2. 1, 95 % CI: 1. 0, 4. 5); 27 % of emerging SSE remained attributable to prolactin-raising medication. For erectile and ejaculatory dysfunction in men, the attributable fraction due to prolactin-raising medication was 32 % before, and 11 % after adjustment for serum prolactin. Conclusions: Around 40 % of emerging SSE in schizophrenia are attributable to the prolactin-raising properties of antipsychotic medication.

The incomplete reductive dechlorination of PCE [...] resulting in accumulations of trichloroethene, dichloroethene isomers, and/or vinyl chloride [...] has been observed by many investigators {{in a wide variety}} of methanogenic environments. Previous mixed-culture studies have demonstrated that complete dechlorination to ethene is possible, although the final dechlorination step from vinyl chloride to ethene is rate limiting, with significant levels of vinyl chloride typically persisting. In this study, anaerobic methanol-PCE enrichment cultures which proved capable of dechlorinating high concentrations PCE to ethene were developed. Added concentrations of PCE as high as 550 microM (91 -mg/liter nominal concentration; approximately 55 -mg/liter actual aqueous concentration) were routinely dechlorinated to 80 % ethene and 20 % vinyl chloride within 2 days at 35 degrees C. The methanol level used was approximately twice that needed for complete dechlorination of PCE to ethene. The observed transformations occurred in the absence of methanogenesis, which was apparently inhibited by the high concentrations of PCE. When incubation was allowed to proceed for as long as 4 days, virtually complete conversion of PCE to ethene resulted, with less than 1 % persisting as vinyl chloride. An electron balance demonstrated that methanol consumption was completely accounted for by dechlorination (31 %) and acetate production (69 %).

To this aim, a procedure was developed to prepare highly purified vacuoles from protoplasts isolated from Arabidopsis cell cultures using Ficoll density gradients. Based on the specific activity of the vacuolar marker alpha-mannosidase, the enrichment factor of the vacuoles was estimated at approximately 42 -fold with an average yield of 2. 1 %. Absence of significant contamination by other cellular compartments was validated by Western blot using antibodies raised against specific markers of chloroplasts, mitochondria, plasma membrane, and endoplasmic reticulum. Based on these results, vacuole preparations showed the necessary degree of purity for proteomics study. Therefore, a proteomics approach was developed to identify the protein components present in both the membrane and soluble fractions of the Arabidopsis cell vacuoles. This approach includes the following: (i) a mild oxidation step leading to the transformation of cysteine residues into cysteic acid and methionine to methionine sulfoxide, (ii) an in-solution proteolytic digestion of very hydrophobic proteins, and (iii) a prefractionation of proteins by short migration by SDS-PAGE followed by analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. This procedure allowed the identification of more than 650 proteins, two-thirds of which copurify with the membrane hydrophobic <b>fraction</b> and <b>one-third</b> of which copurifies with the soluble fraction.

Wind and waves kick up spray, and bits of sodium {{chloride}} [...] common table salt [...] can permeate the air. It is believed {{that as much as}} 10 billion metric tons of chloride enters the air mass through this process each year, but just a tiny <b>fraction</b> [...] perhaps <b>one-third</b> of 1 percent [...] does anything but fall back to the surface. The bit of chloride lingering in the air can react with nitrogen oxides, formed when fuel is burned at high temperature, to form nitryl chloride, a forerunner of chlorine atoms, the most reactive form of chlorine. Those atoms can contribute to smog formation in coastal areas. Now, in a surprise, researchers have found that this chemistry thought to be restricted to sea spray occurs at similar rates in air above Boulder, Colo., nearly 900 miles away from any ocean. What's more, local air quality measurements taken in a number of national parks across the United States imply similar conditions in or near other non-coastal metropolitan areas. "It's there. We know it's there. But we don't have a good handle on where that chloride comes from, " said Joel Thornton, a University of Washington associate professor of atmospheric sciences and lead author of a paper documenting the findings, published March 11 in Nature...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSandy uplands of {{northeast}} Thailand have subsoils with high resistance to root penetration that varies {{even though there}} is no variation in bulk density (Db). The objective {{of this study was to}} determine how the resistance to penetration in these soils is related to the size, mineralogy, and arrangement of the elementary particles. We studied the tilled topsoil (Ap horizon), upper subsoil (E horizon), and lower subsoil (Bt horizon) of an Arenic Haplustalf. Results showed similar skeleton grain-size distribution in the three horizons. Results also showed similar Db in the E and Bt horizons, and higher resistance to penetration in the E horizon. Dispersion of the material indicated the absence of a cementing agent between elementary particles. The < 2 -µm fraction content was 37, 53, and 88 g kg- 1 in the Ap, E, and Bt horizons, respectively, and that <b>fraction</b> was about <b>one-third</b> quartz. The clay minerals were kaolinite with a small amount of swelling 2 : 1 clays in the Ap and Bt horizons. Mercury porosimetry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed a closer arrangement of the sand resulting in less interparticle porosity in the E horizon than in the Bt horizon. The smaller interparticle porosity in the E horizon was compensated for by greater macroporosity resulting from biological activity, thus explaining the similar Db in the E and Bt horizons. Despite similar Db, the greater penetration resistance in the E horizon results from a close packing of sand particles that restricts the displacement of soil particles during penetration by probe or roots...|$|R
40|$|The apoplastic {{permeability}} of the fungal sheath of {{two different}} ectomycorrhizal associations of Pinus sylvestris L. was analysed by laser microprobe mass analysis (LAMMA) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) after stable isotope labelling with Mg- 25, K- 41 and Ca- 44. Entry of Mg- 25 and Ca- 41 into the outer cortical apoplast of non-mycorrhizal roots was detected after 4 min of labelling. After a longer exposure time the endodermis with its Casparian band acted as an efficient apoplastic diffusion barrier for the radial movement of Mg- 25 and Ca- 44 into the stele. A <b>fraction</b> of approximately <b>one-third</b> of the apoplastic cations of the root cortex could not be exchanged against the external label even after longer exposure times. The ectomycorrhizal sheath of the two fungal species used, Pisolithus tinctorius (Pers.) Coker & Couch and Suillus bovinus (L. ex Fr.) Kuntze, does not completely inhibit the apoplastic movement of ions into the mycorrhizal root cortex, but retarded the penetration of isotopes into the cortical apoplast. In roots inoculated with S. bovinus, a clear labelling of the cortical apoplast could first be detected after 24 h {{of exposure to the}} stable isotope solution. At this time the labelling of the cortical apoplast in these mycorrhizal roots was higher than those of non-mycorrhizal roots and, with EDXS, changes in the element composition of the apoplast were detected. The results indicated that possibly hydrophobins localized in the fungal cell wall might be involved in the increased hydrophobicity of mycorrhizal roots and the lower permeability of the ectomycorrhizal sheath...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies in}} yeast have {{supported}} the view that post-transcriptional regulation of protein abundances {{may be more important}} than previously believed. Here we ask the question: “In a physiological regulatory process (the response of mammalian kidney cells to the hormone vasopressin), what fraction of the expressed proteome undergoes a change in abundance and what fraction of the regulated proteins have corresponding changes in mRNA levels?” In humans and other mammals, vasopressin fulfills a vital homeostatic role (viz. regulation of renal water excretion) by regulating the water channel aquaporin- 2 in collecting duct cells. To address the question posed, we utilized large-scale quantitative protein mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) employing stable isotopic labeling in cultured mpkCCD cells (‘SILAC’) coupled with transcriptomic profiling using oligonucleotide expression arrays (Affymetrix). Preliminary studies analyzing two nominally identical control samples by SILAC LC-MS/MS yielded a relative S. D. of 13 % (for ratios), establishing the precision of the SILAC approach in our hands. We quantified nearly 3000 proteins with nontargeted SILAC LC-MS/MS, comparing vasopressin- versus vehicle-treated samples. Of these proteins 786 of them were quantified in each of 3 experiments, allowing statistical analysis and 188 of these showed significant vasopressin-induced changes in abundance, including aquaporin- 2 (20 -fold increase). Among the proteins with statistically significant abundance changes, a large <b>fraction</b> (at least <b>one-third)</b> was found to lack changes in the corresponding mRNA species (despite sufficient statistical power), indicating that post-transcriptional regulation of protein abundance {{plays an important role in}} the vasopressin response. Bioinformatic analysis of the regulated proteins (versus all transcripts) shows enrichment of glutathione S-transferase isoforms as well as proteins involved in organization of the actin cytoskeleton. The latter suggests that long-term regulatory processes may contribute to actomyosin-dependent trafficking of the water channel aquaporin- 2. The results provide impetus for increased focus on translational regulation and regulation of protein degradation in physiological control in mammalian epithelial cells...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a survey of 5, 000 {{households}} in the Greater Mumbai Region conducted in the winter of 2004. The goal of the survey was to better understand the demand for transport services by the poor, the factors affecting this demand, and the inter-linkages between transport decisions and other vital decisions such as where to live and work. This paper, the first of several research outputs, describes the salient facts about travel patterns in Mumbai for both poor and non-poor households. A striking finding of the survey {{is the extent to which}} all households-especially poor households-rely on walking. Overall, 44 percent of commuters in Mumbai walk to work. The proportion of the poor who walk to work is even higher- 63 percent. Walking is an even higher modal share for nonwork than for work trips. A second finding is that public transit remains an important factor in the mobility of the poor, and especially in the mobility of the middle class. Overall, rail remains the main mode to work for 23 percent of commuters, while bus remains the main mode for 16 percent of commuters. The modal shares for bus are highest for the poor in zones 1 - 3 (21 percent of the poor in zone 2 take the bus to work), while rail shares are highest for the poor in the suburbs (25 percent of the poor in zone 6 take rail to work). Isthe cost and lack of accessibility to transit a barrier to the mobility of the poor? Does it keep them from obtaining better housing and better jobs? This is a difficult question to answer without further analysis of the survey data. But it appears that transport is less of a barrier to the poor who live in central Mumbai (zones 1 - 3) than it is to the poor who live in the suburbs (zones 4 - 6). The poor who live in zones 1 - 3 (central Mumbai) live closer to the non-poor than do poor households in the suburbs. They also live closer to higher-paying jobs for unskilled workers. Workers in these households, on average, commute short distances (less than 3 kilometers), although a non-negligible <b>fraction</b> of them (<b>one-third</b> in zone 2) take public transit to work. It is true that the cost of housing for the poor is higher in central Mumbai than in the suburbs, but the quality of slum housing is at least as good in central Mumbai as in the suburbs. The poor who live in the suburbs of Mumbai, especially in zones 5 and 6, are more isolated from the rich than the poor in central Mumbai: 37 percent of the poor live in zones 5 and 6, whereas only one-fifth of higher income groups do. Wages for skilled and unskilled labor are generally lower in zones 5 and 6 than in the central city, and it appears that unemployment rates for poor males are also higher in these zones. The lower cost of slum and chawl housing in zones 5 and 6 may partly compensate for lower wages. However, a larger proportion of workers in poor households leave zones 5 and 6 to work than is true for poor workers in other zones. Commuting distances are much higher for poor workers in the suburbs than for poor workers in zones 1 - 3.
