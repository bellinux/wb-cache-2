Remarkably, chronoamperometrically determined diffusion coefficients of Fc in [C 2 mim][NTf 2] are found to increase from 4. 8 (± 0. 2) × 10 - 11 m 2 s- 1 under vacuum conditions to 6. 6 (± 0. 5) × 10 - 11 m 2 s- 1 {{in an atmosphere of}} 1 atm Ar.

What {{we do know is}} that the human organism is a socially constructed being. We also know that there are species-specific human needs that play out in the formation of mental well being; there does exist a common denominator, if you will, of optimum conditions and relational situations that underly all human development. Mental health is an arena where the universality of human needs meets the specificity or relativity of cultural ways and experiences. Hence, mental health becomes an arena in which the organic realities of social structures like racism, sexism, etc., reveal themselves. Unfortunately, too many prefer to operate as if their practice and services did not in fact interface with the realities of onerous and destructive social structures (ie., ignoring racism and sexism and enforced poverty and all the other biases that drive the American way is still the preferred denial system of far too many individuals who create and administer mental health services).

Identification of the salient features which distinguish the Chicano from his Anglo counterpart are reviewed; this is provided in order to clarify the psycho- logical perspective of the Chicano and to <b>dispell</b> misconceptions regarding his culture and personality. The focus of American psychology and current therapeutic modalities is carefully examined. Here the findings demonstrate that American psychological thought is based on the following principles: (1) that there is a psychological universality of man and that his perceptions of reality universally coincide; (2) that the U. S. is a melting pot and that all Americans share the same goals, i. e. socioeconomic, educational, etc.; and (3) that these methods of psychological and counseling intervention espouse the American, Protestant ideals of individualism, materialism and hard work, and that philosophy and behavior which contrast with these ideals may be labeled as a type of psychological disorder, despite the client's philosophy of life. A definition of transcultural counseling philosophy and techniques is carefully examined and the relationship this form of counseling has on the Chicano. Also the concept of client cultural dissonance is introduced, not as a label, but as an insight into a problem which many Chicanos subconsciously face. The recognition of this concept creates a clearer understanding of the Chicano and his mental health experience.

40|$|In this paper, I am {{concerned}} with {{the relationship of the}} book of Daniel and the biblical wisdom literature. The study draws its impetus from the belief of von Rad that apocalyptic is the "child " of wisdom (1965, II, pp. 304 - 15). My intent is to test von Rad's claim by a study of wisdom terminology in Daniel in order to determine whether, in fact, that book {{has its roots in the}} wisdom tradition. Adequate evidence has been gathered to demonstrate a robust connection between the nar-ratives of Daniel 1 - 6 and mantic wisdom which employs the interpreta-tion of dreams, signs and visions (Millier, 1972; Collins, 1975). Here I {{am concerned}} to <b>dispell</b> the continuing notion that apocalyptic as ex-hibited in Daniel (especially in chapters 7 - 12) is the product of the same wisdom circles from which came the proverbial biblical books of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Job and the later Ben Sirach. 1 I am indebted to the work of Why bray (1974), who has dealt exhaustively with the terminology of biblical wisdom, and to the work of Crenshaw (1969), who, among others, has rightly cautioned that the presence of wisdom vocabulary is insufficient evidence of sapiential influence. 2 Whybray (1974, pp. 71 - 154) distinguishes four categories of wisdom terminology: a) words from the root J:ikm itself; b) other characteristic terms occurring only in the wisdom corpus (5 words); c) words char-acteristic of wisdom, but occurring so frequently in other contexts as to render their usefulness in determining sapiential influence questionable (23 words); and d) words characteristic of wisdom, but occurring only occasionally in other OT traditions (10 words). From a wisdom vocabulary of approximately 40 words thus isolated by Whybray, we find only six represented in Daniel: J:io/smii / J:iii. lsJi. m I.

40|$|Sarmiento {{aspires to}} a 2 ̆ 2 {{scientific}} 2 ̆ 2 historiography. He maintains that direct observation, {{free from the}} distortions of rhetoric, would make possible to discern hidden, unsconscious principles behind individual people and actions. He realizes, however, that those very transcendental principles make rhetoric unavoidable. 2 ̆ 2 Meaning 2 ̆ 2 acquires thus a new dimension. Earlier historians were concerned with the meaning of history, with the finality of human actions that made history comprehensible. Sarmiento, on the contrary, is preoccupied with meaning in history, with the hermeneutics of historiography. He contends that {{because there is a}} transcendental sense, our knowledge is conditioned and subjective. ^ Meaning is, then, at once a condition of and a threat to the rationality and predictability of time. Sarmiento implies that the history of his country is incomprehensible on the surface because it is determined, at a deep level, by the conflict between civilization and barbarism, a conflict which is not directly observable. Paradoxically, Sarmiento avoids defining the two principles. Therefore, criticism has reproached him for being nebulous and unsystematic. I argue, however, that the logic of eschatological determinism prevents him from giving univocal definitions. It he were to conclude, for example, 2 ̆ 2 barbarism is oppression, civilization is democracy, 2 ̆ 2 he would imply that ultimate determination comes from freedom and oppression, not from civilization and barbarism. The system, because it is transcendental, must be relativistic. ^ History reveals itself through signs, but signs are inadequate. Indeed, they are exactly the opposite of their referent. Seeking to write an unrhetorical history, Sarmiento published Facundo in a system of simplified spelling, believing that, if each letter corresponded to a sound, everyone could easily read and write. Universal literacy would almost automatically bring about democracy. In a literal sense, then, phonetic spelling represented educated consensus, civilization. In another sense, it represented a new cognitive disposition, a system of signs which were arbitrary but also decodable, since they exist in discrete, phonetic opposition to reality. Writing would then <b>dispell</b> meaninglessness by making it predictable. If Sarmiento could explain barbarism, it would vanish. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{specification}} of a mathematical object is impredicative if it essentially involves quantification over a domain {{which includes the}} object being specified (or sets which contain that object, or similar). The basic worry {{is that we have}} no non-circular way of understanding such a specification. Predicativism is the view that mathematics should be limited to the study of objects which can be specified predicatively. There are two parts to predicativism. One is the criticism of the impredicative aspects of classical mathematics. The other is the positive project, begun by Weyl in Das Kontinuum (1918), to reconstruct as much as possible of classical mathematics {{on the basis of a}} predicatively acceptable set theory, which accepts only countably infinite objects. This is a revisionary project, and certain parts of mathematics will not be saved. Chapter 2 contains an account of the historical background to the predicativist project. The rigorization of analysis led to Dedekind's and Cantor's theories of the real numbers, which relied on the new notion of abitrary infinite sets; this became a central part of modern classical set theory. Criticism began with Kronecker; continued in the debate about the acceptability of Zermelo's Axiom of Choice; and was somewhat clarified by Poincaré and Russell. In the light of this, chapter 3 examines the formulation of, and motivations behind the predicativist position. Chapter 4 begins the critical task by detailing the epistemological problems with the classical account of the continuum. Explanations of classicism which appeal to second-order logic, set theory, and primitive intuition are examined and are found wanting. Chapter 5 aims to <b>dispell</b> the worry that predicativism might collapses into mathematical intuitionism. I assess some of the arguments for intuitionism, especially the Dummettian argument from indefinite extensibility. I argue that the natural numbers are not indefinitely extensible, and that, although the continuum is, we can nonetheless make some sense of classical quantification over it. We need not reject the Law of Excluded Middle. Chapter 6 begins the positive work by outlining a predicatively acceptable account of mathematical objects which justifies the Vicious Circle Principle. Chapter 7 explores the appropriate shape of formalized predicative mathematics, and the question of just how much mathematics is predicatively acceptable. My conclusion is that all of the mathematics which we need can be predicativistically justified, and that such mathematics is particularly transparent to reason. This calls into question one currently prevalent view of the nature of mathematics, on which mathematics is justified by quasi-empirical means.

40|$|The {{intent of}} this study was to analyze the {{geographical}} and social mobility patterns of Muncie's population within the 1850 - 1880 period utilizing the "new urban history" methodology. The subject of urban history has assumed a prominent position in the present curricula of many colleges and universities. A major component of urban history is titled "new urban history. " Historians working under this rubic have adopted a research methodology distinct from that used in the past. This is a social science methodology which emphasizes the manipulation of quantitative data. It is this methodology which has distinguished the "new urban history" and the urban historians who utilize this approach. Stephan Thernstrom was one of the first "new urban historians" to use social science methodology in the study of large masses of urban dwellers. His purpose was to examine systematically the lives of those people who had previously gone unrecorded, but who, in the past, had automatically been included in commonly held assumptions about Americans. Thernstrom's study of the unskilled laborers in Newburyport, Massachusetts from 1850 - 1880 (Poverty and Progress: Social Mobility in a Nineteenth Century American City, 1850 - 1880) represented the initial effort in cataloguing the experiences of the common man in an urban setting. Thernstrom's use of social science methodology allowed him to discern the geographical and social mobility patterns of Newburyport's laborers. The results from his analysis did a great deal to <b>dispell</b> the myth that the "rags-to-riches" ideology of the nineteenth century was operative in American society for men regardless of their status. Since Thernstrom's study several other communities and their residents have been similarly examined in terms of geographical and social mobility patterns. The results have not always coincided with the Newburyport example. Dean Esslinger, in a study of the immigrant population of South Bend, Indiana from 1850 - 1880, (Immigrants and the City: Ethnicity and Mobility in a Nineteenth-Century Midwestern Community) discovered that significant upward social mobility occurred for this group. The development of South Bend as an industrial center did not block the opportunity for upward occupational and economic mobility among the city's foreign-born residents. I discovered in this dissertation that Muncie's population was very physically unstable, but that general upward social mobility was the reward for those who stayed. Less than one-half of Muncie's residents recorded on the federal census in 1850, 1860, and 1870 remained in Muncie for ten years. For the minority who did remain, however, improved status, both occupationally and economically, was the rule. One's place of birth had minimal affect on his ability to improve his job and economic status in Muncie. Muncie's foreignborn residents were able to enjoy nearly equal social mobility overtime as the native-born segment of the population. The unskilled foreign-born workers were the major exception to this pattern. They were not as successful in improving their status. Of major significance in the mobility studies of individual communities is the increased awareness which is gained of a broader, national perspective on population movement and status over time. More knowledge about the mobility patterns of America's urban dwellers leads to a more accurate determination of the nation's urban development and growth. The placement of Muncie in a broader urban context was one of the major accomplishments {{of this study}}. Direct comparisons were made between Muncie's mobility patterns and those of Newburyport, Massachusetts and South Bend, Indiana.

The {{purpose of the study}} was twofold: (1) To report changes in the 2 ̆ 2 learning opportunities 2 ̆ 2 that were brought about as a r esult of money. (2) To determine if the per pupil expenditure level had any influence on the learning opportunities of pupils in the San Juan School District, as measured by the achievement gains on the California Achievement Test. Three hypotheses were tested, all of which hypothesized that the amount of expenditure per pupil would influence the learning opportunities of students in the San Juan School District. Three school years, 1953, 1958, and 1965, representative of low, transitional, and high expenditure years were selected to compare the achievement gains of pupils. The sample, consisting of 731 pupils from the three different expenditure years, was drawn from the same schools and grades within the district. Prior to this study, the 1950 edition of the California Achievement Test had been given to the 1953 and 1958 groups of students and was also given to the 1965 group of students. For statistical computations, I. Q. scores from the California Test of Mental Maturity were obtained for each student. The research design employed the analysis of covariance to test the significant differences among the group means. The individual comparison between the adjusted means was based on Duncan 2 ̆ 7 s Multiple Range Test. The analysis of covariance produced F values which con firm ed all three of the research hypotheses. Statistical evidence indicates that students who attended the two designated schools in San Juan during the high expenditure school year, 1965, did attain significantly higher achievement scores in reading, arithmetic, language, and total achievement, than did the students who attended the same schools during the low expenditure year, 1953, or the transitional year, 1958. However, there were no significant differences in the achievement gains between the low and transitional expenditure years. The following conclusions were submitted: 1. As additional money became available and provision for learning opportunities changed, educational expenditures increased. 2. As San Juan spent more money on its schools, they generally were able to employ and retain better teachers. The district was able to and did provide more functionally designed and better equipped facilities, instructional materials, and other aids which were helpful in providing better teaching. 3. Money actually purchased professionally trained teachers as evidenced by improvements in the teacher certification, percentage of teachers possessing degrees, teacher turnover, teacher-pupil ratio, annual adoption of competitive salary schedules, and the possible life-time earning capacity of a beginning teacher. 4. This study implies that, other factors being equal, learning opportunities and expenditure levels tend to go together. 5. There is a definite correspondence between school expenditures and learning opportunities when learning opportunities are measured in terms of achievement gains from the California Achievement Test. 6. If the significance and implication of this study is realized and brought to the public 2 ̆ 7 s attention, it will <b>dispell</b> the fallacy that the power of teacher resourcefulness, ingenuity, and good will and dedicated hard work will overcome a meager budget. 7. Often times people are content to be 2 ̆ 2 equal to the average. 2 ̆ 2 In a school system this feeling may be expressed in salaries, numbers,achievement, expenditures, cost per meal, pupil-teacher ratio, etc. However, results from this study indicate that being 2 ̆ 2 equal to the average in school expenditures, 2 ̆ 2 is sometimes misleading and perhaps not much better than being below the average. To illustrate, when San Juan 2 ̆ 7 s average expenditure per pupil was comparable to that of the state of Utah, the students in the district did not attain significantly higher scores on a standardized achievement test than did the students who attended the same schools when San Juan 2 ̆ 7 s average expenditure per pupil was the lowest in the state. On the other hand, when San Juan 2 ̆ 7 s average expenditure far exceeded Utah 2 ̆ 7 s, significant differences in student achievement were prevalent. Therefore, it would seem advisable for school systems throughout the country not to be complacent and satisfied to be an 2 ̆ 2 average spender, 2 ̆ 2 but in the process of spending not to overlook the necessity of planning and development of specific criteria essential to a quality program, which eventually should lead to excellence...|$|E
