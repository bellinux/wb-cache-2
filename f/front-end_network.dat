In FiWi {{access networks}}, energy efficiency issues must be addressed in a comprehensive fashion that takes into account not only wireless front-end but also optical backhaul segments to extend the battery life of wireless devices and allow operators to reduce their OPEX, while not compromising quality of service (QoS). This paper proposes an energy conservation scheme for FiWi networks (ECO-FiWi) that jointly schedules power-saving modes of wireless stations and access points and optical network units to reduce their energy consumption. ECO-FiWi maximizes the overall network performance by leveraging TDMA to synchronize the power-saving modes and incorporate them into the dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) process. A comprehensive energy saving model and an M/G/ 1 queuing-based analysis of downstream and upstream end-to-end frame delays are presented accounting for both backhaul and <b>front-end</b> <b>network</b> segments.

Determining where to geographically place desktop VMs in a globally distributed cloud so as to optimize user-percieved performance is an important and challenging problem.

To help make dynamic decisions about desktop VM placement, we propose a per-user model {{that can be used to}} automatically construct user profiles, and to predict the optimal location for a user’s desktop based on their past and current usage patterns.

However, most of the existing methods focus more on visual information while ignoring the synchronized audio cues. We propose three multimodal deep fusion strategies to maximize the benefits of visual-audio resonance information. The first one explores the impact on cross-modalities feature fusion from low to high order. The second establishes the visual-audio short-term dependency by sharing weights of corresponding <b>front-end</b> <b>networks.</b> The third extends the temporal dependency to long-term through sharing multimodal memory across visual and audio modalities. Extensive experiments have validated the effectiveness of our three cross-modalities fusion strategies on two benchmark datasets, including Microsoft Research Video to Text (MSRVTT) and Microsoft Video Description (MSVD).

At the front-end, we adopt a deep autoencoder (DAE) for enhancing the speech feature parameters, and speech recognition is performed in the back-end using DNN-HMM acoustic models trained on multi-condition data. The system was evaluated through the ASR task in the Reverb Challenge 2014. The DNN-HMM system trained on the multi-condition training set achieved a conspicuously higher word accuracy compared to the MLLR-adapted GMM-HMM system trained on the same data. Furthermore, feature enhancement with the deep autoencoder contributed to the improvement of recognition accuracy especially in the more adverse conditions. While the mapping between reverberant and clean speech in DAE-based dereverberation is conventionally conducted only with the acoustic information, we presume the mapping is also dependent on the phone information. Therefore, we propose a new scheme (pDAE), which augments a phone-class feature to the standard acoustic features as input. Two types of the phone-class feature are investigated. One is the hard recognition result of monophones, {{and the other is}} a soft representation derived from the posterior outputs of monophone DNN. The augmented feature in either type results in a significant improvement (7 – 8 % relative) from the standard DAE.|$|E
40|$|Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) {{attacks have}} become wide-spread on the Internet. They {{continuously}} target retail merchants, financial companies and government institutions, disrupting {{the availability of}} their online resources and causing {{millions of dollars of}} financial losses. Software vulnerabilities and proliferation of malware have helped create a class of application-level DDoS attacks using networks of compromised hosts (botnets). In a botnet-based DDoS attack, an attacker orders large numbers of bots to send seemingly regular HTTP and HTTPS requests to a web server, so as to deplete the server's CPU, disk, or memory capacity. Researchers have proposed client authentication mechanisms, such as CAPTCHA puzzles, to distinguish bot traffic from legitimate client activity and discard bot-originated packets. However, CAPTCHA authentication is vulnerable to denial-of-service and artificial intelligence attacks. This dissertation proposes that clients instead use hardware tokens to authenticate in a federated authentication environment. The federated authentication solution must resist both man-in-the-middle and denial-of-service attacks. The proposed system architecture uses the Kerberos protocol to satisfy both requirements. This work proposes novel extensions to Kerberos to make it more suitable for generic web authentication. A server could verify client credentials and blacklist repeated offenders. Traffic from blacklisted clients, however, still traverses the server's network stack and consumes server resources. This work proposes Sentinel, a dedicated <b>front-end</b> <b>network</b> device that intercepts server-bound traffic, verifies authentication credentials and filters blacklisted traffic before it reaches the server. Using a front-end device also allows transparently deploying hardware acceleration using network co-processors. Network co-processors can discard blacklisted traffic at the hardware level before it wastes front-end host resources. We implement the proposed system architecture by integrating existing software applications and libraries. We validate the system implementation by evaluating its performance under DDoS attacks consisting of floods of HTTP and HTTPS requests...|$|E

The core {{consists of a}} completely digital implementation, except for a simple recon-struction filter and a comparator. It is capable of both generating arbitrary band-limited waveforms (for excitation purposes) and coherently digitizing arbitrary periodic analog waveforms (for DSP-based test and measurement). Several prototypes were fabricated in a triple-metal 3. 3 -V 0. 35 - m CMOS process, and were demonstrated to perform various curve tracing, oscilloscope, and spectrum analysis tasks at a clock rate of 20 MHz (limited by our experimental setup). Designed for 8 bits of quantization, a spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of 65 dB at 500 KHz and 61 dB at Nyquist (20. 001 MHz) was demonstrated using our pro-totypes. High-frequency narrow-band signals (extending into the gigahertz range) have been captured through subsampling {{and the use of}} a high-bandwidth <b>front-end</b> sampling <b>network.</b> Similarly, circuit phenomena that are broadband in nature were measured by using a delayed-clock subsampling mechanism in which the digitizer sample clock is consistently delayed over multiple runs of the periodic test signal.

40|$|Spectral {{efficient}} hybrid Wireless Optical Broadband Access Network (WOBAN) is a favourable architecture {{for next}} generation access network. It is an optimal combination of an optical backhaul and a wireless front-end for an efficient access network. This thesis proposes the WOBAN in two architecture designs: the WOBAN based on transmission of wireless signal as a BaseBand signal Over Fiber (BBOF), and the spectral efficient hybrid WOBAN based on transmission of wireless Multi-Input Multi-Output Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MIMO OFDM) signals over Wavelength Division Multiplexing Passive Optical Network (WDM PON) as a Radio Over Fiber (ROF). Wireless MIMO signals {{which have the}} same carrier frequency cannot propagate over a single optical fiber on the same wavelength, so a novel Optical Single-SideBand Frequency-Translation (OSSBFT) technique is proposed {{to solve this problem}} in the second WOBAN architecture. The OSSB-FT technique is an efficient method since it excludes the crosstalk between different broadband wireless MIMO signals with the same carrier Radio Frequency (RF). Besides, it is a cost-effective technique as one optical source is enough to generate the optical carrier which is reused at the Access Point (AP), and multiple wavelengths for carrying several wireless MIMO signals over the same fiber.

On a transmission medium, a train is a sequence of consecutive packets, spaced within a maximum allowed inter-packet gap and loaded with data for the same transport layer entity. The size of a train is dynamically determined by the amount of data packetized for transmission and by interruptions of urgent data transmitted onto the medium. At data sending and receiving hosts above the medium level, a packet train is handled as one transfer unit for its protocol processing. 	The thesis presents measurement results which provide motivations for the packet train approach. It describes in detail designs for the major packet train mechanism components, both hardware and software. Results of a simulation evaluation of the packet train scheme vs. the traditional non-train scheme indicate that the packet train is a viable approach to improving bulk data transfer throughput under a wide range of system parameters and traffic load conditions. Finally, the thesis discusses extensions needed for the packet train approach to benefit data transfer performance in a WAN environment...|$|R

Mainly realized on radio and fiber technologies, these networks form an hybrid architecture comprising an optical section and a wireless section that provides a feasible paradigm for high bandwidth and ubiquity at new access network areas. In these FiWi scenarios, in particular when multi-radio and multi-channel configurations are used, an effective frequency assignment should be done to radios so that higher throughput and low delay can be obtained and the best of such architectures is achieved. However, traffic conditions may change over time, meaning that radio channel configurations may be outdated and new reconfigurations can be done to improve network performance. To cope with the increasing demand for bandwidth, fiber to the home/premises/building (FTTX) technologies were massively deployed at the back-end. These technologies are characterized by the huge bandwidth capacity and the absence of active devices on the network plant, which is an advantage for power saving. On the other hand, at the <b>front-end,</b> wireless mesh <b>networks</b> (WMN) are expected to provide mobility and converge different wireless technologies to provide high-speed and huge bandwidth connectivity to the end user. In this dissertation, the frequency reassignment problem in the context of FiWi access networks is discussed and a state-of-art on the subject is proposed. Also, two methodologies for frequency reconfiguration planning are proposed along with their mathematical formalization, and are evaluated by simulation. In one of the strategies, NBR, the algorithm prioritizes channel assignment according to the relative position of nodes and their gateways, while in the other, RBR, nodes are processed as their routes toward the gateways are traversed. A discrete event simulation model to evaluate the performance of the proposed frequency reassignment algorithms was developed using OMNeT++ framework. Simulation results showing that RBR is the algorithm that better exploits channel reconfigurations are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Multilevel secure {{database}} management system (MLS/DBMS) products no longer enjoy direct commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) support. Meanwhile, existing users of these MLS/DBMS products continue to rely on them to satisfy their multilevel security requirements. This calls for {{a new approach to}} developing MLS/DBMS systems, one that relies on adapting the features of existing COTS database products rather than depending on the traditional custom design products to provide continuing MLS support. We advocate fragmentation as a good basis for implementing multilevel security in the new approach because it is well supported in some current COTS {{database management}} systems. We implemented a prototype that utilises the inherent advantages of the distribution scheme in distributed databases for controlling access to single-level fragments; this is achieved by augmenting the distribution module of the host distributed DBMS with MLS code such that the clearance of the user making a request is always compared to the classification of the node containing the fragments referenced; requests to unauthorised nodes are simply dropped. The prototype we implemented was used to instrument a series of experiments to determine the relative performance of the tuple, attribute, and element level fragmentation schemes. Our experiments measured the impact on the <b>front-end</b> and the <b>network</b> when various properties of each scheme, such as the number of tuples, attributes, security levels, and the page size, were varied for a Selection and Join query. We were particularly interested in the relationship between performance degradation and changes in the quantity of these properties. The performance of each scheme was measured in terms of its response time. The response times for the element level fragmentation scheme increased as the numbers of tuples, attributes, security levels, and the page size were increased, more significantly so than when the number of tuples and attributes were increased. The response times for the attribute level fragmentation scheme was the fastest, suggesting that the performance of the attribute level scheme is superior to the tuple and element level fragmentation schemes. In the context of assurance, this research has also shown that the distribution of fragments based on security level is a more natural approach to implementing security in MLS/DBMS systems, because a multilevel database is analogous to a distributed database based on security level. Overall, our study finds that the attribute level fragmentation scheme demonstrates better performance than the tuple and element level schemes. The response times (and hence the performance) of the element level fragmentation scheme exhibited the worst performance degradation compared to the tuple and attribute level schemes...|$|R
