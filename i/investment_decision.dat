5|$|Interest rate parity {{rests on}} certain assumptions, the first being that capital is mobile - investors can readily {{exchange}} domestic assets for foreign assets. The second {{assumption is that}} assets have perfect substitutability, following from their similarities in riskiness and liquidity. Given capital mobility and perfect substitutability, investors {{would be expected to}} hold those assets offering greater returns, be they domestic or foreign assets. However, both domestic and foreign assets are held by investors. Therefore, it must be true that no difference can exist between the returns on domestic assets and the returns on foreign assets. That {{is not to say that}} domestic investors and foreign investors will earn equivalent returns, but that a single investor on any given side would expect to earn equivalent returns from either <b>investment</b> <b>decision.</b>|$|E
5|$|The IFC {{established}} IFC Asset Management Company LLC (IFC AMC) in 2009 as {{a wholly}} owned subsidiary to manage all capital funds to {{be invested in}} emerging markets. The AMC manages capital mobilized by the IFC {{as well as by}} third parties such as sovereign or pension funds, and other development financing organizations. Despite being owned by the IFC, the AMC has <b>investment</b> <b>decision</b> autonomy and is charged with a fiduciary responsibility to the four individual funds under its management. It also aims to mobilize additional capital for IFC investments as it can make certain types of investments which the IFC cannot. , the AMC managed the IFC Capitalization Fund (Equity) Fund, L.P., the IFC Capitalization (Subordinated Debt) Fund, L.P., the IFC African, Latin American, and Caribbean Fund, L.P., and the Africa Capitalization Fund, Ltd. The IFC Capitalization (Equity) Fund holds $1.3 billion in equity, while the IFC Capitalization (Subordinated Debt) Fund is valued at $1.7 billion. The IFC African, Latin American, and Caribbean Fund (referred to as the IFC ALAC Fund) was created in 2010 and is worth $1 billion. , the ALAC Fund has invested a total of $349.1 million into twelve businesses. The Africa Capitalization Fund was set up in 2011 to invest in commercial banks in both Northern and Sub-Saharan Africa and its commitments totaled $181.8 million in March 2012. , Gavin E.R.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} capital <b>investment</b> <b>decisions</b> of Korean firms {{and their impact}} on {{shareholder}} wealth. Overall, we find positive abnormal returns surrounding the announcements of 697 cases of investment projects during the period 1992 - 1999. This paper also finds that the <b>investment</b> <b>decisions</b> of business group ("chaebol"-affiliated) firms do not increase shareholder wealth, while the capital <b>investment</b> <b>decisions</b> of non-"chaebol" firms generate significantly positive abnormal returns. The multivariate tests provide consistent evidence that the announcement effects for "chaebol" firms are lower than for non-"chaebol" firms, after growth opportunities, investment size and firm size are controlled for.

25|$|As a tool {{applied to}} making an <b>investment</b> <b>decision,</b> {{to decide whether}} a project adds value or not, {{comparing}} the IRR of a single project with the required rate of return, in isolation from any other projects, {{is equivalent to the}} NPV method. If the appropriate IRR (if such can be found correctly) is greater than the required rate of return, then using the required rate of return to discount cash flows to their present value, the NPV of that project will be positive, and vice versa. However, using IRR to sort projects in order of preference does not result in the same order as using NPV.|$|E
25|$|LNG is most cost {{efficiently}} {{produced in}} relatively large facilities due to economies of scale, at sites with marine access allowing regular large bulk shipments direct to market. This requires a secure gas supply of sufficient capacity. Ideally, facilities are located {{close to the}} gas source, to minimize the cost of intermediate transport infrastructure and gas shrinkage (fuel loss in transport). The high cost of building large LNG facilities makes the progressive development of gas sources to maximize facility utilization essential, and the life extension of existing, financially depreciated LNG facilities cost effective. Particularly when combined with lower sale prices due to large installed capacity and rising construction costs, this makes the economic screening/ justification to develop new, and especially greenfield, LNG facilities challenging, even if these could be more environmentally friendly than existing facilities with all stakeholder concerns satisfied. Due to high financial risk, it is usual to contractually secure gas supply/ concessions and gas sales for extended periods before proceeding to an <b>investment</b> <b>decision.</b>|$|E

On 18 November 2004, the air force received the necessary concessions from the ministry to establish a civilian section. The concession contained a limit of 750,000 passengers per year, and had a duration of 10 years. It also required the airport to be open from 07h to 23h every day and permit general aviation. Negotiations between the air force and Rygge Sivile Lufthavn started in June 2005 to establish an agreement regarding operations and financing. In September, the air force and the company came to an agreement regarding the company's compensation to the military. The agreement was approved by the Ministry of Defence in January 2006.
