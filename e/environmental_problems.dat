5|$|Environmental {{sociology}} is {{the study}} of human interactions with the natural environment, typically emphasizing human dimensions of <b>environmental</b> <b>problems,</b> social impacts of those problems, and efforts to resolve them. As with other sub-fields of sociology, scholarship in environmental sociology may be at one or multiple levels of analysis, from global (e.g. world-systems) to local, societal to individual. Attention is paid also to the processes by which <b>environmental</b> <b>problems</b> become defined and known to humans. As argued by notable environmental sociologist John Bellamy Foster, the predecessor to modern environmental sociology is Marx's analysis of the metabolic rift, which influenced contemporary thought on sustainability. Environmental sociology is often interdisciplinary and overlaps with the sociology of risk, rural sociology and the sociology of disaster.|$|E

5|$|Seabirds (also {{known as}} marine birds) are birds that are adapted to life within the marine environment. While seabirds vary greatly in lifestyle, {{behaviour}} and physiology, they often exhibit striking convergent evolution, {{as the same}} <b>environmental</b> <b>problems</b> and feeding niches have resulted in similar adaptations. The first seabirds evolved in the Cretaceous period, and modern seabird families emerged in the Paleogene.|$|E
40|$|Solving one <b>environmental</b> <b>problem</b> {{may often}} invoke or intensify another one. Such <b>environmental</b> <b>problem</b> {{shifting}} (EPS) is a neglected topic in global sustainability research. Indeed, {{it is difficult}} to study as it requires the merging of insights from various research areas. Here we identify relevant studies, and provide an illustration and guidelines for the systematic study of EPS. As a modest thought experiment to illustrate the relevance of EPS, we consider solutions to scarcity of energy resources and climate change that, due to their extreme nature, may lead to considerable <b>environmental</b> <b>problem</b> shifting. We qualitatively assess the likely environmental and socioeconomic impacts of three hypothetical energy futures to highlight the possibility that as we resolve one <b>environmental</b> <b>problem,</b> another may be aggravated. We further present a set of guidelines to study EPS in a systematic and focused way. Here we stress that shifting can be mediated by biophysical as well as socioeconomic mechanisms, which means that its analysis requires a genuine interdisciplinary effort. </p...|$|R

5|$|Food is {{essential}} to life. Feeding more than seven billion human bodies takes a heavy toll on the Earth's resources. This begins with the appropriation of about 38% of the Earth's land surface and about 20% of its net primary productivity. Added to this are the resource-hungry activities of industrial agribusiness—everything from the crop need for irrigation water, synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to the resource costs of food packaging, transport (now {{a major part of}} global trade) and retail. <b>Environmental</b> <b>problems</b> associated with industrial agriculture and agribusiness are now being addressed through such movements as sustainable agriculture, organic farming and more sustainable business practices.|$|E

40|$|Departing from {{standard}} applications of utility theory where only outcomes matter, we investigate whether past states {{of an environmental}} medium (lost state versus net gain) and alternative causes (human cause versus natural cause) of an <b>environmental</b> <b>problem</b> affect respondents’ interest in and willingness-to-pay to improve it. We use a quasi-experimental survey over {{a random sample of}} citizens in a small region of France. Respondents stated their perceived value of solving an <b>environmental</b> <b>problem</b> related to soil degradation. We find that respondents’ interest is somewhat affected by the combination of past states and alternative causes whereas results on stated willingness-to-pay are inconclusive.

5|$|Harveys Lake {{has been}} the subject of {{scientific}} studies since the late 1940s, when C. B. Reif conducted limnological studies on it. By the 1960s, Harveys Lake began to develop <b>environmental</b> <b>problems.</b> It was the subject of a number of studies in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These studies indicated that the lake was eutrophic. Algae blooms caused it to be closed to swimming in 1981 and 1990. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection completed a phosphorus TMDL for the lake in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Harveys Lake was accidentally {{discovered}} by Benjamin Harvey in 1781. The first settlers {{arrived at the}} lake in the 1790s and 1800s. Early industries in the area included lumbering and farming, but it became well known as a summer resort {{in the latter part}} of the 1800s and into the 1900s. It was also used as a water supply in the early 1900s. However, the lake began to develop significant <b>environmental</b> <b>problems</b> in the 1960s and a total maximum daily load was created for it in 1994. Since 1968, the lake has been located in the borough of Harveys Lake.|$|E

Remaining issues included lead contamination, unexploded munitions, and stockpiles of depleted uranium. Though Moscoso fired all of Pérez Balladares' appointments from the Panama Canal Authority and appointed supermarket magnate (and future president) Ricardo Martinelli as its head, the Authority retained its autonomy from her administration.

5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{debate about whether}} the Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate is correct, and of {{the relevance of the}} Jevons paradox to energy conservation policy. Most governments, environmentalists and NGOs pursue policies that improve efficiency, holding that it will lower resource consumption and reduce <b>environmental</b> <b>problems.</b> Others, including many environmental economists, doubt this 'efficiency strategy' towards sustainability, and worry that efficiency gains may in fact lead to higher production and consumption. They hold that for resource use to fall, efficiency gains should be coupled with other policies that limit resource use.|$|E
5|$|Waste {{management}} including sewage treatment, the linked {{processes of}} deforestation and soil degradation, {{and climate change}} or global warming are the major <b>environmental</b> <b>problems</b> in Nigeria. Waste management presents problems in a mega city like Lagos and other major Nigerian cities which are linked with economic development, population growth and the inability of municipal councils to manage the resulting rise in industrial and domestic waste. This huge waste management problem is also attributable to unsustainable environmental management lifestyles of Kubwa Community in the Federal Capital Territory, where there are habits of indiscriminate disposal of waste, dumping of waste along or into the canals, sewerage systems that are channels for water flows, etc.|$|E

40|$|In a {{previous}} article about {{life cycle assessment}} (LCA), a methodological framework was proposed and two components of this framework were discussed in more detail: the goal definition and the inventory. In this second article, the other components of the framework are discussed in detail: the classification, the valuation and the improvement analysis. In the classification, resource extractions and emissions associated with {{the life cycle of}} a product are translated into contributions to a number of <b>environmental</b> <b>problem</b> types, such as resource depletion, global warming, ozone depletion, acidification, etc. For this, each extraction and emission is multiplied with a so-called classification factor and the multiplication results are aggregated per problem type. Classification factors are proposed for a number of <b>environmental</b> <b>problem</b> types. The valuation includes both a valuation of the different <b>environmental</b> <b>problem</b> types and an assessment of {{the reliability and validity of}} the results. For the valuation of the <b>environmental</b> <b>problem</b> types, qualitative or quantitative multicriterion analysis could be applied. Given a standard list of weighting factors the quantitative multicriterion analysis seems preferable, because of its low costs and its simplicity.
