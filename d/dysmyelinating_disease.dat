The molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity of mutant PLP are however currently unknown. We report here that PMD-linked mutations of PLP are associated with the accelerated assembly of the protein into stable homooligomers that resemble mature, native PLP. Thus although WT PLP forms stable oligomers after an extended maturation period, most likely at the cell surface, mutant forms of PLP rapidly assemble into such oligomers at the ER. Using PLP mutants associated with diseases of varying severity, we show that the formation of stable oligomers correlates with the development of PMD. Based on these findings, we propose that the premature oligomerization of PLP in the ER of oligodendrocytes contributes to the pathology of PMD...|$|E

This enzyme {{is involved in}} the biosynthesis pathways of some fatty acids, phytanic acid, and leukotrienes. The main features of the disease are its association with congenital ichthyosis, mental retardation, and spastic tetraplegia. Methods. We report on the diagnostic and therapeutic management of 2 cases of SLS. Results. The diagnosis of SLS was suspected in the first patient at 2 years of age before the clinical triad appeared and confirmed at 4 years of age by the culture of fibroblasts and the peak of lipids on 1. 3 ppm spectroscopy. After 3 months of treatment with zileuton, an inhibitor of leukotriene synthesis, moderate clinical efficacy for pruritus and ichthyosis was observed. The second patient was diagnosed at 1 year of age with the association of psychomotor retardation and congenital ichthyosis, in accordance with acute Guillain-Barre syndrome. Diagnosis was confirmed with enzymology, and cerebral spectro-MRI featured an abnormal lipidic peak. Zileuton therapy was initiated at the time of diagnosis and was effective for pruritus after 6 months of treatment. Conclusion.

40|$|Taiep is an {{autosomal}} recessive mutant rat {{that shows a}} highly hypomyelinated central nervous system (CNS). Oligodendrocytes accumulate microtubules (MTs) in association with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes forming MT-ER complexes. The microtubular defect in oligodendrocytes, the abnormal formation of CNS myelin and the astrocytic reaction were characterized by immunocytochemical and ultrastructural methods {{during the first year}} of life. Optic nerves of both control and taiep rats were processed by the immunoperoxidase method using antibodies against tubulin, myelin basic protein (MBP) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Taiep oligodendrocytes are strongly immunoreactive against tubulin, indicative of a significant accumulation of microtubules. Early differentiated oligodendrocytes observed with electron microscopy show that MT-ER complexes are mainly present in the cell body. This defect increases {{during the first year of}} life; oligodendrocytes show large MT-ER complexes projected within oligodendrocyte processes. Using anti-MBP, there was a progressive reduction of immunolabeling in the myelin sheaths as taiep rats grew older. Ultrastructural analysis revealed severely dysmyelinated axons with a frequently collapsed periaxonal collar. However, through age the myelin sheath became gradually infiltrated by MTs, suggesting their contribution to premature loss of myelin in the taiep rat. Axons of one-year-old taiep rats were severely demyelinated. Modifications in astrocytes revealed by the GFAP antibody showed a strong hypertrophy with increased immunostaining in their processes. As demyelination of axons progressed, taiep rats developed a strong astrogliosis. The present findings suggest that in taiep rats the early abnormal myelination of axons affects the adequate maintenance of myelin, leading to a progressive loss of myelin components and severe astrogliosis, features that should be considered in the pathogenesis of <b>dysmyelinating</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|E

In md rat spinal cord, CG 4 oligodendrocyte progenitors migrated up to 7 mm along the dorsal columns, where they divided and myelinated numerous axons 2 weeks after grafting. CG 4 cells were transfected with the bacterial lacZ gene and selected for high beta-galactosidase expression. The cell migration and fate of these LacZ+ cells were analyzed after transplantation.

The molecular pathology has been generally attributed to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention of misfolded proteolipid protein (PLP) (and its splice isoform DM 20) and induction of the unfolded protein response. As opposed to previous studies of heterologous expression systems, we have analyzed PLP/DM 20 trafficking in oligodendroglial cells, thereby revealing differences between PMD and SPG- 2 -associated PLP/DM 20 isoforms. PLPA 242 V and DM 20 (A 242 V) (jimpy-msd in mice), associated with severe PMD-like phenotype in vivo, were not only retained in the ER but also interfered with oligodendroglial process formation. In contrast, glial cells expressing SPG- 2 -associated PLPI 186 T or DM 20 (I 186 T) (rumpshaker in mice) developed processes, and mutant PLP/DM 20 reached a late endosomal/lysosomal compartment. Unexpectedly, PLP/DM 20 with either substitution exhibited impaired cholesterol binding, and the association with lipid raft microdomains was strongly reduced. Turnover analysis demonstrated that mutant PLP was rapidly degraded in oligodendroglial cells, with half-lives for PLP > PLPI 186 T > PLPA 242 V. Protein degradation was specifically sensitive to proteasome inhibition, although PLP/DM 20 (I 186 T) degradation was also affected by inhibition of lysosomal enzymes. We conclude that, in addition to ER retention and unfolded protein response (UPR) induction, impaired cholesterol binding and lipid raft association are characteristic cellular defects of PLP 1 -missense mutations. Mutant protein is rapidly cleared and does not accumulate in oligodendroglial cells. Whereas UPR-induced cell death governs the PMD phenotype of the msd mutation, we propose that impaired cholesterol and lipid raft interaction of the rsh protein may contribute to the dysmyelination observed in SPG- 2...|$|R

To address this issue, we examined the cellular response to missense mutants of PLP that are associated with distinct disease phenotypes. We found that the mild-disease-associated mutants, W 162 L and G 245 A, were cleared from the ER comparatively quickly via proteasomal degradation and/or ER exit. By contrast, the more `aggressive' A 242 V mutant, which causes severe disease, was significantly more stable, accumulated at the ER and resulted in a specific activation of the UPR.

40|$|Myelin ist eine um Nervenaxone gewundene, spezialisierte Membran, die durch ihre isolierende Eigenschaft die Nervenleitungsgeschwindigkeit beschleunigt. Oligodendrozyten bilden das Myelin im ZNS und gehören zu den metabolisch aktivsten Zellen des menschlichen Körpers. Sie erzeugen in den ersten Lebenswochen große Mengen an Myelinmembran, wozu ausgefeilte Protein- und Lipidsortierungsmechanismen erforderlich sind. Obwohl die Struktur und die Zusammensetzung von Myelin schon seit langem bekannt sind, weiß man wenig über die molekularen Mechanismen der Myelingenese. In dieser Arbeit wurden für die Myelinsortierung wichtige Interaktionen des Myelinhauptproteins Proteolipid-Protein (PLP) näher untersucht. PLP geht eine Protein-Lipid-Interaktion mit Detergens-unlöslichen Membranfraktionen (DRM; 'Myelinrafts') ein. Analog zu anderen polaren Zellen wird angenommen, dass Oligodendrozyten diese DRM's als Sortierungsweg für Proteine in die Myelinmembrandomäne verwenden. Bekannt ist nicht, wie die Assoziation von PLP mit 'Myelinrafts' zustande kommt. Die Struktur von PLP weist mit seinen Palmitoylierungen jedoch ein gut erforschtes Signal für die Zuordnung zu DRM's auf. Um den Einfluss der Palmitoylierungen zu prüfen, wurden für dieses Projekt zunächst mehrere unterschiedlich mutierte PLP-Konstrukte hergestellt, die weniger bzw. nicht mehr palmitoyliert werden und anschließend deren Anteil in 'Myelinrafts' bestimmt. Ein wichtiges Ergebnis war, dass die Palmitoylierung die Assoziation von PLP mit 'Myelinrafts' nicht verändert. Ferner wurde untersucht, ob Protein-Interaktionen Einfluss auf die Sortierung von PLP nehmen. Es konnte hier nun gezeigt werden, dass PLP mit Myelin-Oligodendrozyten-Glykoprotein (MOG), Komplexe bildet, welche sich hauptsächlich in Aktin/a-Aktinin-reichen Membrandomänen an der Zelloberfläche befinden. MOG erhöht den Anteil an PLP in diesen Domänen. Vor allem aber wird MOG von mutiertem PLP (PLPmsd und PLPrsh) im Endoplasmatischen Retikulum (ER) zurückgehalten. PLPmsd und PLPrsh werden wegen ihrer falschen Struktur nicht aus dem ER transportiert und lösen u. a. die Pelizäus-Merzbacher-Krankheit aus. Die Ergebnisse dieser Arbeit können somit zum weiteren Verständnis der Myelinerkrankungen beitragen. Specialized glial cells, oligodendrocytes and Schwann-cells, {{synthesize}} myelin as a multilamellar, compact membrane that ensheathes and insulates axons. During myelinogenesis myelin producing {{cells are}} the cells {{with the highest}} rate of metabolic activity in the human body synthesizing a vast amount of proteins and lipids. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms how the different molecules are sorted to the myelin membrane. The major myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) interacts with cholesterol and galactosylceramide enriched membrane domains in primary cultures of oligodendrocytes. These membrane domains represent a specialized form of lipid rafts, termed myelin rafts, which are characterized by their insolubility in the zwitterionic detergent 3 -[(3 -cholamidopropyl) -dimethylammonio]- 1 -propanesulfonate (CHAPS). These protein-lipid interactions are assumed to be critical for targeting PLP to the myelin membrane. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the sorting determinant for association with the CHAPS-insoluble membrane fraction and for the targeting to the myelin membrane. Since PLP is palmitoylated at several sites, we tested the hypothesis that this particular post-translational lipid modification, may act as a sorting determinant by enhancing the affinity of PLP to the myelin membrane. We found that palmitoylation-deficient mutants of PLP/DM 20, were less efficiently targeted to myelin membrane in primary cultures of oligodenrocytes. However, their association to the CHAPS-insoluble membrane fraction was not affected. We also addressed the question whether protein-protein interactions contribute to the proper sorting of PLP. By co-immunopreciptiation experiments we found that PLP forms a complex with the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), and by immunoflourescence microscopy we found both proteins co-localized with actin/a-actinin on the cell surface in large membrane patches. Expression of MOG increased the targeting and/or retention of PLP in these actin-rich surface patches. We also co-expressed MOG with mutant forms of PLP that are associated with the severe <b>dysmyelinating</b> Pelizaeus-Merzbacher <b>disease</b> and are known to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Now we found that MOG was trapped with the mutant of PLP in the ER demonstrating that the transport of MOG and PLP are closely coupled.

To understand the cellular response to overexpressed PLP in PMD, we have overexpressed PLP in BHK cells and primary cultures of oligodendrocytes with the Semliki Forest virus expression system. Overexpressed PLP was routed to late endosomes/lysosomes and caused a sequestration of cholesterol in these compartments. Similar results were seen in transgenic mice overexpressing PLP.

In addition, two fluorescent sphingolipids, BODIPY–lactosylceramide and –galactosylceramide, which under normal conditions are sorted to the Golgi apparatus, were missorted to perinuclear structures.

A {{deeper understanding of the}} molecular basis of myelination and, specifically, of the transport of myelin proteins, will contribute to the search of the aetiology of many <b>dysmyelinating</b> and demyelinating <b>diseases,</b> including multiple sclerosis. Recent investigations suggest that proteolipid protein (PLP), the major myelin protein, could reach myelin sheath by an indirect transport pathway, that is, a transcytotic route via the plasma membrane of the cell body. If PLP transport relies on a transcytotic process, it is reasonable to consider that this myelin protein could be associated with MAL 2, a raft protein essential for transcytosis. In this study, carried out with the human oligodendrocytic cell line HOG, we show that PLP colocalized with green fluorescent protein (GFP) -MAL 2 after internalization from the plasma membrane. In addition, both immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays, indicated the existence of an interaction between GFP-MAL 2 and PLP. Finally, ultrastructural studies demonstrated colocalization of GFP-MAL 2 and PLP in vesicles and tubulovesicular structures. Taken together, these results prove {{for the first time the}} interaction of PLP and MAL 2 in oligodendrocytic cells, supporting the transcytotic mode...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{mutations}} that severely {{diminish the}} activity of aspartoacylase (ASPA) result in the fatal brain <b>dysmyelinating</b> disorder, Canavan <b>disease.</b> There is no effective treatment. ASPA produces free acetate from the concentrated brain metabolite, N-acetylaspartate (NAA). Because acetyl coenzyme A is a key building block for lipid synthesis, we postulated that the inability to catabolize NAA leads to a brain acetate deficiency during a critical period of CNS development, impairing myelination and possibly other aspects of brain development. We tested the hypothesis that acetate supplementation during postnatal myelination would ameliorate the severe phenotype associated with ASPA deficiency using the tremor rat model of Canavan disease. Glyceryltriacetate (GTA) was administered orally to tremor rats starting 7  days after birth, and was continued in food and water after weaning. Motor function, myelin lipids, and brain vacuolation were analyzed in GTA-treated and untreated tremor rats. Significant improvements were observed in motor performance and myelin galactocerebroside content in tremor rats treated with GTA. Further, brain vacuolation was modestly reduced, and these reductions were positively correlated with improved motor performance. We also examined {{the expression of the}} acetyl coenzyme A synthesizing enzyme acetyl coenzyme A synthase 1 and found upregulation of expression in tremor rats, with a return to near normal expression levels in GTA-treated tremor rats. These results confirm the critical role played by NAA-derived acetate in brain myelination and development, and demonstrate the potential usefulness of acetate therapy for the treatment of Canavan disease...|$|R
