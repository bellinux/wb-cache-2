500|$|A. J. A. Nelson, {{who succeeded}} Eberle as {{director}} of the adult education program, recalled in 1987 the conversation he had with Madgwick when Nelson arrived at the university in 1955. Said Madgwick to Nelson, [...] "I see your job as the most important in the University. It is the one <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> if I were not Vice-Chancellor. The future of the whole University will depend on how well you do it." ...|$|E
500|$|A washed-up former pilot {{called out}} of {{retirement}} by the Pan Pacific Defense Corps. On casting Hunnam, del Toro stated: [...] "I saw him and I thought he had an earnest, really honest nature. And {{he was the kind}} of guy that I can relate to, as a male audience member I go, 'I like that guy. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a few beers with that guy' … he has an earthy quality." [...] Describing the character, Hunnam stated: [...] "When you meet me, in the beginning of the story, I've suffered a giant loss. Not only has it killed my sense of self-worth, but also my will to fight and keep on going. And then, Rinko and Idris, and a couple other people, bring me {{out of retirement}} to try to help with this grand push. I think that journey is a very relatable one. Everybody, at some point in their life, has fallen down and not felt like getting back up, but you have to, no matter how difficult it is." [...] Hunnam was also considered for the role of Prince Nuada in del Toro's previous film, [...] Paul Michael Wyers plays Raleigh as a child.|$|E
2500|$|Schuldiner {{also stated}} that he was pro-choice. He {{is quoted as saying}} that [...] "it should be legal. If I was a woman surely <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a choice to have a child or not. In U.S. lot of new-borns are killed because they were unwanted. It is better to solve it {{immediately}} when a woman finds out about the pregnancy and she doesn't want a child. Better to go for an abortion than to kill a baby. That is terrible. Men cannot force women to keep a child when they themselves feel they can't." ...|$|E

2500|$|In-flight {{director}} John Ferruggio recalled, [...] "We {{were ready}} for take off in Amsterdam, and the aircraft {{came to an abrupt}} stop {{in the middle of the}} runway. And Captain Priddy called me up into the cockpit and says, 'I'd like to have a word with you.' I went up to the cockpit, and he says, 'We have two passengers by the name of Diop and Gueye.' He says, 'Go down and try to find them in the manifest, because <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a word with them.' ... So Captain Priddy sat them down at these two seats over here. He gave them a pretty good pat. They had a Styrofoam container in their groin area where they carried the grenade, and the 25-mm pistols. But this we found out much later." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} March 2014, U.S. {{president}} Obama {{ruled out}} any Western military intervention in Ukraine and admitted that Russia's annexation of Crimea {{would be hard to}} reverse; however, he dismissed Russia as a [...] "regional power" [...] that did not pose a major security threat to the U.S. In January 2016, when asked for his opinion of Obama's statement, Putin said, [...] "I think that speculations about other countries, an attempt to speak disrespectfully about other countries is an attempt to prove one's exceptionalism by contrast. In my view, that is a misguided position." [...] In November 2016, the president of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker said this of the statement of Obama: [...] "We have a lot to learn about the depths of Russia, we are very ignorant about it at the moment. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> discussions on a level footing with Russia.
