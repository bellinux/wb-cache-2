5|$|A {{country with}} a large trade surplus would {{generally}} see {{the value of its}} currency appreciate relative to other currencies, which would reduce the imbalance as the relative price of its exports increases. This currency appreciation occurs as the importing country sells its currency to buy the exporting country's currency used to purchase the goods. Alternatively, trade imbalances can be reduced if a country encouraged domestic saving by restricting or penalising the flow of capital across borders, or by raising interest rates, although this benefit is likely offset by slowing down the economy and increasing government <b>interest</b> <b>payments.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1927 {{economic}} indicators were signalling {{the onset of}} a recession in Australia. By 1929, the evidence was unavoidable that recession was becoming depression as a resulting of rapidly deteriorating international conditions. In that year, prices for Australian exports fell by nearly a third and GDP had fallen by 10%, with no attendant fall {{in the cost of}} living. Australia's debt now stood at £631 million the <b>interest</b> <b>payments</b> on which were equivalent to nearly half of Australia's export receipts, a situation difficult to sustain even in a positive economic climate. Investors and banks recognised the risk and Australia's credit access was rapidly drying up. Bruce's grand economic development plans had increased the national debt significantly yet had delivered only marginal economic expansion in the short term.|$|E

40|$|The cost of <b>interest</b> <b>payment</b> {{guarantees}} {{is difficult}} to evaluate because guarantees are a contingent obligation that become effective only if a certain condition is met (that is, the debtor fails to make a certain payment). In this paper a technique to value <b>interest</b> <b>payment</b> guarantees on developing country debt is developed and preliminary estimates are presented. Using results from option pricing theory, the market price that an <b>interest</b> <b>payment</b> guarantee would have if it were traded in financial markets is estimated from the characteristics of secondary market prices of developing country debt. ...|$|R
50|$|This type of tranche {{supports}} other tranches by {{not receiving}} an <b>interest</b> <b>payment.</b> The <b>interest</b> <b>payment</b> {{that would have}} accrued to the Z tranche is used {{to pay off the}} principal of other bonds, and the principal of the Z tranche increases. The Z tranche starts receiving <b>interest</b> and principal <b>payments</b> only after the other tranches in the CMO have been fully paid. This type of tranche is often used to customize sequential tranches, or VADM tranches.|$|R
5|$|The {{levelized cost}} of {{electricity}} (LCoE) can be calculated by dividing the total cost to build and operate a power-generating system over its lifetime by {{the total amount of}} electricity shipped to the grid during that period. The amount of money is essentially a combination of the capital expense (CAPEX) of the plant and the <b>interest</b> <b>payments</b> on that CAPEX, and the discounted cost of the fuel, the maintenance needed to keep it running and its dismantling, the discounted operational expenses, or OPEX. The amount of power is normally calculated by considering the peak power the plant could produce, and then adjusting that by the capacity factor (CF) to account for downtime due to maintenance or deliberate throttling. As a quick calculation, one can ignore inflation, opportunity costs and minor operational expenses to develop a figure of merit for the {{cost of electricity}}.|$|E
5|$|The shares debuted on the NYSE on 10 August 2012, and {{initially}} showed a slight rise to $14.05 per share, but closed the day {{back at the}} offer price of $14 each, valuing the club as a whole at $2.3billion, and {{making it one of}} the most valuable sports teams in the world. One of the biggest investors in the IPO was American billionaire George Soros, whose investment company purchased about 3.1million class A shares (1.9% of the club), valued at $40.7million (£25.8million) at the time. Club records announced in November 2012 revealed that gross debt had fallen to £359.7million after the share sale paid off £62.6million of bonds. The club's debts were further remedied in May 2013, after a new loan deal was agreed that would save the club £10million a year in <b>interest</b> <b>payments</b> on debts now totalling around £307million.|$|E
5|$|There were {{assertions that}} Odex had charged 10% {{interest}} for settlements paid through an instalment plan, but {{a press release}} by the company denied that it had required any such <b>interest</b> <b>payments.</b> By September 2007, 105 out of the 300 SingNet subscribers who had received letters had negotiated with and paid Odex, although, in a news conference, Odex said that it had neither forced payment from nor fined anyone. The company explained {{that it would not}} profit from the enforcement process and intended to donate to charity any excess amount received. It would also release a financial audit of all the money collected at the close of proceedings. On 31 August 2007, in an attempt to address criticisms of late releases, Odex began to offer video on demand (VOD) on its relaunched website.

5|$|Most of {{the capital}} used by Glazer to {{purchase}} Manchester United {{came in the form}} of loans, the majority of which were secured against the club's assets, incurring <b>interest</b> <b>payments</b> of over £60million per annum. The remainder {{came in the form of}} PIK loans (payment in kind loans), which were later sold to hedge funds. Manchester United was not liable for the PIKs, which were held by Red Football Joint Venture and were secured on that company's shares in Red Football (and thus the club). The interest on the PIKs rolled up at 14.25% per annum. Despite this, the Glazers did not pay down any of the PIK loans in the first five years they owned the club. In January 2010, the club carried out a successful £500million bond issue, and by March 2010, the PIKs stood at around £207million. The PIKs were eventually paid off in November 2010 by unspecified means. In August 2012, as part of further refinancing, the Glazers sold a number of shares in Manchester United in an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).|$|E
5|$|Yerkes {{also did}} not {{live to see the}} UERL's {{financial}} struggle during the first years after the opening of the new lines. Because of greatly over-optimistic pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers, the lines failed to generate the income expected and needed to fund the <b>interest</b> <b>payments</b> on the UERL's substantial borrowings. In the Bakerloo Tube's first twelve months of operation, it carried 20.5million passengers, less than sixty per cent of the 35million that had been predicted during the planning of the line. The Piccadilly Tube achieved 26million of a predicted 60million and the Hampstead Tube managed 25million of a predicted 50million. For the DR, the UERL had predicted an increase to 100million passengers after electrification, but achieved 55million. The lower than expected passenger numbers were partly due to competition between the UERL's lines and those of the other tube and sub-surface railway companies, and the further spread of electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, took a large number of passengers away from the trains. The low price of tickets also depressed income.|$|E
5|$|The {{money was}} used to {{complete}} the line to Nantwich, and to build a reservoir at Bunbury Heath. The work was completed in August 1779, and the company hoped to raise enough money to then build the line to Middlewich. They proposed building it with narrow locks, to reduce the cost, but the shareholders were not prepared to support them; instead they concentrated on trying to generate traffic on the line that had been built. They attempted to mine salt at Nantwich, but failed to find any, and tried running boats on the Trent and Mersey, from which goods were carried over land to Nantwich, for onward carriage to Liverpool. They also ran boats for cargo and passengers on the canal itself. By the end of 1781, the company had no money {{and was unable to}} meet <b>interest</b> <b>payments</b> on the loans. They decided to forfeit the canal to Egerton, the main mortgagee, but he did not respond to their offer. Angry landowners who had not been paid drained Bunbury reservoir in March 1782, but somehow the committee managed to keep the canal open, by selling boats and land. Disaster struck in November 1787, when Beeston Staircase Locks collapsed, and there was no money to fund repairs.|$|E

50|$|For other bonds, {{such as in}} {{the case}} of TIPS, the {{underlying}} principal of the bond changes, which results in a higher <b>interest</b> <b>payment</b> when multiplied by the same rate. For example, if the annual coupon of the bond were 5% and the underlying principal of the bond were 100 units, the annual payment would be 5 units. If the inflation index increased by 10%, the principal of the bond would increase to 110 units. The coupon rate would remain at 5%, resulting in an <b>interest</b> <b>payment</b> of 110 x 5% = 5.5 units.|$|R
30|$|To further {{explain the}} {{occurring}} effects, we use x_ 2 p {{from above and}} x_ 2 r:={x|D_c 2 (x)-λ>λ r_f} that distinguishes between the cases where the corporation’s <b>interest</b> <b>payment</b> is greater or smaller than the partnership’s. If x_ 2 r<x<x_ 2 u, the corporation’s additional tax payment exceeds the partnership’s due to the higher <b>interest</b> <b>payment,</b> as illustrated in Fig. 2. This risk premium effect discriminates against the corporation. If x<x_ 2 r, the corporation’s additional tax payment falls below the partnership’s, and it is even zero for x<x_ 2 l. This default effect, which privileges the corporation, {{is driven by the}} fact that the partnership is mostly hit by the IDR when cash flows are below the default threshold and the investors have to stand in for the <b>interest</b> <b>payment.</b> The magnitude of both effects and, therefore, the total impact of the IDR on the choice of organizational form depends on the distribution of the gross return x.|$|R

25|$|On the {{expenditures}} side, strong expenditure {{growth has}} remained a main feature of the budget.
