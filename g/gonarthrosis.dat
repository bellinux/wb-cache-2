40|$|Aim: Analysis of {{arthroscopy}} {{importance of}} knee joints for characteristics of stage of cartilage destruction and synovitis in <b>gonarthrosis</b> cases. Material and methods: Arthroscopical study included 24 <b>gonarthrosis</b> pts (I-III degree by A. Larsen) by "STORZ ” apparatus with photoinstrumental set. Six basic zones of knee joint were analyzed: patella, trochlear are, a lateral and medial articular tibial and femoral surfaces. Criteria of assessment included presence {{and distribution of}} cartilage damage according to 5 degrees: normal cartilage (0), fibrillar cartilage (I degree), surface fissures and/or surface erosions (2 degree), deep cartilage tissures and/or erosions baring subchondral bone (3 degree), baring subchondral bone (4 degree). Synovitis intensity was analyzed by three degrees: low, moderate or high. Results: It was determined that in different zones of knee joint the character and depth of cartilage destruction is not the same. In 100 % of patients with <b>gonarthrosis</b> independently of radiological stage there were changes in patellar cartilage. Pathology' of articular cartilage {{in the area of}} lateral condyle of the femur in the lateral and medial areas of the tibia was found in the I-st, Il-nd and Ill-d stages with the same incidence. Development of fissures of cartilage was found in all <b>gonarthrosis</b> stages and even in the 1 -st stage the incidence was the same as in the 111 -d disease degree. Erosions were found in more than a half of pts with the I-st and Il- nd stages of <b>gonarthrosis</b> (57 % and 67 % correspondingly). Even in the I-st <b>gonarthrosis</b> stage in all areas of knee joint excluding lateral articular surface of the tibia changes characteristic for the Ill-d degree of cartilage destruction were found with different frequency. Incidence of subclinical synovitis according to arthroscopy data in the /, 11, III radiological stages of <b>gonarthrosis</b> was 57 %, 33. 5 % and 100 % correspondingly. Fissures and erosions were found in all pts with expressed synovitis. Conclusion: In our study no correlation was found between the stage of cartilage destruction (according to arthroscopy data) and early (1 and 11) radiological <b>gonarthrosis</b> stages: Ill-d stage of <b>gonarthrosis</b> is corresponding with the Ill-d stage of cartilage destruction...|$|E

It is established that people at the age of 40 to 65, suffering with <b>gonarthrosis</b> have authentically more angular moments of lateral mode of motions and rotations in knee joints. Conclusion. Under analysis of the kinematics of knee joints, between the control and the experimental groups were fixed significant differences (t-test, p < 0, 01). Besides there were fixed differences between dominant and non-dominant limbs, which mean that the force of muscles of lower limbs can also be a modificative factor, which influences on the strain in joints that potentially can lead to the development and/or advance of degenerative damage in the knee joint.  </p...|$|E
40|$|Ahlbäck's {{classification}} of <b>gonarthrosis</b> {{can be applied}} with improved precision by careful interpretation of anteroposterior varus stress and lateral radiographs of the knee. The tibial lesion in early <b>gonarthrosis</b> {{is located in the}} anterior and middle part of the medial plateau. In more advanced disease, when the anterior cruciate ligament is invariably damaged, the lesion extends to the posterior margin of the medial tibial plateau. We studied the preoperative radiographs of 200 knees with arthrosis. We were able to predict the integrity of the anterior cruciate ligament (and the use of unicompartmental arthroplasty) with 95 percent accuracy and rupture or damage to the anterior cruciate ligament (and the use of total condylar arthroplasty) with 100 percent accuracy.

40|$|Congenital patellar {{dislocation}} {{is a rare}} deformity {{and late}} presentation is usually with knee osteoarthritis. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is also a treatment choice of this rare pathology. There are few cases reported <b>gonarthrosis</b> with congenital patellar dislocation treated with TKA.

40|$|Osteotomy is {{used for}} {{correction}} of the altered load on the gonarthrotic knee joint. It can be performed above or below the knee. Clinical results depend on the correction after bone healing. By tibial closed wedge osteotomy (HTO), the deformity is corrected peroperatively in contrast to tibial hemicallotasis osteotomy (HCO) where the correction is performed after surgery. Comparing the two methods, the precision was better after HCO but the clinical results were similar at follow-up. After one year, the radiographic alignment of the leg was better after HCO, as was {{the stability of the}} osteotomy measured by RSA. In 308 operations, the most common complication after HCO was minor pin-tract infection. It was registered in 157 cases. Pin-tract care and oral antibiotics were sufficient as treatment in most cases. A loose external pin implies a risk for pin-tract infection. Hydroxyapatite-coating (HA) of the pin threads increased the fixation. HA-coating is recommended for use in metaphyseal locations where the risk for pin loosening is higher. 11 complications requiring re-operation were registered after 32 distal femoral osteotomies for lateral <b>gonarthrosis.</b> HCO was studied as treatment for lateral <b>gonarthrosis</b> and advanced medial <b>gonarthrosis.</b> The 2 -year results after 23 operations were similar to those after treatment for early medial <b>gonarthrosis.</b> In a matched study of knee arthroplasty, there was no increased radiostereometric migration of the tibial component after a previous tibial osteotomy...|$|E

40|$|Aim of the study: <b>Gonarthrosis</b> is a {{degenerative}} {{disease of the}} articular cartilage. Its main symptoms are pain, swelling, stiffness, limitation of functions and deformations of the joint. One of the available methods of preservative treatment of <b>gonarthrosis</b> is vibroacoustic therapy (VT), which evokes micro-vibrations in the tissues – {{through the use of}} sound waves of variable frequency and amplitude. The aim {{of the study was to}} estimate the influence of VT on the functional status of people with <b>gonarthrosis.</b> Material and methods: Forty-four people, aged over 44, with <b>gonarthrosis</b> were subjected to 10 sessions of VT with the Vitafon-T device, in a variable range of frequencies between 30 and 18   000 Hz. The sessions lasted 15 minutes. In order to estimate the effectiveness of the therapy, double measurements (before and after therapy) of the following parameters were taken: pain (VAS), joint circumferences and function tests (Timed Up and Go – TUG), the average free walking time at the 6 m distance and the knee bends test. The statistical analysis was carried out using the Wilcoxon test, with the significance level of p < 0. 0001. Results : In the examined group a decrease was observed in: pain (by 1. 9 VAS points among 77 % of the patients), circumference of the joints among 91 % and the time of conducting the TUG test in 96 %. The number of knee bends increased in 82 % of the patients. All the results reached statistical significance (p < 0. 0001). The free walking improved among 91 %; however, this result was not statistically significant. Conclusions : Vibroacoustic therapy has brought positive treatment effects of an analgesic and anti-swelling character, which has further influenced the functional efficiency of the patients with <b>gonarthrosis.</b> The research still needs to be expanded to other groups of patients before the method may be popularized in primary care rehabilitation facilities...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} the 2001 French burden of hospital primary joint replacement (PJR) for coxarthrosis and <b>gonarthrosis.</b> MethodsHospital surgical admissions for coxarthrosis and <b>gonarthrosis</b> in people aged over 40 years {{were selected from}} the French National Hospital Database. Of the 73, 150 and 58, 746 admissions for coxarthrosis and <b>gonarthrosis,</b> respectively, only 96 and 73 % of them were analysed (exclusion of stays with no respect of coding guidelines). For each, we described the type of osteoarthritis, gender and age group distribution, incidence rate of PJR adjusted on age and gender, the type of joint replacement (total vs partial), the type of hospital (private vs hospital), the mean length of stay (LOS), the percentage of patients transferred to rehabilitation centre and the hospital costs. ResultsWhatever the type of osteoarthritis, PJR was mainly performed for primary osteoarthritis, in the 71 – 80 years' age group, in private hospital, with a total replacement procedure. The mean LOS were 13 and 12 days, and the transfers to a rehabilitation centre were 33 and 44 %, for hip and knee, respectively. The incident rate of PJR increased significantly with age. It was higher in the 71 – 80 years' age group and decreased thereafter, whatever the gender {{and the type of}} osteoarthritis.

30|$|High tibial {{osteotomy}} (HTO) is {{a general}} procedure {{for the treatment of}} degenerative <b>gonarthrosis.</b> In recent years, {{it has been reported that}} opening wedge high tibial osteotomy (OWHTO) has become widespread with good results. Despite these facts, HTOs tend to be avoided due to the need for long-term postoperative treatment. To investigate the treatment period for total recovery (healing period) after OWHTO and the factors affecting it. There were 47 cases of medial type degenerative <b>gonarthrosis</b> who underwent OWHTO from 2008 through 2011. The definition of the healing period was based on the time-dependent changes of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association score, focusing especially on pain on walking and pain on ascending/descending stairs. This score was defined as the Ability score. In this study, the healing period ended when the Ability score reached its maximum or when it showed a perfect score. Patients’ characteristics were examined to determine their effect on the healing period. The Ability score was 36.7  ±  10.1 (mean ± SD) before surgery and 51.6  ±  5.4 12  months after OWHTO. The healing period was 6.3  ±  3.9  months. Factors correlated with a longer healing period included female sex (correlation coefficient − 0.35) and high BMI (correlation coefficient 0.33). Our study suggested that the healing period after OWHTO is approximately 6  months, and patients’ BMI and sex appear to be related to this period.
