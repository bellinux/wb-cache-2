The mathematical model has been presented in natural variables and, after transformation to symmetrical components, in a vector form.

In practical use, the number of laminations or punchings ranges from 40 to 66 per inch, and brings the eddy current loss down to about one percent. While the plates can be separated by insulation, the voltage is so low that the natural rust/oxide coating of the plates is enough to prevent current flow across the laminations.This is a rotor approximately 20mm in diameter from a DC motor used in a CD player. Note the laminations of the electromagnet pole pieces, used to limit parasitic inductive losses.|$|E
50|$|The {{fundamental}} {{basis for}} induced voltage in {{a magnetic field}} comes from Faraday's law describing an <b>induced</b> <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> (EMF) as follows:Emf = -N (∆Φb / ∆t)(Nave, C. R. 2011).This implies that {{as the number of}} magnetic flux lines increase or decrease there is a subsequent induced voltage of negative or positive polarity. However the relationship of electric forces and magnetic forces were summed up in Lorentz Force Law as F as follows:F = qE + qv x BHere all three forces were found to be perpendicular to each other (Nave, a, 2011). Thus Lorentz gave specially oriented direction to each of the forces allowing us to predict the direction of forces within the inductive pump architecture. Salamey further investigated the relationship of magnetic flux to circumferential area about the magnetic field where most of the magnetic forces were found to create mechanical forces used to direct the motion of the piston. Salamey further describes in his second patent the incorporation of a magnetic field gap. The gap is defined as a region of non-magnetic conduction circumferentially located {{at either end of the}} piston bore. The magnetic gap allows for increased propagation of magnetic flux through the magnetic piston body causing an increased force pulling the piston towards the magnetic end-pole (Salamey, 1999).|$|E
40|$|The {{acquisition}} of electroencephalograms (EEG) during functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) experiments raises important practical issues of patient safety. The presence of electrical wires connected to the patient in rapidly changing magnetic fields results in currents flowing through the patient due to <b>induced</b> <b>electromotive</b> <b>forces</b> (EMF), by three possible mechanisms: fixed loop in rapidly changing gradient fields; fixed loop in a RF electromagnetic field; moving loop in the static magnetic field. RF-induced EMFs were identified as the most important potential hazard. We calculated the minimum value of current-limiting resistance to be fitted in each EEG electrode lead for a representative worst case loop, and measured RF magnetic field intensity and heating in a specific type of current-limiting resistors. The results show that electrode resistance should be > or = 13 k(omega) for our setup. The methodology presented is general and can be useful for other centers...|$|R
40|$|A concise {{review of}} {{observations}} of the alpha dynamo effect in laboratory plasmas is given. Unlike many astrophysical systems, the laboratory pinch plasmas are driven magnetically. When the system is overdriven, the resultant instabilities cause magnetic and flow fields to fluctuate, and their correlation <b>induces</b> <b>electromotive</b> <b>forces</b> along the mean magnetic field. This alpha-effect drives mean parallel electric current, which, in turn, modifies the initial background mean magnetic structure towards the stable regime. This drive-and-relax cycle, or the so-called self-organization process, happens in magnetized plasmas in a timescale much shorter than resistive diffusion time, thus it is a fast and unquenched dynamo process. The observed alpha-effect redistributes magnetic helicity (a measure of twistedness and knottedness of magnetic field lines) but conserves its total value. It can be shown that fast and unquenched dynamos are natural consequences of a driven system where fluctuations are statistically either not stationary in time or not homogeneous in space, or both. Implications to astrophysical phenomena will be discussed...|$|R

25|$|These {{effects are}} derived from two {{fundamental}} observations of physics: a steady current creates a steady magnetic field described by Oersted's law, and a time-varying magnetic field <b>induces</b> an <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> (EMF) in nearby conductors, which is described by Faraday's law of induction. According to Lenz's law, a changing electric current through a circuit that contains inductance induces a proportional voltage, which opposes the change in current (self-inductance). The varying field in this circuit may also induce an EMF in neighbouring circuits (mutual inductance).|$|R
