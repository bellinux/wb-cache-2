50|$|While {{a single}} NR2 subunit {{is found in}} {{invertebrate}} organisms, four distinct isoforms of the NR2 subunit are expressed in vertebrates and are referred to with the nomenclature NR2A through NR2D (encoded by GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRIN2C, GRIN2D). Strong evidence shows that the genes encoding the NR2 subunits in vertebrates have undergone at least two rounds of gene duplication. They contain the binding-site for the neurotransmitter glutamate. More importantly, each NR2 subunit has a different intracellular C-terminal domain that can interact with different sets of signalling molecules. Unlike NR1 subunits, NR2 subunits are expressed differentially across various cell types and control the electrophysiological properties of the NMDA receptor.

40|$|Abstract Background Phenylethanolamines {{selectively}} bind to NR 2 B subunit-containing N -methyl- D -aspartate-subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors {{and negatively}} modulate receptor activity. To investigate the structural and functional {{properties of the}} <b>ifenprodil</b> binding domain on the NR 2 B protein, we have purified a soluble recombinant rat NR 2 B protein fragment comprising the first ~ 400 amino acid amino-terminal domain (ATD 2 B) expressed in E. coli. Spectral measurements on refolded ATD 2 B protein demonstrated specific binding to <b>ifenprodil.</b> We have used site-directed mutagenesis, circular dichroism spectroscopy and molecular modeling to obtain structural information on the interactions between critical amino acid residues and <b>ifenprodil</b> of our soluble refolded ATD 2 B proteins. Ligand-induced changes in protein structure were inferred from changes in the circular dichroism spectrum, and the concentration dependence of these changes {{was used to determine}} binding constants for <b>ifenprodil</b> and its analogues. Results Ligand binding of <b>ifenprodil,</b> RO 25, 6981 and haloperidol on soluble recombinant ATD 2 B determined from circular dichroism spectroscopy yielded low-to-high micromolar equilibrium constants which concurred with functional IC 50 measurement determined in heterologously expressed NR 1 /NR 2 B receptors in Xenopus oocytes. Amino acid residue substitutions of Asp 101, Ile 150 and Phe 176 with alanine residue within the ATD 2 B protein altered the recombinant protein dissociation constants for <b>ifenprodil,</b> mirroring the pattern of their functional phenotypes. Molecular modeling of ATD 2 B as a clam-shell-like structure places these critical residues near a putative ligand binding site.

Moreover, in an attempt to add further insight into the <b>ifenprodil</b> mechanism of action, as it is not completely clear if it binds and stabilizes an open or a closed conformation of the NR 2 B modulatory domain, a matter, which is fundamental for the rational design of NMDA antagonists, MD simulations followed by an MM-PBSA analysis were performed.

40|$|The {{atypical}} NR 2 B subunit-selective NMDA receptor antagonist <b>ifenprodil</b> {{was originally}} believed {{to act as}} a competitive antagonist at the polyamine binding site of the NMDA receptor. However, {{a number of studies have}} suggested that <b>ifenprodil</b> might bind to a distinct site. Using whole-cell voltage clamp recordings, we have studied the interaction of spermine with both <b>ifenprodil</b> and the related NR 2 B selective antagonist Ro 8 – 4304 at the NMDA receptor in rat cultured cortical neurones in the presence of saturating concentrations of glycine. <b>Ifenprodil</b> and Ro 8 - 4304 inhibited steady-state currents evoked by 100 μm NMDA in the absence of spermine with IC 50 values of 0. 3 and 0. 6 μm, respectively. In the presence of 1 and 3 mm spermine, IC 50 values for <b>ifenprodil</b> were 1. 4 and 1. 8 μm and for Ro 8 - 4304 they were 3. 0 and 7. 5 μm, respectively. In the presence of spermine, the on-time constant of receptor blockade by both antagonists was significantly slower than control and the off-time constant of recovery from receptor blockade following removal of Ro 8 - 4304 was significantly faster. Fast application of spermine during an NMDA steady-state current in the continuous presence of a subsaturating concentration of either antagonist resulted in a biphasic increase in the current, consistent with a fast increase upon spermine binding and a slow increase resultant from dissociation of antagonist due to spermine binding-induced allosteric reduction in receptor antagonist affinity. In agreement with this, at higher, saturating concentrations of antagonist, the slow increase in current amplitude was markedly reduced or absent. These observations are consistent with a non-competitive, allosteric interaction between spermine and the antagonists, such that spermine binding to the NMDA receptor results in a reduction in receptor affinity for the antagonists and vice versa.

40|$|Cue-elicited drug-craving {{correlates}} with hyperactivity within prefrontal cortex (PFC), which is theorized {{to result from}} dysregulated excitatory neurotransmission. The NMDA glutamate receptor is highly implicated in addiction-related neuroplasticity. As NMDA receptor function is regulated critically by its GluN 2 subunits, herein, we assayed the relation between incubated cue-elicited cocaine-seeking following extended access to intravenous cocaine (6 h/d; 0. 25 mg/infusion for 10 d) and the expression of GluN 2 A/B receptor subunits within PFC sub regions during early versus late withdrawal (respectively, 3 vs. 30 days). Cocaine-seeking rats exhibited elevated GluN 2 B expression within the dorsomedial aspect of the PFC (dmPFC); this effect was apparent at both 3 and 30 days withdrawal and occurred in cocaine-experienced rats, regardless of experiencing an extinction test or not. Thus, elevated dmPFC GluN 2 B expression appears to reflect a pharmacodynamic response to excessive cocaine intake that is independent of the duration of drug withdrawal or re-exposure to drug-taking context. The functional relevance of elevated dmPFC GluN 2 B expression for drug-seeking was assessed by the local infusion of the prototypical GluN 2 B-selective antagonist <b>ifenprodil</b> (1. 0 µg/side). <b>Ifenprodil</b> did not alter cue-elicited responding in animals {{with a history of}} saline self-administration. In contrast, <b>ifenprodil</b> lowered cue-elicited cocaine-seeking, while potentiating cue-elicited sucrose-seeking. Thus, the effects of an intra-dmPFC <b>ifenprodil</b> infusion upon cue reactivity are reinforcer-specific, arguing in favor of targeting GluN 2 B-containing NMDA receptors as a pharmacological strategy for reducing behavioral reactivity to drug-associated cues with the potential benefit of heightening the reinforcing properties of cues associated with non-drug primary rewards...|$|E

In this report, we investigated the possible role of LA and vmPFC NR 2 Bs in the consolidation of fear extinction using the NR 2 B-selective antagonist <b>ifenprodil.</b> We show that systemic treatment with <b>ifenprodil</b> immediately after extinction training disrupts extinction consolidation. <b>Ifenprodil</b> infusion into vmPFC, but not the LA, immediately after extinction training also disrupts extinction consolidation. In contrast, we also show pre-extinction training infusions into vmPFC has no effect. These results, together with our previous findings showing that LA NR 2 Bs are required during the acquisition phase in extinction, indicate a double dissociation for the phase-dependent role of NR 2 Bs in the LA (acquisition, not consolidation) and vmPFC (consolidation, not acquisition) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{lateral nucleus}} of the {{amygdala}} (LA) is {{an essential component of}} the neural circuitry underlying Pavlovian fear conditioning. Although blockade of NMDA receptors in LA and adjacent areas before training disrupts the acquisition of fear conditioning, blockade before testing also often disrupts the expression of fear responses. With this pattern of results, {{it is not possible to}} distinguish a contribution of NMDA receptors to plasticity from a role in synaptic transmission. In past studies, NMDA blockade has been achieved using the antagonist D,L- 2 -amino- 5 -phosphovalerate, which blocks the entire heteromeric receptor complex. The present experiments examined the effects of selective blockade of the NR 2 B subunit of the NMDA receptor in LA using the selective antagonist <b>ifenprodil.</b> Systemic injections of <b>ifenprodil</b> before training led to a dosedependent impairment in the acquisition of auditory and contextual fear conditioning, whereas injections before testing had no effect. Intra-amygdala infusions of <b>ifenprodil</b> mirrored these results and, in addition, showed that the effects are attributable to a disruption of fear learning rather than a disruption of memory consolidation. NMDA receptors in LA are thus involved in fear conditioning, and the NR 2 B subunit appears to make unique contributions to the underlying plasticity...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a common}} {{consensus}} that long-term depression is difficult to induce and maintain in aged animals. One possible explanation for this age-associated resistance to LTD induction might be in developmental changes associated with the NMDA-receptor complex. Previous reports with NMDAR 2 subunit specific antagonists led to the inference that LTP is mediated by NR 2 A subunits but LTD via the NR 2 B subunits. We now report that application of different NR 2 B subunit antagonists, such as <b>ifenprodil</b> and Ro 25 - 698 at concentrations reported previously to block LTD in younger animals failed to antagonise an input-specific NMDAR-dependent late (L) -LTD in aged (6 - 12 month old) mice. The same drugs, however, effectively blocked L-LTP. Only high concentrations of AP 5 (100 microM) and <b>ifenprodil</b> (10 microM), that block all known NR 1 /NR 2 heteromeric receptors, were sufficient to block L-LTD. However, these effects could not be mimicked by co-application of 50 microM AP 5 and 3 microM <b>ifenprodil,</b> since the co-application resulted only in partial inhibition. These findings indicate the existence of functional heteromeric receptors in aged mice that contain NR 2 -subtypes that as less susceptible towards the currently used NR 2 B-specific antagonists. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, {{one of the}} ionotropic {{glutamate}} receptor, plays important {{physiological and}} pathological roles in learning and memory, neuronal development, acute and chronic neurological diseases, and neurogenesis. This work examines {{the contribution of the}} NR 2 B NMDA receptor subunit to adult neurogenesis/cell proliferation under physiological conditions and following an excitotoxic insult. We have previously shown in vitro that a discrete NMDA-induced, excitotoxic injury to the hippocampus results in an increase in neurogenesis within the dentate gyrus. Here we have characterized adult neurogenesis or proliferation, using BrdU, in an in vivo model of excitotoxic injury to the CA 1 subfield of the hippocampus. We demonstrate a peak in neural stem cell proliferation/neurogenesis between 6 and 9 days after the excitotoxic insult. Treatment with <b>ifenprodil,</b> an NR 2 B subunit-specific NMDA receptor antagonist, without prior injury induction, also increased the number of BrdU-positive cells within the DG and posterior periventricle, indicating that <b>ifenprodil</b> itself could modulate the rate of proliferation. Interestingly, though, the increased level of cell proliferation did not change significantly when <b>ifenprodil</b> was administered following an excitotoxic insult. In conclusion, our results suggest and add to the growing evidence that NR 2 B subunit-containing NMDA receptors play a role in neural stem cell proliferation...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the properties of}} N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in cerebellar Golgi cells, patch-clamp recordings were made in cerebellar slices from postnatal day 14 (P 14) rats. To verify cell identity, cells were filled with Neurobiotin and examined using confocal microscopy. The NR 2 B subunit-selective NMDAR antagonist <b>ifenprodil</b> (10 μM) reduced whole-cell NMDA-evoked currents by ≈ 80 %. The NMDA-evoked currents were unaffected by the Zn 2 + chelator N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis-(2 -pyridylmethyl) -ethylenediamine (TPEN; 1 μM) suggesting the absence of NMDARs containing NR 2 A subunits. Outside-out patches from Golgi cells exhibited a population of ‘high-conductance’ 50 pS NMDAR openings. These were inhibited by <b>ifenprodil,</b> with an IC 50 of 19 nM. Patches from these cells also contained ‘low-conductance’ NMDAR channels, with features characteristic of NR 2 D subunit-containing receptors. These exhibited a main conductance of 39 pS, with a sub-conductance level of 19 pS, with clear asymmetry of transitions between the two levels. As expected of NR 2 D-containing receptors, these events were not affected by <b>ifenprodil.</b> The NMDAR-mediated component of EPSCs, evoked by parallel fibre stimulation or occurring spontaneously, was not affected by 1 μM TPEN. However, it was reduced (by ≈ 60 %) {{in the presence of}} 10 μM <b>ifenprodil,</b> to leave a residual NMDAR-mediated current that exhibited fast decay kinetics. This is, therefore, unlikely to have arisen from receptors composed of NR 1 /NR 2 D subunits. We conclude that in cerebellar Golgi cells, the high- and low-conductance NMDAR channels arise from NR 2 B- and NR 2 D-containing receptors, respectively. We found no evidence for NR 2 A-containing receptors in these cells. While NR 2 B-containing receptors are present in both the synaptic and extrasynaptic membrane, our results indicate that NR 1 /NR 2 D receptors do not contribute to the EPSC and appear to be restricted to the extrasynaptic membrane...|$|E
40|$|N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) were {{examined}} in substantia gelatinosa (SG) neurones of adult rat spinal cord slices. In somatic outside-out patches, high- and low-conductance NMDAR channels were present. The low-conductance channels exhibited asymmetrical transitions between the main (44 pS) and subconductance (19 pS) levels, suggesting that they arise from NR 2 D subunit-containing receptors. The high-conductance channels (main conductance, 57 pS) were blocked by <b>ifenprodil,</b> an NR 2 B subunit selective blocker. <b>Ifenprodil</b> {{had no effect on}} NMDA-EPSCs. The double-exponential decay time course and the apparent Kd for Mg 2 + of NMDA-EPSCs suggested the expression of NR 2 A subunit-containing receptors at the synapse. These results indicate that different NMDAR subtypes are expressed in subsynaptic and extrasynaptic regions of adult SG neurones, which may have differential roles in nociception...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE. To {{assess the}} neuroprotective effects of {{different}} glutamate modulation strategies, with a nonselective (MK 801) and a selective (<b>ifenprodil)</b> NMDA receptor antagonist and a metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist (mGluR Group II, LY 354740), in glaucoma-related in vivo rat models of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) apoptosis. METHODS. RGC apoptosis was induced in Dark Agouti (DA) rats by staurosporine (SSP) treatment. Single agents MK 801, <b>ifenprodil,</b> or LY 354740, or MK 801 and LY 354740 combined, were administrated intravitreally at different doses.

40|$|Haloperidol and <b>ifenprodil</b> are N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) {{receptor}} (NR) antagonists with {{preference for}} the NR 1 /NR 2 B subunit combination. Previous investigations utilizing 125 I-MK 801 binding assays with recombinant receptors distin-guished certain structural determinants on the NR 2 B subunit for these two drugs, with glutamate 201 being critical for hal-operidol sensitivity and arginine 337 being important for ifen-prodil block. Other studies, however, suggested that these two sites pharmacologically overlap. In an attempt to resolve these discrepancies, we have characterized the actions of haloperidol and CP 101, 606, an <b>ifenprodil</b> analog, on the single-channel properties of NR 1 /NR 2 B(E 201 R) receptors transiently ex-pressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, because receptors formed by NR 1 /NR 2 B(R 337 K) appear to be nonfunctional.
