5|$|In the 1990s, the <b>instrument</b> {{enjoyed a}} {{resurgence}} in popularity, resulting in Rhodes re-obtaining {{the rights to}} the piano in 1997. Although Harold Rhodes died in 2000, the <b>instrument</b> has since been reissued, and his teaching methods are still in use.|$|E
5|$|Musical <b>instrument</b> {{construction}} is a specialized trade that requires years of training, practice, and sometimes an apprenticeship. Most makers of musical instruments specialize in one genre of instruments; for example, a luthier makes only stringed instruments. Some make only {{one type of}} <b>instrument</b> such as a piano. Whatever the <b>instrument</b> constructed, the <b>instrument</b> maker must consider materials, construction technique, and decoration, creating a balanced <b>instrument</b> that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. Some builders are focused on a more artistic approach and develop experimental musical instruments, often meant for individual playing styles developed by the builder himself.|$|E

500|$|An ancient Hindu system {{named the}} Natya Shastra, {{written by the}} sage Bharata Muni and dating from between 200 BC and 200 AD, divides <b>instruments</b> into four main {{classification}} groups: <b>instruments</b> where the sound is produced by vibrating strings; percussion <b>instruments</b> with skin heads; <b>instruments</b> where the sound is produced by vibrating columns of air; and [...] "solid", or non-skin, percussion <b>instruments.</b> This system was adapted to some degree in 12th-century Europe by Johannes de Muris, who used the terms tensibilia (stringed <b>instruments),</b> inflatibilia (wind <b>instruments),</b> and percussibilia (all percussion <b>instruments).</b> In 1880, Victor-Charles Mahillon adapted the Natya Shastra and assigned Greek labels to the four classifications: chordophones (stringed <b>instruments),</b> membranophones (skin-head percussion <b>instruments),</b> aerophones (wind <b>instruments),</b> and autophones (non-skin percussion <b>instruments).</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to examine the}} securitization, negotiability and profitability aspects of three types of muèOErabah instruments; namely, asset-enfaced muèOErabah <b>instruments,</b> currency-enfaced muèOErabah <b>instruments</b> representing monetary contributions and currency-enfaced muèOErabah <b>instruments</b> representing real assets. This paper begins with a distinction between ribOE (usury) and profit and concludes that an exchange of currencyenfaced muèOErabah <b>instruments</b> in varying amounts entails ribOE while an exchange of asset-enfaced muèOErabah <b>instruments</b> will generate legitimate profits. The current practice is to issue currency-enfaced muèOErabah <b>instruments</b> but treat them as asset-enfaced muèOErabah <b>instruments.</b> This position is analyzed and policy implications are drawn for future development of muèOErabah <b>instruments.</b> MuèOErabah <b>instruments,</b> Islamic finance, Financial <b>instruments...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{clarinet}} {{was originally}} a central <b>instrument</b> in jazz, {{beginning with the}} New Orleans players in the 1910s. It remained a signature <b>instrument</b> of jazz music {{through much of the}} big band era into the 1940s. American players Alphonse Picou, Larry Shields, Jimmie Noone, Johnny Dodds, and Sidney Bechet were all pioneers of the <b>instrument</b> in jazz. The B soprano was the most common <b>instrument,</b> but a few early jazz musicians such as Louis Nelson Delisle and Alcide Nunez preferred the C soprano, and many New Orleans jazz brass bands have used E soprano.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} methods of classifying musical instruments. Various methods examine aspects such as the physical properties of the <b>instrument</b> (material, color, shape, etc.), the use for the <b>instrument,</b> {{the means by which}} music is produced with the <b>instrument,</b> the range of the <b>instrument,</b> and the instrument's place in an orchestra or other ensemble. Most methods are specific to a geographic area or cultural group and were developed to serve the unique classification requirements of the group. The problem with these specialized classification schemes is that they tend to break down once they are applied outside of their original area. For example, a system based on <b>instrument</b> use would fail if a culture invented a new use for the same <b>instrument.</b> Scholars recognize Hornbostel-Sachs as the only system that applies to any culture and, more important, provides only possible classification for each <b>instrument.</b> The most common types of <b>instrument</b> classifications are strings, brass, woodwind, and percussion.|$|E
50|$|The panerusan <b>instruments</b> or elaborating <b>instruments</b> {{are one of}} the {{divisions}} of <b>instruments</b> used in the gamelan. Instead of the rhythmic structure provided by the colotomic <b>instruments,</b> and the core melody of the balungan <b>instruments,</b> the panerusan <b>instruments</b> play variations on the balungan. They are usually the most difficult <b>instruments</b> to learn in the gamelan, but provide the most opportunity for improvisation and creativity in the performer.|$|R

5|$|A musical <b>instrument</b> is an <b>instrument</b> created or {{adapted to}} make musical sounds. In principle, any object that {{produces}} sound {{can be considered}} a musical instrument—it is through purpose that the object becomes a musical <b>instrument.</b> The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture. Early musical instruments may have been used for ritual, such as a trumpet to signal success on the hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies for entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications.|$|E
5|$|Another of Paco de Lucía's {{contributions}} was {{the inclusion}} of the cajón, an Afro-Peruvian <b>instrument</b> Caitro Soto exposed to him during his visit to Peru in the late 1970s.

Along with Rubem Dantas, he added its percussive elements and it became an essential tool of contemporary flamenco and later, other international musical trends.|$|E

50|$|Woodwind <b>instruments</b> are {{a family}} of musical <b>instruments</b> within the more general {{category}} of wind <b>instruments.</b> There are two main types of woodwind instruments: flutes and reed <b>instruments</b> (otherwise called reed pipes).

5|$|Chordophones, {{which produce}} sound by {{vibrating}} {{one or more}} strings; they are sorted into according {{to the relationship between}} the string(s) and the sounding board or chamber. For example, if the strings are laid out parallel to the sounding board and there is no neck, the <b>instrument</b> is a zither whether it is plucked like an autoharp or struck with hammers like a piano. If the <b>instrument</b> has strings parallel to the sounding board or chamber and the strings extend past the board with a neck, then the <b>instrument</b> is a lute, whether the sound chamber is constructed of wood like a guitar or uses a membrane like a banjo.|$|E
