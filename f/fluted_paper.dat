50|$|The {{recipe is}} {{relatively}} easy requiring only vegetable shortening, icing sugar, cocoa, desiccated coconut and Rice Bubbles (or Coco Pops). The hydrogenated oil is melted and combined with the dry ingredients and portions of the mixture are placed in cupcake pans to set, usually in the refrigerator. Sometimes these are lined with cupcake papers - round sheets of thin, rounded and <b>fluted</b> <b>paper.</b> The hydrogenated oil re-sets to give each cake its form without baking.|$|E
5000|$|An inline {{fuel filter}} is easily {{accessible}} {{from the front}} part of the engine. The filter retains solid particles and separates water from diesel (as water is heavier than diesel, it will settle {{at the bottom of}} the filter), just before the diesel fuel enters the highly sensitive high-pressure fuel pump. Water inside diesel fuel can lead to rusting of the internals of the engine, as well as lubrication problems. The filter element is made of <b>fluted</b> <b>paper</b> with metal end caps.|$|E
50|$|Corrugated board {{adhesives}} are {{the next}} largest application of non-food starches globally. Starch glues are mostly based on unmodified native starches, plus some additive such as borax and caustic soda. Part of the starch is gelatinized {{to carry the}} slurry of uncooked starches and prevent sedimentation. This opaque glue is called a SteinHall adhesive. The glue is applied on tips of the fluting. The <b>fluted</b> <b>paper</b> is pressed to paper called liner. This is then dried under high heat, which causes {{the rest of the}} uncooked starch in glue to swell/gelatinize. This gelatinizing makes the glue a fast and strong adhesive for corrugated board production.|$|E
50|$|The {{last two}} {{attributes}} of Erlenmeyer flasks make them especially appropriate for recrystallization. The sample to be purified is heated to a boil, and sufficient solvent is added for complete dissolution. The receiving flask {{is filled with}} a small amount of solvent, and heated to a boil. The hot solution is filtered through a <b>fluted</b> filter <b>paper</b> into the receiving flask. Hot vapors from the boiling solvent keep the filter funnel warm, avoiding the premature crystallization.|$|R
30|$|The {{contents}} were centrifuged for 10  min at 2000  rpm; after that, the {{supernatant solution}} was filtered through <b>fluted</b> <b>paper.</b> The filtrate was {{combined with the}} first extract, which is in a 100 -mL separatory funnel.|$|E
30|$|The {{centrifuge}} tube has been shaken {{very well for}} 10  min. The supernatant solution was filtered through <b>fluted</b> <b>paper</b> into a 100 -mL separatory funnel. Twenty milliliters of CH 3 OH was added into the residue; the {{centrifuge tube}} was shaken vigorously for 10  min.|$|E
