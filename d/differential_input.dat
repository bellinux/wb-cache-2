25|$|An {{operational}} amplifier (often op-amp or opamp) is a DC-coupled high-gain electronic voltage amplifier with a <b>differential</b> <b>input</b> and, usually, a single-ended output. In this configuration, an op-amp produces an output potential (relative to circuit ground) that is typically {{hundreds of thousands}} of times larger than the potential difference between its input terminals.|$|E
25|$|Common-mode gain: A perfect {{operational}} amplifier amplifies only the voltage difference between its two inputs, completely rejecting all voltages {{that are common}} to both. However, the <b>differential</b> <b>input</b> stage of an {{operational amplifier}} is never perfect, leading to the amplification of these common voltages to some degree. The standard measure of this defect is called the common-mode rejection ratio (denoted CMRR). Minimization of common mode gain is usually important in non-inverting amplifiers (described below) that operate at high amplification.|$|E

25|$|Gifford {{said that}} Widlar and Talbert were {{actually}} {{the founders of}} National Semiconductor, and that Sporck joined them later. The duo started by setting up the epitaxial process at Santa Clara. Once the technology was in place, Widlar concentrated on voltage regulators {{and by the end}} of 1966 produced the industry's first integrated linear regulator. The LM100, a revolutionary new circuit, became another flagship product that surpassed expectations for sales and longevity. In 1967 Widlar designed the LM101, an operational amplifier with improved gain, decreased input current, and protection against short circuit. The LM101 featured another unorthodox input stage, employing NPN input transistors emitter coupled to PNP transistors in a common base arrangement. The high reverse breakdown voltage of the PNP transistors allowed the LM101 to withstand a <b>differential</b> <b>input</b> voltage of ±30 V. Its frequency compensation was simpler and more robust and stable than that of μA709. It was followed by LM101A, a functionally identical IC that pioneered the use of a field-effect transistor to control internal current sources. Widlar's solution minimized die area and current drain, and enabled operation over a wide range of power supply voltages. Later he devised another new device, the super-beta transistor. It was created in silicon by Talbert and integrated in the LM108 precision operational amplifier, which was released in 1969. These high-gain, very-low-voltage devices were capable of operating at very low input currents within the full military range of operating conditions. The items in the linear circuit product line were user friendly, very useful, and very profitable.|$|E

50|$|The LM13700 is an {{integrated}} circuit {{consisting of two}} current controlled operational transconductance amplifiers (OTA), each having <b>differential</b> <b>inputs</b> and a push-pull output. The LM13700 is like a standard op-amp: each has a pair of <b>differential</b> <b>inputs</b> and a single output, but an OTA is voltage in and current out rather than voltage in and voltage out; and OTAs are programmable via the IABC pin. Linearizing diodes at the input reduce distortion and allow increased input levels. The darlington output buffers provided are specifically designed to complement the wide dynamic range of the OTA. This chip is very useful in audio electronics especially in analog synthesizer circuits like voltage controlled oscillators, voltage controlled filters, and voltage controlled amplifiers. The darlington output buffers on the LM13700 {{are different from those}} on the LM13600 in that their bias currents (and hence their output DC levels) are independent of IABC pin.

2500|$|Finite input {{impedances}} : The <b>differential</b> <b>input</b> impedance of {{the operational}} amplifier {{is defined as}} the impedance between its two inputs; the common-mode input impedance is the impedance from each input to ground. [...] MOSFET-input operational amplifiers often have protection circuits that effectively short circuit any input differences greater than a small threshold, so the input impedance can appear to be very low in some tests. However, as long as these operational amplifiers are used in a typical high-gain negative feedback application, these protection circuits will be inactive. [...] The input bias and leakage currents described below are a more important design parameter for typical operational amplifier applications.|$|E

Some multi-trace oscilloscopes use the external trigger input as an optional vertical input, and some have third and fourth channels with only minimal controls. In all cases, the inputs, when independently displayed, are time-multiplexed, but dual-trace oscilloscopes often can add their inputs to display a real-time analog sum.
