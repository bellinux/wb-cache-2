5000|$|This {{might seem}} counter-intuitive at first. But {{he uses the}} song [...] "Harper Valley PTA" [...] {{as a metaphor for}} how people can protect their eccentricities, and even some privacy, by assertively [...] "looking back."

25|$|Good Samaritan laws offer legal {{protection}} {{to people who}} give reasonable assistance to those who are, or who they believe to be, injured, ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated. The protection is intended to reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist, {{for fear of being}} sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death. An example of such a law in common-law areas of Canada: a good Samaritan doctrine is a legal principle that prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from being successfully sued for wrongdoing. Its purpose is to <b>keep</b> <b>people</b> <b>from</b> being reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions should they make some mistake in treatment. By contrast, a duty to rescue law requires people to offer assistance, and holds those who fail to do so liable.|$|E
500|$|Sometime around September 19, 1869, Corbin, at {{the urging}} of Gould, sent a letter to Grant desperately urging him not to release gold from the Treasury. Grant {{received}} the letter from a messenger while playing croquet with Porter at a deluxe Pennsylvania retreat. He finally realized {{what was going on and}} was determined to stop the gold manipulation scheme. When pressed for a reply to Corbin's letter, Grant responded curtly that everything was [...] "all right" [...] and that there was no reply. One Grant biographer described the comical nature of the events as an Edwardian farce. Grant, however, did have his wife Julia respond in a letter to Corbin's wife that Abel Corbin needed to get out of the gold speculation market. When Gould visited Corbin's house, he read the letter from Mrs. Grant containing the warning from Grant, after which he began to sell gold, while also buying small amounts of gold in order to <b>keep</b> <b>people</b> <b>from</b> getting suspicious. [...] Gould never told Fisk, who kept buying gold in earnest, that Grant was catching onto their predatory scheme.|$|E
500|$|Lee Ruth Davis, her sister, and two {{brothers}} were {{hidden by the}} Wrights while their father hid in the woods. On the morning of Poly Wilkerson's funeral, the Wrights left the children alone to attend. Davis and her siblings crept {{out of the house}} to hide with relatives in the nearby town of Wylly, but they were turned back for being too dangerous. The children spent the day in the woods but decided to return to the Wrights' house. After spotting men with guns on their way back, they crept back to the Wrights, who were frantic with fear. Davis later described the experience: [...] "I was laying that deep in water, that is where we sat all day long... We got on our bellies and crawled. We tried to <b>keep</b> <b>people</b> <b>from</b> seeing us through the bushes... We were trying to get back to Mr. Wright house. After we got all the way to his house, Mr. and Mrs. Wright were all the way out in the bushes hollering and calling us, and when we answered, they were so glad." [...] Several other white residents of Sumner hid black residents of Rosewood and smuggled them out of town. Gainesville's black community took in many of Rosewood's evacuees, waiting for them at the train station and greeting survivors as they disembarked, covered in sheets. On Sunday, January 7, a mob of 100 to 150 whites returned to burn the remaining dozen or so structures of Rosewood.|$|E

Davis responded by denying that Scientology <b>keeps</b> <b>people</b> <b>from</b> taking medications, and also denying that it claims to cure disease. He stated in one interview, [...] "The bottom line is that Scientologists seek conventional medical treatment for medical conditions." ...|$|R

[...] The statue is popular with tourists, who snuggle up to it, {{to have their}} pictures taken [...] "avec René" [...] (with René), despite repeated attempts by officials to <b>keep</b> <b>people</b> <b>from</b> touching the monument or getting too close to it. The statue had {{been the source of}} an improvised, comical and affectionately touching tribute to Lévesque. The fingers of his extended right hand are slightly parted, just enough so that tourists and the faithful could insert a cigarette, giving the statue an unusually realistic appearance.|$|E
2500|$|At {{some time}} during 2017 or 2018, the United States Department of State is {{expected}} to issue a next generation of the US biometric passport. The passport will have an embedded data chip on the information page protected by a polycarbonate coating; this will help prevent the book from getting wet and bending, and—should your passport be stolen—the chip will <b>keep</b> <b>people</b> <b>from</b> stealing your personal information and falsifying an identity. The passport number will also be laser cut as tapered, perforated holes through pages—just one of several components of the [...] "Next Generation" [...] passport, including artwork upgrade, new security features such as a watermark, [...] "tactile features," [...] and more [...] "optically variable" [...] inks. In other words: Some designs on pages will be raised, and ink—depending on the viewing angle—will appear to be different colors.|$|E
50|$|Because of many {{emotional}} and psychological dynamics, {{people can be}} reluctant to interact online. By evoking a mask of identity a person can create a safety net.

2500|$|Throughout the Cold War, {{many of the}} {{targeted}} countries' governments sponsored jamming of VOA broadcasts, which sometimes led critics to question the broadcasts' actual impact. For example, in 1956, Polish People's Republic stopped jamming VOA transmissions , but People's Republic of Bulgaria continued to jam the signal through the 1970s. Chinese language VOA broadcasts were jammed beginning in 1956 and extending through 1976. However, {{after the collapse of}} the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union, interviews with participants in anti-Soviet movements verified the effectiveness of VOA broadcasts in transmitting information to socialist societies. The People's Republic of China diligently jams VOA broadcasts. Cuba has also been reported to interfere with VOA satellite transmissions to Iran from its Russian-built transmission site at Bejucal. David Jackson, former director of Voice of America, noted: [...] "The North Korean government doesn't jam us, but they try to <b>keep</b> <b>people</b> <b>from</b> listening through intimidation or worse. But people figure out ways to listen despite the odds. They're very resourceful." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{his first}} month in office Chandler fired all the clerks {{in one room}} of the Patent Office declaring every desk vacant believing all the clerks were {{involved}} in either corruption or lacked the integrity for reform. [...] Chandler vacated the room and put in charge an African American porter to lock by key and <b>keep</b> <b>people</b> <b>from</b> entering the room until honest replacements were found. [...] Chandler {{paid no attention to}} complaints and warned a man who believed he was fired unjustly not to complain to the press. [...] Chandler without warning instigated an investigation by putting a new officer in charge of monthly payrolls of Patent Office employees taking the full names and addresses of everyone who signed them. Almost twenty employees were found to be fictitious created by a profiteering ring to defraud federal payroll monies. [...] Chandler also exposed and removed corrupt unqualified clerks who profiteered by hiring out their work to underpaid replacements. Chandler simplified Patent Office rules making patents easier to obtain and lessening their costs to the public.|$|E
2500|$|Electric fence {{comes in}} many styles of wire, rope and webbing, and is {{particularly}} useful for internal division of pastures. [...] It carries only a mild charge that causes a noticeable shock, but no permanent injury to animals or people. [...] It is relatively inexpensive and {{is easy to}} install, but if electricity fails, it is easily broken. [...] It is excellent both as a temporary fence and, in single strands, as a top or middle barrier to keep horses away from conventional fencing. There is some danger that horses can become tangled in an electric fence, though because the materials are finer, it usually breaks, stopping the current, though injuries are still possible. [...] Because electricity can fail, {{it should not be}} the sole fencing used on property boundaries, particularly next to roads, though a strand on top may be used to keep a horse from leaning over a fence made of other materials. [...] Nor should it be used alone in small pens where horses may accidentally bump into it on a regular basis. [...] However, small single-horse enclosures are sometimes seen at endurance riding competition, where temporary fencing must be set up in remote areas. [...] In residential areas, warning signs should be posted on any boundary fences with electrified sections to <b>keep</b> <b>people</b> <b>from</b> touching the fence and accidentally being shocked.|$|E

2500|$|As a man, Mar Samuel was {{distinguished}} for his modesty, gentleness, and unselfishness, being {{always ready}} to subordinate his own interests {{to those of the}} community. He said: [...] "A man may never exclude himself from the community, but must seek his welfare in that of society" [...] (Berakhot 49b). He demanded seemly behavior from every one, saying that any improper conduct was punishable by law (Ḥag. 5a). One should help one's fellow man at the first signs of approaching difficulties, so as to prevent them, and not wait until he is in actual distress (ib.). In his solicitude for helpless orphans he imposed upon every court the task of acting as father to them (Yeb. 67b; Giṭ. 37a, 52b); and he declared that a loan taken from an orphan was not canceled in the Sabbatical year, even if no prosbul had been made out for it (Giṭ. 36b-37a). He stored his grain until prices had risen, in order to sell it to the poor at the low prices of the harvest-time (B. B. 90b). In order to save the people from being cheated he ordered the merchants never to take a profit of more than one-sixth of the cost price (B. M. 40b), and he was ready even to temporarily modify the Law in order to prevent them from selling at a high price goods necessary for the fulfilment of a religious duty (Pes. 30a; Sukkah 34b). In a certain case also he permitted the infraction of a religious prescription in order to <b>keep</b> <b>people</b> <b>from</b> harm (Shab. 42a).|$|E
2500|$|Lead {{prosecutor}} Linda Drane Burdick in {{the prosecution}} rebuttal told the jurors {{that she and her}} colleagues backed up every claim they made in their opening statement six weeks ago, and implied that the defense never directly backed up their own opening-statement claims. [...] "My biggest fear is that common sense will be lost in all the rhetoric of the case," [...] she said, insisting that she would never ask the jury to make their decision based on emotion but rather the evidence. [...] "Responses to guilt are oh, so predictable," [...] she stated. [...] "What do guilty people do? They lie, they avoid, they run, they mislead... they divert attention away from themselves and they act like nothing is wrong." [...] She suggested that the garbage bag in the trunk of the car was a [...] "decoy" [...] put there to <b>keep</b> <b>people</b> <b>from</b> getting suspicious about the smell of the car when she left it abandoned in a parking stall directly beside a dumpster in an Amscot parking lot.

[...] she asked, stressing how George and Cindy Anthony were wondering where their daughter and granddaughter were in June and July 2008, the same time Casey was staying at her boyfriend's apartment while Caylee's body was decomposing in the woods. [...] "That's the only question you need to answer in considering why Caylee Marie Anthony was left {{on the side of the}} road dead." [...] Burdick then showed the jury a split-screen with a photo of Casey partying at a night club on one side and a close-up of the [...] "Bella Vita" [...] (meaning [...] "Beautiful Life") tattoo that she got weeks after Caylee died on the other.|$|E

This is largely because the media frames issues in a way that, more often than not, <b>keeps</b> <b>people</b> <b>from</b> fully realizing said frames. For instance, examining the media's coverage of three Nebraskan executions reveals that the death penalty was framed in a particularly positive way, to ensure media coverage would correspond with the public's growing support for capital punishment at the time. This meant that journalists did not focus on the problems or tensions within each case, nor did they ask public officials hard-hitting questions regarding the cases or the death penalty more broadly.|$|R
