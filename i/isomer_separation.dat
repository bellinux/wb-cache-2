5000|$|Regarding {{the set of}} columns, can be {{combined}} in various types. The Original column sets in the beginning were mainly poly(dimethylsiloxane) in the first dimension and poly(ethyleneglycol) in the second dimension. These so-called straight phase column sets are very suitable for Hydrocarbon analysis. Therefore, these are still used most frequent in Oil and Gas industry. If the application is to determine more polar compounds in a non-polar matrix. The reverse phase column set gives more resolution for the polar compounds. The first dimension column in this situation is a polar column, followed by a mid-polar second dimension column.For each application there can be an optimal column set. In this respective you can use also chiral columns for optical <b>isomer</b> <b>separation</b> or for example PLOT columns for volatiles and gas samples.To optimize the application {{is a bit more}} complex compared to 1D separations, as there are more parameters involved. Flow and oven temperature program are still very important but also hot jet pulse duration, length of the second dimension column and modulation time have a big influence on the final results. The outcome is also different. No longer a traditional chromatogram is produced, but now a 3 dimensional plot is produced by specially designed software [...] packages. It is a different way of evaluate data, but you get much more information. With modern software, you can perform group-type separation as well as automated peak identification (with Mass Spectrometry).|$|E
2500|$|The use of more polar {{solvents}} in {{the mobile}} phase will decrease the retention time of analytes, whereas more hydrophobic solvents tend to induce slower elution (increased retention times). Very polar solvents such as traces {{of water in}} the mobile phase tend to adsorb to the solid surface of the stationary phase forming a stationary bound (water) layer which is considered to play an active role in retention. [...] This behavior is somewhat peculiar to normal phase chromatography because it is governed almost exclusively by an adsorptive mechanism (i.e. analytes interact with a solid surface rather than with the solvated layer of a ligand attached to the sorbent surface; see also reversed-phase HPLC below). Adsorption chromatography is still widely used for structural <b>isomer</b> <b>separations</b> in both column and thin-layer chromatography formats on activated (dried) silica or alumina supports.|$|R

Research {{completed}} at Department of Chemistry, Fairmount College of Arts and SciencesThe specificity, sensitivity, and versatility of mass spectrometry (MS) have made it the dominant analytical tool. However, typical biological and environmental samples are complex enough to require prior separations, especially to disentangle the ubiquitous isomers. The unique specificity of novel field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) approach and its substantial orthogonality to MS make it attractive for <b>isomer</b> <b>separations.</b> The recently developed high-definition FAIMS enables previously impossible resolution of peptide and lipid isomers and even isotopomers.

An overview {{is presented to}} investigate the feasibility of metal-ligand complexes as functionalized solvents applied in a novel separation technology, reactive extractive distillation, for the separation and purification of a-olefins like 1 -hexene from other C 6 -olefin isomers (internal, branched, cyclic and diolefins) and paraffins by using p-complexation. Functionalized metal-ligand complexes were synthesized based on commercial available ligands from hydrometallurgy. In screening experiments they were evaluated for p-complexation with ethylene. The best solvents were selected for evaluation of preferential complexation of 1 -hexene relative to other olefin isomers. D 2 EHPA and DNNSA yield both stable metal-ligand complexes and triple the solubility of ethylene. Next, three different phosphoric acid ligands: D 2 EHPA, DBPA and MEHPA and two sulphonic acid ligands: DNNSA and DBSA, were investigated {{for a variety of}} C 6 -olefin isomers. The highest selectivities were obtained for silver-DBPA (20 wt% Ag, S/F = 3) : 1. 23 for 2 -methyl- 1 -pentene and 1. 42 for n-hexane.

Here, {{the utility of}} travelling-wave ion mobility mass spectrometry for <b>isomer</b> <b>separation</b> of high-mannose N-glycans is investigated. Negative ion fragmentation using collision-induced dissociation gave more informative spectra than positive ion spectra with mass-different fragment ions characterizing many of the isomers. <b>Isomer</b> <b>separation</b> by ion mobility in both ionization modes was generally limited, with the arrival time distributions (ATD) often showing little sign of isomers. However, isomers could be partially resolved by plotting extracted fragment ATDs of the diagnostic fragment ions from the negative ion spectra, and the fragmentation spectra of the isomers could be extracted by using ions from limited areas of the ATD peak. In some cases, asymmetric ATDs were observed, but no isomers could be detected by fragmentation. In these cases, {{it was assumed that}} conformers or anomers were being separated. Collision cross sections of the isomers in positive and negative fragmentation mode were estimated from travelling-wave ion mobility mass spectrometry data using dextran glycans as calibrant.

Demonstrated here for separations of the positional isomers of nitrophenol and naphthol as well as the enantiomers of hexobarbital and mephobarbital, the effect of small pressure perturbations on solute capacity factor ranges from + 11 to − 14 %. These changes in retention arise from pressure-induced shifts in solute equilibria and are used to estimate the change in molar volume upon solute binding with Β-cyclodextrin (Δ V comp). In this article, the effect of the mobile phase on pressure-induced shifts in solute retention is examined. Mobile-phase composition is observed to have a significant influence on the change in solute capacity factor with pressure and therefore on Δ V comp. As the composition of water in the mobile phase increases, the change in partial molar volume of complexation is observed to become more positive for both positional <b>isomer</b> and chiral <b>separations.</b> Although these studies imply that changes in solvent composition have a general effect on the observed Δ V comp and therefore on the change in pressure perturbation with solvent composition, it is clear that more studies are needed to establish the exact nature and breadth of this effect.  © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.  J Micro Sep 10 : 647 – 652, 199...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Chemistry, Washington State UniversityA recent bio-analytical {{application}} for ambient pressure ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IMMS) is the separation, detection, and identification of metabolites in complex biological matrices {{for the field}} of metabolomics. Metabolomics presents significant challenges in analytical measurements due to the diversity of metabolites and is described in detail in Chapters 1. This thesis concerns the evaluation and development of IMMS as applied to metabolomic strategies for monitoring dynamic metabolome shifts for discerning different physiological states and identifying changing metabolites in biological systems. The chapters in this thesis describe method development and data analysis for the following biological systems bacteria (E. coli (Chapter 2), cancer cell lines (Chapter 3), lymph fluid of fasting and fed rats (Chapter 4), human blood with a new IMMS design (Chapter 6), human plasma (Chapter 7), and anatomical isolated areas in rat brain (Chapter 5 and 8). For all of the experiments, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to view patterns in the data and to view which metabolites were changing the most from the controls to stress. The major findings from this thesis include: 1) overall drift time of negative ions are greater than positive ions indicating their collisional cross section is larger; 2) by coupling PCA with IMMS data patterns are viewed for different treatments; 3) online metabolomics databases couple well for identification of m/z by isotope and accurate m/z measurements; 4) quantitative analysis is accomplished using isotope dilution and standard addition; 5) applying mobility mass correlation lines to small metabolite molecules is possible for qualitative analysis {{to aid in the}} identification of metabolites in complex biological systems; 6) IMMS provides rapid <b>isomer</b> and/or isobar <b>separation</b> prior to the mass spectrometer allowing for less false positive results; 7) IMS prior to MS reduces chemical noise and enhances signal to noise ratios for analytes; 8) accurate isotope ratios are obtained by extracting m/z from specific drift times; and 9) IMMS has shown to be reproducible, sensitive, and at ambient pressure obtain a high resolving power. This approach illustrates the ability of IMMS as an analytical technique applied for the detection of metabolites in a variety of biological system.

Because {{it is now clear that}} the microflora play important roles in the development of the infant immune system, human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) are studied frequently. Milk samples contain complex mixtures of HMO, usually comprising several isomeric structures that can be either linear or branched. Traditionally, HMO profiling was performed using HPLC with fluorescence or UV detection. By using porous graphitic carbon liquid chromatography MS, it is now possible to separate and identify most of the isomers, facilitating linkage-specific analysis. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis allows fast profiling, but does not allow <b>isomer</b> <b>separation.</b> Novel MS fragmentation techniques have facilitated structural characterization of HMO that are present at lower concentrations. These techniques now facilitate more accurate studies of HMO consumption as well as Lewis blood group determinations. Adv. Nutr. 3 : 406 S– 414 S, 2012...|$|E
40|$|A narrow {{linewidth}} {{operating mode}} for the Ti:sapphire laser of the CERN ISOLDE Resonance Ionization Laser Ion Source (RILIS) has been developed. This satisfies the laser {{requirements for the}} programme of in-source resonance ionization spectroscopy measurements and improves the selectivity for <b>isomer</b> <b>separation</b> using RILIS. A linewidth reduction from typically 10 GHz down to 1 GHz was achieved by the intra-cavity insertion of a second (thick) Fabry-Perot etalon. Reliable operation during a laser scan was achieved through motorized control of the tilt angle of each etalon. A scanning, stabilization and mode cleaning procedure was developed and implemented in LabVIEW. The narrow linewidth operation was confirmed in a high resolution spectroscopy study of francium isotopes by the Collinear Resonance Ionization Spectroscopy experiment. The resulting laser scans demonstrate the suitability of the laser, in terms of linewidth, spectral purity and stability for high resolution in-source spectroscopy and isomer selective ionization using the RILIS.

40|$|AbstractMicroprobe two-step laser desorption/laser {{ionization}} {{mass spectrometry}} (μL 2 MS) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) {{were used to}} analyze polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in ancient terrestrial rocks. μL 2 MS provides an in situ analysis of very small samples, records the PAHs with no isomer information, and gives quantitative data {{on the degree of}} alkylation of a given PAH series over the complete mass range. GC/MS provides <b>isomer</b> <b>separation</b> and quantitation of PAHs in bitumen but not kerogen, and is limited by sample size. Combination of these techniques allows analysis of very small samples by μL 2 MS with GC/MS confirmation of isomer distributions of the solvent extractable components (bitumen). It was found that the concentration of bitumen within the rock samples affects the PAH alkylation signal for μL 2 MS. At low bitumen concentrations μL 2 MS can produce pyrolysis products from kerogen that is present; however, as bitumen concentrations increase, the PAH distribution from bitumen dominates the signal...|$|E
40|$|One major {{drawback}} in {{the synthesis}} of zeolite membranes {{is the lack of}} reproducibility ascribed to the support quality. In this paper, a gas-liquid displacement technique was used prior to pore-plugging hydrothermal synthesis to evaluate the quality of hollow fibre supports in terms of pore size distribution of surface pores. Using these supports, four nanocomposite MFI-hollow fibre membrane families were identified, showing different gas/vapour separation performance. The effective MFI thickness of these membranes (0. 6 - 1. 2 μm) was computed from pure N 2 and CO 2 permeance using Maxwell-Stefan modelling, while their separation performance was evaluated in the separation of n-butane/H 2, CO 2 /N 2 and ternary xylene isomer mixtures. The MFI-alumina hollow fibres displaying the best quality corresponded to those synthesized using hollow fibres with surface pore size distributions centred at 0. 2 μm, suggesting more efficient pore plugging.

40|$|Photoionization {{techniques}} (APPI and APLI) {{are important}} for the mass spectrometric analysis of crude oils, given the mainly unpolar character of the sample. Ultrahigh resolving Fourier Transform mass spectrometry (FTMS) allows to distinguish between most isobaric compounds {{as well as to}} unambiguously determine the elemental compositions of the detected ions. Nevertheless, the complexity of crude oil makes its thorough analysis a difficult task. Besides discriminating effects that can be avoided and depth of information that can be gained by simplification of the sample prior to the MS analysis the presence of numerous isomeric compounds limits the amount of information that can be gained by mass spectrometry alone. Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) {{has been shown to be}} a valuable tool for <b>isomer</b> <b>separation</b> and has also been employed for the analysis of crude oils using IMS-TOF MS. The application of an online FAIMS-FTMS coupling after photoionization for the analysis of crude oils is shown. With this setup the complementarity of data obtained from both APPI and APLI ionization is demonstrated. Online separation and individual detection of different hydrocarbon isomers is achieved...|$|E
40|$|Summary. New {{approaches}} to the synthesis of 2 -nitrobenzaldehyde by formation and selective <b>isomer</b> <b>separation</b> of 2 -nitrophenyl- 1, 3 -dioxolane and further hydrolysis are reported. In this route, the same acidic heterogeneous catalyst is used for 1, 3 -dioxolane formation and hydrolysis; it can be recycled several times without loss of ef®ciency. The ortho/meta isomers of 2 -nitrophenyl- 1, 3 dioxolane can be separated {{by a combination of}} stereoselective crystallization and fractionated distillation. This new route reduces safety and environmental hazards in the synthesis of 2 -nitro- and 3 -nitro-benzaldehydes. The molecular structures of the nitro derivatives were con®rmed by 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopy. The results are in accordance with a non-coplanar conformer of the 2 -nitro derivatives (2 -nitrobenzaldehyde and 2 -(2 0 -nitrophenyl) - 1, 3 -dioxolane), where the nitro group is twisted with respect to the phenyl ring. In contrary, both the carbonyl and the nitro group are coplanar with the phenyl ring in 3 -nitrobenzaldehyde. This result is consistent with the reactivity of the compounds...|$|E
40|$|Sialylated {{human milk}} {{oligosaccharides}} (SHMOs) are important components of human milk oligosac-charides. Sialic acids are typically {{found on the}} nonreducing end and are known binding sites for pathogens and aid in neonates ’ brain development. Due to their negative charge and hydrophilic nature, they also help modulate cell-cell interactions. It {{has also been shown}} that sialic acids are involved in regulating the immune response and aid in brain development. In this study, the enriched SHMOs from pooled milk sample were analyzed by HPLC-Chip/QTOF MS. The instrument employs a microchip-based nano-LC column packed with porous graphitized carbon (PGC) to provide excellent <b>isomer</b> <b>separation</b> for SHMOs with highly reproducible retention time. The precursor ions were further examined with collision-induced dissociation (CID). By applying the proper collision energy, isomers can be readily differentiated by diagnostic peaks and characteristic fragmentation patterns. A set of 30 SHMO structures with retention times, accurate masses, and MS/MS spectra was deduced and incorporated into an HMO library. When combined with previously determined neutral components, a library with over 70 structures is obtained allowing high-throughput oligosaccharide structure identification...|$|E

40|$|The binding of the {{geometrical}} isomers (≥ 99 % pure) {{of juvenile}} hormone I to the hemolymph juvenile hormone binding protein of Manduca sexta (Lepidoptera, Sphingidae) was analyzed. A technique is described for <b>isomer</b> <b>separation</b> by micropreparative high-resolution liquid chromatography. Analysis of competition {{was performed by}} using a “batch adsorption” hydroxylapatite binding assay. Competition studies indicate that the naturally occurring isomer, 2 E, 6 E, 10 cis, is bound with the highest affinity. Optimal binding appears to depend most heavily upon {{the configuration of the}} 2, 3 double bond. Juvenile hormone binding protein shows a higher affinity for the 2 E than for the 2 Z configuration. The 6, 7 double bond is of less importance in determining binding activity, and isomerism about the epoxide appears least important in conferring binding activity. The binding site may be a groove along the surface of the binding protein interacting with the side chains of juvenile hormone, including the ester methyl group. The grouping of the side chains and the ester methyl group thus constitutes a distinct hydrophobic face, and the hydrophobic interactions are essential in maintenance of the bound ligand...|$|E
