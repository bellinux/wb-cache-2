The present study assessed the clinicopathologic characteristics and ultrasound (US) features of TRN breast cancers. Methods: Pathological and biological data were reviewed for 558 breast cancer patients treated at Kangbuk Samsung Hospital, between January 2003 and December 2009. The patients were separated into TRN breast cancer and non-TRN breast cancer groups, {{based on the results}} of immunohistochemical prognostic panels. Clinical and pathologic features were compared for the two groups.

The advantages of this echography include short examination time. Also there is no known physical hazard to the patient, and the procedure is comfortable and well tolerated by the patient.

40|$|To {{compare the}} {{diagnostic}} performances between two computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems, this research trains one system by conventional ultrasound (US) {{and the other}} by spatial compound imaging, for differentiating between benign and malignant breast masses. The study obtains conventional US and spatial compound images in 128 patients with 140 masses including ninety-seven benign and forty-three malignant masses simultaneously. Each mass was characterized by eight computerized features including the morphological class (shape, orientation, and margin) and acoustic class (lesion <b>boundary,</b> <b>echo</b> pattern, and posterior shadowing). The study trained the binary logistic regression model by correlating the pathological results with the computerized features as a CAD system. When utilizing acoustic class features to construct CAD systems, the area indices under ROC curves were 0. 80 and 0. 85, respectively, using conventional ultrasound and using spatial compound imaging. The area indices were 0. 95 and 0. 97, respectively, using all features in conventional US and that in spatial compound imaging. The diagnostic performance of the CAD system did not significantly improved using spatial compound imaging. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} of defects with ultrasonic waves can be optimized if the ultrasonic wavelength lambda {{is comparable to}} the defect size d. This implements the other boundary conditions too: pulse length equal or bigger than 1. 5 lambda, sound beam diameter without focussing about 10 lambda, with focussing about lambda. Related to soldered joints and sound velocities inside the solder itself ultrasonic frequencies equal or bigger than 50 MHz are necessary. While qualifying bonds with lower frequencies (10 - 50 MHz) by phase <b>boundary</b> <b>echo</b> amplitudes, high frequency ultrasonic testing UT enables locating and sizing of defects. Quality assurance for high temperature and high strength ceramics recently improved the high frequency UT. Probes made by piezoelectric foils (PVF 2), thin films (ZnO, CdS) or buffer rods (Al 2 O 3,Si 3 N 4) and piezoelectric single crystals (LiTaO 3) allow to reach the frequency region above 250 MHz too. Imaging systems like the Scanning Laser Acoustic Microscope (SLAM) are anal yzing macroscopic volumes (cube millimeter) with microscopic resolution (some ten microns).
