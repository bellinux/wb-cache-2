The proposed finite difference schemes not only conserve the mass and energy in the discrete level but also are efficient in practical computation because only two linear systems need to be solved at each time step. Besides the standard energy method, an induction argument as well as a ‘lifting’ technique are introduced to establish rigorously the optimal $H^ 2 -error estimates without any restrictions on the <b>grid</b> <b>ratios,</b> while the previous works either are not rigorous enough or often require certain restriction on the <b>grid</b> <b>ratios.</b> The convergence rates of the proposed schemes are proved to be at $O(h^ 2 + τ^ 2) $ with mesh-size h and time step τ in the discrete $H^ 2 -norm.

40|$|Abstract. A {{new method}} for one {{dimensional}} adaptive grid generation is introduced based on defining the <b>grid</b> spacing <b>ratio</b> {{as a continuous}} variable. In this paper we validate our theoretical results {{in order to justify}} their use in numerical construction of adaptive grids in one dimension. 1. INTRODUCTORY REVIEW The use of adaptive grids is very common in solving ordinary or partial differential equations which exhibit frontal or boundary layer types of behavior. The motivation behind using adaptive grids is to improve the accuracy of solutions at an optimal computational cost by concentrating grid points in appropriate areas. There are many methods which have been developed to generate such adaptive grids [1, 2, 3] in one and two dimensions. In this paper we briefly describe a new method of generating such adaptive grids in one dimension (see also [4]). This method is based on approximating the <b>grid</b> spacing <b>ratio</b> as a continuous variable and using this as the prime generator of these adaptive grids. This method ensures that the <b>grid</b> spacing <b>ratio</b> is a smooth function and provides very high resolution. Oscillations in the <b>grid</b> spacing <b>ratio</b> are not desirable as these may cause serious problems in obtaining accurate solutions of partial differential equations numerically. This is particularly true when implici...|$|R

To overcome this numerical issue, an explicitly filtered LES formulation for {{the transport of}} scalar moments is developed. Using scalar mixing simulations of homogeneous isotropic turbulence and turbulent jet flow configurations, the convergence of scalar statistics with increasing filter to <b>grid</b> <b>ratio</b> is investigated. In particular, the evolution of scalar vari-ance is studied. Results in the simpler periodic flow domain show grid converged solution with filter to <b>grid</b> <b>ratio</b> of 4.

The influences are investigated with a series of sensitivity tests with parameter sweeps of spatial resolution and <b>grid</b> aspect <b>ratio.</b> We confirmed that the mixing length of the eddy viscosity and diffusion due to sub-grid-scale turbulence plays an essential role in reproducing the theoretical − 5 / 3 slope of the energy spectrum.

40|$|Radiography using {{film has}} been an {{established}} method for imaging the internal organs of the body for over 100 years. Surveys carried out during the 1980 s identified a wide range in patient doses showing that there was scope for dosage reduction in many hospitals. This paper discusses factors {{that need to be}} considered in optimising the performance of radiographic equipment. The most important factor is choice of the screen/film combination, and the preparation of automatic exposure control devices to suit its characteristics. Tube potential determines the photon energies in the X-ray beam, with the selection involving a compromise between image contrast and the dose to the patient. Allied to this is the choice of anti-scatter grid, as a high <b>grid</b> <b>ratio</b> effectively removes the larger component of scatter when using higher tube potentials. However, a high <b>grid</b> <b>ratio</b> attenuates the X-ray beam more heavily. Decisions about grids and use of low attenuation components are particularly important for paediatric radiography, which uses lower energy X-ray beams. Another factor which can reduce patient dose is the use of copper filtration to remove more low-energy X-rays. Regular surveys of patient dose and comparisons with diagnostic reference levels that provide a guide representing good practice enable units for which doses are higher to be identified. Causes can then be investigated and changes implemented to address any shortfalls. Application of these methods has led to a gradual reduction in doses in many countries. © 2007 Biomedical Imaging and Intervention Journal. All rights reserved.

40|$|A Monte Carlo {{model is}} {{developed}} {{to study and}} optimise the design of antiscatter grids in diagnostic radiology. The imaging chain including X-ray energy spectra, phantom (representing the patient), grid and image receptor is simulated. Image quality is quantified in terms of contrast (conventionai screen-film imaging) and signal-to-noise ratio, SNR (digital imaging) and the radiation detriment to the patient (risk) by the mean absorbed dose in the phantom. The advantages of using fibre instead of aluminium for grid interspaces and covers are quantified. Compared to aluminium grids, the absorbed dose is reduced by 10 - 50 %, contrast is improved by 0 - 10 % and SNR by 10 - 40 % (digital radiography). The advantages are larger at low tube potentials and for grids with high ratio and low strip density. Commercial grids, with different interspace materials, strip density, strip width and <b>grid</b> <b>ratio,</b> are compared in paediatric, lumbar spine and chest examinations. The differences in dose increase and contrast improvement factors obtained with these grids are mainly due {{to the use of}} different materials in the grid interspaces, but the strip design is also important. In a global optimisation of grid design and tube potential at fixed contrast, it is found that grids of different strip density and ratio all can have good performances provided that they are used with appropriate strip width and tube potential. In the paediatric examination, low ratio grids need thinner strips than used today to be optimal. A small air gap could alternatively be used. In examinations with more scatter (adult AP), present commercial grids are optimal (r= 12 - 16, d= 30 - 50 µm). In the lateral view (even more scatter), grids with ratios larger than 16 are optimal provided the grid can be accurately aligned in the beam. The optimization is performed with grids with fibre interspaces and covers since low atomic number materials should preferably be used for materials between the patient and the receptor. Optimal grids with aluminium for these components have lower <b>grid</b> <b>ratio</b> and higher strip densities than optimal fibre grids...|$|E
40|$|A new dual-communicator {{algorithm}} {{with very}} favorable performance characteristics {{has been developed}} for direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent mixing of a passive scalar governed by an advection-diffusion equation. We focus on the regime of high Schmidt number (Sc), where because of low molecular diffusivity the grid-resolution requirements for the scalar field are stricter than those for the velocity field by a factor root Sc. Computational throughput is improved by simulating the velocity field on a coarse grid of N-v(3) points with a Fourier pseudo-spectral (FPS) method, while the passive scalar is simulated on a fine grid of N-theta(3) points with a combined compact finite difference (CCD) scheme which computes first and second derivatives at eighth-order accuracy. A static three-dimensional domain decomposition and a parallel solution algorithm for the CCD scheme are used to avoid the heavy communication cost of memory transposes. A kernel is used to evaluate several approaches to optimize {{the performance of the}} CCD routines, which account for 60 % of the overall simulation cost. On the petascale supercomputer Blue Waters at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, scalability is improved substantially with a hybrid MPI-OpenMP approach in which a dedicated thread per NUMA domain overlaps communication calls with computational tasks performed by a separate team of threads spawned using OpenMP nested parallelism. At a target production problem size of 8192 (3) (0. 5 trillion) grid points on 262, 144 cores, CCD timings are reduced by 34 % compared to a pure-MPI implementation. Timings for 16384 (3) (4 trillion) grid points on 524, 288 cores encouragingly maintain scalability greater than 90 %, although the wall clock time is too high for production runs at this size. Performance monitoring with CrayPat for problem sizes up to 4096 (3) shows that the CCD routines can achieve nearly 6 % of the peak flop rate. The new DNS code is built upon two existing FPS and CCD codes. With the <b>grid</b> <b>ratio</b> N-theta/N-v = 8, the disparity in the computational requirements for the velocity and scalar problems is addressed by splitting the global communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD into disjoint communicators for the velocity and scalar fields, respectively. Inter communicator transfer of the velocity field from the velocity communicator to the scalar communicator is handled with discrete send and non-blocking receive calls, which are overlapped with other operations on the scalar communicator. For production simulations at N-theta = 8192 and N-v = 1024 on 262, 144 cores for the scalar field, the DNS code achieves 94 % strong scaling relative to 65, 536 cores and 92 % weak scaling relative to N-theta = 1024 and Nv = 128 on 512 cores...|$|E

To begin, we first investigate {{the accuracy of}} common-refinement method (CRM) to satisfy traction equilibrium condition along the fluid-elastic interface with non-matching meshes. We systematically assess the accuracy of CRM against the matching grid solution by varying grid mismatch between the fluid and solid meshes over a cylindrical tubular elastic body. We demonstrate second-order accuracy of CRM through uniform refinements of fluid and solid meshes along the interface. We then extend the error analysis to transient data transfer across non-matching meshes between fluid and solid solvers. We show that the common-refinement discretization across non-matching fluid-structure grids yields accurate transfer of the physical quantities across the fluid-solid interface.

Results for air are presented. The ideal-gas law is used and viscosity is given by Sutherland's law. An accurate low-Mach number solver is developed. Hereby an explicit third-order discretization for the convective part and a line-implicit central discretization for the acoustic part and for the diffusive part are used. The semi-implicit line method is formulated in multistage form. Multigrid is used as acceleration technique. A convergence behaviour is obtained which is independent of grid size, <b>grid</b> aspect <b>ratio,</b> Mach number and Rayleigh number. Grid converged results are shown for Rayleigh numbers between 102 and 107...|$|R
40|$|The first {{comprehensive}} experimental {{investigation of}} two-grid accelerator systems is presented. A {{wide range of}} geometrical grid parameters and grid set operating conditions were investigated for their effect on ion beam divergence. Ion beam divergence was found to depend most strongly on normalized perveance per hole, <b>grid</b> separation <b>ratio,</b> net-to-total accelerating voltage ratio, and discharge-to-total accelerating voltage ratio variations. The graphical results contained herein provide guidelines {{for the design of}} ion accelerator systems. A general ion beam divergence angle correlation was developed to permit approximate beam divergence estimates, at parametric values other than those tested, of present grid set designs. Although argon was the main test gas used in this study, it is shown that the results are applicable to other propellants as well...|$|R
40|$|A multigrid {{procedure}} that {{makes use of}} coarse grids generated by the agglomeration of control volumes is advocated as a practical approach for solving the threedimensional Euler equations on unstructured grids about complex configurations. It is shown that the agglomeration procedure can be tailored to achieve certain coarse grid properties such as the sizes of the coarse <b>grids</b> and aspect <b>ratios</b> of the coarse grid cells. The agglomeration is done as a preprocessing step and runs in linear time...|$|R
