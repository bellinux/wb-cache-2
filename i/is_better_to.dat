5|$|The {{change in}} {{partners}} leads the Simpson family to begin arguing and aggressively competing against one another. The tournament takes place, {{and in the}} stands, are leading tennis professionals Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras, Venus Williams, and Serena Williams. At the tournament, Homer ditches Lisa for Venus Williams. In response, Marge replaces Bart with Serena Williams as her partner. Ultimately, Serena and Venus replace Marge and Homer with Sampras and Agassi, respectively. This forces the family {{to go back to}} the bench and resume their normal places in the family. As they enjoy the exhibition of top-class tennis, they agree that it <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> watch things than to do things, and Homer offers to buy the family dinner with money he took from Sampras' wallet.|$|E

25|$|Karma–Sanyasa yoga (Religion by Renouncing Fruits of Works {{contains}} 29 verses): Arjuna asks Krishna if it <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> forgo {{action or}} to act ("renunciation or discipline of action").

25|$|Several exobiologists have {{suggested}} that a Mars sample return is not necessary at this stage, and that it <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> focus more on in situ studies on the surface first. Although it is not their main motivation, this approach of course also eliminates back contamination risks.|$|E
25|$|Yet, some {{differentiation}} {{has to be}} {{made between}} these indigestible plant components and other partially digested material, such as protein, that appears in the large bowel. Thus, it <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> classify fiber as a group of compounds with different physiological characteristics, rather than to be constrained by defining it chemically (end quote).|$|E
25|$|According to the British National Formulary, it <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> {{withdraw}} {{too slowly}} rather than too quickly from benzodiazepines. The {{rate of dosage}} reduction is best carried out so as to minimize the symptoms' intensity and severity. Anecdotally, a slow rate of reduction may {{reduce the risk of}} developing a severe protracted syndrome.|$|E

25|$|Owing to the {{physical}} assumptions made in the original derivation, the term Fowler-Nordheim-type equation has long been used only for equations that describe the ECD at zero temperature. However, it <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> allow this name to include the slightly modified equations (discussed below) that are valid for finite temperatures within the CFE emission regime.|$|E
25|$|When {{the land}} needs a {{subsurface}} drainage system, but saline groundwater is present at great depth, it <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> employ a shallow, closely spaced system of pipes or ditches {{instead of a}} deep, widely spaced system. The {{reason is that the}} deeper systems produce a more salty effluent than the shallow systems. Environmental criteria may then prohibit the use of the deeper systems.|$|E
25|$|Horses require {{access to}} clean fresh water at all times, {{and access to}} {{adequate}} forage such as grass or hay. Unless an animal can be fully maintained on pasture with a natural open water source, horses must be fed daily. As horses evolved as continuous grazers, it <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> feed small amounts of feed throughout the day than to feed a large amount at one time.|$|E

25|$|Smaller {{parrotfish}} {{are relatively}} defenceless herbivores, poorly defended against predators like barracuda. They {{have evolved to}} find protection by schooling, sometimes with other species like shoaling rabbitfish. Spinefoot rabbitfish are named for their defensive venomous spines, and they are seldom attacked by predators. Spines are a last-ditch defence. It <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> avoid predator detection in the first place, and avoid being thrust into risky spine-to-fang battles. So rabbitfish have also evolved skilful colour changing abilities.|$|E

ODA leader Pavel Sehnal said that Kulhánek is a right-wing candidate, that was missing in the election. Miloš Zeman stated {{that he does not}} know Kulhánek well but remembers him as a successful manager of Škoda Auto, adding that he does not have a problem with Kulhánek's candidacy because he believes that it <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> have more candidates.|$|E
25|$|The goal of full {{employment}} was of most importance to Petty, having recognised that labour {{was one of}} the major sources of wealth for individuals and 'the greatest Wealth and Strength of the Kingdom'. In this vein, he extended the cloth-wine argument above, arguing that it <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> employ men and burn their product or to engage in extravagant public works projects, than to have indolent 'supernumeraries' in an economy – hence his famous example of relocating Stonehenge across the plains of Salisbury.|$|E

25|$|Del Toro {{wanted to}} include a fairy tale about a dragon for Ofelia to narrate to her unborn brother. The tale {{involved}} the dragon, named Varanium Silex, who guarded a mountain surrounded by thorns, but at its peak is a blue rose that can grant immortality. The dragon and the thorns ward off many men though, who decide it <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> avoid pain than to be given immortality. Although the scene was thematically important, it was cut short for budget reasons.|$|E
25|$|Remote {{burning of}} the {{explosive}}. Where possible, it <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> burn the explosive without detonation. Diethylene triamine (a close relative of ethylenediamine) reacts with TNT to generate heat. The compound that results from this reaction can then be combusted without detonation. It {{has been reported that}} this amine is hypergolic with TNT, Tetryl, Composition B and other TNT based explosives, but it does not react in the same way with RDX or PETN-based explosives. Other nitrogen-containing organic ligands (e.g. pyridine, diethylamine and pyrole) are known to be hypergolic with TNT.|$|E
25|$|Experienced aquarists warn against {{applying}} {{these rules}} too strictly {{because they do}} not consider other important issues such as growth rate, activity level, social behaviour, filtration capacity, total biomass of plant life, and so on. It <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> apply the overall mass and size of a fish per gallon of water, than simply the length. This is because fish of different sizes produce quite differing amounts of waste. Establishing maximum capacity is often a matter of slowly adding fish and monitoring water quality over time, following a trial and error approach.|$|E
