According to Kretz, [...] "It {{was just something}} to kind of symbolize more of our attitude right now....

2500|$|However, {{her style}} of humor, which often relied on making jokes {{about her own}} life and satirizing the lives of celebrities and public figures, was {{sometimes}} criticized as insensitive. Her jokes about Elizabeth Taylor and Adele's weight, for instance, were often commented on, although Rivers would never apologize for her humor. Rivers, who was Jewish, was also criticized for making jokes about the Holocaust and later explained, [...] "This is the way I remind people about the Holocaust. I <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>through</b> humor", adding, [...] "my husband lost his entire family in the Holocaust." [...] Her joke about {{the victims of the}} Ariel Castro kidnappings similarly came under criticism, but she again refused to apologize, stating, [...] "I know what those girls went through. It was a little stupid joke." [...] She received multiple death threats throughout her career.|$|E

25|$|In July 1943, the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was {{dispatched}} to England and {{came under the}} command of the 3rd Parachute Brigade of the British 6th Airborne Division.

5000|$|Likewise, Tommy Steele, the Beatles with Beatlemania, the Rolling Stones, and The Beach Boys were teen idols, {{especially}} during the earlier part of their careers, although they quickly grew out of that status. The Rolling Stones <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>through</b> a more rebellious image, the Beatles <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>through</b> their more developed (or [...] "grown up") music. Similarly, Neil Sedaka had two distinct eras of his career, with about a decade in between: one as a teen idol in the 1960s, and a later career in adult contemporary music. From the family band the Cowsills, Susan Cowsill, John Cowsill and Barry Cowsill became teen idols and were on teen magazine covers for many years; the TV show The Partridge Family was written in their likeness. Many of the teen idols of the era were the sons of older, established stars; Dino, Desi & Billy were active as teen idols during the mid-sixties. The group included Desi Arnaz Jr (son of bandleader Desi Arnaz), Dean Paul Martin (son of singer Dean Martin), and Billy Hinsche (a mutual friend whose parents were not famous). Gary Lewis, son of comedian Jerry Lewis, fronted The Playboys during this era.|$|R
