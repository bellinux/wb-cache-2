500|$|A parting line, sprue, gate <b>marks,</b> and <b>ejector</b> <b>pin</b> <b>marks</b> {{are usually}} {{present on the}} final part. [...] None of these {{features}} are typically desired, but are unavoidable {{due to the nature}} of the process. Gate marks occur at the gate which joins the melt-delivery channels (sprue and runner) to the part forming cavity. Parting line and <b>ejector</b> <b>pin</b> <b>marks</b> result from minute misalignments, wear, gaseous vents, clearances for adjacent parts in relative motion, and/or dimensional differences of the mating surfaces contacting the injected polymer. Dimensional differences can be attributed to non-uniform, pressure-induced deformation during injection, machining tolerances, and non-uniform thermal expansion and contraction of mould components, which experience rapid cycling during the injection, packing, cooling, and ejection phases of the process. Mould components are often designed with materials of various coefficients of thermal expansion. These factors cannot be simultaneously accounted for without astronomical increases in the cost of design, fabrication, processing, and quality monitoring. The skillful mould and part designer will position these aesthetic detriments in hidden areas if feasible.|$|R
40|$|Die casting is a {{versatile}} manufacturing technique in which molten metal is poured into die. The die consists of core and cavity, an impression is formed when these core and cavity are closed together. This impression forms {{the shape and}} size of the component. The main challenge in die casting is design and manufacturing of die. Integration of design and analysis yields to better results. Die casting is often encountered with many problems, few of such problems are blowholes, improper filling, scratch marks, weld lines, cracks, cold shut, porosity, blisters, <b>ejector</b> <b>pin</b> <b>marks,</b> etc. usually these defects are caused due to improper design of dies, or due to incorrect parameters such as injection pressure, cycle time, cooling circuits and other such parameters. In order to eliminate such defects a set of analysis has to be carried to ensure that design and other parameters are safe and efficient. Through analysis is carried to understand how the molten metal behaves inside the dies once it is injected, a clear picture about how the molten metal gets solidified is obtained during analysis.

Trumpeter has a cooperation with Japanese ship model manufacturer Pit-Road for kits in 1:700 scale. These kits are usually available under the Pit-Road label in Japan {{and under the}} Trumpeter label {{in the rest of}} the world.Trumpeter's ship models have included a rising number of parts, but quality is still disputed due to insufficient research and some recent releases have been over-engineered. For example, the 1:350 scale kit of the American aircraft carrier USS Hornet (CV-8) (an early release) has been found to compromise in detail ("disappointment"), while the hull form shows major mistakes and the island is also not perfect. Fit, however, is said to be excellent, and surface detail [...] "very credible". Also modern US carriers (for example the 1/700 Nimitz-class aircraft carriers) suffer from a wrong hull form. Hull form problems are also found in the Baltimore-class cruiser kits. Mistakes in the correct outfit (catapults, armament) have been pointed out regarding the details of some Essex-class carrier kits and the Bismarck-class battleships (wrong AA fit). Especially regarding the Essex class, the well known modeller Scott van Aken on the Modeling Madness website praises the kits of a competitor as preferable over Trumpeter: [...] "The moldings on the kit (of the competitor) are top rate and without the myriad of <b>ejector</b> <b>pin</b> <b>marks</b> that have plagued Trumpeter ship kits since day one." ...|$|R

One of the main drawbacks of the process is the tendency of the tools to be damaged during part ejection 1. At De Montfort University a successful AIM™ moulding cycle has been developed in which simple shapes from polypropylene are produced and the ejection forces required are measured. Two different ejection methods are used; one uses conventional <b>ejector</b> <b>pins</b> and the other uses a conformal ejector pad. The tool surface roughness is measured before and after moulding to observe any changes caused by ejection. Results show that <b>ejector</b> <b>pins</b> require a lower ejection force than a conformal ejector pad and this may contribute to longer tool life for the AIM™ process. Possible reasons for the results are discussed along with recommendations for further work...|$|R

An injection mould is a tool which is used for production of plastic components in large numbers in a short span of time. The moulding tool consists of the Top plate, Cavity plate, Core plate, Spacer blocks, Ejector plate and the Bottom plate. In this work, six core <b>pins</b> and six <b>ejector</b> <b>pins</b> are provided on injection mould because the required cam bush has six indexing holes. The material, Oil Hardened Non-shrinking Steel(OHNS) for the core and cavity, EN 353 for the guide pillar, guide bushes, core <b>pins,</b> <b>ejector</b> <b>pins,</b> locator ring and the sprue bush and Mild Steel for other plates are selected. The elements of injection moulding tool have been designed, fabricated and assembled.
