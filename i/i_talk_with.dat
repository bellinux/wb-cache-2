2500|$|From Rawat's first {{travels in}} the West, {{he and his}} {{followers}} attracted media attention. In an interview in Der Spiegel in 1973, Rawat said, [...] "I have lost confidence in newspapers. <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> them [...] {{and the next day}} something completely different is printed." [...] In 1973, the Divine Light Mission's 50-member public relations team concluded that Rawat's credibility had been compromised by his youth, his physical appearance, and the Rolls Royce, as well as the Detroit [...] "pieing" [...] incident and an allegation of smuggling (which was never prosecuted). The head of the team said that they needed to get the public to look past these factors to judge Rawat's credibility.|$|E
2500|$|A month later, LaRouche held a {{press conference}} to accuse the Soviet government, British government, drug dealers, {{international}} bankers, and journalists of being involved in a variety of conspiracies. Flanked by bodyguards, he said, [...] "If Abe Lincoln were alive, he'd probably be standing up here with me today," [...] {{and that there was no}} criticism of him that did not originate [...] "with the drug lobby or the Soviet operation ..." [...] He said he had been in danger from Soviet assassins for over 13 years, and had to live in safe houses. He refused to answer a question from an NBC reporter, saying [...] "How can <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> a drug pusher like you?" [...] He called the leadership of the United States [...] "idiotic" [...] and [...] "berserk," [...] and its foreign policy [...] "criminal or insane." [...] He warned of the imminent collapse of the banking system and accused banks of laundering drug money. Asked about the movement's finances, he said [...] "I don't know. ... I'm not responsible, I'm not involved in that." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{situation}} grows tense. There {{are no more}} sea-birds, and the mutineers are starving. Yesterday <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> Bert Rhine. To-day <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> him again, and he {{will never}} forget, I am certain, the little talk we had this morning.|$|R

60|$|As {{the scene}} I had {{witnessed}} appeared unusual I related {{it to the}} very next shepherd <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with.</b>|$|R
60|$|While my {{companion}} <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> the women, <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> the old man. They {{said that he}} was old and foolish, but he was evidently too knowing for them.|$|R

6000|$|He winced, but he {{knew that}} he {{deserved}} the little scratch. He did not try to exculpate himself, but he asked, [...] "May <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> Miss Maybough about it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> {{her this}} afternoon," [...] I objected, [...] "and I found her a {{sensible}} woman--remarkably bright {{for one of}} her years." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> {{a wounded}} Gordon Highlander--one {{of those who}} dashed across the famous {{causeway}} of Dargai and breasted the still more glorious slope of Elandslaagte.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> her a little, {{and found}} her sensible, vivacious, and firm-textured, rather than soft and sentimental. She paid me some compliments; but I do not {{remember}} paying her any.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Dr. Britt," [...] began Kate, firmly, [...] "I {{want you}} to keep that boresome old man {{occupied}} while <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> these women. I don't want him putting in his oar." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dear May! when <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> you, <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> my good genius; but I am {{in closer}} and more {{constant}} converse with another mind, and of that I am the slave. It is my own. I will not conceal from you, from whom I have concealed nothing, that doubts and dark misgivings {{of the truth}} and wisdom of my past feelings and my past career will ever and anon flit across my fancy, and obtrude themselves upon my consciousness. Your father--yes! I feel that I have not been to him what nature intended, and what he deserved.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And if it should, do {{you think}} we could attend to more customers? Every minute <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> you is so much money lost, for the other fellers can't pick up rings an' make change fast enough." ...|$|E
60|$|Years ago, <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> {{a couple}} of the Vicksburg non-combatants--a man and his wife. Left to tell their story in their own way, those people told it without fire, almost without interest.|$|R

6000|$|... "Biddy," [...] said <b>I,</b> when <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> {{her after}} dinner, as {{her little girl}} lay {{sleeping}} in her lap, [...] "you must give Pip to me one of these days; or lend him, at all events." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, Mary, {{come and}} sit by me while <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> you. I {{want to know}} how you came to be in this wild, out-o'-the-way place, and who Dick is, and what brought him here, an' in short, all about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not last, no," [...] replied Har√ªt, [...] "that not possible. That {{bring us}} all to grave. Also no good, 'cause her mind empty. For rest, you come to other place, sit down and eat while <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> priests. Be afraid nothing; you quite safe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Moosa, {{we must be}} prompt," [...] {{continued}} Yoosoof; [...] "let some of you get round {{behind the}} Englishmen, and have the slave-chains handy. Keep your eye on me while <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> them; if they are refractory, a nod shall be the signal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Boyne said that, and Lottie. I {{took it for}} granted, till <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> him to-day. He is light-hearted and gay; {{he likes}} to laugh and joke; but he can be very serious when he wants to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No go," [...] she answered. [...] "I {{spent the}} {{evening in the}} club and <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> two men who knew Craig, but I couldn't get on to anything. From all I could hear of the man, respectability is his middle name." ...|$|R

"When you crawl on your belly, {{along the}} open deck, {{in the broad}} light of day, like a yellow cur that has been licked to obedience, and when you show by your every action that you like it and are glad to do it, then, and not until then, will <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Woman!" [...] broke {{forth the}} Judge, {{giving way to}} his resentment, [...] "what {{is the meaning of}} all this? Have you other resources? Nay, I {{suspected}} as much! Take care, Hepzibah, take care! Clifford is on the brink of as black a ruin as ever befell him yet! But why do <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> you, woman as you are?

6000|$|... 'May <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> you a little, later?' {{he asked}} of Dora, {{with only a}} few seconds for the question, as people were {{pressing}} behind him. She answered evasively that there would be very little talk--they would all have to listen--it was very serious; and the next moment he had received a programme from the hand of a monumental yet gracious personage who stood beyond and who had a silver chain round his neck.|$|E
6000|$|FAITH. Why, {{at first}} I found myself {{somewhat}} inclinable {{to go with}} the man, for I thought he spake very fair; but looking in his forehead, as <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> him, <b>I</b> saw there written, [...] "Put off the old man with his deeds." ...|$|R
6000|$|The name {{seemed to}} affect Putney pleasantly; he smiled, {{and then he}} said, [...] "Brother Wade is a good man, and his words usually carry conviction, {{but this is a}} serious subject, Mr. Hilary."
