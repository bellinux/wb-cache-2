50|$|The {{tendency}} to reject Cugler's writings began early: as Manolescu noted, {{he was not}} reviewed at all in George Călinescu's History of Romanian Literature, which first saw print in 1941. Overall, Paul Cernat concluded, no work of literary criticism published during the interwar period ever mentioned his Apunake. In Communist Romania, he was almost never publicly mentioned. One exception to this rule is a fugitive 1983 note written by critic Constantin Ciopraga, who simply described Cugler as one of Urmuz's epigones, and argued that he lacked Urmuz's concision. In 1969, {{at a time when}} the Nicolae Ceauşescu regime offered a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberalization,</b> Surrealist writer Saşa Pană included Grigore Cugler in his anthology of Romanian avant-garde texts. He was not however present in similar collections, including the one edited by Ovid Crohmălniceanu. This tendency, Cernat argues, was owed in large part to Cugler's enduring status as an anti-communist, which prevented his writings from being mentioned or recuperated, in contrast to those of Urmuz.|$|E

However, the effects of freer trade on profits of the exporting countries are ambiguous and depend on the net gains in profit from free trade.

In this paper, he addressed the issue of a definition of empiricism, several years after abandoning the quest for a unique and universal logical framework supposed to be the basis of a clear distinction between the meaningful sentences of science and the pseudo-sentences of metaphysics. The principle of tolerance (according to which everyone is free to build up his own form of language as he wishes) had been adopted near the end of 1932, at a time when it was already obvious to Carnap that a strictly verificationist criterion of meaning was inadequate. He therefore considered a variety of empiricisms and a variety of choices for the language of science. As Carnap put it, "there are many different possibilities in framing an empiricist language" and, correspondingly, several <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> the criterion of meaning.

40|$|International air {{transport}} is at a crossroads. The aviation industry’s {{center of gravity}} has moved toward the East, with main hubs in the Gulf region and ever-increasing passenger markets located in Asia. Long-haul inter-continental low-cost-carriers have emerged. Global alliances and their effects on competition have come into question. These outcomes {{have led to a}} reignited interest in the issue <b>of</b> <b>liberalization</b> in aviation: European regulators now need to balance concerns about fair competition with their own decades-long push for the multilateral <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> the aviation industry. The European Union has been at the forefront <b>of</b> market <b>liberalization</b> in international {{air transport}} for the last few decades, relaxing the conditions of market access such as airline designation, fare setting, and flight frequencies. After deregulating its domestic market in the 1990 s, in 2005 the EU began exporting its open market policies to its neighbors and key strategic partners through comprehensive aviation liberalization packages. With this pioneering approach, individual countries handed over the economic regulation of their international air markets to regional bodies like the EU. This ushered in the era of a potential multilateral approach for achieving global air transport market liberalization.

40|$|This chapter interrogates the {{capacity}} of radio stations in three countries of the African Great Lakes region (Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi and Rwanda) to act as influential independent stakeholders in the postconflict public debate. The three countries are all former Belgian colonies and have been historically, economically and culturally interconnected for decades. During the past twenty years, Burundi, Rwanda and the DRC have experienced varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> the political space {{as well as the}} media landscape after decades of single-party rule and state monopoly on the media. Moreover, these three countries have also undergone armed conflicts in which some journalists and media agencies have been key players. Radio stations especially have experienced significant growth in recent years and radio broadcasting in these postconflict environments is clearly superseding print and television media, both perceived as elitist and urban-based. The chapter first presents an overview of the radio broadcasting landscape in the three countries. After examining the obstacles that radio stations face in that environment, it then analyzes a peculiar dynamic that has spread in recent years among radio stations in the three countries, known as “media synergy. ” These initiatives, aimed at sharing human and material resources between media outlets and at producing joint contents, were established during elections as the stations were trying to overcome the obstacles they faced. Finally, the chapter interrogates the sustainability and professional autonomy of some of the main local radio stations in the three Great Lakes countries, which have become financially dependent on Western donors. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberalization</b> in OECD {{electricity}} markets varies considerably across countries. Commonly, {{these differences are}} explained by diverging economic developments, varying political systems and preferences and industrial interference. The empirical estimations reported in this paper, however, suggest another reason: The more a step towards full competition in the electricity sector reduces the tax revenues generated by this industry, the less likely is its implementation. We conjecture that this relationship is especially caused by the persistent financial dependency of regulatory decision-makers on governments, which results in authorities that shrink from reforms which reduce the executive’s and hence their own financial ressources. In this case, a clear delineation of a regulator’s budgetary interests from its regulatory goals is vital to achieve the latter. JEL-classification: Keywords...|$|E
