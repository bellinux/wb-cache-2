By adding a field plate to the drain electrode, a dramatic increase in the dynamic ON-resistance dynR (mathon) was identified. The dispersion effect is correlated with the high electric field below the drain field plate (DFP), the onset of which is caused by the full electron depletion from both the channel and the GaN cap layer. We show that the electron distribution is modified by the passivation method, backside bias, or surface charges and, hence, shifts the onset voltage of the trapping effect. Trapped electrons underneath the DFP are thought to be responsible for the measured rise of the dynR (mathon). With the introduction of an extended ohmic drain contact, the influence of a metallization overhang at the <b>drain</b> <b>edge</b> can be suppressed.

40|$|In {{order to}} scale CMOS devices to smaller {{dimensions}} while maintaining good {{control over the}} short-channel effect, the gate oxide thickness needs to be reduced in close proportion to the channel length [1]. With the reduction of oxide thickness, the gate-induced drain leakage (GIDL) increases exponentially by high gate-to-drain electric field due to an imperfect optimization of the gate-to-drain structure [2]. To achieve good retention time property in DRAM, low cell leakage current is essential [3], [4]. We propose the source/drain-to-gate nonoverlap Nano-CMOS structure and optimize DRAM cell transistor structure. We show GIDL can be suppressed in this structure by adjusting nonoverlap region to reduce drain-to-gate electric field. To reduce the GIDL current, we simulated the nonoverlap source/drain-to-gate structure shown in Fig. 1 using SILVACO. In this structure, the wide nonoverlap region formed by spacer suppresses the electric field in the <b>drain</b> <b>edge.</b> Using the oxide spacer, the nonoverlap length (Lno) is adjusted.

40|$|Advanced MOSFETs are non-uniformly doped as {{a result}} of complex process flow. Therefore, one of the key factors to model {{threshold}} voltage accurately is to model its non-uniform doping profile. Currently, there are many Vth models [1 - 6] that are able to model the vertical non-uniform doping profile of MOSFET. However, all the Vth models for lateral non-uniform doping profile resulting in Reverse Short Channel Effect (RSCE) are empirical [7 - 12], which are normally modeled by exponential functions. In this paper, a physically-derived effective channel-doping model for two-dimensional profile is proposed. The model has successfully transformed both the vertical and horizontal non-uniform doping profiles into an effective value, which can model the RSCE accurately. The basis of the model is by assuming two Gaussian pile-up profiles at the source and <b>drain</b> <b>edge</b> of the MOS device, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Two parameters are used to characterize the lateral Gaussian profiles.

Parasitic edge transistors of oxide trench isolated N-MOSFETs and Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) N-MOSFETs, fabricated using Selective Epitaxial Growth/Epitaxial Lateral Overgrowth (SEG/ELO) technology, are caused by the boron out-diffusion during high temperature process steps. Employing a simple ammonia nitridation of the field oxide before the epitaxial growth step, boron out-diffusion into the surrounding oxide was suppressed. The parasitic edge transistors in both oxide trench isolated SEG N-MOSFETs and ELO-SOI N-MOSFETs were eliminated. ^ A unique and simple method is demonstrated for characterizing the electrical impact of a single stacking fault on Fully Depleted Thin-Film SOI MOSFETs.

40|$|Gallium nitride based {{transistors}} {{will make}} up {{a large portion of}} the power electronics and the microwave electronics sectors in the very near future, replacing traditional materials such as silicon (Si) and gallium arsenide (GaAs). The work in this thesis focuses on AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) in particular, with the aim of gaining the maximum potential out of them with regards to breakdown voltage. GaN based devices are able to breakdown at higher voltages compared to Si or GaAs due to its wider band gap (3. 4 eV compared to 1. 1 eV and 1. 4 eV respectively) and although a lot of work has been invested into these devices over the last two decades or so, their full potential has yet to be realised and new solutions are still sought to provide a complete engineering solution which will make them competitive and commercially viable. One of the main obstacles is the high electric fields generated at the drain side of the gate which have prevented these devices from reaching their theoretical breakdown fileld of around 300 V/um. In an attempt to overcome this, several approaches have been investigated in this thesis including metal insulator semiconductor HEMTs (MIS-HEMTs), `gate overlapping' HEMTs, where the gate partially overlaps the source and drain contacts and finally a device employing a Schottky source and a Schottky drain contact. The results given show that a MIS-HEMT can have a substantially larger breakdown voltage compared to a Schottky gate HEMT which is clarified through qualitative simulated electric field work and experimental work. Further, the MIS-HEMT shows a high breakdown field of about 87 V/um when a Schottky drain contact is incorporated. The gate overlapping HEMTs attempts to mitigate completely the large electric field found at the <b>drain</b> <b>edge</b> of the gate. Simulated and experimental results are given for this device concept and reveal that the large electric field peak is indeed removed, however, low breakdown voltages are still incurred due to the closeness of the gate edge to the drain contact.

40|$|Abstract Gallium nitride based high {{electron}} mobility transistors (HEMTs) are excellent candidates for high frequency and power applications. Due to high breakdown field, mobility, saturation velocity and thermal conductivity of GaN-based materials, HEMTs may operate at voltage and temperature ranges far beyond conventional semiconductor as Si, GaAs or InP; {{they also have}} a Baliga figure of merit many times higher and a lower resistance and hence reduced switching times and losses leading to improved effciency. Still, they are affected by (i) parasitics phenomena and (ii) reliability issues: defects and dislocations may induce high leakage currents, kink effect and soft breakdown, while, in the reliability field, hot electrons, high electric fields and power are still under investigation. In {{the first part of this}} work parasitics have been investigated. In particular, great interest has been devoted to trapping phenomena, which mainly influence the on-resistance (Ron); transient and pulsed measurements help to extrapolate useful information as location in the epilayer structure, activation energy and cross section of the traps responsible of the Ron collapse; we also studied leakage phenomena, proving that both the phenomena can be significantly reduced with the introduction of a AlGaN back-barrier layer which, thanks to the additional band offset that prevents electrons from traveling and being trapped deep into the buffer. Finally, kink effect has been characterized; main results show it becomes almost negligible when a capping layer is grown over the AlGaN barrier and a semi-insulating substrate is used. An extensive analysis of the electrical and optical properties of HEMTs biased in a non-destructive breakdown regime is the main topic of the second part. HEMTs can reach a sustainable breakdown condition with a Vg lower than the pinch-off voltage. Phenomena are mainly activated by two mechanisms, depending on the gate voltage applied: when Vg is close to the pinch-off, space charge injection of electrons occurs and a parasitic path between source and drain is formed; if a more negative voltage is applied, breakdown occurs due to electrons injection through the gate. Tests reveal that HEMTs can emit a weak electroluminescence (EL) signal: this is localized at the edge of the gate when a low current is owing; it shifts to <b>drain</b> <b>edge</b> and the intensity reaches its maximum at higher Id when breakdown conditions are met. Moreover, the breakdown has a non-monotonic dependence from the temperature; this result confirms that two different mechanisms jointly interact at high voltage levels, one dominating on the other depending on the thermal condition. Single-heterostructure (SH) has a soft breakdown due to a poor ability to confine electrons into the channel and the consequent punch-through, independently from the gate to drain distance (Lgd). Many approaches have been successfully tested in order to improve the breakdown voltage (BV) : GaN buffer doped with C or Fe, application of double-heterostructure (DH) epitaxy and devices with an AlGaN back-barrier grown on a doped buffer. These solution efficiently increase the BV, which also becomes dependent from Lgd distance with a slope that ranges from 30 V/um to 50 V/um. The third part deals with reliability issues. Results of accelerated life tests show that in SH devices a quick degradation of the electrical properties is visible in off-state even at low drain voltage biasing condition: the punch-through leakage path increases defects formation, causing a strong device degradation even in short life tests. DH devices present improved reliability due likely to (i) lower leakage currents (ii) less sub-surface DIBL (iii) higher breakdown values. The last section is devoted to the NPI Project. The purpose of the third placement has been the analysis of the performances and of the reliability behavior of GH 25 technology. DC measurements show that technology process is quite mature: low off-state and leakage currents, good output current and very few devices with non-standard behavior. Still, the devices suffer from kink effect as confirmed by pulsed measurements; moreover, pulsed characterization enlightens a consistent trapping phenomena, the current collapse being 30...|$|E
