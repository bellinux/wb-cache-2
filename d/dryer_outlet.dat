40|$|Recovery {{rates of}} certain polar and {{non-polar}} {{volatile organic compounds}} were evaluated for bias {{associated with the use}} of a Nafion® dryer in the analyses of environmental samples. Analyses of dryer inlet verses <b>dryer</b> <b>outlet</b> concentrations of specific compounds were used to assess the extent of Nafion® bias. A select group of 22 polar and 6 non-polar compounds, as well as historical data from other authors was used to develop a stepwise multiple regression model to aid in predicting recovery rates. Specific compound physical parameters used in this model include water solubility, hydrogen bonding capacity, and dipole moment. The overall R squared or predictive value of this model is 0. 7885. Typical recovery rates of non-polar and extremely polar compounds are 100 % and < 10 % respectively.

50|$|Presence {{of water}} in {{hydrogen}} has to be avoided, as it causes deterioration to hydrogen cooling properties, corrosion of the generator parts, arcing in the high voltage windings, and reduces the lifetime of the generator. A desiccant-based dryer is usually included in the gas circulation loop, typically with a moisture probe in the <b>dryer's</b> <b>outlet,</b> sometimes also in its inlet. Presence of moisture is also an indirect evidence for air leaking into the generator compartment. Another option is optimizing the hydrogen scavenging, so the dew point is kept within the generator manufacturer specifications. The water is usually introduced into the generator atmosphere as an impurity in the turbine oil; another route is via leaks in water cooling systems.|$|R
40|$|Cassava (Manihot esculenta) is {{the most}} {{important}} staple food in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the shelf-life of the crop is short and, for this reason, the roots are usually processed into more stable products like cassava flour by village-based enterprises. Most of these enterprises use small-scale locally built pneumatic dryers, but such dryers still need further development, so the objective of this research was to improve their energy performance. Experiments were conducted at two cassava processing centres, one in Tanzania and one in Nigeria. Sensors were installed on the dryers, product samples were collected and the mass and energy balance of the equipment analysed, allowing the dryers' minimum air mass flow rates to be calculated. The air mass flow rates of both dryers were then reduced to a level approximating the minimum value. In Tanzania, the air mass flow rate of the dryer was reduced by 24 %, while in Nigeria it was reduced by 14 %. In both locations, the modifications decreased the dryers' heat input without jeopardising evaporation rates, and so not affecting the final moisture content of the dry products. Air temperatures at the <b>dryer</b> <b>outlets</b> decreased and relative humidity increased, while enthalpy remained unchanged. The energy required to evaporate 1 kg of water decreased by 20 % in Tanzania and by 13 % in Nigeria. The modification also improved energy efficiency by 25 % in Tanzania and by 14 % in Nigeria. However, in Nigeria, where yellow cassava flour was being used, the dryer modifications resulted in greater product colour losses. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|As a drying system, {{heat pump}} drying with {{appropriate}} configuration is potential to safe energy. The {{objective of this}} research was to develop vapor compression heat pump system for rough rice drying and to obtain low energy consumption from several system configurations. Therefore, the model of vapor compression heat pump system was designed in which its configuration was modifiable. The result showed that the ratio of specific moisture extraction rate which calculated mechanic and thermal consumption (SMERTot) upon resistive heating dryer for those several configurations was 159 – 329 %. The open cycle heat pump drying method with intermittent operation produced the highest specific moisture extraction rate which only calculated thermal energy (SMERT) and SMERTot at 7. 06 and 5. 06 kg/kWh, respectively. Intermittent operation did not much influence drying rate but significantly reduced energy consumption. Ambient air inlet which placed before evaporator and condenser on a closed cycle could produce different SMERTot i. e. 4. 01 dan 3. 07 kg/kWh respectively. The utilization of ambient air through forced convection in heat exchanger could increase SMERTot, while the utilization of air flow the <b>dryer</b> from <b>outlet</b> could reduce SMERTot...|$|R
40|$|In {{fiber board}} industry, the {{moisture}} content (the moisture level) of fiber, {{perhaps the most}} critical parameter of fiber board manufacturing, works as the medium of heat transfer across the fiber mat while subjected to pressing in the hot press. The high moisture content splits (delaminates) the wood panel when decompressing due {{to the release of}} high steam pressure develops inside it where as the low moisture content split the panel as a result of low heat transfer causing a low level curing of resin inside the panel. So controlling moisture is the most critical issue of the wood refiner operators which is a highly skill job that cannot be easily absorbed until having long time practice on it. The fiber moisture content is controlled inside the dryer by adjusting the <b>dryer</b> <b>outlet</b> temperature set point. This set point is automatically maintained by the valve position of the steam PRV (Pressure Regulating Valve) of the heat exchanger, the only energy source of the dryer. In very cool climate conditions the air and the environment get cold where the <b>dryer</b> <b>outlet</b> temperature cannot reach the required set point even though the PRV is at its 100 % open condition. In 100 % valve open condition the system is supplied with maximum heat energy that can be given {{and the only way to}} further increase the outlet temperature is to make a change in the process. This change is done by using three parameters namely the blow valve position, the refiner feed screw speed and the differential pressure. The mistakes in putting the correct set points and forgetting to put it on right time are human errors usually happen. This makes a heavy loss in the profit and restricts the consistency of the process. To avoid this problem, the process of controlling moisture is fully automated with the four parameters mentioned, using a cascaded PID system coupled with a multistage controller. The cascaded PID takes moisture as the reference set point that controls the outlet temperature and this in turn controls the steam PRV. At the time when the PRV is at 100 % open position the other three parameters work together as a multi stage controller in increasing the outlet temperature...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{washable}} baghouses for fines {{collection in}} milk powder plants has been investigated. The main {{aim of this}} study was to increase the fundamental understanding of both operation and design of washable baghouses for application in milk powder plants. This work has focussed on the industrial scale. Industrial plant operating data has been collected, plant designs compared and analyses conducted on powder produced at the industrial scale. The amount of powder that becomes fines, the small size fraction of powder entrained in spray <b>dryer</b> <b>outlet</b> air streams, has been shown to be significantly greater than the traditionally vague estimate of 10 % to 20 %. The ratio of fines flows to total powder flows ranged from 49 ± 8 % to 86 ± 2 % depending on the powder type and plant operating conditions. A simple yet reliable method was developed to quantify fines flows based on measured powder size distributions of samples taken from around the plant. These estimates were supported by readings from an online optical scintillation instrument, which was shown to be capable of measuring fines flows at concentrations approximately four times the supposed maximum stated by the instrument’s manufacturer. Observations in another part of this work supported previous Fonterra observations showing that the amount of bulk fat in skim milk powder (SMP) has a large influence on the baghouse differential pressure. Fines flows measured by the optical scintillation instrument and analysis of other plant operating data showed that a change in bulk fat in SMP does not appear to cause any change in fines concentration. Observations of the surface of SMP by scanning electron microscopy, and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, both showed that fat is over-represented on the surface of the particles, and that only small increases in the bulk fat content are required to cause large increases in the surface fat coverage. It is hypothesised that increased fat on the surface of particles increases the clumping of SMP before deposition on the bags. Consequently, the powder forms more porous cakes and is less likely to penetrate into the interior of the filter bags, which also makes it easier to pulse clean powder from the filter bags. Therefore, the baghouse differential pressure is reduced. The design of pulse-jet baghouses from the literature was found to rely heavily on the authors past experience and approach, giving rise to large variation in recommended values of the key design parameters. A procedure for determining the optimal combination of these parameters was developed. This procedure showed that the main Fonterra washable baghouses are far from optimal because of their high air-to-cloth ratios, long bags and high elutriation and annular velocities. This procedure also showed that the Fonterra vibrating fluid bed washable baghouses are much closer to the optimum, which is the probable reason these washable baghouses have had almost no operational issues. Observations of the movement of the bags from below showed significant movement for bags near the inlet of the baghouse, indicating that this was the probable cause of the high bag damage in this zone. It is suggested that increasing the outer gap (distance between the baghouse wall and the bag on the edge of the bag bundle) be investigated further in an attempt to slow the annular velocity around the edge of the bag bundle and reduce bag movement. It is also recommended that stainless steel inspection hatches installed in the wall of a baghouse for this research, be included in all current and future washable baghouses because use of these hatches reduced the overall clean-in-place turn around time by 20 %. Computational fluid dynamics simulations of the air flow patterns within the Clandeboye Dryer 2 chamber were carried out using a commercial code CFX 10. 0. These simulations are possibly the first to include the influence of a spray dryer’s internal fluid bed airflow on the flow patterns within a spray dryer. As expected, the simulations showed the main air jet oscillated and precessed about the central axis with no apparent distinct frequency. In turn, the recirculation zones between the main jet and the chamber walls fluctuated in size. Different fluid bed flows within the industrial range had only a local influence on the air only flow field by reducing the length of the main jet. A different outlet boundary condition (including a flow resistance representing the baghouse) also appeared to have little influence on the overall flow field. Good agreement was found between the movements of the main jet via simulations and from telltale tufts installed in the plant dryer. This supported other indications that the simulations were an accurate representation of the actual flows. It was concluded that this project achieved its main aim of improving the fundamental understanding of washable baghouse operation and design, especially for application in milk powder plants. Also this project, as well as a change in production schedules, has helped to reduce downtime associated with the washable baghouses in the Fonterra Clandeboye Dryer 2 plant by an estimated 50 hours per annum...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{an approach to}} compute dryer energy efficiency using air flowrate step responses and establish a link between drying energy efficiency and process controllability. The approach {{is based on the}} temperature drop between the <b>dryer</b> inlet and <b>outlet</b> air under adiabatic conditions and so decouples water evaporation from heat loss and product heating effects on dryer temperature drop. As such, the computation is accurate even for dryers with significant heat losses where the traditional use of actual temperature drop measurements is grossly inaccurate. The approach is tested and verified on two experimental case studies involving significant heat losses: the first, a continuous fluidized-bed dryer (from literature); the second, a conventional and zeolite wheel-assisted batch dryer designed in the current study. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

Factorial designs were employed in the assays to evaluate the operating conditions of the spray <b>dryer</b> (inlet and <b>outlet</b> temperatures and flow rate) and the inclusion of drying aid agents (maltodextrin and calcium carbonate). The spray drying showed the best results with air inlet temperature of 190 ºC, outlet temperature of 90 ºC, flow rate of 30 L·h- 1 including 10 % maltodextrin (mass) in the liquid feed as a drying aid. The final powder recovery was higher than 90 % and the physical, chemical and microbiological analyses met the Brazilian legal standards. ...|$|R
40|$|Rotary dryers are {{commonly}} used in the food and mineral processing industries for drying granular or particulate solids due to their simplicity, low cost and versatility compared to other dryers. The co-current industrial rotary dryer (MMG, Karumba) {{examined in this study}} is used in drying zinc and lead concentrate. The dryer is 22. 2 metres long with a diameter of 3. 9 metres. The slope and the typical rotational speed of the dryer are 4 degrees and 3 rpm respectively. The dryer has both unflighted and flighted sections with different flight configurations. Operational issues associated with the dryer that lead to the requirement for a dynamic model of the dryer include issues such as high fuel consumption and the build-up of scale on the internal surfaces. In order to operate an optimum dryer, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms occurring within the dryer. The important transport mechanisms that govern the performance of rotary dryers are: solids transportation, heat, and mass transfer. Studies have shown that the knowledge of the solid transport is important to solve the heat and mass transfer differential equations that describe completely the temperature and moisture content profiles along the dryer for both solid and gas phases. Solid transport within the dryer can be characterised through the solid residence time distribution, which is the distribution of times taken for the solids to travel through the dryer. Solid residence time distribution can be determined experimentally. The most common experimental approach is to introduce tracer at the inlet and monitor tracer concentration at the outlet as a function time. Several modelling approaches have been taken to determine the residence time and the residence time distribution and these approaches have varied from empirical correlations to compartment modelling. In many of these approaches, loading state, residence time and operational feed rates are strongly linked. The loading state also influences the effectiveness of particle to gas heat and mass transfer as well as the residence time distribution of solids through the dryer. There are three potential degrees of loading in a rotary dryer namely under-loaded, design loaded and overloaded. However, most industrial rotary dryers are operated at under-loaded or overloaded, which results into poor efficiency of the dryer and the optimal economics of the dryer will not be achieved. As such, accurate estimation of the design load is critical to the optimal performance of flighted rotary dryers and is an important characteristic of flighted rotary dryer models. To experimentally characterise MMG rotary dryer, industrial and laboratory experiments were undertaken. The industrial experiments included residence time distributions (RTD), shell temperature measurements, spatial sampling of the solids along the length of dryer, moisture content analysis and Process Information (PI) data collection. Residence time distribution experiments were carried out by injecting lithium chloride as tracer at the inlet of the <b>dryer</b> while sampling <b>outlet</b> solids over a period of time. Zinc concentrate properties such as dynamic angle of repose, bulk density and particle size were also determined. A series of different experiments were undertaken to examine the effect of speed and loading. Flight loading experiments were carried out at pilot scale to determine the effect of moisture content and rotational speed on dryer design loadings and to facilitate accurate determination of model parameters. The flight holdup experiments involved taking photographs of the crosssectional area of the dryer. An image analysis technique was developed to estimate the amount of material within the flights and in the airborne phase. The analysis involved developing a combined ImageJ thresholding process and in-house MATLAB code to estimate the cross-sectional area of material within the flight. The suitability of the developed methodology was established. In addition, saturation of both the airborne and upper drum flight-borne solids was observed. To select an appropriate geometrically derived design load model, comparison of existing design load models from the literature was undertaken. The proportion of airborne to flight-borne solids within the drum was characterised through a combination of photographic analysis coupled with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation. In particular, solid volume fractions of the airborne solids were characterised using a CFD technique based on the Eulerian-Eulerian approach. The suitability of using geometric models of flight unloading to predict these proportions in a design loaded dryer were discussed and a modified version of Baker's (1988) design load model was proposed. A multiscale dynamic mass and energy process model was developed and validated for the dryer in order to characterise the performance of MMG rotary dryer. The mass and energy balance equations involved ordinary differential equations for describing the flighted sections and partial differential equations for modelling the unflighted sections. Solids in unflighted sections were modelled as the axially-dispersed plug flow system. In the flighted sections, the solids were modelled using a compartment modelling approach involving well-mixed tanks (Sheehan et al., 2005). The gas phase was modelled as a plug flow system. Simulations were undertaken using gPROMS (process modelling software). As much as possible, model coefficients were determined using geometric modelling based on material properties and dryer operational conditions. The use of this approach is termed a pseudo-physical compartment model. The solid transport model was validated using full scale residence time distribution at different experimental conditions. The model results predicted well the effect of rotational speed, internal diameter and solid feed rate. Estimated parameters included the kilning velocity, axial dispersed coefficient and area correction factors. The validation of the energy balances was based on Process Information (PI), experimental residence time distribution and moisture content data of the studied dryer. Model parameters involving the surface area in contact with the incoming gas data were manipulated to fit experimental moisture content. The gas and solid temperature profiles were also predicted, which provide a firm basis upon which additional studies may be undertaken. Gas inlet temperature was identified as the most suitable manipulated variable for the dryer with clean internal condition. However, to achieve desired product quality within a scaled dryer, the study suggested the solid feed rate should be reduced so as to achieve optimum gas-solid interaction. To address the high fuel consumption associated with the dryer, the study proposed externally lagging of the dryer and reduction in the gas inlet temperature to meet the desired product quality...|$|R
