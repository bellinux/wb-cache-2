40|$|We {{study the}} role of {{vertical}} structure in determining <b>generating</b> <b>capacities</b> and retail prices in the electricity industry. Allowing for uncertain demand, we compare three market configurations: (i) integrated monopoly, (ii) integrated duopoly with wholesale trade, and (iii) separated duopoly with wholesale trade. We find that equilibrium capacities and retail prices are such that welfare is highest (lowest) under separated (integrated) duopoly. The driving force behind this result is the risk of rent extraction faced by competing integrated generators on the wholesale market. Our analysis suggests that vertical structure {{plays an important role}} in determining <b>generating</b> <b>capacities</b> and retail prices...|$|R

5|$|The A Station {{generated}} electricity {{using three}} turbo alternators; two 69 megawatt (MW) Metropolitan-Vickers British Thomson-Houston sets, and one 105MW Metropolitan-Vickers set, totalling 243MW. At {{the time of}} its commissioning, the 105MW generating set was the largest in Europe. The B Station also had three turbo alternators, all made by Metropolitan-Vickers. This consisted of two units which used 16MW high-pressure units exhausting to a 78MW and associated with a 6MW house alternator, giving these units a total rating of 100MW. The third unit consisted of a 66MW machine associated with a 6MW house alternator, giving the unit a rating of 72MW. Combined, these gave the B station a <b>generating</b> <b>capacity</b> of 260MW, making the site's <b>generating</b> <b>capacity</b> 503MW. All of the station's boilers were made by Babcock & Wilcox, fuelled by pulverised coal from pulverisers also built by Babcock & Wilcox. There were nine boilers in the A station and six in the B station. The B station's boilers were the largest ever built in the UK at that time. The B station also had the highest thermal efficiency of any power station in the country for the first twelve years of its operation.|$|E
5|$|The British {{demand for}} {{electricity}} increased after the Second World War. In the North East of England {{this led to}} the expansion of existing power stations at Dunston and Billingham in the late 1940s, the two new Stella power stations, and the construction of two more large stations built at Blyth later in the 1960s. This new <b>generating</b> <b>capacity</b> quickly met the demand for power. The British Electricity Authority were granted permission to construct the Stella North and Stella South power stations in 1951. The two stations were originally projected to cost around £15,000,000.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Second World War, {{construction}} {{began on}} the second phase, the B Station. The station came into operation gradually between 1953 and 1955. It was nearly identical to the A Station from the outside and was constructed directly to its east as a mirror to it, which gave the power station its now familiar four-chimney layout. The construction of the B Station brought the site's <b>generating</b> <b>capacity</b> up to 509 megawatts (MW), making it the third largest generating site in the UK at the time, providing a fifth of London's electricity needs (with the remainder supplied by 28 smaller stations). It was also the most thermally efficient power station in the world when it opened.|$|E
40|$|Security {{of energy}} supply {{is a key}} to social and {{economic}} development of society. Liberalization of power market has brought changes in the process of decision making regarding new investments in power system and certain concerns arise related to adequacy of the present investments. Taking into consideration that significant amount of <b>generating</b> <b>capacities</b> in Croatian power system will be shut down in the following years, it will be even more challenging to satisfy a growing demand. Energy saved through energy efficiency measures can be considered an alternative source of energy. Within this thesis a question has been answered whether it is more economically feasible to invest public money in new <b>generating</b> <b>capacities</b> or to invest it in large-scale energy efficiency improvements. The answer has been provided through calculating levelized cost of electricity of three different electricity generating options and comparing it to energy saving costs of currently proposed energy efficiency measures. Furthermore, the problem of peaking capacity and fixed costs recovery has been analyzed. It has been concluded that a certain capacity mechanism is needed in order to ensure investment costs recovery and stimulate investments. </p...|$|R
