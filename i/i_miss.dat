500|$|By late 1985, Rangel {{was in a}} six-person race {{to become}} the next House Majority Whip, the third-highest ranked {{position}} in the House {{and for the first time}} up for election by the members rather than appointment by the Speaker.

However, in December 1986, Coelho defeated Rangel in the whip election, 167–78.

[...] On April 26, 2007, Ivan Kane, the owner of Los Angeles nightclub Forty Deuce, told E! News that Spears had pulled out of a surprise performance at the venue the previous night. Kane stated that during rehearsal, she was [...] "looking very hot, with four backup dancers and [...] sang three songs. They ran through the set several times, the choreography was smokin', and she sounded great." [...] Marc Malkin of E! News said that Spears thought she might need more time to prepare. He also reported that she was planning to tour House of Blues venues in the United States. Spears wanted to keep the rehearsals a secret, and did not even inform the owners of the different dance studios the reason for the preparation. In late April 2007, a marquee reading [...] "The M+M's" [...] appeared at the House of Blues in San Diego. Several gossip websites and local media sources identified the act as Spears, prompting the show to quickly sell out. The title, [...] "M+M's" [...] code name was claimed to be Mother (after having two children) and Miss (after being divorced). On May 1, 2007, a front-page story on The San Diego Union-Tribune fueled the speculation. The same day, the doors opened at 19:00 PST (03:00 UTC), and Spears took the stage at 22:00 PST (06:00 UTC). It marked the first time Spears was on stage since her knee injury caused The Onyx Hotel Tour to be canceled in June 2004.|$|E

[...] Similarly, Television Blend's Jesse Carp wrote that the plot shows [...] "essentially what is wrong with the show and why I stopped watching. Because of the endless amount of material needed to keep a series running for twenty three years, they have to resort to outlandish plots and endless cameos to stay interesting.
