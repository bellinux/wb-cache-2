50|$|Park golf uses {{terminology}} {{similar to}} golf, utilizing {{words such as}} par, bogey, eagle and double eagle. To formally {{play a game of}} Park Golf, two to four participants are crucial to form one group. Order is decided by <b>drawing</b> <b>rods</b> that are generally provided by the course management {{at the beginning of each}} course. Once initial shooting order is determined, the group decides which course to play on as most parks have 2-4 courses, one course being 9 holes. Multiple courses can be played. Holes can be shot in any order, as long as all holes are played eventually. This occurs most commonly due to a quick group advancing on a slower group of park golfers.|$|R

40|$|The article {{presents}} an accelerated method for fatigue limit calculation which {{makes use of}} constant temperature increase rate observed in the middle time interval of specimen fatigue loading. The examination was performed on specimens prepared from <b>drawn</b> <b>rods</b> made of corrosion resistant austenitic steel X 5 CrNi 18 - 10 (1. 4301) subjected to rotating bending. For comparison purposes, the fatigue limit was also calculated {{with the aid of}} the Staircase method, using 30 specimens and assuming the base number of cycles equal to 10 · 106. Three specimens were used for accelerated examination during which their temperature was measured with the aid of the thermographic camera CEDIP Silver 420 M (FLIR SC 5200). The applied loads were gradually increased until specimen damage took place. Based on the analysis of temperature changes during specimen loading, the average rate of temperature increase at successive loading stages was assessed. The obtained results were then approximated using the 2 -nd order curve and its minimal value was assumed as corresponding to the fatigue limit. The performed statistic test has revealed that the fatigue limit calculated in the above way does not differ substantially from that determined using the Staircase method...|$|R

Internal damage, {{as a function of}} cold work, was determined using precision density measurements. Nitrogen was observed to have the greatest effect on the ductility of low carbon steel. Interstitial nitrogen causes internal damage, which results in wire breaks. The mobility of nitrogen increases with temperature, which could account for the increased probability of wire breaks at high drawing speeds...|$|R

50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{variations}} in the process of turning the burr, the choice of which is down to personal preference. However the basic concept is that the burnishing rod is held against the edge of the scraper at a slight angle and drawn along the edge a number of times until the burr is created. One variation involves holding the rod flat {{against the side of the}} scraper for the first few passes to create a burr pointing away from the edge and this is then rolled back down by <b>drawing</b> the <b>rod</b> along perpendicular to the scraper.|$|R

40|$|A {{test was}} {{conducted}} to make {{a check on the}} yield stress of the copper spacer buttons to be used in OCH. The tested button was made from Copper no. 110, cold <b>drawn</b> <b>rod,</b> which has a documented yield stress value of 48, 000 psi. The button was put into compression with the load applied to the face of the button. The resulting deflection vs. the applied cross load was then charted with the width of the chart having a 10, 000 kg scale. While the chart speed was set at 1 cm/min, the cross head speed was set at. 05 cm/min. To find a value of Young's Modulus for the OCH button, the compression test was run again with a chart width scale of 5, 000 kg. The chart speed was set at 10 cm/min and the cross head speed at. 05 cm/min. The curve generated on the chart was linear in nature until the button reached its yield point. Here, the slope of the curve began to change, increasing over a small area until a new linear curve was established. The point at which the slope changed would be considered the yielding point of the material, but here, there was no single distinct point. Instead there was a smooth transition between the two linear portions of the curve. In order to find where the yield point would occur, two lines were drawn, representing the best fit of each of the two slopes of the curve (before and after the yield point). The intersection of these lines was taken to be the point from which the yield stress could be calculated...|$|R
50|$|Wire is made {{nowadays}} by <b>drawing</b> a <b>rod</b> {{of metal}} {{through a series}} of holes of ever-decreasing size (in a block of metal known as a die) until the desired diameter is achieved. This method was not known until about the sixth century A.D. Before then, various methods were used involving hammering on an anvil or twisting a fine strip of metal to give a hollow wire like a miniature drinking straw. Determining the techniques used largely require the use of a microscope and depend on the ancient wire having a well-preserved surface. The ready corrosion of iron, bronze and silver means that wires made of these materials are difficult to investigate. Hence the study of Gold wire in Antiquity is largely confined to the examination of wire in gold jewellery.|$|R
