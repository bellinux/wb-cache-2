The initial <b>frictioning</b> phase can be studied with analytical contact models to identify different frictional regimes and relate them to actual friction coefficient experiments, which in turn will be used in process parameters selection and numerical modelling. The use of ANNs for the same phase can help in the prediction of the coefficient of friction as well. For the steady state extrusion phase of the process material flow analytical models may predict the strain rates that material experiences at and near the welding interface, which directly influences localized yield and subsequent plastic material flow.

Gua sha, therapeutic surface <b>frictioning</b> that intentionally raises transitory petechiae and ecchymosis, is a traditional East Asian healing technique.

Modern studies confirm a thermoregulatory function involving surface microcirculation, wherein increased skin blood flow in subpapillary tissue layers effectively conducts away heat [39, 40]. Our hypothesis assumes that increased blood circulation is stimulated in order to improve the metabolism and blood flow of the treated structures. The significant thermometer temperature increases as well as our thermography findings support this notion.|$|E
