That's all I do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all.|$|E

500|$|Writing for NDTV, Anupama Chopra {{gave the}} film 2 out of 5, criticising the slow {{screenplay}} and artificial characters who [...] "are {{supposed to be}} unemployed, lonely, and desperately sad, but they always look like they've {{stepped out of the}} pages of a fashion magazine. Which could have been overlooked if there was any depth in their angst, but these two seem like spoilt <b>kids</b> <b>playing</b> suicide-suicide." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-News18 panned the film, calling it [...] "deathly boring [...] a challenge to sit through for two reasons in particular– the film has no script to speak of, and the characters are hard to sympathize with. It lacks in terms of interesting plot and consistent characterization".|$|E
500|$|Described by her biographer Wes Gehring as [...] "a free-spirited tomboy", {{the young}} Lombard was passionately {{involved}} {{in sports and}} enjoyed watching movies. At Virgil Junior High School, she participated in tennis, volleyball, and swimming, and won trophies for her achievements in athletics. At the age of 12, this hobby unexpectedly landed Lombard her first screen role. While playing baseball with friends, she {{caught the attention of}} the film director Allan Dwan, who later recalled seeing [...] "a cute-looking little tomboy... out there knocking {{the hell out of the}} other <b>kids,</b> <b>playing</b> better baseball than they were. And I needed someone of her type for this picture." [...] With the encouragement of her mother, Lombard happily took a small role in the melodrama A Perfect Crime (1921). She was on set for two days, playing the sister of Monte Blue. Dwan later commented, [...] "She ate it up".|$|E
500|$|Two {{other music}} videos from HIStory have been influential. Jackson's [...] "Stranger In Moscow" [...] music video {{influenced}} the advertising campaign for International Cricket Council Champions Trophy 2004, which featured [...] "a series of smart outdoor ads and a classy TV spot". The television commercial {{was inspired by}} [...] "Stranger In Moscow"s video where [...] "the maiden in black splash about in the rain, with <b>kids</b> <b>playing</b> cricket for company". [...] "Scream" [...] was a creative influence on other music videos such as the 1999 release of the award-winning [...] "No Scrubs" [...] by TLC. This influence was also present on the 2008 release of [...] "Shawty Get Loose" [...] by Lil Mama and Chris Brown. Reacting to the comparisons made between the videos, Mama explained, [...] "I feel honored, because {{that was one of}} the initial goals, and I feel that it was executed well", she added that the emulation was intentional and that Brown was the only logical choice to step into Michael Jackson's role.|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} was filmed in Johannesburg, South Africa, and {{was directed by}} British director Sophie Muller back-to-back with the video for [...] "Better in Time". It premiered on Lewis official website and BBC Radio 1's website on 27February2008. The video begins with the message [...] "Working to change lives across the world, in support of Sport Relief". Then, it intercuts a performance of Lewis {{in front of a}} wall and greyscale scenes: an image of a child walking on a landfill site, a funeral, a child lying in the street, and a kid sat in a traffic island. As the first chorus begins, the video continues showing scenes of poverty and AIDS issues in the country. Whilst the second verse goes, pictures of malnourished people appears. As the second chorus and the bridge elapse people crying still coming on the scene. But whereas The Tuff Session Singers start to sing the third chorus, the video begins to show images of <b>kids</b> <b>playing</b> association football and cricket. The video ends with children smiling as Lewis sings the outro of the song. It was released on the US iTunes Store on 3February2009.|$|E

2500|$|Apart {{from the}} doleful tone, Gunsmoke was {{distinct}} from other radio Westerns, as the dialogue was often slow and halting, {{and due to}} the outstanding sound effects, listeners had a nearly palpable sense of the prairie where the show was set.

John Dunning wrote, [...] "The listener heard extraneous dialogue in the background, just above the muted shouts of <b>kids</b> <b>playing</b> in an alley.

[...] He mocked the episode's stunts, commenting: [...] "There {{are so many}} post-watershed dramas on TV that do these kind of scenes properly that Phil and Grant ended up looking like two little <b>kids</b> <b>playing</b> on a building site.

2500|$|Some {{people were}} sceptical about mass citizen {{training}} in CPR; indeed, many felt {{the potential for}} harm was too great to allow such a procedure {{in the hands of}} laypersons.

Cobb recalled one resuscitation soon after the citizen training program began. [...] "In March 1973 there were these <b>kids</b> <b>playing</b> golf at Jackson Park. They came across a victim {{a quarter of a mile}} from the clubhouse." [...] The man was unconscious and not breathing; later it was confirmed that he was in ventricular fibrillation. [...] "But these kids had taken the [...] course over at the local high school. Two or three of them started doing CPR and the other kid ran off and phoned the fire department. Shortly they came with the aid car and Medic 1 screaming over the fairways." [...] Cobb concluded, [...] "They got him started up again. He survived; he's alive today [...] That was a very convincing story. I didn't mind it being written up in the Reader's Digest." ...|$|E
