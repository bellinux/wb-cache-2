In most circumstances, emergency ambulance service is organized by a local Health Trust, and may be operated directly, or contracted to private providers, such as national transportation companies, for which ambulances are <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of their business operations.

25|$|During the war two icebreakers, Silachya and Stadt Reval {{had been}} docked by unwilling {{support of a}} yard {{supervisor}} the Red Guards had found and captured. Restarting of the plant had failed largely because the power grid and machinery had been sabotaged before the supervisors had left the yard.

Work in the company was restarted when the situation returned to normal in April. The employees were taken back after each worker's role in the war was carefully investigated. As many of the company workers had taken part {{in the war in}} the Red Guards, and amount of orders had dropped, the number of personnel was significantly reduced from the level it was before the Civil War.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} ultras {{group of}} the club was Commando Ultrà Curva Sud commonly abbreviated as CUCS. This group was founded by the merger of many smaller groups and {{was considered one of}} the most historic in the history of European football. However, by the mid-1990s, CUCS had been usurped by rival factions and ultimately broke up. Since that time, the Curva Sud of the Stadio Olimpico has been controlled by more right-wing groups, including A.S. Roma Ultras, Boys and Giovinezza, among others. However, the oldest group, Fedayn, is apolitical, and politics is not the main identity of Roma, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of their overall identity. Besides ultras groups, it is believed Roma fans support the left as opposed to Lazio supporters, which are notoriously proud of their right-wing affiliation. In September 2009, the club unveiled plans to build a new 55,000-capacity stadium in Rome's western suburbs.|$|E
25|$|The {{architecture}} of Syria and the Jazira includes the widest {{variety of forms}} in the medieval Islamic world, being influenced by the surviving {{architecture of}} Late Antiquity, contemporary Christian buildings, and Islamic architecture from the east. There are some muqarnas domes of the Iraqi type, but most domes are slightly pointed hemispheres on either muqarnas pendentives or double zones of squinches and made of masonry, rather than brick and plaster. The domes cover single bay structures or are <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of larger constructions. Syrian mausoleums consist of a square stone chamber with a single entrance and a mihrab and a brick lobed dome with two rows of squinches. The dome at the Silvan Mosque, 13.5 meters wide and built from 1152-1157, has an unusual design similar to the dome added to the Friday Mosque of Isfahan in 1086-1087: once surrounded by roofless aisles on three sides, {{it may have been}} meant to be an independent structure. The congregational mosque at Kızıltepe, with its well integrated dome of about 10 meters, is the masterpiece of Artuqid architecture.|$|E

[...] He served as curate at Christ Church in Ridgewood, New Jersey, and was ordained a priest six months later. He and his wife remained at the Ridgewood parish for two years until June 1975. They then moved to New Hampshire, where Boo had grown up. Their goal was {{to start a business}} and ministry: in the winter it was called [...] "The Sign of the Dove Retreat Center" [...] and in the summer it became [...] "Pony Farm". [...] Boo still runs [...] "Pony Farm" [...] as a horse camp for children. In 1977, Robinson began working with a committee in the Diocese of New Hampshire to study human sexuality and co-authored a small manual on the subject. Robinson and Boo's first daughter, Jamee, was born in 1977, followed by a second daughter, Ella, in 1981. Robinson treasures his marriage stating, [...] "hat is inextricably tied up with having children.

2500|$|In 1864, the Holy Office {{rejected}} the branch theory, affirming {{in a letter}} written to the English bishops that the Roman Church is not <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the Catholic Church and stating that [...] "there is no other Catholic Church except that which is built on the one man, Peter." [...] In 1870, English bishops attending the First Vatican Council raised objections to the expression Sancta Romana Catholica Ecclesia ("Holy Roman Catholic Church") {{which appeared in the}} schema (the draft) of the council's Dogmatic Constitution on the Catholic Faith. These bishops proposed that the word [...] "Roman" [...] be omitted or at least that commas be inserted between the adjectives, out of concern that use of the term [...] "Roman Catholic" [...] would lend support to proponents of the branch theory. While the council overwhelmingly rejected this proposal, the text was finally modified to read [...] "Sancta Catholica Apostolica Romana Ecclesia" [...] translated into English either as [...] "the holy Catholic Apostolic Roman Church" [...] or, by separating each adjective, as [...] "the holy, catholic, apostolic and Roman Church".|$|E
2500|$|As with {{previous}} sessions, Mike Sapone acted {{as both a}} band member and co-producer, while the band were also involved in the albums production. Discussing Sapone's involvement, Lacey defined Sapone as having [...] "as much at stake with the music as we do; he's as invested in it as we are, sometimes more." [...] Accardi described Sapone as having [...] "an uncanny ability to hear something you’re doing and immediately track it to any song in his library that he stores in his brain. He'll go to it, {{show it to you}} and tell you that that’s what needs to happen. Here's the better version of it. This is what you’re trying to do and you don't even realize it." [...] Most of the songs were brought to the studio in acoustic form, sometimes as a complete song and sometimes as <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> or riff. The band would then build upon these ideas, recording everything as they worked. The band members were not limited by their normal roles within Brand New, with much instrument swapping and experimenting taking place in writing individual parts. Lacey later commented that [...] "it was such a collaborative effort with the band. Vin might write a drum part or Brian might write a guitar part or whatever. We're not really keeping tabs of how much everyone has at stake on each song".|$|E

2500|$|Hephaestion and Alexander {{grew up in}} a time where, {{according}} to Thomas R. Martin, homosexual affairs were seen as abnormal by majority Greek standards of their time. But Andrew Chugg, Robin Lane Fox and others show different views. According to Eva Cantarella, for instance, male bisexuality was widely permitted and ruled by law, and generally not frowned upon by the public {{to the extent to which}} it remained within the preset limits. The Greeks used to approach the relationships between men in a very different way from how they will be dealt with today (with exceptions of course). For the Greeks [...] "homosexuality was not an exclusive choice. Loving another man was not an option out of the norm, different, somehow deviant. It was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of life experience; it was the show of an either sentimental or sexual drive that, over a lifetime, alternated and was associated (sometimes at the very same time) with love for a woman". The pattern that same-sex love affairs followed, however, was not the same in every city-state. Some Roman and later writers, taking the Athenian pattern as their example, have tended to assume either that Alexander and Hephaestion had a sexual relationship which belonged to their adolescence, after which they left it behind, or that one of them was older, the lover (erastes) and the other was the beloved (eromenos) despite there being scarcely any direct evidence that Alexander and Hephaestion had a sexual relationship at all.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the fame}} Sonatas and Interludes earned him, and the {{connections}} he cultivated with American and European composers and musicians, Cage was quite poor. Although {{he still had}} an apartment, at 326 Monroe Street (which he occupied since around 1946) his financial situation in 1951 worsened so much that, while working on Music of Changes, he prepared a set of instructions for Tudor {{as to how to}} complete the piece in the event of his death. Nevertheless, Cage managed to survive and maintained an active artistic life, giving lectures, performances, etc. In 1952–53 he completed another mammoth project—the Williams Mix, a piece of tape music, which Earle Brown helped to put together. Also in 1952, Cage composed the piece that became his best-known and most controversial creation: 4′33″. The score instructs the performer not to play the instrument during the entire duration of the piece—four minutes, thirty-three seconds—and is meant to be perceived as consisting of the sounds of the environment that the listeners hear while it is performed. Cage conceived [...] "a silent piece" [...] years earlier, but was reluctant to write it down; and indeed, the premiere (given by Tudor on August 29, 1952 at Woodstock, New York) caused an uproar in the audience. The reaction to 4′33″ was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the larger picture: on the whole, it was the adoption of chance procedures that had disastrous consequences for Cage's reputation. The press, which used to react favorably to earlier percussion and prepared piano music, ignored his new works, and many valuable friendships and connections were lost. Pierre Boulez, who used to promote Cage's work in Europe, was opposed to Cage's use of chance, and so were other composers who came to prominence during the 1950s, e.g. Karlheinz Stockhausen and Iannis Xenakis.|$|E
