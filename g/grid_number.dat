2500|$|Both David Cram and Michael Rossi {{were interviewed}} by {{investigators}} on December 20. Rossi {{had agreed to}} be interviewed in relation to his possible links with John Szyc (whose vehicle investigators had established he drove) {{as well as the}} disappearance of Robert Piest. When questioned by Detective Joseph R. Kozenczak as to where he believed Gacy had placed Piest's body, Rossi replied: [...] "In the crawl space; he could have put him in the crawl space." [...] A polygraph test conducted upon the youth showed his responses to questions to be inconclusive; however, upon his agreeing to a subsequent visual test in which a map of Cook County was divided into 12 grid sections numbered 1 to 12, with Gacy's home marked in the fourth grid section, Kozenczak noted an extreme response in Rossi's blood pressure when asked: [...] "Is the body of Robert Piest buried in <b>grid</b> <b>number</b> 4?" [...] Upon hearing this question, Rossi refused to continue the polygraph questioning, although he did discuss further his digging trenches in the crawl space and remarked upon Gacy's insistence that he not deviate from where he was instructed to dig.|$|E

50|$|In 1995, a GT2 class {{specification}} Eclipse GSX {{was entered}} into the annual 24 Hours of Daytona endurance race. It was placed on <b>grid</b> <b>number</b> 74, at the very back, which was also last place. Not only did it manage to get a near top twenty finish (24th overall), it completed the race without any issues. It nearly set a new record as well, passing a total of 50 cars. In 1998, it entered the race again but was now in a lower specification class (GT3/GTS3) It completed the race with no issues and once more placed a 24th final result. In 1999, the Eclipse made its final appearance in the race, achieving a 39th place, after posting 455 laps. The name of the team was Spirit of Daytona and their sponsor was Daytona Mitsubishi. Craig Conway, Eric Van Cleef and Todd Flis were the drivers.|$|E

5000|$|World’s Biggest Pac-Man {{offers the}} option to create your maze and this feature is what defines this game and makes it {{different}} from the original one. User has {{to be connected to}} Facebook {{in order to create a}} maze, otherwise the levels are only playable for fun and no mazes can be created. Adding a maze to a certain location has been made easy, just hover a pointer to the plus sign which can be found adjacent to other mazes and press create. Instructions are given to the user on how to use the creation tool, where there is a pencil to use for creating walls, dots and power pellets, and a rubber which can be used to remove any mistakes or changes. The creating tool also has a time limit of 60 minutes which is plenty of time for most users to create a maze, but if it is not enough, more than one maze can be created. The user has {{the option to}} reset the maze but the time limit does not reset when doing this. Once the maze is finished and the user is happy with the results, they have the option to preview their work or simply just submit it, and it will be added to the vast and growing world of all the other mazes other users have created on World’s Biggest Pac-Man. At the moment the game has a grid of over 4,000 x 4,000, which supports over 16 million mazes. Dan Kitzler, of West Covina , California USA, was the first to reach the edge of the [...] "supposed" [...] 4,000 X 4,000 grid on November 21, 2016. He went beyond that <b>grid</b> <b>number,</b> shattering the illusion that the grid only contains 16 million mazes. Dan contacted Ashley Ringrose (website creator), and even Mr. Ringrose does not know the actual size of the maze grid. The maze grid is made up of 25 X 25 (625 maze) quandrants.|$|E

30|$|Meanwhile, {{three kinds}} of <b>grid</b> <b>number</b> in {{shell-side}} were established to conduct the grid independence test, 316723, 323123 and 329523. It is derived that the relative error of convective heat transfer coefficient between 316723 and 323123 is 0.23 % and the relative error of convective heat transfer coefficient between 323123 and 329523 is 0.16 %. Almost equal vibration frequency of planar elastic tube bundle occurs for these {{three kinds of}} <b>grid</b> <b>number.</b> Therefore, the shell-side was discretized to 323123 grids to solve the flow-induced vibration calculation in view of saving computer resource and keeping a balance between computational economics and accuracy.|$|E
40|$|The void {{fraction}} of computational cells in numerical simulations of particulate flows using computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method (CFD-DEM) is often directly (or crudely) calculated {{assuming that the}} entire body of a particle lies in the cell at which the particle centroid resides. This direct method is most inexpensive but inaccurate and may lead to simulation instabilities. In this study, {{a modified version of}} the direct method has been proposed. In this method, referred to as the particle meshing method (PMM), the particle is meshed and the solid volume in a fluid cell is calculated by adding up the particle mesh volume with the basic working principle being the same as that of the direct method. As a result, the PMM inherits the simplicity and hence the computational advantage from the direct method, whilst allowing for duplicating the particle shape and accurate accounting of particle volume in each fluid cell. The numerical simulation characteristics of PMM including numerical stability, minimum particle <b>grid</b> <b>number,</b> prediction accuracy, and computational efficiency have been examined. The results showed that for a specific cell-to-particle size ratio, there was a minimum particle <b>grid</b> <b>number</b> required to reach the stable simulation. A formula of estimating the minimum particle <b>grid</b> <b>number</b> was derived and discussed. Typically, a particle <b>grid</b> <b>number</b> of about 5 times the minimum number was suggested to achieve the best computational efficiency, which was comparable or even higher than that of simulations using the analytical approach. PMM also exhibited the potential to be applied for complex computational domain geometries and irregular shaped particles...|$|E
