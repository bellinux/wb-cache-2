25|$|A second {{consideration}} {{related to}} the feedstock is moisture content. Drier, stackable substrates, such as food and yard waste, are suitable for digestion in tunnel-like chambers. Tunnel-style systems typically have near-zero wastewater discharge, as well, so this style of system has advantages where the discharge of digester liquids are a liability. The wetter the material, the more suitable {{it will be to}} handling with standard pumps instead of energy-intensive concrete pumps and physical means of movement. Also, the wetter the material, the more volume and area it takes up relative to the levels of gas produced. The moisture content of the target feedstock will also affect what type of system is applied to its treatment. To use a high-solids anaerobic digester for dilute feedstocks, bulking agents, such as compost, should be applied to increase the solids content of the <b>input</b> <b>material.</b> Another key consideration is the carbon:nitrogen ratio of the <b>input</b> <b>material.</b> This ratio is the balance of food a microbe requires to grow; the optimal C:N ratio is 20–30:1. Excess N can lead to ammonia inhibition of digestion.|$|E
25|$|Digestate is {{the solid}} {{remnants}} of the original <b>input</b> <b>material</b> to the digesters that the microbes cannot use. It also consists of the mineralised remains of the dead bacteria from within the digesters. Digestate can come in three forms: fibrous, liquor, or a sludge-based {{combination of the two}} fractions. In two-stage systems, different forms of digestate come from different digestion tanks. In single-stage digestion systems, the two fractions will be combined and, if desired, separated by further processing.|$|E
25|$|In general, one can {{say that}} the {{processes}} to make PET bottle flakes from collected bottles are as versatile as the different waste streams are different in their composition and quality. In view of technology there isn't just one way to do it. Meanwhile, there are many engineering companies that are offering flake production plants and components, {{and it is difficult to}} decide for one or other plant design. Nevertheless, there are processes that are sharing most of these principles.

40|$|Abstract: Iron ore {{and coal}} {{together}} {{account for about}} 72 % of cost of <b>input</b> <b>materials</b> in Indian steel plants. Moreover, sourcing iron ore and coal for steel plants is posing multitude of challenges including availability, quality and logistics. At present {{it is found that}} high quality <b>input</b> <b>materials</b> are hard to reach and easy to reach ones are of lower quality. Hence efficient utilisation of lower quality <b>input</b> <b>materials</b> has assumed greater significance for the sustainability of the steel plants. Accordingly the focus should be on beneficiation and agglomeration of lower quality <b>input</b> <b>materials</b> and development & application of new technologies for efficient use of the same in the steel plants. It also requires a paradigm shift from adopting technology dependent primarily on high quality <b>input</b> <b>materials</b> to introducing and absorbing alternate and mixed routes of production, which can efficiently utilise lower quality <b>input</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this research, a {{mathematical}} form of production function is investigated, {{which is a}} concept of microeconomics theory, with the actual data from the factory in Dnepropetrovsk Region of Ukraine, which produces the alloys from several <b>input</b> <b>materials.</b> A linear form of the production function {{was selected as the}} model, which consists of the variables that represent <b>input</b> <b>materials</b> together with their weighting factors, then the Lagrangean multiplier technique was used to transform this model in order to find the conditions for maximizing the output of the production, under a given cost constraint. The obtained conditions present the mathematical relations between the prices and the quantities of the <b>input</b> <b>materials,</b> which include unknown weighting factors. In order to get the values of the weighting factors, statistical analysis is made with the actual data. The result shows statistical significance of the model, therefore it is concluded that the selected linear function can be the production function. ???????????????? ?????????????? ????? ???????????????? ???????, ??????? ???????? ?????????? ?????????????????? ??????, ? ?????????????? ??????????? ?????? ?? ??????????? ? ???????????????? ??????? ???????, ??????? ?????????? ?????? ?? ?????????? ???????? ??????????. ???????? ????? ???????????????? ??????? ???? ??????? ? ???????? ??????, ????????? ?? ??????????, ?????????????? ???????? ????????? ?????? ?? ?????? ???????? ??????????????. ??? ??????? ??????????????? ?????? ????? ??? ???????? ????? ?????????? ???????? ??? ????????????? ???? ?????? ? ????? ??????????? ??????? ??? ???????????? ?????? ???????? ????????? ??? ???????????? ?? ???????. ?????????? ??????? ???????????? ?????????????? ??????????? ????? ????? ? ??????????? ???????? ??????????, ? ??? ????? ??????????? ??????? ????????. ??? ????, ????? ???????? ???????? ??????? ?????????????, ???????? ?????????????? ?????? ????????? ??????????? ??????. ?????????? ????????? ??????????????? ? ?????????????? ?????????? ??????, ??????? ????? ??????? ?????, ??? ????????? ???????? ??????? ????? ???? ???????????????? ????????...|$|R
25|$|Another process {{involves}} {{conversion of}} assorted polymers into petroleum by {{a much less}} precise thermal depolymerization process. Such a process {{would be able to}} accept almost any polymer or mix of polymers, including thermoset materials such as vulcanized rubber tires and the biopolymers in feathers and other agricultural waste. Like natural petroleum, the chemicals produced can be used as fuels or as feedstock. A RESEM Technology plant of this type in Carthage, Missouri, USA, uses turkey waste as <b>input</b> <b>material.</b> Gasification is a similar process but is not technically recycling since polymers are not likely to become the result.|$|E
25|$|Gaseous oxygen is {{excluded}} from the reactions by physical containment. Anaerobes utilize electron acceptors from sources other than oxygen gas. These acceptors can be the organic material itself or may be supplied by inorganic oxides from within the <b>input</b> <b>material.</b> When the oxygen source in an anaerobic system {{is derived from the}} organic material itself, the 'intermediate' end products are primarily alcohols, aldehydes, and organic acids, plus carbon dioxide. In the presence of specialised methanogens, the intermediates are converted to the 'final' end products of methane, carbon dioxide, and trace levels of hydrogen sulfide. In an anaerobic system, the majority of the chemical energy contained within the starting material is released by methanogenic bacteria as methane.|$|E
25|$|In principle, {{gasification}} {{can proceed}} from {{just about any}} organic material, including biomass and plastic waste. The resulting syngas can be combusted. Alternatively, if the syngas is clean enough, it {{may be used for}} power production in gas engines, gas turbines or even fuel cells, or converted efficiently to dimethyl ether (DME) by methanol dehydration, methane via the Sabatier reaction, or diesel-like synthetic fuel via the Fischer–Tropsch process. In many gasification processes most of the inorganic components of the <b>input</b> <b>material,</b> such as metals and minerals, are retained in the ash. In some gasification processes (slagging gasification) this ash has the form of a glassy solid with low leaching properties, but the net power production in slagging gasification is low (sometimes negative) and costs are higher.|$|E

40|$|In {{practice}} it often happens that a newly built road soon, after the asphalt mixture is added, starts showing first cracks and damages, {{which are not}} necessarily always a fault of the contractor, who built in the asphalt mixture, but can derive from the production of asphalt mixture. Such mistakes {{in the production of}} the asphalt mixture are hard to prove, since all the contractors usually put the blame on the automatic mixing production in the asphalt plant. During the production of the asphalt mixture, samples of <b>input</b> <b>materials</b> are taken, while the produced asphalt mixture is also sampled {{at the end of the}} production process. An inadequate asphalt mixture can be produced within the asphalt plant due to the damages in its machinery, inadequate <b>input</b> <b>materials</b> or the human factor plays a role in it, since we must not forget that all the machinery within the asphalt plant and computer programmes are supervised by man. Human factor also plays a role in the correct storing of <b>input</b> <b>materials.</b> It is the authority of the head of the asphalt plant to decide to ship the mixture to the contractor or not. The Master's thesis researches the reasons for errors in the production which is completely automated since it is based on a computer programme. The current Slovene legislation on the production of asphalt mixtures and technical specification for roadways was analysed. The legislation defines in detail the <b>input</b> <b>materials,</b> parts of the asphalt plant, the production procedure and the enforcement of the control, and includes the contents of the procedural book of quality control in the asphalt plant. All the most common damages to asphalt roadways, which may be a result of errors in the asphalt mixture production and may derive from material deterioration, are given at the end of the Master's thesis. Material deterioration can be a result of inadequate storing of <b>input</b> <b>materials,</b> errors in measuring dosages, temperatures that are too low during the mixing process, the time of mixing and of numerous other reasons. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper builds and {{estimates}} {{a new model}} of firm behavior that includes decisions to order, use, and stock <b>input</b> <b>materials</b> in a stage-of-fabrication environment with either gross production or value added technology. The model extends the traditional linear-quadratic model of output (finished goods) inventories by incorporating delivery and usage of <b>input</b> <b>materials</b> plus <b>input</b> inventory investment - features which largely have been ignored in the literature. Stylized facts indicate that input inventories are empirically more important than output inventories, especially in business cycle fluctuations. Firms simultaneously choose input and output inventories; thus, the model exhibits feedback between stocks induced by dynamic stage-of-fabrication linkages. Estimation of inventory decision rules shows the model is reasonably consistent with data in nondurable and durable goods industries. The results reveal inventory stock interaction, convex costs, and viability of gross production and value added specifications, industrial differences, and input inventory-saving technology.
