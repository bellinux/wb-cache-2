40|$|Objectives To {{ascertain}} if <b>fetal</b> head <b>position</b> on transabdominal ultrasound {{is associated}} with delivery by Cesarean section in nulliparous women with a prolonged first stage of labor. Methods This was a prospective observational study performed at Stavanger University Hospital, Norway, and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK, between January 2012 and April 2013. Nulliparous pregnant women with a singleton cephalic presentation at term and prolonged labor had <b>fetal</b> head <b>position</b> assessed by ultrasound. The main outcome was Cesarean section vs vaginal delivery, and secondary outcomes were association of <b>fetal</b> head <b>position</b> with operative vaginal delivery and duration of remaining time in labor. Results <b>Fetal</b> head <b>position</b> was assessed successfully by ultrasound examination in 142 / 150 (95 %) women. In total, 19 / 50 (38 %) women with a fetus in the occiput posterior (OP) position were delivered by Cesarean section compared with 16 / 92 (17 %) women with a fetus in a non-OP position (P= 0. 01). On multivariable logistic regression analysis, the OP position predicted delivery by Cesarean section with an odds ratio (OR) of 2. 9 (95 % CI, 1. 3 - 6. 7; P= 0. 01) and induction of labor with an OR of 2. 4 (95 % CI, 1. 0 - 5. 6; P= 0. 05). <b>Fetal</b> head <b>position</b> {{was not associated with}} operative vaginal delivery or with remaining time in labor. The agreement between a digital and an ultrasound assessment of OP position was poor (Cohen's kappa= 0. 19; P= 0. 18).

25|$|In 1978, the Munch scholar Robert Rosenblum {{suggested}} that the strange, sexless creature in the foreground of the painting {{was inspired by a}} Peruvian mummy, which Munch could have seen at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris. This mummy, which was buried in a <b>fetal</b> <b>position</b> with its hands alongside its face, also struck the imagination of Munch's friend Paul Gauguin: it stood as a model for figures in more than twenty of Gauguin's paintings, among those the central figure in his painting, Human misery (Grape harvest at Arles) and for the old woman at the left in his painting, Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?. In 2004, an Italian anthropologist speculated that Munch might have seen a mummy in Florence's Museum of Natural History, which bears an even more striking resemblance to the painting. Nonetheless, later studies have confirmed Rosenblum's suggestion, disproving the Italian theory, for Munch had not been to Florence until after painting The Scream.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Instrumental {{deliveries}} {{are commonly}} {{performed in the}} United Kingdom and Ireland, with rates of 12 – 17 % in most centres. Knowing the exact <b>position</b> of the <b>fetal</b> head is a pre-requisite for safe instrumental delivery. Traditionally, diagnosis of the <b>fetal</b> head <b>position</b> is made on transvaginal digital examination by delineating the suture lines of the fetal skull and the fontanelles. However, the accuracy of transvaginal digital examination can be unreliable and varies between 20 % and 75 %. Failure to identify the correct <b>fetal</b> head <b>position</b> {{increases the likelihood of}} failed instrumental delivery with the additional morbidity of sequential use of instruments or second stage caesarean section. The use of ultrasound in determining the <b>position</b> of the <b>fetal</b> head has been explored but is not part of routine clinical practice. Methods/Design A multi-centre randomised controlled trial is proposed. The study will take place in two large maternity units in Ireland with a combined annual birth rate of 13, 500 deliveries. It will involve 450 nulliparous women undergoing instrumental delivery after 37 [*]weeks gestation. The main outcome measure will be incorrect diagnosis of the <b>fetal</b> head <b>position.</b> A study involving 450 women will have 80 % power to detect a 10 % difference in the incidence of inaccurate diagnosis of the <b>fetal</b> head <b>position</b> with two-sided 5 % alpha. Discussion It is both important and timely to evaluate the use of ultrasound to diagnose the <b>fetal</b> head <b>position</b> prior to instrumental delivery before routine use can be advocated. The overall aim is to reduce the incidence of incorrect diagnosis of the <b>fetal</b> head <b>position</b> prior to instrumental delivery and improve the safety of instrumental deliveries.

25|$|The {{volume of}} SDN in medial preoptic area is {{modified}} by hormones, among which testosterone is {{proved to be}} of much importance. The larger volume of male SDN is correlated to the higher concentration of fetal testosterone level in males than in females. Also, {{there is evidence that}} testosterone acts during specific prenatal period to organize the development of aromatase-expressing neurons into the male-typical SDN (testosterone is transformed to estrogen by aromatase). The effect of testosterone is also reflected by the influence of fetal intrauterine position on the morphology of SDN-POA. Studies demonstrated that male rats which were gestated between two male fetuses (2M) have 2-fold larger SDN-POA volumes than those gestated between two female fetuses (2F). At the same time, the testosterone levels, as well as the 17β-estradiol (product of testosterone) levels, were found to be significantly larger in 2M males than in 2F males on gestation day 21 (testosterone can be transferred from adjacent male fetuses to the target rats). However, evidence fails to show any relationship between SDN volume and female <b>fetal</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
25|$|Prayer {{appears to}} have health implications. Empirical studies suggest that mindfully reading and reciting the Psalms (from scripture) can help a person calm down and focus. Prayer is also {{positively}} correlated with happiness and religious satisfaction (Poloma & Pendleton, 1989, 1991). A study conducted by Franceis, Robbins, Lewis, and Barnes (2008) investigated the relationship between self-reported prayer frequency and measures of psychoticism and neuroticism according to the abbreviated form of the Revised Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQR-A). The study included a sample size of 2306 students attending Protestant and Catholic schools in the highly religious culture of Northern Ireland. The data shows a negative correlation between prayer frequency and psychoticism. The data also shows that, in Catholic students, frequent prayer has a positive correlation to neuroticism scores. Ladd and McIntosh (2008) suggest that prayer-related behaviors, such as bowing the head and clasping the hands together in an almost <b>fetal</b> <b>position,</b> are suggestive of “social touch” actions. Prayer in this manner may prepare an individual to carry out positive pro-social behavior after praying, due to factors such as increased {{blood flow to the}} head and nasal breathing. Overall, slight health benefits have been found fairly consistently across studies.|$|E

METHODS: If instrumental delivery was required, women who had provided written consent were randomised to receive clinical assessment (standard care) or ultrasound scan and clinical assessment (ultrasound). [Correction added on 17 April 2014, after first online publication: Sentence was amended. ] MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incorrect diagnosis of the <b>fetal</b> head <b>position.</b> RESULTS: The incidence of incorrect diagnosis was significantly lower in the ultrasound group than the standard care group (4 / 257, 1. 6 %, versus 52 / 257, 20. 2 %; odds ratio 0. 06; 95 % confidence interval 0. 02 - 0. 19; P < 0. 001).

40|$|Background—Preventing the {{progression}} of fetal aortic stenosis (AS) to hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) requires identification of fetuses with salvageable left hearts who would progress to HLHS if left untreated, a successful in utero valvotomy, and demonstration that a successful valvotomy promotes left heart growth in utero. Fetuses meeting the first criterion are undefined, and previous reports of fetal AS dilation have not evaluated the impact of intervention on in utero growth of left heart structures. Methods and Results—We offered fetal AS dilation to 24 mothers whose fetuses had AS. At least 3 echocardiographers assigned a high probability that all 24 fetuses would progress to HLHS if left untreated. Twenty (21 to 29 weeks’ gestation) underwent attempted AS dilation, with technical success in 14. Ideal <b>fetal</b> <b>positioning</b> for cannula puncture site and course of the needle (with or without laparotomy) proved to be necessary for procedural success. Serial fetal echocardiograms after intervention demonstrated growth arrest of the left heart structures in unsuccessful cases and in those who declined the procedure, while ongoing left heart growth was seen in successful cases. Resumed left heart growth led to a 2 -ventricle circulation at birth in 3 babies. Conclusions—Fetal echocardiography can identify midgestation fetuses with AS who {{are at high risk}} for developing HLHS. Timely and successful aortic valve dilation requires ideal <b>fetal</b> and cannula <b>positioning,</b> prevents left heart growth arrest, and may result in normal ventricular anatomy and function at birth.
