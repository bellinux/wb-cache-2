40|$|AbstractSeveral {{advantages}} can {{be obtained}} by setting fin walls in the basement of super tall buildings. On one hand, the overall stiffness of foundation could be improved and then differential foundation settlement could be reduced. On the other hand, basement shear stiffness could be effectively increased and the ground floor could be set as the lateral support with appropriate percentage of basement fin walls. Besides, the fin walls can also increase punching resistance capacity for pile-raft foundation and can thus reduce the raft mat thickness. In order to assess the performance of <b>fin</b> <b>wall</b> of the Shanghai tower project, a three dimensional finite element model including piles, raft mat and the superstructure was firstly established. Two cases, including model with <b>fin</b> <b>wall</b> and model without <b>fin</b> <b>wall,</b> were considered, and the structural periods, story drift, internal forces of key members and differential deformation were obtained respectively. By considering the effect of concrete cracking and shrinkage, the performance of model with and without <b>fin</b> <b>wall</b> stiffness reduction was compared. Based on the above mentioned analysis, the mat support condition and construction process were considered for further analysis to evaluate the performance of <b>fin</b> <b>wall.</b> The key factors with the <b>fin</b> <b>wall</b> performance were thoroughly discussed in this study, and the analysis conclusions could be used as reference for the structural design of <b>fin</b> <b>wall</b> in super tall buildings...|$|E

The numerical simulations were conducted using the finite element code of LS-DYNA. The effect of <b>fin</b> <b>wall</b> imperfection was assessed through the <b>fin</b> <b>wall</b> bending and bulging. The numerical homogenization of the single layer corrugated structure was performed using MAT 26 honeycomb material model. The buckling stress of single- and double-layer corrugated sandwich structures increased when the strain rate increased. The increased buckling stresses were ascribed to the micro inertial effects. The initial buckling stress at quasi-static and high strain rate was numerically shown to be imperfection sensitive. Increasing the number of core layers decreased the buckling stress and increased the densification strain. The panels tested with spherical and flat striker tips were not penetrated and experienced slightly higher deformation forces and energy absorptions in 0 °/ 90 ° corrugated layer orientation than in 0 °/ 0 ° orientation. However, the panels tested using a conical striker tip were penetrated/perforated and showed comparably smaller deformation forces and energy absorptions, especially in 0 °/ 90 ° layer orientation. The homogenized models predicted the low velocity compression /indentation and projectile impact tests of the multi-layer corrugated sandwich with an acceptable accuracy with reduced computational time...|$|E

40|$|This thesis reports an {{investigation}} on time-dependent loss of post-tensioned masonry box and tee sections representing diaphragm and <b>fin</b> <b>walls,</b> respectively. The prestress loss due to creep and shrinkage of masonry, and relaxation of steel bars were quantified separately {{and the main}} influencing factors considered were geometry and masonry type. For each type of masonry three diaphragm and three <b>fin</b> <b>walls</b> were built to determine prestress loss (decreasing load), creep (constant load) and shrinkage (zero load). The walls were constructed from undocked clay, calcium silicate and concrete block units with grade (ii) mortar with cementlime:sand in the proportions of 1 :½: 4 ½ and water/cement ratio of 1. 27. Creep and shrinkage were also measured on unbonded masonry units and mortar prisms for predicting the deformations in the masonry walls by using a previously developed composite model. The mal;onry units and mortar prisms were partly sealed to simulate the corresponding volume/surface ratio of the bonded masonry units and mortar joints in the masonry walls. The calcium silicate walls exhibited the highest prestress loss, creep and shrinkage compared with the clay and concrete block diaphragm and <b>fin</b> <b>walls.</b> The current methods of prediction of prestress loss for masonry are only suitable for specific types of masonry {{for which they were}} developed. On the other hand, the methods developed for prestressed concrete gave reasonable predictions for all the masonry types investigated, with one particular method being very accurate. For all test results it was confirmed that long-term deformations were influenced by geometry, <b>fin</b> <b>walls</b> exhibiting greater deformations than diaphragm walls. The composite model did not predict shrinkage very well in calcium silicate and concretc block walls because some moisture in the mortar was absorbed by the masonry units. As a result the partly sealed unbonded mortar prisms had higher water content than the mortar bed joint in the walls, and thus a higher shrinkage in the partly sealed mortar prisms occured. Consequently, when the creep and shrinkage of the partly sealed mortar prisms was applied to the model, the masonry deformation was overestimated. A modified water absorption test was carried out which confirmed that for units laid dry the mortar bed joint had a reduced shrinkage compared to the unbonded mortar prisms. From the results, creep and shrinkage adjustment factors were correlated with unit water absorption, and when adjusted creep and shrinkage were incorporated with the composite model, satisfactory predictions of masonry deformations were achieved. ...|$|R

The flows are solved with an efficient implicit upwind flux-difference split Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes code. Numerical results are compared with experimental data for a flow at Mach 8. 28 and Reynolds number 5. 3 x 10 (exp 6) with crossing shock-waves and expansion fans generated by two lateral 15 fins located {{on top of a}} cold-wall plate.

Simulations show the development of two primary counter-rotating cross-flow vortices and secondary turbulent structures under the main vortices and in each corner singularity inside the turbulent boundary layer. A significant loss of total pressure is produced by the complex interaction between the main vortices and the uplifted jet stream of the boundary layer. The overall agreement between computational and experimental data is generally good.

The objectives are to examine the variations in both the mean and local (axial and circumferential) heat transfer coefficients for circular coolant channels with spiral <b>finned</b> <b>walls</b> and/or spiral <b>fins</b> with a twisted tape, and improve the data reduction technique of a previous investigator. The working fluid is freon- 11 with an inlet temperature of 22. 2 C (approximately 21 C subcooling). The coolant channel's exit pressure and mass velocity are 0. 19 M Pa (absolute) and 0. 21 Mg/sq. ms, respectively. Two tube configurations were examined; i. e., tubes had either 6. 52 (small pitch) or 4. 0 (large pitch) fins/cm of the circumferential length (26 and 16 fins, respectively). The large pitch fins were also examined with a twisted tape insert. The inside nominal diameter of the copper channels {{at the root of the}} fins was 1. 0 cm. The results show that by adding enhancement devices, boiling occurs almost simultaneously at all axial locations. The case of spiral fins with large pitch resulted in larger mean (circumferentially averaged) heat transfer coefficients, h sub m, at all axial locations.

40|$|A {{prototype}} tool {{to assist}} architects {{during the early}} design stage of floor plans has been developed, consisting of an Evolutionary Program for the Space Allocation Problem (EPSAP), which generates sets of floor plan alternatives according to the architect's preferences; and a Floor Plan Performance Optimization Program (FPOP), which optimizes the selected solutions according to thermal performance criteria. The design variables subject to optimization are window position and size, overhangs, <b>fins,</b> <b>wall</b> positioning, and building orientation. A procedure using a transformation operator with gradient descent, such as behavior, coupled with a dynamic simulation engine was developed for the thermal evaluation and optimization process. However, the need to evaluate all possible alternatives regarding designing variables being used during the optimization process leads to an intensive use of thermal simulation, which dramatically increases the simulation time, rendering it unpractical. An alternative approach is a smart optimization approach, which utilizes an oriented and adaptive search technique to efficiently find the near optimum solution. This paper presents the search methodology for the building orientation of floor plan designs, and the corresponding efficiency and effectiveness indicators. The calculations are based on 100 floor plan designs generated by EPSAP. All floor plans have the same design program, location, and weather data, changing only their geometry.

40|$|Historical {{numerical}} {{methods for}} solving stiff ordinary differential equations are investigated {{and a new}} numerical framework developed and applied {{to a variety of}} hydrodynamic stability problems where the effects of passive wall compliance are investigated. The compound matrix method is set in a general coordinate free framework using exterior algebra, and is considered to be the most accurate and easy to implement method for complex systems. The effect of passive wall compliance on the Blasius boundary layer flow is studied. The linear stability of the mean flow state is considered using the new numerical framework and shooting technique. A Newton algorithm is implemented to converge the eigenvalue such that the boundary condition at the surface is satisfied. Curves of neutral stability are produced in the Re-alpha plane for various degrees of compliance, damping and tension parameters. Three dimensionality is incorporated first by a simple introduction of rotation in the flow leading to the investigation of the Ekman boundary layer problem where a Coriolis force instability mechanism (type- 2) produces streamwise rolls at modest Reynolds numbers. The linear stability of the Ekman mean flow state is considered using an extension of the new numerical framework for use on the vector space Lambda(3) (C 6). Curves of neutral stability are produced in the E-gamma plane for constant values of the Reynolds number and in the Re-gamma plane for a selection of constant angle of orientation, E. This work is extended to consider the effects of wall compliance on the type- 2 viscous instability mechanism, with the type- 1 mode of instability briefly discussed.

The maximum overall footprint area of the cooling solution is 534 mm 2 with a profile height of 5 mm. Previous analysis has shown that due to fan exit angle, flow does not enter the heat sinks parallel to the <b>fins</b> or bounding <b>walls.</b> This results in a nonuniform flow rate within the channels of the finned and finless heat sinks along with impingement of the flow at the entrance giving rise to large entrance pressure losses. In this paper straightening diffusers were attached at the exit of the fan, which resulted in aligning the flow entering the heat sinks with the <b>fins</b> and channel <b>walls.</b> Detailed velocity measurements were obtained using particle image velocimetry, which provided a further insight into the physics of the flow in such miniature geometries and in designing the straightening diffusers.

A single sided flow exit was used in a geometry that was applicable to reverse flow cooling of low NOx combustors, but was also relevant to turbine blade and nozzle cooling. A 10 × 10 row of impingement jet holes (hole density n of 4306 m- 2) was used, which had ten rows of holes in the cross-flow direction. One heat transfer enhancement obstacle per impingement jet was investigated and compared with previously published experimental results, for Nimonic 75 metal walls, for flow pressure loss and surface averaged heat transfer coefficients. Two different shaped obstacles were investigated with an impingement gap, Z, of 10 mm: A continuous rectangular rib 4. 5 mm high (H) and 3. 0 mm thick and a rectangular pin-fin rib with ten 8 mm high (H) pins that were 8. 6 mm wide and 3. 0 mm thick. The obstacles were equally spaced on the centreline between each row of impingement jets aligned with the crossflow. The impingement jet pitch to diameter X/D and gap to diameter Z/D ratios were kept constant at 4. 66 and 3. 06 for X, Z and D of 15. 24, 10. 00 and 3. 27 mm, respectively. The two obstacles investigated had obstacle height to diameter ratio H/D of 1. 38 and 2. 45. The computations were carried out for three different air coolant mass fluxes G of 1. 08, 1. 48 and 1. 94 kg/sm 2 bar. The pressure loss δP/P and surface average heat transfer coefficient (HTC) h predictions for all three G showed good agreement with the experimental results. The predicted results were also compared with the impingement jet single exit flow, for a smooth target wall of the same impingement hole configuration. A significant increase in the overall surface averaged heat transfer was predicted and measured for the co-flow configuration with rectangular pinfins.

40|$|Studies on thermal {{enhancement}} {{for electronic}} chips {{has been gaining}} prominence as increased transistor density in the chips calls for larger heat dissipation. Various enhancement techniques have been proposed ever since 1981, to enhance the heat dissipation from the chip surface. Micro pin fins have been gaining recognition as a highly favorable surface enhancement due to the design versatility it provides {{in the form of}} myriad geometric shapes and fin arrangements as opposed to convention microchannels. The micro pin fins however, present a larger pressure drop over the surface as compared to other conventional methods which reduces the thermal efficiency of the chip surface. To reduce the pressure drop associated with micro pin fins, short micro pin fins were proposed. A short micro pin fin arrangement is similar to micro pin fin arrays, with one change, in that short micro pin fins have a clearance between the fins and the top of the channel. The current study focusses on heat transfer and pressure drop over short micro pin fin arrays. Experimental studies were conducted over 10 mm × 10 mm with fin heights varying from 200 to 500 µm and clearance over the fins varying from 265 to 900 µm. Distilled water was used as the cooling medium. The heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop characteristics were evaluated at varying fin heights and varying clearance of the surfaces with an aim to identify optimum fin height and clearance parameters. The heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop data obtained from experiments were also evaluated with the correlation proposed by Tullius et al. [17]. Data showed that the highest heat transfer coefficient was observed for fins with the largest fin height. When fin clearance was evaluated for its effect on heat transfer coefficient, a hint of mixing phenomenon leading to enhancement in heat transfer coefficient was observed at higher clearance values. A higher pressure drop was observed at longer fins owing to the increased friction factor at the <b>fin</b> <b>walls.</b> The highest pressure drop of over 100 kPa was observed for a chip gasket combination which consisted of the longest fins with the least amount of clearance. It was also observed that the Nusselt number and Pressure drop correlations proposed by Tullius et al was not able to accurately predict the experimental data. However, the correlation did show the same trend as the experimental data, hence, the present correlation could be modified or used as a basis for new correlations of Nusselt number and friction factor...|$|R

The assumptions during the analysis have been taken considering the manufacturing and practical applications and working conditions. Hence the results obtained {{can be referred to}} while solving any such kind of problems in the practical field where only natural convection is under consideration. After comparing it is shown that we can find that the best configuration for this type of convective heat transfer of a heated pipe is a TRAPEZOIDAL fin as they have the highest total heat transfer rate...|$|R
40|$|In this study, several {{turbulence}} {{models are}} analyzed in a 3 -D {{finite element model}} of a micro-heat exchanger. The micro-heat exchanger consists of a narrow planar flow passage between parallel walls with small cylindrical pin <b>fins</b> spanning these <b>walls</b> with axes perpendicular to the direction of flow. Turbulence model performance is compared with baseline experimental data available in the literature that cover a range of low turbulent Reynolds numbers and spacing configurations. The metric for these comparisons is an array averaged Nusselt Number. Adjustments made to the coefficients in the turbulence models are {{explained in terms of}} their physical significance to the complex flow environment of a pin fin, cross flow, micro-heat exchanger. Applications of this research include cooling of turbine blades and of closely spaced electronics. US Navy (USN) author...|$|R
40|$|The {{transient}} response {{of a single}} cell of a typical phase change material type thermal capacitor has been modeled using numerical conductive heat transfer techniques. The cell consists of a base plate, an insulated top, and two vertical <b>walls</b> (<b>fins)</b> forming a two-dimensional cavity filled with a phase change material. Both explicit and implicit numerical formulations are outlined. A mixed explicit-implicit scheme which treats the fin implicity while treating the phase change material explicitly is discussed. A band algorithmic scheme is used to reduce computer storage requirements for the implicit approach while retaining a relatively fine grid. All formulations are presented in dimensionless form thereby enabling application to geometrically similar problems. Typical parametric results are graphically presented for the case of melting with constant heat input {{to the base of}} the cell...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the design of {{portable}} electronic devices must incorporate thermal analyses to ensure the device can be adequately cooled to acceptable temperatures. Consumer demand for smaller, more powerful devices has {{lead to an increase}} in the heat required to be dissipated and a reduction in the surface area both of which result in an increased heat flux. In this paper, an experimental study is performed on one of the smallest commercially available miniature fans, suitable for cooling portable electronic devices, used in conjunction with both finned and finless heat sinks. Previous analysis has shown that due to fan exit angle, flow does not enter the heat sinks parallel to the <b>fins</b> or bounding <b>walls.</b> This results in a non uniform flow rate within the channels of the finned and finless heat sink along with impingement of the flow at the entrance giving rise to large entrance pressure losses. In this paper straightening diffusers were attached at the exit of the fan which resulted in aligning the flow entering the heat sinks with the <b>fins</b> and channel <b>walls.</b> In designing the finned heat sink current optimization criterion for finned heat exchangers has been applied to ensure maximum heat transfer rates; the finless heat sink was designed to the same specifications. The maximum overall footprint area of the cooling solution is 534 mm 2 with a profile height of 5 mm. The thermal performance of each cooling solution was investigated by quantifying its thermal resistance over a range of fan speeds and comparing the results to cases without diffusers. In order to investigate the flow field, detailed velocity measurements were obtained using Particle Image Velocimetry, which provided a further insight into the physics of the flow in such miniature geometries and in designing the straightening diffusers. The thermal analysis results indicate that the cooling power of the solution is increased by up to 20 % through the introduction of a diffuser. Hence, demonstrating the need for integrated fan and heat sink design of low profile applications. © 2008 IEEE...|$|R
30|$|LBM {{was applied}} to {{simulate}} forced convection heat transfer in two-dimensional channel including extended surfaces to investigate the effect of changing different parameters such as Reynolds number (10, 50, and 100) and nanofluid (Al 2 O 3) volume fractions (0.0, 0.03, and 0.05). The results showed that as the Reynolds number increases, {{the rate of heat}} transfer also increases. The formation of vortices both in front and behind the objects enhances the heat transfer process. As the solid volume fraction increases, the heat transfer is enhanced for all values of the Reynolds numbers. This enhancement is more significant at high Reynolds numbers. The heat transfer rate of the fins increases with the thermal conductivity ratio of the fin to pure water. This enhancement has a finite limit. At this limit, the temperature at all surfaces of the <b>fins</b> approach the <b>wall</b> temperature. In this condition, the fins behave like constant temperature of heat sources.|$|R
