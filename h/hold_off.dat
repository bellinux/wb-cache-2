5|$|Although the {{engagement}} {{did not end}} the First Bulgarian Empire, the Battle of Kleidion reduced its ability to resist Byzantine advances and can be considered the pivotal encounter of the war with Byzantium. The heirs of Samuel could not subsequently <b>hold</b> <b>off</b> the Byzantine advance, and in 1018 the Bulgarian Empire was finally destroyed by Basil II.|$|E

He was {{deployed}} to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and in August 1942, he took part in the invasion of Guadalcanal. In October, he and two other Marines used machine guns to <b>hold</b> <b>off</b> an attack by a far numerically superior Japanese force. In February 1945, he was killed in action {{on the first day of}} the invasion of Iwo Jima, after he single-handedly destroyed an enemy blockhouse and led a Marine tank under fire safely through a minefield.|$|E

5|$|Schleswig-Holstein {{was joined}} on 4 September by the torpedo boats T196 and Von der Gröben. A force of German {{infantry}} and army engineers went ashore {{to take the}} fortress, with heavy fire support from Schleswig-Holstein. The Poles managed to <b>hold</b> <b>off</b> the Germans until {{they were forced to}} surrender on 7 September at 10:30. Following the Polish surrender, Schleswig-Holstein began shelling Polish positions at Hel and Redłowo; these operations lasted until 13 September. Between 25 and 27 September, the old battleship returned to Hel with her sister Schlesien; both vessels conducted further bombardments of Polish positions there.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the second}} phase of expansion, the runway would be {{lengthened}} to , allowing jet aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 to land at Mysore Airport. The runway cannot be extended to the west {{because of the presence of}} a railway line, while an extension to the east requires diverting National Highway 766. The State Government initially decided to <b>hold</b> <b>off</b> on this phase, preferring to wait until air traffic increased and the cost of diverting the runway was justified.|$|E
5|$|Although {{its total}} {{strength}} {{was estimated at}} 185,500 men in late May 1944, the 2nd Panzer Army {{was not able to}} rally more than 16,000 troops for Operation Rösselsprung due to ever-increasing Partisan activity throughout the country. The Germans had to rely on special forces and improved tactics. The Partisans defended the territory they controlled with significant demolition and mining of roads. Roadblocks were manned by patrols and smaller detachments, whose task was to <b>hold</b> <b>off</b> the enemy until reinforcements arrived. During Operation Rösselsprung, the Germans rendered these tactics ineffective by combining strong and fast motorised columns with adequate pioneer support. This combination was especially successful for the column led by the 92nd Motorised Regiment. The second German tactical innovation was the employment of five reconnaissance battalions for independent operations deep inside Partisan-controlled territory.|$|E
5|$|Although the Falaise Gap was {{narrowed to}} a {{distance}} of several hundred yards, attacks and counter-attacks by two battle groups of the 1st Polish Armoured Division and the II SS Panzer Corps on Hill 262 (Mont Ormel) prevented the quick closing of the gap and thousands of German troops escaped. During two days of nearly continuous fighting, Polish forces using artillery barrages and close-quarter fighting, managed to <b>hold</b> <b>off</b> counter-attacks by seven German divisions. On 21 August, elements of the First Canadian Army relieved the Polish survivors and sealed the Falaise Pocket by linking up with the Third US Army. This led to the surrender and capture of the remaining units of the German 7th Army in the pocket.|$|E

5|$|Howe {{fired his}} signal guns at 09:00 and the Hessians began to attack up Battle Pass, while the main army came at Sullivan from the rear. Sullivan left his advance guard to <b>hold</b> <b>off</b> the Hessians while {{he turned the}} rest of his force around to fight the British. Heavy {{casualties}} mounted between the Americans and the British, and men on both sides fled out of fear. Sullivan attempted to calm his men and tried to lead a retreat. By this point, the Hessians had overrun the advance guard on the heights and the American left had completely collapsed. Hand-to-hand fighting followed, with the Americans swinging their muskets and rifles like clubs to save their own lives. Many of the Americans who surrendered were bayoneted by the Hessians. Sullivan, despite the chaos, managed to evacuate most of his men to Brooklyn Heights though he himself was captured.|$|E
5|$|Ibrahim {{tried to}} enter Mani from the {{north-east}} near Almiro on June 21, 1826, {{but he was}} forced to stop at the fortifications at Vergas. His army of 7,000 men was held off by an army of 2,000 Maniots and 500 refugees from other parts of Greece. Despite Egyptian and Ottoman artillery, the outnumbered Maniots managed to <b>hold</b> <b>off</b> the Ottomans. Ibrahim sent 1,500 men to attempt a landing near Areopolis and go north to threaten the Maniot rear. This force was initially successful; however they were repelled with heavy losses. When the Egyptians at Vergas heard that Theodoros Kolokotronis was advancing on their rear they retreated.|$|E
5|$|In MarchNovember 1994, the ARBiH {{conducted}} {{a series of}} attacks with relatively limited objectives, attacking the VRS at the Vlašić Mountain, the Stolice Peak of the Majevica Mountain and Donji Vakuf, {{as well as in the}} area between Tešanj and Teslić, near Brčko, Kladanj, Sarajevo, on the Bjelašnica and the Treskavica Mountain, Gračanica, Vareš, Konjic and Doboj. Further efforts were made, together with the HVO, against the VRS near Nevesinje in SeptemberNovember, but most of the offensives made little or no gains. At the same time, VRS attacks north of Sarajevo were successfully repulsed. It was hoped by the ARBiH General Staff that the VRS could not muster sufficient reserves to <b>hold</b> <b>off</b> the simultaneous, relatively limited attacks. Little territory changed hands as a result of the ARBiH offensive by the end of October, but the VRS shortage of troops worsened.|$|E

By this time Hannibal's brother Hasdrubal Barca sought to cross the Alps into Italy and join his brother with a second army. Despite being defeated in Iberia in the Battle of Baecula, Hasdrubal managed to break through into Italy only to be defeated decisively by Gaius Claudius Nero and Marcus Livius Salinator on the Metaurus River.|$|E

Learning of this, the Elder (Philip Baker Hall)—a high-ranking Group official—demands an explanation; Watts divulges that the murdered {{man had been}} conspiring to pit conflicting faction within the Group against each other. Watts had found evidence {{in one of the}} photographs which may have influenced such a schism and wished to keep it hidden until its significance could be known. The Elder agrees, and similarly decides to <b>hold</b> <b>off</b> on testing which would reveal if an artefact in Johnston's possession was an authentic piece of the True Cross.|$|E

The embassy had just six Marine guards, whose job was limited to protecting the chancery. Ambassador Bishop made an urgent request to Washington for two platoons of soldiers to parachute into the embassy to defend it until the ships arrived. The request was denied, but the Ambassador was told that an advance element from the vessels would reach the embassy the following morning.|$|E
