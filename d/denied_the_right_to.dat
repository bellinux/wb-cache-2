5|$|In Canada, the Supreme Court held in Sauvé v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer) (2002), that a {{statutory}} provision prohibiting prisoners serving {{a sentence of}} two years or more from voting unjustifiably infringed the fundamental right to vote guaranteed by section 3 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Court noted that the Government could not demonstrate how denying prisoners the vote helped the stated aims of the relevant statute; a democracy built on inclusiveness, democracy and citizen participation cannot be party to a law that disenfranchises a considerable part of the population. There was also no credible theory why prisoners should be <b>denied</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> vote {{as a form of}} punishment, as it is arbitrary and not related to the offender's criminal act nor does it deter crime or rehabilitate criminals.|$|E
5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. One advertisement claimed, likely in error, that this film {{was based on the}} play The Man of the Hour. Written by George Broadhurst, the play focused on political corruption in the form of graft, but the play itself was apparently inspired by politicians of New York. The plot of the film includes a nod to the Women's suffrage movement, {{but it would be a}} decade before the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibited any United States citizen from being <b>denied</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> vote on the basis of sex. The character, Congressman Casey, would later be seen again in Orator, Knight and Cow Charmer. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. There are no known credits for the cast, but Anna Rosemond and Frank H. Crane are two possible actors that were prominent players in 1910. Credits may have included Anna Rosemond, one of two leading ladies of the Thanhouser company in this era. Frank H. Crane was a leading male actor of the company and also involved since the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company. Bowers states that most of the credits are fragmentary for 1910 Thanhouser productions. A surviving film still leaves open the possibility of identifying two characters.|$|E

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Reformation it was common in European countries for people of disfavored religious denominations to be denied civil and political rights, often including the right to vote, to stand for election or to sit in parliament.

A special conference of socialist women was convened in Berne, Switzerland in 1915, bringing together such key international socialist leaders as Alexandra Kollontai, Inessa Armand, and Clara Zetkin to share common experiences and set common agendas.|$|E

In April 2013, she reached a settlement with the Government that included financial compensation in addition to promised statutory changes. A leader of the Nationalist Party apologised for its part in contesting Cassar's right to marry.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to her gymnastics success, Čáslavská was known for her outspoken support of the Czechoslovak democratization movement and her opposition to the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia. At the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, she took this protest to the world stage by quietly looking down and away while the Soviet national anthem was played during the medal ceremonies for the balance beam and floor exercise event finals. While Čáslavská's actions were applauded by her compatriots, they resulted in her becoming a persona non grata in the new regime.
