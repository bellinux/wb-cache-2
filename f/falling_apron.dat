40|$|In a flume of BallastHam Dredging a <b>falling</b> <b>apron</b> {{model has}} been {{constructed}} and loaded by current. The tests have been done with different rock sizes, different layer thickness of the top storage of the apron and two different gradings. In summary {{it was found that}} for both the narrow graded rock layers as well as for wide graded riprap the final slope of the apron was always 1 : 2, while the riprap layer reached a thickness equal to dn 50. It was also clear from the tests that the slope did not stop the transport of sand on the slope, but retarded it considerably. The process of settlement of the riprap was that the stones did not roll over each other, but that the whole structure moved down, like on an escalator. For the protection of the abutments of the Januma Bridge in Bangladesh also a <b>falling</b> <b>apron</b> has been applied. This apron has been designed according the standard design rules, applying also a (relatively costly) wide grading of rock. In the framework of the maintenance of the structure, yearly surveys are made of the <b>falling</b> <b>apron.</b> These surveys show that also in prototype the slopes reached a steepness of approximately 1 : 2. A volumetric analysis indicated that also in reality the thickness of the <b>falling</b> <b>apron</b> was in the order of only one layer of stone...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{behaviour}} of a <b>falling</b> <b>apron</b> made from 'poorly sorted' material. It is a follow-up of a report, which was made by a Dutch student, Marc van der Hoeven, with the title: "The behaviour of a falling apron". In {{the end of the}} last century a complex river training work had to be done in con- nection with the construction of the Jamuna Bridge in Bangladesh crossing one of the largest rivers of the world. The Jamuna River has a strong changing character and the morphological behaviour is difficult to predict. By means of two banana-formed guide bunds the span of the bridge could be reduced from 15 km to 5 km. The constriction forced to an additional protection of the guide bunds. At the toe loose rock material was dumped, which 'fall' down' and covers the slope when erosion occurs. This is the reason why this kind of exibel protection is called 'falling apron'. In the previous study from Marc van der Hoeven only 'well sorted' material was used for the experiments, material with a narrow grading. In reality these falling aprons are made from material with a wide grading, called 'poorly sorted' material. For this reason a further study was demanded from the contractor Ballast-Ham-Dredging from the Netherlands. The experiments in a flume were mainly done with the aim to get information about the setting process of a <b>falling</b> <b>apron,</b> to determine the angle of the slope and the thickness of the protective layer after a ow attack. In two experiments it was found that the developing slope angle was approximately 1 : 2 and the setting process was evenly spread over the entire slope. A layer with an average thickness of the characteristic stone diameter of D 50 protected the emerging slope. This single layer does not stop the erosion, but it slows down the scour development and this even better in comparison to the 'well sorted' material. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{guidelines}} on rock protection at circular piers predominantly focus on preventing shear failure (by choosing a sufficiently large rock size), winnowing failure (by designing an appropriate filter) and edge failure (by selecting a sufficient extent). In particular areas (e. g. in an eroding river channel {{or in an}} area with large-scale bed forms), the rock protection may also face a degradation (lowering) of the bed. As a result, the edges will be undermined and stones will roll down and cover the newly developed slope (a <b>falling</b> <b>apron).</b> This process is not well understood and theoretically-based design guidelines for falling aprons are not available, only empirical relationships for bank revetments. Indicative laboratory experiments were conducted in order to derive guidelines to account for bed degradation {{in the design of}} rock protection at circular piers under currents. This paper summarizes the experimental set-up, monitoring techniques, test program and results of the conducted experiments. All tested rock protection layouts consisted of a single stone grading with a sufficient stone size and layer thickness to prevent shear failure and winnowing failure. In total, 7 live-bed tests were conducted with varying current velocities, bed degradation levels and rock layouts. During the tests, the bed protection level near the pier was monitored with video cameras. Before and after each test, the bathymetry was recorded by stereo-photography. The analysis focussed on the successive failure stages, the redistribution of stones over the slope and the evolution in time. The results showed that, as the undermining progressed, the stones {{at the edges of the}} protection were redistributed through a combination of rolling, sliding and sinking. Finally, a protective mound was formed, with stones covering the slopes on all sides. The observed stone layer thickness on the slopes gradually reduced towards the outside. A design rule was derived to account for bed degradation by quantifying the stone volume required for a <b>falling</b> <b>apron.</b> Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|The Durban Harbour, {{run by the}} National Ports Authority of South Africa (NPA), is {{the largest}} harbour in South Africa. To stay {{competing}} in the 21 st century the harbour entrance must be widened and deepened for the entry of Post Panamax ships. An {{important part of the}} Durban Harbour entrance Widening and Deepening project is the demolition of the existing North Groyne at the harbour entrance and the construction of a New North Groyne approximately 100 meters to the north. Preliminary research was already conducted by PRDW (PTY) LTD. A suitable construction method for the removal of the existing groyne and construction of the New North Groyne has been executed. Based on this construction method a design of the New North Groyne has been made. The design is tested on wave-structure interaction failure mechanisms and slope stability, including liquefaction potential, and is considered safe.

40|$|In 1997 the Jamuna Bridge was {{finished}} and came into use. As this bridge is a shore connection {{for one of}} the largest rivers in the world, extensive river training works were designed and built, mainly to avoid outflanking of the bridge by the river. It was especially the braiding character of the river with its ever-changing pattern, which made it difficult to predict the morphological behaviour. The river training works incorporated two guide-bunds, which lead the river through the contraction at the location of the bridge. This made it possible to cross the flood plain by constructing earthen abutments, leaving a bridge span of 5 km instead of 15 km. The narrowing of the river will lead to morphological changes. Deepening of the riverbed by means of local scour can be expected. To protect the toe of the revetment against this scour, a more or less traditional solution has been applied: the <b>falling</b> <b>apron.</b> A <b>falling</b> <b>apron</b> is a stack of granular material at the toe of a revetment, which will launch onto the slope of the scour hole when the revetment is undermined. The established slope will then be protected by a layer of rock, which will retain the bed material and prevent the formation of a slope that is too steep. To understand more about the setting process and to determine the resulting slope, a physical model was built and tested in a flume. Three different rock sizes were examined and two different initial configurations. It was found that the slope angle after setting was 1 : 2 for all experiments. Surprisingly, only a small amount of apron rock was actually used. This was because just a single layer of material covered the scour slope. This single layer does not retain the material like a properly designed filter, but it does slow down the erosion of sand from under the apron. Two parts of the <b>falling</b> <b>apron</b> were discerned: the waiting part consisting of the stack of unused material and the 'launched part', which is the rock layer covering the slope. This single layer has important consequences for the functioning of the apron. The grading used at the Jamuna Bridge was extra wide. The idea was that when a thick layer was launched on the slope, the fines would wash out of the top layer. A filter structure would then develop with large grains in the upper layer and fines (and large grains) in the lower layer. This theoretical case was not found in the model. The resulting slope appeared to have settled evenly and over the complete scour depth. No unprotected sand slope was observed during the experiments. The rock layer follows the bed level and extra rock is added from the waiting part of the apron when the layer slides down. This mechanism of scour at the toe and rock launching at the top implies that sand transport through the layer also occurs. The consecutive phases in the setting process showed that at different times the apron slopes lie parallel and retreat as a whole with the edge of the waiting apron. The survey data, retrieved since the Jamuna Bridge was built, were used to compare the model results with a prototype. These profiles also showed an apron slope of 1 : 2. However the thickness of the layer cannot be determined from the data. It can be seen that the apron slope follows the edge of the waiting part as it does in the model.

40|$|The {{rivers in}} the South-West of The Netherlands flow over an erosion-resistant bed, {{consisting}} of peat and clay, overlying non-cohesive sediments. As they are experiencing general incision, the erosion resistant layer becomes thinner and sometimes locally breaks, exposing the more easily eroded non-cohesive sediments. Consequently sudden scour holes may be formed that can pose {{risks to the}} stability of nearby flood defences. Mobile bed laboratory experiments were carried out to study the corresponding scour process, using a local opening in steel plates to represent a broken erosion-resistant top layer. I found that once the scour hole extends {{to the edge of}} the top layer, this layer is undermined. As a result, the sediment is only transported in suspension and although the turbulence within the scour hole is increasing, the rate of scour decreases. With the stiff steel plates at a fixed location the scour hole approaches an equilibrium depth. However, undermining in the field, will eventually lead to failure of the top layer and consequent growth of the horizontal extent of the scour hole. But not all scour holes in the field are growing, indicating other processes. This raised the assumption that the poorly erodible layer can also fail by deformation and covers the slopes of the scour hole; thus functions as a <b>falling</b> <b>apron.</b> Numerical computations with FINEL 3 D showed the shear stresses at bed of the scour hole. High shear stresses were observed at the edges and inner slopes of the scour hole. These shear stresses exceeded the critical shear stress of sand, which indicated that the slope are protected by the poorly erodible layer. Field research has to be carried out to validate the models and the proposition of the behaviour of the poorly erodible top layer.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the behaviour of a granular scour protection around piles when the bed is subjected to bed degradation. Furthermore, engineering guidelines are provided to account for bed degradation {{in the design of}} the initial scour protection. To address the behaviour of the protection, a physical model is used and to obtain the engineering guidelines, a theoretical approach is used which includes the phenomena that are observed during the physical model tests. As stated by many authors [Breusers et al., 1991; Chiew, 2004; Melville et al., 2000], a granular scour protection around a pile can fail due to several mechanisms. In clear-water conditions these mechanisms include shear failure, winnowing and edge scour and in live-bed conditions two other mechanisms can be added, namely bed degradation and bed form induced failure. This {{research focuses on}} the bed degradation mechanism, which can endanger the granular scour protection around a pile. Just like Van der Hoeven [2002] observed during his research on <b>falling</b> <b>aprons,</b> the stones spread evenly over the front and side slopes of the mound, which form after undermining of the protection has led to the ‘falling’ of the edge stones of the protection. This coverage of stones on the slopes of the mound effectively rearmoured the slopes and prevented further erosion. At the back of the mound this rearmouring is not observed, because the high turbulence levels, introduced by both the mound and the pile, caused stones to become unstable in this area. Furthermore, at the front and side slopes, where the slope of the mound was totally covered by the stones of the protection, the slope angles were constant and comparable to the slope angles that Van der Hoeven found in his research, namely 1 : 2, 0. However, a remarkable difference between the observations of Van der Hoeven and the observations of the current research concerns the layer thickness of the protection on the slope. Van der Hoeven observed that the layer thickness after launching of the apron was only 1 *df, 50 thick, while the current observations show a decreasing layer thickness from the top of the slope to the toe of the mound. The theoretical approach that is used to develop a design formula focuses on the side slopes, where the flow is parallel to the interface between stones and base material. A balance between the volume of the initial protection and the required volume of stones after bed degradation has led to the formulation of the internal slope angle, ?. This angle describes the assumed linearly decreasing thickness along the slope, starting with a certain required thickness at the top, Df,A, to a thickness of only 1 *df, 50 at the bottom. Because the hydraulic load decreases with increasing distance from the pile and the thickness of the initial protection is based on the maximum load near the pile, the assumption that Df,A is equal to the initial thickness of the protection, leads to a conservative design formula. This approach is however taken in the development of the simplified design formula, which results in a linear relation between the bed degradation and the extra extent of the initial protection that should be constructed to deal with that bed degradation.
