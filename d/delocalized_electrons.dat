5|$|Metals make {{relatively}} good conductors of heat, primarily because the <b>delocalized</b> <b>electrons</b> {{are free to}} transport thermal energy between atoms. However, unlike electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity of a metal is nearly independent of temperature. This is expressed mathematically by the Wiedemann–Franz law, which states that the ratio of thermal conductivity to the electrical conductivity {{is proportional to the}} temperature. The thermal disorder in the metallic lattice increases the electrical resistivity of the material, producing a temperature dependence for electric current.|$|E
5|$|At a given temperature, each {{material}} has an electrical conductivity that determines {{the value of}} electric current when an electric potential is applied. Examples of good conductors include metals such as copper and gold, whereas glass and Teflon are poor conductors. In any dielectric material, the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms and the material behaves as an insulator. Most semiconductors have a variable level of conductivity that lies between the extremes of conduction and insulation. On the other hand, metals have an electronic band structure containing partially filled electronic bands. The presence of such bands allows electrons in metals to behave {{as if they were}} free or <b>delocalized</b> <b>electrons.</b> These electrons are not associated with specific atoms, so when an electric field is applied, they are free to move like a gas (called Fermi gas) through the material much like free electrons.|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study is}} made of current distributions in finite-width Hall bars with disorder and some theoretical observations are verified. The equilibrium current and the Hall current are substantially different in distribution. It is observed that in the Hall-plateau regime the Hall current tends to concentrate near the sample edges while it diminishes on average in the sample interior {{as a consequence of}} localization. The edge states themselves scarcely affect both the equilibrium and Hall currents in the plateau regime. The sample edge combines with disorder to efficiently <b>delocalize</b> <b>electrons</b> near the edge while the Hall field competes with disorder to <b>delocalize</b> <b>electrons</b> in the sample interior. A possible mechanism is suggested for the breakdown of the quantum Hall effect. Comment: 10 pages, Revtex, 10 figures, to appear in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R
