5|$|After I {{released}} my solo record I {{felt really}} disappointed, I {{believed in the}} record I made but if you don't have the back-up of your record company investing and marketing it. It's a really tough job and because <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>the</b> whole thing I really believed in this record, as did Nellee Hooper, I was jaded and disappointed.|$|E
5|$|I {{really wanted}} {{to sit down with}} Wale before <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>the</b> hook, because to me, it's really lame when people send you tracks, and they're like, 'All right, Gaga, throw your vocals on it.' This is Wale's record. It's not my record. It's one of those songs, one of those tracks and one of those videos that you can't stop {{listening}} to.|$|E
5|$|Harihara, (also {{known as}} Harisvara) a Lingayati writer and the patron of King Narasimha <b>I,</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>the</b> Girijakalyana {{in the old}} Jain Champu style which {{describes}} the marriage of Shiva and Parvati in ten sections. He {{was one of the}} earliest Virashaiva writers who {{was not part of the}} vachana literary tradition. He came from a family of accountants (Karanikas) from Halebidu and spent many years in Hampi writing more than one hundred ragales (poems in blank verse) in praise of Virupaksha (a form of Shiva). Raghavanka was the first to introduce the Shatpadi metre into Kannada literature in his Harishchandra kavya which is considered a classic even though it occasionally violates strict rules of Kannada grammar.|$|E

The Rashtrakutas were responsible for building some of the beautiful rock-cut temples of Ellora including the Kailasa temple.

500|$|Actor and playwright Tony Roper wrote a play {{entitled}} Celts in Seville, {{the story}} of a typical Celtic supporting-family following Celtic over the course of their run to the UEFA Cup final in Seville. The play enjoyed a successful initial run in 2008, and a similarly successful rerun in 2014. Tony Roper wrote the play to highlight the passionate but good-natured support of Celtic fans during the UEFA Cup campaign, stating [...] "The reason I wrote this was not to celebrate Celtic not winning the UEFA cup, the reason <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>the</b> play was to celebrate Celtic supporters' way of not winning the cup." ...|$|E

And he was so amazing because there's a lot of producers you tell them things and they don't get it. And you're like oh, that's not the right way. He got it just right. He was amazing.

Karan added, [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>the</b> film, I realised that Yashvardhan Raichand is the backbone of the film and I could only see one actor playing the role — Amitabh Bachchan." [...] Bachchan, on his part, agreed to do the film without a script narration.

When I asked for permission to use the text I was refused, which was disappointing. I then wrote my own lyrics for the song, although I felt that the original idea had been more interesting. Well, I'm not James Joyce am I? When I came to work on this project I thought I would ask for permission again and this time they said yes." ...|$|E

Sometimes I'll have an idea for a lyrics.

That's why I tend to collaborate because I lose the ideas by the time I figure out the chord. All these melody ideas just go." ...|$|E
