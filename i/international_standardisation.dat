For this purpose, qualitative interviews were conducted with the aid of some visual material (a standardised advertisement in English).

50|$|The IDABC {{programme}} {{listed the}} efficient implementation of pan-European eGovernment services {{as an important}} purpose of SEMIC.eu. According to the website, the initial idea behind SEMIC.eu was “to {{make use of the}} knowledge already generated in other projects to the benefit of others”. As a network of eGovernment projects and communities, SEMIC.eu was open for participation to all stakeholders in the field of public services and eGovernment. The projects involved provided and re-used solutions for seamless data interchange, preserving the original meaning of the data. Data exchange methods were provided by stakeholders, harmonised and pooled. SEMIC.eu was also described as an implementation-oriented preparation for standardisation measures. Built upon its function as a facilitator of European harmonisation, the centre participated in <b>international</b> <b>standardisation</b> organisations. Another objective highlighted by the European Commission is the provision of scientific as well as practical information on all matters related to semantic interoperability.|$|E
