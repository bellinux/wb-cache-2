It {{is a small}} tree or shrub with spine-tipped branches and 200 – 600  cm high. It has a smooth leaf often described to be opposite sub-sessile, shaped elliptically and approximately lanceolate, with depressed veins {{that can be seen}} clearly from the dorsal surface (Labed et al. 2016; Semwal et al. 2014; Mehrdad et al. 2014). <b>Henna</b> <b>plants</b> are mostly cultivated in Egypt, Iran, Nigeria, Yemen, Algeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, etc. (Labed et al. 2016).

It is located at around [...] {{in the heart of}} the Ait Atta area. The village has about five hundred inhabitants. People live from agriculture. Despite the dry climate, wells produce sufficient water for the residents and for irrigation of the gardens. Tamsahelte and its region is well known for the good quality of the <b>henna</b> <b>plants</b> and dates. The language spoken in this region is Tamazight.The population is mostly elderly people. There is no industry or other means of earning money. Therefore younger people leave the village to look for a job in larger cities. In this way they can support their parents. The climate is very dry and it is hard to cultivate vegetables and sell them on the markets. To get some water to irrigate the gardens they have to dig deep. It is remarkable that farmers are only allowed to dig up to 40 meters, but in some areas farmers need to drill to a depth of 250 or 300 meters or even more to find the water they need. Usually this water is not drinkable.|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{describe}} {{the adverse effects}} of the leaf extract of Lawsonia inermis <b>plant</b> (<b>Henna),</b> extensively used for medicinal benefits in traditional Arab/African culture, on the histology of liver, kidney and spleen of male rats. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Place and Duration of Study: Biology Department, College of Science and Arts at Onaiza, Qassim University, Saudi Arabia, between August 2011 and November 2011. Methodology: Henna leaf solution was given to male rats at doses of 200 mg and 1000 mg/Kg/day {{for a period of}} six weeks/ 42 days. Rats were sacrificed {{at the end of the}} treatment period and their effects were studied specifically focusing on the histology of the liver, kidney and spleen; organs involved in detoxification, hematopoiesis and immune functions. Results & Conclusion: No pathological changes were evident at 200 mg dose for liver, kidney and spleen sections. However, significant pathological changes were observed in the liver and kidney at 1000 mg dose suggestive of degenerative or apoptotic changes. In view of these pathological relevant results, it is not advisable to use such high doses of Henna leaf extract in clinical formulations.

Petioles of several varieties were sectioned and stained with colorometric indicators: Vanillin HCl and the Hoepfner-Vorsatz test for phenolic compounds, and FeCl 3 and <b>Henna</b> for terpenoids. <b>Plant</b> Defense Mechanisms are both physical and chemical. The cuticle is a hydrophobic physical barrier but was also positive for Resorcinol (a phenolic compound). Plants have defense mechanisms that may deter herbivores.

Partially purified Hosta extract of three different varieties were macerated with methanol and combined.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the extract revealed the presence of anchoring groups and coloring constituents. Two different structures were prepared by chemical bath deposition (CBD) using zinc oxide (ZnO) layers to obtain ZnO nanowall (NW) or nanorod (NR) layers employed as a thin film at the photoanode side of the DSSC. The ZnO layers were annealed at different temperatures under various gas sources. Indeed, the forming gas (FG) (N 2 /H 2 95 : 5) was found to enhance the conductivity {{by a factor of}} 10 3 compared to nitrogen (N 2) or oxygen (O 2) annealing gas.

5000|$|Lawsone (2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), {{also known}} as hennotannic acid, is a red-orange dye present in {{the leaves of the}} <b>henna</b> <b>plant</b> (Lawsonia inermis) {{as well as in the}} flower of water {{hyacinth}} (Eichhornia crassipes). Humans have used henna extracts containing lawsone as hair and skin dyes for more than 5000 years. Lawsone reacts chemically with the protein known as keratin in skin and hair, in a process known as Michael addition, resulting in a strong permanent stain that lasts until the skin or hair is shed. The darker colored ink is due to more lawsone-keratin interactions occurring, which evidently break down as the concentration of lawsone decreases and the tattoo fades. [...] Lawsone strongly absorbs UV light, and aqueous extracts can be effective sunless tanning and sunscreens. Chemically, lawsone is similar to juglone, which is found in walnuts.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to study and compare the cytotoxic effect of the extracts of two <b>plants,</b> <b>henna</b> (Lawsonia inermis) and kejibeling (Strobilanthes crispus) on several kinds of cancer cell lines.

This {{research was}} done in vitro using several kinds of cancer cell lines such as human colon cancer cell lines (Caco- 2), liver cancer cell lines (HepG 2), hormone-dependent breast cancer cell lines (MCF- 7) and hormone-independent breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB- 231) and Chang Liver cell lines. The cytotoxic effect was measured through MTT assay and the potential cytotoxic value was calculated by determining the toxic concentration which may kill up to 50 % of the total cell used (IC 50). Meanwhile, the cytotoxic mechanism was studied by determining {{the effect of adding}} both extracts to the c-myc gene expression. The methods for determination were RT-PCR and sequencing process.

Kejibeling was also found to be cytotoxic against human liver cancer cell lines (HepG 2) and hormone-dependent breast cancer cell lines (MCF- 7) with an IC 50 -value of 0. 3 and 24. 8 μg mLG 1, respectively. However, the extract was not cytotoxic against human colon cancer cell lines (Caco- 2). The smallest value of IC 50 was seen when the kejibeling extract was compared with henna.
