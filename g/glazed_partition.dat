25|$|Almost all {{the cars}} were {{delivered}} with a two-class layout. A 12-seat first class saloon was located at the cab end of the car, a <b>glazed</b> <b>partition</b> behind the cab permitting forward (or rearward) views through the windscreen. A 32-seat second class (known as third class until 1956) saloon was positioned towards the gangway end, {{and there was also}} a guard's compartment and, in cars 2600–2647, a toilet. Cars 2648–2657 were intended for suburban use and devoid of toilets, permitting an extra four second class seats; apart from a lack of tables, they were otherwise identical to cars intended for longer-distance service. However, odd-numbered cars in this series subsequently had their guard's compartments removed to provide additional seating. Exceptionally, two cars (2658–2659) for use on the Waterford and Tramore Railway were delivered with high-density, single-class (although still divided into two saloons) layouts without toilets; the guard's compartment was also omitted from one car. Special trailer cars (see above) with similar high-density layouts operated with them. Most other cars were refitted with high-density, single-class layouts in the 1960s and early 1970s; these layouts seated between 70 and 91, depending on whether the toilet, guard's compartment or both were retained.|$|E
6000|$|If all {{the private}} {{accounts}} kept by those worthy bankers were like mine, where {{would have been}} Newcome Hall and Park Lane, Marblehead and Bryanstone Square? I used, by strong efforts of self-denial, to maintain a balance {{of two or three}} guineas untouched at the bank, so that my account might still remain open; and fancied the clerks and cashiers grinned when I went to draw for money. Rather than face that awful counter, I would send Larkins, the clerk, or Mrs. Flanagan, the laundress. As for entering the private parlour at the back, wherein behind the <b>glazed</b> <b>partition</b> I could see the bald heads of Newcome Brothers engaged with other capitalists or peering over the newspaper, I would as soon have thought of walking into the Doctor's own library at Grey Friars, or of volunteering to take an armchair in a dentist's studio, and have a tooth out, as of entering into that awful precinct. My good uncle, on the other hand, the late Major Pendennis, who kept naturally but a very small account with Hobsons', would walk into the parlour and salute the two magnates who governed there with the ease and gravity of a Rothschild. [...] "My good fellow," [...] the kind old gentleman would say to his nephew and pupil, [...] "il faut se faire valoir. I tell you, sir, your bankers like to keep every gentleman's account. And it's a mistake to suppose they are only civil to their great moneyed clients. Look at me. I go in to them and talk to them whenever I am in the City. I hear the news of 'Change, and carry it to our end of the town. It looks well, sir, to be well with your banker; and at our end of London, perhaps, I can do a good turn for the Newcomes." ...|$|E

50|$|Although the 1874 {{south and}} west timber {{verandah}}s and brick porch remain, the north verandah was added in 1914 {{at the same time}} as 24 pane composite windows were inserted into each of the three brick gables. Within the building, brick panels were removed and RSJ beams inserted to allow construction of the large <b>glazed</b> door <b>partition</b> to the northern verandah, and the opening into the southern porch area. The existing <b>glazed</b> <b>partitions</b> between classrooms were also constructed in 1914, contemporary with removal of the galleries and bricking-up of selected doors and windows.|$|R
50|$|A new double height atrium {{was created}} {{on the ground}} floor, and a new fifth and sixth floor were erected, while the seventh floor was {{extended}} as an open mezzanine. As a result, net lettable floor space was increased by 30%, from 12100 m2 to 15600 m2. Each floor can be subdivided into two spaces and the open balustrading has been replaced with partially <b>glazed</b> <b>partitions.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 1958 {{buildings}} {{included a}} parcels office below the main concourse, lifts and a corridor {{on the south}} side of the overbridge, divided from the passenger corridor by a <b>glazed</b> <b>partition.</b> To accommodate 12-car trains, the three old Racecourse island platforms were raised by 1 ft and extended to the north by about 100 ft, except for the very long westernmost platform, which was reduced from the south. The ticket office was able to handle 670 separate issues of Edmondson tickets from its Bellmatic equipment. The signalbox was retained on the centre platform.|$|E

5000|$|In listing it at Grade II*, Historic England note its [...] "smart Neo-Georgian {{exterior}} {{with good}} detailing and materials; design quality: contrasting aesthetic in the Oak and Walnut Bars, which epitomises the pluralistic approach to {{design in the}} inter-war years, and nostalgia for 'Merrie England'; planning: an archetypal inter-war improved road house {{with a range of}} rooms for different functions and clientele; intactness: virtually unaltered, high-quality interior complete with walnut or oak panelling, <b>glazed</b> <b>partitions,</b> bars, seating, stained glass, and fireplaces; suburban landmark: the pub exemplifies inter-war arterial development." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{ground floor}} {{internally}} has had most original dividing walls removed and {{various forms of}} portable <b>glazed</b> <b>partitioning</b> installed {{to create a new}} floor layout. Due to the introduction of air conditioning, false ceilings have been fitted throughout the floor effectively obscuring the original ceilings. The upper level is accessed via a set of narrow internal stairs located in the southern side of the building. The stairs lead to an L shaped corridor that, together with the stairwell, has a plasterboard ceiling and simple cornice. There are six rooms at the upper level of which several have the original timber lined ceiling. The floors throughout are either exposed timber boards or covered in vinyl. Original architraves and skirtings survive.|$|R
40|$|Different micro-optical {{structures}} {{have been}} developed for the application in transparent building elements like windows or <b>glazed</b> <b>partitions.</b> In cooperation with the Department of Microstructure Technology, TU Dortmund, as well as partners from research institutions and industry solutions for the following two tasks were elaborated: (1) two-sided structures on glass panes for redirection of direct sunlight into the depth of rooms improving daylighting; and (2) one-sided structures on clear panes, edge-lit by LED, for one-way and selective light emission. High demands were made on the small structures (50 – 200 [*]μm) as to efficiency of light redirection respectively light emission, and quality of image. Technologies for large scale manufacturing are developed in cooperation with partners from industry. Having tested laboratory samples (100 [*]mm[*]×[*] 100 [*]mm) successfully, larger prototypes are produced in hot embossing and UV embossing technique. Optimization of structure geometry and manufacturing process is continuing while design solutions for component and luminaire integration are developed. Architectural applications in transparent building elements for combined natural and artificial lighting are demonstrated, achieving high quality and low energy room illumination...|$|R

Vestibule has <b>glazed</b> panels to <b>partition</b> and swing doors with quarry glazing incorporating Art Nouveau motifs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interior}} {{has been}} altered but original fabric remains. The plan is organised about a central corridor with a polished plain concrete stair with metal balustrade {{in the south}} corner. The basement machine room is intact, retains a workshop use and is notable for the exposed timber structure of the floor above, arched brickwork and steel lifting beams (plated [...] "Manchester 1912"). The room may be viewed from the ground floor corridor above through arched brick windows. The ceiling to this corridor and through to 209A is sheeted with decorative pressed metal with stylised acanthus moulded cornices. Decorative pressed metal ceilings remain in several rooms and corridors. Room 306 retains exposed timber trusses and decorative pressed metal ceilings; room 405 remains as a galleried lecture theatre with decorative pressed metal ceilings; <b>glazed</b> timber <b>partitions</b> remain in room 202.|$|R
50|$|Schooling in {{this era}} {{strictly}} segregated boys from girls, with separate head teachers, class rooms, playgrounds, and entrances from the road. Boys and girls may have been on different floors. There was usually a third department for infants. Teaching was {{by a combination of}} formal teaching of large numbers by the head teacher in a main hall, with galleries to allow the whole department to attend, and tuition by pupil-teachers and assistant teachers in side classrooms. There were <b>glazed</b> or open <b>partitions</b> so that all teaching could be supervised by the head.|$|R

50|$|By 1913 {{the school}} {{enrolment}} numbered just over 200, and complaints were received regarding {{the inadequacy of}} the existing building. Plans were prepared, and a new building was mostly completed in 1914 by contractor GP Williams for £1 351. During construction of the new building, lessons were taught in the old residence and the playsheds, and held in the supper room of the Shire Hall during winter. The new building was described as:"A modern compact wooden building placed on high stumps with area under concreted, and batten enclosed. A <b>glazed</b> <b>partition</b> divides the infants' and main school rooms, {{both of which are}} cove-ceiled with stamped metal. Large gable windows, dormer and high verandah lights, give ample lighting and ventilation."The former school building was sold in 1914. The school residence was removed in 1915, and replaced by the present residence, completed in 1919.|$|E
50|$|The village became firmly {{established}} in the 13th century with the erection of the large All Saints church made of Kentish ragstone. Although it was extensively restored in the 1840s, it still boasts a 13th-century chancel and a famous brass of the 14th century, depicting a floriated cross design. It has an unusual four-faced clock and a spire which is 18 {{in out of the}} vertical at the top. The church has a peal of 6 bells, with its tenor bell weighing 3/4 ton. Several of the bells were cast at the Whitechapel foundry in London. The bells are rung from an oak framed platform at the tower end. The ringing {{can be seen from the}} main church through a large <b>glazed</b> <b>partition.</b> The tower is unusual as it houses four clock faces, an expensive addition at the time of installation, allowing the clock to be seen throughout the village.|$|E
5000|$|The {{house is}} {{one hundred and}} fifty feet in length from front to back, and of {{proportionate}} width. It is fitted up with great taste, and is divided by <b>glazed</b> <b>partitions</b> into four departments, for the various branches of the extensive business, which is there carried on. Immediately at the entrance is the first department, which is exclusively appropriated to the sale of furs and fans. The second contains articles of haberdashery of every description, silks, muslins, lace, gloves, &etc. In the third shop, on the right, you meet with a rich assortment of jewelry, ornamental articles in ormolu, french clocks, &etc.; and on the left, with all the different kinds of perfumery necessary for the toilette. The fourth is set apart for millinery and dresses; so that there is no article of female attire or decoration, but what may be here procured in the first style of elegance and fashion. This concern has been conducted for the last twelve years by the present proprietors who have spared neither trouble nor expense to ensure the establishment of a superiority over every other in Europe, and to render it perfectly unique in its kind. This venture is described as having all of the basic characteristics of the department store; it was a public retail establishment offering a wide range of consumer goods in different departments. This pioneering shop was closed down in 1820 when the business partnership was dissolved. All the major British cities had flourishing department stores by the mid-or late nineteenth century. Increasingly, women became the major shoppers and middle-class households. Kendals (formerly Kendal Milne & Faulkner) in Manchester lays claim to being one of the first department stores and is still known to many of its customers as Kendal's, despite its 2005 name change to House of Fraser. The Manchester institution dates back to 1836 but had been trading as Watts Bazaar since 1796. At its zenith the store had buildings on both sides of Deansgate linked by a subterranean passage [...] "Kendals Arcade" [...] and an art nouveau tiled food hall. The store was especially known for its emphasis on quality and style over low prices giving it the nickname [...] "the Harrods of the North", although this was due in part to Harrods acquiring the store in 1919. Other large Manchester stores included Paulden's (currently Debenhams) and Lewis's (now a Primark).|$|R
50|$|Because the {{building}} was originally a showroom, the interior was simply designed as a large open space and is therefore with subsequent renovation devoid of any features which suggest its early date. A 1970s office fitout has been inserted into {{the building}} and this comprises a central hall off which many small tenancies are accessed. These are formed with <b>glazed</b> and plasterboard <b>partitioning,</b> a suspended ceiling grid with fibrous cement panels, and a ceramic tiled floor. Many of the walls in the offices are veneered with acrylic timber cladding and carpeted. The rear section of the building, separated by a concrete wall is a large unceiled shed which extends to the Quay Lane boundary.|$|R
50|$|The plan works off {{the central}} living area which flows {{through to the}} {{southern}} extensions which accommodate dining, kitchen, laundry and bathroom. The north part of the living space opens through two sets of french doors onto an enclosed east verandah and through four-panelled timber doors to each of two bedrooms to the west. The walls and partitions to the north part of the living area and partitions to the bedrooms are of single skin post and rail construction with vertical tongue and groove timber boards. The west wall of bedroom two and part of bedroom one are lined with horizontal boards. A notch in the rail {{on the east side}} of bedroom one and the horizontal lining to the west may indicate the location of a previous partition. The ceilings of the bedrooms and living room are lined with narrow timber boards and have timber-framed sash windows with obscure patterned <b>glazing.</b> The <b>partitions</b> to the dining room and the kitchen and the east side of the south end of the living room are lined with vertical timber boards. The other partitions are lined with fibrous cement sheeting. The ceilings to these areas are lined with timber boards.|$|R

50|$|According to {{the history}} of Roxborough National School, Alexander W. Shaw {{established}} a school at a dwelling house in 1889. He was in residence at Roxborough House at this time and this dwelling was in fact the Gate Lodge of that house. This school catered for 64 pupils, 40 girls and 24 boys, and a Ms Briget O'Brien was the first teacher appointed. Construction began on a new school in 1911 and this was opened on 6 May 1912. It is a standard school building type of the period with two classrooms divided by timber and <b>glazed</b> <b>partition.</b> Each room had its own fireplace and the building was fronted by an entrance porch allowing separate access to each room. This building is now on the Limerick County Council list of protected structures. The school continued to grow and a number of prefabricated buildings were added to the site during the 1960s and 1970s. Extensive fund raising, led by the then Principal, Sean Marrinan, eventually led to a new school being constructed and opened in 1985.
