40|$|The {{entry of}} {{immigrants}} into their <b>incoming</b> <b>country</b> {{as well as}} their subsequent spread over the country's territory occurs through processes that have a strong spatial bias. The specific migration groups (here defined as the set of immigrants with the same country of origin) tend to reveal different levels and patterns of their spatial concentrations. The understanding of these similarities and dissimilarities in spatial behaviour is important task from both academic and policy perspective. This thesis has a quantitative character and {{it is based on the}} study of "spatial relatedness" of migration groups, which is defined as a rate, how much do given migration groups concentrate into the same regions. The thesis is based on a simple assumption that the spatial relatedness mirrors mutual proximity or similarity between these groups in other respects (e. g. cultural or economical). Plenty of datasets describing spatial distribution of migrants within 32 territorial systems on various scales (from global to local) are analysed. These systems will be analysed separately at first and then a synthesis of these partial results will be done with the aim to discover prevailing pattern of the spatial relatedness of migration groups. The assessments consists of several steps, which include particularly calculation of [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Tourism {{became one}} of the leading world {{industries}} thus provoking an interest among all countries, regardless the level of their economic development. Moreover, by increasing the number of <b>incoming</b> tourists, each <b>country</b> attempts to contribute to strengthening its economic growth. The paper addresses the economic impacts of tourism in Macedonia and makes an effort to assess its contribution to economic development. For that purpose, some commonly applied economic parameters are employed. The data set is observed in two sub-periods: 1991 - 2000 as a period just after the independence of Macedonia and 2001 - 2010 as a period extensive enough to observe the first tourism outcomes. The research generally is covered by comparative analyses based on available sources of secondary data. The outcomes point to modest contribution of tourism towards economic development, and underscores the necessity for managing actions and measures for enhancing current status. ...|$|R
40|$|We explore on {{the basis}} of a simple survey tool the {{perceived}} impact of the Erasmus mobility experience on the improvement of the thirty generic competences of the Tuning Europe list. We rely on a self-assessment procedure, i. e. on data collected by the Erasmus Office of the University of Padova, Italy, through end-of-stay questionnaires, as returned by both outgoing and incoming Erasmus students. Processed data yield the percentage number of ticks, by which a given competence was chosen by the answering samples. We introduce a quantity “importance of improvement”, which measures the perceived degree of development of a given generic competence during the mobility experience and allows a consistent comparison among different samples. On this basis, we can order the thirty competences according to decreasing perceived importance of improvement in the two above samples. From a general point of view, Erasmus students perceive the most important improvement in instrumental competences. We can then carry out meaningful comparisons between the profiles of competences’ improvement of outgoing and incoming students, both in qualitative and in quantitative terms. Such a comparison reveals interesting features linked to the academic and human environments of mobile students. A further step in the analysis describes how country effects give more insight into the previous results. In such a context, we analyze the country impact on each given competence for both outgoing (visiting the <b>country)</b> and <b>incoming</b> (from the <b>country)</b> students, on the country subgroup  competences’ profile and on the exchange of competences, which occurs between paired country subgroups. </p...|$|R
