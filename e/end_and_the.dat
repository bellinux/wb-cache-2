5|$|Another former West End standby, Ashleigh Gray, {{took over}} as Elphaba for the tour's second {{contract}} run, making her the second actress after Davis-Jones to have played the role in both the West <b>End</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> UK touring production. Originally, Davis-Jones was due to leave in order {{to return to the}} London company and lead its cast, however, it was later announced that, towards the end of her run in August 2014 she had withdrawn from the tour and subsequently would not be appearing in the West End.|$|E
5|$|Casino Royale premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square, the Odeon West <b>End</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Empire {{simultaneously}} in London on 14 November 2006. It marked the 60th Royal Film Performance and benefited the Cinema & Television Benevolent Fund (CTBF), whose patron, Queen Elizabeth II, was in attendance with the Duke of Edinburgh. It {{is the third}} James Bond premiere that the Queen attended, following You Only Live Twice and Die Another Day. Along with the cast and crew, numerous celebrities and 5,000 paying guests were also in attendance with half the proceeds benefiting the CTBF.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rest}} of 1932 Gielgud played in a new piece, Musical Chairs by Ronald Mackenzie, and {{directed}} one new and one classic play, Strange Orchestra by Rodney Ackland in the West <b>End,</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Merchant of Venice at the Old Vic, with Malcolm Keen as Shylock and Ashcroft as Portia. In 1932 he starred in Richard of Bordeaux by Elizabeth MacKintosh. This, a retelling in modern language {{of the events of}} Richard II, was greeted as the most successful historical play since Shaw's Saint Joan nine years earlier, more faithful to the events than Shakespeare had been. After an uncertain start in the West End it rapidly became a sell-out hit and played in London and on tour over the next three years.|$|E

5|$|Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance is a {{tactical}} role-playing video {{game in which}} players control protagonist Ike {{and a group of}} characters across multiple battle scenarios. At the game's opening, multiple difficulty settings can be chosen: in the Japanese version the options are Normal, Hard, and Maniac modes, while the western version has Easy, Normal, and Hard modes. In all modes, characters who fall in battle cannot be revived, being removed {{from the rest of the}} game, and no revival items can be used on them during a battle. If Ike falls in battle, the game will <b>end</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> stage must be restarted.|$|E
5|$|In 1937 Reich {{began an}} affair with a female patient, an actress who had been married to a {{colleague}} of his. According to Sigurd Hoel, the analysis would stop because of the relationship, then the relationship would <b>end</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> analysis would start up again. The patient eventually threatened to go to the press, but was persuaded that it would harm her as much as it would Reich.

5|$|Napoleon III, {{who had a}} great {{admiration for}} all things Roman, visited the Pont du Gard in 1850 and took a close {{interest}} in it. He approved plans by the architect Charles Laisné to repair the bridge in a project which was carried out between 1855–58, with funding provided by the Ministry of State. The work involved substantial renovations that included replacing the eroded stone, infilling some of the piers with concrete to aid stability and improving drainage by separating the bridge from the aqueduct. Stairs were installed at one <b>end</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> conduit walls were repaired, allowing visitors to walk along the conduit itself in reasonable safety.|$|E
5|$|The Briarcliff Manor Public Library {{is located}} on {{the eastern edge of the}} Walter W. Law Memorial Park on Library Road, and has a large parking lot {{accessible}} from Library Road. The site is near the library's first and third locations and borders the pool that was constructed using funds from the sale of the Community Center. The current structure consists of the 1.5-story former train station on the south <b>end</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two-story extension on the north side.|$|E
5|$|The County Ground was {{originally}} home to Taunton Cricket Club, which {{was formed in}} 1829 and played at the County Ground until 1977 before moving to Moorfields, Taunton in conjunction with Taunton Vale Hockey Club, after which the County Ground has been solely used by Somerset County Cricket Club. Somerset CCC was formed in 1875, but the club did not achieve first class status until 1891. The County Ground has a capacity of 8,500 and the ends are called the River <b>End</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Old Pavilion End. It is the current home of the England women's cricket team. The Somerset Cricket Museum is situated by the County Ground.|$|E

5|$|The {{ground is}} known for the {{artificial}} playing surface which was present from 1985 to 1991, the unusual entrance to the Oak Road <b>End,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> five-season ban on away supporters that Luton Town imposed following a riot by visiting fans in 1985. Floodlights were fitted in 1953, and the ground became all-seated in 1986. The record attendance of 30,069 was set in 1959, in an FA Cup sixth round replay against Blackpool.|$|E
5|$|The liquid thermal {{diffusion}} process {{was based on the}} discovery by Carl Ludwig in 1856 and later Charles Soret in 1879, that when a temperature gradient is maintained in an originally homogeneous salt solution, after a time, a concentration gradient will also exist in the solution. This is generally known today as the Soret effect. David Enskog in 1911 and Sydney Chapman in 1916 independently developed the Chapman–Enskog theory, which explained that when a mixture of two gases passes through a temperature gradient, the heavier gas tends to concentrate at the cold <b>end</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lighter gas at the warm end. This was experimentally confirmed by Chapman and F.W. Dootson in 1916.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{capacity of}} St Andrew's was reported as 75,000, with 4,000 {{seats in the}} Main Stand and space for 22,000 under cover. By 1938 the official capacity was 68,000, and February 1939 saw the attendance record set at the fifth round FA Cup tie against Everton, variously recorded as 66,844 or 67,341. On {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War, the Chief Constable ordered the ground's closure because of the danger from air raids; it was the only ground to be thus closed, and was only re-opened after the matter was raised in Parliament. It was badly damaged during the Birmingham Blitz: the Railway <b>End</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Kop as a result of bombing, while the Main Stand burnt down when a fireman mistook petrol for water.|$|E

5|$|The {{replacement}} Main Stand used a propped {{cantilever roof}} design, which meant fewer pillars to block spectators' {{view of the}} pitch. Floodlights were installed in 1956, and officially switched on for a friendly match against Borussia Dortmund in 1957. By the early 1960s a stand had been built at the Railway End to the same design as the Main Stand, roofs had {{been put on the}} Kop and Tilton Road <b>End,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ground capacity was down to about 55,000.|$|E
5|$|The thermal {{diffusion}} process was based on Sydney Chapman and David Enskog's theory, which explained that when a mixed gas passes through a temperature gradient, the heavier one tends to concentrate at the cold <b>end</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lighter one at the warm end. Since hot gases tend to rise and cool ones tend to fall, this {{can be used as}} a means of isotope separation. This process was first demonstrated by H. Clusius and G. Dickel in Germany in 1938. It was developed by US Navy scientists, but was not one of the enrichment technologies initially selected for use in the Manhattan Project. This was primarily due to doubts about its technical feasibility, but the inter-service rivalry between the Army and Navy also played a part.|$|E
