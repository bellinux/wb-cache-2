40|$|Abstract—The Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication kernel {{exhibits}} limited {{potential for}} {{taking advantage of}} modern shared memory architectures due to its large memory bandwidth requirements. To decrease memory contention and improve {{the performance of the}} kernel we propose two compression schemes. The first, called CSR-DU, targets the reduction of the matrix structural data by applying coarse grain delta encoding for the column indices. The second scheme, called CSR-VI, targets the reduction of the numerical values using <b>indirect</b> <b>indexing</b> and can only be applied to matrices which contain a small number of unique values. Evaluation of both methods on a rich matrix set showed that they can significantly improve the performance of the multithreaded version of the kernel and achieve good scalability for large matrices.

40|$|In this research, we have {{implemented}} a parallel EP on consumer-level graphics processing units and proposed <b>indirect</b> <b>indexing</b> and many optimization skills to achieve maximal efficiency. The parallel EP is {{a hybrid of}} masterslave and fine-grained models. Competition and selection are performed by CPU (i. e. the master) while fitness evaluation, mutation, and reproduction are performed by GPU which is essentially a massively parallel machine with shared memory. Unlike other fine-grained parallel computers such as Maspar, GPU allows processors to communicate with, not only nearby processors, but also any other processors. Hence more flexible fine-grained EAs can be implemented on GPU. We have done experiments to compare our parallel EP on GPU and an ordinary EP on CPU. It is found that the speed-up factor of our parallel EP ranges from 1. 25 to 5. 02, when the population size is large enough. Moreover, there is a sub-linear relation between the population size and the execution time. Thus, our parallel EP will be very useful for solving difficult problems that require huge population sizes. For future work, we plan to implement a parallel genetic algorithm on GPU and compare it with the approach reported in this paper...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Patients {{treated for}} nonfunctioning {{pituitary}} macroadenomas (NFMAs) have fatigue and alterations in sleep characteristics and sleep-wake rhythmicity frequently. As NFMAs often compress the optic chiasm, these complaints might {{be related to}} dysfunction of the adjacent suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). We aimed to explore whether <b>indirect</b> <b>indices</b> of SCN functioning are altered in the long term after surgery for NFMAs. METHODS: We studied 17 NFMA patients in long-term remission after transsphenoidal surgery, receiving adequate and stable hormone replacement for hypopituitarism, and 17 control subjects matched for age, gender, and BMI. <b>Indirect</b> <b>indices</b> of SCN function were assessed from 24 -h ambulatory recordings of skin and core body temperatures, blood pressure, and salivary melatonin levels. Altered melatonin secretion was defined as an absence of evening rise, considerable irregularity, or daytime values > 3  pg/ml. We additionally studied eight patients treated for craniopharyngioma. RESULTS: Distal-proximal skin temperature gradient did not differ between NFMAs and control subjects, but proximal skin temperature was decreased during daytime (P= 0. 006). Core body temperature and non-dipping of blood pressure did not differ, whereas melatonin secretion was often altered in NFMAs (OR 5. 3, 95 % CI 0. 9 - 30. 6). One or more abnormal parameters (≥ 2. 0 SDS of control subjects) were observed during nighttime in 12 NFMA patients and during daytime in seven NFMA patients. Similar patterns were observed in craniopharyngioma patients. CONCLUSION: Heterogeneous patterns of altered diurnal rhythmicity in skin temperature and melatonin secretion parameters were observed in the majority of patients treated for NFMAs. On a group level, both NFMA and craniopharyngioma patients showed a lower daytime proximal skin temperature than control subjects, but other group averages were not significantly different. The observations suggest altered function of central (or peripheral) clock machinery, possibly by disturbed entrainment or damage of the hypothalamic SCN by the suprasellar macroadenoma or its treatment...|$|R
