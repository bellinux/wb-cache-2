The results of numerical and experimental researches of the masonry filling behavior at the <b>frame</b> <b>twist</b> and deflection of the supporting structures have been presented.

The necessity of adjusting the standards concerning the limits of floor deflections, against which the masonry walls and partitions abut, has been noted.

40|$|Determining {{the mass}} of a vehicle from ground based passive sensor data is {{important}} for many security and traffic safety reasons. A vehicle consists of multiple dependent and independent systems that each respond differently to changes in vehicle mass.

If these remotely sensed system responses are correlated to the vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s mass, and the required vehicle parameters were known, {{it would be possible}} to calculate {{the mass of}} the vehicle as a function of these responses. The research described here investigates multiple vehicle phenomenologies and their correlation to vehicle load. Brake temperature, engine acoustics, exhaust output, tire temperature, tire deformation, vehicle induced ground vibration, suspension response, and engine torque induced <b>frame</b> <b>twist</b> were all evaluated and assessed as potential methods of remotely measuring a vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s mass. Extensive field experiments were designed and carried out using multiple sensors of various types; including microphones, accelerometers, high-speed video cameras, high-resolution video cameras, LiDAR, and thermal imagers. These experiments were executed at multiple locations and employed passenger vehicles, and commercial trucks with loads ranging from zero to beyond the recommended load capacity of the vehicle. The results of these experiments were used to determine if the signature for each phenomenology could be accurately observed remotely, and if so, how well they correlated to vehicle mass. The suspension response and engine torque induced <b>frame</b> <b>twist</b> phenomenologies were found to have the best correlation to vehicle mass of the phenomenologies considered, with correlation values of 90. 5...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes an {{algorithm}} for robotic kinematic calibration {{based on}} a minimal product of exponentials (POE) -based model for the applications where only position measurements are required. Both joint zero-offset errors and initial <b>frame</b> <b>twist</b> error can {{be involved in this}} model. Analysis of the identifiability of these errors shows that at most six elements of these parameters can be identified. It also suggests that at least three noncollinear points on the end-effector should be measured to maximize the identifiability. Compared with the traditional POE-based model with full pose (position and orientation) measurements, the minimal model with only position measurements outperforms in terms of convenience, efficiency, and accuracy. Note to Practitioners-Kinematic calibration is pivotal to improve the position accuracy of a robot. To avoid the disadvantages of measuring the orientation of the end-effector during calibration, an algorithm using only position measurements is presented, with which one needs only position measurements of several points fixed on the end-effector without orientation information during the whole calibration process. This will greatly facilitate the scheme design as well as the practical operations. The identifiability of the parameters is then analyzed with two conclusions: 1) at most six elements of the joint zero-offsets and the initial <b>frame</b> <b>twist</b> in total can be identified simultaneously and 2) at least three points on the end-effector which are not collinear should be measured so as to make the identifiability maximum. According to these conclusions, one should carefully select parameters to formulate the error model and measure sufficient points on the end-effector during the calibration procedure...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the relationship between}} the first non-vanishing Milnor invariants of a classical link and the intersection invariant of a twisted Whitney tower. This is a certain 2 -complex in the 4 -ball, built from immersed disks bounded by the given link in the 3 -sphere together with finitely many `layers' of Whitney disks. The intersection invariant is a higher-order generalization of the intersection number between two immersed disks in the 4 -ball, well known to give the linking number of the link on the boundary, which measures intersections among the Whitney disks and the disks bounding the given link, together with information that measures the <b>twists</b> (<b>framing</b> obstructions) of the Whitney disks. This interpretation of Milnor invariants as higher-order intersection invariants {{plays a key role in}} the classifications of both the <b>framed</b> and <b>twisted</b> Whitney tower filtrations on link concordance (as sketched in this paper).

40|$|The twist is a {{fundamental}} geometric property of nucleic acids. Calculation of the twist in the most general case requires detailed specification of the three-dimensional path of each strand, but many important cases may be analyzed by considering only the twist difference. If C 1, C 2, and C 3 are three distinct space curves, the twist difference about C 1 is defined as Tw(C 3, C 1) - Tw(C 2, C 1). We show here that this difference measures {{the rotation of the}} correspondence surface joining C 1 to C 2 about the correspondence surface joining C 1 to C 3. This result has application to DNA containing local nonuniformities, such as denatured regions, cruciforms, and other altered structures. It also facilitates the calculation of twist for three-stranded structures, including D-loops in mitochondrial DNA and replication and transcription intermediates. The twist difference may also be used to simplify greatly the analysis of twist changes in duplex DNA due to winding on surfaces, such as histones and certain enzymes. In such cases the strand-axis twist of DNA divides into two independent terms. The first term arises from the twist of the local reference frame, and the second arises from the rotation of either strand about the duplex axis as measured in the local reference <b>frame.</b> <b>Twist</b> changes consequent to nucleosome winding, for example, arise from the twist of the nucleosome axis, a straight line, about the DNA axis plus the rotation of either strand of the DNA about its axis in the reference frame of the cylinder...|$|R
50|$|The tornado {{touched down}} at 3:40 PM CDT in northeastern Pickens County, Alabama, {{damaging}} a few chicken homes at EF1 strength. The tornado caused roof damage to houses and destroyed a few outbuildings before moving into Tuscaloosa County and briefly into Fayette County, causing major EF2 tree damage and minor structural damage. The tornado then moved back into Tuscaloosa County, causing mostly minor tree and structural damage at EF1 strength before rapidly intensifying and crossing into Fayette County once again. There, it completely destroyed {{at least one}} mobile home, with the frame being separated and the remaining debris being thrown a considerable distance. The tornado appeared to strengthen even further and several mobile homes were completely obliterated with debris thrown a considerable distance and <b>frames</b> <b>twisted</b> and thrown.

It then weakened to EF1 strength and caused mostly minor damage to trees and mobile homes. South of Oakman, numerous trees were snapped and uprooted, a cell phone tower was knocked down, and mobile homes were destroyed at EF2 intensity. It then rolled vehicles and destroyed a cinder block house to the southeast of Oakman, with damage rated EF3 at that location. The tornado weakened considerably as it approached Corridor X of the Appalachian Development Highway System, with only minor EF0 tree damage, before it strengthened significantly as it entered the town of Cordova as a 0.5 mi wide EF3.|$|R

Together with Milnor invariants, these higher-order invariants are shown to classify the existence of (twisted) Whitney towers of increasing order in the 4 -ball.
