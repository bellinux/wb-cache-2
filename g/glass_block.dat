All three are two-story, structures of reclaimed red brick, built in the International Style. The houses feature curved walls, low hip roofs, and steel casement and <b>glass</b> <b>block</b> windows. Each house has an attached single-car garage. The houses are tightly spaced, with a uniform setback, and the common backyard is enclosed with a red brick perimeter wall with no intermediate dividing walls. Benches and cantilevered stone shelves are incorporated Into the wall, as is a large outdoor grille and cooking stove. In {{the center of the}} backyard is a small concrete wading pool featuring two stylized snail sculptures, one {{at each end of the}} pool.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, Mesrobian {{designed}} the Calvert Manor, a twenty-two unit apartment building located at 1925-1927 North Calvert Street in Arlington, Virginia. It was {{designed in the}} Moderne style and the building itself was {{laid out in a}} symmetrical design. Though Mesrobian was the architect behind the apartment, he held its ownership. After his death in 1975, the entitlement to the property was passed on to his children. The three-story garden apartment building is constructed of concrete block with red brick facing, highlighted by light-colored cast stone, cement brick details, and vertical bands of <b>glass</b> <b>block.</b> It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on 15 December 1997.

30|$|It {{also could}} be seen that foam <b>glass</b> <b>blocks</b> in both {{the first and second}} group {{experienced}} no significant change in weight as well as appearance. This indicated the immersion in acid condensation or the exposure to cyclic wet-dry conditions had no significant effect on foam <b>glass</b> <b>blocks.</b> The minimal corrosion rates were 0.0580 and 0.0583  mm/y, denoting that foam <b>glass</b> <b>blocks</b> were very stable and were not selective to the outer environments. The excellent corrosion resistance could be explained by the protective silicon dioxide (SiO 2) and boron trioxide (B 2 O 3) layer formed above the surface during the experimental process (Soo Park et al. 1999). Obviously, simultaneous accumulation of SiO 2 and B 2 O 3 led to comparatively less loss of foam <b>glass</b> <b>blocks</b> on the <b>glass</b> surface.|$|R

500|$|The {{fountain}} uses [...] per hour, 97% {{of which}} is recycled back into the system. [...] Getting the water to the spout took ingenuity. Although consideration was given to omitting a LED tile, {{it was determined that}} the images would then look as though they were each missing a tooth. Instead, one tile in each tower is recessed about [...] to allow the installation of [...] clear tubing for the water nozzle. The water regularly spills over the fountain and down the sides of the towers and intermittently spouts from the nozzle. Two essential custom fittings contribute to the artistic vision of the fountain: a custom <b>glass</b> <b>block</b> at the upper edge for guiding the water's descent while remaining unobtrusive, and a plastic nozzle fitted to the stainless steel frame to control the rate of water flow and reduce liability to the city for any injuries sustained by the fountain's interactive participants. The interactive participants are usually children playing in the stream from the water spout or under the cascade. The risk that the spouting water would knock people down made the design both a legal and a physical challenge.|$|E

2500|$|With a {{new middle}} school {{building}} completed on Badin Road in 2003, the former middle school building {{was expected to}} house 500 students, with larger classrooms than many schools had, and kindergarten and first-grade students would have classes on the first floor.

Architect Steve Onxley, {{who worked on the}} new project, said, [...] "his building was years ahead of most of the buildings of its time." [...] School buildings tended to be well built because of the value of a high school education at the time, equivalent to a junior college years later.

2500|$|Lakeside Hall was {{converted}} into a new ballroom which could seat 4,000 people. Service space between the Great Hall and Lakeside Hall {{was converted}} into a new lobby, with staircase access to the surface above. The contemporarily-styled lobby had an illuminated ceiling the mimicked a skylight. The steel columns in the space were plastered, and one bare concrete wall covered with a new decoration of sculpted <b>glass</b> <b>block</b> and stone. A corner kiosk in the lobby doubled as a registration desk and a bar. A new monumental staircase, echoing {{the look of the}} staircase in Public Auditorium, was built to connect the lobby with the new banquet hall. Rather than the traditional plush look, the ballroom space was designed with an industrial feel that helped unite it visually with the Great Hall. Industrial ceiling lights, covered in Teflon fabric and perforated metal wall sconces helped to light the space. The walls remained raw concrete. To help eliminate the underground feel of the space, the north wall with its three-door railroad loading dock was removed, and a new glass curtain wall installed. [...] To improve the view of Lake Erie beyond, a retaining wall outside the facility was lowered.

6000|$|... 494. A glass basin (fig. 52.), {{four inches}} in {{diameter}} and four inches deep, had a division of mica a, fixed across the upper part so as to descend one {{inch and a half}} below the edge, and be perfectly water-tight at the sides: a plate of platina b, three inches wide, was put into the basin {{on one side of the}} division a, and retained there by a <b>glass</b> <b>block</b> below, so that any gas produced by it in a future stage of the experiment should not ascend beyond the mica, and cause currents in the liquid on that side. A strong solution of sulphate of magnesia was carefully poured without splashing into the basin, until it rose a little above the lower edge of the mica division a, great care being taken that the glass or mica on the unoccupied or c side of the division in the figure, should not be moistened by agitation of the solution above the level to which it rose. A thin piece of clean cork, well-wetted in distilled water, was then carefully and lightly placed on the solution at the c side, and distilled water poured gently on to it until a stratum the eighth of an inch in thickness appeared over the sulphate of magnesia; all was then left for a few minutes, that any solution adhering to the cork might sink away from it, or be removed by the water on which it now floated; and then more distilled water was added in a similar manner, until it reached nearly to the top of the glass. In this way solution of the sulphate occupied the lower part of the glass, and also the upper on the right-hand side of the mica; but on the left-hand side of the division a stratum of water from c to d, one inch and a half in depth, reposed upon it, the two presenting, when looked through horizontally, a comparatively definite plane of contact. A second platina pole e, was arranged so as to be just under the surface of the water, in a position nearly horizontal, a little inclination being given to it, that gas evolved during decomposition might escape: the part immersed was three inches and a half long by one inch wide, and about seven-eighths of an inch of water intervened between it and the solution of sulphate of magnesia.|$|E
30|$|As {{illustrated}} in Fig.  2, {{it can be}} concluded that FRP and ND steel are the two materials that went through most dramatic weight loss after immersed in the acid condensation. Polyurea and VEGF also underwent minor weight loss, while there was almost no change for titanium alloy and foam <b>glass</b> <b>blocks</b> under the same experimental conditions. These results are in consistent with those under the cyclic wet-dry environments. As for VEGF, the corrosion rate was as high as around 2.02  mm/y; whereas for ND steel, FRP and polyurea, it was respectively 1.21, 1.19 and 1.12  mm/y, indicating the cyclic wet-dry environments placed a great damage to these four materials. Least loss occurred to titanium alloy and foam <b>glass</b> <b>blocks.</b> Titanium alloy was always stable in both corrosion environments mainly because of the formed adherent and protective surface oxidation films when implanted with different elements. Foam <b>glass</b> <b>blocks</b> embraced excellent corrosion resistance due to the formation and protection of SiO 2 and B 2 O 3 layers.|$|R

30|$|Owing to {{its ability}} of surface {{restoration}} at elevated temperatures, foam <b>glass</b> <b>blocks</b> {{had the potential}} for use in corrosive environments in power plant. The higher corrosion loss was because of its porous structure, allowing easy acid penetration {{that led to the}} formation of cracks or open paths for corrosive attack. Instead, the slow corrosion rate of foam <b>glass</b> <b>blocks</b> was probably because of the formation of an oxidation layer of SiO 2 and B 2 O 3 on the material surface. A uniform layer could appreciably decrease the surface porosity and thereby improve the corrosion resistance. The deceased pores on the surface retarded the acid to penetrate and thus suppress the corrosive attack. The formed oxide layer had low porosity, making them less susceptible to corrosive degradation (Park et al. 2009; Keding et al. 2002; Littner et al. 2006). In other words, through pore-filling and planarization, the layer could improve the densification of the surface, and consequently, the corrosion resistance. The surface layer acted as a barrier to the corrosive environment for the foam <b>glass</b> <b>blocks,</b> which enhanced the corrosion resistance of the material in power plant stacks.|$|R
