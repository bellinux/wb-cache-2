500|$|Madonna's vocal range spans {{almost one}} octave from F3 to D4. As {{she begins to}} sing the first verse, the bass pedal changes to C major, changes back to F during the chorus, and back to D minor during the chorus closure. This process is {{repeated}} during the second verse and chorus, which abruptly ends in a silence, with only the low and lifeless sound of the synthesizer, set in D minor. Madonna then starts to sing the bridge (or middle part)— [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>away,</b> I'd never have the strength"— between the tonal keys of D and F, closing with the repetition of the chorus until the song gradually fades out. The original composition of the song {{did not have the}} background synths, instead Leonard created a basic structure on piano, and Madonna added the words on top of it. According to Leonard, Madonna came up with the bridge by herself, extending it from the music that he was playing.|$|E
500|$|The band {{performed}} in the UK in April 1982. NME considered that the show [...] "was all very skillfully deployed: a bruisingly clear sound of scathing force, a clockwork, Pavlovian lightshow, a variegation of light and shade in the song order that builds to the unmitigating force of 'Pornography' itself as the climax". However, the mood on stage was not good: The journalist noted that Smith looked [...] "dejected and tired" [...] for his birthday. Behind the scene, Smith's relationship with Gallup was deteriorating. When the tour reached Europe, tension was so high between the two musicians {{that they had a}} fight after a concert in Strasbourg. Tolhurst found out the next day that his two partners [...] "had both gone back to England". At home, Smith heard his father telling him: [...] "Get right back out on that tour! People have bought tickets!" [...] After two more weeks of touring, the band played their final show in Brussels. Tolhurst later related: [...] "I remember sitting in the dressing room thinking, 'oh well, that's the end of the band, then' [...] I went off to France for a bit. I guess <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>away.</b> Escaping from the reality of The Cure". Back in England, Smith took a rest with a month's camping holiday to the Lake District to [...] "clean up".|$|E
500|$|Lafourcade {{launched}} a promotional tour throughout Mexico and only performed at theaters {{that were at}} least 100 years old. The Village Voice, reporting on an interview with Lafourcade, noted, [...] "There are enough such grand old structures in her country to make this possible", although according to Lafourcade, [...] "some of them are better maintained than others." [...] The [...] "Hasta la Raíz Tour" [...] opened in Tijuana on April18, 2015, and also visited several cities in the United States such as San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and New York City. In Hollywood, Lafourcade participated on the Latin Grammy Acoustic Sessions at the Fonda Theatre. A few dates in Argentina, Chile, Italy, and Spain were announced; however, her record label, Sony Music, announced that due to illness the performance in Spain, set for June, would be canceled. In September, Lafourcade performed at [...] "Festival DCODE 2015" [...] in Madrid, Spain. The singer also visited Colombia on October1, 2015, performing at Bogotá's Royal Center. On November4, 2015, Lafourcade fulfilled a long-held dream of performing {{for the first time}} at the Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City. [...] "I've been here with Julieta Venegas, and someone reminded me that I opened for Juanes a few years ago. When I was 13 years old, <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>away</b> from home with my best friend to come to the Auditorio Nacional to see Christina Aguilera, and I wanted to be on stage, longing to have this opportunity. After many years of work, this became a reality." [...] To further promote the album, Lafourcade became the first Mexican female singer-songwriter to record an acoustic session for the music streaming service Spotify. Titled Spotify Sessions, the live EP includes six tracks from Hasta la Raíz ("Para Qué Sufrir", the title track, [...] "Nunca Es Suficiente", [...] "Ya No Te Puedo Querer", [...] "Palomas Blancas", and [...] "No Más Llorar") and a cover version of Rafael Hernández's [...] "Silencio". Lafourcade performed [...] "Hasta la Raíz" [...] at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2015. Lafourcade also presented the tour in a sold-out show held at the Teatro Cariola in Santiago de Chile, Chile on November 25, 2015.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the start}} of World War I at the young age of 16, Brodovitch {{abandoned}} his dream of entering the Imperial Art Academy and {{ran away from home}} to join the Russian army. Not long after, his father had him brought home and hired a private tutor to help Alexey finish school. Upon graduating, Brodovitch ran away again on several occasions. He recalls: After a week or so <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>away</b> to the front line to kill Germans. But my father, now a military general {{at the head of a}} Red Cross hospital train, had plenty of influence, and I was soon brought back to him. On the train back I was employed as a nurses' aid. In East Prussia <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>away</b> again and joined a nearby regiment. Once again I was caught, and this time I was sent to an officers' school, the Corps de Pages. During the Russian Civil War, Brodovitch served with the White Army. While fighting against the Bolsheviks in Odessa, he was badly wounded and was hospitalized for a time in Kislovodsk, in the Caucasus. [...] In 1918, the town was surrounded by the Bolsheviks, forcing Brodovitch into exile. It was during this retreat to the south through Caucasus and Turkey that he met his future wife, Nina.|$|E

She used to hit me with anything, skillets, stove wood — (one time <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>away)</b> and cried for a week. Stayed in the woods, me and my little dog."

2500|$|Zaid welcomed Abdullah's {{announcement}} {{in spite of}} the lack of a formal apology, saying: [...] "(One) can say sorry in other ways." [...] George Seah's son told the press that although all his father wanted was an apology, the family would not reject any goodwill payments. Tan Sri Wan Suleiman Pawanteh's wife said: [...] "Although I thank the prime minister, I feel less than satisfied at his decision (not to make a straightforward apology). This {{is not the end of}} the story for me. (Without an apology) I don't know, people don't know, that my husband was not guilty. I want my husband's name to be cleared. I feel my husband was innocent. He was an honest judge...Even so, I am thankful that our prime minister cares about us enough (to do this much)." [...] Tan Sri Eusoffe Abdoolcader's granddaughter regretted that acknowledgement had been so late in coming: [...] "I wish he was here. He's the main person affected by all this. It's a different case from the others (Salleh and Wan Suleiman) because he was reinstated. It's been 12 years. It should have been solved earlier." [...] Tun Salleh Abas however welcomed Abdullah's statement, saying: [...] "I feel great. It was something I didn't expect. I suffered so much humiliation ... so much so <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>away</b> from the public and took solace in being a farmer." ...|$|E
