25|$|Furthermore, using a {{specially}} designed bioreactor, Titze et al. showed that fibroblasts exposed to mechanical stimulation have differing levels of ECM production from fibroblasts that are not exposed to mechanical stimulation. The gene expression levels of ECM constituents such as fibronectin, MMP1, decorin, fibromodulin, HA synthase 2, and CD44 were altered. All those genes are involved in ECM remodeling, thus suggesting that mechanical forces applied to the tissue, alter the expression levels of ECM related genes, which in turn allow the cells present in the tissue to regulate the ECM constituent synthesis, thus affecting the tissue’s composition, structure, and biomechanical properties. In the end, cell-surface receptors close the loop by <b>giving</b> <b>feedback</b> on the surrounding ECM to the cells, affecting also their gene expression level.|$|E

It is, more broadly, a set of ideas and practices that are focused on promoting spontaneity in human relations.

They {{strengthen}} the [...] "fun" [...] aspects and fixed or removed the unenjoyable ones, a process Sid Meier called [...] "surrounding the fun". After the revision, they played it again, repeating the cycle of revision and play. Playing the game repeatedly and in-depth was a rule at Firaxis. In the single-player mode, the team tried extreme strategies to find any sure-fire paths to victory and to see how often a particular computer faction ends up at the bottom. The goal {{was a product of}} unprecedented depth, scope, longevity, and addictiveness, where the player is always challenged by the game to come up with new strategies with no all-powerful factions or unstoppable tactics. According to Reynolds, the process has been around since Sid Meier's early days at Microprose. At Firaxis, as iterations continue, they expand the group <b>giving</b> <b>feedback,</b> bringing in outside gamers with fresh perspectives.

2500|$|The late philosopher George Molnar (1934–1999) {{published}} {{only four}} philosophical papers on metaphysics in his career, but his {{importance in the}} field should not be underestimated. [...] After {{a return to the}} field, following a self-imposed absence, he was working on a book ("") and continued up until his sudden and untimely death in August 1999. [...] The book remained unfinished until Mumford, who had previously been in contact with Molnar, in the summer of 1999, with the intention of <b>giving</b> <b>feedback</b> on the work (nearing completion), was approached to edit the remaining manuscript into a completed book. [...] Mumford, along with several other figures in the field of metaphysics, including David Armstrong, were involved collaboratively in providing insight on Molnar's work, and as a person, but the editing was left to Mumford, as was the writing of an introductory chapter to correctly present and establish the material laid out - something which Molnar did not get round to doing before his death. [...] Armstrong states, [...] "We can be very grateful to Stephen Mumford for making a volume from the much that we have. [...] His excellent introduction serves in place of the introductory chapter that was left unwritten". [...] Mumford had discussed Molnar at a conference on Australian metaphysics, held in Grenoble (9–13 December 1999), but the [...] - organised by Jean-Maurice Monnoyer, entitled [...] "The Structure of the World: Objects, Properties and States of Affairs" [...] - was to be the first official meeting of Mumford and Molnar as well. [...] Mumford had considered this {{to be the end of}} the matter, but, in the spring of 2000, Mumford was contacted again concerning [...] "". [...] This time, however, it was through mutual friend Tony Skillen (lecturer in philosophy at the University of Kent) on behalf of Molnar's former partner Carlotta McIntosh, who had given access to the manuscript and who shared it with Mumford. [...] Although the book was, in places, complete and filled with promise, there was much work to be done on the later chapters - Mumford reflects on a conversation between himself and Armstrong on the way to the Grenoble colloquium, mentioning Molnar's email stating the work was near finished, Armstrong replied: [...] "it was near finished, in his mind". [...] The main theory of powers survives, and with Mumford's help and editorial contribution is readily accessible.|$|E
