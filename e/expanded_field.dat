25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1923, the Cadet Corps, {{with a total of}} 2,091 cadets in twenty-three {{individual}} units, became divided between the Infantry Regiment and the Composite Regiment. The Composite Regiment included the Cavalry, Field Artillery, Air Service and Signal Corps units. The Air Corps Squadron (formerly Air Service Squadron) was phased {{out at the end of}} the 1927–28 school year. In {{the fall of}} 1928, with enrollment at 2,770 cadets, an Engineer Battalion was added, and the following year a third regiment was formed out of the <b>expanded</b> <b>Field</b> Artillery Battalion. A fourth battalion, the Coast Artillery, was added to the Composite Regiment in the fall of 1933.|$|E
2500|$|... "The City on the Edge of Forever" [...] was {{released}} on DVD paired with [...] "Errand of Mercy" [...] {{as part of the}} general release of the series in 2000, and as part of the season one DVD set in 2004. The episode was included in the remastered season one release on DVD and Blu-ray in 2009. The remastered version included revamped and expanded special effects by CBS Digital under the guidance of Dave Rossi, as well as Mike and Denise Okuda. Changes included an <b>expanded</b> <b>field</b> of ruins on the Guardian's planet, as well as updated visuals of the planet from space. Rossi explained that they sought to tie the purple cloth backdrop used in the original version into the redesign, but was concerned that the [...] "giant purplish desert flats" [...] as seen from space were instead misconstrued as oceans. [...] "The City on the Edge of Forever" [...] was also featured in several DVD sets featuring compilations of episodes, including the Star Trek: Fan Collective: Captain’s Log, as selected by Shatner, and Captain Kirk's Boldest Missions in 2015.|$|E

50|$|Though {{this would}} have made Motie starships {{incredibly}} formidable in combat, the <b>expanding</b> <b>Field</b> actually proved fatal to Motie ships that left their system. The endpoint of the original Alderson point in the Mote system opens within the photosphere of Murcheson's Eye, a red giant star. Survival in such a hostile environment requires a Langston Field, but in this case, an <b>expanding</b> <b>Field</b> is counterproductive. While inside a star, the Field has no opportunity to radiate heat, as it is constantly absorbing heat from all directions. A standard, static field will absorb heat at a fixed rate and will eventually overheat and explode if the ship does not leave the star regularly, but the absorption is slow enough to allow any ship with such a Field to survive for many hours before needing to exit the star to cool off. Unlike in normal space where extra surface area means extra radiated heat, inside a star increased surface area radically increases {{the rate at which}} heat is absorbed, causing a ship with an <b>expanding</b> <b>Field</b> to explode within minutes. Often this occurs before the Moties onboard recover from the side effects of traversing the Alderson tramline.|$|R
