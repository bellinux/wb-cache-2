40|$|Permafrost {{retention}} and thawing are {{important factors in}} engineering, construction, groundwater dynamics, and biodiversity in high latitude terrestrial environments. Accelerated thawing of permafrost near major highways has been well-documented in North America and Asia. Tree-ring data has been used extensively {{as a proxy for}} measuring historical streamflow and climate fluctuations and may prove useful as a proxy for constraining the timing and rate of highway-related permafrost thawing. Generally, during periods of higher effective moisture, trees produce wider rings. During periods of <b>drought</b> <b>ring</b> growth is suppressed, resulting in narrower rings. By combining the ring width measurements from multiple trees with precipitation data, it is possible to reconstruct temporal precipitation patterns and cycles. By extension, it should also be possible to reconstruct other vegetation-relevant signals, such as permafrost thawing, by using known historical precipitation and climate cycle data to filter the tree-ring signal. As permafrost is known to have an effect on groundwater availability, permafrost may exert direct control on tree growth rate. This study tests the hypothesis that tree growth rates increase significantly with proximity to major highways due to permafrost thawing. Further, we expect that trees growing along isolines at progressive distances from the highway (i. e., 5, 10, 15, 20 meters) will have higher correlations with each other than with trees growing closer to or farther from the highway, showing increased rates of growth with proximity to permafrost-melting roadways. Ninety-six black and white spruce trees (Picea mariana and Picea glauca) were cored at sites along the Glenn Highway, in interior Alaska, and chronologies built and correlated with COFECHA (standard tree-ring analysis software). While initial analysis shows that there may be the expected mean annual increase in highway-proximal tree growth, we have not yet applied climate data filters to our tree ring measurements...|$|E
40|$|It’s {{tempting to}} think of the current dry spell as an episode that we have to weather and get through, but in reality {{we have no way of}} knowing whether we’re {{approaching}} the end of a three-year drought or we’re in the early phases of a 10 – 20 -year <b>drought.</b> Tree <b>ring</b> and sediment studies reveal that we’re now in the driest period in 400 years, but before that droughts lasting 10, 20 and even 50 years plus, were not uncommon. Th e century starting in the late 1800 ’s was the wettest 100 -year period during the past 7, 000 years. Th is also happens to have been the time when the massive water infrastructure of the West was made; dams were built, reservoirs fi lled, pipes and aqueduct laid, and far more water was promised than now exists.

40|$|Drought {{stress from}} soil or air limits plant growth and development, {{leading to a}} {{reduction}} in crop productivity. Several E 3 ligases positively or negatively regulate the drought stress response. In the present study, we show that the pepper (Capsicum annuum) <b>Drought</b> Induced <b>RING</b> type E 3 ligase 1, CaDIR 1, regulates the drought stress response via abscisic acid (ABA) -mediated signaling. CaDIR 1 contains a C 3 HC 4 -type RING finger domain in the N-terminal region; this domain functions during protein degradation via attachment of ubiquitins to the substrate target proteins. The expression levels of the CaDIR 1 gene were suppressed and induced by ABA and drought treatments, respectively. We conducted loss-of-function and gain-of function genetic studies to examine the in vivo function of CaDIR 1 in response to ABA and drought stress. CaDIR 1 -silenced pepper plants displayed a drought-tolerant phenotype characterized by a low level of transpirational water loss via increased stomatal closure and elevated leaf temperatures. CaDIR 1 -overexpressing (OX) Arabidopsis plants exhibited an ABA-hypersensitive phenotype during the germination stage, but an ABA-hyposensitive phenotype—characterized by decreased stomatal closure and reduced leaf temperatures—at the adult stage. Moreover, adult CaDIR 1 -OX plants exhibited a drought-sensitive phenotype characterized by high levels of transpirational water loss. Our results indicate that CaDIR 1 functions as a negative regulator of the drought stress response via ABA-mediated signaling. Our findings provide a valuable insight into the plant defense mechanism that operates during drought stress...|$|R
40|$|Classical field {{methods of}} reconstructing <b>drought</b> using tree <b>rings</b> in humid, {{temperate}} regions typically target old trees from drought-prone sites. This approach limits investigators {{to a handful}} of species and excludes large amounts of data that might be useful, especially for coverage gaps in large-scale networks. By sampling in more “typical” forests, network density and species diversity would increase in ways that could potentially improve reconstructions. Ten nonclassical tree-ring chronologies derived from randomly selected trees, trees from logged forests, or both were compared to more classical chronologies and an independent regional drought reconstruction to determine their usefulness for dendrohydroclimatic research. We find that nonclassical chronologies are significantly correlated to classical chronologies and reconstructed drought over the last 2 – 3 centuries. While nonclassical chronologies have spectral properties similar to those from classical dendroclimatic collections, they do lack spectral power at lower frequencies that are present in the drought reconstruction. Importantly, our results show that tree growth is strongly dependent on moisture availability, even for small, randomly selected trees in cut forests. These results indicate that there could be more data available in areas with few current tree-ring collections for studying climate history and that drought {{plays an important role in}} humid forests...|$|R
40|$|Questions: (1) How do extreme climatic {{events and}} climate {{variability}} influence radial growth of conifers (silver fir, Norway spruce, Scots pine) ? (2) How do elevation and soil water capacity (SWC) modulate sensitivity to climate? Location: The sampled conifer stands are in France, in western lowland and mountain forests, at elevations from 400 to 1700 m, and an SWC from 50 to 190 mm. Methods: We established stand chronologies for total ring width, earlywood and latewood width for the 33 studied stands (985 trees in total). Responses to climate were analysed using pointer years and bootstrapped response functions. Principal component analysis {{was applied to}} pointer years and response function coefficients in order to elucidate the ecological structure of the studied stands. Results: Extreme winter frosts are responsible for greater growth reductions in silver fir than in Norway spruce, especially at the upper elevation, while Scots pine was the least sensitive species. Exceptional spring droughts caused a notable growth decrease, especially when local conditions were dry (altitude< 1000 m and SWC< 100 mm for silver fir, western lowlands for Scots pine). Earlywood of silver fir depended on previous September and November and current-year February temperature, after which current June and July water supply influenced latewood. Earlywood of Norway spruce was influenced by previous September temperature, after which current spring and summer <b>droughts</b> influenced both <b>ring</b> components. In Scots pine, earlywood and latewood depended on the current summer water balance. Local conditions mainly modulated latewood formation. Conclusions: If the climate becomes drier, low-elevation dry stands or trees growing in western lowlands may face problems, as their growth is highly dependent on soil moisture availability...|$|R
40|$|Agrophysiological Responses and Water Use Efficiency of Maize (Zea mays L. - cv. Synthetic-C) in Water Deficit Conditions. Senegal {{is known}} to have very tow {{rainfall}} with high probability of <b>drought</b> occurring du <b>ring</b> crop development. The study on the growth of maize under water deficit conditions aimed at characterising its agro-physiological responses and the evaluation of its water use efficiency (WUE). A water deficit was applied respectively during the vegetative phase (T 1), at flowering start (T 3) and both during the vegetative phase and at flowering start (T 2) with a period of rewatering between these two phases. For the control (TO) water was applied by irrigation to maintain optimal water conditions for growth. The amount of water to complete (in low rainfall conditions during the cycle) was determined by measuring "bac" evapotranspiration and using crop coefficient (Kc) for maize during the different phases. The results show that Synthetic-C variety was sensitive to water deficit during the flowering phase. Actually, the relative water content (RWC), leaf water potential and crop water stress index (CWSI) were less sensitive to water deficit during the flowering phase than during the vegetative phase. These parameters showed a higher rate of decrease during the vegetative phase. On the other hand, gazeous exchanges [stomatal conductance (Gs) and transpiration (Tr) ] were found to be more sensitive to water deficit during the reproductive stage. Moreover, significantly low grain yield and WUE were observed during this phase of development. However, on the basis of physiological parameters and productivity, Synthetic-C showed a good capacity to resume its physiological activities after rewatering during the vegetative phase, similar to a good plasticity of the control...|$|R
40|$|A hydrologic {{model is}} related to dendrochronological {{measurements}} performed in a 52 years old Spruce stand. The site is situated on a hillside with shallow and acid brown soil in the ecoregion of Ardenne (Wallonia, Southern Belgium). Hydrologic modelling The hydrologic simulation runs from 1971 to 2005 at daily time step. The model {{is based on an}} EPIC code, adapted to the site concerning soil reservoirs depth, characteristic water contents, root profile and water uptake. Weather data come from the Royal Meteorological Institute. Outputs from the model are real evapotranspiration, surface runoff; interflows, deep percolation and soil moisture at daily time step. Dendrochronological study Tree ring thickness is measured on 24 core samples extracted from 12 dominant trees of the stand. Annual increments are standardised by the ARIMA function in order to produce the annual deviation of ring thickness. Means of annual deviation for the 12 trees are then related to annual soil drought intensities. Results Years 1976 and 1996 are emphasised by both the modelling outputs and the dendrochronological measurements as very dry. Model shows a severe <b>drought</b> and tree <b>ring</b> shows a very low growth. Years like 1990, 1992, 1994 and 2004 shows a less severe drought event but a drought that occurs in June-July, which seems to penalize spruce’s growth. On the other hand, years 1981 and 1998 show an important growth and a high value of mean soil moisture during June and July. The poster will show how the time evolution of the ARIMA index {{is related to}} some meaningful hydrologic indexes. These considerations will allow us to progress towards forecasting forest trees reaction to climate events and change. With this in mind, we will use a climate scenario build up in the frame of the AMICE interreg project. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Herb- or shrub-chronology, a {{technique}} adapted from dendrochronology, {{is the study}} of the annual growth rings in roots of certain perennial dicotyledonous plants. The presence of annual growth increments in high-elevation plants is significant as it highlights the applicability of herbchronology for climatic, ecological and geomorphologic applications in alpine and other extra-arboreal regions. For alpine sites along the eastern crest of the Sierra Nevada range I present the first shrub-ring chronologies of the species Linanthus pungens (Torr.) J. M. Porter & L. A. Johnson. L. pungens individuals were collected at, and are especially ubiquitous at rock glacier sites in north-east trending glacial-cirque valleys. Rock glaciers are an increasingly recognized and studied feature on the alpine landscape, supporting floristically diverse plant populations, distinct thermal regimes decoupled from the external air and perennial water sources fed by interstitial ice. These landforms are expected to be refugia for alpine flora and fauna in some regions for projected warmer and drier climates. To evaluate plant growth on rock glaciers as compared to adjacent talus slopes in the central Sierra Nevada range of California, USA, a series of five cirque basins were selected as sites for paired rock glacier- talus slope vegetation comparisons. Vegetation cover, species richness, diversity measures and plant functional traits were recorded at ten sites (five rock glaciers, five talus slopes) along a 100 -kilometer latitudinal span of the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada range. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to evaluate general patterns in cover, diversity and functional traits for the 10 sites and inform subsequent statistical analyses. Both vegetation cover and species richness were significantly greater on rock glacier sites than on adjacent talus slopes even though mean slope values for the rock glacier sites were higher. Significantly, for the present study, rock glaciers support a higher number of the species Linanthus pungens, a climatically sensitive, long-lived alpine sub-shrub, showing that these periglacial landforms are not only floristically distinct but are also habitats containing natural climate archives useful to the field of herbchronology. L. pungens shrub-ring chronologies are determined to be distinct from Pinus albicaulis chronologies growing at the same five sets of sites in the Sierra Nevada study location. P. albicaulis (PIAL) tree-ring chronologies and L. pungens (LIPU) shrub-ring chronologies were constructed for four cirque basin sites. Comparisons were made between chronologies based on growth form (shrub or tree) and site, and on chronology response to average monthly temperature, total monthly precipitation and April 1 snowpack values. Chronologies are significantly more similar to other chronologies of the same growth form (PIAL-PIAL or LIPU-LIPU) than are same-site chronologies of different growth form (i. e. PIAL-LIPU chronologies) (p 0. 85) to capture a robust common signal from 1952 through 2007). Marker years in the BL chronology correspond to <b>drought</b> (wide <b>rings)</b> and persistent snowpack (narrow rings). Response function analysis indicates significant correlations with July minimum temperatures and the previous year's November precipitation. Increase in the radial growth of the taproot of L. pungens at BL has not decreased over the past century and is more highly correlated to temperature (positively) and snowpack and precipitation (negatively) during {{the latter half of the}} chronology period. Predictions of decreasing snowpack and warming temperatures for the alpine Sierra Nevada could indicate increased shrub growth over the next century and possible shrub range expansion if unprecedented drought does not prove to limit growth in the future. Work at BL and the other four alpine L. pungens chronology locations demonstrate a potential for additional research on climate-shrub growth interactions and in particular for investigations into climate controls on upper shrubline growth and movement in the Sierra Nevada range in California...|$|R
