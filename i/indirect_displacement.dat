The present research investigated property-led redevelopment in Shenzhen and the induced chain effects of price-shadowing and indirect residential displacement. It was found that property-led urban redevelopment exhibits strong effects of price-shadowing on adjacent housing prices by creating property hot spots and bringing about changes in the housing market. A multilevel hedonic model quantitatively confirmed the price-shadowing effect of urban redevelopment, by showing that perceived or actual redevelopment increases housing prices in the vicinity.

40|$|While {{displacement}} {{is valuable}} {{information for the}} structural behavior, measuring displacements from large civil structures is often challenging and costly. To overcome difficulties found in direct measurements such as using linear variable differential transformer and LASER-based methods, <b>indirect</b> <b>displacement</b> estimation approaches are alternatively developed. Such indirect approaches in general rely on acceleration or strain that is relatively cost effective and convenient to measure. However, these measurements have own characteristics that limit wider application of the indirect estimation. For example, as the double integration of acceleration results in the low-frequency drift in the estimated displacement, high-pass filters are often used to suppress the drift, assuming displacements are close to a zero mean process; strain is difficult to use for high-frequency modes. These types of limitations can be resolved by the fusion {{of different types of}} measurements. This study develops an <b>indirect</b> <b>displacement</b> estimation method based on the multimetric data (i. e., acceleration and strain) that can estimate nonzero mean, dynamic displacements. The proposed approach is numerically validated, showing better estimation than the single measurement-based methods. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed approach is verified using dynamic response data measured from the Sorok Bridge, a cable-stayed bridge in Korea. close 1...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: G-protein coupled {{receptor}}s (GPCRs) are a {{class of}} drug targets of primary importance. However, receptor assays are based on measurement of either ligand displacement or downstream functional responses, rather than direct observation of ligand binding. Issues of allosteric modulation, probe dependence, and functional selectivity create challenges in selecting suitable assays formats. Therefore, a method that directly measures GPCR ligand interactions, independent of binding site, probe, and signaling pathway would be a useful primary and orthogonal screening method. We have developed a GPCR biosensor assay protocol that offers the opportunity for high-throughput label-free screening that directly measures GPCR ligand interactions. The biosensor-based direct screening method identifies the interaction of both orthosteric and allosteric ligands with solubilized, native GPCRs, in a label-free and cell-free environment, thus overcoming the limitations of <b>indirect</b> and <b>displacement</b> assay methods. We exemplify the method by the discovery of novel ligands for the chemokine receptor, CCR 5, that are ligand efficient fragments...|$|R

40|$|The C-terminal {{region of}} tubulin is {{involved}} in multiple aspects of the regulation of microtubule assembly. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of this regulation, we study here, using different approaches, the interaction of Tau, spermine, and calcium, three representative partners of the tubulin C-terminal region, with a peptide composed of the last 42 residues of α 1 a-tubulin. The results show that their binding involves overlapping amino acid stretches in the C-terminal tubulin region: amino acid residues 421 – 441 for Tau, 430 – 432 and 444 – 451 for spermine, and 421 – 443 for calcium. Isothermal titration calorimetry, NMR, and cosedimentation experiments show that Tau and spermine have similar micromolar binding affinities, whereas their binding stoichiometry differs (C-terminal tubulin peptide/spermine stoichiometry 1 : 2, and C-terminal tubulin peptide/Tau stoichiometry 8 : 1). Interestingly, calcium, known as a negative regulator of microtubule assembly, can compete with the binding of Tau and spermine with the C-terminal domain of tubulin and with {{the positive effect of}} these two partners on microtubule assembly in vitro. This observation opens up the possibility that calcium may participate in the regulation of microtubule assembly in vivo through direct (still unknown) or <b>indirect</b> mechanism (<b>displacement</b> of microtubule partners).

40|$|In {{therapeutic}} {{monitoring of}} antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) {{the level of}} unbound drug at the sampling site should ideally equal the unbound concentration at receptor sites. Microdialysis enables direct sampling of the unbound drug concentration and avoids some of the difficulties encountered with ex vivo protein binding. Following cathether application, the patient can be continuously monitored during several days, avoiding the trauma associated with repeated venepuncture. The general aim of this thesis was to evaluate the potential of subcutaneous microdialysis {{as a tool for}} therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of AEDs by studies of AED pharmacokinetics in plasma, subcutaneous extracellular fluid (ECF) and subdural cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The reliability and safety of subcutaneous microdialysis sampling of valproate (VPA), carbamazepine (CBZ), phenobarbital (PB) and phenytoin (PHT) was investigated in vitro and in vivo. In vitro studies showed no binding of VPA to the equipment. The binding of CBZ and PB was limited and predictable while the binding of PHT was extensive and highly variable, which precluded in vivo testing. In vivo subcutaneous microdialysis studies showed a close to 100 % recovery for VPA. The CBZ recovery, when corrected for binding to the plastic tubing, was 81 %. In single case studies, subdural CSF and subcutaneous ECF levels of CBZ and PB were similar and when corrected for binding to the plastic tubings they were also close to protein unbound concentrations in plasma. The time course of the distribution of VPA to subdural CSF in relation to subcutaneous ECF and plasma after a single oral dose in three patients undergoing subdural EEG monitoring because of drug resistent epilepsy was studied. VPA was rapidly distributed to subdural CSF in concentrations marginally lower than subcutaneous microdialysate and unbound plasma concentrations. The relation between VPA induced tremor and VPA concentrations measured as unbound and total concentrations in plasma and in subcutaneous microdialysate was investigated in a dose matched casecontrol study. VPA levels did not differ significantly between tremor cases and controls, irrespective of which sampling method that was used. The degree of tremor was weakly correlated with VPA concentrations and none of the concentration measures used was superior to the other in terms of correlation to tremor. When comparing unbound and total plasma VPA and subcutaneous microdialysate VPA after a single dose and in steady state, the unbound plasma fraction was significantly higher (p< 0. 001) in the steady state group compared to the single dose group. The unbound VPA fraction was also significantly higher in steady state compared to spiked samples both at low and high total VPA concentrations (p< 0. 001). The results provide <b>indirect</b> evidence of <b>displacement</b> of VPA from plasma proteins by product(s) of VPA biotransformation. Microdialysis was used to estimate topiramate (TPM) concentrations in subdural CSF and subcutaneous ECF in relation to plasma levels in a single case study of a patient undergoing subdural EEG monitoring because of drug resistent epilepsy. The subcutaneous ECF and subdural CSF TPM concentrations were similar and corresponded well (r= 0. 98). Total TPM concentrations in plasma were 75 and 80 % of subcutaneous and subdural levels respectively and, assuming a TPM protein binding of - 13 % they were close to unbound TPM levels in plasma. It is concluded that subcutaneous microdialysis {{has the potential to be}} useful for TDM of VPA, CBZ, PB and TPM and may be of benefit in situations when frequent long term monitoring of unbound drug concentrations and a minimal trauma is particularly desirable...|$|R
40|$|Recently, an <b>indirect</b> <b>displacement</b> {{estimation}} method using data fusion of acceleration and strain (i. e., acceleration-strain-based method) has been developed. Though the method showed good performance on beam-like structures, it has inherent limitation in applying to more general types of bridges {{that may have}} complex shapes, because it uses assumed analytical (sinusoidal) mode shapes to map the measured strain into displacement. This paper proposes an improved displacement {{estimation method}} {{that can be applied}} to more general types of bridges by building the mapping using the finite element model of the structure rather than using the assumed sinusoidal mode shapes. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by numerical simulations on a deck arch bridge model and a three-span truss bridge model whose mode shapes are difficult to express as analytical functions. The displacements are estimated by acceleration-based method, strain-based method, acceleration-strain-based method, and the improved method. Then the results are compared with the exact displacement. An experimental validation is also carried out on a prestressed concrete girder bridge. The proposed method is found to provide the best estimate for dynamic displacements in the comparison, showing good agreement with the measurements as well.

40|$|Accurate {{displacement}} sensing or estimation is {{an important}} task for reliably assessing the condition of civil infrastructure such as bridges and buildings, because the structural displacement describes {{the behavior of a}} structure and indicates structural safety according to the design limit. However, it is difficult to directly measure the displacement of a bridge structure due to the inaccessibility of a reference point especially when bridges are built over a highway, a river or the sea. As an alternative, an <b>indirect</b> <b>displacement</b> estimation using two different types of measurements such as strain and acceleration (i. e., multimetric data) has been developed.

Mid-size cities are experiencing gentrification as they look to revitalize the urban realm and there is concern of <b>indirect</b> <b>displacement</b> pressures through this process on existing lower-income residents. This research is a case study of the South Wedge neighborhood in Rochester, New York. The research explores the nature of gentrification in mid-size cities and the experiences of residents through the transformation, looking for policy implications as other cities and neighborhoods navigate this process. The following is a mixed-methods approach of thirteen resident interviews along with data analysis of the census, housing sale prices, crime and assessment data and businesses over approximately ten to fifteen-year timeframe. Resident interviews were gathered through a snowball sampling method and every effort was made to achieve a spectrum of demographics. Unfortunately, due to limiting factors during the research phase, the low-income population is missing from this study. The South Wedge neighborhood has experienced a high demand for residential housing, a spike in residential sale prices over a two-year period, and demographic shifts in income class, racial make-up, and total population indicating gentrification.

40|$|Chinese cities {{nowadays}} face profound {{restructuring and}} transformations, {{manifested in the}} urban built environment by booming redevelopment projects. Property-led urban redevelopment might cause large-scale displacement of low-income residents, generating unintended place- and people-based consequences. Despite the magnitude of these displacement processes, {{there is a general}} lack of insight into the patterns, dynamics, and mechanisms of this urban phenomenon in China. The main aim of this research is therefore to identify the mechanisms and selective socio-economic consequences of redevelopment-induced displacement. A particular interest lies in the redevelopment of urban villages, a type of informal settlements in urban China that mainly accommodates low-income rural migrants. Through in-depth empirical studies in Shenzhen, this research finds that varied forms of displacement have manifested themselves as a result of urban redevelopment. First, demolition of old residential buildings directly displaces large populations of low-income residents, leading to serious impacts on these social groups. Second, urban redevelopment poses spill-over effects on the housing prices in adjacent urban areas, with <b>indirect</b> <b>displacement</b> as a main consequence. By mapping the location of relocation after displacement, we find that displaced migrants tend to attach to their original neighbourhoods and move only short distances, since imperative economic, spatial, and social resources are all affiliated to the original neighbourhoods. This research also unravels considerable heterogeneity that exists in the displaced population in Chinese cities, which can result in diverse behaviors and associated consequences of redevelopment. Based on this finding, this research calls for further theoretical delineation of the heterogeneity of the displaced population, in which socio-economic and institutional characteristics that are individually embedded need to be considered so as to develop a more robust and nuanced theory of residential displacement. In addition, this research develops a theoretical view on displacement as a redistributive process of urban resources. Specifically, it shows that residential displacement tends to redistribute the real income of those displaced, defined as access to urban resources in economic (market exchange), social (reciprocity), and institutional (redistribution) spheres. Through this critical theoretical lens, the inherent redistributive nature of the displacement process is more evidently and fully revealed, which can also be applied in other contexts. Situating within the Chinese context, this research outlines two policy implications. On the one hand, the absorptive capacity of the urban system for displaced migrants needs to be improved. Granting displaced low-income migrants access to public low-rent housing is a possible solution. In the long run, migrants’ tenancy rights need to be recognized, {{so that they can be}} considered for compensation for their relocation. On the other hand, this research calls for the integration of people-based elements into currently predominant place-centred policies. These elements address economic, spatial and social dimensions of inclusion, of which the recognition and empowerment of migrants are of great importance. Overall, this research calls for an integrated planning strategy, in which place-based initiatives need to be complemented by locally responsive people-based approaches...|$|E

There has been contentious debate over the definition of gentrification, but but through its evolution and adaptation to new contexts it has remained a popular topic among scholars in urban planning. Among the studies and papers published, there are many that show that the process is not only driven by individual actors', but it is also a process deeply affected by government interests and objectives and therefore by public investments. The consequences of the process are still debated; some hail the process as a boost for everyone, (e. g. Duany, 2001), while others assert that gentrification limits accessibility to urban space for lower-income, working-class households, often with already reduced options in terms of housing, and ultimately contributes to creating increasingly socially polarized urban spaces (Marcuse, 1986; Newman and Wyly, 2006). Keeping a necessarily critical perspective in mind, this study identifies the onset of gentrification in Canadian cities and links this process to an element of urban infrastructure essential to cities; transit. The objective of this research is not only to see what the effects of the implementation of transit are on gentrification when it is initially implemented, but also to look at the impacts of transit over time on the gentrification of surrounding neighbourhoods. In the gentrification literature there are a number of articles that make mention of the influential role of accessibility, and transit, on the process of gentrification. The relationship between neighbourhood changes and the implementation and upgrading of transit infrastructure, has, as of yet, not been clearly established. Though transit has long been recognized as having important connections to changes in land-use in the areas surrounding it, there have been few studies that attempt to explore, explicitly, the connections between the implementation of rail transit infrastructure and the process of gentrification in the surrounding metropolitan area. Additionally the few studies that do exist that explicitly address the relationship between transit and gentrification do not adhere to the conventional definition of gentrification according to the literature. The hypothesis of this project is that the implementation of rapid rail transit contributes to the gentrification of surrounding neighbourhoods and may result in the displacement of lower-income households, who would have the greatest marginal benefit from access to transit. This study presents data and analysis in order to assess the hypothesis using a number of indicators of gentrification and covering a study period long enough to capture the effects of major urban rapid rail transit as it has been implemented and upgraded in Canadian cities in the 20 th century. This study will specifically address the effects of rail transit infrastructure on gentrification in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver. ...|$|E
40|$|Human {{activities}} are increasingly altering {{the ways in}} which energy and elements cycle within and move between ecosystems. Through fossil fuel combustion and the use of synthetic fertilizers we continue to expose much of the biosphere to new rates and ratios of essential element supply. We are also shifting climate patterns on local, regional and global scales in ways that affect reaction rates and residence times of elements within ecosystems. Even the simplest ecosystems are usually too complex to predict many of the potential consequences that human activities will have on their sustained functioning. Because of this, we often monitor ecosystems as integrated wholes, looking to explain processes that account for important patterns observed across space and time. This dissertation consists of 3 data chapters, all of which use the small watershed ecosystem as the principal unit of study for understanding how human activities have altered element cycling in temperate forests in the southern Appalachian Mountains. In Chapter 2, we present results from repeated synoptic surveys of streamwater chemistry for ~ 30 watersheds spanning one of the largest nitrogen (N) deposition gradients in North America, located within the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. We primarily focus on patterns in dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentrations and composition across the N gradient, with particular attention given to dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). DON dominates the global flux of N between terrestrial and aquatic systems, yet we have little understanding of how this prevailing N form responds to human N pollution. We found that DON concentrations often declined significantly with increasing catchment N loading and, through laboratory bioavailability assays, found that when N limitation is alleviated increased microbial demand for labile carbon (C) may drive this pattern. We use these findings to suggest a new hypothesis for the potential responses of DON to anthropogenic N pollution that accounts for the dual role that DON plays in both C and N cycles. Chapter 3 is an extension of Chapter 2, in which we attempt to assess the role of DON as either a C or N source within an entire stream reach through a series of independent manipulations of labile C and inorganic N availabilities. In the second order reach of Walker Branch, a well-studied stream in eastern Tennessee, we performed a series of progressive (i. e., sequentially increasing concentrations), kinetic (i. e., very short duration), enrichments of acetate and nitrate on two successive days during April of 2009 before the tree canopy emerged and when in-stream algal production was high. In this system and on these short timescales, we were unable to elicit the same responses observed at sites across the chronic N deposition gradient in Chapter 2. We did, however, observe that DOM processing and composition was significantly altered. Using fluorescence characterization of DOM, we found that adding acetate displaced heterotrophic demand for terrestrially derived DOM. Conversely, nitrate additions stimulated production of highly bioavailable autochthonous DOM within the stream channel, which resulted in an <b>indirect</b> <b>displacement</b> of demand for terrestrially derived DOM. Understanding DOM dynamics in streams has long been a priority for stream ecologists because it represents an important energy and nutrient source fueling stream metabolism. Our results provide new insight into the processes controlling DOM concentrations and composition in Walker Branch, as well as demonstrate the potential of this method for future investigations of DOM in stream ecosystems. Chapter 4 deviates from the preceding chapters' focus on N availability and ecosystem DOM dynamics, instead assessing the role of climate change on long-term streamwater concentrations and fluxes from the West Fork of the Walker Branch watershed. At this site, mean annual temperatures have increased by ~ 2 &# 730;C, while mean annual precipitation and runoff have declined by ~ 20 % and > 40 %, respectively, since 1989. We use weekly streamwater samples to assess trends in concentrations and fluxes for 9 different solutes over this period and, using wet deposition data, also evaluate changes in approximate watershed input-output budgets. The observed change in runoff was accompanied by a change in the proportional contributions of different soil flowpaths to streamflow generation through time, with deep groundwater playing an increasingly important role in recent years. Solutes that increase in concentration deeper in the soil profile exhibited significant increases in streamwater concentrations through time, while solutes with higher concentrations in soil solution in the upper profile decreased in concentration. Nutrient solutes, which exhibit much less variation across soil flowpaths, typically display large seasonal patterns in streamwater concentrations that are driven by in-stream biological uptake. However, most nutrient solutes exhibited little or no trend in concentrations through time, indicating that the biological controls on these solutes have remained relatively unaltered by the observed changes in climate over the 20 -year period. On shorter timescales, changes in the frequency or severity of multi-year droughts, as well as changes in the frequency or intensity of storms that disrupt in-stream uptake, can have large impacts on watershed input-output budgets of nutrient solutes even if the effects do not manifest as linear trends through time. Our results demonstrate the important role that changing climates can have on watershed element cycles, illustrating that climate effects can manifest through either changes in hydrologic regime or through changing biogeochemical process rates. Taken together, these chapters illustrate that human {{activities are}} indirectly but substantially changing biogeochemical cycles in temperate forests throughout the Southern Appalachians. Ecosystem structure and function depends on {{the ways in which}} energy and elements move within and between ecosystems. We rely on the sustained integrity of ecosystems for their many services and, because of this, it is essential that we understand ecosystem responses to current and future human impacts.
