30|$|Baiyun Depression {{experienced}} three evolving formation stages, {{which are}} rift stage, thermal subsidence stage and neotectonic {{stage in the}} Cenozoic (Gong and Li [1997]; Zhu et al. [2007]), and formed “three uplifts and two depressions”, featuring great terrain fluctuations and sharp gradients. Baiyun Depression was preliminarily formed at the rift stage. At the thermal subsidence stage, major block of Baiyun Depression sank fast and greatly; the ancient Zhujiang Delta moved to deposit in the depression, providing plenty of sediment sources (MiL and Shen [2008]). At the neotectonic stage, structural sedimentation velocity and scale, as well as depositing rate and scale are in succeeded development; and many late faults were developed at Baiyun Depression and its surrounding area due to NWW subduction of Philippine plate, having created structural conditions for development of submarine landslides (Sun et al. [2005]). Through study on pressure evolution of Baiyun Depression strata, {{it is found that}} the stratum pressure of Baiyun Depression is normal at the shallow-water area, and weak in the deepwater area; however, wide range of <b>diapir</b> <b>structure</b> in the Depression suggests that the area might have experienced three times of overpressure accumulations and release in the late period (Shi et al. [2006]), creating pressure condition for development of submarine landslides.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Pierce Field in the Central UK North Sea is a twin <b>diapir</b> <b>structure</b> that {{produces}} from the Paleocene Forties Sandstone Member (Forties Sandstone). Different hydrocarbon– water contacts {{encountered in the}} wells around both diapirs have been variously ascribed to a hydrodynamically tilted oil–water contact or else some form of stepped (compartmentalized) contact. Recent reinterpretation of the structure, sedimentology and fluid geochemistry has indicated that the stratigraphic architecture of the reservoir is the prime control on fluid flow over both geological and production time-scales. These depositional architectures deflect the hydrodynamic flow of aquifer water around the field, resulting in a modified-tilted-contact. The same depositional architectures control the flow of fluids under production. The Forties Sandstone was emplaced by turbidity flows influenced by pre-existing seafloor topography that funneled the flows into discrete sediment corridors and into the Pierce area. The rising twin diapirs further influenced the flows by forming: (a) a small salt withdrawal basin between the diapirs that captured sediment; and (b) enough seafloor topography to prevent {{the bulk of the}} flows from depositing significant amounts of sand over the crest of the diapirs. Because the bulk of the high permeability sands were deposited in a rim around the diapirs, the aquifer and injecte...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Yinggehai Basin is a Cenozoic {{high-temperature}} and high-pressure basin where diapir {{and thermal}} fluid activities were {{so strong that}} the deeply-sourced natural gas accumulated in the shallow traps in the <b>diapir</b> <b>structures.</b> A total of 11 exploratory wells were drilled in 8 <b>diapir</b> <b>structures</b> before 2010, but no commercial gas discoveries were made, provoking a hot debate {{on the possibility of}} discovering medium-to-large quality gas reservoirs in the middle and deep layers of the diaper structures. A comprehensive analysis of hydrocarbon generation kinetics, reservoir distribution and sealing conditions revealed the following findings. (1) Three gas-charging mechanisms were identified in the study area, namely slow free gas charging and accumulation under buoyancy, slow charging, evolving and accumulation of water soluble gas, and mixed-phase episodic accumulation. (2) In the high-temperature and high-pressure zones in the core of the diapir, the early gas reservoirs experienced multi-stage transformation at later periods, thus the possibility of forming large gas reservoirs dominated by hydrocarbon is small. In the flanks of the diapir, the early gas reservoirs may be well preserved at later stages, thus it is possible to discover primary gas pools. In the non-diapir zones, water soluble gas reservoirs may occur. (3) Three gas accumulation modes may exist in the study area, namely “the mixed-phase transformation mode” of semi-closed overpressure system in the core and periphery of a diapir, “the gas-phase seepage mode” in the flanks of a diapir, and “the water-phase desolvation mode” of a closed over-pressured system in the non-diapir zones. The analysis revealed that the failure of the previous exploratory drilling was caused mainly by emplacing the wells in the core of the <b>diapir</b> <b>structures.</b> The geochemical behaviors further support that the flanks of a diapir is the favorable place for high-temperature and high-pressure gas accumulation. Exploration practices based on these understandings finally led to the discovery of the large Dongfang 13 - 1 / 13 - 2 gas fields...|$|R

The porosity consists of 68 % intergranular porosity of {{primary and secondary}} origin, 17 % secondary intragranular nd moldic porosity, and 15 % rnicroporosity. A microcrystalline quartz druse, which was derived from alteration of lithic fragments, coats framework grains and retards the development of syntaxial quartz overgrowths. Other cements are patchy ankerite (0. 3 - 13. 7 vol%) and kaolinite, which also occurs as a replacement of framework grains. The total kaolinite content ranges from 1. 8 to 8. 2 vol%. Kaolinite and remnants of altered and partially dissolved lithic fragments are susceptible to movement with fluid flow. Formation sensitivity ests howed that the kaolinite-rich sandstone was stable to 2 % NaCI water, but introduction of freshwater caused permeability mpairment. Acid treatment to remove damage produced sporadic results. Injection of HCI raised the permeability temporarily, indicating that fines were still being liberated within the pore network.

40|$|International audienceThe {{structure}} of the southern Atlas fold-and-thrust belt of Tunisia was investigated using new geologic mapping, seismic reflection data together {{with the construction of}} a balanced cross section. The structural architecture of the Tunisian foreland consists in a mixed tectonic style with deep-seated basement faults, shallower decollements within sedimentary cover and salt diapirism. The restoration of the cross section shows a surface shortening of 8. 1 km (similar to 7. 3 %). Sequential restoration of the balanced cross section has been permitted to decipher the structure and evolution of the southern Tethyan margin of Tunisia. Structural geometry and orientation of the pre-existing Permian (?) to Cretaceous extensional structures controlled subsequent contractional deformation within the sedimentary cover. During the shortening, this inherited tectonic framework controlled the development of ENE-trending thrust-related anticlines such as the Orbata and Chemsi structures, NW-trending lateral ramp such as the Gafsa and Fejej faults and <b>diapir</b> <b>structures</b> as the Beidha anticline. The inversion of the margin can be correlated with the onset of the convergence between Africa and Eurasia. The first phase of the Orbata thrusting growth might occur in late Cretaceous. Continuous inversion of the margin occurred during the Eocene and mainly during the late Miocene to present day. This study underlines the predominant role of inherited basement structures acquired during the evolution of the southern Tethyan margin, and their influence on the geometry of the Atlassic thrust belt. This structural analysis provides new perspectives for future hydrocarbon exploration in this poorly explored region. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

In total 13 NW-SE striking pro&# 64257;les running parallel to the continental slope were recorded at water depths between 1000 and 2500 m covering an area of approximately 700 square km. This study presents some new results from the ongoing investigations with these seismic pro&# 64257;les. The continental margin off Nicaragua is dominated by deeply incised canyons and numerous mound structures, as well as two large slides at the lower slope. Most of these mud mounds built positive topographic expressions (up to ca. 130 m) on the sea&# 64258;oor. They are characterized by transparent or semitransparent seismic facies in the cylinder like feeder channel tapering upward to cone shape geometry. The mud mounds are of different size and at different stages of development. The distribution of the mounds shows two distinct orientations (NW-SE and NE-SW) and is controlled by faults.

40|$|Knowledge of {{subsurface}} pressures {{within the}} Palaeogene strata of the Central North Sea {{is an important}} aspect of the petroleum geology of the basin, enabling a better understanding of migration pathways, the potential for hydrodynamic trapping with tilted fluid contacts, and better assurance that drilling is carried out both safely and efficiently. In this thesis, Palaeogene pressure data collected from over 300 offshore wells in the UK, Norwegian and Danish sectors of the North Sea are analysed. Regional overpressure distributions within individual Palaeocene and Eocene sandstone members are mapped across the Central North Sea, and lateral fluid flow pathways are interpreted within each individual sandstone member. Drainage within the older Maureen, Mey and Forties sandstone members is found to be predominantly south-east to north-west, with additional westwards drainage observed within the Mey and Forties sands, where smaller lateral fans fed into the basin from the Western Platform. Overpressure distributions within the Cromarty and Tay sandstone members indicate drainage westwards, where fluids probably escape through shelfal sandstones of the Mousa and Dornoch formations. Locations of vertical drainage pathways between sandstone members were interpreted using local anomalies in the overpressure distributions and shared hydrocarbon accumulations, with vertical fluid flow found to be facilitated most commonly via areas of direct contact between sands, salt <b>diapir</b> <b>structures,</b> remobilised sands, and non-sealing graben-bounding faults. Areas with the greatest potential of hydrodynamic trapping were identified, although more accurate assessment of the prospectivity of such areas is required on a local scale. Attempts at establishing the source of fluids entering into the Palaeogene system were made using 1 D and 3 D basin modelling. The results indicate a larger influx of fluid derived from the underlying pre-Cretaceous strata than from the overlying Tertiary mudrocks. These results, however, provide little quantification, and there is considerable scope for further work on 3 D basin modelling. ...|$|R

The construction of the model is comprised of three primary steps, namely: (1) the construction of surfaces for the various variables based on available 3 D data (seafloor temperature, geothermal gradient and depth-pressure); (2) the calculation of the gas function equilibrium functions for the various hydrocarbon compositions reported from hydrate and sediment samples; and (3) the calculation of {{the thickness of the}} hydrate stability zone.

40|$|Abstract: Mantle melting and the {{production}} of magmas along the NE Japan arc may be controlled by hot regions in the mantle wedge (hot fingers) that move toward the volcanic front along upward-sloping trajectories. At depths equivalent to 1 - 2 GPa, where magmas are expected to segregate from mantle <b>diapirs,</b> the hot-finger <b>structures</b> result in a decreas-ing thermal gradient away from volcanic front. Low-alkali tholeiite is therefore formed by the greater degree of diapiric melting near the volcanic front; high-alumina basalt and alkali olivine basalt are produced by lesser degrees of diapiric melting to the west. The grouping of volcanoes at the volcanic front is interpreted as being controlled by thermal structure in the mantle wedge, and groups are concentrated above the tips of the hot fingers. Map-view variations of minimum S 7 Sr/S 6 Sr of NE Japan volcanoes are interpreted as resulting from transport of fertile and high-S 7 Sr/S 6 Sr mantle material into he magma source region in the hot fingers. Given that mantle diapirs are formed in {{the lower part of the}} mantle wedge, a greater proportion of fertile material will be contained in the diapirs at the tips of the hot fingers, resulting in higher 87 Sr/S 6 Sr magmas along the volcanic front.

These sections were logged from boreholes and outcrops in Upper Pliocene-Lower Pleistocene deposits of the Teruel-Concud Residual Basin, close to de Concud normal fault. Timing of the succession and hence of seismic and non-seismic SSDSs, covering a time span between ~. 3. 6 and ~. 1. 9. Ma, has been constrained from previous biostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic information, then substantially refined {{from a new}} magnetostratigraphic study at Masada Cociero profile. Non-seismic SSDSs are relatively well-correlated between sections, while seismic ones are poorly correlated except for several clusters of structures. Between 29 and 35 seismic deformed levels have been computed for the overall stratigraphic succession. Factors controlling the lateral and vertical distribution of SSDSs are their seismic or non-seismic origin, {{the distance to the}} seismogenic source (Concud Fault), the sedimentary facies involved in deformation and the observation conditions (borehole core vs. natural outcrop). In the overall stratigraphic section, seismites show an apparent recurrence period of 56 to 108. ka. Clustering of seismic SSDSs levels within a 91 -ka-long interval records a period of high paleoseismic activity with an apparent recurrence time of 4. 8 to 6. 1. ka, associated with increasing sedimentation rate and fault activity. Such activity pattern of the Concud Fault for the Late Pliocene-Early Pliocene, with alternating periods of faster and slower slip, is similar to that for the most recent Quaternary (last ca. 74. ka BP). Concerning the research methods, time occurrence patterns recognized for peaks of paleoseismic activity from SSDSs in boreholes are similar to those inferred from primary evidence in trenches. Consequently, apparent recurrence periods calculated from SSDS inventories collected in borehole logs close to seismogenic faults are comparable to actual recurrence times of large paleoearthquakes...|$|R
40|$|The infill {{history of}} a salt {{withdrawal}} mini-basin in the contractional domain of the gravity-driven salt system on the Angolan passive margin has been reconstructed using a high resolution three-dimensional seismic data-set. Well-constrained biostratigraphy has allowed calculation of {{the growth rate of}} the basin-bounding structures. Within the interval of stratigraphy investigated, the depositional style of sediments preserved in the basin has changed in response to changes in the rate of growth of the coeval, adjacent salt structures. During {{the early part of the}} basin history, sedimentation in the slope system was dominated by a series of erosional channel complex systems, which are 1 - 3 km wide and contain a preserved infill 100 - 200 m thick. The creation of sea floor topography by contemporaneous salt movement and the development of salt-cored anticlines caused the channels to be deflected, diverted, off-set, or incised deeply as they interacted with the developing slope topography. Subsequent salt movement, and a concomitant increase in the growth rate of the basin-bounding anticlines, led to more elevated topography and the development of extensive slumping of sediment into the basin centers, forming large mass transport deposits. As salt movement continued, the basin became largely enclosed; bound by a well-developed salt wall to the west and a series of complex salt structures to the east, where salt-cored anticlines developed laterally into salt <b>diapirs.</b> These complex <b>structures</b> controlled the flow pathways of sediment both into and out of the basin. The growth rate of the structures constraining the western margin of the basin slowed at this time, and as a result, sediment transported from the east by feeder channels formed ponded fan systems comprised of sheets of sand each formed by multiple small channels. Understanding the impact that active growth structures can have on sediment distribution and facies development is invaluable in the exploration and production of oil and gas. In this area, the association of the channels with the structure has formed reservoir-trap combinations for four major oil fields, Plutao, Saturno, Marte and Venus, being combined together as the PSVM development. In each field, the specific interaction of the channels with the growing topography has controlled the channel architecture and facies development; this has meant that different development plans, risks and uncertainties are required for each field...|$|R
3000|$|The {{sector that}} {{developed}} from Zavrohon diapir up to Qafa Kicoku, has anticlinal structures with enormous dimensions, {{and it is}} represented by carbonate deposits (J 3 -Pg 2) which has in the core oldest deposists (the evaporites in the western flank of the Bureto anticline, Fig.  14), that are overthrust westward (Figs.  16, 17, etc.), rarely with a backthrust in the eastern flank (Nemercka and the Mitsikeli anticlines). The features of the backthrust on the eastern flank of the structures are very developed in the Greek territory, because of the diapir effect (Figs.  12, 15). This phenomenon is generally developed in the later phases of the collision stage (Cr 2 -N 1 2 s [...]), due to the evaporite diapir tectonics and the reactive westward thrust process. In this sector (Fig.  14), two anticlinal structural lines developed: the Trebeshina and Nemercka anticlines {{in the east and}} the Goliko, Lunxheri and Bureto anticlines in the west. They are divided from one another by a narrow and shallow syncline, which is without any tectonic complication. The southern part of these structures has tectonic contact (in a synclinal tongue shape) with the evaporite <b>diapir.</b> Their anticlinal <b>structures</b> are very prolonged. The eastern line (Trebeshina, Nemercka and Mitsikeli anticline lines) continues northward with the Terpani and Berati anticlines, while the western one (Goliko, Lunxheri and Bureto anticline line) continue with only with Rehova anticline. The southern part of the Nemercka anticline (the biggest of the Berati belt) has a slight eastern asymmetry, and more to the south it passes into a fun shape, with an overturned backthrust in the east flank (Fig.  17), which is a result of an unsuccessful diapir. This anticline, near the Timfeu massive, is unified with the western line and is cut in two pieces from the Delvinakion cross fault (Fig.  14). The influence of the diapir is not noticeable in the Trebeshina anticline (Fig.  14), whose characteristics are similar to those we have seen throughout the Berati anticlinal belt. All the anticlines, mentioned above, are the brahi-anticlinal type. South to Qafa Kicoku (Fig.  14), an intrusive development of the evaporitic diapir is observed. The Zavrohon diapir, which is a surface diapir, is very intense in this sector, having developed a weak tectonic loop. This diapir is tectonically very complicated, which has influenced the structural model of the overlying deposits (Figs.  12, 14, 15). The structures of the western line (Bureto-Lunxheri-Goliko-Rehova) have western asymmetry and are limited by a regional fault that has an overthrust character (Figs.  14, 16, 17). To the south, the Bureto anticlinal has tectonic contact with the Zavrohon diapir {{and at the same time}} it appears in a specific view as a synclinal “tongue” and structural “nose” (Fig.  14). The Bureto anticline in its middle part has a monocline form, but to the north and south, it changes into the structural “nose” form (Fig.  14). The southern part has tectonic contact (in a synclinal tongue shape) with the Zavrohon diapir. The evaporites of Glina, which meet in the tectonic fault of the western flank of the Bureto anticline, are on the continuity of the Zavrohon diapir, which has helped the amplitude of the regional overthrust of the Berati anticlinal belt. Northward, the fault of the western flank of the Lunxheri anticline continues to the eastern flank of the Goliko anticline (Fig.  16) that looks like a horst under the influence of the unsuccessful diapir (Fig.  16). The anticline of Goliko has a fan-shape and development morphology. In this anticline, secondary structures are found. Besides the above characteristic, in the structures distinguished set up of them as “steps”. In addition, we see the existence of secondary folds in “nose” shape and with tectonic complications (Fig.  14).|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a {{reconstruction of the}} course of events during the Warta Glaciation in the Łódź Region. It includes an analysis of the Warta stratigraphic unit, a description of development and decay features of the Warta ice-sheet (Late Saalian ice sheet) as well as features of the environment in which it functioned. The study puts major emphasis on the reconstruction of the process of shaping glaciogenic landscape, prepared on the basis of lithofacial features of sediments they were composed of, relations to older and younger sediments, and traces of tectonic activity. The reconstruction of the course of Warta ice-sheet transgression and retreat in the Łódź Region against the background of the entire Eurasian ice-sheet during MIS 6, indicates the presence of individual features and large-space character of this glaciation in relation to the situation during the preceding warming, when glaciation extent was limited to a fragment of Fennoskandia. The distinctiveness of the Warta ice-sheet is supported by a number of conditions, one of them being the presence of complex structures which point to a wide array of glacial events, including several short stages of ice-sheet readvance in the post-maximum period. These sub-phases or phases of the cataglacial period of the Warta Glaciation were noticeable in different regions, which suggests activation of individual elements of the stream-based distribution of ice-sheet masses. It is more characteristic of complete glaciation than of a smaller unit. Independently of local dissimilarities, in areas where glacial accumulation prevailed, one basic level of glacial till occurs, relatively easy to identify with the use of various methods. The Warta Glaciation took place between the pre-Warta warming, whose climatostratigraphic rank has not been fully established, and the Eemian interglacial, which is the best documented interglacial apart from the Holocene in both marine and land areas. In the Łódź region there are several uncertain locations of pre-Warta warming {{and at the same time}} several dozen documented stands of the Eemian interglacial period, mainly in kettle holes, developed on the surface of the Warta Glaciation sediments. These stands also provide evidence for the existence of the Eemian lakeland, characterised by an abundance of kettle holes. Owing to the above asymmetry of the stratigraphic framework of the Warta unit, the former practice of including the Warta stage in the Odra Glaciation is not fully justified. If the pre-Warta warming is not considered as an interglacial, it seems correct to include the Odra stage in the wider Warta unit, which has a well-defined border with the Eemian interglacial period. The debatability of the climatostratigraphic rank of the pre-Warta warming is the reason for difficulties with determining the rank of the Warta stage. The dispute has been in progress ever since the first findings of sediments from this warming period, both in the Łódź region and in other parts of Europe. To put it simply, it often comes down to determine whether it was a fairly warm interstadial or rather a cold interglacial. Because of the presence of organic stands from pre-Warta warming which have not received clear stratigraphic definition and absolute dating, this dispute has not yielded any unequivocal conclusions yet. Irrespective of it, attention should be paid to other evidence which concerns only the cold stage of the Warta Glaciation, and not the limiting periods. The evidence includes: morphological individuality of Wartian forms and sediments on the surface, well-developed lithostratigraphic features of sediments from this stage – characteristic of complete glaciations, appropriate periglacial structures present beyond the ice-sheet extent, and global-scale records of this cool period in deep-see profiles, cave deposits etc. Duration of the Warta Glaciation (sensu stricto), i. e. as a period of advance and retreat of the ice-sheet, in the Łódź Region might have been relatively short, perhaps only several thousand years. A similar time interval is also suggested in other parts of the Wartian relief zone, including Germany among other places. It may have been a small section of the cold stage of Warta. It is possible to think so on the basis of the following: lithofacial profiles characteristic of high accumulation rate, poor development of marginal forms along the maximum extent line, underlining of glaciogenic profiles with periglacial deposits, as well as numerous analogies to the main stadial of the Vistulian (Weichselian) Glaciation. However, it must be kept in mind that the thesis about the relatively short duration of glacial events is not confirmed only by the TL and OSL absolute dating results to date. For this problem to be solved, a major advance in the dating methodology is necessary. The dynamics of ice-sheet growth and the way of clearing more diverse relief of the foreland during transgression were analysed. Considerable differences in ice-sheet dynamics were found between the two main lobes: the South Greater Poland lobe and the South Mazovian lobe, as well as within the range of individual lobes. It was dependent on the way of alimenting them in the firn fields, diversity of climatic conditions in the ablation zone, thermal properties of the ice-sheet base (dependent largely on the geothermal stream density) and other base properties, in particular the distribution of proglacial lakes and high pore-pressure underground water. The course of deglaciation was also reconstructed in detail, in both temporal and spatial aspects. During deglaciation, cases of activated ice streams with probable low climatostratigraphic rank but important for the terrain’s morphology were distinguished and denominated provisionally as sub-phases of Dobrzynka, Ner and Bzura. Deglaciation zones were marked off in individual lobes on the basis of spatial and dynamic diversification of the course of glaciofluvial accumulation processes recorded in deposits and formations. Transitional thermal regime presumably dominated in the marginal zone of the ice-sheet dome, while warm thermal regime prevailed in glacial depressions. The regime may have changed in time, form transitional to warm and vice versa. It is also possible that cold regime occurred locally in glacial elevations, mostly within the extent of the South Mazovian lobe. It was particularly important for the dynamics of glacial streams and till accumulation, with regard to both its final thickness and structure. Individual ice streams, with different bottom regime, may have moved in confluence, but at greatly varying speeds. The fact that ice-sheet adapted its shape to the existing relief during transgression had its consequences during deglaciation, which often led to permanence of major relief forms. Valleys deepened by glacial and glaciofluvial erosion were partially refilled during deglaciation. That was also where initial river flow originated later. Small glacial plateaus were usually covered with a thin layer of glaciofluvial deposits and glacial till of corresponding shape. The more efficient glaciofluvial accumulation in the watershed zones is locally significant. Sometimes, both glacial currents and subglacial trough-forming waters directly eroded the Mesozoic bedrock. There were examples of “typical” exaration and detersion as well as efficient erosion of the solid bedrock by subglacial waters. Taking place in limited areas, these processes had more linear than superficial effects. Formations along the line of maximum extent are poorly developed in the entire region, which indicates lack of longer stabilisation of ice-sheet front along this borderline. This results in the long-known difficulties with determining the exact location of this line. Metasynchronous development of individual glacial streams is also very likely. As in other segments of the Wartian zone in Poland, one can question the existence of sensu stricto proglacial valleys in the analysed region. Sandar with proximal features as well as hills and other glaciomarginal forms are rare and small. However, counterparts of these forms developed in the internal lobe zones in the form of a system of small marginal valleys, internal sandar and kames of various types. The main reasons for this kind of spatial distribution of forms and lithosomes of water accumulation include subglacial relief and ice-sheet’s vulnerability to surface decay. Analysis of relief and deposits of the Warta Glaciation suggests the occurrence of short stages of glacial stream activation during ice-sheet decay, with possible low climatostratigraphic rank. These were provisionally denoted as subphases of Dobrzynka, Ner and Bzura and their presumable extents were indicated. They did not cover a fragment of the ice-sheet dome in the South-Eastern part of the region, i. e. in the South Mazovian lobe. The same glacial stream probably underwent further advances, but subsequent kinematic waves shifted its axis in an eastward direction. Distinguishing subphases and various lithostratigraphic traces of deglaciation processes provided the basis for further division into deglaciation zones in individual lobes. A complex course of ice-sheet decay processes was found. In the scale of the Łódź region, areal deglaciation predominated, which is indicated by a matching inventory of glacial landforms: kames and kettle holes, which constituted vast concentrations. Some of the landforms, sometimes in the form of chain structures, owe their origination to active pressure from ice-sheet front on older formations as a result of rapid, short-term transgression (surge) and subsequent rapid glaciofluvial and ablative accumulation. Larger forms often indicate more complex genesis. They may have originated from glaciofluvial and ablative accumulation being superimposed on kame accumulation, after a small-scale advance of ice-sheet snout. In the analysed region, many complex forms were found. For example, part of the structure indicates kame accumulation conditions in stagnant and dead ice, another part of the form may be a result of a dynamic bulldozing, while still another part – a result of subsequent glaciomarginal accumulation. Some landforms, so far regarded as kames, should be moved to other categories. This concerns in particular hills, often asymmetric, built from transitional segments of glaciofluvial cones and glaciolacustrine deltas, with traces of ice contact, which document active glacial ice sedimentation. Stability of tunnels in ice, indicated by the presence of eskers in various deglaciation zones, proves the relationship with a single main ice-sheet advance, short duration of ice-sheet coverage, simultaneous accumulation over a considerable distance and rapid accumulation of esker deposits. Identification of diversified esker accumulation ranging from the stage of N-type tunnels to accumulation in intraglacial canyons of kame sedimentation type indicates short-term functioning of live ice and rapid progress of deglaciation. Slow glacioisostatic readjustment, related to the functioning of the Warta ice-sheet, resulted in considerable stress in the lithosphere, which could be discharged in the form of tectonic shocks. Many deformation structures, including clastic dykes of significant size, indicate the possibility of tectonic shocks of up to 6 °. Perhaps, as was the case during final periods of other glaciations, tectonic activity increased during deglaciation of the Warta ice-sheet. In many places Wartian deposits are deformed to the form of <b>diapirs.</b> These <b>structures</b> could originate as a result of many different processes: unstable density stratification in hydrated deposits, deposit fluidisation resulting from high stresses in the transgressing ice-sheet, tectonic shocks, as well as differences in pressure from deposits and neighbouring ice on the underlying or adjacent plastic formations. The mechanism of their origination was largely influenced by lithological features of the deposits, and in particular their susceptibility to plastic deformations and varying pore-water pressure. The Warta ice-sheet advanced to areas influenced by short-term or mild periglacial processes, which is suggested by traces of aeolian activity of surface material and local occurrence of periglacial structures. Poorly developed permafrost was probably of insular type. During the glaciation, there was a tendency of increasing involvement of meltwaters, which warmed up and degraded the manifestations of permafrost processes. Traces of material blocks, preserving the structure, numerous in the analysed deposits, may prove their short-time freezing and carry no real paleogeographic significance. It is necessary to stress the importance of permafrost structures from Vistulian, epigenetic, e. g. sandy wedges. These structures, usually completely preserved, prove that no further (e. g. in late Vistulian) significant slope profile modifications occurred at their locations. Sometimes regarded as indicators of effective periglacial denudation, these structures may be interpreted as evidence for periglacial stabilisation of the relief. Among the Vistulian periglacial processes, some relief-forming role was undoubtedly played by aeolian processes, which is indicated by deflation-corrasion pavements and accumulation of aeolian sands in closed depressions and in deposits of Vistulian rivers.
