30|$|The second {{indicator}} {{to identify the}} population <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of accessibility poverty is a high share of expenditure for mobility in the net household budget. The share of expenditure {{is not the most}} obvious indicator of transport poverty risk. However, it may be clear that households spending a very high share of their income on transport {{may not be able to}} continue to do so if the circumstances change, for instance if oil prices increase or if households expenses go up unexpectedly. Under such conditions, households may be forced to adjust their mobility patterns and even reduce their actual mobility, or alternatively give up on other essential goods [47, 16, 37]. This suggests that households with high transport <b>expenditures</b> are <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of transport poverty and thus also <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of accessibility poverty. For this reason, we employ this indicator in our estimate of households in accessibility poverty below.|$|R

30|$|In theory, adverse {{selection}} {{can lead to}} the unraveling of insurance markets (Rothschild and Stiglitz 1976). Not knowing each insured’s health risk, insurers frequently do not charge sufficiently different premiums to high-risk versus low-risk individuals. Thus, for any premium that allows the insurer to break even, insurance is an attractive purchase for the high-risk but not low-risk individuals. As a result, fewer low-risk persons demand insurance. To break even on the remaining persons it covers, the insurer must raise premiums. But at higher premiums, some people who bought insurance before decide against buying insurance. These are the lower risk subgroup of the higher risk group that purchased insurance. Again, with the resulting higher risk pool of insureds, the insurer finds that its premium income is insufficient. So it raises premiums again, and the healthier persons in this group drop out of the insurance market. This process of unraveling could continue until only a very few high-risk individuals remain in the market. All {{the rest of the population}} is rendered worse off because they have lost a mechanism for reducing <b>expenditure</b> <b>risk</b> <b>at</b> premiums that are appropriate for the health expenditures they are likely to incur (Sloan and Hsieh 2012).|$|R

Even though {{eliminating}} malaria {{from the}} endemic margins {{is a part}} of the Global Malaria Action Plan, little guidance exists on what resources are needed to transition from controlling malaria to eliminating it. Using Philippines as an example, this study aimed to (1) estimate the financial resources used by sub-national malaria programs in different phases during elimination and (2) understand how different environmental and organizational factors may influence expenditure levels and spending proportions. The Philippines provides an opportunity to study variations in sub-national programs because its epidemiological and ecological diversity, devolved health system, and progressive elimination strategy all allow greater flexibility for lower-level governments to direct activities, but also create challenges for coordination and resource mobilization. Through key informant interviews and archival record retrieval in four selected provinces chosen based on eco-epidemiological variation, expenditures associated with provincial malaria programs were collected for selected years (mid- 1990 s to 2010). Results show that <b>expenditures</b> per person <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> per year decrease as programs progress from a state of controlled low-endemic malaria to elimination to prevention of reintroduction regardless of whether elimination was deliberately planned.

40|$|Background and Objective: Crohn’s disease (CD) -related {{complications}} {{account for}} a substantial proportion of IBD-related healthcare <b>expenditure.</b> Identifying patients <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for complications may allow for targeted use of early therapeutic interventions to alter this natural course. The objective of this project was to develop risk prediction models of CD-related surgery and complications. Methods: Using data from the REACT cluster-randomized clinical trial (N= 1898 from 41 community practices), prediction models were developed and internally validated for CD-related surgery and CD-related complications, defined as the first CD-related surgery, hospitalization or complication within 24 months. Performance of each model was assessed in terms of discrimination and calibration, as well as decision curves and net benefit analyses. Results: There were 130 (6. 8 %) CD-related surgeries and 504 (26. 6 %) CD-related complications during the 24 -month follow-up period. Selected baseline predictors for predicting surgery included age, gender, disease location, HBI score, stool frequency, antimetabolite or 5 -aminosalicylates use, {{and the presence of}} a fistula, abscess or abdominal mass. Selected predictors of complications included those same factors for surgery, corticosteroid and TNF-antagonist use and excluded 5 -aminosalicylate use. The discrimination ability, as measured by optimism-corrected c-statistic, was 0. 70 for the surgery model, and 0. 62 for the complication model. Score charts and nomograms were developed to facilitate future risk score calculation. Conclusions: Risk prediction models for CD-related surgery and CD-related complications were developed using clinical trial data involving community gastroenterology practices. These models need to be externally validated before being used to guide management of CD...|$|R

Results indicate that personality traits were mostly unrelated to resting metabolic rate and energy <b>expenditure</b> <b>at</b> normal walking pace. However, those who scored lower on neuroticism (r = 20. 12) and higher on extraversion (r = 0. 11), openness (r = 0. 13), and conscientiousness (r = 0. 09) had significantly higher energy <b>expenditure</b> <b>at</b> peak walking pace. In addition to greater aerobic capacity, individuals with a more resilient personality profile walked faster and were more efficient in that they required less energy per meter walked. The associations between personality and energy expenditure were not moderated by age or sex, but were in part explained by the proportion of fat mass. In conclusion, differences in personality may matter the most during more challenging activities that require cardiorespiratory fitness. These findings suggest potential pathways that link personality to health outcomes, such a...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Sri Lanka has a {{long history}} of malaria control, and over the past decade has had {{dramatic}} declines in cases amid a national conflict. A case study of Sri Lanka's malaria programme was conducted to characterize the programme and explain recent progress. METHODS: The case study employed qualitative and quantitative methods. Data were collected from published and grey literature, district-level and national records, and thirty-three key informant interviews. Expenditures in two districts for two years [...] 2004 and 2009 [...] were compiled. FINDINGS: Malaria incidence in Sri Lanka has declined by 99. 9 % since 1999. During this time, there were increases in the proportion of malaria infections due to Plasmodium vivax, and the proportion of infections occurring in adult males. Indoor residual spraying and distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets have likely contributed to the low transmission. Entomological surveillance was maintained. A strong passive case detection system captures infections and active case detection was introduced. When comparing conflict and non-conflict districts, vector control and surveillance measures were maintained in conflict areas, often with higher coverage reported in conflict districts. One of two districts in the study reported a 48 % decline in malaria programme <b>expenditure</b> per person <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> from 2004 to 2009. The other district had stable malaria spending. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Malaria is now at low levels in Sri Lanka [...] 124 indigenous cases were found in 2011. The majority of infections occur in adult males and are due to P. vivax. Evidence-driven policy and an ability to adapt to new circumstances contributed to this decline. Malaria interventions were maintained in the conflict districts despite an ongoing war. Sri Lanka has set a goal of eliminating malaria by the end of 2014. Early identification and treatment of infections, especially imported ones, together with effective surveillance and response, will be critical to achieving this goal...|$|R
