Hybridization of this plasmid to AccI-digested genomic DNAs of 26 C. neoformans strains generated 21 unique <b>DNA</b> <b>fingerprints.</b> The <b>DNA</b> <b>fingerprints</b> of isolates within the same serotype were more similar to one another than to those from different serotypes.

5|$|Specific mating {{courtship}} occurs {{more often}} in the Fall months and usually during the afternoon hours from 11:00 to 13:00 when many of the turtles {{are out in the}} population feeding. Mating is based on a male competitive hierarchy where a few higher ranked males gain the majority of mates in the population. Male wood turtles fight to gain access to female mates. These fights involve aggressive behaviors such as biting or chasing one another, and the males defend themselves by retreating their heads into their hard shells. The higher ranked winning males in the hierarchy system have a greater number of offspring than the lower ranked male individuals, increasing the dominant male's fitness. Female wood turtles mate with multiple males and are able to store sperm from multiple mates. Although the mechanism of sperm storage is unknown for the Wood Turtle species, other turtle species have internal compartments that can store viable sperm for years. Multiple mating ensures fertilization of all the female's eggs and often results in multiple paternity of a clutch, which is a common phenomenon exhibited by many marine and freshwater turtles. Multiple paternity patterns have been made evident in wood turtle populations by <b>DNA</b> <b>fingerprinting.</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> of turtles involves using an oligonucleotide probe to produce gender specific markers, ultimately providing multi-locus DNA markers.|$|E

40|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>fingerprints</b> of 46 {{human cell}} lines were derived using {{minisatellite}} probes for hypervariable genetic loci. The incidence of 121 HaeIII DNA fragments among 33 cell lines derived from unrelated individuals {{was used to}} estimate allelic and genotypic frequencies for each fragment and for composite individual <b>DNA</b> <b>fingerprints.</b> We present a quantitative estimate {{of the extent of}} genetic difference between individuals, an estimate based on the percentage of restriction fragments at which they differ. The average percent difference (APD) among pairwise combinations from the population of 33 unrelated cell lines was 76. 9 %, compared with the APD in band sharing among cell lines derived from the same individual ({{less than or equal to}} 1. 2 %). Included in this survey were nine additional cell lines previously implicated as HeLa cell derivatives, and these lines were clearly confirmed as such by <b>DNA</b> <b>fingerprints</b> (APD less than or equal to 0. 6 %). On the basis of fragment frequencies in the tested cell line population, a simple genetic model was developed to estimate the frequencies of each <b>DNA</b> <b>fingerprint</b> in the population. The median incidence was 2. 9 X 10 (- 17), and the range was 2. 4 X 10 (- 21) to 6. 6 X 10 (- 15). This value approximates the probability that a second cell line selected at random from unrelated individuals will match a given <b>DNA</b> <b>fingerprint.</b> Related calculations address the chance that any two <b>DNA</b> <b>fingerprints</b> would be identical among a large group of cell lines.

40|$|The rep-PCR <b>DNA</b> <b>fingerprint</b> technique, {{which uses}} {{repetitive}} intergenic DNA sequences, was investigated {{as a way}} to differentiate between human and animal sources of fecal pollution. BOX and REP primers were used to generate <b>DNA</b> <b>fingerprints</b> from Escherichia coli strains isolated from human and animal sources (geese, ducks, cows, pigs, chickens, and sheep). Our initial studies revealed that the <b>DNA</b> <b>fingerprints</b> obtained with the BOX primer were more effective for grouping E. coli strains than the <b>DNA</b> <b>fingerprints</b> obtained with REP primers. The BOX primer <b>DNA</b> <b>fingerprints</b> of 154 E. coli isolates were analyzed by using the Jaccard band-matching algorithm. Jackknife analysis of the resulting similarity coefficients revealed that 100 % of the chicken and cow isolates and between 78 and 90 % of the human, goose, duck, pig, and sheep isolates were assigned to the correct source groups. A dendrogram constructed by using Jaccard similarity coefficients almost completely separated the human isolates from the nonhuman isolates. Multivariate analysis of variance, a form of discriminant analysis, successfully differentiated the isolates and placed them in the appropriate source groups. Taken together, our results indicate that rep-PCR performed with the BOX A 1 R primer may be a useful and effective tool for rapidly determining sources of fecal pollution...|$|R
