5000|$|A triple tree ("triple clamp" [...] (US) or [...] "yoke" [...] (UK)) {{attaches}} {{the fork}} tubes {{to the frame}} via steering head bearings, which allow the fork assembly to pivot from side to side, and therefore steer the motorcycle. Most bikes have upper and lower triple trees, providing two solid clamping points that keep the fork tubes parallel while also connecting the forks to the frame via the steering head bearings.With the tendency to employ fork tubes with single action damping, fork triple trees need to be reinforced more than when the <b>forks</b> <b>shared</b> both damping roles, because the rigidity of the triple trees is relied upon to distribute the forces within the forks without flex.|$|R
5000|$|RTEMS {{does not}} provide any form of memory {{management}} or processes. In POSIX terminology, it implements a single process, multithreaded environment. This {{is reflected in the}} fact that RTEMS provides nearly all POSIX services other than those which are related to memory mapping, process <b>forking,</b> or <b>shared</b> memory. RTEMS closely corresponds to POSIX Profile 52 which is [...] "single process, threads, filesystem".|$|R
40|$|Abstract. While UML state {{machines}} {{are widely used}} to specify dy-namic systems behaviours, their semantics is described informally, which prevents the complex systems verification. In this paper, we propose a formalisation of concurrent UML {{state machines}} using coloured Petri nets. We consider in particular concurrent aspects (orthogonal regions, <b>forks,</b> joins, <b>shared</b> variables), the hierarchy induced by composite states and their associated activities, internal/external/local transitions, and entry/exit/do behaviours. ...|$|R

Trails pass along the borders of hayfields and the wetlands of Mill Brook, over rocky knolls, and to the pitchfork mill ruins. <b>Fork</b> Factory Brook <b>shares</b> and trailhead with Rocky Woods, located on Hartford Road in Medfield.|$|R

For instance, the Linux operating system, with its commercial offspring Android and ChromeOS, is a highly successful result of a software [...] "remix culture".|$|R
50|$|In central Thailand, {{sitting on}} a chair, eating at a table and using a <b>fork,</b> spoon and <b>shared</b> spoon are longstanding customs (Rama IV). For Thai rich family dining, {{variously}} shaped napkins are added {{on the table and}} also employ waiters or waitresses to serve the food and beverages beside the table. For some poor people the shared spoon is not used.|$|R
50|$|As a semi-satellite of KXMC-TV, KXMD-TV {{is part of}} the KX Television {{regional}} network. Programming, {{master control}} and internal operations for the entire KX network is provided by Bismarck's KXMB-TV, which airs mostly separate local news programming from KXMC/KXMD and simulcasts it on KXMA-TV in Dickinson. The KX network relays CBS network programming and other programs across central and western North Dakota, as well as bordering counties in Montana and South Dakota. KXMD clears all network and syndicated programming as provided through its parent but airs separate station identifications and commercial inserts. KXMD serves the northwestern portion of the Bismarck/Minot market. The four stations along with ABC affiliates WDAY-TV in Fargo and WDAZ-TV in Grand <b>Forks</b> often <b>share</b> news stories. The four stations are counted as a single unit for ratings purposes.|$|R
50|$|The Parsnip River is a 240 km long {{river in}} central British Columbia, Canada. It flows {{generally}} north-westward from the Parsnip Glacier in the Hart Ranges to the Parsnip Reach of Williston Lake, {{formed by the}} impounding of {{the waters of the}} Peace River by the W.A.C. Bennett Dam in 1968. Prior to that, the Parsnip joined with the Finlay River to form the Peace at Finlay <b>Forks,</b> with both <b>sharing</b> an alignment along the Rocky Mountain Trench.|$|R
40|$|Forward {{inference}} {{techniques such}} as sequential Monte Carlo and particle Markov chain Monte Carlo for probabilistic programming can be im-plemented in any programming language by cre-ative use of standardized operating system func-tionality including processes, <b>forking,</b> mutexes, and <b>shared</b> memory. Exploiting this we have de-fined, developed, and tested a probabilistic pro-gramming language intermediate representation language we call probabilistic C, which itself can be compiled to machine code by standard com-pilers and linked to operating system libraries yielding an efficient, scalable, portable proba-bilistic programming compilation target. This opens up a new hardware and systems research path for optimizing probabilistic programming systems. 1...|$|R
50|$|KXMA is {{considered}} a semi-satellite of KXMB-TV in Bismarck, which is the flagship station of the four station KX Television regional network. KXMC-TV in Minot is the oldest station and the former flagship station of the network, while KXMB provides master control and some internal operations of the entire network. KXMA airs a time-shifted simulcast of KXMB in Mountain Time {{for most of the}} day. However, KXMA airs separate commercials and station identifications. The KX network relays CBS network programming and other programs across central and western North Dakota, as well as bordering counties in Montana and South Dakota. KXMA clears all network and syndicated programming as provided through its parent but airs separate station identifications and commercial inserts. KXMA serves the southwestern portion of the Bismarck/Minot market. The four stations along with ABC affiliates WDAY-TV in Fargo and WDAZ-TV in Grand <b>Forks</b> often <b>share</b> news stories. The four stations are counted as a single unit for ratings purposes. Unlike the other KX stations, KXMA airs The CW Plus on its main signal and CBS programming (which aired on 2.1 until 2016) on DT2.|$|R
40|$|In {{the next}} years, {{processor}} architectures based on much {{larger numbers of}} cores will be most likely the model to continue Moores Law style throughput gains. This not only results in many more jobs in parallel running the LHC Run 1 era monolithic applications. Also the memory requirements of these processes push the workernode architectures to the limit. One solution is parallelizing the application itself, through <b>forking</b> and memory <b>sharing</b> or through threaded frameworks. CMS is following all of these approaches and has a comprehensive strategy to schedule multi-core jobs on the GRID based on the glideIn WMS submission infrastructure. We will present the individual components of the strategy, from special site specific queues used during provisioning of resources and implications to scheduling; to dynamic partitioning within a single pilot to allow to transition to multi-core or whole-node scheduling on site level without disallowing single-core jobs. In this presentation, we will present the experiences made with the multi-core scheduling modes and give an outlook of further developments working towards the restart of the LHC in 2015...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improvement {{of a standard}} algorithm for detecting dead-lock potentials in multi-threaded programs, in that it reduces the number of false positives. The standard algorithm works as follows. The multi-threaded program under observation is executed, while lock and unlock events are observed. A graph of locks is built, with edges between locks symbolizing locking orders. Any cycle in the graph signifies a potential for a deadlock. The typical standard example is the group of dining philosophers <b>sharing</b> <b>forks.</b> The algorithm is interesting because it can catch deadlock potentials even though no deadlocks occur in the examined trace, {{and at the same}} time it scales very well in contrast t o more formal approaches to deadlock detection. The algorithm, however, can yield false positives (as well as false negatives). The extension of the algorithm described in this paper reduces the amount of false positives for three particular cases: when a gate lock protects a cycle, when a single thread introduces a cycle, and when the code segments in different threads that cause the cycle can actually not execute in parallel. The paper formalizes a theory for dynamic deadlock detection and compares it to model checking and static analysis techniques. It furthermore describes an implementation for analyzing Java programs and its application to two case studies: a planetary rover and a space craft altitude control system...|$|R
