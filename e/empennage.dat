5|$|Directional {{stability}} {{was achieved}} by four fixed vanes, two vertical and two horizontal, attached {{at the rear of}} the gas-bag, and by a long vertical vane running along the main axis of the gas-bag from the centre of the elliptical frame to its rear. Horizontal motion was controlled by the movement of a balanced rudder at the rear of an <b>empennage</b> on a long boom, mounted below the gas-bag and aft of the gondola (see lead image). The <b>empennage</b> consisted of vertical and horizontal vanes arranged like the fletching of an arrow, behind which the vertical rudder was mounted. During a refit in 1907 the vertical vanes of the <b>empennage</b> were modified, as is shown in the accompanying illustration.|$|E
5|$|The Patrie {{was then}} {{deflated}} for alterations {{that included the}} addition of a 500cubic metre (17,660ft³) cylindrical section to the gas-bag, a change to the <b>empennage</b> (as mentioned above) and provision of new propellers.|$|E
5|$|The F-22 Raptor is a {{fifth-generation}} fighter that {{is considered}} fourth generation in stealth aircraft technology by the USAF. It is the first operational aircraft to combine supercruise, supermaneuverability, stealth, and sensor fusion in a single weapons platform. The Raptor has clipped delta wings with a reverse sweep on the rear, four <b>empennage</b> surfaces, and a retractable tricycle landing gear. Flight control surfaces include leading-edge flaps, flaperons, ailerons, rudders on the canted vertical stabilizers, and all-moving horizontal tails; these surfaces also serve as speed brakes.|$|E

5|$|Boeing built a final {{assembly}} line in Washington at its Renton factory, home of 707, 727, and 737 production, to produce the 757. Early in the development program, Boeing, British Airways, and Rolls-Royce unsuccessfully lobbied the British aircraft industry to manufacture 757 wings. Ultimately, {{about half of the}} aircraft's components, including the wings, nose section, and <b>empennage,</b> were produced in-house at Boeing facilities, and the remainder subcontracted to primarily U.S.-based companies. Fairchild Aircraft made the leading edge slats, Grumman supplied the flaps, and Rockwell International produced the main fuselage. Production ramp-up for the new narrow-body airliner coincided with the winding-down of the 727 program, and {{final assembly}} of the first aircraft began in January 1981.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{similarity}} of the IAe-27a and Tank's redesign of the Ta 183, Juan Ignacio San Martín, {{the director of the}} Institute merged the two parallel projects as the IAe 33 Pulqui II. The fuselage of Tank's design was further adapted to use the IAe-27a's undercarriage. The shoulder-mounted, negative-incidence wings were swept back 40°, an even greater sweep angle than that of the Ta 183, and given a small amount of anhedral. Comparable to the Ta 183's engine placement, the Nene engine was situated aft of the cockpit, near the center of gravity with engine maintenance and service facilitated through the removal of the tail section. The airframe featured a graceful, 50° swept-back T-shaped <b>empennage</b> and a pressurized cockpit topped by a clear bubble-type canopy, faired into the dorsal fuselage. Armor was provided around the cockpit and a bulletproof windscreen was incorporated. Fuel capacity was initially 1,250 l (275 Imp. gal.) internally and 800 l (176 Imp. gal.) in the wings. Armament was planned to include four 20mm cannon, a pair mounted in a staggered, near-ventral position along each side of the fuselage slightly set back from the jet intake.|$|E
5|$|With {{the worst}} of the aircraft's {{problems}} believed to have been resolved, the XR-1 was submitted for service testing by the Army Air Forces in 1943. During the course of the Army's evaluations, the XR-1's <b>empennage</b> failed during structural testing, the surfaces being strengthened as a result and testing, following the repairs, resuming in 1944. Despite the modifications to the design, however, the XR-1 still proved to be deficient in control authority. In July 1943, the XR-1 program suffered a setback when the aircraft crashed, seriously injuring test pilot Jim Ray, who had replaced Leavitt following the latter's dismissal from the company. The crash was caused by an inspector's error in leaving a suspect part on the aircraft, the rotor hub failing in flight {{as a result of the}} decision. The aircraft was repairable, but it would be a year before the XR-1 was ready to fly again.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the first}} of a series of {{articles}} that deal with the calculation of the aerodynamic unsteady forces on lifting surfaces (wing, <b>empennages)</b> in the presence of the fuselage. The aim of this work is multiple: the calculation of flutter, gust effect, aerodynamic response to manoeuvres, flapping wings. The first paper presents the lifting surface model, the integral equation of the oscillating surface, its numerical solution and some numerical results. The next papers will deal with the aerodynamic modeling of the fuselage in the presence of harmonic disturbances as those produced by the fuselage itself or an oscillating wing. Finally, we present the last step to achieve the interference: modeling of the fuselage lift due to the wing or <b>empennages...</b>|$|R
50|$|The MB-4's three-bay biplane wings {{were all}} new, with ailerons {{on the upper}} wing. It had a {{conventional}} tailwheel undercarriage and had two separate tail assemblies, which were standard MB-3 <b>empennages.</b> Dual controls were fitted, with the pilot able to disconnect the co-pilot's controls, {{but there were no}} means of communication between the two cockpits.|$|R
5|$|Required {{to tender}} {{by the end}} of April 1947, work began on receipt of Specification B.35/46 at Avro, led by {{technical}} director Roy Chadwick and chief designer Stuart Davies; the type designation was Avro 698. It was obvious to the design team that conventional aircraft could not satisfy the specification; knowing little about high-speed flight and unable to glean much from the Royal Aircraft Establishment or the US, they investigated German Second World War swept wing research. The team estimated that an otherwise conventional aircraft, with a swept wing of 45°, would have doubled the weight requirement. Realising that swept wings increase longitudinal stability, the team deleted the tail (<b>empennage)</b> and the supporting fuselage, it thus became a swept-back flying wing with only a rudimentary forward fuselage and a fin (vertical stabilizer) at each wingtip. The estimated weight was now only 50% over the requirement; a delta shape resulted from reducing the wingspan and maintaining the wing area by filling in the space between the wingtips, which enabled the specification to be met. Though Alexander Lippisch is generally credited as the pioneer of the delta wing, Chadwick's team had followed its own logical design process. The initial design submission had four large turbojets stacked in pairs buried in the wing either side of the centreline. Outboard of the engines were two bomb-bays.|$|E
5|$|The aircraft's {{construction}} was a novelty for the time. In {{contrast to the}} monoplane described in the July 1910 patent application, the exhibit was a sesquiplane which complicated the construction, but in return solved lateral stability control issues. The cantilevered wings were held in place at three points by tubular steel struts without any bracing from flying wires. According to Coandă's description the wings were built with metal spars, but existing photographs of the construction show a completely wooden internal structure. The trailing edges of the upper wing could be twisted separately or together for lateral control or braking during landing, and were controlled by pedals in the two-seat open cockpit. The fuselage, painted reddish-brown and highly polished, was described by The Technical World magazine as having a framework of steel, though the construction photographs indicate {{that it had a}} wooden framework. This was triangular in cross-section with convex ribs edged with strips of steel, and strengthened with a covering of heat-shaped moulded plywood. Tubular radiators for engine cooling were located {{on either side of the}} cockpit. The vertical struts from the wings were secured to the fuselage with steel collars fixed with screws. The fuselage terminated in a cruciform <b>empennage</b> with control surfaces at 45° angles to vertical and horizontal. Four triangular surfaces at the rear of the tail were controlled using a pair of large Antoinette VII-style steering wheels mounted outside of the cockpit, one on each side, and were used for pitch and directional control. It was an early instance of what are now known as ruddervators. Forward of the tail was a small horizontal stabiliser. The fuel tank was located in the fuselage between the engine and the cockpit.|$|E

50|$|The <b>empennages</b> of the S.55 and S.63 were similar, {{though the}} latter had two {{vertical}} tails rather than three. These were wire-braced and, including balanced rudders, quadrantal in profile, with one attached to each girder. A rectangular tailplane, mounted {{at a high}} incidence, linked the girders and projected beyond them. It carried a semi-elliptical, balanced elevator.|$|R
50|$|The D.IX was {{the final}} {{development}} of the D.VII, an outstanding World War I fighter. It had a 300 hp (224 kW) Hispano-Suiza 8Fb (Type 42) water-cooled V-8, much {{more powerful than the}} D.VII's original 160 hp (120 kW) Mercedes D III engine and even most other engines experimentally fitted to this airframe. Engine installation apart, the D.VII and D.IX were externally similar apart from their <b>empennages.</b>|$|R
25|$|When in forward flight, the Aeroscraft is {{controlled}} by the aerodynamic control surfaces (vertical stabilizers, <b>empennages</b> and canards); however, the low speed control system aids the pilot in lower wind conditions such as during VTOL and hover. The LSC system acts as a rear thruster to propel the vehicle in forward flight, and permits the thrust to be redirected while in hover to help the vehicle maintain desired positioning and orientation.|$|R

50|$|Flight {{testing was}} very positive, and the HA-100 {{performed}} well in comparative tests against the American T-28 Trojan, {{leading to a}} contract for 40 of the aircraft. However, obtaining engines remained a stumbling block, with Spain unable to afford to import the Wright engine in quantity. Eventually, production ground to a halt, and the decision was taken to scrap the airframes under construction, salvaging only the wings and <b>empennages</b> for use on the HA-200 project.|$|R
50|$|Their <b>empennages</b> were conventional, with plywood covered {{horizontal}} tails {{on top of}} the fuselages. The fins {{were small}} and semi-circular and the fabric covered rudders had scalloped, rounded edges. They had fixed, tailskid undercarriages with mainwheels on a single axle rubber-sprung from a transverse member mounted on V-struts. The forward member of the V joined the forward fuselage just behind the metal cowling and the rear one went to the lower wing forward attachment points.|$|R

50|$|The Wib 313 was {{designed}} for the 1930 Service Technique de l'Aéronautique (S.T.Aé, Technical Department of Aeronautics) single-seat fighter (C.1) programme.

It also moved away from Wibault's tradition of angular wing plans and <b>empennages</b> and flat sided fuselages. It {{was designed}} and constructed by Avions Michel Wibault, though the company merged with Chantiers de Saint-Nazaire, forming Chantiers Aéronautiques Wibault-Penhoët before the Wib 313 was completed.|$|R
50|$|This {{particular}} design, one {{of several}} developed by the Kaiserliche Werften, was a conventional, two-bay biplane with wings of unequal span.

It {{is possible that the}} design was related to one group of seaplane trainers built at Kaiserliche Werft Kiel (No 463-466) and also to that of an armed reconnaissance seaplane (No 947) later built at Wilhelmshaven. However, the rear fuselages and <b>empennages</b> of No 461 and 462 differed significantly from the machines built at Kiel.|$|R

40|$|Structures {{subjected}} to dynamic loads, generally show structural damping values which are just slightly capable of reducing oscillations amplitude. In aerospace field, low structural damping, or high oscillations amplitudes, may impact negatively on structural stability and emitted noise.

40|$|Abstract. Use of low {{fidelity}} {{tools in}} designing subscale generic wind tunnel models is usually {{required to get}} first-hand knowledge about general trends of aerodynamic and stability parameters. Most of such tools are limited to well-defined conventional aircraft configurations. In the present work, aerodynamic and stability characteristics of a winged hybrid airship is explored at low subsonic speed by using Aircraft Digital DATCOM, {{which is based on}} semi-empirical methods for preliminary aircraft geometries. Spheroidal ellipsoidal shaped hull of the airship is modeled in DATCOM along with the geometrical details of wing and <b>empennages.</b> The prediction of zero lift drag coefficient, coefficient of lift and pitching moment is the focus of this paper. Except the drag coefficients, trends of analytical results compare well with experimental data...|$|R
