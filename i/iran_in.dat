5|$|A National Anthem Committee {{was formed}} in 1948, but it had {{difficulty}} finding suitable music and lyrics.

However, the anthem was not officially adopted until August 1954. The National Anthem Committee eventually approved lyrics written by Abu-Al-Asar Hafeez Jullandhuri and the new national anthem was first played properly on Radio Pakistan on August 13, 1954.

The crown was also added {{as a symbol of}} royalty rather than for any particular Qajar monarch. The decree states that the emblem is at once the national, royal, and the state emblem of <b>Iran.</b> <b>In</b> this period the lion was depicted as more masculine and the sun was female. Before this time the sun could be male or female and the lion was represented as a swordless, friendly and subdued seated animal.|$|E

Finally, in fall 2013, the parliament approved a plan to drop 22 million Iranians—the top 30 percent of earners—from the subsidy system instead. Yet, it was reported in 2014 that out of Iran’s population of 77 million, 73.6 million registered to receive the cash hand-outs.|$|E
