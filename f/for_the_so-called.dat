5|$|In 1485 Ivan III {{commissioned}} {{the building of}} the royal residence, Terem Palace, within the Kremlin, with Aloisio da Milano as the architect of the first three floors. He and other Italian architects also contributed to the construction of the Kremlin walls and towers. The small banquet hall of the Russian Tsars, called the Palace of Facets because of its facetted upper story, is the work of two Italians, Marco Ruffo and Pietro Solario, and shows a more Italian style. In 1505, an Italian known in Russia as Aleviz Novyi or Aleviz Fryazin arrived in Moscow. He may have been the Venetian sculptor, Alevisio Lamberti da Montagne. He built 12 churches for Ivan III, including the Cathedral of the Archangel, a building remarkable for the successful blending of Russian tradition, Orthodox requirements and Renaissance style. It is believed that the Cathedral of the Metropolitan Peter in Vysokopetrovsky Monastery, another work of Aleviz Novyi, later served as an inspiration <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>so-called</b> octagon-on-tetragon architectural form in the Moscow Baroque of the late 17th century.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} years after Belgian independence, Antwerp was governed by Catholic-Unionist mayors. Between 1848 and 1921, all mayors were from the Liberal Party (except <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>so-called</b> Meeting-intermezzo between 1863 and 1872). Between 1921 and 1932, the city had a Catholic mayor again: Frans Van Cauwelaert.|$|E

25|$|Plant {{nutrition}} is {{the study}} of the chemical elements that are necessary for plant growth. There are several principles that apply to plant nutrition. Some elements are directly involved in plant metabolism. However, this principle does not account <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>so-called</b> beneficial elements, whose presence, while not required, has clear positive effects on plant growth.|$|E
25|$|Some historians {{consider}} that {{the area where the}} city is located nowadays was not inhabited in the Pre-Columbian era, except in the 15th century, when this valley was set aside for use <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>so-called</b> Flower Wars among the populations of Itzocan, Tepeaca, Huejotzingo, Texmelucan and Tlaxcala, with those soldiers captured being used as sacrifice victims.|$|E

25|$|Edison {{devised a}} circuit where his {{modified}} light bulb effectively replaced the resistor in a DC voltmeter. Edison {{was awarded a}} patent for this invention in 1884.

25|$|These {{expressions}} are <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>so-called</b> mean obliquity, that is, the obliquity {{free from}} short-term variations. Periodic {{motions of the}} Moon and of Earth in its orbit cause much smaller (9.2 arcseconds) short-period (about 18.6 years) oscillations of the rotation axis of Earth, known as nutation, which add a periodic component to Earth's obliquity. The true or instantaneous obliquity includes this nutation.|$|E

The home port of each ship was Trieste. Baron Gautsch carried commuters, {{business}} and leisure travelers and summer guests who wanted to visit the popular seaside resorts of the Adriatic.

25|$|Sir Robert Holmes (ca. 1622 – 18 November 1692) was an English Admiral of the Restoration Navy. He {{took part}} {{in the second and third}} Anglo-Dutch wars, both of which he is, by some, {{credited}} with having started. He was made governor of the Isle of Wight, where he is buried in Yarmouth parish church. Holmes is chiefly remembered for his exploits on the cruise to Guinea (1664) for the Royal African Company, and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>so-called</b> Holmes's Bonfire of 1666. He is regarded as an archetypal figure both of the quarrelsome restoration officer and of the coming into being of the British professional naval officer.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the proposals of Motor Theory and Direct Realism about the relation between phonological features and articulatory gestures, Kenneth N. Stevens proposed another kind of relation: between phonological features and auditory properties. According to this view, listeners are inspecting the incoming signal <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>so-called</b> acoustic landmarks which are particular events in the spectrum carrying information about gestures which produced them. Since these gestures are limited by the capacities of humans' articulators and listeners are sensitive to their auditory correlates, the lack of invariance simply {{does not exist in}} this model. The acoustic properties of the landmarks constitute the basis for establishing the distinctive features. Bundles of them uniquely specify phonetic segments (phonemes, syllables, words).|$|E

25|$|On December 22, 2014, Ling Jihua, {{former senior}} aide to {{paramount}} leader Hu Jintao {{and a political}} star whose ambitions were quashed by the untimely death of his Ferrari-driving son, also fell under the anti-graft dragnet. Ling was serving {{as the head of}} the party's United Front Work Department at the time, and also was Vice-Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), a legislative advisory body. Ling hailed from the prominent Linghu political family from Pinglu County, Shanxi. Several of his relatives were reported as having been investigated beginning in the third quarter of 2014, in what seemed to be another 'encirclement campaign' similar to what was happening with Zhou Yongkang. It was later alleged that Ling served as somewhat of a ringleader <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>so-called</b> Xishan Society, a secret society-like network of high officials from Shanxi province.|$|E
25|$|The first Restoration {{was quite}} mild {{and the only}} {{significant}} penalty Lays suffered was his dismissal from the former Chapelle Impériale with a resulting loss of income. When Napoleon returned to power <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>so-called</b> Hundred Days, Lays was inevitably reinstated in his post and he enthusiastically participated in the Te Deum of thanks. The second Restoration of the Bourbons was more serious for Lays. At the express wish of Louis XVIII he was again expelled – this time for good – from the new Chapelle Royale, but in return, in 1816, he was named professor of declamatory singing at the École royale de Musique et de Déclamation, which had replaced the Conservatoire. The salary was indispensable to Lays because his gout meant {{he was no longer}} able to appear at the Opéra as regularly as he had done, leading to a drastic reduction in extra income.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 20thcentury, English J. C. Edward and Norwegian S.

500|$|From the 19th century, Sappho {{began to}} be {{regarded}} as a role model for campaigners for women's rights, beginning with works such as Caroline Norton's The Picture of Sappho. [...] Later in that century, she would become a model <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>so-called</b> New Woman – independent and educated women who desired social and sexual autonomy – and by the 1960s, the feminist Sappho was – along with the hypersexual, often but not exclusively lesbian Sappho – one of the two most important cultural perceptions of Sappho.|$|E
