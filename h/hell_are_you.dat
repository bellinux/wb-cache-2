His team mates, however, had anticipated Walters' expectations and were hidden in the shower room. Ian Chappell, the Aussie skipper, {{was alone in the}} room, hunched over a newspaper crossword. Chappell looked up as Walters entered, well ahead of his fellow batsmen. 'What the <b>hell</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> doing back here? I told you not to get out tonight'...|$|E

2500|$|In March 2006, Bonhams Auction House in London {{announced}} that it would auction Borg's Wimbledon trophies and two of his winning rackets on 21 June 2006. Several players then called Borg in an attempt to make him reconsider, including Jimmy Connors and Andre Agassi who volunteered to buy them to keep them together.

He is a personal friend of Bill Clinton, who was President of the United States during Kaplan's tenure. According to the Media Research Center, Kaplan's friendship, and political affinity, with Clinton affected the way the network covered the Monica Lewinsky scandal: [...] "As the Lewinsky scandal broke, Kaplan leapt into action at CNN with two-hour specials attacking any and all Clinton critics. The programs included Media Madness, which asked 'what the <b>hell</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> people doing' probing Bill Clinton’s sex life?; and Investigating the Investigator, which described Ken Starr as 'suspect' over his 'religious and Republican roots.'" [...] Conservative commentator John Fund wrote that [...] "During Mr. Kaplan's CNN tenure, there were no obvious examples of his coming to Mr. Clinton's aid," [...] but that CNN's [...] "executives create a perception problem when they hobnob with politicians." ...|$|E
5000|$|On July 10, 1995, Hugh Grant {{appeared}} in {{public for the}} first time after his arrest on lewd conduct charges the previous month.

[...] In response, Grant told Leno, [...] "I think you know in life what's {{a good thing to do}} and what's a bad thing, and I did a bad thing...and there you have it." [...] The appearance was the first episode in which Leno beat CBS rival David Letterman.|$|R
25|$|Leno's Tonight Show started rocky; {{prior to}} Letterman's move, NBC {{considered}} matching CBS's offer to allow Letterman {{to take over}} from Leno. Letterman beat Leno {{for nearly two years}} until August 1995, when Leno welcomed British actor Hugh Grant, who had recently been arrested for soliciting a prostitute ("What the <b>hell</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> thinking?", Leno asked, to applause), to a previously-booked appearance on Tonight. From that point on, Letterman slipped below Leno in the ratings, and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno remained number one for the rest of its run.|$|R
500|$|The arrest {{occurred}} {{about two}} weeks before the release of Grant's first major studio film, Nine Months, which he was scheduled to promote on several American television shows.

[...] Grant answered, [...] "I think you know in life what's {{a good thing to do}} and what's a bad thing, and I did a bad thing. And there you have it." ...|$|R
2500|$|In Slate magazine, Hitchens {{pondered the}} notion that, instead of curing {{antisemitism}} {{through the creation}} of a Jewish state, [...] "Zionism has only replaced and repositioned" [...] it, saying: [...] "there are three groups of 6 million Jews. The first 6 million live in what the Zionist movement used to call Palestine. The second 6 million live in the United States. The third 6 million are distributed mainly among Russia, France, Britain, and Argentina. Only the first group lives daily in range of missiles that can be (and are) launched by people who hate Jews." [...] Hitchens argued that instead of supporting Zionism, Jews should help [...] "secularise and reform their own societies", believing that unless one is religious, [...] "what the <b>hell</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> doing in the greater Jerusalem area in the first place?" [...] Indeed, Hitchens claimed that the only justification for Zionism given by Jews is a religious one.|$|E

500|$|Series lead Noah Wyle {{received}} several phone calls {{after the first}} season finale aired. The number one question was [...] "What the <b>hell</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> doing getting on that spaceship?" [...] He said that they [...] "wrote themselves into a corner". Moon Bloodgood, who plays Dr. Anne Glass, says she was sort of daunted but impressed by the writing. Aubuchon added that Tom Mason's capture helped the writer's change the character slightly. He stated: [...] "Tom comes away from that experience feeling used and manipulated. It wasn't the experience [...] He {{thought he was going}} to be having a nice conversation with an extraterrestrial being. It turned out to be worse than that. More than that, I won't say.
