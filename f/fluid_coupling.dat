2500|$|The {{mechanical}} transmissions {{used for}} railroad propulsion {{are generally more}} complex and much more robust than standard-road versions. [...] There is usually a <b>fluid</b> <b>coupling</b> interposed between the engine and gearbox, and the gearbox is often of the epicyclic (planetary) type to permit shifting while under load. [...] Various systems have been devised to minimise the break in transmission during gear changing; e.g., the S.S.S. (synchro-self-shifting) gearbox used by Hudswell Clarke.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the model year, all Eagles carried over the new-for-1980 permanent all-wheel drive system with viscous <b>fluid</b> <b>coupling</b> that protected the suspension or driveline components from wear during dry pavement use. A [...] "Select Drive" [...] option, which allowed the Eagle to run in two-wheel-drive (RWD) mode and be switched to four-wheel-drive via a dashboard switch, was offered as a fuel economy measure at midyear. Select Drive required the vehicle to be stationary when switching between two-wheel and four-wheel-drive.|$|E
2500|$|Unfortunately for loyal Oldsmobile customers, GM {{management}} on Woodward Avenue in Detroit were {{focusing on}} cost savings per vehicle by this time, a philosophy later called [...] "less car for more money" [...] by the 1970s. [...] One drawback of this thinking {{was that the}} 1961 through 1964 Oldsmobiles lost their dependable (but expensive to build) Jetaway Hydramatic transmissions. [...] Replacing those time-tested four speed units was a much cheaper to build three speed unit, the Roto Hydramatic. [...] This transmission had no front <b>fluid</b> <b>coupling</b> at all, and utilized a single [...] "fill-and-dump" [...] coupling to perform double duty as both a <b>fluid</b> <b>coupling</b> in third speed while having a third reaction member, which Olds called an [...] "Accel-O-Rotor," [...] which was actually a small stator, thus giving some limited torque multiplication in first. [...] In theory, the [...] "Accel-O-Rotor" [...] would provide the same multiplication range in first as both {{the first and second}} gears of the four speed unit without all the hardware...and cost. [...] It was also unique at that time, in that second speed was pure mechanical connection from engine to rear end...no <b>fluid</b> <b>coupling</b> involved. [...] The big problem with this unit in the Oldsmobiles (and lower line Pontiacs of the same era) was engine speed would race wildly in first, and then hit a [...] "brick wall" [...] of a very steep RPM decline in second, which was equivalent to third gear in the four speed Jetaway Hydramatic. [...] This unit was very trouble prone and unreliable, and cost a great deal of performance otherwise obtainable from the Rocket. [...] It would linger for only these three years, when it was replaced by the much more reliable, but less efficient, Turbo Hydramatic in 1965. [...] Customer complaints caused many dealers and independent transmission shops to wholesale replace the Roto Hydramatic in these cars with older (or contemporary, from a Pontiac Star Chief or Bonneville) HM315 four speed Hydramatic.|$|E

2500|$|The AMC Eagle's central {{differential}} {{behind its}} TorqueFlite automatic transmission was single-speed (without a low-range option) {{and used a}} viscous <b>fluid</b> <b>coupling</b> for quiet and smooth transfer of power to the axle with the greatest traction, on wet or dry pavement.

50|$|A <b>fluid</b> <b>coupling</b> cannot develop {{output torque}} when the {{input and output}} angular {{velocities}} are identical. Hence a <b>fluid</b> <b>coupling</b> cannot achieve 100 percent power transmission efficiency. Due to slippage that will occur in any <b>fluid</b> <b>coupling</b> under load, some power will always be lost in fluid friction and turbulence, and dissipated as heat.

5000|$|The <b>fluid</b> <b>coupling</b> and torque {{converter}} {{was invented by}} the German engineer Foettinger in the early 1900s.

Following the development of the <b>fluid</b> <b>coupling,</b> Sinclair in turn licensed the <b>fluid</b> <b>coupling,</b> now also known as ‘Fluidrive Coupling’ to many companies including the Chrysler Corporation. Many automobile historians confuse Chrysler’s Fluid Drive with the Corporation’s so-called semi-automatic M5/M6 transmissions, which were marketed under various names as “Simplimatic” (Chrysler), “Tip-Toe Shift” (DeSoto), and “Gyro-Matic” (Dodge).

40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of a perfect [...] <b>fluid</b> sphere <b>coupled</b> to a scalar radiation field. By ensuring a Ricci invariant regularity as a conformally flat spacetime at the central world line we find that the <b>fluid</b> <b>coupled</b> to the scalar field satisfies the equation of state ρ_c+ 3 p_c= constant {{at the center of the}} sphere, where the energy ρ_c density and the pressure p_c do not necessarily contain the scalar field contribution. The fluid can be interpreted as anisotropic and radiant because of the scalar field, but it becomes perfect and non radiative at the center of the sphere.

50|$|In first gear, {{power flow}} {{was through the}} forward {{planetary}} gear assembly (either 1.45:1 or 1.55:1 reduction, depending on the model), then the <b>fluid</b> <b>coupling,</b> followed by the rear gear assembly (2.63:1 reduction) and through the reverse gear assembly (normally locked) to the output shaft. That is, the input torus of the <b>fluid</b> <b>coupling</b> ran at a lower speed than the engine, due to {{the reduction of the}} forward gear assembly.
