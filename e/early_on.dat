5|$|After redevelopment, {{wind shear}} {{continued}} to be a problem, with convection located southwest of the center. <b>Early</b> <b>on</b> August17, a pulse in the monsoon increased thunderstorms and allowed the system to become better organized. The convection became more concentrated and the circulation less exposed. As a result, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Vongfong <b>early</b> <b>on</b> August18, still in the central South China Sea. Around that time, the storm began moving more quickly to the northwest due to a developing ridge to its northeast. Although the JMA estimated peak 10minute sustained winds of only 75km/h (45mph), the JTWC assessed Vongfong as continuing to intensify to peak 1minute winds of 100km/h (65mph), <b>early</b> <b>on</b> August19. By that time, the storm was near Hainan, and at 1240UTC that day, Vongfong made landfall in southern China near Wuchuan, Guangdong. It quickly weakened over land, dissipating <b>early</b> <b>on</b> August20 to the west of Guilin.|$|E
5|$|<b>Early</b> <b>on</b> August11, {{the storm}} {{weakened}} slightly while crossing Florida. It then decelerated {{and reached the}} eastern Gulf of Mexico several hours later. Thereafter, the system began to re-strengthen and became a Category1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale at 1200UTC on August12. Early the next day, the storm attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 90mph (150km/h). It weakened slightly <b>early</b> <b>on</b> August14 and curved northwestward while approaching the coast of Louisiana. At 2100UTC, the storm made landfall near Buras with winds of 85mph (140km/h). Curving northeastward, the hurricane re-emerged into the Gulf of Mexico <b>early</b> <b>on</b> August15. However, around 1700UTC, it made another landfall near Ocean Springs, Mississippi at the same intensity. <b>Early</b> <b>on</b> August16, the system weakened to a tropical storm. It then weakened much quicker and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over Mississippi at 0000UTC on August17. The remnant extratropical cyclone persisted until late the next day, at which time it dissipated over Indiana.|$|E
5|$|However, cooler waters {{eventually}} {{caught up}} to Humberto and it began to weaken once again <b>early</b> <b>on</b> August 31 as it tracked into the north Atlantic. That afternoon, Humberto weakened to a tropical storm as its circulation became embedded into a circulation of a nearby extratropical low in a high-shear environment. It continued to weaken that evening, and <b>early</b> <b>on</b> September 1, the tropical storm was absorbed by the larger system.|$|E

5|$|The 1903 Jamaica {{hurricane}} devastated Martinique, Jamaica, and the Cayman Islands in August1903. The second {{tropical cyclone}} of the season, {{the storm was}} first observed well east of the Windward Islands on August6. The system moved generally west-northwestward and strengthened into a hurricane on August7. It struck Martinique <b>early</b> <b>on</b> August9, shortly before reaching the Caribbean Sea. Later that day, the storm became a major hurricane. <b>Early</b> <b>on</b> August11, it made landfall near Morant Point, Jamaica, with winds of 120mph (195km/h), with would be the hurricane's maximum sustained wind speed. <b>Early</b> <b>on</b> the following day, the storm brushed Grand Cayman at the same intensity. The system weakened before landfall near Playa del Carmen, Quintana Roo, <b>early</b> <b>on</b> August13, with winds of 100mph (155km/h). The system emerging into the Gulf of Mexico <b>early</b> <b>on</b> August14 after weakening while crossing the Yucatán Peninsula, but failed to re-strengthen. Around 00:00UTC on August16, the cyclone made landfall north of Tampico, Tamaulipas, with winds of 80mph (130km/h). The hurricane soon weakened to a tropical storm and dissipated over San Luis Potosí late on August16.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Dalila caused {{flooding}} in western Mexico in late July2007. The seventh tropical cyclone {{and the fourth}} named storm of the 2007 Pacific hurricane season, Dalila developed from a tropical wave located well southwest of Mexico on July22. Initially, northeasterly shear caused the depression to remain disorganized, though by <b>early</b> <b>on</b> July24, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Dalila. During the next twenty-four hours, Dalila strengthened slightly further while tracking steadily northwestward, attaining peak winds of 60mph (95km/h) <b>early</b> <b>on</b> the following day. Shortly thereafter, Dalila either crossed or moved very close to Socorro Island on July25. Due to decreasing sea surface temperatures, the storm slowly began to weaken, after curving west-northwestward. <b>Early</b> <b>on</b> July27, Dalila was downgraded to a tropical depression, several hours before degenerating into a remnant low pressure area.|$|E

5|$|A {{mesoscale}} convective complex, {{or large}} circular area of thunderstorms, {{developed in the}} Ethiopian Highlands of Africa on July28. The complex moved west-southwestward through the continent, waxing and waning until persisting along a tropical wave on August2. The next day, the wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from Guinea. Once over the open Atlantic Ocean, the wave quickly developed and became Tropical Depression Three later that day. The depression moved to the west-northwest and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Alberto <b>early</b> <b>on</b> August 4. Alberto continued to strengthen, but moved to cooler waters late on August 5 and weakened briefly. However, the storm strengthened again <b>early</b> <b>on</b> August 6, and it was upgraded to hurricane status as an eye became visible. The upgrade was accompanied with a brief westward turn. However, Alberto continued {{to move to the}} west-northwest later that day, reaching its first peak intensity of 90mph (150km/h) on August 7.|$|E
5|$|A mid- to upper-level trough {{slowed the}} storm {{almost to a}} halt <b>early</b> <b>on</b> August 23, before a drift to the north-northwest began. The next National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{advisory}} then reported that the eye was becoming more distinct and well-defined. This strengthening trend abated because the storm had churned up the waters over which it was passing, bringing cooler water to the surface {{as a result of}} the slow track. Another inhibiting factor may have been related to the same trough that caused the northward turn, though due to a large anticyclone situated over the hurricane, the weakening effects were not substantial. Despite wind shear, the large and powerful circulation resisted weakening for a time. <b>Early</b> <b>on</b> August 25, the shear and the entrainment of drier air into the hurricane took its toll on Bonnie, giving it a ragged appearance on satellite imagery, and the eye briefly became cloud-filled.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm was first observed by a ship about 835mi (1,345km) northeast of Cayenne, French Guiana, <b>early</b> <b>on</b> August6, according to historic weather maps. However, {{the scarcity of}} observations means that its genesis may have occurred earlier than this time and been undetected operationally. With initial winds of 60mph (95km/h), the system moved generally west-northwestward and strengthened into Category1 hurricane on the modern day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale about 24hours later. The first indication of the storm {{to the east of}} Barbados was on August8 via telegraph reports. <b>Early</b> <b>on</b> August9, the cyclone struck Martinique as either a strong Category1 or a weak Category2 hurricane. The storm entered the Caribbean Sea shortly thereafter. Around 12:00UTC, the cyclone intensified into a Category3 hurricane, becoming the first major hurricane in the Atlantic basin since the second storm of 1900 and the first in the Caribbean Sea since the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{developed into}} a tropical depression near Tobago on August7. The system then passed through the Windward Islands just south of Carriacou and Petite Martinique. Upon entering the Caribbean Sea <b>early</b> <b>on</b> August8, the tropical depression strengthened into a tropical storm. On August9, the storm strengthened to {{the equivalent of a}} Category1 hurricane, while positioned south of Dominican Republic. The next day, the hurricane peaked with winds of 90mph (150km/h). After striking the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti, the cyclone began weakening and fell to tropical storm intensity on August12. By midday on the following day, the storm made landfall near Cienfuegos, Cuba. Upon emerging into the Straits of Florida, the storm began to re-strengthen. <b>Early</b> <b>on</b> August13, it struck Big Pine Key, Florida, as a strong tropical storm. Weakening slowly while moving north-northwestward, the system made another landfall near St. George Island. After moving inland, the tropical storm slowly deteriorated, falling to tropical depression intensity on August15 and dissipating over West Virginia on August17.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged from}} the African coast with a closed circulation on August 3. It tracked westward across the tropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean and broke into two distinct parts, the northern portion eventually became Hurricane Alberto. The southern portion continued to track westward into the Caribbean Sea, while producing little or no deep convection. The wave reached Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula on August 12, and only then did deep convection redevelop, mostly due to diurnal heating. The wave emerged over the Bay of Campeche <b>early</b> <b>on</b> August 13 as a large area of low pressure. The wave was upgraded to Tropical Depression Five later that day, based on satellite intensity estimates and an observation from an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft. Six hours after developing, the depression was forecast to strengthen into a hurricane <b>early</b> <b>on</b> August 16 due to the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and little wind shear to inhibit development.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the western coast of Africa on September 1. An {{area of low pressure}} {{associated with the}} wave moved slowly westward, and its convection initially appeared to become better organized. On September 3, as it passed to the south of the Cape Verde islands, organization within the system degraded, though convection increased the next day. The system gradually became better organized, and Dvorak classifications began <b>early</b> <b>on</b> September 5. Based on the development of a closed surface circulation, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen <b>early</b> <b>on</b> September 6. Hours later, it intensified into Tropical Storm Isabel, though operationally the National Hurricane Center did not begin issuing advisories until 13hours after it first developed.|$|E
5|$|A {{weakening}} trend soon occurred, with it weakening to a Category1 hurricane <b>early</b> <b>on</b> September15.
