50|$|In {{order to}} extract more speed, and endow {{the boat with}} greater high speed stability, in both pitch and yaw, K7 was subtly {{modified}} {{in the second half}} of the 1950s to incorporate more effective streamlining with a blown Perspex cockpit canopy and fluting to the lower part of the main hull. In 1958, a small wedge shaped tail <b>fin,</b> <b>housing</b> an arrester parachute, modified sponson fairings, that gave a significant reduction in forward aerodynamic lift, and a fixed hydrodynamic stabilising fin, attached to the transom to aid directional stability, and exert a marginal down-force on the nose were incorporated into the design to increase the safe operating envelope of the hydroplane. Thus she reached 225 mph in 1956, where an unprecedented peak speed of 286.78 mph was achieved on one run, 239 mph in 1957, 248 mph in 1958 and 260 mph in 1959.|$|E

The CEOHP design employed copper tubes: Two sets of capillary tubes with an inner diameter of 0. 002 m, an evaporator length of 0. 05 and a condenser length of 0. 16 m and each of which has six meandering turns. The evaporator section was embraced in the aluminum housing and attached to the thermal pad of Pentium 4 CPU, model SL 6 PB, 2. 26 GHZ. While the condenser section was embraced in the cooling <b>fin</b> <b>housing</b> and cooled by forced convection. R 134 a was used as the working fluid with filling ratio of 50 %. In the experiment, the CPU chip with a power of 58 W was 70 Â°C. Fan speed of 2000 and 4000 rpm. It was found that, if fan speed increases the cooling performance increases.

40|$|Investigation of {{the heat}} {{transfer}} by conduction and convection through a <b>finned</b> <b>housing</b> of an electric motor rated 373 W operated in the drive unit of a vacuum pump was carried out. As the speed is changed, so is the velocity of air flow, and consequently, the coefficient of heat transfer across the housing surface is changed too. To predict {{the values of the}} average heat transfer coefficient and to determine the heat flow that was dissipated at variable motor speed is a complex task, for which no reliable tools {{can be found in the}} literature. Using finite element approximation, the heat transfer was numerically simulated and the temperature distribution on the housing surface was determined. In order to validate the simulation model, an experimental set-up was assembled, including the vacuum pump complete with its driving unit, that is, electrical motor and frequency converter, and FLIR SC 7600 thermovision camera. Using the validated simulation model, the heat flux transferred through the housing to the environment and the share of heat dissipation in the power consumed by the vacuum pump drive was determined. The combination of numerical simulation and thermographic measurements is an effective tool...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Overreliance on {{petroleum}} products and environmental pollution from combustion emissions produced by automobiles {{has led to}} extensive research on hybrid electric vehicles, electric vehicles and their components. A key component in these vehicles is the electric motor, used for traction as well as powering other appliances like the compressor. Overheating in electrical motors results in detrimental effects such as degradation of the insulation materials, magnet demagnetization, increase in Joule losses and decreased motor efficiency and lifetime. Hence, {{it is important to}} find ways of optimizing performance and reliability of electric motors through effective cooling and consequently reduce operating and maintenance costs. This study describes 3 D CFD simulations performed on a totally enclosed air over fan cooled brushless D. C. motor to identify the temperatures of the critical components of the motor, and the effect of varying thermal parameters of these temperatures. The energy sources are obtained from electromagnetic losses computed using MAXWELL, a commercial FEA software and bearing losses obtained through numerical methods developed by the authors. A finned casing is used as the heat sink and the effect of varying the fin geometry on the cooling performance is examined using three heat sink designs. The results show that the highest temperature occurs at the end windings and that this temperature can be reduced by up to 15 % by introduction of a suitable <b>finned</b> <b>housing.</b> These results show that CFD can be effectively used to optimize the cooling performance of electric motors. Experimental tests are undergoing in order to validate the CFD results. ...|$|R

The house was located on Girdle Road, Kenny Hill, and some {{described it as}} resembling “a startled tropical bird”. The structure was made of timber and brickwork masonry, and sported a pitched roof which harkened back to Malaya’s pre-war colonial traditions. Yet the house’s unusual geometry and its ‘V’-shaped columns placed it firmly within the modernist tradition.In 1961, Loo designed another ‘bungalow’, the Brunei house, the Sultan of Brunei gave the commission to Booty, Edwards and Partners with the stipulation that it be finished within fifty-five days. It cost $600,000 and was awarded the RIBA Bronze medal.

40|$|Advancements in {{electronics}} {{have created}} the need for improved cooling standards. The AECM standard, created to replace the antiquated ARINC 600 specification for aircraft, draws inspiration from a cooling specification known as VITA 48. 2. The ARINC standard is in early stages of development and this project researches the feasibility of using air as a convective fluid instead of a liquid, the fluid used in the VITA specification. A performance factor calculated from {{the ratio of the}} heat dissipated by convective heat exchanger plates over the power used to cause forced convective flow over said plates helps to quantify the effectiveness of various cooling scenarios. Design development of the heat exchangers resulted in a plan to manufacture and test six different heat exchanger configurations. Five of these used various assortments of porous foam aluminum; the sixth used a more conventional <b>finned</b> design. To <b>house</b> and test the effectiveness of these configurations a testing platform was created to control and measure appropriate testing values. Before each configuration was tested, the setup was sealed to prevent leaks and insulated to minimize heat transfer sources beyond the effects of the controlled and measured convective air. Notable results include a 10 ppi, 8 % density porous aluminum foam heat exchanger which resulted in both the largest pressure drop, 2. 7 inches of water and heat dissipated at 301 watts at a flow rate of 72 CFM. The performance factor of this plate was the lowest at 13 [Watts/Watts]. Conversely, the largest performance factor at similar flow rate was seen in the finned plate design as 58 [Watts/Watts] at 71 CFM. However, its heat transfer for this flow rate was 167 Watts. Test results and analysis for each prototype is given within the report. A general plot of the results provides a valuable selection tool for choosing an appropriate starting design point to develop AECM air cooling for Boeing. The heat dissipation seen from the air cooled heat exchanger plates is competitive with the liquid cooled module plates and deserves further investigation. The added benefits of natural convection and the weight savings of air cooling further endorse this conclusion...|$|R
