40|$|We {{report the}} {{emergence}} of an influenza virus A/H 3 N 2 -E 119 V neuraminidase variant from an elderly patient with renal dys-function who received a suboptimal dose of oseltamivir prophylaxis. In neuraminidase inhibition assays, the E 119 V variant showed a 413 -fold increase in the 50 % inhibitory oseltamivir concentration and grew at titers comparable to those of the wild type in vitro. Two neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) have been licensed inmany countries for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes, in-cluding the oral drug oseltamivir, which is the most widely pre-scribed NAI, and the inhaled compound zanamivir (1). To date, most cases of NAI-resistant influenza virus A/H 3 N 2 infections have been observed in immunocompromised patients treated with oseltamivir for extended periods of time (2). Herein, we re-port the emergence and in vitro characterization of an oseltamivir-resistant influenza virus A/H 3 N 2 variant harboring the frame-work <b>E</b> 119 V <b>neuraminidase</b> (<b>NA)</b> mutation in an elderly patient during antiviral prophylaxis...|$|R
40|$|We have {{identified}} a virus, B/Perth/ 211 / 2001, with a spontaneous mutation, D 197 <b>E</b> in the <b>neuraminidase</b> (<b>NA),</b> which confers cross-resistance to all NA inhibitors. We analyzed enzyme properties of the D 197 and E 197 NAs and compared these to a D 197 N NA, known to arise after oseltamivir treatment. Zanamivir and peramivir bound slowly to the wild type NA, but binding of oseltamivir was more rapid. The D 197 E/N mutations resulted in faster binding of all three inhibitors. Analysis of the crystal structures of D 197 and E 197 NAs with and without inhibitors showed that the D 197 E mutation compromised the interaction of neighboring R 150 with the N-acetyl group, common to the substrate sialic acid and all NA inhibitors. Although rotation of the E 275 in the NA active site occurs upon binding peramivir in both the D 197 and E 197 NAs, this does not occur upon binding oseltamivir in the E 197 NA. Lack of the E 275 rotation would also account {{for the loss of}} slow binding and the partial resistance of influenza B wild type NAs to oseltamivir...|$|R
40|$|The Newcastle disease virus (NDV) hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein mediates {{attachment}} to cellular receptors. The fusion (F) protein promotes viral entry and spread. However, fusion {{is dependent on}} a virus-specific interaction between the two proteins that can be detected at the cell surface by a coimmunoprecipitation assay. A point mutation of I 175 <b>E</b> in the <b>neuraminidase</b> (<b>NA)</b> active site converts the HN of the Australia-Victoria isolate of the virus to a form that can interact with the F protein despite negligible receptor recognition and fusion-promoting activities. Thus, I 175 E-HN could represent a fusion intermediate in which HN and F are associated and primed {{for the promotion of}} fusion. Both the attachment and fusion-promoting activities of this mutant HN protein can be rescued either by NA activity contributed by another HN protein or by a set of four substitutions at the dimer interface. These substitutions were identified by the evaluation of chimeras composed of segments from HN proteins derived from two different NDV strains. These findings suggest that the I 175 E substitution converts HN to an F-interactive form, but it is one for which receptor binding is still required for fusion promotion. The data also indicate that the integrity of the HN dimer interface is critical to its receptor recognition activity...|$|R
40|$|Influenza virions bud {{preferentially}} {{from the}} apical plasma membrane of infected epithelial cells, by enveloping viral nucleocapsids {{located in the}} cytosol with its viral integral membrane proteins, i. <b>e.,</b> hemagglutinin (HA), <b>neuraminidase</b> (<b>NA),</b> and M 2 proteins, located at the plasma membrane. Because individually expressed HA, NA, and M 2 proteins are targeted to the apical surface of the cell, guided by apical sorting signals in their transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains, it has been proposed that the polarized budding of influenza virions depends on the interaction of nucleocapsids and matrix proteins with the cytoplasmic domains of HA, NA, and/or M 2 proteins. Since HA is the major protein component of the viral envelope, its polarized surface delivery may be a major force that drives polarized viral budding. We investigated this hypothesis by infecting MDCK cells with a transfectant influenza virus carrying a mutant form of HA (C 560 Y) with a basolateral sorting signal in its cytoplasmic domain. C 560 Y HA was expressed nonpolarly {{on the surface of}} infected MDCK cells. Interestingly, viral budding remained apical in C 560 Y virus-infected cells, and so did the location of NP and M 1 proteins at late times of infection. These results are consistent with a model in which apical viral budding is a shared function of various viral components rather than a role of the major viral envelope glycoprotein HA...|$|R
