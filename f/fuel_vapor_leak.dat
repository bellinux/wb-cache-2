5000|$|Carburetor units may not {{effectively}} {{deal with}} <b>fuel</b> <b>vapor</b> {{being delivered to}} the float chamber. Most designs incorporate a pressure balance duct linking {{the top of the}} float bowl with either the intake to the carburetor or the outside air. Even if the pump can handle <b>vapor</b> locks effectively, <b>fuel</b> <b>vapor</b> entering the float bowl has to be vented. If this is done via the intake system, the mixture is, in effect, enriched, creating a mixture control and pollution issue. If it is done by venting to the outside, the result is direct hydrocarbon pollution and an effective loss of fuel efficiency and possibly a fuel odor problem. For this reason, some fuel delivery systems allow <b>fuel</b> <b>vapor</b> to be returned to the fuel tank to be condensed back to the liquid phase, or using an active carbon filled canister where <b>fuel</b> <b>vapor</b> is absorbed. This is usually implemented by removing <b>fuel</b> <b>vapor</b> from the <b>fuel</b> line near the engine rather than from the float bowl. Such a system may also divert excess fuel pressure from the pump back to the tank.|$|R

50|$|Problem- An ORVR carbon-filled {{canister}} (installed {{on modern}} vehicles) {{is designed to}} capture <b>fuel</b> <b>vapors</b> displaced while refueling, and then to inject them into the intake manifold later on, {{so that they are}} burned along with the regular fuel, during normal engine operation. However, a Stage II vapor recovery system, installed on refuling gas station pumps, uses a vacuum to prevent <b>fuel</b> <b>vapors</b> from being released into the atmosphere. The design of the fill pipe seal in ORVR systems, prevents <b>fuel</b> <b>vapors</b> from entering the fuel tank fill pipe. That frustrates the purpose of the Stage II nozzle, which was designed to vacuum away any <b>fuel</b> <b>vapors</b> that come up that fill pipe, during the refuelling process. If the car's own vapor recovery system is working properly, then the Stage II nozzle will only be vacuuming normal fresh air and depositing that into the gas station's underground fuel storage tanks. That ends up causing evaporation of <b>fuel</b> <b>vapors</b> into the atmosphere, because too much pressure builds up in those fuel storage tanks. When that pressure becomes too great, it is released into the atmosphere via a pressure relief pipe.|$|R

Slip between the condensed and gas phases is shown to cause <b>fuel</b> <b>vapor</b> mass fraction fluctuations upstream of the reaction zone. A resulting oscillating heat release can drive the pressure fluctuations, depending on the phase difference between them. This generates an acoustic instability.

40|$|Bridge-mixing was {{proposed}} earlier {{to explain why}} different combustibles might be ignited simultaneously during flashover. Different <b>fuel</b> <b>vapors</b> gasified from those combustibles were ignited by thermal radiation first. Thermal feedback from flames above the combustibles would then ignite the solid. This point is further studied in this article by bench-scale tests with a cone calorimeter. Sample cubes of two materials with different ignition temperatures were tested at a high thermal radiative heat flux of 70 kWm- 2. Materials selected are polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The two sample cubes {{were placed on the}} cone tray at different separation distances. In this way, different mixing of gasified <b>fuel</b> <b>vapors</b> released from the plastics can be achieved. Those two combustibles were found be ignited simultaneously at shorter separation distances. This might explain why combustible items of different ignition temperatures appear to be ignited at roughly the same time during flashover for some scenarios. On the basis of this study, the mixing of gasified <b>fuel</b> <b>vapors</b> from different combustibles by the fire-induced airflow is a key factor in igniting each item.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the fuel droplet vaporization process in engine cycles, measurements of the local concentration of <b>fuel</b> <b>vapor</b> in high temperature and pressure environments are required. To achieve this, planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) of well-characterized tracer molecules are used to track the local <b>fuel</b> <b>vapor</b> concentration. For many tracer molecules of interest, there is a strong quenching effect of local oxygen. This work aims to control and determine the quenching environment to allow quantitative measurements. For this purpose, a fluid system is designed to vary the amount of dissolved oxygen within the fuel tracer using a pressurized storage vessel. To verify the removal of dissolved oxygen from the tracer molecules, laser-induced measurements of the phosphorescence lifetime of the 2 ̆ 7 oxygen-free 2 ̆ 7 <b>fuel</b> <b>vapor</b> in nitrogen bath gas is made using the fourth harmonic output of an Nd:YAG laser. A fast-time-gated ICCD camera is used to take images and determine both the fluorescence and phosphorescence lifetimes with this laser excitation.
