500|$|The band {{cancelled}} its scheduled recording sessions as {{a result}} of Berry's departure. [...] "Without Bill it was different, confusing", Mills later said. [...] "We didn't <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. We couldn't rehearse without a drummer." [...] The remaining members of R.E.M. resumed work on the album in February 1998 at Toast Studios in San Francisco. The band ended its decade-long collaboration with Scott Litt and hired Pat McCarthy to produce the record. Nigel Godrich was taken on as assistant producer, and drafted in Screaming Trees member Barrett Martin and Beck's touring drummer Joey Waronker. The recording process was plagued with tension, and the group came close to disbanding. Bertis Downs called an emergency meeting where the band members sorted out their problems and agreed to continue as a group. Led off by the single [...] "Daysleeper", Up (1998) debuted in the top ten in the US and UK. However, the album was a relative failure, selling 900,000 copies in the US by mid-1999 and eventually selling just over two million copies worldwide. While R.E.M.'s American sales were declining, the group's commercial base was shifting to the UK, where more R.E.M. records were sold per capita than any other country and the band's singles regularly entered the Top 20.|$|E
2500|$|Shonda Rhimes noted Washington's {{commitment}} to his role, revealing that he learns all his surgeries before he performs them on television. [...] "I {{think if he}} stopped at an accident on the street, he'd <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. He has pulled shifts at hospitals where he follows the surgeons around for 48 hours". At {{the beginning of the}} series, Burke is one of the three African american characters, along with Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) and Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.).|$|E
2500|$|Dennett {{also has}} a {{response}} to the [...] "Mary the color scientist" [...] thought experiment. He argues that Mary would not, in fact, learn something new if she stepped out of her black and white room to see the color red. Dennett asserts that if she already truly knew [...] "everything about color", that knowledge would include a deep understanding of why and how human neurology causes us to sense the [...] "quale" [...] of color. Mary would therefore already <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> expect of seeing red, before ever leaving the room. Dennett argues that the misleading aspect of the story is that Mary is supposed to not merely be knowledgeable about color but to actually know all the physical facts about it, which would be a knowledge so deep that it exceeds what can be imagined, and twists our intuitions.|$|E

60|$|If {{the boys}} were excited, the girls and ladies were more so. Nobody <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do, and each minute added to the general anxiety.|$|R
2500|$|Throughout her career, Vélez's onscreen {{persona of}} a hot tempered, lusty [...] "wild" [...] woman was closely tied to her off screen personality. The press often {{referred}} to her by such names as [...] "The Mexican Spitfire", [...] "The Mexican It girl" [...] and [...] "The Mexican Kitten". Vélez consciously chose to promote her [...] "Whoopee Lupe" [...] persona but dismissed {{the idea that she}} was wild. In an interview she said: [...] "What I attribute my success?, I think, simply, because I'm different. I'm not beautiful, but I have beautiful eyes and <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do with them. Although the public thinks that I'm a very wild girl. Actually I'm not. I'm just me, Lupe Vélez, simple and natural Lupe. If I'm happy, I dance and sing and acted like a child. And if something irritates me, I cry and sob. Someone called that 'personality.' The Personality is nothing more than behave with others as you really are. If I tried to look and act like Norma Talmadge, the great dramatic actress, or like Corinne Griffith, the aristocrat of the movies, or like Mary Pickford, the sweet and gentle Mary, I would be nothing more than an imitation. I just want to be myself: Lupe Velez." ...|$|E

6000|$|The summons was not needed. All the {{men were}} present, and each <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do in the circumstances. But what avails the {{strength}} and capacity of man when his weapon is useless? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] grumbled Arnold Baxter. [...] "But I don't <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do," [...] {{and the man}} {{scratched}} his head in perplexity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I shouldn't go {{back home}} until your father and your uncle return," [...] said the senator's son. [...] "Then, if you are arrested, they'll <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do." ...|$|E
6000|$|It must be {{confessed that}} the boys did not <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. Should they venture on the river again, or carry the outfit to the {{beginning}} of Firefly Lake? ...|$|E
60|$|The two {{brothers}} {{looked at each}} other. Neither <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. Paul finally made a sign to withdraw, and they turned and rode down the river trail to the belt of cottonwoods.|$|R
60|$|Speech was not {{required}} in the circumstances. Ned <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do, and Joe {{knew that he had}} been sent to relieve him. He therefore delivered the branch to Ned, and at once sprang out on the escape, where he encountered David Clazie.|$|R
50|$|Though {{research}} {{has gone into}} the effects of sleep deprivation nobody <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> expect. Hallucinations and odd behaviour were evident quite quickly in some contestants. Numerous contestants suffered from both hypnagogia and hypnopompia (both essentially dreaming while awake, normally just prior to or after sleep).|$|R
60|$|Lothaw did not <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. She however soothed and {{sustained}} his agitated frame and sealed with an embrace his speechless form. The General approached and coughed slightly with gentlemanly tact.|$|E

60|$|By this time, {{the snakes}} had wiggled several feet {{closer to the}} shelter. Evidently, it was their den and, while they wished to get in, they did not <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do about the intruders.|$|E
60|$|Running swiftly, Dick {{reached the}} other car and hopped up to the chauffeur's seat. He had watched the driver operate the car and <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. He soon had the engine running and then he threw in the speed clutch just as Hellig lurched up.|$|R
60|$|Once safe, {{the boys}} placed the {{stranger}} {{on the grass}} and started to work over him. He was unconscious, and had evidently swallowed considerable water. Fortunately, the lads had taken lessons in how to resuscitate a person who had been close to drowning, so they <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do.|$|R
60|$|The Rover {{boys were}} {{so used to}} {{traveling}} and to camping out that they <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> take along. The other lads were also well informed, because of the military encampments {{in which they had}} participated. They carried only what was necessary, so that their steeds might not be too heavily burdened.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will run}} over {{to the office and}} find out. You see I haven't been on the force very long, and don't <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do when the work will keep me so long away." ...|$|E
60|$|The old ranchman {{had seen}} strenuous {{times in his}} younger days, {{and he seemed to}} <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. He divided the boys into two groups, placing them {{on either side of the}} winding and rocky road.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] {{answered}} the victorious subordinate, [...] "it {{is a great}} thing to be <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do in an emergency. When in doubt whether to attack or retreat I never hesitate a moment--I toss us a copper." ...|$|E

6000|$|Then Jock {{had time}} to {{question}} whether Barbara ought {{to go on with}} him and Armine to the door, but there was a sound in her [...] "Let me! I must!"

60|$|Both of {{the youths}} had been camping so often that they <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. The fire was stirred up, and fresh wood put on, and they {{prepared}} a couple of cups of coffee, and broiled two squirrels. They had bread and crackers, and a little cheese, and thus made quite a good breakfast.|$|R
6000|$|Zulime laughed merrily {{over the}} wreck of our self-sacrificing program when we were alone. [...] "Well, we'll <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do next time. All {{we need to do}} is to furnish dominoes and tables, our guests will do the rest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look you," [...] {{said the}} Missourian, after a scrutinizing pause, [...] "you are a queer sort of chap. Don't <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> make of you. Upon the whole though, you {{somewhat}} {{remind me of}} the last boy I had on my place." ...|$|E
60|$|During my {{conversation}} with the gentleman I had {{made up my mind}} to tell him what I knew of Captain Hannock's plot. I felt sure that he would <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. Moreover, being a lawyer, he could perhaps take steps to nip the thing in the bud.|$|E
5000|$|I {{remember}} that {{his last words}} were that he was entirely satisfied with everything, and [...] "The Lord's will be done." [...] Thus he died, very quietly and resigned. I never saw a braver man than he. He was always cool under fire and <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do, and his men were devoted to him.|$|R

60|$|When she {{had gone}} he {{explained}} to Philip that it made him uneasy {{if he was not}} certain that Mrs. Foster was within earshot; she <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do with him if anything happened.
