5|$|Although calcium <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{group as}} {{magnesium}} and organomagnesium compounds are very commonly used throughout chemistry, organocalcium compounds are not similarly widespread {{because they are}} more difficult to make and more reactive, although they have recently been investigated as possible catalysts. Organocalcium compounds tend to be more similar to organoytterbium compounds due to the similar ionic radii of Yb2+ (102pm) and Ca2+ (100pm). Most of these compounds can only be prepared at low temperatures; bulky ligands tend to favor stability. For example, calcium dicyclopentadienyl, Ca(C5H5)2, must be made by directly reacting calcium metal with mercurocene or cyclopentadiene itself; replacing the C5H5 ligand with the bulkier C5(CH3)5 ligand on the other hand increases the compound's solubility, volatility, and kinetic stability.|$|E

5|$|Cucurbita (Latin for gourd) is a genus of {{herbaceous}} vines in {{the gourd}} family, Cucurbitaceae, {{also known as}} cucurbits, native to the Andes and Mesoamerica. Five species are grown worldwide for their edible fruit, variously known as squash, pumpkin, or gourd depending on species, variety, and local parlance, and for their seeds. Other kinds of gourd, also called bottle-gourds, are native to Africa and belong to the genus Lagenaria, which <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> family and subfamily as Cucurbita but in a different tribe. These other gourds are used as utensils or vessels, and their young fruits are eaten much like those of Cucurbita species.|$|E
5|$|Dalyngrigge's licence from Richard II {{permitted}} him to refortify his existing manor house, {{but instead}} he chose a fresh site to build a castle on. Construction was completed in one phase, {{and most of the}} castle <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> architectural style. Archaeologist David Thackray has deduced from this that Bodiam Castle was built quickly, probably because of the threat from the French. Stone castles were usually time-consuming and expensive to build, often costing thousands of pounds. Dalyngrigge was Captain of the port of Brest in France from 1386 to 1387, and as a result was probably absent for {{the first years of the}} castle's construction. It replaced the old manor house as Dalyngrigge's main residence and the administrative centre of the manor. It is not recorded when Bodiam Castle was completed, but Thackray suggests that it was before 1392; Dalyngrigge did not have long to spend in the completed castle, as he was dead by 1395.|$|E

NY114 was assigned to its current alignment as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and is known in part as the Sag Harbor Turnpike. The bridge carrying NY114 between Sag Harbor and North Haven is an arched bridge that serves as a village landmark. In 1999, residents successfully fought state proposals to replace it with a girder bridge. Instead, the bridge was replaced with a new, wider bridge with ornamental lamps that closely resembles the original and <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> location.|$|E
5|$|Ocepeia is {{from the}} Paleocene of Morocco's Ouled Abdoun Basin, {{although}} its fossils were initially thought to be earliest Ypresian (early Eocene) in age. That age has been revised, {{and now it is}} known that O. daouiensis comes from the same bone bed that is dated to the Selandian age of the Paleocene (59-60 MYA), which also yields Eritherium, Abdounodus, and Lahimia. O. grandis is slightly younger (more recent) in age, occurring in the Thanetian bone bed of the same area. Its larger size and younger age suggest it <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> evolutionary lineage as O. daouiensis. The area of western Morocco during the late Cretaceous through the Eocene consisted of warm, shallow inland seas, where the ancient Tethys Ocean met the Atlantic Ocean, and during which phosphate deposits and associated fossils accumulated over some 25 million years.|$|E

5|$|The IUCN {{notes that}} {{very little is}} known about the actual status of the great white shark, but as it appears {{uncommon}} compared to other widely distributed species, it is considered vulnerable. It is included in Appendix II of CITES, meaning that international trade in the species requires a permit. As of March 2010, it has also been included in Annex I of the CMS Migratory Sharks MoU, which strives for increased international understanding and coordination for the protection of certain migratory sharks. A February 2010 study by Barbara Block of Stanford University estimated the world population of great white sharks to be lower than 3,500 individuals, making the species more vulnerable to extinction than the tiger, whose population <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> range. According to another study from 2014 by George H.

5|$|The chapel was {{designed}} by Sir Charles Barry, shortly before he designed the Palace of Westminster. It was constructed between 1837 and 1839 out of sandstone, with a slate roof. It is in English neogothic style. The building has seven narrow bays, with buttresses and a lancet in each bay. The west end has a giant moulded archway, with an arched doorway at the ground floor with a window above. On the east end there is a rose window. The corners are square, with pinnacles. The inside of the chapel had galleries on three sides, and a ribbed, vaulted ceiling. The attached two-storey Sunday School <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> style as the chapel, and has a triple-gabled north side, with large arched windows on the first floor.

5|$|All {{copies of}} Hymn {{are found in}} manuscripts of the Historia ecclesiastica or its {{translation}}, where they serve as either a gloss to Bede's Latin translation of the Old English poem, or, {{in the case of}} the Old English version, a replacement for Bede's translation in the main text of the History. Despite this close connection with Bede's work, the Hymn does not appear to have been transmitted with the Historia ecclesiastica regularly until relatively late in its textual history. Scribes other than those responsible for the main text often copy the vernacular text of the Hymn in manuscripts of the Latin Historia. In three cases, Oxford, Bodleian Library, Laud Misc. 243, Oxford, Bodleian Library, Hatton 43, and Winchester, Cathedral I, the poem is copied by scribes working a quarter-century or more after the main text was first set down. Even when the poem <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> hand as the manuscript's main text, there is little evidence to suggest that it was copied from the same exemplar as the Latin Historia: nearly identical versions of the Old English poem are found in manuscripts belonging to different recensions of the Latin text; closely related copies of the Latin Historia sometimes contain very different versions of the Old English poem. With the exception of the Old English translation, no single recension of the Historia ecclesiastica is characterised by the presence of a particular recension of the vernacular poem.|$|E

5|$|As well {{as being}} added, forces can also be {{resolved}} into independent components {{at right angles to}} each other. A horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces, one pointing north, and one pointing east. Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force. Resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions. This is because, for orthogonal components, the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors. Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> direction as one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component. Orthogonal force vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two.|$|E
5|$|For most viruses with RNA genomes {{and some}} with {{single-stranded}} DNA genomes, the single strands {{are said to}} be either positive-sense (called the plus-strand) or negative-sense (called the minus-strand), depending on if they are complementary to the viral messenger RNA (mRNA). Positive-sense viral RNA <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately translated by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase before translation. DNA nomenclature for viruses with single-sense genomic ssDNA is similar to RNA nomenclature, in that the template strand for the viral mRNA is complementary to it (âˆ’), and the coding strand is a copy of it (+). However, several types of ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have genomes that are ambisense in that transcription can occur off both strands in a double-stranded replicative intermediate. Examples include geminiviruses, which are ssDNA plant viruses and arenaviruses, which are ssRNA viruses of animals.|$|E
5|$|Leicester's {{gatehouse}} {{was built}} {{on the north side of}} the base court, replacing an older gatehouse to provide a fashionable entrance from the direction of Coventry. The external design, with its symbolic towers and, originally, battlements, echoes a style popular a century or more before, closely resembling Kirby Muxloe and the Beauchamp gatehouse at Warwick Castle. By contrast the interior, with its contemporary wood panelling, <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> highly contemporary Elizabethan fashion of Leicester's building in the inner court. Leicester's gatehouse is one of the few parts of the castle to remain intact. The stables built by John Dudley in the 1550s also survive and lie along the east side of the base court. The stable block is a large building built mostly in stone, but with a timber-framed, decoratively panelled first storey designed in an anachronistic, vernacular style. Both buildings could have easily been seen from Leicester's building and were therefore on permanent display to visitors. Leciester's intent may have been to create a deliberately anachronistic view across the base court, echoing the older ideals of chivalry and romance alongside the more modern aspects of the redesign of the castle.|$|E
40|$|Greene (1992) {{argued that}} assertions {{of the form}} "None of <b>the</b> A <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> place {{as some of the}} C " are {{difficult}} for subjects to generate and that this phenomenon explains the results of our study of multiply quantified reasoning without having to invoke mental models or deductive reasoning (see Johnson-Laird, Byrne, & Tabossi, 1989). The present article shows, first, that the phenomenon fails to explain most of our principal results; second, that, far from undermining the theory of mental models, it can actually be explained by the theory; and, third, that the best available account of our results is that subjects both reason and rely on mental models to do so. In a study of reasoning with quantifiers such as some, all, and none, we presented evidence that subjects make deductions, not by using formal rules of inference, but by imagining the relevant states of affairs, formulating a putative conclusion from such a mental model, and then searching for alternative models that might refute the conclusion (Johnson-Laird, Byrne, & Tabossi, 1989). We argued that, for example, premises of the form None of <b>the</b> A <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> place as any of the B All of <b>the</b> B <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> place as all of the C readily elicit a valid conclusion: "Therefore, None of <b>the</b> A <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> place as any of the C, " because they yield only one model, <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> As <b>are</b> <b>in</b> one place and the Bs and Cs <b>are</b> all together <b>in</b> another place.
