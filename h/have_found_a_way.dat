500|$|... "Bang Bang" [...] {{received}} a positive reception from critics on its release. Gigwise praised it saying: [...] "The song is Green Day at their punky best. It's far {{more in line}} with the intensity of stuff on Dookie than the ballads on American Idiot". Thomas Smith at NME observed: [...] "Musically, it's classic Green Day; limited power chords used to furious effect, a maelstrom of abrasive punk rock that's aided by Mike Dirnt's rumbling bass and Tré Cool's on-point drumming. On this evidence, Green Day <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to stay relevant." [...] Joseph R. Atilano, of Inquirer.net, concurred and said the song [...] "does not sound 'glossy', 'too clean cut around the edges' nor overly polished". He added that it [...] "sounds aesthetically right," [...] especially for those who [...] "want to hear the 'Green Day of old' once more".|$|E

They worked on it again during the joint sessions for Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001). During this time, guitarist Ed O'Brien kept an online diary of the band's progress, and wrote in January 2000: [...] " [...] has been kicking around for about four years now and each time we approached it we {{seemed to be going}} down the same old paths. It actually sounds like the start of something exciting now." [...] One month later, he wrote: [...] "This is something like approach number 561 but it is a great song. It's simply {{trying to find a way}} of doing it which excites us. And we may <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> at the very least we've found a new approach … It may of course be utter crap and we have so lost the plot on this song. Please don't let that be the case." [...] The band failed to find an arrangement that satisfied them, and the song remained unreleased.|$|E

MysTech is {{a gift from the}} forces of Order to help the current universe's inhabitants fight Chaos. The team return to Anachronox to find Rowdy, a disguised citizen of Limbus who has been searching for the gate to the previous universe. Rowdy notes that they must destroy the key to the gate, now in the possession of Detta. The team infiltrate his fortress, kill him, and prepare to destroy the key at the gate itself—the fountain spiral of Anachronox. Grumpos seizes it, revealing himself to be a Dark Servant; he escapes with the agents of Chaos into the previous universe. Sly and the others prepare to follow them and save the universe; the game ends as they approach the gate.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Tom Sinclair {{considered}} {{that while the}} record was not ground-breaking, [...] "the Foos <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> {{to create their own}} archetype, with an instinctive feel for what constitutes a killer song", and praised [...] "how damn near flawless the tone of the whole set feels". Rolling Stones David Fricke praised the sonic variety, described by him as [...] "an anthology of strong new songs by a great bunch of bands, all calling themselves Foo Fighters". Jessica Letkemann of Billboard was acceptive of the [...] "delicious sundown grooves" [...] of the quieter piece and [...] "the Foos' usual soft-louder-loudest 'radio friendly unit shifters'" [...] - referencing a track of Nirvana's In Utero – while considering [...] "Home" [...] the only disappointing track. Robert Christgau rated the album a B, describing it as a [...] "candid attempt to recapitulate Nirvana Mark II's 10-year-old triumph, The Colour and the Shape". Henrik Holmgren of Melodic praised the production of the album and felt that Grohl singing [...] "gets better and better with every record." [...] Dave Simpson of The Guardian called Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace the band's [...] "most accomplished album", praising the composition and saying that [...] "Gil Norton's stunning production can't disguise the raw humanity beneath the sheen".|$|E
500|$|Jagnow {{commented on}} several changes the {{developers}} {{would have made}} in hindsight {{after the completion of}} the ARG. One aspect he considered was the weak part of the fiction of the ARG, something he believed they would have integrated more in the game from the start. The release of the Potato Sack on April 1 may have been a bad decision according to Jagnow, as they did not get the press exposure they thought they would in conjunction with the other April Fool's events occurring that day, with some media outlets hesitant to report on potential pranks for fear of having to retract these later. In the third phase, where certain players were [...] "taken over" [...] by GLaDOS, Jagnow felt they extracted these players from the game too early as they were influential in coordinating the chat rooms and wiki, leaving the remaining players confused. Instead, Jagnow suggested they should <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to allow these players to continue participating until near the end. Jagnow considered the push of the crescendo of the ARG, the [...] "appearance" [...] of GLaDOS@Home, to have been the biggest failing. Originally scheduled for April 16 or 17, it was pushed to April 15 to allow more players, including international ones, to participate in the effort to release Portal 2 early, and to gain media attention. [...] Instead, the developers found that existing players of the ARG were frustrated with no new puzzles to solves, while new players brought to the site by the media were skeptical and saw the event as [...] "a cheap media ploy to get players to buy the Potato Sack in the hope of an early Portal 2 release".|$|E

500|$|The Ninja Gaiden games {{gained a}} {{reputation}} throughout the gaming community for their difficulty and attention to detail. Although they appealed to gamers who, like Pro-G's Struan Robertson, wanted a [...] "bloody hard, but also bloody good" [...] challenge, it was feared that casual gamers would find the learning curve daunting. IGN warned that gamers with lesser skills might not [...] "get as much out of this game as others due to [...] incredible difficulty", and Edge commented that [...] "Tecmo’s refusal to extend any kind of handhold to less dedicated players is simply a failure of design, not a badge of hardcore honour" [...] and [...] "it’s impossible to believe they couldn’t <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to increase the accessibility of the game without undermining the gloriously intractable nature of the challenges it contains." [...] EGM found the challenge to be [...] "rewarding" [...] as it [...] "motivates you to actually get better at the game." [...] Clive Thompson focused on Ninja Gaiden in his Slate article examining the motivation for playing difficult games. He contends that extreme levels of challenge can be initially very frustrating and may cause a game to be abandoned in disgust. However, where a game also rewards a player's perseverance by teaching the skills required to overcome its challenges, that player will have the motivation to finish the game. Ninja Gaiden, in his opinion, strikes the correct balance between challenge and reward; completion brings [...] "a sort of exhausted exhilaration, like finally reaching the end of War and Peace." [...] In 2012, CraveOnline included it on their list of five [...] "badass ninja games", calling it [...] "the pinnacle of action gaming at the time, holding onto that crown {{for an entire year}} until God of War released in 2005" [...] and [...] "a true video game classic, and maybe the best ninja game of all time." [...] That same year, G4tv ranked it as the 83rd top video game of all time, also calling it [...] "the best ninja game ever made and one of the all around hardest." ...|$|E

The original market was Mexican-American men, but the company reports the product is having success as a health food, sought out by athletes and body builders.|$|E
2500|$|The double slit experiment, {{like the}} other six {{idealized}} experiments (microscope, split beam, tilt-teeth, radiation pattern, one-photon polarization, and polarization of paired photons), imposes a choice between complementary modes of observation. In each experiment we <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to delay that choice of type of phenomenon to be looked for up to the very final stage of development of the phenomenon, and it depends on whichever type of detection device we then fix upon. That delay makes {{no difference in the}} experimental predictions. On this score everything we find was foreshadowed in that solitary and pregnant sentence of Bohr, [...] "...it...can make no difference, as regards observable effects obtainable by a definite experimental arrangement, whether our plans for constructing or handling the instruments are fixed beforehand or whether we prefer to postpone the completion of our planning until a later moment when the particle is already on its way from one instrument to another." ...|$|E
2500|$|All {{reptiles}} breathe using lungs. Aquatic turtles {{have developed}} more permeable skin, and some species have modified their cloaca {{to increase the}} area for gas exchange. Even with these adaptations, breathing is never fully accomplished without lungs. Lung ventilation is accomplished differently in each main reptile group. In squamates, the lungs are ventilated almost exclusively by the axial musculature. This is also the same musculature that is used during locomotion. Because of this constraint, most squamates are forced to hold their breath during intense runs. Some, however, <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> around it. Varanids, {{and a few other}} lizard species, employ buccal pumping as a complement to their normal [...] "axial breathing". This allows the animals to completely fill their lungs during intense locomotion, and thus remain aerobically active for a long time. Tegu lizards are known to possess a proto-diaphragm, which separates the pulmonary cavity from the visceral cavity. While not actually capable of movement, it does allow for greater lung inflation, by taking the weight of the viscera off the lungs.|$|E
