5000|$|In common parlance, <b>endotherms</b> are {{characterized}} as [...] "warm-blooded". The opposite of endothermy is ectothermy, {{although there is}} no absolute or clear separation between the nature of <b>endotherms</b> and ectotherms in general.|$|R
50|$|Energy budget {{allocation}} varies for <b>endotherms</b> and ectotherms. Ectotherms {{rely on the}} environment as a heat source while <b>endotherms</b> maintain their body temperature through the regulation of metabolic processes. The heat produced in association with metabolic processes facilitates the active lifestyles of <b>endotherms</b> {{and their ability to}} travel far distances over a range of temperatures in the search for food. Ectotherms are limited by the ambient temperature of the environment around them but the lack of substantial metabolic heat production accounts for an energetically inexpensive metabolic rate. The energy demands for ectotherms are generally one tenth of that required for <b>endotherms.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first trait distinguishes mesotherms from ectotherms, {{the second}} from <b>endotherms.</b> For instance, <b>endotherms,</b> when cold, will {{generally}} resort to shivering or metabolizing brown fat {{to maintain a}} constant body temperature, leading to higher metabolic rates. A mesotherm, however, will experience lower body temperatures and lower metabolic rates as ambient temperature drop. In addition, mesotherm body temperatures tend to rise as body size increases (a phenomenon known as gigantothermy), unlike <b>endotherms.</b> This reflects the lower surface {{area to volume ratio}} in large animals, which reduces rates of heat loss.|$|R

(1996) revealed that <b>endotherms</b> tend to have larger nasal cross-sectional areas than ectotherms of the same mass. The reason offered for this observation was that larger nasal passages are needed to house the complex respiratory turbinates possessed by <b>endotherms.</b> Whales were excluded from the study {{on the grounds that they}} have no nasal turbinates. In the present study, the cross-sectional area of the nasal passages of nine species of Odontoceti were measured by the use of latex casts. The regression of log cross-sectional area vs. log mass yielded the same line for the whales of the current study as for the <b>endotherms</b> of the previous study.

40|$|<b>Endotherms</b> {{regulate}} {{their core}} body temperature by adjusting metabolic heat production and insulation. Endothermic body temperatures are therefore relatively stable compared to external temperatures. The thermal sensitivity of biochemical reaction rates {{is thought to}} have co-evolved with body temperature regulation so that optimal reaction rates occur at the regulated body temperature. However, recent data show that core body temperatures even of non-torpid <b>endotherms</b> fluctuate considerably. Additionally, peripheral temperatures can be considerably lower and more variable than core body temperatures. Here we discuss whether published data support the hypothesis that thermal performance curves of physiological reaction rates are plastic so that performance is maintained despite variable body temperatures within active (non-torpid) <b>endotherms,</b> and we explore mechanisms that confer plasticity. There is evidence that thermal performance curves in tissues that experience thermal fluctuations can be plastic, although this question remains relatively unexplored for <b>endotherms.</b> Mechanisms that alter thermal responses locally at the tissue level include transient potential receptor ion channels (TRPV and TRPM) and the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) both of which can influence metabolism and energy expenditure. Additionally, the thermal sensitivity of processes that cause post-transcriptional RNA degradation can promote the relative expression of cold-responsive genes. <b>Endotherms</b> can respond to environmental fluctuations similarly to ectotherms, and thermal plasticity complements core body temperature regulation to increase whole-organism performance. Thermal plasticity is ancestral to endothermic thermoregulation, but it has not lost its selective advantage so that modern <b>endotherms</b> are a physiological composite of ancestral ectothermic and derived endothermic traits...|$|R

5000|$|An <b>endotherm</b> (from Greek ἔνδον endon [...] "within" [...] and θέρμη thermē [...] "heat") is an {{organism}} that maintains its body at a metabolically favorable temperature, {{largely by the}} use of heat set free by its internal bodily functions instead of relying almost purely on ambient heat. Such internally generated heat is mainly an incidental product of the animal's routine metabolism, but under conditions of excessive cold or low activity an <b>endotherm</b> might apply special mechanisms adapted specifically to heat production. Examples include special-function muscular exertion such as shivering, and uncoupled oxidative metabolism such as within brown adipose tissue.Only birds and mammals are extant universally endothermic groups of animals. Certain lamnid sharks, tuna and billfishes are also endothermic.|$|E
5000|$|Often {{associated}} with low temperatures, {{the function of}} hibernation is to conserve energy during a period when sufficient food is unavailable. To achieve this energy saving, an <b>endotherm</b> will first decrease its metabolic rate, which then decreases body temperature.

50|$|Allen’s rule is a {{biological}} rule {{that says the}} limbs of an <b>endotherm</b> is either shorter in cold climates or longer in hot climates. Limb length affects the body’s surface area, which helps with thermoregulation. Shorter limbs help to conserve heat, while longer limbs help to dissipate heat. Marshall T.

5000|$|In {{contrast}} to ectotherms, <b>endotherms</b> rely largely, even predominantly, on heat from internal metabolic processes, and mesotherms use an intermediate strategy.|$|R
50|$|Ectotherms rely {{largely on}} {{external}} heat {{sources such as}} sunlight to achieve their optimal body temperature for various bodily activities. Accordingly, they depend on ambient conditions to reach operational body temperatures. In contrast, endothermic animals, as a rule, maintain nearly constant high operational body temperatures largely by reliance on internal heat produced by metabolically active organs (liver, kidney, heart, brain, muscle) or even by specialized heat producing organs like brown adipose tissue (BAT). Also, as a rule, ectotherms have lower metabolic rates than <b>endotherms</b> at a given body mass. As a consequence, <b>endotherms</b> generally rely on higher food consumption, and commonly on food of higher energy content. Such requirements may limit the carrying capacity of a given environment for <b>endotherms</b> as compared to its carrying capacity for ectotherms.|$|R
500|$|There {{has long}} been debate about the {{thermoregulation}} of dinosaurs, centered around whether they were ectotherms ("cold-blooded") or <b>endotherms</b> ("warm-blooded"). Mammals and birds are homeothermic <b>endotherms,</b> which generate their own body heat and have a high metabolism, whereas reptiles are heterothermic ectotherms, which receive their body heat from their surroundings. A 1996 study examined the oxygen isotopes from bone phosphates of animals from the Two Medicine Formation, including the juvenile Achelousaurus specimen [...] MOR591. δ18O values of phosphate in vertebrate bones depend on the δ18O values in their body water and the temperature when the bones were deposited, {{making it possible to}} measure fluctuations in temperature for each bone of an individual when they were deposited. The study analyzed seasonal variations in the body temperature and differences in temperature between skeletal regions, to determine whether the dinosaurs maintained their temperature seasonally. A varanid lizard fossil sampled for the study showed isotopic variation consistent with it being an heterothermic ectotherm. The variation of the dinosaurs, including Achelousaurus, was consistent with them being homeothermic <b>endotherms.</b> The metabolic rate of these dinosaurs was likely not as high as that of modern mammals and birds, and they may have been intermediate <b>endotherms.</b>|$|R

40|$|The heat {{dissipation}} limit (HDL) hypothesis {{suggests that the}} capacity of <b>endotherms</b> to dissipate body heat may impose constraints on their energy expenditure. Specifically, this hypothesis predicts that <b>endotherms</b> should avoid the detrimental consequences of hyperthermia by lowering their energy expenditure and reducing their activity in response to high ambient temperatures (T(a)). We used an extensive data set on the daily energy expenditure (DEE, n = 27) and the daily activity time (AT, n = 48) of male weasels (Mustela nivalis) during {{the spring and summer}} breeding season to test these predictions. We found that T(a) was related in a "hump-shaped" (i. e. convex) manner to AT, DEE, resting metabolic rate (RMR) and metabolic scope (the ratio of DEE to RMR). These results support the HDL hypothesis because in response to warm Tas male weasels reduced their AT, DEE, and RMR. Although the activity and energy expenditure of large <b>endotherms</b> {{are most likely to be}} constrained in response to warm Tas because they are less able to dissipate heat, our results suggest that small <b>endotherms</b> may also experience constraints consistent with the HDL hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|Synopsis Climate {{change is}} one of the major issues facing natural populations and thus a focus of recent {{research}} has been to predict the responses of organisms to these changes. Models are becoming more complex and now commonly include physiological traits of the organisms of interest. However, endothermic species have received less attention than have ectotherms in these mechanistic models. Further, it is not clear whether responses of <b>endotherms</b> to climate change are modified by variation in thermoregulatory characteristics associated with phenotypic plasticity and/or adaptation to past selective pressures. Here, we review the empirical data on thermal adaptation and acclimatization in <b>endotherms</b> and discuss how those factors may be important in models of responses to climate change. We begin with a discussion of why thermoregulation and thermal sensitivity at high body temperatures should be co-adapted. Importantly, we show that there is, in fact, considerable variation in the ability of <b>endotherms</b> to tolerate high body temperatures and/or high environmental temperatures, but a better understanding of this variation will likely be critical for predicting responses to future climatic scenarios. Next, we discuss why variation in thermoregulatory characteristics should be considered when modeling the effects of climate change on heterothermic <b>endotherms.</b> Finally, we review some biophysical and biochem-ical factors that will limit adaptation and acclimation in <b>endotherms.</b> We consider both long-term, directional climate change and short-term (but increasingly common) anomalies in climate such as extreme heat waves and we suggest areas of important future research relating to both our basic understanding of endothermic thermoregulation and the response...|$|R
40|$|For many animals, notably herbivores, {{plants are}} often an {{inadequate}} food source given the low content of protein and high content of C-rich material.

Applying stoichiometric principles, we hypothesized that <b>endotherms</b> can cope with diets with much higher (metabolizable) carbon to nitrogen ratios than ectotherms. Using empirical data on birds, eutherian mammals, marsupials and reptiles, we compiled and compared measurements and allometric equations for energy metabolism as well as nitrogen requirements. Our analysis supports our hypothesis that plants, and especially their leaves, are generally sufficiently rich in nitrogen to fulfil protein demands in <b>endotherms,</b> at least during maintenance conditions, but less so in ectotherms.

50|$|Dicynodonts, {{including}} Eosimops, {{have been}} suspected {{for some time}} to be endothermic. In a histological study of the closely related Diictodon, another pylaecephalid, rapid bone growth is shown to be part of their early ontogeny. Continued growth during adult stages was also observed. This rapid growth as well as moderately vascularized bones suggests that Diictodon could have been an <b>endotherm,</b> and that Eosimops could have been as well. This would be consistent with the hypothesis that more derived dicynodonts were endotherms, as endothermy would likely have been evolved early in the taxon’s history.|$|E
50|$|If Giraffatitan was {{endothermic}} (warm-blooded), {{it would}} have taken an estimated ten years to reach full size, if it were instead poikilothermic (cold-blooded), then {{it would have}} required over 100 years to reach full size.

If Giraffatitan was fully cold-blooded or was a passive bulk <b>endotherm,</b> it would have needed far less food to meet its daily energy needs. Some scientists have proposed that large dinosaurs like Giraffatitan were gigantotherms. Internal organs of these giant sauropods were probably enormous.|$|E
50|$|Maintaining {{homeostasis}} through internal regulatory mechanisms {{is directly}} affected by habitat variation. The common raven {{is considered to be}} a homeotherm, an <b>endotherm,</b> and a regulator, so it is required to adjust its internal physiological state in response to environmental changes. Food habitats influence the metabolic rate of the Common Raven. Since common ravens are omnivores, metabolic rates must fluctuate according to the type of food consumed. According to one study, species that consume only fruit possess lower metabolisms compared to species that ate both fruit and insect material. The high metabolic rate of the common raven is partially due to the diversity of its diet.|$|E

Other species of Dasyriuds in arid Australia use torpor and is an adaptation to combat limited resource availability.The benefits of torpor include having an extended lifetime; this is advantageous in the harsh arid environment enabling recovery of populations after stochastic weather events such as flooding or drought.

50|$|Reptiles {{and more}} {{primitive}} synapsids have conchae, but these plates of bone {{are involved in}} sensing smell rather than preventing desiccation. While the maxilloturbinates of mammals {{are located in the}} path of airflow to collect moisture, sensory cochae in both mammals and reptiles are positioned farther back and above the nasal passage, away from the flow of air. Glanosuchus has ridges positioned low in the nasal cavity, indicating that it had maxilloturbinates that were in the direct path of airflow. The maxilloturbinates may not have been preserved because they were either very thin or cartilaginous. The possibility has also been raised that these ridges are associated with an olfactory epithelium rather than turbinates. Nonetheless, the possible presence of maxilloturbinates suggests that Glanosuchus may have been able to rapidly breathe without drying out the nasal passage, and therefore could have been an <b>endotherm.</b>|$|E

Respiratory control ratios were higher in mitochondria from larger birds. Mitochondrial proton conductance in liver mitochondria from birds correlated strongly with body mass [respiration rate per mg of protein driving proton leak at 170 mV being 44. 7 times (body mass in g) (- 0. 19) ], thus suggesting a general relationship between body mass and proton conductance in <b>endotherms.</b> Mitochondria from larger birds had the same or perhaps greater surface area per mg of protein than mitochondria from smaller birds. Hence, the lower proton conductance was caused not by surface area changes but by some change in the properties of the inner membrane. Liver mitochondria from larger birds had phospholipid fatty acyl chains that were less polyunsaturated and more monounsaturated when compared with those from smaller birds. Phospholipid fatty acyl polyunsaturation correlated positively and monounsaturation correlated negatively with proton conductance.
