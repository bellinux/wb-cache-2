500|$|Kubica {{said that}} his poor start was due to wheelspin off the line, and the {{presence}} of oil on the track impeded the performance of his car, leading to Räikkönen's pass: [...] "But anyway <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> good result: third and fourth for the team and leading the Constructors' Championship, so it was good weekend." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{decided to}} forgo working with Butch Vig, who had {{produced}} the group's previous albums, and selected Flood and Alan Moulder as co-producers. Corgan explained, [...] "To be completely honest, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> situation where we'd become {{so close to}} Butch that it started to work to our disadvantage... I just felt we had to force the situation, sonically, and take ourselves out of normal Pumpkin recording mode. I didn't want to repeat past Pumpkin work." ...|$|E

500|$|Of the end result, Spotnitz said [...] "I {{was very}} pleased with the way it was executed, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> good mystery. He later wrote that he [...] "liked [...] more as time has gone on." [...] Director Rob Bowman {{admitted}} to being tired and not inspired by the time this episode—the second to last of the season—was produced. This lack of interest later resulted in the episode taking extra time to finish. Bowman later recalled that the most difficult aspect of the episode was filming the climactic human sacrifice scene, if only because of the ceremonial mask featured. He explained, [...] "the mask {{scared the hell out of}} me only because I thought, 'Boy, if I don't shoot this right, it's going to be silly." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{end of the}} storyline was criticised by gay advocates after Charlie {{was seen}} having sex with Hugo Austin (Bernard Curry) and Joey left Summer Bay alone. Anderson also {{suggested}} that Hugo may {{have been enough to}} [...] "sway" [...] Charlie towards men. Some sceptics had suggested that Home and Away would not allow Charlie and Joey to remain in a same-sex relationship. Anderson later acknowledged she had feared that the story would see her typecast as [...] "the lesbian cop." [...] Anderson reflected on the storyline during an interview with The Daily Telegraph, saying [...] "The Charlie/Joey (lesbian) storyline was the first time you got to see Charlie's vulnerable side. (The controversy) blew my mind – I wasn't expecting it at all. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> fantastic storyline because for the first time I got to show the producers and audience what I could do." ...|$|E
500|$|In a December 2012 interview, Winkelman {{expressed}} some regret {{about what}} had happened. [...] "I'm not {{proud of the way}} this club came to exist, and I am totally prepared to be the villain of the piece, but I can't put the genie back in the bottle," [...] he said. [...] "Do I think it was right? No. Do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> great thing that happened to Wimbledon? No... I don’t feel in the right over the way this club was born. But I don’t think I could live with myself if I hadn't gone out and bought the club when it was hours away from liquidation. It was about to be completely finito... What happened was my fault, and I have to take responsibility for it. But I don’t see why my players, staff and our young supporter base should be forced to carry the can and live with the nastiness, it's nothing to do with them." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{overtaking}} manoeuvres made by Coulthard on Michael Schumacher {{received much}} media attention after the race. Coulthard accused Michael Schumacher of unsporting behaviour and dangerous driving, saying: [...] "I had a clean run at Michael {{on the outside}} and equally I felt he drove me wide. You could say he had the right to do that because he had the track position, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> deliberate gesture in trying to run someone wide like that and I was very angry." [...] Michael Schumacher later denied any wrongdoing and citied a similar incident at the 1999 Japanese Grand Prix where Coulthard pushed him wide although no objections were made. He also admitted that he did not see Coulthard's hand gesture. Coulthard sought clarification with the FIA over such overtakes with a source from Formula One's governing body noting: [...] "It was hard racing -- they are racing drivers aren't they?" [...] GrandPrix.com said that Coulthard's overtake meant that [...] "He is ready to stand up to Michael and he is not afraid of what will happen if Michael does not lift." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Night of Your Life" [...] {{was written}} by Cristyle Johnson, Anthony Preston, David Guetta and Giorgio Tuinfort, whilst {{production}} of the song was helmed by Guetta and Tuinfort. In an interview with Akshay Bhansali of MTV News, Guetta revealed {{that he did not}} know Hudson before collaborating on the song, saying, [...] "I had heard her voice [...] and I fell in love with it. It's a difficult song. You need a really big voice to be able to perform that song. I was like, 'Whoa!' She obviously has an amazing voice, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> really interesting exercise for her and for me." [...] Guetta further explained that when he collaborates with artists, he likes to [...] "take them out of their boxes", and creating a dance record with Hudson was [...] "really exciting" [...] for him. On working with Hudson, he said, [...] "She is beautiful in every way: as a person, as a singer, as a human being. She delivered [...] like crazy." [...] "Night of Your Life" [...] was released for digital download on August 22, 2011, as the third and final promotional single from the album, as part of the iTunes Store's countdown to the album's release.|$|E
500|$|Talking {{about her}} {{feelings}} {{when she got}} the part, Bell expressed, [...] "Since I was 4 years old, I dreamed {{of being in a}} Disney animated film," [...] she said. [...] "It was the first goal I ever set for myself. It seemed like {{it would be a very}} unrealistic one." [...] She described Disney movies as [...] "the ones [...] watched over and over again when [...] was a kid," [...] and continued, [...] "I knew every line from The Little Mermaid. I love Aladdin. When asked about her favorite Disney character, Bell said, [...] "Ariel from The Little Mermaid. Because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> shift that Disney had, where a female lead—the [...] "princess," [...] I guess—didn't just want to find her mate. She was singing [...] "I want to be where the people are. I want to see the world. I want to venture outside my comfort zone."" [...] Bell described her initial reaction when she first found that she was cast as [...] "I was in glee". Lee admitted Bell's casting selection was influenced after the filmmakers listened a couple of vocal tracks from The Little Mermaid, including [...] "Part of Your World" [...] that the actress recorded when she was young, stating that without these recordings, it would've been very difficult to the find the right one to play Anna.|$|E

I certainly would love to think that they actually reached the summit of Everest. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a lovely thought and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> something, you know, gut emotion, yes I would love them to have got there.

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed critical reception. The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin {{found the}} episode less enjoyable than [...] "Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter". He explained {{that when he}} first learned that the show would tackle the Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien situation [...] "I {{felt a surge of}} excitement and optimism. I thought the writers would come up with a smart new angle to attack the imbroglio", but after the airing he noted the janitor plot only hampered the episode. Rabin, however, enjoyed Tracy's actions in the episode, commenting that it [...] "provided a showcase for some great Tracy Morgan non-sequiturs". Emily Exton of Entertainment Weekly also found [...] "Khonani" [...] the weaker of the two episodes, and also believed that the [...] "late-night jokes felt tired". Television columnist Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger disliked the episode, and as a result he noted in his recap that he would remove 30 Rock from the rotation of shows for which he always did detailed reviews. Willa Paskin of New York magazine wrote had the show make reference to the Leno and O'Brien debacle a few months ago [...] "this would have been a cutting-edge satire... Now, not so much." [...] Jason Hughes of TV Squad remarked that the writing in [...] "Khonani" [...] was sharp, though added that [...] "for some reason" [...] the episode [...] "didn't ring nearly as sharp or funny as many others. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> lot of unfulfilled potential." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste magazine deemed this episode disappointing, but proclaimed [...] "it was still entertaining enough." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} show ended, Minka Kelly made a post of her {{thoughts}} on Twitter about the cancellation of the show with her fans.

Lickona told the Austin Chronicle [...] "I've seen it many times – it's a very popular party tape among friends. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> great show, and it might be as offensive today as it was back then." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ronaldo has {{at times}} been criticised for diving when tackled, about which his Madrid {{teammate}} Sergio Ramos responded after a 3–1 victory over Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup: [...] "He {{was a long}} way from me. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> moment of play that unbalanced him and he didn't feign anything,". Despite his talent, he was also occasionally criticised early in his career by manager Alex Ferguson, teammates and the media for being a selfish or overly flamboyant player.|$|E

I tried to do whatever I could to hit it and the goal was given, simple as that. I was pushed in over the line so it should have been a penalty anyway. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> perfect goal".|$|E
2500|$|Charlotte Gainsbourg as [...] "She": French actress Eva Green was {{initially}} approached {{for the female}} lead. According to Trier, Green was positive about appearing in the film, but her agents refused to allow her. The unsuccessful casting attempt took two months of the pre-production process. Eventually Gainsbourg turned up, and by Trier's words she was very eager to get cast: [...] "Charlotte came in and said, 'I'm dying to get the part no matter what.'

[...] Sophie Lawrence has said, [...] "Diane {{was a bit of}} a wild child...she was a bit naughty, she was always in trouble.
