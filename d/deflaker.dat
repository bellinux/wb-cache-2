40|$|The primary {{driver for}} a {{successful}} biological nutrient removal is the availability of suitable carbon source, mainly {{in the form of}} volatile fatty acids (VFA). Several methods have been examined {{to increase the amount of}} VFAs in wastewater. This study investigates the mechanism of mechanical disintegration of thickened surplus activated sludge by a <b>deflaker</b> technology for the production of organic matter. This equipment was able to increase the soluble carbon in terms of VFA and soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) with the maximum concentration to be around 850 and 6530 mg l− 1, for VFA and SCOD, respectively. The particle size was reduced from 65. 5 to 9. 3 μm after 15 min of disintegration with the simultaneous release of proteins (1550 mg l− 1) and carbohydrates (307 mg l− 1) indicating floc disruption and breakage. High performance size exclusion chromatography investigated the disintegrated sludge and confirmed that the <b>deflaker</b> was able to destroy the flocs releasing polymeric substances that are typically found outside of cells. When long disintegration times were applied (10 min or 9000 kJ kg− 1 TS of specific energy) smaller molecular size materials were released to the liquid phase, which are considered to be found inside the cells indicating cell lysis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Primary sludge {{collected}} from 5 different full-scale sewage treatment {{works in the}} UK were fermented in 5 L vessels mechanically stirred at 20 °C for 4 days. During the fermentation process the VFAs content increased by up to 8. 8 g/L (initial concentration of 3. 5 g/L). Acetic acid and propionic acid were the main products formed {{and the production of}} VFAs was linked with the suspended solids and volatile solids content of the primary sludge. In comparison, surplus activated sludge (SAS), obtained from a 1 m 3 pilot scale BNR process was mechanical disintegrated using a <b>deflaker.</b> The mechanical disintegration of the SAS increased the VFAs from 19 to 530 m/L and the soluble COD from 159 to 500 mg/L. The products of the fermentation process and SAS disintegration were used in laboratory tests to predict the biological phosphorus and nitrogen removal during BNR. Acetate, which is a chemical carbon source frequently used to enhance BNR was also used. The carbon source obtained from fermentation and disintegration treatments were capable of enhancing P release and denitrification up to 0. 144 mg P/L·min and 0. 04 mg NO 3 /g VSS·min, respectively, in comparison to acetate (0. 077 mg P/L·min and 0. 023 mg NO 3 /g VSS·min). The results demonstrate that hydrolysed or disintegrated primary or secondary sludges enhanced P release and denitrification at a higher rate than chemical carbon sources such as acetate...|$|E
40|$|There {{is a need}} to {{investigate}} processes that enable sludge re-use while enhancing sewage treatment efficiency. Mechanically disintegrated thickened surplus activated sludge (SAS) and fermented primary sludge were compared for their capacity to produce a carbon source suitable for BNR by completing nutrient removal predictive tests. Mechanically disintegration of SAS using a <b>deflaker</b> enhanced volatile fatty acids (VFAs) content from 92 to 374 mg l− 1 (4. 1 -fold increase). In comparison, primary sludge fermentation increased the VFAs content from 3. 5 g l− 1 to a final concentration of 8. 7 g l− 1 (2. 5 -fold increase). The carbon source obtained from disintegration and fermentation treatments improved phosphate (PO 4 -P) release and denitrification by up to 0. 04 mg NO 3 -N g− 1 VSS min− 1 and 0. 031 mg PO 4 -P g− 1 VSS min− 1, respectively, in comparison to acetate (0. 023 mg NO 3 -N g− 1 VSS min− 1 and 0. 010 mg PO 4 -P g− 1 VSS min− 1). Overall, both types of sludge were suitable for BNR but disintegrated SAS displayed lower carbon to nutrient ratios of 8 for SCOD:PO 4 -P and 9 for SCOD:NO 3 -N. On the other hand, SAS increased the concentration of PO 4 -P in the settled sewage by a further 0. 97 g PO 4 -P kg− 1 SCOD indicating its potential negative impact towards nutrient recy...|$|E
40|$|Process {{optimization}} {{is needed}} for the development and expansion of the biogas industry and to meet the ever growing demand for methane. This thesis explores process technologies {{for the development of}} the anaerobic digestion process and includes pre-treatments, studies on the effects of different mixing modes and evaluation of a water treatment technology. Two pre-treatments were evaluated, mechanical and electroporation, for treatment of ley crop silage. Mechanical treatment included two milling machines designed for recycling of paper, Grubben <b>deflaker</b> and Krima disperser, and showed an increased biogas production of 59  % and 43  % respectively as well as a positive energy balance and economic results [...] Electroporation increased the biogas production with 16 %, however, development is needed to increase its energy efficiency. Digester mixing has an effect on the digestion result. The performed review and experiments show that the mixing demand increases with organic loading. Excessive mixing during process start up, instabilities and shock loads leads to increased volatile fatty acid concentrations and process inhibition. Reduction of mixing reduces the effects of process instabilities and periodical mixing with mixing breaks has been shown to be beneficial for biogas production. A high temperature membrane filtration unit was evaluated at 70  °C, 90  °C and 110  °C to determine separation efficiencies, permeation speed when treating process water at a biogas plant.  Improved separation can increase the capacity of the substrate pre-processing and reduce process related problems. The results show a total solids separation of 60 %, and an increasing filtration speed with temperature with fluxes of between 113 and 464 L/ h m 2. The substrate pre-processing could theoretically handle up to 29  % more substrate as a result. Integration of these technologies in a biogas plant show that the pre-treatments studied exhibits a good performance when integrated and that mixing reduction has the potential to lower the process electricity demand by 23 % in the performed case study. However, even though the membrane filtration unit shows promising results it would demand a relatively high energy consumption and lead to limited benefits to a process already at it maximum organic loading...|$|E
40|$|The {{removal of}} {{nutrients}} from the wastewaters through biological processes is a cost effective and environmentally sound alternative to chemical treatment. The primary driver {{for the success}} of the biological nutrient removal (BNR) processes is the availability of suitable carbon sources in the influent wastewater. Unfortunately, in the UK the wastewaters considered being weak for the BNR carbon limited processes and hence many methods have been examined in the past for the enhancement of BNR. In this project an internal carbon source was proposed and examined. The carbon was produced from the disintegration of activated sludge by a mechanical process, which was explored {{and its impact on the}} BNR carbon limited processes was evaluated. The equipment used in this study for mechanical sludge disintegration was a <b>deflaker,</b> which was able to cause significant increase in chemical oxygen demand and volatile fatty acids (VFA) in the soluble phase of sludge. Laboratory scale tests revealed that this carbon source can improve the phosphorus release and denitrification process and hence the phosphorus and nitrogen removal. These results led us to investigate the carbon source produced from disintegration in pilot scale and two BNR reactors were used for this purpose. The mechanical disintegration of 5. 8 % of return activated sludge was able to increase the concentration of VFA in the influent wastewater by 2. 5 - 7 mg l- 1 and successfully replace the equivalent amount of acetic acid, which is normally considered to be the best carbon source for biological phosphorus removal. The performance of the test reactor in terms of nitrogen, suspended solids and chemical oxygen demand was also unaffected. In addition, the sludge disintegration affected the bacteria growth yield, which combined with the longer sludge age by 6 days compared to the control reactor caused a 20 - 26 % reduction in sludge production. In order to examine whether this process could be used by the water utilities a cost analysis took place, which revealed that the operational cost of the specific disintegration process and under the conditions examined in this study outweighs the savings from the produced carbon source and reduced amount of sludge.
