5|$|<b>Dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> is {{provided}} through the three semicircular canals. These three canals are orthogonal (at right angles) to each other. At {{the end of}} each canal is a slight enlargement, known as the ampulla, which contains numerous cells with filaments in a central area called the cupula. The fluid in these canals rotates according to the momentum of the head. When a person changes acceleration, the inertia of the fluid changes. This affects the pressure on the cupula, and results in the opening of ion channels. This causes depolarisation, which is passed as a signal to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> also helps maintain eye tracking when moving, via the vestibulo–ocular reflex.|$|E

5|$|The {{inner ear}} sits within the {{temporal}} bone in a complex cavity called the bony labyrinth. A central area known as the vestibule contains two small fluid-filled recesses, the utricle and saccule. These connect to the semicircular canals and the cochlea. There are three semicircular canals angled {{at right angles to}} each other which are responsible for <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance.</b> The cochlea is a spiral shell-shaped organ responsible for the sense of hearing. These structures together create the membranous labyrinth.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a {{new type}} of {{vibration}} structure (i. e. swing frame) of vertical <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> machine is designed, which is based on the analysis of traditional double-plane vertical <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> machine’s swing frame. The static unbalance and couple unbalance can be separated effectively by using the new <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> machine with the new swing frame. The modal and harmonic responses are analyzed by using the ANSYS 7. 0. By comparing the finite element modal analysis with the experimental modal analysis, the natural frequencies and vibration modes are found out, which can provide the dynamics direction for designing vertical <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> machine. The new <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> machine can measure static unbalance and couple unbalance directly, and the influence between them is faint. The practical result indicates that the new vertical <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> machine is suitable for inertial measurement of flying objects, and can overcome the shortcomings of traditional double-plane vertical <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> machines, in which the effect of plane-separation is inferior. The vertical <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> machine with the new vibration structure can be widely used in the future application...|$|R

This paper gives an overview {{of some of the}} issues, concepts and types of load balancing used. The type of balancing can mainly be classified as static <b>balancing</b> or <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing.</b> <b>Dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> can be further broken down into various different flavors, all of which are dependent upon the specific application being run and it’s characteristics. Some methods of <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> are discussed here. A different type of balancing is based on data locality. This is also discussed here...|$|R
40|$|Static {{balancing}} {{assessment is}} often complemented with <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> tasks. Numerous <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> assessment {{methods have been}} developed in recent decades with their corresponding balancing devices and tasks. The aim of this systematic literature review is to identify and categorize existing objective methods of standing <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> ability assessment {{with an emphasis on}} the balancing devices and tasks being used. Three major scientific literature databases (Science Direct, Web of Science, PLoS ONE) and additional sources were used. Studies had to use a <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> device and a task described in detail. Evaluation had to be based on objectively measureable parameters. Functional tests without instrumentation evaluated exclusively by a clinician were excluded. A total of 63 articles were included. The data extracted during full-text assessment were: author and date; the balancing device with the balancing task and the measured parameters; the health conditions, size, age and sex of participant groups; and follow-up measurements. A variety of <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> assessment devices were identified and categorized as 1) Solid ground, 2) Balance board, 3) Rotating platform, 4) Horizontal translational platform, 5) Treadmill, 6) Computerized Dynamic Posturography, and 7) Other devices. The group discrimination ability of the methods was explored and the conclusions of the studies were briefly summarized. Due to the wide scope of this search, it provides an overview of balancing devices and do not represent the state-of-the-art of any single method. The identified <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> assessment methods are offered as a catalogue of candidate methods to complement static assessments used in studies involving postural control...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> {{with respect to}} a given {{trajectory}} is proposed in this paper. Trajectory-based <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> is a technique that brings additional mechanisms to unbalanced mechanisms with the purpose of actuating the original mechanism to move along a predefined trajectory, regardless of the shaking forces and moments. In this work, a planar three degrees of freedom (3 -DOF) serial-parallel mechanism is proposed to implement this technique on an unbalanced platform. The overall structure of the system is firstly introduced and the mechanical design and kinematics of the proposed mechanism is then presented. The dynamic model of the mechanism and the platform is derived and analysed. Finally, numerical examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of the active <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> mechanism and the improved dynamic performance of the system...|$|R

[...] "Music emerging from one speaker {{behind the screen}} sounds thin, tinkly and strainy. We wanted to reproduce such beautiful masterpieces... so that audiences would {{feel as though they}} were standing at the podium with Stokowski". For the recording of The Sorcerer's Apprentice in January 1938, engineers at Disney collaborated with RCA Corporation for using multiple audio channels which allowed any desired <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> to be achieved upon playback. The stage was altered acoustically with double plywood semi-circular partitions that separated the orchestra into five sections to increase reverberation. Though as the production of Fantasia developed, the setup used for The Sorcerer's Apprentice was abandoned for different multi-channel recording arrangements.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} full {{compensation}} against the resultant shaking forces and moments for arbitrary robots using a single active <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> mechanism is first addressed. And the application principle and general balancing {{conditions of the}} active <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> mechanism are presented. With the purpose of providing detailed description of these problems, a compact planar 3 -degree-of-freedom active <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> mechanism is proposed. The active balancer is composed of three independent rotating bars with their respective actuators. The rotations of the three bars could change their center of gravity positions and then generate balancing forces for the unbalanced robots. Moreover, {{the changing of the}} angular acceleration of the bars can also generate a <b>dynamic</b> torque to <b>balance</b> the shaking moment. In order to present more detail of the balancing theory, the structure and kinematic and dynamic analysis of the proposed balancing mechanism are given.

30|$|When {{sudden load}} or {{generation}} changes happen in microgrids, <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> strategy regulates setpoints of generators or controllable loads {{to reduce the}} mismatch during the transient state. This mitigates frequency and voltage oscillations in the system. However, combustion generation units, such as diesel generators and micro-turbine generators, cannot quickly respond to these sudden changes in microgrids. This delayed response may result in significant frequency and voltage oscillations. In this situation, energy storage and additional controllable loads {{can be used to}} compensate for the generation and load changes in microgrids due to their faster response times. Energy storage devices commonly used for <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> include batteries, ultra-capacitors, flywheels, and others. Controllable loads typically considered for <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> include service loads such as washing machines, dryer loads, air conditioning, heater loads, and any other 240  V domestic load (PEVs included).|$|R

N-body {{problems such as}} Molecular Dynamics simulations are common candidates for such studies. The ability to perform dynamic load-balancing offers the potential of improving performance, but the implementation of hardware architectures implementing load balancing is often tedious and error prone. Further, the isolation and quantification of performance gains rendered by the integration of <b>dynamic</b> load <b>balancing</b> hardware presents a challenge for system developers.
