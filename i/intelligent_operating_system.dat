40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of an adaptive, <b>intelligent</b> <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> scheduler, based on machine-learning of heuristics. This scheduler is termed the adaptive scheduler controller (ASC). The question which the project seeks to answer is whether expert system technology, specifically the technique of machine-learning of heuristics developed by Waterman (1970), can be successfully used to create an adaptive scheduler. Such an adaptive scheduler {{could be expected to}} operate in an environment which is not completely determined. The procedure for machine-learning of heuristics is as follows. The ASC makes a series of decisions and then observes the behavior of the system as determined by these decisions. From this feedback the ASC deduces what the correct decisions should have been and compares the correct decisions to the ones it actually made. For each incorrect decision the ASC will modify its set of production rules, or heuristics, so that the incorrect decision will not be made in the future. The results are that the ASC was able to adapt successfully to changes in its environment and to its own behavior. It learned rules to correctly assign priorities to processes even though the behavior of these processes changed. It also was able to recover from errors which it made in assigning priorities. One may conclude that the techniques of machine-learning of heuristics can be used to create an adaptive scheduler. This technique may find wider applications to systems programming problems in which the system is required to make complex decisions in a variable environment...|$|E

40|$|This thesis proposes {{the use of}} {{traditional}} distributed <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> and distributed systems techniques that are adapted and applied to the wireless sensor network domain. These techniques are applied {{to the creation of}} a wireless sensor network <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> that allows complex applications to be created without special programmer knowledge of sensor network programming or architecture. The resulting system is capable of executing a high level user application written in conventional single-system-image form, without the user being aware of the mesh architecture or underlying sensor node hardware. A wireless sensor network is a collection of battery-powered embedded systems that communicate over low-bandwidth radio. Because of their limited hardware, niche deployments and use of embedded processors, programming techniques for wireless sensor network nodes are generally relatively esoteric compared to most software programming tasks. This can be relatively complex for programmers not familiar with the wireless sensor network domain. A naive approach to writing a wireless sensor network application may well result in considerably reduced battery life due to inefficient use of the limited power resources, requiring an expensive and time-consuming replacement or patching process. As a result of this complexity, traditional wireless sensor network applications are written as simply as possible. The majority of these applications simply move passive data readings back across a mesh to a more powerful server. While this is a sufficiently effective approach in some situations, for other sensor network deployments involving large amounts of complex data it is more efficient for the sensor network application to process at least some of the data inside the mesh, saving on unnecessary data transmissions. However in the real world, the complexity of writing such an application in many cases precludes this from being created. An <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> that provides power-efficient distributed processing while presenting a more standard unified single system image to the application developer would provide new possibilities for sensor network application developers in terms of creating dynamic and complex sensor network applications. This thesis covers the design decisions, development process and evaluation of the Hydra distributed wireless sensor network <b>operating</b> <b>system,</b> an <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> that provides these services. The system is evaluated in the form of a scenario for monitoring intruders over a large area using accelerometer monitoring [...] during this scenario, power efficiency is gained due to the <b>intelligent</b> Hydra <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> services, as the resulting accelerometer data is not moved across potentially multi-hop network links. Application code complexity is also reduced due to the higher-level single system image programming environment...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} case study of {{artificial}} intelligence techniques applied to the control of production printing equipment. Like many other real-world applications, this complex domain requires high-speed autonomous decision-making and robust continual operation. To our knowledge, this work represents the first successful industrial application of embedded domain-independent temporal planning. Our system handles execution failures and multi-objective preferences. At its heart is an on-line algorithm that combines techniques from state-space planning and partial-order scheduling. We suggest that this general architecture may prove useful in other applications as more <b>intelligent</b> <b>systems</b> <b>operate</b> in continual, on-line settings. Our system has been used to drive several commercial prototypes and has enabled a new product architecture for our industrial partner. When compared with state-of-the-art off-line planners, our system is hundreds of times faster and often finds better plans. Our experience demonstrates that domain-independent AI planning based on heuristic search can flexibly handle time, resources, replanning, and multiple objectives in a high-speed practical application without requiring hand-coded control knowledge...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Knowledge {{acquisition}} and model maintenance are key problems in knowledge engineering {{to improve the}} productivity {{in the development of}} intelligent systems. Although historically a number of technical solutions have been proposed in this area, the recent experience shows that there is still an important gap between the way end-users describe their expertise and the way intelligent systems represent knowledge. In this paper we propose an original way to cope with this problem based on electronic documents. We propose the concept of intelligent document processor as a tool that allows the end-user to read/write a document explaining how an <b>intelligent</b> <b>system</b> <b>operates</b> in such a way that, if the user changes the content of the document, the intelligent system will react to these changes. The paper presents the structure of such a document based on knowledge categories derived from the modern knowledge modeling methodologies together with a number of requirements to be understandable by end-users and problem solvers. ...|$|R
