6000|$|On {{the stage}} (and here I come {{at last to}} my own {{particular}} function in the matter), Comedy, as a destructive, derisory, critical, negative art, kept the theatre open when sublime tragedy perished. From Molière to Oscar Wilde we had a line of comedic playwrights who, if they had nothing fundamentally positive to say, were at least in revolt against falsehood and imposture, and were not only, as they claimed, 'chastening morals by ridicule,' but, in Johnson's phrase, clearing our minds of cant, and thereby shewing an uneasiness {{in the presence of}} error which is the surest symptom of intellectual vitality. Meanwhile the name of Tragedy was assumed by plays in which everyone was killed in the last act, just as, in spite of Molière, plays in which everyone was married in the last act called themselves comedies. Now neither tragedies nor comedies can be produced according to a prescription which gives only the last moments of the last act. Shakespear did not make Hamlet out of its final butchery, nor Twelfth Night out of its final matrimony. And he could not become the conscious iconographer of a religion because he had no conscious religion. He had therefore to exercise his extraordinary natural gifts in the very entertaining art of mimicry, giving us the famous 'delineation of character' which makes his plays, like the novels of Scott, Dumas, and Dickens, so delightful. Also, he developed that curious and questionable art of building us a refuge from despair by disguising the cruelties of Nature as jokes. But with all his gifts, the fact remains that he never found the inspiration to write an original play. He furbished up old plays, and adapted popular stories, and chapters of history from Holinshed's Chronicle and Plutarch's biographies, to the stage. All this he did (or did not; for there are minus quantities in the algebra of art) with a recklessness which shewed that his trade lay far from his conscience. It is true that he never takes his characters from the borrowed story, because it was less trouble and more fun to him to create them afresh; but none the less he heaps the murders and villainies of the borrowed story on his own essentially gentle creations without scruple, no matter how incongruous they may be. And all the time his vital need for a philosophy drives him to seek one by the quaint professional method of introducing philosophers as characters into his plays, and even of making his heroes philosophers; but when they come on the stage they have no philosophy to expound: they are only pessimists and railers; and their occasional would-be philosophic speeches, such as The Seven Ages of Man and The Soliloquy on Suicide, shew how deeply in the dark Shakespear was as to what philosophy means. He forced himself in among the greatest of playwrights without having once entered that region in which Michael Angelo, Beethoven, Goethe, and the antique Athenian stage poets are great. He would really not be great at all if it were not that he had religion enough to be aware that his religionless condition was one of despair. His towering King Lear would be only a melodrama were it not for its <b>express</b> <b>admission</b> that if there is nothing more to be said of the universe than Hamlet has to say, then 'as flies to wanton boys are we to the gods: they kill us for their sport.' ...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the trend and seasonal variation in hospital admissions for childhood asthma in the Athens region of Greece. METHODS [...] Data were obtained from hospital registries of the three main children's hospitals in Athens between 1978 and 1988. Children admitted with the diagnosis of asthma, asthmatic bronchitis, or wheezy bronchitis were included. The data were <b>expressed</b> as <b>admission</b> rates per 100, 000 of the same aged population. RESULTS [...] There were 9795 admissions for asthma over the 11 years and the admission rate rose by 294 %. Admissions among those aged 0 - 4 and 5 - 14 rose by 272 % and 379 % respectively. Monthly admissions showed a pronounced seasonal variation, rising during the cold damp period in the 0 - 4 age group, but peaking around May in the 5 - 14 age group. CONCLUSIONS [...] These findings suggest that hospital admissions due to asthma in the Athens region have increased considerably since 1978, and that clear cut seasonal variations exist which are specific to age...|$|R

In 1979, assisted by the Northwest Area Foundation, Newgate purchased a mechanics garage at 90 North Dale St in St Paul and established the Auto Body Training Center, serving young adults who had dropped out of school. Twelve years later, Newgate purchased its current property at 2900 East Hennepin Minneapolis, MN 55413.

We don't care about that. We're looking at ability and attitude.” Newgate also welcomed Hmong Americans, immigrants for whom the Twin Cities was becoming one of the top two settlement areas in the US. Now all of Newgate’s cash-flow financing - educational materials, building operations and supplies, marketing and staff salaries - is provided by the sale of donated vehicles, many of which are repaired by the students in training.|$|R
40|$|From 2007 to 2010, the Netherlands {{experienced}} the largest reported Q fever outbreak, with> 4, 000 notified cases. We showed previously that C-reactive protein {{is the only}} traditional infectionmarker reflecting disease activity in acute Q fever. Interleu-kin- 6 is the principal inducer of C-reactive protein. We questioned whether increased C-reactive protein levels in acute Q fever patients coincide with increased interleukin- 6 levels and if these levels correlate with the Coxiella burnetiiDNA load in serum. In addition, we studied their correlation with disease severity, <b>expressed</b> by hospital <b>admission</b> {{and the development of}} fatigue. Interleukin- 6 and C-reactive protein levels were analyzed in sera from 102 patients diagnosed with seronegative PCR-positive acute Q fever. Significant but weak negative correlations were observed between bacterial DNA loads expressed as cycle thresh-old values and interleukin- 6 and C-reactive protein levels, while a significant moderate-strong positive correlation was present between interleukin- 6 and C-reactive protein levels. Furthermore, significantly higher interleukin- 6 and C-reactive protein lev-els were observed in hospitalized acute Q fever patients in comparison to those in nonhospitalized patients, while bacterial DNA loads were the same in the two groups. Nomarker was prognostic for the development of fatigue. In conclusion, the correlation between interleukin- 6 and C-reactive protein levels in acute Q fever patients points to an immune activation pathway in whic...|$|R
40|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} (CVDs) pose a major burden in Africa, but data on temporal {{trends in}} disease burden are lacking. We assessed trends in CVD admissions and outcomes in central Ghana using {{a retrospective analysis}} of data from January 2004 to December 2015 among patients admitted to the medical wards of a tertiary medical center in Kumasi, Ghana. Rates of admissions and mortality were <b>expressed</b> as CVD <b>admissions</b> and deaths divided {{by the total number}} of medical admissions and deaths, respectively. Case fatality rates per specific cardiac disease diagnosis were also computed. Over the period, there were 4226 CVD admissions, with a male-to-female ratio of 1. 1 to 1. There was a progressive increase in percentage of CVD admissions from 4. 6 % to 8. 2 %, representing an 78 % increase, between 2004 and 2014. Of the 2170 CVD cases whose data were available, the top 3 causes of CVD admissions were heart failure (HF; 88. 3 %), ischemic heart disease (IHD; 7. 2 %), and dysrhythmias (1. 9 %). Of all HF admissions, 52 % were associated with hypertension. IHD prevalence rose by 250 % between 2005 and 2015. There were 976 deaths (23 %), with an increase in percentage of hospital deaths that were cardiovascular in nature from 3. 6 % to 7. 3 % between 2004 and 2014, representing a 102 % increase. Cardiac disease admissions and mortality have increased progressively over the past decade, with HF as the most common cause of admission.

40|$|Severe trauma induces a {{widespread}} {{response of the}} immune system. This "genomic storm" can lead to poor outcomes, including Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS). MODS carries a high mortality and morbidity rate and adversely affects long-term health outcomes. Contemporary management of MODS is entirely supportive, and no specific therapeutics {{have been shown to}} be effective in reducing incidence or severity. The pathogenesis of MODS remains unclear, and several models are proposed, such as excessive inflammation, a second-hit insult, or an imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways. We postulated that the hyperacute window after trauma may hold the key to understanding how the genomic storm is initiated and may lead to a new understanding of the pathogenesis of MODS. We performed whole blood transcriptome and flow cytometry analyses on a total of 70 critically injured patients (Injury Severity Score [ISS] ≥ 25) at The Royal London Hospital in the hyperacute time period within 2 hours of injury. We compared transcriptome findings in 36 critically injured patients with those of 6 patients with minor injuries (ISS ≤ 4). We then performed flow cytometry analyses in 34 critically injured patients and compared findings with those of 9 healthy volunteers. Immediately after injury, only 1, 239 gene transcripts (4 %) were differentially expressed in critically injured patients. By 24 hours after injury, 6, 294 transcripts (21 %) were differentially expressed compared to the hyperacute window. Only 202 (16 %) genes differentially expressed in the hyperacute window were still expressed in the same direction at 24 hours postinjury. Pathway analysis showed principally up-regulation of pattern recognition and innate inflammatory pathways, with down-regulation of adaptive responses. Immune deconvolution, flow cytometry, and modular analysis suggested a central role for neutrophils and Natural Killer (NK) cells, with underexpression of T- and B cell responses. In the transcriptome cohort, 20 critically injured patients later developed MODS. Compared with the 16 patients who did not develop MODS (NoMODS), maximal differential expression was seen within the hyperacute window. In MODS versus NoMODS, 363 genes were differentially <b>expressed</b> on <b>admission,</b> compared to only 33 at 24 hours postinjury. MODS transcripts differentially expressed in the hyperacute window showed enrichment among diseases and biological functions associated with cell survival and organismal death rather than inflammatory pathways. There was differential up-regulation of NK cell signalling pathways and markers in patients who would later develop MODS, with down-regulation of neutrophil deconvolution markers. This study is limited by its sample size, precluding more detailed analyses of drivers of the hyperacute response and different MODS phenotypes, and requires validation in other critically injured cohorts. In this study, we showed how the hyperacute postinjury time window contained a focused, specific signature of the response to critical injury that led to widespread genomic activation. A transcriptomic signature for later development of MODS was present in this hyperacute window; it showed a strong signal for cell death and survival pathways and implicated NK cells and neutrophil populations in this differential response...|$|R

However, there are few data on the costs and outcomes of urgent assessment and treatment after the onset of transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke. The Early use of eXisting PREventive Strategies for Stroke (EXPRESS) study showed that urgent assessment and treatment reduced the 90 -day risk of recurrent stroke by about 80 %. We now report the effect of the <b>EXPRESS</b> intervention on <b>admissions</b> to hospital, costs, and disability. METHODS: EXPRESS was a prospective population-based before (phase 1 : April 1, 2002, to Sept 30, 2004) versus after (phase 2 : Oct 1, 2004, to March 31, 2007) study of the effect of early assessment and treatment of TIA or minor stroke on the risk of early recurrent stroke. This report assesses the effect of the introduction of the phase 2 clinic on admissions to hospital within 90 days, hospital bed-days, hospital costs, and 6 -month new disability (progression from no disability before event [modified Rankin scale score 2 points]) or death, compared with the phase 1 clinic. To assess the main predictors of these outcomes, multivariate regression analyses were done. FINDINGS: The 90 -day risk of fatal or disabling stroke was reduced in phase 2 (1 of 281 vs 16 of 310; p= 0. 0005). Hospital admissions for recurrent stroke were also lower in phase 2 than in phase 1 (5 vs 25; p= 0. 001), which reduced the overall number of hospital bed-days compared with phase 1 (672 vs 1957 days; p= 0. 017). Hospital bed-days for admissions to hospital due to vascular causes were also lower in phase 2 (427 vs 1365 days; p= 0. 016), which generated savings of 624 pounds per patient referred to the phase 2 clinic (p= 0. 028). Results from the multivariate analyses showed that assessment in phase 2 was an independent predictor of reduced disability, days in hospital, and costs.

40|$|Diabetes Mellitus is {{currently}} {{a leading cause of}} morbidity and mortality throughout the world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where a significant proportion of diabetes cases are now found. Longitudinal profiling of in-patient admissions and mortality trends from diabetes provide useful insights into the magnitude of the burden of diabetes, serve as a sentinel on the state of out-patient diabetes care and provide effective tools for planning, delivering and evaluating the health care needs relating to the disease in sub-Saharan Africa. To evaluate the 31 -year trend in diabetic admissions and mortality rates in central Ghana. This is a retrospective analysis of data on diabetes admissions and deaths at a tertiary referral hospital in central Ghana between 1983 and 2014. Rates of diabetes admissions or deaths were <b>expressed</b> as diabetes <b>admissions</b> or deaths divided {{by the total number of}} admissions or deaths respectively. Yearly crude fatality rates for diabetes were calculated. Trends were analysed for in patient diabetes admissions and mortality for the period. Predictors of diabetes mortality were determined using multiple logistic regression. A total of 11, 414 diabetes patients were admitted over the period with a female predominance; female:male ratio of 1. 3 : 1. 0. Over the study period, diabetes admission rates increased significantly from 2. 36 per 1000 admissions in 1983 to 14. 94 per 1000 admissions in 2014 (p 80 years compared with < 20 years, admissions in 2000 s compared to 1980 s-aOR of 1. 56 (1. 21 - 2. 01), male gender-aOR of 1. 45 (1. 19 - 1. 61), the presence of glycemic complications such as ketoacidosis- aOR- 2. 67 (CI: 2. 21 - 3. 21), hyperosmolar hyperglycemic states- aOR 1. 52 (1. 33 - 1. 73) symptomatic hypoglycemia- aOR 1. 64 (1. 24 - 2. 17) and presence of end organ complications including peripheral neuropathic ulcers- aOR 1. 31 (1. 12 - 1. 56), nephropathy- aOR - 1. 11 (1. 03 - 1. 23), cerebrovascular disease-aOR- 1. 52 (1. 32 - 1. 98), coronary artery disease- aOR- 3. 21 (1. 91 - 5. 15) and peripheral artery disease- aOR- 1. 15 (1. 12 - 1. 21) were associated with increased risk of death compared with normoglycemic diabetic admissions and admissions without end organ complications respectively.
