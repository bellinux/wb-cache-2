50|$|Generally, {{interested}} candidates {{apply for}} federal clerkships roughly {{a year before}} the clerkship begins. Thus, many law students tend to apply early in the fall of their third year. The federal clerkship application process has also largely been streamlined by the National <b>Federal</b> <b>Judges</b> Law Clerk Hiring Plan and the OSCAR system, an online database in which <b>federal</b> <b>judges</b> post upcoming vacancies (although not all <b>federal</b> <b>judges</b> use this system). The National <b>Federal</b> <b>Judges</b> Law Clerk Hiring Plan sets dates for when <b>federal</b> <b>judges</b> may receive applications, and when they may contact, interview, and hire law clerks. Generally, judges begin looking at applications in the early fall, with contact and interviews happening a few weeks later. These dates only apply to the hiring of matriculating third-year law students; practicing attorneys may apply earlier. Moreover, while many judges adhere to the National <b>Federal</b> <b>Judges</b> Law Clerk Hiring Plan's schedule, many do not follow the plan and interview and hire law students over the summer. The Supreme Court does not follow this timetable.|$|R
