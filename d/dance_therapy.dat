In 2010, he {{took part in}} a charity event named Superstars Ka Jalwa, which helped generate money for the employees of the Cine and Television Artists Association (CINTAA). Also that year, he lent his support to the NGO Swayamsiddh, which helps children with special needs. The following year, he adopted three villages in support of NDTV's Greenathon, an initiative to support environmental consciousness and improve electricity supplies to rural areas. In 2012, Kapoor helped revive the Victory Arts Foundation NGO, founded by Shiamak Davar, which helps underprivileged children through <b>dance</b> <b>therapy</b> programs.

He supports the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals organisation through advertisement campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Lohan {{visits the}} Sanlaap centre, a women's and children's shelter in Kolkata. The centre offers <b>dance</b> <b>therapy</b> {{as part of}} their {{treatment}} and a group of girls perform a dance they have rehearsed. She talks to girls who had been held at a brothel and they describe being raped and drugged. The director of the Sanlaap centre describes how Lohan taking an interest in trafficking might inspire other young people to get involved in counteracting exploitation. Bharti Ali, director of the Non-governmental organization Centre for Child Rights, criticizes the government for not prioritizing child protection. Returning home, Lohan and the film crew are chased by paparazzi photographers at the airport. Two months later, Lohan is in London, England talking to Kate Redman, from Save the Children UK, who describes how one of the issues with government intervention is that only sex and drug trafficking is illegal. She also advocates raising awareness of the issues with trafficking.|$|E
25|$|The broader {{concept of}} group therapy {{can be taken}} to include any helping process that takes place in a group, {{including}} support groups, skills training groups (such as anger management, mindfulness, relaxation training or social skills training), and psychoeducation groups. The differences between psychodynamic groups, activity groups, support groups, problem-solving and psycoeducational groups have been discussed by psychiatrist Charles Montgomery. Other, more specialised forms of group therapy would include non-verbal expressive therapies such as art therapy, <b>dance</b> <b>therapy,</b> or music therapy.|$|E

40|$|The master thesis {{discusses}} {{the areas of}} dance and <b>dance</b> movement <b>therapy.</b> Moreover it presents {{an overview of the}} artistic dance, which is applied for therapeutic treatment purposes. Furthermore, it defines concepts and dance genres that are present within different <b>dance</b> movement <b>therapy</b> approaches. <b>Dance</b> description is further elaborated in those chapters dedicated to the understanding and development of <b>dance</b> movement <b>therapy.</b> The thesis presents different dance genres and forms, which are nowadays frequently used within <b>dance</b> movement <b>therapy</b> (ballet, buto, contact improvisation, expression primitive – primitive expression, oriental dances, social dances, tango, creative movement, modern dance) as well as their application for the purposes of <b>dance</b> movement <b>therapy,</b> where I provide an explanation on how has dance contributed to its development. The research provides an overview of the <b>dance</b> movement <b>therapy</b> in Europe, additionally it presents some examples and influences from other continents, namely America, Africa and the Far East. Along with the overview I described different dance genres and their usefulness in various <b>dance</b> movement <b>therapy</b> approaches. Furthermore the research {{discusses the}} differences between various approaches by taking into consideration and confronting the historical development of the discipline of <b>dance</b> movement <b>therapy,</b> which is a young discipline yet widely spread throughout the world. Dance changes through time and space, and so does also the <b>dance</b> movement <b>therapy.</b> On the basis of the examined literature I described the differences between the concept of dance, which is used for therapeutic purposes, and the <b>dance</b> movement <b>therapy.</b> Furthermore, I reviewed and presented the field of <b>dance</b> movement <b>therapy</b> and prepared an insight into different fields of dance and dance genres within the chapters, which are related to the understanding and development of <b>dance</b> movement <b>therapy.</b> The thesis presents modern approaches to <b>dance</b> movement <b>therapy</b> and describes new findings in the field of neuroscience, specifically on how a dance movement therapist stimulates the neuroplasticity process activation in a particular patient’s brain. This can be done by identifying how a person moves and by encouraging this person to enrich his or her movement pattern. I also described the anthropological approach, which assigns a major role to the person’s “dance identity”. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} the application of <b>dance</b> movement <b>therapy</b> with elderly people with certain limitations. The aim of the thesis is to describe the effects of <b>dance</b> movement <b>therapy</b> on elderly {{people who suffer from}} neurodegenerative diseases - Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. The thesis also points to the fact that although the <b>dance</b> movement <b>therapy</b> is a very suitable supplementary method of elderly people care, it does not get much attention in the Czech Republic, compared to other countries where the <b>dance</b> movement <b>therapy</b> is being used quite a lot (USA, United Kingdom). The thesis draws on theoretical findings in professional literature and includes practical information gained by the form of semi-structured interviews with professionals - dance therapists, for many years dedicated to applying <b>dance</b> movement <b>therapy</b> with elderly people. The aim of the interviews was to find out how a therapist works with a client, and what are the specifics and effects of the <b>dance</b> movement <b>therapy</b> on a specific group of elderly people with whom the therapist works.

50|$|The {{second wave}} of <b>Dance</b> Movement <b>Therapy</b> came around the 1970s to the 1980s and it sparked much {{interest}} from American therapists.

However, the relationship between DMT and contemporary educational theory, particularly the recently acknowledged link between learning and wellbeing has not yet been properly explicated. This chapter addresses this issue by examining how DMT programs in special education can contribute to student wellbeing and, therefore, learning. The practice of creative educational dance, the philosophy underpinning existential phenomenology and influential ideas from education on relational learning and constructivist pedagogies are discussed with regard to the way they inform <b>dance</b> movement <b>therapy</b> for this client group.

40|$|This {{qualitative}} {{study was designed}} to investigate the phenomenon of kinesthetic empathy {{and its impact on the}} inner experience of <b>dance</b> movement <b>therapy</b> workshops’ participants. In <b>dance</b> movement <b>therapy,</b> kinesthetic empathy is seen as a catalyst of positive change in the client, but in practice it is still a very poorly understood phenomenon. Four students of expressive arts therapies attended four experimental <b>dance</b> movement <b>therapy</b> workshops, where the greatest emphasis was on the process of mutual attunement. All workshops were video recorded. Based on video movement analysis, key moments of nonverbal attunement and non-attunement were chosen, and then analyzed within group interviews with participants. The results of this study show that successful attunement in <b>dance</b> movement <b>therapy</b> draws the client’s attention to the present moment, it encourages individual spontaneity, playfulness and creativity, promotes embodiment and thus the integration of mind and body. Successful attunement with another leads to intersubjective exchange, where two people co-create an intersubjective experience. Successful attunement with the group leads to the experience of oneness. Moments of non-attunement trigger unpleasant feelings, result in lack of spontaneity, feelings of exclusion and hinder the contact. The study’s results also show the connection between the characteristics of inner experience of attunement with the inner experience of the present moment in dance. On this basis, the model of experiencing the present moment in dance was designed, which outlines in detail these connections...|$|R
