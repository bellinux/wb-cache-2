6000|$|Newman, with a steadfast and {{immovable}} aspect, and his <b>fixed</b> <b>eye</b> very fixed indeed, replied, suiting {{the action}} to the word, 'A letter. From Mr Nickleby. Bearer waits.' ...|$|E
60|$|With that he {{regarded}} her attentively with his <b>fixed</b> <b>eye,</b> surveyed his company with his loose one, kissed her, shook his head, {{and handed her}} to Mr. Gradgrind as to a horse.|$|E
60|$|The {{wife was}} advancing, but Vivian {{waved his hand}} to her to withdraw, and she {{accordingly}} fell into the background; but her <b>fixed</b> <b>eye</b> did not leave her husband for a second.|$|E
60|$|The girl paused with <b>fixed</b> <b>eyes</b> {{that saw}} nothing. Merton watched her. Then {{she took her}} resolve.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} the face with the <b>fixed</b> <b>eyes,</b> set before her, and her blood ran cold.|$|R
60|$|Pearce and Cleve gazed with <b>fixed</b> <b>eyes,</b> and, however {{different}} their emotions, they rivaled {{each other}} in attention.|$|R
60|$|The Sleary {{philosophy}} was propounded {{as they went}} downstairs and the <b>fixed</b> <b>eye</b> of Philosophy - and its rolling eye, too - soon lost the three figures and the basket {{in the darkness of}} the street.|$|E
6000|$|... "I pray {{you that}} you will order the Company to lie down," [...] cried Hawtayne, who had taken the tiller and was gazing ahead with a <b>fixed</b> <b>eye.</b> [...] "In three minutes we shall either be lost or in safety." ...|$|E
60|$|While Scott was reading, {{the sage}} grimalkin, already mentioned, {{had taken his}} seat in a chair beside the fire, and {{remained}} with <b>fixed</b> <b>eye</b> and grave demeanor, as if listening to the reader. I observed to Scott that his cat {{seemed to have a}} black-letter taste in literature.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I must {{be alone}} when I receive this letter. Stay here.' And with {{compressed}} lips and <b>fixed</b> <b>eyes</b> he stalked {{out at the}} door, and shut it.|$|R
6000|$|They both hurried up, and {{the mother}} again peered out with <b>fixed</b> <b>eyes.</b> The Captain tried to comfort her; laying his strong hand on her shoulder, he said: ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{gazed at}} me with <b>fixed</b> <b>eyes.</b> 'Yes, mademoiselle,' he answered, in quite a {{different}} and markedly chilly voice. 'Whatever your great country attempts--were it only a fog--it achieves consummately.' ...|$|R
60|$|Last of all {{appeared}} Mr. Sleary: a stout man {{as already}} mentioned, with one <b>fixed</b> <b>eye,</b> and one loose eye, a voice (if {{it can be}} called so) like the efforts of a broken old pair of bellows, a flabby surface, and a muddled head which was never sober and never drunk.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I know, Madame--I {{know from}} an eye-witness,' said Eustacie, firmly. 'I know the brutal words that embittered my husband's death; and were there no other cause, they would render wedlock with him who spoke them sacrilege.' Resolutely and {{steadily}} did the young wife speak, {{looking at them}} with the dry <b>fixed</b> <b>eye</b> to which tears had been denied ever since that eventful night.' ...|$|E
6000|$|O meek {{attendant}} of Sol's setting blaze, [...] I hail, sweet star, thy chaste effulgent glow; [...] On thee full oft with <b>fix√©d</b> <b>eye</b> I gaze [...] Till I, methinks, all spirit seem to grow. [...] O {{first and}} fairest of the starry choir, [...] 5 [...] O loveliest 'mid {{the daughters of}} the night, [...] Must not the maid I love like thee inspire [...] Pure joy and calm Delight? ...|$|E
60|$|Ahab {{crossed the}} deck to gaze {{over on the}} other side; but started at two reflected, <b>fixed</b> <b>eyes</b> in the water there, Fedallah was motionlessly leaning over the same rail.|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} a pale shadow flickered on Leo's face, such a shadow as might fall from Death's {{advancing}} wing, {{and in the}} <b>fixed</b> <b>eyes</b> of the Shaman there shone a stony smile.|$|R
60|$|He {{would lay}} down the book without a word, and take up Smith's Wealth of Nations or Smollett's England--the {{profitable}} studies recommended, and speedily become lost in a dejected reverie, with <b>fixed</b> <b>eyes</b> and drooping lips.|$|R
60|$|There was no answer, but Honor had learnt by {{experience}} that to insist was apt {{to end in}} obtaining nothing but a collision of wills, and she merely put out the Prayer Books for the morning's reading of the Psalms. By {{the time it was}} over, Lucilla's fit of temper had past, and she leant back in her chair. 'What are you listening to, Lucy?' said Honor, seeing her <b>fixed</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
6000|$|A minute past, and she {{had been}} all tears, [...] And tenderness, and infancy; but now [...] She stood as one who championed human fears-- [...] Pale, statue-like, and stern, she wooed the blow; [...] And tall beyond her sex, and their compeers, [...] She drew up to her height, as if to show [...] A fairer mark; and with a <b>fixed</b> <b>eye</b> scanned [...] Her Father's face--but never stopped his hand.|$|E
60|$|Christine mounted her mule, in {{obedience}} to her brother's desire, quietly, and without remonstrance; but her death-like countenance and <b>fixed</b> <b>eye</b> betrayed {{the violence of}} the shock she had received. During the whole of the ride to the convent she spoke not, and, as those around her felt for, and understood, her distress, the little cavalcade {{could not have been more}} melancholy and silent had it borne with it the body of the slain. In an hour they reached the long sought for and so anxiously desired place of rest.|$|E
60|$|It was evening now on earth, {{and morning}} {{on the top of}} the hill in Purgatory, when Beatrice having <b>fixed</b> her <b>eyes</b> upon the sun, Dante <b>fixed</b> his <b>eyes</b> upon hers, and {{suddenly}} found himself in Heaven.|$|R
6000|$|... "When great O'Connle died, [...] That {{man whom}} all did trust, [...] That man whom Henglish pride [...] Beheld with such disgust, [...] Then Erin free <b>fixed</b> <b>eyes</b> on me, [...] And swoar I should be fust.|$|R
50|$|The emblem {{represents}} an argent lion, with <b>fixed</b> <b>eyes</b> and claws of or, on azure. It is {{the arms of}} the Lords of Enn who built the Castle in the twelfth century. The emblem was granted in 1967.|$|R
60|$|He {{embraced her}} fervently, muffled himself as before, and {{accompanied}} Varney from the apartment. The latter, {{as he left}} the room, bowed low, and as he raised his body, regarded Amy with a peculiar expression, as if he desired to know how far his own pardon was included in the reconciliation which had taken place betwixt her and her lord. The Countess looked upon him with a <b>fixed</b> <b>eye,</b> but seemed no more conscious of his presence than if there had been nothing but vacant air on the spot where he stood.|$|E
60|$|The poor {{creature}} {{then got}} on the quarter of the boat, without any one's touching her; there she placed herself with her legs outboard, while {{she sat on the}} gunwale. She gave one moment to the thought of arranging her clothes with womanly decency, and then she paused to gaze with a <b>fixed</b> <b>eye,</b> and pallid cheek, on the foaming wake that marked the rapid course of the boat. The troughs of the sea seemed less terrible to her than their combing crests, and she waited for the boat to descend into the next.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, 'twas as neat {{a bit of}} {{stitching}} as ever I heard of,' {{continued the}} clerk, with a <b>fixed</b> <b>eye,</b> {{as if he were}} watching the process from a distance. 'Not a soul knew anything about it, and my wife is the only one in our parish who knows it yet. Miss Hinton came back from the wedden, went to Mr. Manston, puffed herself out large, and said she was Mrs. Bollens, but that if he wished, she had no objection to keep on the house till the regular time of giving notice had expired, or till he could get another tenant.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{all looked}} at one another in silence, we clasped each other's hands. Motionless, with <b>fixed</b> <b>eyes,</b> we gazed on the {{pavement}} of our prison; on which lay the moonlight, checkered with the triple stancheons of our windows.|$|R
60|$|The monstrous {{thought came}} into my mind, as I perused the <b>fixed</b> <b>eyes</b> and the saturnine face, {{that this was a}} spirit, not a man. I have speculated since, whether there may have been {{infection}} in his mind.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Brock {{looked at}} her white face and <b>fixed</b> <b>eyes</b> with a grim kind of curiosity. The Count sputtered, and cursed the horrid taste of the punch still; but he {{presently}} took the box, and made his threatened throw.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, dear! {{that poor}} old woman!" [...] {{continued}} Miss Todd. [...] "You know one lives in constant fear of her having a fit. Miss Ruff is horrible. She {{has a way}} of looking with that <b>fixed</b> <b>eye</b> of hers that is almost worse than her voice." [...] The fact was, that Miss Ruff had one glass eye. [...] "I know she'll be the death of that poor old creature some of these days. Lady Ruth will play, and she hardly knows one card from another. And then Miss Ruff, she will scold. Good heavens! do you hear that?" ...|$|E
60|$|As {{the good}} {{servitor}} fumbled {{for a moment}} among the napkins, as if unwilling to stir so summarily from his accustomed duty, and not without some of a well and long-tried old domestic's vague, intermitted murmuring, at being wholly excluded from a matter of family interest; Mrs. Glendinning kept her <b>fixed</b> <b>eye</b> on Pierre, who, unmindful that the breakfast was not yet entirely ready, seating himself at the table, began helping himself--though but nervously enough--to the cream and sugar. The moment the door closed on Dates, the mother sprang to her feet, and {{threw her arms around}} her son; but in that embrace, Pierre miserably felt that their two hearts beat not together in such unison as before.|$|E
60|$|Presently I saw {{a funeral}} train {{moving across the}} village green; it wound slowly along a lane, was lost, and reappeared through the breaks of the hedges, until it passed the place where I was sitting. The pall was {{supported}} by young girls dressed in white, and another, {{about the age of}} seventeen, walked before, bearing a chaplet of white flowers--a token that the deceased was a young and unmarried female. The corpse was followed by the parents. They were a venerable couple of the better order of peasantry. The father seemed to repress his feelings, but his <b>fixed</b> <b>eye,</b> contracted brow, and deeply-furrowed face showed the struggle that was passing within. His wife hung on his arm, and wept aloud with the convulsive bursts of a mother's sorrow.|$|E
6000|$|Bourb. They do not menace me. I {{could have}} faced, [...] Methinks, a Sylla's menace; but they clasp, [...] And raise, and wring their dim and deathlike hands, [...] And with their thin aspen faces and <b>fixed</b> <b>eyes</b> [...] Fascinate mine. Look there! ...|$|R
60|$|He stopped, out of breath, with <b>fixed</b> <b>eyes</b> and a rigid mouth. Father Esteban drew a snuff-box {{from his}} pocket, {{and a large}} handkerchief. After blowing his nose violently, he took a pinch of snuff, wiped his lip, and {{replaced}} the box.|$|R
50|$|Disappearing line: The {{patient may}} {{report that they}} see one line, then the lines switch and they can only see the other line. This {{is the case in}} an {{alternating}} deviation, where there is always one eye suppressing, however the <b>fixing</b> <b>eye</b> is switching.|$|R
