Assoc. 88 (1993) 252 [...] 260] {{as an extension}} of the Wilcoxon rank sum statistic for univariate data has been used in multivariate rank tests in quality control and in <b>experimental</b> <b>studies.</b> <b>Those</b> applications, however, are based on a conjectured limiting distribution, provided by Liu and Singh [J.

The present paper proves the conjecture under general regularity conditions and, therefore, validates various applications of the rank sum statistic in the literature. The paper also shows that the corresponding rank sum tests can be more powerful than Hotelling's T^ 2 test and some commonly used multivariate rank tests in detecting location-scale changes in multivariate distributions.

Although theoretically any organism {{could be used for}} <b>experimental</b> evolution <b>studies,</b> <b>those</b> with rapid generation times, high mutation rates, large population sizes, and small sizes increase the feasibility of <b>experimental</b> <b>studies</b> in a laboratory context. For these reasons, bacteriophages (i.e. viruses that infect bacteria) are especially favored by experimental evolutionary biologists. Bacteriophages, and microbial organisms, can be frozen in stasis, facilitating comparison of evolved strains to ancestors. Additionally, microbes are especially labile from a molecular biologic perspective. Many molecular tools have been developed to manipulate the genetic material of microbial organisms, and because of their small genome sizes, sequencing the full genomes of evolved strains is trivial. Therefore, comparisons can be made for the exact molecular changes in evolved strains during adaptation to novel conditions.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the application of}} Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) to the internal flows within turbomachines. In particular, the work sought to investigate whether LES could give an improved predictive tool for flows through a turbine rim seal where other methods of modelling turbulence give disappointing results for the simulation of hot annulus gas ingestion into the rim seal cavity. The applicability of LES to flow regimes within a rotor-stator cavity were investigated with reference to two <b>experimental</b> <b>studies,</b> <b>those</b> of Daily & Nece [1] and of Itoh et al. [2]. LES simulations were run using the commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code FLUENT and the Rolls-Royce CFD code HYDRA. Both gave good agreement for the velocity field even when the boundary layer was not fully resolved. HYDRA was then used to simulate a turbine rim seal cavity with external flow through an annulus with NGV and rotor blades, modelled using a small sector with periodic boundary conditions in the circumferential direction. LES was found to predict higher levels of ingestion than Unsteady Reynolds- Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations {{at a number of}} different values of cavity throughflow. This resulted in better, but not close, agreement with the experiments of Gentilhomme [3]. The sensitivity of the LES to changes {{in the size of the}} sector and to the resolution of the CFD grid were investigated. A larger sector simulation, corresponding to 40 °, gave almost identical results to those on the smaller sector, 13. 3 °. Refinement to the CFD grid did lead to different results, particularly in the annulus flow, though critically the prediction of ingestion in the stator boundary layer was largely unaffected.

40|$|Knowledge of the {{energetic}} state of tissue {{is required in}} a wide range of <b>experimental</b> <b>studies,</b> particularly <b>those</b> investigating the decline and recovery of cellular metabolism after metabolic stress. Such information can be obtained from high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) determination of tissue levels of adenine nucleotides (ATP, ADP, and AMP) and their interrelationship in the tissue energy charge (EC). Accordingly, a large range of techniques with which to measure these molecules and their downstream metabolites have been reported. However, the accurate determination of the tissue EC also depends on the nucleotide extraction procedure given that changes in adenine nucleotide levels take place very quickly when ATPases are not inactivated immediately. In this article, we describe all ion-pair reversed-phase HPLC method by which separation of adenine nucleotides can be performed rapidly, allowing multiple analyses in 1 day, with both high sensitivity and extraction efficiency and using fresh samples, thereby avoiding freeze-thaw degradation of nucleotides. We applied this method to hippocampal brain slice extracts and show that same-day extraction and analysis results ill a more accurate determination of the in situ energetic state than does the commonly used snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen.
