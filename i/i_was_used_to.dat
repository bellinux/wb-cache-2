25|$|In {{the time}} of Elizabeth I, the {{persecution}} of the adherents of the Reformed religion, both Anglicans and Protestants alike, which had occurred {{during the reign of}} her elder half-sister Queen Mary <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> fuel strong anti-Catholic propaganda in the hugely influential Foxe's Book of Martyrs. Those who had died in Mary's reign, under the Marian Persecutions, were effectively canonised by this work of hagiography. In 1571 the Convocation of the Church of England ordered that copies of the Book of Martyrs should be kept for public inspection in all cathedrals and in the houses of church dignitaries. The book was also displayed in many Anglican parish churches alongside the Holy Bible. The passionate intensity of its style and its vivid and picturesque dialogues made the book very popular among Puritan and Low Church families, Anglican and Protestant nonconformist, down to the nineteenth century. In a period of extreme partisanship on all sides of the religious debate, the exaggeratedly partisan church history of the earlier portion of the book, with its grotesque stories of popes and monks, contributed to fuel anti-Catholic prejudices in England, as did the story of the sufferings of several hundred Reformers (both Anglican and Protestant) who had been burnt at the stake under Mary and Bishop Bonner.|$|E

At the 1995 Source Awards, OutKast {{won in the}} [...] "Best Newcomer" [...] category, but were booed upon taking the stage and delivering their acceptance speech; Big Boi managed to deliver his shout outs, while André 3000 was nervous and only said, [...] "The South got somethin' to say." [...] The latter recalled how the album was received by some listeners, [...] "People thought that the South basically only had bass music. At first people were looking at us like 'Um, I don't know.'" [...] Hip hop magnate Russell Simmons reacted negatively to the album at the time, but later expressed regret and said of the album in retrospect, [...] "At the time, I didn't understand their music—it sounds so different from what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> that I foolishly... claim that they 'weren't hip-hop.' The same way people didn't understand 'Sucker MCs' a decade earlier, I didn't understand that instead of operating outside of hip-hop, OutKast was actually expanding hip-hop.
