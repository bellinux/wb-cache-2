5|$|From March 2013, {{concerns}} over further currency war diminished, though in November several journalists and analysts warned {{of a possible}} fresh outbreak. The likely principal source of tension appeared to shift once again, this time not being the U.S. versus China or the Eurozone versus Japan, but the U.S. versus Germany. In late October U.S. treasury officials had criticized Germany for running an excessively large current account surplus, thus acting as a <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> global economy.|$|E
5|$|Muskrats {{are covered}} with short, thick fur, which is medium to dark brown or black in color, with the belly a bit lighter (countershaded); as the age increases, it turns a partly gray in color. The fur has two layers, which helps {{protect them from the}} cold water. They have long tails covered with scales rather than hair, and to aid them in swimming, are {{slightly}} flattened vertically, which is a shape that is unique to them. When they walk on land, their tails <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, which makes their tracks easy to recognize.|$|E

5|$|New York Dolls is the 1973 debut studio album by the American {{hard rock}} band New York Dolls. By {{the time of}} the album's recording, the band had {{developed}} a following by playing regularly in lower Manhattan after forming in 1971. However, they were unappealing to record companies because of their onstage cross-dressing and vulgarity, while most record producers were reluctant to work with them. For shock value, the group was photographed in exaggerated <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> album cover.|$|E
5|$|The Pakistani negotiators {{inadvertently}} {{reveal the}} name of radio engineer Ali, whom the hijackers bring to the cockpit to use the radio for negotiations. Meanwhile, the Pakistani authorities try to stall for time. When a younger terrorist assaults the passengers and molests the attendants, the terrorist leader chastises him; humiliated, the younger terrorist storms into the cockpit and shoots Ali, screaming wild threats over the radio. While negotiations with the Pakistani air controllers <b>drag</b> <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> negotiators slowly lose control of the situation, with the hijackers becoming more agitated by the minute.|$|E
5|$|While these {{guns were}} {{considered}} an improvement by the Navy over {{that of the}} South Carolinas, their placement remained problematic as even in calm water, they were extremely wet and thus difficult to man. The forward guns were moved into the superstructure after sea trials. The casemate-mounted secondary armament was one deck below the main deck and provided {{the majority of the}} complaints from shipping water from the forward positions and breaking the flow of the bow wave imparting extra <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> design.|$|E

5|$|Experience with {{previous}} battlecruiser designs {{led to the}} adoption of a continuous upper deck, which raised the level of the deck aft. This was necessary because the aft decks of earlier designs were usually awash when steaming at high speed, even in calm seas. The ships were also equipped with a bulbous bow to reduce <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hull, the first time the feature was used in the German Navy. The ships as designed required a crew of 46 officers and 1,140 enlisted sailors. Service as a squadron flagship would increase that number by an additional 14 officers and 62 sailors. The vessels carried a number of small boats, including two picket boats, one barge, two launches, two cutters, and three yawls.|$|E

25|$|On August 21, 1995, one of {{the blades}} on Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 529's number-one {{propeller}} sheared off, partly tearing the left engine from its mount and increasing <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left side. It crashed in a field near Carrollton, Georgia. Of the twenty-nine people on board, ten died (one casualty was {{from a heart attack}} nearly 8 weeks after the accident).|$|E
25|$|Islamic sumptuary {{laws are}} based upon teachings found in the Quran and Hadith. Males are exhorted not to wear silk clothes, nor have jewelry made of gold. Likewise, wearing clothes or robes that <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, seen {{as a sign of}} vanity and {{excessive}} pride, are also forbidden. These rules do not apply to women, who are allowed all this.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the human}} body is only {{slightly}} less dense than water, water supports the weight of the body during swimming. As a result, swimming is “low-impact” compared to land activities such as running. The density and viscosity of water also create resistance for objects moving through the water. Swimming strokes use this resistance to create propulsion, but this same resistance also generates <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> body.|$|E

25|$|A wing {{is a type}} of fin that {{produces}} lift, while moving through air or some other fluid. As such, wings have streamlined cross-sections that are subject to aerodynamic forces and act as an airfoils. A wing's aerodynamic efficiency is expressed as its lift-to-drag ratio. The lift a wing generates at a given speed and angle of attack can be one to two orders of magnitude greater than the total <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wing. A high lift-to-drag ratio requires a significantly smaller thrust to propel the wings through the air at sufficient lift.|$|E
25|$|On iPad, a two-finger <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{keyboard}} {{moves the}} cursor freely like a traditional trackpad, making positioning the cursor and selecting text easier. The keyboard-to-trackpad feature is also extended to iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, in which users can 3D Touch (force press) the keyboard {{to enable the}} trackpad. Also on the iPad, a shortcut bar has been added for cut, copy, paste, undo and redo functions, and folders display 16 apps per page in a 4-by-4 arrangement, compared to 9 on the iPhone, allowing for an increased total of 240 apps in a single folder.|$|E
25|$|To bowl a cutter, the bowler {{employs a}} {{different}} grip. The two grips are {{shown to the}} right, with the uppermost one producing a leg cutter while the lower one shows the grip required for an off cutter. As well as changing the grip, the bowler must pull his or her fingers down the appropriate {{side of the ball}} as it leaves their hand to impart the required spin. The action of bowling a cutter also increases <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ball as it leaves the hand, causing the ball to slow {{in the same way as}} a slower ball and this can also help to confuse the batsman.|$|E

5000|$|Tubes {{used for}} riding on snow are {{sometimes}} specially designed tubes with dimpled centers {{rather than a}} [...] "donut" [...] hole. This prevents the rider and the tube itself from <b>dragging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> snow. Snow tubes may be designed to have handles.|$|R

25|$|The GP-B gyro {{consists}} of a nearly-perfect spherical rotating mass made of fused quartz, which provides a dielectric support for {{a thin layer of}} niobium superconducting material. To eliminate friction found in conventional bearings, the rotor assembly is centered by the electric field from six electrodes. After the initial spin-up by a jet of helium which brings the rotor to 4,000 RPM, the polished gyroscope housing is evacuated to an ultra-high vacuum to further reduce <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rotor. Provided the suspension electronics remain powered, the extreme rotational symmetry, lack of friction, and low drag will allow the angular momentum of the rotor to keep it spinning for about 15,000 years.|$|E
25|$|One of {{a number}} of {{different}} grips is illustrated to the right. Essentially {{the only difference is that}} the middle and index fingers are split and come down on each side of the seam. This causes more <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ball as it leaves the hand, slowing down the delivery. Slower balls are also bowled by using the off break grip and finger action used by off spinners. A slower delivery may also be achieved – less commonly – by using a leg spin grip and wrist action or by supporting the upper aspect of the ball with only one finger or with the knuckles.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1914, Oskar Ursinus, {{the founder}} {{and editor of the}} German flying {{magazine}} Flugsport, began designing a large twin-engine seaplane of unconventional configuration. While most biplane designs have the fuselage attached to the lower wing, Ursinus had a snub-nosed fuselage attached to the upper wing, and twin engine nacelles mounted on the lower one. The purpose of this arrangement was to allow the engines to be kept close together thereby minimizing asymmetrical thrust {{in the event of an}} engine failure, although Ursinus later also claimed that this design balanced out the lowering of the centre of pressure as speed increased, and minimised the <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper wing caused by turbulence from the fuselage.|$|E
