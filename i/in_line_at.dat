5|$|Andrew Prine, {{who played}} Norman Ramsey, wrote the last {{fifth of the}} film because it had no ending. Both Ben Johnson and he were hung over while filming the train scene after partying the night before. During the rain scene with Ramsey, a snake made its way on the set. Crew members were yelling at Andrew {{that it was a}} moccasin, but Prine wanted to finish his scene without reshooting, so the crew killed the snake afterwards. The last shot of the film where the killer is seen {{standing}} <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> the movie theater was Pierce's wife's idea.|$|E
5|$|On May 28, Bonds passed Ruth, {{hitting his}} 715th career home run to center field off Colorado Rockies pitcher Byung-hyun Kim. The ball was hit an {{estimated}} 445feet (140m) into center field where {{it went through}} the hands of several fans but then fell onto an elevated platform in center field. Then it rolled off the platform where Andrew Morbitzer, a 38-year-old San Francisco resident, caught the ball while he was <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> a concession stand. Mysteriously, radio broadcaster Dave Flemming's radio play-by-play of the home run went silent just as the ball was hit, apparently from a microphone failure. But the televised version, called by Giants broadcaster Duane Kuiper, was not affected.|$|E

5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) {{meets his}} girlfriend Elisa's {{grandmother}} (Teresa Yenque). The grandmother {{does not like}} Jack because he reminds her of the Generalissimo, the antagonist from her favorite Mexican telenovela Los Amantes Clandestinos. Jack buys Los Amantes Clandestinos and tries to kill the Generalissimo off, but the actors on the show refuse to cooperate. Jack then meets Hector Moreda (also played by Baldwin), the actor who plays the Generalissimo, and asks why he will not follow the script. According to Hector, {{his role as the}} Generalissimo allows him to cut <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> Disney World, among other perks. Jack shows him a picture of Elisa, explaining that he wants to kill off the character for her. Understanding Jack's feelings, Hector agrees to help Jack by making the character fall in love with an elderly Hispanic woman, thereby winning the affection of Elisa's grandmother. The grandmother subsequently accepts Jack as Elisa's boyfriend, but makes one more request of him: to make NBC News less depressing. Jack responds by airing a montage of pictures of Puerto Rican babies to the music of Tito Puente on The Today Show, much to the displeasure of Matt Lauer.|$|E

According to a {{spokesperson}} for the water park, the man cut <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> the slide, fought through the lifeguards, and jumped onto the slide head-first. The man tumbled onto the slide and slipped over the edge, falling 60 feet onto a fence below the slide tower. The local sheriff's office reported that the man was transported to an area hospital with life-threatening injuries.|$|E
25|$|Production {{and sales}} of neat ethanol {{vehicles}} tumbled beginning in 1987 owing to several factors, including {{a sharp decline in}} gasoline prices {{as a result of the}} 1980s oil glut, and high sugar prices in the world market, shifting sugarcane ethanol production from fuel to sugar. By mid-1989, a shortage of ethanol fuel supply in the local market left thousands of vehicles <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> gas stations or out of fuel in their garages, forcing consumers to abandon ethanol vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Some series use a {{red flag}} when a severe {{accident}} has occurred or to temporarily stop a race {{nearing the end of}} a race. This is usually done when a collision requiring cleanup would otherwise extend the caution period to take longer than the amount of race laps available to finish the race, when a fuel spill occurs on the circuit, or to maximize safety team work. During such a red-flag period, cars are directed to stop <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> a specific point on the track, usually directly opposite to the incident.|$|E

25|$|Raymond J. Place first aroused the {{suspicion}} {{of law enforcement}} officers as he was standing <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> the Miami airport waiting to buy a ticket to New York's LaGuardia Airport. The officers approached {{him on his way}} to the gate and asked him for identification. Place also agreed to let the officers search the luggage he had checked, but they declined to do so in light of the flight's imminent departure. Discrepancies between the two luggage tags on Place's two suitcases further aroused the officers' suspicions, and they confirmed that the addresses were false. The Miami officers alerted DEA agents at LaGuardia to their suspicions about Place.|$|E

Under cover of night, he scaled a nearby fence and hailed a cab to Grand Central Terminal. After stopping in The Bronx to change clothes {{and pick up a}} set of keys to a Montreal bank safe deposit box containing $20,000, Abagnale caught a train to Montreal's Dorval airport to purchase a ticket to São Paulo, Brazil. After a close call at a Mac's Milk, he was apprehended by a constable of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police while standing <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> the ticket counter. Abagnale was subsequently handed over to the U.S. Border Patrol.|$|E
25|$|Before the Confederates could {{approach}} Dagwell and his men, Major Remington {{appeared with}} the rest of the detachment. When informed of the situation, Remington did not try to flee but ordered his men <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> the crest of the hill where Dagwell had viewed the 2,000-man Confederate force. Meanwhile, Stuart had heard about the encounter with his staff officers and ordered Brigadier General Wade Hampton III to bring up the lead regiment quickly to meet the threat. The advance unit of the Confederates, the 1st North Carolina Cavalry, then came over the hill and moved to within 30 yards of the Union line but did not move further forward despite orders which Dagwell could hear. When the Union troops did not surrender after about 15 seconds, the opposing forces began to shoot at each other.|$|E

25|$|At around 1:10p.m., Bryant got <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> {{the toll}} {{booth at the}} {{entrance}} to the historic site. Upon getting close to the toll booth, he left the line and moved to the back again. Eventually getting to the front of the line, he claimed someone had almost reversed into him. He paid the entry fee and proceeded to park near the Broad Arrow Café, near the water's edge. The site security manager told him to park with the other cars because that area was reserved for camper-vans and the car park was very busy that day. Bryant moved his car to another area and sat in his car for a few minutes. He then moved his car back near the water, outside the café. The security manager saw him go up to the café carrying a large bag and a video camera, but ignored him.|$|E
25|$|All Batavian {{activity}} during the main {{phase of the}} battle was therefore on the British right flank, by the Batavian left wing. Here Daendels deployed his forces in three lines, as the front was too narrow to deploy more than two battalions <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> a time. He first had Col. Crass attack with the 1st and 3rd battalions of the 5th Demi-brigade, supported by cavalry and two pieces of horse artillery under Capt. d'Anguerand. He was opposed by the British 3rd Brigade (now under command of Gen. Coote, as Gen. Pulteney had received a wound in the arm and been forced to leave the field). The British had only enough room to deploy one battalion in line {{and there was a}} threat that they would be outflanked near Groote Keeten, where the main action was fought. However, the Batavians were severely hampered by the terrain. The horses sometimes sank to their bellies into the dune sand and the artillery was constantly immobilized by the loose sand. Besides, the British gunboats were able to get very close to the beach and supported the British infantry vigorously, whenever they got sight of the enemy though gaps in the dunes. This British naval gunfire wrought havoc on the Batavian troops.|$|E
500|$|Blake however did {{not follow}} Beresford's orders; he still {{believed}} that the French attack would come at his front. Keeping his forward line in position, he instead moved four battalions from Zayas's division to form his new southern-facing front. [...] Zayas deployed these battalions, from the Spanish second line, in two groups. Two battalions of Spanish Guards were formed up, <b>in</b> <b>line,</b> <b>at</b> {{the top of a}} steep incline while the remaining two formed close columns behind them; a single battery of Spanish artillery supported the whole position.|$|E

500|$|Known gunmen/lawmen were {{generally}} effective, {{and in time}} the violence would subside, usually after the gunman/lawman {{had been involved in}} several shooting incidents, eventually leading to a substantial and well earned fear that kept everyone <b>in</b> <b>line.</b> <b>At</b> times they were hired by cattlemen or other prominent figures to serve as henchmen or enforcers during cattle wars. Although sanctioned by law enforcement officials, the gunmen were not always actually deputized. Sometimes, however, just to make things [...] "official", they would go through the formality of deputization. A case in point: the service of the Jesse Evans Gang, and outlaw Jesse Evans himself, as agents for the Murphy-Dolan faction during the Lincoln County War. While technically working as lawmen, they were little more than hired guns.|$|E
500|$|The DVD boxset for season nine was {{released}} by 20th Century Fox in the United States and Canada on December 19, 2006, eight years after it had completed broadcast on television.

When Peter and Carter {{are trying to make}} money, they start their own sitcom called Quahog Creek, a ripoff of WB's Dawson's Creek. The theme song [...] "I Don't Want to Wait" [...] uses misinterpreted lyrics of the actual theme song performed by Paula Cole. While Peter and Carter try to steal money from Lois' purse, Peter balances on a unicycle and hums Aram Khachaturian's [...] "Sabre Dance".
