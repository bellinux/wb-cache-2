50|$|Mining {{ventilation}} is {{a significant}} safety concern for many miners. Poor ventilation inside sub-surface mines causes exposure to harmful gases, heat, and dust, which can cause illness, injury, and death. The concentration of methane and other airborne contaminants underground can generally be controlled by <b>dilution</b> (<b>ventilation),</b> capture before entering the host air stream (methane drainage), or isolation (seals and stoppings). A ventilation system is set up to force a stream of air through the working areas of the mine. The air circulation necessary for effective ventilation of a mine is generated {{by one or more}} large mine fans, usually located above ground. Air flows in one direction only, making circuits through the mine such that each main work area constantly receives a supply of fresh air. Watering down in coal mines also helps to keep dust levels down: by spraying the machine with water and filtering the dust-laden water with a scrubber fan, miners can successfully trap the dust.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the goals}} of the Dutch {{government}} is to reduce the consumption of tobacco products and protect the non-smoker, for example, by creating smoke-free workplaces in the hospitality industry. Currently, <b>dilution</b> <b>ventilation</b> is the usual application in the hospitality industry. However, with the use of optimal ventilation (replacement ventilation rather than <b>dilution</b> <b>ventilation,</b> with correct air exchange rates and separation between smokers and non-smokers areas) and air cleaning, quite considerable reductions of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can be achieved. The hospitality industry is however, far from achieving this situation. Improving the use of existing dilution equipment up {{to the level of the}} Dutch construction requirements can lead to a roughly estimated reduction of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke of several tens of percents. Lack of proper use of sophisticated ventilation and air cleaning technologies will be a serious threat to achieving possible reductions in exposure. In all cases however, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke will remain. A 'safe' level of exposure was not found in the scientific literature. As dose-response curves are not known for environmental tobacco smoke, it is not possible to quantify the reduction in the health risk by reducing the exposure of environmental tobacco smoke through ventilation or air cleaning...|$|E
40|$|Formaldehyde is a toxic {{substance}} with {{adverse health effects}} detectable at low concentrations. Formaldehyde causes irritation of the eyes, skin and respiratory tract, wheezing, nausea, coughing, diarrhoea, vomiting, dizziness and lethargy at levels as low as 50 parts per billion (ppb) (0. 05 ppm) (Horvath et al, 1988). Formaldehyde has also been associated with aggravation of asthma, emphysema, hayfever and allergy problems at low levels (EPA, 1987). Formaldehyde is currently considered a potential carcinogen to humans (EPA, 1987). Formaldehyde is a ubiquitous gas found in elevated concentrations in indoor environments. Concentrations of formaldehyde are typically {{an order of magnitude}} greater inside buildings compared to outdoor air (Godish, 1990). Formaldehyde concentrations are particularly high in portable buildings due to the presence of more formaldehyde emitting materials and the relatively smaller interior volumes of air (Sexton et al, 1983). Major sources of formaldehyde indoors are pressed wood products, such as particle board and plywood (Elbert, 1995 : Myer and Hermans, 1985), and urea formaldehyde foam insulation (Spengler and Sexton, 1983). Other sources include carpets, curtains, floor linings, paper products, cosmetics and soaps, tobacco smoke and gas combustion (Spengler and Sexton, 1983 : Godish, 1990). Methods to reduce indoor formaldehyde include source removal or use of non- polluting materials, emission reduction through physical or chemical treatments and <b>dilution</b> through <b>ventilation</b> and air purification. While most solutions involve <b>dilution</b> through <b>ventilation,</b> increased interest in the scientific literature (Wolverton et al, 1989 : Godish and Guindon, 1989) {{as well as in the}} popular media has been given to the use of plants to purify air in buildings. Most studies however, have been conducted in the laboratory (Levin J, 1992 : Godish T and Guindon C, 1989) and are difficult to extrapolate to real life situations (Wolverton et al, 1989 : Godish and Guindon, 1989) ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this work {{was to develop a}} rapid 3 -D, {{variable}} flip angle (VFA) method for measurement of hyperpolarized (3) He T(1) which accounts for the effects of radiofrequency (RF) pulses without the need for additional flip angle information. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 3 -D, VFA method was validated in vitro over a range of oxygen partial pressures ranging from 0. 04 to 0. 52 atm. The approach was also tested in vivo in five healthy rats as a function of increasing number of wash-out breaths. The T(1) accuracy of the VFA method in the presence of flip angle mis-setting and RF field non-uniformity was compared with the CFA method using simulations and experiments. RESULTS: T(1) measurements were found to provide p(A) O(2) estimates, both in vitro and in vivo consistent with those predicted based on gas <b>dilution</b> and/or <b>ventilation</b> para- meters. For the RF pulse mis-setting (4 %) and RF field non-uniformity (3 %) used here, the VFA method provided a T(1) accuracy of better than 5 % compared to 12 % for the CFA method. CONCLUSION: With sufficient RF field homogeneity (3 %) and proper calibration (4 %), the VFA approach can provide rapid and reliable 3 -D T(1) mapping of hyperpolarized (3) He without the need for additional flip angle information...|$|R

The engineering control measures available include <b>ventilation</b> <b>dilution,</b> use of high-efficiency particulate air filters in a room or in the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system, and use of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation devices in ceiling area of a room or in the HVAC system. These methods are known to be effective in controlling or delaying airborne disease transmission in a single enclosure in both healthcare facilities and the community. However, there have been no studies of their relative effectiveness at the community level. This paper presents mathematical modeling of some engineering control strategies with a focus on ventilation and corresponding analysis of their relative effectiveness compared with other public health interventions in disease control in indoor environments at the community level.

40|$|Displacement {{ventilation}} systems take a fundamentally {{different approach to}} space conditioning than the systems found {{in the majority of}} commercial buildings, which currently use a fully mixed and <b>dilution</b> approach to <b>ventilation.</b> Displacement ventilation (DV) is an alternate air distribution method for commercial spaces, in particular schools. Previous research has shown that this type of system works well for regions where buildings require year-round cooling, however there are a growing number of buildings using this approach in Canada, where buildings require heating during winter months. A series of field studies in existing Canadian schools were carried out during the heating season over the last three years. This paper presents results from field studies conducted in schools designed for displacement ventilation with a perimeter radiant heating system.

In addition, key predictors of thermal comfort are also generally within limits set by ASHRAE standards. The results of these field studies provide some evidence of thermal comfort and IAQ-related benefits of DV in cold climate.

In the frame of activities to evaluate human exposure to ETS components in indoor environments, a series of tests were undertaken to investigate the impact of various ventilation rates on the air concentration of ETS-components. The tests were carried out at the European Commission- Joint Research Centre¿s INDOORTRON facility, a 30 m 3 walk-in type environmental chamber. Preliminary evidence indicates that changes in ventilation rates simulating conditions expected in many residential and commercial environments during smoking do not have a significant influence on the air concentration levels of ETS constituents, e. g. CO, NOx, aromatic compounds, nicotine. This suggests that efforts to reduce ETS originated indoor air pollution through higher ventilation rates in buildings, including residential areas and hospitality venues, would not lead to a meaningful improvement of indoor air quality.

40|$|Human {{health risk}} {{assessment}} of sites contaminated by volatile hydrocarbons involves site-specific evaluations of soil or groundwater contaminants {{and development of}} Australian soil health-based investigation levels (HILs). Exposure assessment of vapors arising from subsurface sources includes the use of overseas-derived commercial models to predict indoor air concentrations. These indoor vapor intrusion models commonly consider steady-state assumptions, infinite sources, limited soil biodegradation, negligible free phase, and equilibrium partitioning into air and water phases to represent advective and diffusive processes. Regional model construct influences and input parameters affect model predictions while steady-state assumptions introduce conservatism and jointly highlight the need for Australian-specific indoor vapor intrusion assessment. An Australian non-steady-state indoor vapor intrusion model has been developed to determine cumulative indoor human doses (CIHDs) and to address these concerns by incorporating Australian experimental field data to consider mixing, <b>dilution,</b> <b>ventilation,</b> sink effects and first-order soil and air degradation.

Hydrologists recommended that drilling or coring in support of characterization tests be performed dry. Dry drilling, or air coring, presents a concern about health protection for the drilling personnel. The rock generally has a high silica content, and natural zeolites are abundant.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Over 13, 000 {{shipyard}} welders in the United States {{are subjected}} to hazardous welding fume in enclosed and confined spaces with inadequate or no ventilation. The {{purpose of this study}} was to validate a training provided to shipyard workers on the effectiveness of ventilation, particularly in the dynamic shipyard environment. Training was developed using general ventilation concepts and adapting them to the shipyard. Training concepts included moving the exhaust ventilation close to the weld's plume, creating crossdrafts, and providing mixing in the space by <b>dilution</b> <b>ventilation.</b> Testing of ventilation in dynamic work environments is difficult and rarely conducted. This study tested the training concepts in the field by monitoring for welding fume concentration before and after ventilation was introduced into the space. The worker was observed while the ventilation training parameters were added or modified in the space. A personal and area DataRAM with an SKC pump measured total particulate concentrations in the worker's breathing zone and in the work space. It was found that adding an exhaust or supply blower resulted in an average of 58 % decrease (range: 21 - 77 %) in particulate concentration in the breathing zone and a 67 % decrease (range: 39 - 86 %) of particulate concentration in the space. Providing a crossdraft at the welder's breathing zone did not consistently produce a decrease in particulate concentration and instead caused a 50 % increase in particulate concentration in the breathing zone and 5 % increase in the space. Reductions in the variability of the exposures were also seen in all adjustments except exhaust ventilation, located on the ground. Additionally, reductions in the 90 th percentiles (upwards to 90 % decrease in total particulate concentrations) were observed for all ventilation adjustments. Overall, the training concepts developed for shipyard welders do provide control and protection from welding fume in the shipyard confined spaces...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} for airborne disease transmission exists anywhere humans gather indoors, {{but the situation}} becomes an acute oc-cupational hazard in laboratories where animals are used (1 - 3). Animal laboratories and animal facilities have the unique prob-lem that zoonotic diseases can be transmitted not only between animals but also from animals to humans and vice versa (4, 5). In addition, humans can develop various allergies due to pro-longed or chronic exposure to animals (6). Many common human diseases {{have the potential to}} infect animals. This propensity partly is because of biological and physi-ological similarities between humans and animals. But the potential also {{is due to the fact}} that many human and animal diseases have common evolutionary origins. Tuberculosis, for example, dates to the beginning of animal husbandry (about 15, 000 years ago) and apparently jumped species from cattle to humans (7). Similarly, many types of animal diseases have the ability to af-fect humans. Whenever airborne transmission of disease from humans to animals (or vice versa) occurs, secondary transmis-sions are rare. Transmission of diseases from animals to humans, or from humans to animals, normally occurs through direct con-tact, but can potentially occur via airborne transmission also. Contact transmissions can be controlled through appropriate operating procedures, whereas the control of airborne transmis-sion is best effected by engineered systems. The most common and reliable technologies for keeping in-door or laboratory air free of microbes are <b>dilution</b> <b>ventilation,</b> filtration, and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI). In ad-dition, laboratories and animal facilities use air pressurization to isolate areas and thereby control the spread of airborne patho-gens between zones. Each of these technologies has unique advantages and applications, and it is necessary to consider the strengths of each technology when designing air contamination-control systems. Each of these technologies will be addressed, but first it is necessary to identify the specific microbial threats and list their characteristics in a comprehensive database...|$|E
40|$|Spray Polyurethane Foam {{insulation}} (SPF) kits {{are currently}} being marketed and sold to do-it-yourselfers to meet various insulating needs. Like commercial SPF systems, the primary health concern with SPF kits is user overexposure to the isocyanates during product application. The potential health risk associated with SPF applications is driven by several factors including (but not limited to) : the toxicity of isocyanates; the potentially high exposure intensity; the quantity of isocyanates used in the process; the enclosed nature of {{the environment in which}} the product could be applied; the potentially high exposure duration/frequency; and the limited availability of control measures to reduce agent intensity (e. g., personal protective equipment, <b>dilution</b> <b>ventilation).</b> To better understand the potential hazards {{associated with the use of}} SPF kits, the current study was designed to provide an initial characterization of user exposure to airborne particulate during the application process. Specifically, the study would aim to answer the following: * What is the particle size distribution of the aerosol a SPF kit user is exposed to during application? * What is the airborne particle mass concentration a SPF kit user is exposed to during application? To answer these questions, a single commercially available SPF kit was selected for use and a mock residential environment was constructed to support repeated applications of SPF. Size-selective and total dust air sampling were conducted during the applications to determine the particle size distribution and mass concentration of aerosols generated by the selected kit. The particle size distributions developed from the size selective sampling results showed the presence of airborne particulate capable of penetration to the gas exchange regions of the respiratory tract. The average mass median diameter and geometric standard deviation of the particle size distributions were 4. 6 µm and 2. 7 respectively. The total dust sampling results showed mean airborne concentrations of 10. 40 mg/m 3. Based on the sampling results the study, personal air monitoring is needed to assess the degree of user exposure to methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) and to provide information for the selection of exposure control methods...|$|E
40|$|A key {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to share application of chilled water sprays for prevention of frictional ignitions in coal mines to provide a safe occupational environment. Frictional ignitions in underground mines if not managed adequately may lead to major explosions. Historic statistics have indicated that the greatest explosion risk originates from frictional ignitions. Methane and dust related to explosions have resulted in over 7500 lives lost in the last ten years worldwide. The experiences of chilled water sprays used for managing heat in deep metal mines in South Africa is highly relevant to frictional incendive/face heat management in Australian coal mines. Mine ventilation and water sprays (used for dust suppression and <b>dilution</b> <b>ventilation)</b> are established technologies that are widely used in coal mines for the prevention of frictional ignitions. However, greater benefits of cooling or the sharp reduction in incendive heat from cutting picks by the use of chilled water sprays outweighs cooling using the current practice of using warm service water. Chilled water spray droplets have the potential to become „improved last line of defense‟ against gas ignitions. For example, introduction of chilled water sprays with millions of fine chilled water droplets around picks and face area would provide a simple, reliable and rapid cooling power of 210 kW and 1 005 kW for continuous miners faces and Longwall shearer face respectively. A US study has noted that 90 % of all frictional ignitions occurred in coal mines that liberated at least 0. 39 % of CH 4 through their mine ventilation air methane system. However, analyses of South African statistics indicate that frictional ignition have occurred in coal and gold mines that liberated even with lower emissions between 0. 02 % to 0. 05 % of CH 4 through their mine ventilation air methane system. Therefore, it is important to raise awareness that frictional ignition risks are ever present in coal mines regardless of gas contents or gas emissions. The application of wet head systems, proactive ventilation and methane monitoring, active suppression systems, and frequent safety interactions for preventing frictional ignitions are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{world events}} {{involving}} {{chemical and biological}} (CB) attacks within critical infrastructure have highlighted a potential threat to buildings and their occupants. The March 1995 release of sarin gas in a Tokyo subway and the September 2001 mailing of letters containing anthrax spores have demonstrated the viability of using CB agents as weapons on critical infrastructure. These two attacks resulted in 17 deaths with an additional 5000 people being exposed. As a result, protection of buildings from CB threats has become an important design consideration. A design assessment system has been developed to provide stakeholders {{with the ability to}} compare multiple building designs for protection against an internal CB release. This assessment system includes modeling and simulation of CB contaminant dispersion, a quantitative method to calculate protection levels, and analyses using econometric statistical and multiple objective optimization models for design selection. This thesis describes the design assessment system phases, and includes computational details for multizone modeling and exposure assessment based on median CB lethal dosages. Multiple design options are considered which include: <b>dilution</b> <b>ventilation,</b> exhaust systems, separate air handling units, high level chemical and particulate filtration, building segmentation, and the use of a CB sensor system. Two-factor random effects and ordered probability (with random effects) statistical models are estimated which identify the design options with higher protection levels. Weighted sum, multiple objective optimization models allow the stakeholder to prioritize design option criteria. The results of the optimization identify the best design solutions based on different weighting combinations of the objective functions. A hospital emergency room with a complex air handling system is used as a case study to illustrate the overall assessment system. ^ The research framework and modeling described in this study will benefit a spectrum of stakeholders which include: owners, designers, planners, occupants, first responders, government, security and financial agencies. The framework provides a systematic and quantitative process to assist with design selection. It can be applied to existing buildings or to evaluate CB protection alternatives in future buildings during the design concept phase. Stakeholders can evaluate building designs based on their criteria and needs. The results can support building planning and future capital investments. Additionally, the methodology can be modified to perform vulnerability assessments of existing buildings, determine ingress and egress routes {{in the event of a}} CB attack, and assist with CB resource allocation. ...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. TB is an {{airborne}} {{infectious disease}} which is spread by droplet nuclei, carrying Mycobacterium tuberculosis, in the air. The droplet nuclei {{small enough to}} enter human respiratory pathways are 1 - 5 &# 956;m in size {{and are able to}} travel long distances (Hodgson, et al., 2009) (WHO, 1999), and can be distributed widely throughout (hospital) buildings (Beggs, Noakes, Sleigh, Fletcher, & Siddiqi, 2003). These droplet nuclei may remain suspended in the air until they are removed by <b>dilution</b> <b>ventilation</b> or other disinfection methods (Parsons, Hussey, Abbott, & de Jager, 2008) (National Department of Health, 2007). <b>Dilution</b> <b>ventilation</b> refers to the dilution of contaminated air with “clean” air (ACGIH, 2005), thereby reducing the concentration of contaminants in the room. One of the recognised approaches for minimising the risk of transmission of TB is to adequately ventilate the contaminated room/space. A higher ventilation rate can provide higher dilution capability, in turn reducing the risk of airborne infections (WHO, 2009). The parameters of concern in ventilation design are ventilation flow rate and airflow pattern in the room (and building). The former reduces contaminant concentration while the latter aims to move uncontaminated air to high risk areas, and contaminated air away from occupied areas, usually to the outside. The shortcomings of conventional natural ventilation strategies are well documented. The aim of this research project is to review and study the effectiveness of natural ventilation design supplemented by a turbine ventilator. The project was divided into two components: a field study and laboratory experiments. In the field study, a turbine ventilator was installed into a bedroom of a low-income house in Pretoria. Tracer gas (concentration decay) tests were performed to determine the ventilation flow rates, mean age of air and air change efficiency of four natural ventilation configurations. These included infiltration/leakage (IL), two cases of single-sided ventilation (SS 1 and SS 2), and crossventilation (CV). Three baseline (without the turbine ventilator) and three turbine ventilator tests were performed, one each in the morning, noon and afternoon. The tests were performed between February and April 2011 on typical summer days. The turbine ventilator was then tested in a laboratory environment under wind, buoyancy and a combination of wind and buoyancy forces. The wind speeds were low, ranging from 0. 0 to 0. 5 m/s (0. 0 to 1. 8 km/h), and the temperature differential tested was in the range of 5. 5 to 9. 3 &# 730;C. The in-duct velocities and centreline velocities were investigated to establish if, under the subjected force(s), a capture envelope described by Dalla Valle’s equation could be measured. This envelope would be used to determine if the turbine ventilator could potentially reduce the concentration of airborne contaminants in the test volume. In the field study baseline tests, IL, SS 1, CV and SS 2 mean – and range of - ventilation flow rates of 0. 6 [0. 5 – 0. 6], 8. 1 [6. 8 – 9. 3], 16. 9 [14. 7 – 19. 0] and 7. 4 [7. 0 – 7. 9] ACH, respectively, were reported. The baseline tests highlight the potential of cross-ventilation where, by simply opening windows and doors, a ventilation rate exceeding IPC recommendations was obtained. All configurations, save An investigation into turbine venti lators as a potential environmental co ntrol measur e to minimise the risk of transmission on TB Page IV SS 1, appear to have approached the fully-mixed case. SS 1 also showed the greatest variability in ventilation flow rates. This finding is not unexpected, as air exchange in single-sided ventilation is due to wind pressure fluctuations, which varied across each test. In addition, in all tests {{it was found that the}} ventilation flow rate was dependant on the natural ventilation configuration and openable area, and not necessarily environmental conditions. In the turbine ventilator tests, the mean ventilation flow rates for IL, SS 1, CV and SS 2 were 1. 8 [1. 6 – 2. 1], 5. 4 [5. 2 – 5. 7], 17. 7 [16. 0 – 18. 6] and 9. 5 [8. 5 – 10. 1] ACH, respectively. The mean ventilation flow rate increased in IL and SS 2 with the installation of the turbine ventilator, while in SS 1 a decrease was reported. The increase in ventilation flow rate in IL was found to be due to natural convection, where the turbine ventilator merely facilitated the exhaustion of warm air. The results of the field study are specific to the environmental conditions at the time of the test, and are not generalizable. In the laboratory experiments, the in-duct velocity increased with an increase in wind speed and temperature differential. For a given temperature differential, an increase in wind speed resulted in a decrease in in-duct velocity. Across all tests, no centreline velocity profile, described by the Dalla Valle equation, could be measured. In the wind speed tests, no capture envelope could be established. This was due to the low wind speed test range, where the resulting centreline velocity was beyond the limit of detection of the thin-film sensors. In the buoyancy forces test, a turbulent region near the base of the turbine ventilator was realised, where the magnitude and direction of the air flowing at 1. 5 D continuously changed. This turbulent region was again observed in the combined wind and buoyancy forces tests, though the magnitude was smaller and occurrence less frequent. The results of the laboratory experiments are specific to the parameters tested, and are not generalizable. By correlating the field study, laboratory experiments, and previous (similar) studies, it was concluded, that, under the tested conditions, adding a turbine ventilator as a supplement to natural ventilation system will not reduce the concentration of contaminants in the occupied zone in a room...|$|E
40|$|Nanotechnology, the {{manipulation}} of matter at a nanometer scale to produce new materials, structures, and devices having new properties, may revolutionize life in the future. It {{has the potential to}} impact medicine through improved disease diagnosis and treatment technologies and to impact manufacturing by creating smaller, lighter, stronger, and more efficient products. Nanotechnology could potentially decrease the impact of pollution by improving methods for water purification or energy conservation. Although engineered nanomaterials present seemingly limitless possibilities, they bring with them new challenges for identifying and controlling potential safety and health risks to workers. Of particular concern is the growing body of evidence that occupational exposure to some engineered nanomaterials can cause adverse health effects. As with any new technology or new material, the earliest exposures will likely occur for those workers conducting discovery research in laboratories or developing production processes in pilot plants. The research community is at the front line of creating new nanomaterials, testing their usefulness in a variety of applications and determining their toxicological and environmental impacts. Researchers handling engineered nanomaterials in laboratories should perform that work in a manner that protects their safety and health. This guidance document provides the best information currently available on engineering controls and safe work practices to be followed when working with engineered nanomaterials in research laboratories. Risk Management: Risk management {{is an integral part of}} occupational health and safety. Potential exposures to nanomaterials can be controlled in research laboratories through a flexible and adaptive risk management program. An effective program provides the framework to anticipate the emergence of this technology into laboratory settings, recognize the potential hazards, evaluate the exposure to the nanomaterial, develop controls to prevent or minimize exposure, and confirm the effectiveness of those controls. Hazard Identification: Experimental animal studies indicate that potentially adverse health effects may result from exposure to nanomaterials. Experimental studies in rodents and cell cultures have shown that the toxicity of ultrafine particles or nanoparticles is greater than the toxicity of the same mass of larger particles of similar chemical composition. Research demonstrates that inhalation is a significant route of exposure for nanomaterials. Evidence from animal studies indicates that inhaled nanoparticles may deposit deep in lung tissue, possibly interfering with lung function. It is also theorized that nanoparticles may enter the bloodstream through the lungs and transfer to other organs. Dermal exposure and subsequent penetration of nanomaterials may cause local or systemic effects. Ingestion is a third potential route of exposure. Little is known about the possible adverse effects of ingestion of nanomaterials, although some evidence suggests that nanosized particles can be transferred across the intestinal wall. Exposure Assessment: Exposure assessment is a key element of an effective risk management program. The exposure assessment should identify tasks that contribute to nanomaterial exposure and the workers conducting those tasks. An inventory of tasks should be developed that includes information on the duration and frequency of tasks that may result in exposure, along with the quantity of the material being handled, dustiness of the nanomaterial, and its physical form. A thorough understanding of the exposure potential will guide exposure assessment measurements, which will help determine the type of controls required for exposure mitigation. Exposure Control: Exposure control is the use of a set of tools or strategies for decreasing or eliminating worker exposure to a particular agent. Exposure control consists of a standardized hierarchy to include (in priority order) : elimination, substitution, isolation, engineering controls, administrative controls, or if no other option is available, personal protective equipment (PPE). Substitution or elimination is not often feasible for workers performing research with nanomaterials; however, it may be possible to change some aspects of the physical form of the nanomaterial or the process in a way that reduces nanomaterial release. Isolation includes the physical separation and containment of a process or piece of equipment, either by placing it in an area separate from the worker or by putting it within an enclosure that contains any nanomaterials that might be released. Engineering controls include any physical change to the process that reduces emissions or exposure to the material being contained or controlled. Ventilation is a form of engi-neering control that can be used to reduce occupational exposures to airborne particulates. General exhaust ventilation (GEV), also known as <b>dilution</b> <b>ventilation,</b> permits the release of the contaminant into the workplace air and then dilutes the concentration to an acceptable level. GEV alone is not an appropriate control for engineered nanomaterials or any other uncharacterized new chemical entity. Local exhaust ventilation (LEV), such as the standard laboratory chemical hood (formerly known as a laboratory fume hood), captures emissions at the source and thereby removes contaminants from the immediate occupational environment. Using selected forms of LEV properly is appropriate for control of engineered nanomaterials. Administrative controls can limit workers' exposures through techniques such as using job-rotation schedules that reduce the time an individual is exposed to a substance. Administrative controls may consist of standard operating procedures, general or specialized housekeeping procedures, spill prevention and control, and proper labeling and storage of nanomaterials. Employee training on the appropriate use and handling of nanomaterials is also an important administrative function. PPE creates a barrier between the worker and nanomaterials in order to reduce exposures. PPE may include laboratory coats, impervious clothing, closed-toe shoes, long pants, safety glasses, face shields, impervious gloves, and respirators. Other Considerations: Control verification or confirmation is essential to ensure that the implemented tools or strategies are performing as specified. Control verification can be performed with traditional industrial hygiene sampling methods, including area sampling, personal sampling, and real-time measurements. Control verification may also be achieved by monitoring the performance parameters of the control device to ensure that design and performance criteria are met. Other important considerations for effective risk management of nanomaterial expo-sure include fire and explosion control. Some studies indicate that nanomaterials may be more prone to explosion and combustion than an equivalent mass concentration of larger particles. Occupational health surveillance is used to identify possible injuries and illnesses and is recommended as a key element in an effective risk management program. Basic medical screening is prudent and should be conducted under the oversight of a qualified health-care professional. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 "May 2012.
