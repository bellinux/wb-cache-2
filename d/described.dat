5|$|Between 950,000–1,000,000 of all <b>described</b> {{species are}} insects, so over 50% of all <b>described</b> eukaryotes (1.8 million) are insects (see illustration). With only 950,000 known non-insects, if {{the actual number}} of insects is 5.5 million, they may {{represent}} over 80% of the total, and with only about 20,000 new species of all organisms being <b>described</b> each year, most insect species likely will remain undescribed, unless species descriptions greatly increase in rate.

As Bailey's description more closely matched Dixon's findings (that these variants were only partly and not completely hairless), Dixon retained Bailey's name and reclassified it as Ficus rubiginosa forma glabrescens in 2001 as it differed only in the lack of hairs on new growth from the nominate form.|$|E
