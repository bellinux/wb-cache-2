Experimental studies of temperature conditions were performed using the developed experimental model. Experimental distributions of temperature in characteristic zones of the <b>header</b> <b>unit</b> under study were obtained. The most thermally stressed zones of heat-exchanging surface were determined. Analysis of intensity of temperature pulsations on the heat-exchanging surface and coolant flow in different zones was performed, statistical and spectral characteristics of temperature pulsations were represented. Solutions were suggested aimed at the reduction of intensity of thermal pulsations. Calculation model of the fragment of <b>header</b> <b>unit</b> was developed and recommendations were given {{on the development of}} calculation models. Results of numerical modeling of transient temperature conditions and characteristics of temperature pulsations for different regimes of flow streamlining the model obtained using ANSYS CFX 14. 0 CFD-code are presented here. Comparative analysis of experimental and calculated data was performed. It was demonstrated that calculated data are in agreement with experimental data with sufficient accuracy which gives the possibility to use the developed calculation model in the future for subsequent substantiation of heat exchanger design...|$|E

The main aim {{of the study is}} the design of an improved, effective grass seed harvester. This research project sponsored by the Centre for Agricultural Technology(CAT) is seen as assistance to the Agricultural and Beef Industries which are among the major contributing industries to the Australian economy. The project involves a {{study of the}} grass seed industry in Central Queensland by conducting a market survey to determine the existing mechanisation in the seed industry and the problems faced by this group of farmers. The main aim {{of the study was to}} arrive at a design of an improved and more effective novel grass seed harvester, specifically designed by considering all the characteristics unique to grass seeds and the details which earlier research had indicated would help to increase the quality and the total yield, from the current 40 - 60 % to about 80 - 95 %. Earlier research on an air-assisted brush type of harvester indicated the problem of having to draw the seeds through the fan before separation. This seemed to cause trauma to the seeds which revoked the seed germination capacity. This research work has therefore been focused on designing a seed separator to be located ahead of the fan which could successfully separate the seeds of various shapes and sizes, from the large volume of conveying air required for suction, before entering the fan. A curved duct concentrator and a uniflow cyclone were selected as part of the experimental work and a theoretical approach was developed to understand and define the problems unique to the separation of the grass seeds. The results of tllese experiments and their comparison with the previous existing separators and harvesters have been discussed in this thesis. The technique for fan design for the harvester and finally the design specifications of a self driven harvester and a tractor mounted harvester were developed by incorporating all the harvester units, i. e the <b>header</b> <b>unit,</b> the separator and the fan...|$|E

40|$|The {{monolithic}} structural {{action of}} various types of walls of flanged cross section and walls with engaged stiffeners or returns (nonrectangular sections) is critically dependent on the shear capacity of the interface between the components making up the section. An assessment of the shear capacity of the interface may also be required {{as part of the}} elastic or inelastic analysis of structural elements. Observation of past earthquake events has confirmed that effectively connected flanges also directly influence the seismic performance of nonrectangular sections by providing a more robust and seismically resistant structural element. To analyze the significance of the parameters that influence the vertical shear resistance of interfaces of flanged sections of masonry obtained using different types of bonding and bonding patterns (<b>header</b> <b>units,</b> shear connectors, and wire ties), a series of specimens with “H-shaped” cross sections was tested. The vertical shear capacity of the interface at the flange-web intersection was assessed in each case and compared to predicted code capacities. Considerable strength reserves and shear ductility were observed in almost all cases. Following the experimental study, a numerical investigation was carried out using a simplified micromodeling finite element approach. It showed that both the size of the specimen as well as the boundary and applied loading conditions on the flanges can significantly influence the observed vertical shear resistance of the interfaces of specimens with the same bonding pattern. Using the results of the numerical investigation, the critical parameters for a test to determine the vertical shear capacity of brick masonry nonrectangular cross sections are assessed and the governing parameters for a suitable shear test suggested...|$|R

This concept already demonstrated a significant performance benefit over conventional approaches by on-the-fly header de-coding and deciphering for the data plane of the LTE protocol stack layer 2 in downlink direction. With a low-level hardware implementation we prove that also from an architectural point of view the sDMA controller is suitable for LTE terminals. Compared to conventional hardware acceleration, chip area and energy consumption are reduced by 10 % and 56 %, respectively. Furthermore, we show that the header decoding has the highest architectural impact on the sDMA controller. By a change of the hardware/software partitioning within the <b>header</b> decoding <b>unit,</b> the chip area of the sDMA controller is decreased by 35 %, while it consumes 39 % less power.

40|$|Keywords: H. 264 video compression, header compression, video {{wireless}} communications A video coding standard with high compression efficiency should have minimum redundancy in the coded bit stream.

This paper proposes a practical real-time transport protocol (RTP) packetization scheme to transport SVC video over IP networks.

The SVC NAL <b>unit</b> <b>header</b> contains a (DID, TID, QID) field to identify the association of each SVC NAL unit with its scalable enhancement layer without parsing the payload part of the SVC NAL unit. In this paper, we utilize the (DID, TID, QID) information to derive hierarchical spatio-temporal relationship of the SVC NAL units. Based on the derivation using the (DID, TID, QID) field, we propose a practical RTP packetization scheme for generating single RTP sessions in unicast and multicast transport of SVC video.

40|$|The main {{direction}} {{of reducing the}} cost of soil treatment based on resource-saving technologies is the transition to surface treatment of soil with disk tools. Double-row and four-row disc tools are manufactured. Four-row tools significantly increase tillage intensity. In the disk tools, the spherical disc is fixed on the individual pole. Disc headers are equipped with a rigid adjustment fixing the standalone pole to the frame. Recommended operating speed is up to 12 km/h. The advantage of a disc header over the disc harrow is as follows: winding plant residues on the axis are excluded. Disc mulchers are equipped with a spiral bar on which a spherical disk is mounted. The presence of the elastic element allows the working unit to do lowfrequency oscillations during movement. The result of processing is the formation of mulch in the layer of soil, which {{is a mixture of}} plant residues and soil particles with a diameter of up to 25 mm. To assess the effectiveness of the disc mulcher and the disc <b>header</b> a <b>unit</b> is composed. The initial data for calculation are as follows: tractor HTZ- 150 K, the resistivity of the soil is 6 kN/m, disk tool working width is 4 m, operating speed of the disc header is 12 km/h, operating speed of the disc mulcher is 15 km/h. Technical and economic performance of these units is defined during disking the soil. The choice of energy-saving operating regime was made in a well-known manner. Theoretical value of slippage of the leading tractor with disk mulcher was 6 %, against 9 % with the disc header. Working speed of the mulcher made up 14. 07 km/h against 10, 89 of the disc header.

This layer information included in the header can be utilized during the adaptation process to easily identify the layer of each NALU. Adaptation of the SVC stream is computationally lightweight since it can be performed by truncating the original stream without the need for transcoding.

However, for all-optical switching to become a reality, integration is necessary to significantly {{reduce the cost of}} manufacturing, installation, and operation. One promising integrated all-optical logic gate is the semiconductor optical amplifier Mach-Zehnder interferometer (SOA-MZI). This gate has previously been demonstrated capable of up to 80 Gb/s bit-wise switching operation. To enable simple installation and operation of this gate, we developed a performance optimization method which can quickly and accurately pinpoint the optimal operating point of the switch. This eliminates the need for a time-intensive search over a large parameter space and significantly simplifies the operation of the switch. With this method, we demonstrate the ability of a single SOA-MZI logic gate to regenerate ultrafast pulses over 100 passes and 10, 000 km in a regenerative loop. Ultimately, all-optical logic gates must be integrated on a single low-cost platform and demonstrated in cascaded, multi-gate operation for increased functionality. (cont.)

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the efficient adaptation of encrypted scalable video content (H. 264 /SVC). RTP-based in-network adaptation schemes on a media aware network element (MANE) in an IPTV and VoD scenario are considered. Two basic alternatives to implement encryption and adaptation of H. 264 /SVC content are investigated: (i) full, format-independent encryption {{making use of}} Secure RTP (SRTP); (ii) SVC-specific encryption that leaves the metadata relevant for adaptation (NAL <b>unit</b> <b>headers)</b> unencrypted. The SRTP-based scheme (i) is straightforward to deploy, but requires the MANE {{to be in the}} security context of the delivery, i. e., to be a trusted node. For adaptation, the content needs to be decrypted, scaled, and re-encrypted. The SVC-specific approach (ii) enables both full and selective encryption, e. g., of the base layer only. SVC-specific encryption is based on own previous work, which is substantially extended and detailed in this paper. The adaptation MANE can now be an untrusted node; adaptation becomes a low-complexity process, avoiding full decryption and re-encryption of the content. This paper presents the first experimental comparison of these two approaches and evaluates whether multimedia-specific encryption can lead to performance and application benefits. Potential security threats and security properties of the two approaches in the IPTV and VoD scenario are elementarily analyzed. In terms of runtime performance on the MANE our SVC-specific encryption scheme significantly outperforms the SRTP-based approach. SVC-specific encryption is also superior in terms of induced end-to-end delays. The performance can even be improved by selective application of the SVC-specific encryption scheme. The results indicate that efficient adaptation of SVC-encrypted content on low-end, untrusted network devices is feasible...|$|R
