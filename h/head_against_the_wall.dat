5|$|Moon's {{friendship}} with Entwistle {{led to an}} appearance on Smash Your <b>Head</b> <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall,</b> Entwistle's first solo album and the first {{by a member of}} the Who. Moon did not play drums on the album; Jerry Shirley did, with Moon providing percussion. Rolling Stone's John Hoegel appreciated Entwistle's decision not to let Moon drum, saying that it distanced his album from the familiar sound of the Who.|$|E
5|$|Lefevre retired Tristan {{to stand}} as a {{stallion}} in France at his stud near Chamant. In 1891 he was purchased by Caroline, Duchess of Montrose, who returned him to England {{as a replacement for}} the recently deceased Isonomy. Three years later he was sold again and exported to Austria-Hungary. In 1897 he {{died as a result of}} injuries sustained after dashing his <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of his stable in a fit of temper. Tristan was not a great success as a stallion, but he did sire Canterbury Pilgrim, who won The Oaks in 1896 and became a highly successful and influential broodmare. Other good winners included Le Nord (Dewhurst Stakes) and Le Nicham (Champion Stakes).|$|E

25|$|The {{individual}} {{engages in}} the behavior because it produces a decrease in aversive stimulation. Put another way, something aversive is occurring in some location on the organism's body, and engaging {{in the behavior}} decreases the level of discomfort. For example, a child bangs his <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> to decrease the pain experienced from a toothache. Another example includes a child scratching his arm to decrease the level of itchiness experienced from a bug bite. Common forms of aversive stimulation abated by engaging in specific behaviors include sinus pain, itching, hunger, etc.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, Entwistle {{became the}} first member to release a solo album, Smash Your <b>Head</b> <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall,</b> which earned him a cult {{following}} in the US for fans of his brand of black humour. Other solo studio albums included: Whistle Rymes (1972), Rigor Mortis Sets In (1973), Mad Dog (1975), Too Late the Hero (1981), and The Rock (1996). In 1974, he compiled Odds & Sods, a collection of unreleased Who material. The band was preoccupied with recording The Who by Numbers {{during the spring of}} 1975 and did not do any touring for most of the year, so Entwistle spent the summer performing solo concerts. He also fronted the John Entwistle Band on US club tours during the 1990s, and appeared with Ringo Starr's All Starr Band in 1995. A talented artist, Entwistle held regular exhibitions of his paintings, with many of them featuring the Who.|$|E
25|$|Lauren meets Josh Hemmings (Eddie Eyre), a man {{who works}} in her father Max Branning's (Jake Wood) office, and they are {{attracted}} to each other. Josh encourages Lauren {{to apply for a}} job there but Steven is unimpressed by Lauren's plans as he wants her {{to spend more time with}} him and Louie. He suggests that they start trying for a baby but Lauren refuses because she wants to concentrate on her career, so Steven secretly pieces holes in condoms. Lauren gets a job at the company and tells Steven that she barely sees Josh but Steven visits her at work and sees her with Josh, and he becomes suspicious. Steven is unaware that Lauren is pregnant and planning an abortion, although her sister Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) makes him question Lauren and Josh's relationship. During an argument with Abi, who resents Lauren, Steven is stunned to hear Lauren aborted his child. A few days later, following Abi's 21st birthday party, another disagreement between Abi and Steven ends with them sleeping together. Some time after, Steven has sex with Abi again after seeing footage of Lauren and Josh. Despite the affair with Abi, Steven insists he wants to be with Lauren and Abi does her best to poison his mind against her. When Lauren tells Josh that she doesn't love Steven, Abi persuades her to return to New Zealand. Just as she is about to leave, Josh visits Steven and tells him that Lauren has resigned from her job. Steven bashes his <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> causing it to bleed. He later bumps into Lauren before she leaves and she plans to end their relationship, but notices Steven's head injury. In a desperate act to keep Lauren with him, Steven lies the injury is caused by him trying to remove a brain tumour, claiming that he has cancer and he is dying.|$|E

[...] One employment agency head who only hired legal household workers said, [...] "You have no idea, the frustration, sitting here, knocking your <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> trying to do what's right. And then you have a Zoë Baird who exposes the fact that everybody else is breaking the law."

2500|$|Entwistle's wry and {{sometimes}} dark sense of humour clashed at times with Pete Townshend's more introspective, intellectual work. Although he wrote songs on every Who album except for Quadrophenia, he was frustrated at Townshend not {{allowing him to}} sing them himself. As he said, [...] "I got a couple [...] on per album but my problem was that I wanted to sing the songs and not let Roger sing them." [...] This was {{a large part of}} the reason that he became the first member of the band to release a solo album, Smash Your <b>Head</b> <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> (1971) which featured contributions from Keith Moon, Jerry Shirley, Vivian Stanshall, Neil Innes and the Who's roadie, Dave [...] "Cyrano" [...] Langston.|$|E
5|$|Warren Jeffs' prison {{life has}} been tumultuous. At Utah's Purgatory Correctional Facility, he {{suffered}} from infected ulcers on his knees, which resulted from praying days on end during solitary confinement. He attempted to commit suicide by hanging himself at one point. In August 2008, Jeffs went into convulsions after banging his <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of his cell repetitively {{and had to be}} taken to a hospital by helicopter.|$|R

He first complains about head pain, but other symptoms, hypogonadism, organ failure, and chemical imbalance which may explain Nate's cold personality, arise. Chase finds HPRT enzyme deficiency, which could mean Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome. Cameron says Kelley-Seegmiller victims self-mutilate, chew their lips, and bang their <b>heads</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Jackson {{developed}} body dysmorphia as {{a response}} to ridicule, stating, [...] "I'd {{look in the mirror and}} hate myself. I'd sit and cry. It was so hard for me to look at myself and find something that I liked. Not just physically, but something that was good in me". She also inflicted self-harm, banging her <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> when feeling unattractive. She traced her fragility to her abusive marriage to recording artist James DeBarge when she was 16 years old. Jackson recalled, [...] "It all has to do with very low self esteem. Especially going into a relationship like that very young... someone telling you things like, 'no one is ever going to want you again, you should be happy here with me.'" [...] Attempting to alter his behavior and drug addiction, she explained, [...] "I learned the hard way that you can't change a person." [...] Recalling her divorce, she revealed, [...] "There came a point when I finally said, 'You know what? I just don't care what happens.' I had to do what I wanted to but had been too afraid to. And at that point I didn't care if I got my brains beat out. I just went ahead and did it. And I got my ass kicked for it. But I'm happy that I did it, or I don't think I would be here today".|$|E

The band are pictures at the Cinema trying to cheer Healy up after she's had her heart broke, eventually the band start having a laugh by throwing popcorn at her. Sandford and Wiseman are seen putting the phone down on their boyfriends after singing the lyrics, [...] "there's nothing left to say". As the chorus kicks in, White is seen walking out of the house, slamming the door, singing the lyrics, [...] "forever is over", which means she's left her boyfriend, she has had enough. The band start smashing and throwing things as they are angry with their ex-boyfriends. Wiseman is later seen having lunch with her boyfriend, which she is not very happy about and starts pulling faces, and later throws her glass of wine over him, and throws her engagement ring away. Sandford is also seen trying to phone her boyfriend, but he does not pick up the phone, and she puts her <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> and King comes comfort her by putting her arm around her.

If he found me bustling about doing any little thing, he sometimes half took his coat off, as if with an intention of helping by a great exertion; but he never got any further.
