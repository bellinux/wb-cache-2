5|$|Increasingly, {{however, the}} ice trade {{began to focus}} on {{supplying}} the growing cities on the east coast of the U.S. and the needs of businesses across the Midwest. The citizens of New York City and Philadelphia became huge consumers of ice during their long, hot summers, and additional ice was harvested from the Hudson River and Maine to fulfil the demand. Ice began to be used <b>in</b> <b>refrigerator</b> cars by the railroad industry, allowing the meat packing industry around Chicago and Cincinnati to slaughter cattle locally, sending dressed meat east for either the internal or overseas markets. Chilled refrigerator cars and ships created a national industry in vegetables and fruit that could previously only have been consumed locally. American and British fishermen began to preserve their catches in ice, allowing longer voyages and bigger catches, and the brewing industry became operational all-year around. As U.S. ice exports diminished after 1870, Norway became {{a major player in the}} international market, shipping large quantities of ice to England and Germany.|$|E

25|$|Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus is a {{bacterial}} subspecies traditionally isolated from European yogurts. Lactobacillus bulgaricus GLB44 {{differs from the}} rest of the L. bulgaricus strains as it was isolated from the leaves of Galanthus nivalis (snowdrop flower) in Bulgaria, becoming the only known strain of this subspecies that has vegan origin (not from yogurt) available as a commercial probiotic. Probiotics are health promoting bacteria which, when consumed in adequate amounts, confer a benefit on the host, normally associated with positive effects on the digestive and immune systems, and are usually prescribed during or after antibiotic treatment to alleviate the symptoms of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Probiotics are also associated with decreasing of the risk of traveler’s diarrhea. The natural habitat of the snowdrop flower are European mountainous regions. Thus, GLB44 is capable of surviving in freezing temperatures, as the snowdrop flowers between January and May in nature, when the temperatures can fall below freezing in this region. These characteristics of its natural habitat allows for GLB44 to survive in foods that are plant based and remain unaffected when stored <b>in</b> <b>refrigerator</b> temperatures.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation was the study of degredation rates of some important pesticides for crop protection, applied in fruits and vegetables stored under nonhitherto-studied conditions. Pesticides studies were: parathion, dimethoate, azinphos ethyl, azinphow methyl, parathion methyl and chlorpyrifos methyl that were applied in apples (Golden, Granny Smith, Starking). in lemons (Maglino), in mandarins (Avana), in tomatoes, and those that were transferred after processing in fruit juices (lemons and apples), in toamato juice and tomato pickles. The degradation of the above mentioned pesticides and the mentioned crops (on trees and plants) were studied under different conditions of storage (at ambient temperature, <b>in</b> <b>refrigerators</b> and <b>in</b> controlled atmosphere <b>refrigerators).</b> The degradation of these pesticides was also studied after processing, as juicing, pickle preparation and subsequent storage of these products <b>in</b> <b>refrigerators</b> (tomato juice) and under ambient temperature conditions (tomato pickles). Sample analyses were performed after experimentation and transformations of known methods of gas chromatography. From {{the results of these}} studies, were calculated and presented for first time the equations and degradation rates of studied pesticides decomposed under different nonhitherto studied experimental conditions of storage, as <b>in</b> <b>refrigerators,</b> common and with controlled atmospheres and under ambient temperature condition. ...|$|R
