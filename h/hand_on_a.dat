5|$|Rhys {{goes along}} to a cookery class that Vanessa is {{teaching}} and flirts with Tiffany Giles (Shaye Hopkins) to make Vanessa jealous. She invites him {{to dinner and}} he suffers an allergic reaction to the food. Vanessa and Rhys almost kiss, but are interrupted by Lucas. The following day, Rhys goes to Harold's Store and kisses Vanessa. Rhys opens up to her about his father and they arrange a date. When Troy Miller (Dieter Brummer) is brought into the hospital, he tells Rhys that Jade attacked him. Rhys reports this {{to the police and}} when Jade finds out, she asks him to leave the house. Rhys applies for a three-month study tour in Japan and asks Vanessa to come with him. Rhys' mother later gives him a ring so that he can propose to Vanessa. Shortly before leaving for Japan, Rhys comes across a car accident involving the street's teenagers. He rings the emergency services, before assessing their injuries. Rhys cuts his <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> piece of wreckage, which forces him to cancel the trip to Japan. He later learns that he has only a five per cent chance of making a full recovery. Following an EMG, Rhys learns that there has been no improvement to his hand. After altering the report to say that his nerves are healing, Rhys is invited to assist Jessica in surgery.|$|E
5|$|The chancel {{contains}} memorials to the Lords Stanley of Alderley. The {{memorial to}} John Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley of Alderley contains his effigy dressed in peer's robes lying under a canopy with his <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> book, dated 1856 and by Richard Westmacott. On {{the other side}} of the chancel is a memorial to his son Edward Stanley, his effigy holding a scroll in his hand and with a dog at his feet. Engraved in brass on the side of the memorial are the figures of his widow and children. Lady Stanley is seated in the middle with their four surviving sons on her right, five surviving daughters on her left and three children who had died at a young age at her knee and on her lap.

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} his reign, John made {{a concerted}} effort to secure Antioch. On the way, he {{captured}} the southern coast of Asia Minor and Cilicia. He advanced into Syria at the head of his veteran army, which had been seasoned by a lifetime of campaigning. Although John fought hard for the Christian cause in the campaign in Syria, there was a famous incident where his allies, Prince Raymond of Antioch and Count Joscelin II of Edessa, sat around playing dice while John pressed the Siege of Shaizar. These Crusader Princes were suspicious of each other and of John, and neither wanted the other to gain from participating in the campaign, while Raymond also wanted to hold on to Antioch which he had agreed to hand over to John if the campaign was successful. Ultimately, Joscelin and Raymond conspired to keep John out of Antioch, and while he was preparing to lead a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and a further campaign, he accidentally grazed his <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> poison arrow while out hunting. The poison set in and shortly afterwards he died.|$|E

25|$|A myth {{developed}} {{surrounding his}} death and roses. It was said: “To honour a visitor, the Egyptian beauty Nimet Eloui, Rilke gathered some roses from his garden. While doing so, he pricked his <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> thorn. This small wound failed to heal, grew rapidly worse, soon his entire arm was swollen, and his other arm became affected as well”, and so he died.|$|E
25|$|Some pubs {{disguise}} keg beer {{by having}} an imitation pump {{handle on the}} bar. If the bar staff have merely turned on a tap, or are just resting their <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> very small handle with no pump action, then this is a keg beer. Exceptions are some pubs (in the north and occasionally elsewhere) which use electric pumps or the pubs in Scotland that use traditional air-pressure founts on cask ale.|$|E

When the Doors played the song at live concerts, Manzarek used the Fender Rhodes Piano Bass without augmentation.|$|E
25|$|Two {{incidents}} {{occurred at}} the tour's second stop at the PNE Coliseum on March 2, 1999 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. After Manson made a lewd remark about Love during his band's performance, Love ran onstage, hiked her dress and jumped on Manson's back while he sang. Later in the show, Manson suffered from dizziness and fainted onstage, injuring his <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> monitor as he fell. Initially he pretended {{it was part of}} the show, but left the stage after performing their signature song to seek medical attention. When he returned onstage, he pulled the plugs off of their instrument amplifiers and stormed offstage without performing an encore. The rest of the band left the stage afterward.|$|E
25|$|Note that Game Value is {{dependent}} {{not only on}} the cards held (including the Skat) but also on which game is being declared and the outcome of the play. Each holding can thus be evaluated differently by different players. A risk-taking player might be willing to declare <b>Hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> holding on which another player might not — these two players will therefore give different valuations to the same holding. However, after all tricks have been played, it is always possible to determine the exact Game Value by combining the actual holding with the type of game and outcome of the play. Only then it becomes apparent if declarer has won or lost (if he overbid).|$|E

25|$|Early in {{the fourth}} quarter, Starr was knocked {{out of the game}} when he jammed the thumb on his {{throwing}} <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> sack by Davidson. (Starr was replaced by Zeke Bratkowski, who would be sacked on his only pass attempt.) But later in the period, the Packers put the game completely out of reach when defensive back Herb Adderley intercepted a pass intended for Fred Biletnikoff and returned it 60 yards for a touchdown, making the score 33–7. Oakland did manage to score on their next drive after the turnover with a second 23-yard touchdown pass from Lamonica to Miller, set up by Pete Banaszak's 41-yard reception on the previous play. But all the Raiders' second touchdown did was make the final score look remotely more respectable, 33–14.|$|E
25|$|The {{scene is}} within a room where, at an open end on the left, a wide-eyed bull stands over a woman grieving over a dead child in her arms. The center is {{occupied}} by a horse falling in agony {{as if it had}} just been run through by a spear or javelin. The large gaping wound in the horse's side is a major focus of the painting. Under the horse is a dead, apparently dismembered soldier; his <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> severed arm still grasps a shattered sword from which a flower grows. On the open palm of the dead soldier is a stigma, a symbol of martyrdom derived from the stigmata of Christ. A light bulb blazes in the shape of an evil eye over the suffering horse's head (the bare bulb of the torturer's cell).|$|E

500|$|In 1976, Timothy O'Neill {{created a}} pixellated pattern named [...] "Dual-Tex". He called the digital {{approach}} [...] "texture match". The initial {{work was done}} by <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> retired M113 armoured personnel carrier; O'Neill painted the pattern on with a 2-inch (5 centimetre) roller, forming squares of colour by hand. Field testing showed that the result was good compared to the U. S. Army's existing camouflage patterns, and O'Neill {{went on to become}} an instructor and camouflage researcher at West Point military academy.|$|E
500|$|An {{alternative}} {{toll road}} suitable for wagons was eventually constructed and this, combined with colder weather that froze the muddy ground, allowed the White Pass to reopen, and prospectors {{began to make}} their way into Canada. Moving supplies and equipment over the pass had to be done in stages. Most divided their belongings into [...] packages that could be carried on a man's back, or heavier loads that could be pulled by <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> sled. Ferrying packages forwards and walking back for more, a prospector would need about thirty round trips, a distance of at least , before they had moved all of their supplies {{to the end of the}} trail.

500|$|With Far Cry 3 being a {{commercial}} success, Ubisoft considered the Far Cry series {{one of their}} most important brands, and they hinted that a sequel was in development in June 2013. On October 3, 2013, Martinez mentioned that he was working on the soundtrack for the game. [...] In March 2014 the game's setting and features were leaked. The game was officially announced on May 15, 2014, and the first gameplay footage was revealed during Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014. The game's cover art, which shows the light-skinned Pagan Min resting his <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> dark-skinned person, caused controversy and accusation of racism. Hutchinson later responded and clarified by saying that Pagan Min is not a white person, and that the other person depicted is not the game's protagonist. Hutchinson added that the reaction of the community regarding the cover art was [...] "uncomfortable".|$|E

500|$|During {{one scene}} in [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes", Munch and Bolander force a suspect {{to take a}} [...] "electrolyte neutron {{magnetic}} scan test", which involved placing his <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> copy machine and photocopying his hand as they asked him questions. Prior to giving the exam, the detectives loaded papers with the words [...] "True" [...] and [...] "False" [...] into the machine, so when the final copies came out it appeared the machine was giving answers to the questions. The detectives pretended the test was radioactive and dangerous to further make the suspect nervous. This scene {{was based on a}} real-life trick used by Baltimore Police Department detectives in 1988. The real-life instance was featured in , the 1991 David Simon non-fiction book about a Baltimore Police Department, which was adapted into the Homicide series. This hoax was also used in [...] "More with Less", the fifth season premiere episode of David Simon's later police drama series, The Wire.|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack {{and musical}} score for Uyarndha Manithan were {{composed}} by M. S. Viswanathan, while the lyrics {{were written by}} Vaali. The soundtrack was released under the label of Saregama. Vaali worked on the film alongside Adimaippen (1969) and felt that working on two films simultaneously was [...] "torrid". In the composition and picturisation for the song [...] "Andha Naal Gnaabagam", Viswanathan was inspired {{by one of the}} songs in My Fair Lady (1964), in which Rex Harrison sings with a walking stick in <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> golf course. Due to T. M. Soundararajan's laughter being inadequate during the recording of this song, Viswanathan himself recorded his own laughter. M. Saravanan, in his book AVM 60 Cinema, described the use of dialogues in [...] "Andha Naal Gnaabagam" [...] as [...] "something new to Tamil cinema". The song was parodied by Vikram and Vivek in Dhool (2003), and [...] "Paal Polave" [...] was parodied by Santhanam in Yuvan Yuvathi (2011).|$|E
500|$|In skilled hands, the net was {{a useful}} weapon. The retiariuss primary {{objective}} with {{it was to}} capture his opponent. A ewer found at Rheinzabern demonstrates the throwing technique: the retiarius held the net folded up {{in his right hand}} and cast it underhanded. He held his trident and dagger in his left hand, careful to keep the trident's prongs pointed downward to avoid snagging it in the mesh. If the toss missed, the retiarius used the drawrope tied to his wrist to bring the net back in <b>hand.</b> <b>On</b> <b>a</b> successful cast, the gladiator tightened the drawcord around the net's perimeter and tried to unbalance or topple his rival. A successful cast of the net could win the battle for the retiarius straightaway. This was not certain, however, as a mosaic at the National Archaeological Museum in Madrid shows: in the first panel, the retiarius Kalendio has caught his opponent, a secutor named Astyanax, in his net. In the later image, however, Kalendio lies on the ground, wounded, and raises his dagger to surrender. The inscription above Kalendio shows the sign for [...] "null", implying that the match organisers ordered him killed.|$|E
