2500|$|In 1980, the Council {{threatened}} {{to close the}} Hall to save money; this prompted Herne Bay's twelve Council representatives to attempt to save the situation. In 1988 there was a move brought by Councillor Bill Brade and backed by the British Film Institute and police to show films at the Hall because the local Cannon Cinema had been closed and to distract local youth from vandalism. In 1991 staff from the Windsor Cinema in Broadstairs brought portable equipment and seating for converting the Hall into a cinema for three evenings per week plus a children's matinee. In 1993 there was a move to manage the Hall via a local trust composed of the building's user groups, including Herne Bay Operatic Society, Theatrecraft, Herne Bay Active Retirement Association and 691 Promotions. From 1996 to 2004 [...] the Hall was run by Eurest, but the business reverted to Council control for a three-year trial from March 2004 after the contractor served up frozen roast potatoes at a dinner dance in November 2002. The Council's manager from 2004 to 2006 was Tony Farrow who put in a new £20,000 sound system. In 2006 the Council raised <b>hire</b> <b>charges</b> for the Hall from £750 to £1,450 per day, pricing out one of its regular entertainers, Stars in the Afternoon.|$|E

50|$|By March 1846 {{the line}} between Exeter and Teignmouth was {{substantially}} complete except for the laying of the pipe for the atmospheric traction. In order to generate some income the directors decided to open this section using locomotives. Two 2-2-2 locomotives were hired in from the GWR at a <b>hire</b> <b>charge</b> of 1s 4d per train mile; the locomotives were named Exe and Teign. The passenger service started on the Saturday of Whitsun weekend, 30 May 1846, and huge numbers of people travelled.

The Company, and not Broome, had been paying the locomotive <b>hire</b> <b>charges</b> and it is likely that they had taken responsibility for a number of other costs not properly specified in Pain's contract arrangements. The financial crisis could be averted, they felt, if the line could soon be opened, on 17 July.

Three years ago, an experiment called Project Gilgamesh was undertaken at a lifers only prison, where scientists had attempted to turn the convicts into super-soldiers, the first test subject being a prisoner named Bane. Although the experiment was a success, it backfired immediately, as Bane overpowered the guards {{and became the first}} prisoner to escape in 25 years.

50|$|Unusually for a {{national}} stadium, {{and as a result}} of the conversion of the playing surface to artificial turf, the football field at Changlimithang is available for public hire and is extremely popular with people in Thimphu, with the pitch booked for public use from 5pm-1am most days during the week as office workers seek to make use of it and from 7am to 9pm at weekends. This has proved to be a valuable source of income for the Bhutan Football Federation. With teams needing to make bookings weeks in advance, the Federation made Nu 75,000 in the first fortnight that the pitch was available to the public, with the money gained from <b>hire</b> <b>charges</b> going towards financing additional artificial surfaces planned for elsewhere in the country. Demand for the chance to play on an artificial surface is now so great that the Bhutan Football Federation are prepared to begin to hire out the artificial pitch at Changjiji, currently available only to train members of the national squad. There are plans to open artificial surfaces in three more Dzongkhags in the near future.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the trains}} were running ostensibly satisfactorily, {{there had been}} {{technical}} miscalculations. It seems that Brunel originally specified 12 in for the level section to Newton and 15 in pipes for the hilly part of the route, and in specifying the stationary engine power and vacuum pumps, he considerably underpowered them. The 12 in pipes {{seem to have been}} scrapped, and 15 in pipes installed in their place, and 22 in pipes started to be installed on the hilly sections. Changes to the engine control governors were made to uprate them to run 50% faster than designed. It was reported that coal consumption was much heavier than forecast, at 3s 1½d per train mile instead of 1s 0d (and instead of 2s 6d which was the <b>hire</b> <b>charge</b> for the leased GWR steam locomotives). This may have been partly due to the electric telegraph not yet having been installed, necessitating pumping according to the timetable, even though a train might be running late. When the telegraph was ready, on 2 August, coal consumption in the following weeks fell by 25%.|$|R
50|$|To {{make use}} of the system, one must {{download}} the oBike application, register and pay a deposit. The App is used to borrow and return the bicycles and users are charged by quarter or half-hour, with payment applied to their Credit/Debit card. To ride bikes, users must have an internet connection and Bluetooth enabled on their mobile device to enable unlocking of their desired oBike, which is done by scanning the QR code or entering the corresponding bicycle number. If successful, the lock on the rear wheel opens automatically. Once users finish their ride, they need to manually lock and leave the bike in any legal parking spot to be ready for the next user. At the time of locking the bike the user must again ensure they have a Bluetooth and an internet connection, in order for the oBike system to record the end of the ride and correctly calculate the <b>hire</b> <b>charge.</b> If violations are reported, a credit system penalizes the corresponding user after a certain number of times, and in extreme cases, the user could be suspended from the platform.|$|R

Negotiations with Sporting stalled however when Rovers said that they could not afford to pay the <b>hire</b> <b>charge</b> (having told the Council that they did not plan to pay rent when applying for the new lease) and at the time of expiry of the lease in early August it appeared that Rovers were intending to occupy the ground until a court order removed them. On 11 August 2010, Rovers were thrown out of the Southern League after not being able to show that they had a ground to play at. Manager and director of football Steve Daniels resigned, and the club did not play football during the 2010-11 season.|$|R

University of Tennessee defensive line coach and original Miami Dolphin Frank Emanuel was <b>hired,</b> <b>charged</b> {{with the task of}} improving the kicking teams that occasionally lost games for the Buccaneers. Tom Bass, considered to be the chief architect of the Buccaneer defense, accepted the San Diego Chargers' defensive coordinator position that had recently been vacated by Jack Pardee. Bass' duties were taken over by defensive backfield coach Wayne Fontes, who had turned down a similar offer from the Los Angeles Rams. Fontes was noted for having built a league-leading secondary out of players obtained from trades and waivers. It was alleged that McKay disagreed with Bass over certain defensive philosophies, and so encouraged Fontes to remain with Tampa Bay, with the intent of giving him Bass' job. This was the first major defensive coaching change since the franchise's inception. Former Notre Dame assistant Jim Gruden was brought in as running backs coach, displacing George Chaump, who turned down an offer to remain in the organization in a different position. Chaump later accepted a head coaching position at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. Longtime equipment manager Pat Marcuccillo unexpectedly resigned during the season, for unknown reasons that were revealed a week later, when he was arrested for selling $21,000 worth of stolen game jerseys.|$|R

Hale was formally charged with the murder of Henry Roan, who had been killed on the Osage Reservation land, making it a Federal crime. Two of his accomplices had died before the FBI investigation was completed. Hale and his associates were finally convicted in state and federal trials from 1926 to 1929, which had changes of venues, hung juries, appeals and overturned verdicts. In 1926, Ernest George Burkhart pleaded guilty to being part of the conspiracy.|$|R

Where a replacement car is <b>hired</b> the <b>charges</b> can be recovered, if the car is needed for use and {{is similar to the}} damaged vehicle. Real difficulties arise if the motorist hires on credit. The agreement must comply with regulations applicable to credit agreements and constitute an enforceable contract, and, even then, full recovery of the charges is possible only if the motorist is impecunious. In spite of attempts to calm conflict over these matters, credit hire has prompted a flood of litigation that has often confused issues and created difficult distinctions, which, in turn, have increased tensions in the industry and caused bafflement among motorists...|$|R

Shortly after noon on February 21, 1933, the Moody was blown in two. The explosion was placed between two water tight compartments so she would continue to float after the explosion. Two other explosions took out the water tight bulkheads and the Moody finally sank at 5:30 PM. Several boats, many with newsmen aboard hoping to film the sinking destroyer, hovered around the film crew interfering with operations. Threats were exchanged, but the filming was done.|$|R
