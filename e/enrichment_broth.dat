The selective <b>enrichment</b> <b>broths</b> had no effect on the efficiency of PCR when boiling-centrifugation and salting-out were used. On the other hand, phenol-chloroform was superior (P< 0. 05) when combined to Rappaport-Vassiliadis.

40|$|A study {{conducted}} on 300 fecal samples from a cow and a pig, each artificially contaminated with approximately four Salmonella organisms revealed that, {{of the three}} <b>enrichment</b> <b>broths</b> {{used in conjunction with}} the three selective media, the maximum number of isolations were obtained with Brilliant Green MacConkey broth (BGMB), followed by those obtained with tetrathionate (TTB), and the least with selenite broth. The combination of BGMB with Brilliant Green-neutral red-lactose agar (BGNRLA), and TTB with desoxycholate citrate agar (DCA) gave an equal number of isolations. Of the three selective media used in conjunction with the three <b>enrichment</b> <b>broths,</b> the maximum number of recoveries were obtained on BGNRLA, followed by those on DCA, and least number of isolations on bismuth sulfite agar (BSA). The combination of selenite F broth-BSA appeared to be somewhat inhibitory for the growth of Salmonella organisms. Of the two selective media combinations, the DCA-BGNRLA combination yielded the highest number of isolations. The use of all three selective media gave still better results. Selenite and tetrathionate broths were found unsuitable for isolating Salmonella choleraesuis from feces. BGMB, containing 100 μg of Brilliant Green per ml, proved to be a useful enrichment medium for the isolation of this organism from cow and pig fecal samples, each inoculated with 16 organisms. Observations recorded seemed to suggest that contaminant bacteria perhaps outgrow and mask S. choleraesuis.

40|$|Background As a {{standard}} method for pneumococcal carriage studies, the World Health Organization recommends nasopharyngeal swabs be transported and stored at cool temperatures {{in a medium}} containing skim-milk, tryptone, glucose and glycerol (STGG). An <b>enrichment</b> <b>broth</b> used for transport at room temperature in three carriage studies performed in Norway may have a higher sensitivity than STGG. We therefore compared the media in vitro and in vivo. Methods For the in vitro component, three strains (serotype 4, 19 F and 3) were suspended in STGG and <b>enrichment</b> <b>broth.</b> Recovery was compared using latex agglutination, quantification of bacterial loads by real-time PCR of the lytA gene, and counting colonies from incubated plates. For the in vivo comparison, paired swabs were obtained from 100 children and transported in STGG at cool temperatures or in <b>enrichment</b> <b>broth</b> at room temperature. Carriage was identified by latex agglutination and confirmed by Quellung reaction. Results In vitro, the cycle threshold values obtained by PCR did not differ between the two media (p = 0. 853) and no clear difference in colony counts was apparent after incubation (p = 0. 593). In vivo, pneumococci were recovered in 46 % of swabs transported in STGG and 51 % of those transported in <b>enrichment</b> <b>broth</b> (Kappa statistic 0. 90, p = 0. 063). Discussion Overall, no statistical differences in sensitivity were found between STGG and <b>enrichment</b> <b>broth.</b> Nevertheless, some serotype differences were observed and STGG appeared slightly less sensitive than <b>enrichment</b> <b>broth</b> for detection of nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococci by culturing. We recommend the continued use of STGG for transport and storage of nasopharyngeal swabs in pneumococcal carriage studies {{for the benefit of}} comparability between studies and settings, including more resource-limited settings...|$|E

40|$|Two {{enrichment}} {{methods were}} compared {{for their ability}} to recover Clostridium difficile from stool samples. One method used selective enrichment in an antibiotic-containing broth followed by detection with a latex particle agglutination (LPA) reagent. The other used enrichment in a non-selective broth following treatment of the specimen with alcohol. With clinical specimens enrichment culture was significantly more successful at detecting C. difficile than direct plating. Alcohol shock enrichment was twice as effective as direct culture, while selective <b>broth</b> <b>enrichment</b> was three times more effective. The use of LPA for screening selective <b>enrichment</b> <b>broths</b> for C. difficile should prove a cost-effective measure as only positive broths (about 20 %) require subculture for confirmation...|$|R
40|$|Many enteric {{media are}} more {{efficient}} {{for the detection}} of salmonellae than of shigellae. Comparisons of three <b>enrichment</b> <b>broths</b> and three plating media were made during analysis of 1, 405 stool specimens to choose a combination of media which would enhance detection of shigellae as well. Gram-Negative (GN), Selenite, and Silliker's Broths were streaked to E M B, Salmonella-Shigella (SS), and xylose lysine deoxycholate (XLD) Agars. The <b>enrichment</b> <b>broths</b> produced a twofold increase in isolations of both salmonellae and shigellae over direct streaking. All three broths performed equally well for Salmonella detection, but GN and Silliker's produced twice as many Shigella isolates as did Selenite. Comparison of the plating media showed that XLD was markedly more efficient than either E M B or SS Agar for the recovery of both genera. SS Agar was superior to E M B for isolation of salmonellae after enrichment, whereas E M B was better for isolation of shigellae by direct streaking. Both E M B and SS were more effective when used after GN and Silliker's than after Selenite. GN Broth and XLD Agar were the most efficient combination of media.

40|$|A {{real-time}} PCR assay previously {{developed for}} use on the Roche LightCycler platform was investigated {{as an alternative to}} culture for the direct detection of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in clinical specimens. PCR primers and fluorescence resonance energy transfer hybridization probes specific for the vanA and vanB genes were combined in a multiplex real-time PCR assay performed directly with fecal material obtained by rectal swabbing and with <b>enrichment</b> <b>broth</b> samples. DNA was prepared from the rectal swabs and enrichment broths with a commercially available DNA preparation column designed specifically for use with fecal specimens. One hundred eighty duplicate rectal swabs were obtained from 42 patients who were previously found to be positive for VRE and who were being monitored for carriage of VRE. Direct and <b>enrichment</b> <b>broth</b> cultures were performed with one swab, while PCR was performed with the other swab as well as any corresponding presumptive positive <b>enrichment</b> <b>broth.</b> In total, 100 specimens from 30 patients remained positive for VRE by at least one method.

Direct culture was positive for VRE for only 43 specimens from 11 patients, while <b>enrichment</b> <b>broth</b> culture was positive for VRE for 75 specimens from 22 patients. Inhibition studies for the multiplex real-time PCR assay, performed by spiking the DNA extracts from 50 negative rectal swabs and the corresponding enrichment broths with between 1 and 10 CFU of a VanB Enterococcus faecium strain, detected inhibition rates of 55. 1 and 10 %, respectively.

40|$|The {{efficiencies}} {{of three}} <b>enrichment</b> <b>broths</b> and four plating media for isolation of enteric pathogens were compared from 1, 117 stool specimens.

By contrast, Selenite Broth (SF) found 90 % of the total salmonellae isolates and 82 % of the shigellae isolates. Gram-Negative Broth (GN) found 82 % and 85 %, respectively, but Tetrathionate found only 60 % and 39 %. Thus, SF and GN were comparable for both salmonellae and shigellae and significantly better than Tetrathionate Broth for both. The plating media compared were MacConkey (MAC), deoxycholate citrate (DC), xylose lysine deoxycholate (XLD), and xylose lysine Brilliant Green (XLBG) Agars. Of the total salmonellae isolated, XLD produced 94 %; XLBG, 71 %; MAC, 55 %; and DC, only 35 %. Of shigellae, XLD found 89 %; MAC, 75 %; XLBG, 63 %; and DC, but 27 %.
