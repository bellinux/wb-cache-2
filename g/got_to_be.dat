It's your first game, your first big league experience—it was unbelievable to face that guy.|$|E

25|$|Andy Flower {{smashed the}} Gloucestershire Gladiators' bowlers all around The County Ground in Chelmsford {{as he and}} Ronnie Irani paired up for 139 to send Essex Eagles to a final score of 271 for 7. Flower hit 127 not out off 93 balls, as Upul Chandana {{especially}} <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> punished, conceding 64 runs from 9 overs. In reply, Alex Tudor snared {{out a couple of}} early wickets, Gloucestershire lost wickets at regular intervals, and even a quick hit-out from Chandana - who scored 32 off 30 balls - was not enough to take a win from the Eagles, their fifth of the season. Essex thus went top of the National League table along with Middlesex.|$|E

25|$|Michael Jackson {{made his}} debut {{at the age}} of six with the Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons), who were {{prominent}} performers during the 1970s. Jackson's early solo career that same decade included albums such as <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> There and Ben. His two follow-ups, Music & Me and Forever, Michael, failed to sell well.

Jackson's follow-ups, Bad, Dangerous, and , also became international successes.

500|$|At {{the heart}} of this scene is Cable's song [...] "You've <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> Carefully Taught", in which Cable realizes the sources of his own racism. [...] Its frank lyrics made it perhaps the most {{controversial}} element of the show. Michener recalled in his memoirs that a delegation of New Englanders had approached him after a New Haven tryout and urged him to recommend the song's removal to Rodgers and Hammerstein. [...] When Michener told Hammerstein, he laughed and replied, [...] "That's what the show is about!" [...] Boston drama critic Elliot Norton, after seeing the show in tryouts, strongly recommended its removal, or at least that Cable sing it less [...] "briskly", as there was much bigotry in Boston; Logan replied that that was all the more reason for leaving it unaltered. Several New York reviewers expressed discomfort with the song; Wolcott Gibbs wrote of [...] "something called 'You've <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> Taught', a poem in praise of tolerance that somehow I found a little embarrassing" [...] while John Mason Brown opined that he was [...] "somewhat distressed by the dragged-in didacticism of such a plea for tolerance as 'You've <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> Taught'". After the Broadway opening, Hammerstein received a large number of letters concerning [...] "You've <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> Carefully Taught". [...] Judging by the letters that remain among his papers in the Library of Congress, the reaction was mixed. One correspondent wrote [...] "What can I say to a man who writes, 'You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taught to hate and fear?'... Now that I know you, I feel that my informants didn't praise you enough." [...] Nevertheless, another wrote, [...] "I feel the inclusion of the song particularly in the album and to some extent in the show itself is not helpful to the cause of brotherhood, your intent to the contrary notwithstanding".|$|E

[...] The song begins with Carey publicly denouncing the existence of poverty and racism in the world, and she uses the bridge to shift the lyrics towards an uplifting and aspirational tone. Carey suggests we should be more tolerant of each other and not resort so readily to war in the lyrics [...] "Couldn't we accept each other / Can't we make ourselves aware." ...|$|E
