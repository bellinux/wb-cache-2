25|$|Chhattisgarh {{is one of}} the {{emerging}} states with relatively high growth rates of NSDP (8.2% vs. 7.1% All India over 2002–2008) and per capita NSDP (6.2% vs. 5.4% All India over 2002–2008). The growth rates of the said parameters are above the national averages and thus it appears that Chhattisgarh <b>is</b> <b>catching</b> up with other states in this respect. However, the state still has very low levels of per capita income as compared to the other states.|$|E
25|$|Along with dingos, {{introduced}} {{species such as}} foxes, feral cats, and both domestic and feral dogs, {{pose a threat to}} kangaroo populations. Kangaroos and wallabies are adept swimmers, and often flee into waterways if presented with the option. If pursued into the water, a large kangaroo may use its forepaws to hold the predator underwater so as to drown it. Another defensive tactic described by witnesses <b>is</b> <b>catching</b> the attacking dog with the forepaws and disembowelling it with the hind legs.|$|E
25|$|The {{same goes}} for {{readings}} of literary texts says Pommier. For example, Molière's Don Juan only pursues one love object for mediated reasons, not all of them, as Girard claims. Or again, Sancho Panza wants an island not because he <b>is</b> <b>catching</b> the bug of romanticism from Don Quixote, but {{because he has been}} promised one. And Pavel Pavlovitch, in Dostoevsky's Eternal Husband, has been married for ten years before Veltchaninov becomes his rival, so Veltchaninov is not in fact essential to Pavel's desire.|$|E

500|$|The opening {{theme of}} the game {{features}} a neo-Gregorian chant, which was performed in studio by a 135-voice choir. Much of the underscore music that plays when the player is exploring the game, rather than during cinematic scenes, is based upon that opening scene. The composers made use of silence in many scenes, to build up tension for moments of a [...] "pounce" [...] effect, creating the effect with music that something <b>is</b> <b>catching</b> the listener. They deliberately saved the most intense music for the final chapter of Phantasmagoria, when the game becomes the most intense. During some chase scenes, drums and low strings {{are used in the}} score to simulate a heartbeat, which grows louder and louder during more dangerous moments.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} episode, Ash Ketchum, {{a young boy}} from Pallet Town, turns 10 years old and is ready to acquire his first Pokémon. Hopeful to become a Pokémon Master, {{the night before he}} {{receives}} his starter Pokémon (either Squirtle, Charmander or Bulbasaur) he has a dream where he <b>is</b> <b>catching</b> a Pokémon and actually, while sleeping, physically breaks his alarm clock. Ash quickly runs to Professor Oak's lab, where he finds out all the starter Pokémon have been given away. Professor Oak tells Ash there is one more Pokémon, a Pikachu. At first, Pikachu largely ignores Ash's requests, shocking him frequently and refusing to be confined to the conventional method of Pokémon transportation, a Poké Ball. However, Ash puts himself in danger to defend Pikachu from a flock of wild Spearow, then rushes the electric mouse to a Pokémon Center. Through these demonstrations of respect and unconditional commitment to Pokémon, Pikachu warms up to Ash, and their friendship is formed. However, it still refuses to go into its Poké Ball. Soon after, Pikachu shows great power that sets it apart from Pokémon, and other Pikachu, which causes Team Rocket to constantly attempt to capture it in order to win favor from their boss, Giovanni. Only once had Ash almost released Pikachu, and that was in the episode [...] "Pikachu's Goodbye", because Ash thought Pikachu would be happier living in a colony of wild Pikachu, but Pikachu chose him instead. Pikachu also has his very own segment in the first two seasons called [...] "Pikachu's Jukebox", which included songs from 2.B.A. Master.|$|E

2500|$|In {{an attempt}} to revitalize the {{downtown}} area, a few youth organizations, such as the San Bernardino Generation Now, The Revolve Touch, and Sinderblocks, emerged. The groups plan to restore a sense of [...] "Pride of ownership" [...] to the city beginning with the Downtown Summer Fest in San Bernardino, creating attention for {{the beauty of the}} downtown district. This group uses catchy hashtags to grab the attention of many, such as #WeLoveSB14 and #WeLoveSanBernardino. The San Bernardino Generation Now movement <b>is</b> <b>catching</b> the attention of many as the city begins to rebuild and new businesses begin to look at the downtown area as an open canvas of opportunity.|$|E
2500|$|Although the People's Liberation Army Air Force is {{considered}} large, {{most of its}} fleet consists of older generation J-7 fighters (localized MiG-21s and Mig-21BIs), raising doubts over the PLAAF's ability to control Taiwan's airspace {{in the event of}} a conflict. Since mid-1990s PRC has been purchasing, and later localizing, SU-27 based fighters. There are over 170 of these Russian fighters and Chinese J11A variants. They have increased the effectiveness of PLAAF's Beyond Visual Range (BVR) capabilities. The introduction of 60 new-generation J10A fighters is anticipated to increase the PLAAF's firepower. PRC's acquisition of Russian Su30MKKs further enhanced the PLAAF's air-to-ground support ability. The ROC's air force, on the other hand, relies on Taiwan's fourth generation fighters, consisting of 150 US-built F-16 Fighting Falcons, approximately 60 French-built Mirage 2000-5s, and approximately 130 locally developed IDFs (Indigenous Defense Fighters). All of these ROC fighter jets are able to conduct BVR combat missions with BVR missiles, but the level of technology in mainland Chinese fighters <b>is</b> <b>catching</b> up. [...] Also the United States Defense Intelligence Agency has reported that few of Taiwan's 400 total fighters are operationally capable.|$|E

2500|$|FACTNet filed a lawsuit, and on September 14, 1995 a Federal {{judge ruled}} the seizure illegal because it {{violated}} FACTNet's {{right to free}} speech on the internet, and ordered the RTC to return all computers and files that were seized. [...] In his ruling in United States District Court, Judge John Kane stated: [...] "The public interest is best served by the free exchange of ideas." [...] Nevertheless, FACTNet states that it has incurred irreparable damage, as the secrecy of its documents had been violated by the RTC. [...] An attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation approved of the Judge's decision in the matter, stating: [...] "They certainly do {{not have the right to}} seize everything and to fish around. There seems to be this thought that things that are contained on a computer aren't subject to the same protections. I think the law <b>is</b> <b>catching</b> up." [...] Helena K. Kobrin a Church of Scientology attorney with the firm Moxon & Kobrin, defended the seizures of the computers, saying after the judge's decision: [...] "The decision yesterday was a very sad day for intellectual property owners and a very sad day for the Internet." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{ultimate}} {{driver of}} the stresses that cause earthquakes are the motions of the tectonic plates: material from the Earth's mantle rises at spreading centers, and moves out as plates of oceanic crust which eventually are subducted under the more buoyant plates of continental crust. Western Washington lies over the Cascadia subduction zone, where the Juan de Fuca Plate is subducting towards the east (see diagram, right). This is being obliquely overridden by the North American plate {{coming out of the}} northeast, which has formed a bend in the subducting plate and in the forearc basin above it. This bend has distorted the subducting slab into an arch that has lifted the Olympic Mountains and prevented them from subducting. For the past 50 million years or so (since the early Eocene epoch) these have been thrust by subduction up against the North Cascades ("fixed block" [...] in the diagram), which sit on the North American Plate. This forms a pocket or trough [...] what one local geologist calls the [...] "big hole between the mountains" [...] between the Cascades on the east and the Olympic Mountains and Willapa Hills on the west. This pocket <b>is</b> <b>catching</b> a stream of terranes (crustal blocks about 20 to 30km thick) which the Pacific plate is pushing up the western edge of North America, and in the process imparting a bit of clockwise rotation to southwestern Washington and most of Oregon; the result has been characterized as a train wreck. These terranes were covered by the basalts of the Crescent Formation (part of Siletzia). Folding and faulting has exposed these basalts in some places (black areas in diagram); the intervening basins have been filled by various sedimentary formations, some of which have been subsequently uplifted. Glacially deposited and shaped fill covers most of the lower elevations of Puget Sound. This is the Puget Lowland. The principal effects of this complex interplay of forces on the near-surface crust underlying the Puget Lowland are: ...|$|E
