40|$|In this paper, voltage sag {{compensation}} of {{point of common coupling}} (PCC) {{using a new}} structure of fault current limiter (FCL) is proposed. The proposed structure prevents voltage sag and phase-angle jump of the substation PCC after fault occurrence. This structure has a simple control method. Using the semiconductor switch (insulated-gate bipolar transistor or <b>gate</b> <b>turnoff</b> <b>thyristor</b> at dc current rout leads to fast operation of the proposed FCL and, consequently, dc reactor value is reduced. On the other hand, the proposed structure reduces the total harmonic distortion on load voltage and it has low ac losses in normal operation. As a result, other feeders, which are connected to the substation PCC, will have good power quality. Analytical analysis and simulation results using PSCAD/EMTDC software and experimental results are presented to validate the effectiveness of this structure...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Army Research Laboratory, Fort Monmouth, NJ, has {{developed}} and is installing two 3. 3 MW high speed {{solid state circuit}} breakers at the Army's Pulse Power Center. These circuit breakers will interrupt 4160 V three phase power mains in no more than 300 microseconds, two orders of magnitude faster than conventional mechanical contact type circuit breakers. These circuit breakers utilize <b>Gate</b> <b>Turnoff</b> <b>Thyristors</b> (GTO's) and are currently utility type devices using air cooling in an air conditioned enclosure. Future refinements include liquid cooling, either water or two phase organic coolant, and more advanced semiconductors. Each of these refinements promises a more compact, more reliable unit...|$|R
40|$|The HVDC {{converter}} control can destabilize torsional {{modes of}} nearby turbogenerators. The first experience of HVDC-turbine generator torsional interaction {{was observed in}} 1977 during field tests at Square Butte. The development of power semiconductors, specially insulated-gate bipolar transistors and <b>gate</b> <b>turnoff</b> <b>thyristors</b> (GTOs) {{has led to the}} small power HVDC transmission based on voltage-source converters (VSCs). The self-commutated VSC-based HVDC installations have several advantages compared to conventional HVDC-based online-commutated current source converter. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate and present the detailed analysis of subsynchronous resonance (SSR), arising from a VSC-based HVDC system connected close to generating units. The analysis considers different operating modes of the converters. Based on a case study, it is shown that the dc voltage control mode of VSC operation (rectifier/inverter) close to the generator units can contribute positive damping in the torsional-mode frequency range of interest. The investigations of SSR with VSC-based HVDC is carried out based on linear (damping torque and eigenvalue) analysis and nonlinear transient simulation. While the damping torque, eigenvalue analysis, and controller design are based on the D-Q model, the transient simulation considers the D-Q model and the three-phase detailed model of VSC using switching functions. The influence of the operating modes of the converters and effects of some important parameters, such as effective short circuit ratio and generator rating are investigated...|$|R
40|$|Inductive Pulsed Plasma Thruster (IPPT) pulse circuits, such {{as those}} needed to operate the Pulsed Inductive Thruster (PIT), are {{required}} to quickly switch capacitor banks operating at a period of s while conducting current at levels {{on the order of}} at least 10 kA. [1, 2] For all iterations of the PIT to date, spark gaps have been used to discharge the capacitor bank through an inductive coil. Recent availability of fast, highpower solid state switching devices makes it possible to consider the use of semiconductor switches in modern IPPTs. In addition, novel preionization schemes have led to a reduction in discharge energy per pulse for electric thrusters of this type, relaxing the switching requirements for these thrusters. [3, 4] Solid state switches offer the advantage of greater controllability and reliability, as well as decreased drive circuit dimensions and mass relative to spark gap switches. The use of solid state devices such as Integrated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs), <b>Gate</b> <b>Turnoff</b> <b>Thyristors</b> (GTOs) and SiliconControlled Rectifiers (SCRs) often involves the use of power diodes. These semiconductor devices may be connected antiparallel to the switch for protection from reverse current, or used to reduce power loss in a circuit by clamping off current ringing. In each case, higher circuit efficiency may be achieved by using a diode that is able to transition, or 'switch,' from the forward conducting state ('on' state) to the reverse blocking state ('off' state) in the shortest amount of time, thereby minimizing current ringing and switching losses. Silicon Carbide (SiC) PiN diodes offer significant advantages to conventional fastswitching Silicon (Si) diodes for high power and fast switching applications. A wider band gap results in a breakdown voltage 10 times that of Si, so that a SiC device may have a thinner drift region for a given blocking voltage. [5] This leads to smaller, lighter devices for high voltage applications, as well as reduced forward conduction losses, faster reverse recovery time (faster turnoff), and lowermagnitude reverse recovery current. In addition, SiC devices have lower leakage current as compared to their Si counterparts, and a high thermal conductivity, potentially allowing the former to operate at higher temperatures with a smaller, lighter heatsink (or no heatsink at all) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the turnoff physics in gate-assisted <b>turnoff</b> <b>thyristors</b> (GATT's) leads to a {{proposed}} mechanism involving the gate bias acting to prevent a forward voltage from appearing on the cathode rather than, as was previously thought, to sweep out excess carriers. It is shown that cathode shunting {{can be used in}} GATT's to virtually eliminate an important failure mode and to decrease the gate voltage needed to produce the desired improvement in turnoff time. Implications for designing GATT's are given, one being that a change in the lateral resistance of the p-base will have opposite effects depending on whether the cathode is shunted or not...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the great}} promise of carbon {{nanotube}} field effect transistors (CNT FETs) for applications in chemical and biochemical detection, a quantitative understanding of sensor responses is lacking. To explore {{the role of}} electrostatics in sensor transduction, experiments were conducted {{with a set of}} highly similar compounds designed to adsorb onto the CNT FET via a pyrene linker group and take on a set of known charge states under ambient conditions. Acidic and basic species were observed to induce threshold voltage shifts of opposite sign, consistent with gating of the CNT FET by local charges due to protonation or deprotonation of pyrene compounds by interfacial water. The magnitude of the gate voltage shift was controlled by the distance between the charged group and the CNT. Additionally, functionalization with an un-charged pyrene compound showed a threshold shift ascribed to its molecular dipole moment. This work illustrates a method to produce CNT FETs with controlled values of the <b>turnoff</b> <b>gate</b> voltage, and more generally, these results will inform the development of quantitative models for the response of CNT FET chemical and biochemical sensors.
