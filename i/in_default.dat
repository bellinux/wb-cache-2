5|$|The Ontario provincial {{government}} has quarrelled with 407ETR over toll rates and customer service, but is largely tied {{down by the}} lease contract. On February 2, 2004, the government delivered notice to 407ETR that they {{are considered to be}} <b>in</b> <b>default</b> of their contract because of 407ETR's decision to raise toll rates without first obtaining provincial clearance. The court's initial decision sided with 407ETR: on July 10, 2004, an independent arbitrator affirmed that 407ETR has the ability to raise toll rates without first consulting the government. The government filed an appeal of this decision but was overruled by an Ontario Superior Court decision released on January 6, 2005; however, a subsequent ruling by the Ontario Court of Appeal on June 13, 2005 granted the government permission to appeal the decision.|$|E
5|$|Both Block 37 and The Mills Corporation have {{histories}} of financial difficulties. Block 37 had been demolished in 1989 for a hotly contested redevelopment plan under the then new Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley. The debates included {{the demolition of}} the Chicago Landmark McCarthy Building, which proceeded after the Illinois Supreme Court decided private preservation groups did not have standing to challenge the city's decision. Once the site was cleared, the initial redevelopment plan fell through, as did several subsequent plans, leaving the block vacant and undeveloped for nearly a generation. The Mills Corporation has itself been in financial difficulty in the past. This reputation and changing financial climate caused a delay in 2006 as contractors feared not getting paid. During the construction, cost overruns and delays have forced the city of Chicago and the Chicago Transit Authority {{to make up for}} a shortfall of over $100million. In November 2009, the developer was declared <b>in</b> <b>default</b> and CB Richard Ellis was named receiver.|$|E
5|$|This effusive {{display of}} respect and remembrance {{on the part of}} Ranavalona's friends was not {{mirrored}} by subsequent actions of the French colonial administration in Madagascar. In June 1925, eight years after the queen's death, the Governor-General of Algeria informed the Governor-General of Madagascar by letter that payments for the maintenance of Ranavalona's tomb were <b>in</b> <b>default.</b> He urged the colonial government in Madagascar to provide funds for the upkeep of the dilapidated tomb, emphasizing that such neglect was unworthy of the queen's memory and the government of France alike. The request was twice refused and the tomb was never refurbished. In November 1938, Ranavalona's remains were exhumed and re-interred in the tomb of Queen Rasoherina at the Rova of Antananarivo in Madagascar. A fire on the night of 6 November 1995 severely damaged the royal tombs and destroyed most of the other buildings at the site. The lamba-wrapped remains of Ranavalona III were the only ones that could be saved from the flames. These have since been re-interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga.|$|E

40|$|I address whether {{speculation}} <b>in</b> credit <b>default</b> swaps {{is likely}} to have driven up Eurozone sovereign borrowing costs.

I discuss how regulations that severely restrict speculation <b>in</b> credit <b>default</b> swap markets could have the unintended consequences of reducing market liquidity, raising trading execution costs for investors who are not speculating, and lowering the quality of information provided by credit default swap rates regarding the credit qualities of sovereign issuers. Regulations that severely restrict speculation <b>in</b> credit <b>default</b> swap markets could, as a result, increase sovereign borrowing costs. I briefl y suggest alternative regulatory approaches. ...|$|R

25|$|However, {{despite the}} {{tendency}} to characterize payday loan default rates as high, several researchers have noted {{that this is an}} artifact of the normal short term of the payday product, and that during the term of loans with longer periods there are frequently points where the borrower is <b>in</b> <b>default</b> and then becomes current again. Actual charge offs are no more frequent than with traditional forms of credit, as the majority of payday loans are rolled over into new loans repeatedly without any payment applied to the original principal.|$|E
