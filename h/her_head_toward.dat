60|$|Without turning <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> him, Eleanor {{addressed}} Trowse.|$|E
60|$|She slowly turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> him, and a faint sigh escaped her.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, we're English. Our husbands {{work in the}} quarry. That's {{my little}} palace." [...] The woman nodded <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> the cottage.|$|E
60|$|The Princess {{opened her}} eyes {{at the sound of}} her maid's approach. She turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> impatiently <b>toward</b> the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] she answered, turning <b>her</b> <b>head</b> away <b>toward</b> the window, {{and looking}} out {{mechanically}} at the falling rain. [...] "Only my own thoughts." ...|$|R
60|$|Perfectly unimpressed by this {{harrowing}} narrative, Francine turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> lazily <b>toward</b> the house. The {{door was}} thrown {{open at the}} same moment. A lithe little person rapidly descended the steps {{that led to the}} lawn.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{friends have}} you with you to-day, Jaaf?" [...] inquired my grandmother, inclining <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> us pedlers graciously, at the same time; a salutation that my uncle Ro and myself rose hastily to acknowledge.|$|E
60|$|He ceased speaking, almost choked now {{by his own}} eloquence, and the rapidity {{with which}} the lying words escaped his lips. And Gilda slowly turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> the prisoner, and met that subtly-ironical, good-humoured glance again.|$|E
60|$|As {{the door}} closed on him, Delly dropped on her knees. She lifted <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> the ceiling, but dropped it again, as if tyrannically awed downward, and bent it low over, till her whole form tremulously cringed to the floor.|$|E
60|$|As Luke Peterson was {{now doing}} fairly well, {{all of the}} others ran on deck, and soon the Swallow was {{in pursuit of the}} schooner. At first but little could be seen of the Peacock, but when the sun came up they saw <b>her</b> plainly, <b>heading</b> <b>toward</b> the northwest.|$|R
6000|$|... "Did I, too, look sinister?" [...] said Mrs. Travers, turning <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{slightly}} <b>toward</b> <b>her</b> husband. [...] "And yet I {{assure you}} that I was glad, profoundly glad, to see you safe from danger for a time at least. To gain time is everything. [...] ." ...|$|R
60|$|With {{the words}} she lifted Tato high above <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and turned <b>toward</b> the pit--that terrible cleft in the rocks which was {{believed}} to have no bottom.|$|R
6000|$|She {{stopped with}} lighted eyes on him. [...] "Is {{it because you}} think you owe it--" [...] and she paused, still with the {{heightened}} colour in her cheek, then went on--"that you've spoken to me as you did there?" [...] She tossed <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> the lake.|$|E
60|$|Jeanne's lips quivered for a moment. Her {{eyes were}} fixed upon the distant figure, {{motionless}} now, upon the raised sandbanks. Kate had turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> the Red Hall, and was looking {{at one of the}} windows there as though her eyes would pierce the distance.|$|E
60|$|Once {{more she}} turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> the young Englishman and {{challenged}} a straight look from his eyes. He did not waver {{and she was}} satisfied. Her instinct had not misled her, for he expressed no astonishment, only a sort of dog-like gratitude and joy as, having returned her gaze quite firmly, he now slowly raised his arm bringing her hand on a level with his lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{have you}} been here a great while?" [...] she asked, turning <b>her</b> <b>head</b> slowly <b>toward</b> Colville, and looking at him with a little {{difficulty}} she had in raising her eyelids; when she was younger the glance that shyly stole from under the covert of their lashes was like a gleam of sunshine, and it was still like a gleam of paler sunshine.|$|R
6000|$|While {{the other}} men seemed to reply in kind: [...] "Oh, rats, we're a makin' it. <b>Head</b> <b>her</b> <b>toward</b> that bush. Don't get scared--trust me--I'll sling her ashore!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Bird Girl is cast {{in bronze}} and stands 50 in tall. She {{is the image}} of a young girl wearing a simple dress and a sad or contemplative expression, with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> tilted <b>toward</b> <b>her</b> left shoulder. She stands straight, her elbows propped against her waist as she holds up two bowls out from her sides. The bowls are often {{described}} by viewers as [...] "bird feeders".|$|R
60|$|The winch {{began to}} rattle {{and an hour}} or two later Grahame went up to the bridge while the anchor was broken out. When the men were stowing it the engines throbbed and the Miranda turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> open water. In another half hour the {{propeller}} stopped and the captain turned to his guests with a grin as the Enchantress's gig came alongside.|$|E
6000|$|The young girl's clear, scrutinizing eyes softened; her red {{resolute}} lips trembled {{slightly and}} then parted, the upper one hovering {{a little to}} one side over her white teeth. It was Nelly's own peculiar smile, and its serious piquancy always thrilled him. But she drew a little farther back from his brightening eyes, her hands still curled behind her, and said, with the faintest coquettish toss of <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> the hill: [...] "If {{you want to see}} father, you'd better hurry up." ...|$|E
60|$|She disappeared, and the Princess {{lay still}} upon her couch, thinking. Soon she heard steps outside, {{and with a}} little sigh she turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> the door. The man who entered was tall, and of the {{ordinary}} type of well-born Englishmen. He was carefully dressed, and his somewhat scanty hair was arranged to the best advantage. His features were hard and lifeless. His eyes were just a shade too close together. The maid ushered him in and withdrew at once.|$|E
60|$|A {{moment later}} the two had mounted and were moving slowly across the moon-bathed plain. The girl turned <b>her</b> pony's <b>head</b> {{straight}} <b>toward</b> the jungle. It was {{in the direction of}} the roaring of the hungry lion.|$|R
40|$|Photograph shows a {{woman in}} a classically-inspired gown with a wreath on <b>her</b> <b>head</b> leaning <b>toward</b> a naked child holding leaves in one hand. Published title. Signed with artist's monogram. DLCForms part of: Artistic {{photographs}} collected by Frances Benjamin Johnston in the Frances Benjamin Johnston Collection. DLCGift; Frances Benjamin Johnston; 1948.

50|$|In Mermaid (1911, watercolour, 25 x 36 cm), {{the subject}} {{sits on a}} rock by the seashore. The water is turquoise, and the sky filled with purplish clouds. The mermaid tilts <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and looks <b>toward</b> the viewer, as she {{arranges}} her long blonde tresses.|$|R
6000|$|Had twin thunderbolts fallen {{through the}} twin {{roofs of the}} twin palaces and struck the twin Ki and the twin Ki-Ki upon their twin heads it would have created no more stupendous a {{sensation}} than did this remark. Never before had any two halves of a twin of the Land of Twi thought differently or spoken differently. Indeed, it startled the two maidens themselves {{as much as it}} did their hearers, for each one turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> the other and, {{for the first time in}} her life, looked into the other's face! ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{laughed with}} him, {{and they walked}} along the L bestridden avenue, exhilarated by their escape from murder and suicide in that cellar, toward the nearest cross town track, which they meant to take home to their hotel. [...] "Now to-night {{we will go to}} the theatre," [...] she said, [...] "and get this whole house {{business}} out of our minds, and be perfectly fresh for a new start in the morning." [...] Suddenly she clutched his arm. [...] "Why, did you see that man?" [...] and she signed with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> a decently dressed person who walked beside them, next the gutter, stooping over as if to examine it, and half halting at times.|$|E
60|$|She {{stopped the}} first empty cab that passed her; told {{the driver to}} go to New Street, Spring Gardens; and promised to double his fare if he reached his {{destination}} by a given time. The man earned the money--more than earned it, as the event proved. Magdalen had not taken ten steps in advance along New Street, walking toward St. James's Park, before {{the door of a}} house beyond her opened, and a lady in mourning came out, accompanied by two little girls. The lady also took the direction of the Park, without turning <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> Magdalen as she descended the house step. It mattered little; Magdalen's heart looked through her eyes, and told her that she saw Norah.|$|E
6000|$|With {{a gentle}} {{inclination}} of <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> she turned <b>toward</b> other guests--looked back--and with a last little courteous attention offered to him, said, [...] "If you like music, Mr. Penrose, I {{advise you to}} go to the picture gallery. They are going to play a Quartet by Mozart." ...|$|R
50|$|Prowler {{tries to}} escape Electro's wrath in Alcatraz, which proves {{difficult}} with her powers and his dying body. Using his weapons, the gift shop, and his strategic thinking, Prowler manages {{to defeat the}} simple-minded Electro. When he makes it outside, he is found by Julia, who takes him on <b>her</b> boat and <b>heads</b> <b>toward</b> New U Technologies to get his New U Pills.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wilt thou not speak, Isabel?" [...] said Pierre, terrified at her frozen, {{immovable}} aspect, yet too terrified {{to manifest}} his own terror to her; and still coming slowly near her. She slightly raised one arm, {{as if to}} grasp some support; then turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> slowly sideways <b>toward</b> the door by which she had entered; then her dry lips slowly parted--"My bed; lay me; lay me!" ...|$|R
60|$|He arose and began, {{in a few}} well-chosen {{phrases that}} carried an {{undertone}} of faint irony, to introduce Ernest. Colonel Van Gilbert was subtly facetious in his introduction of the social reformer {{and member of the}} working class, and the audience smiled. It made me angry, and I glanced at Ernest. The sight of him made me doubly angry. He did not seem to resent the delicate slurs. Worse than that, he {{did not seem to be}} aware of them. There he sat, gentle, and stolid, and somnolent. He really looked stupid. And for a moment the thought rose in my mind, What if he were overawed by this imposing array of power and brains? Then I smiled. He couldn't fool me. But he fooled the others, just as he had fooled Miss Brentwood. She occupied a chair right up to the front, and several times she turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> one or another of her CONFRERES and smiled her appreciation of the remarks.|$|E
6000|$|After {{that they}} went a {{considerable}} ways in silence, and then by and by Lynette turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> Sir Gareth and spake, saying: [...] "Sirrah, knowest thou whither this path upon which we travel will lead us?" [...] And Sir Gareth said, [...] "Nay, Lady, I know not." [...] "Alas for thee," [...] quoth Lynette, [...] "for I am to tell thee that this path leadeth toward a certain ford of a river, which same ford is guarded by two strong and powerful knights who are brothers. Of these two knights I heard yesternight at the priory {{that they are very}} savage robbers, and that, of those who would pass the ford of the river, some they slay and others they rob or else make captive for the sake of ransom. Now I am making my way toward that place where are these two knights in the belief that they may rid me of thee. So be thou advised whilst there is yet time; withdraw thee from this adventure and return whither thou hast come, or else, mayhap, a very great deal of harm may befall thee." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will find}} paper," [...] I said, [...] "in the drawer of your table, {{and there are}} pens, of {{different}} sorts, in that tray." [...] She opened the drawer, took out some paper, and selected a pen, all without turning <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> me. Having broken the ice, I now felt impelled to deliver a short lecture on my requirements; but how could I say what I required without knowing what manner of person it was of whom I required it? I therefore postponed the lecture, and determined to begin work without further delay, as probably {{that would be the}} best way to put us both at our ease. But it had been more than two weeks since I had done any work, and I could not remember what it was that I had been dictating, or endeavoring to dictate, to the lady with the malarial husband. I therefore thought it well to begin at a fresh point, and to leave the gap to be filled up afterward. I felt quite sure, when last at work, I had been treating of the south of France, and had certainly not reached Marseilles. I therefore decided to take a header for Marseilles, and into Marseilles I plunged.|$|E
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of Ynez B. De Botillere, [s. d. ]. She {{is standing at}} center with her body facing to the right at and <b>her</b> <b>head</b> turned slightly <b>toward</b> the camera. She is wearing a long black dress that is pleated {{at the bottom and}} has long sleeves. Her dark hair is down and reaches to her calves. She is wearing a black flowered headpiece. Her hands are resting on a pedestal at right, and a painted backdrop of a tree is visible at left...|$|R
60|$|With {{a gesture}} that gave her a new insight into Ditmar, reverently he took the picture from her hand and placed {{it back in the}} drawer. She was stirred, almost to tears, and moved away from him a little, as though to lessen by {{distance}} the sudden attraction he had begun to exert: yet she lingered, half leaning, half sitting {{on the corner of the}} big desk, <b>her</b> <b>head</b> bent <b>toward</b> him, <b>her</b> eyes filled with light. She was wondering whether he could ever love a woman as he loved this man of whom he had spoken, whether he could be as true to a woman. His own attitude seemed never to have been more impersonal, but she had ceased to resent it; something within her whispered that she was the conductor, the inspirer..|$|R
5000|$|The {{video was}} filmed at Old Tucson Studios in Tucson, Arizona. During {{the filming of}} the video, a wooden crate was blown away 40 feet from the explosion, landing near Lawrence. As a result, Atlantic Records, Lawrence's record company at the time, decided not to do any more explosions in his videos, citing that [...] "it was too real." [...] On the explosion, Lawrence said [...] "I could feel wood and debris hitting me on the back. My wife Frances was tied up and gagged over my {{shoulder}} with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> pointed right <b>toward</b> the building, and the hair on top of <b>her</b> <b>head</b> was singed. When I put her down, we just hugged each other real tight. It scared us to death." ...|$|R
