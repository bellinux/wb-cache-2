40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the trial}} of the Allegation of Unconstitutionality number 4277 -DF under the light of Fraser-Honneth debate. We intend to investigate, according to Fraser-Honneth debate, whether such theoretical frameworks are consistent with the challenges able to face forms of judicialization expressed in {{the trial of}} the Allegation of Unconstitutionality number 4277 -DF by the Brazilian Supreme Court, criticizing speeches implied in votes of Justices, insusceptible to desestabilize the binary sexual identities. Through a monographic method (case study) and using jurisprudential research about the votes of the Brazilian Supreme Court’s Justices, we conclude that the vote of Justice Carlos Ayres de Brito, despite its progressive content, also establishes a binary structure and certain speeches setting heteronormative standards that impede participatory parity of gay couples. We hold that the ideia of “Fraternal Constitutionalism”, mentioned by the Minister, is linked to affirmative remedies, not transformative. We argue that the theory of Fraser reveals more theoretical consistency to criticize the argumentative strategy of the Justices, especially given the emphasis on transformative remedies and desconstructive proposal. The research will be developed by the phenomenological hermeneutical method and analytical induction.

População: dados referentes a um grupo de 42 crianças com uma média de idade de 9 anos com 4 dentes afetados pela doença cárie, em média. Utilizou-se a técnica de documentação indireta através de pesquisa documental. Resultados: IPV-inicial = 29 % contra IPV-final = 11 % e ISG-inicial = 13 % contra ISG-final = 5 %. As variações encontradas foram estatisticamente significantes ao nível de 1 % pelo teste estatístico aplicado. O programa de promoção de saúde analisado mostrou-se eficaz em relação ao controle de placa, reduzindo o IPV a um nível mais aceitável. Embora o ISG tenha sofrido uma redução considerável, a presença de sangramento gengival no final do ciclo de atendimento requer uma melhor abordagem da motivação do paciente em realizar a higiene bucal rotineiramente. The {{purpose of}} this research was to evaluate the reduction of the VPI (visible plaque index) and of the GBI (gum bleeding index) in children seen at a unit of SUS, in the state of Rio de Janeiro. A comparative and statistical procedure (t-test, by means of the GMC program) was employed in order to assess the variation between initial and final mean VPI and GBI values. Initial values were registered {{in the beginning of the}} assistance program, and final values were registered after the children had participated in health promotion activities, which included weekly supervised brushing sessions, individual dietary guidance, collective instructive activities in which parents were present, adjusting of the oral environment, as well as restorative and surgical dental care, during an average period of six months.

40|$|No final do século XX, as empresas latino-americanas foram inseridas em um ambiente de competitividade internacional - devido à consolidação das reformas neoliberais, o processo de abertura econômica e a estabilização monetária e com isso tornou-se necessário buscar ganhos de produtividade associados à redução de custos. Diante deste cenário e visto que as empresas de micro e pequeno porte sempre tiveram um importante papel nas economias latinas, no que se refere à geração de emprego e renda, o auxílio do Estado por meio de políticas públicas de apoio torna-se fundamental, principalmente no atendimento de suas necessidades mais prementes como o crédito facilitado, tributação diferenciada e capacitação. Assim, o objetivo deste trabalho é analisar, no período de 1998 a 2003, o impacto dessas políticas, mediante uma correlação com as variáveis de desempenho das MPEs número de estabelecimentos e empregos; total de vendas anuais; vendas anuais por empresa e por empregado - no Brasil e no Chile. Para realizar esta análise, inicialmente, recorremos aos autores clássicos do pensamento econômico os quais destacam, diretamente ou indiretamente, questões pertinentes as MPEs. A partir daí, estas são inseridas no cenário econômico latino-americano e então, busca-se delimitá-las nas economias brasileira e chilena, bem como as políticas públicas aplicadas a este porte de empresa. A metodologia utilizada neste trabalho foi de pesquisa bibliográfica e quantitativa. Os métodos de procedimento foram comparativos e estatísticos, tendo como base a técnica de documentação indireta. Como resultado do trabalho pode-se afirmar que é verdadeira a hipótese levantada na pesquisa, ou seja, que as políticas públicas de apoio às MPEs geram impactos positivos no desempenho das empresas na economia.

Before this scenery and considering the fact that the micro and small companies had always had {{an important role in the}} Latin economy, concerning the employment creation and income, the aid of the State through public politics of support becomes fundamental, mainly in the service of their more pressing needs as the facilitated credit, differentiated taxation and training. Like this, the objective of this work is to analyze, in the period from 1998 to 2003, the impact of these politics, by a correlation with the variables of acting of small businesses - number of establishments and jobs; total of annual sales; annual sales for company and for employee - in Brazil and in Chile. To accomplish this analysis, initially, we fell back upon the classic authors of the economical thought which highlight direct or indirectly pertinent subjects small businesses.

Há ainda o aspecto da melhoria da qualidade das instituições públicas, em virtude do aumento de investimentos dos governos no seu sistema educacional. Para fazer frente a essa realidade é preciso mudar-se alguns conceitos, os quais consideram que empresas ou instituições do mesmo ramo de atuação devem ser concorrentes; ao contrário, devem adotar estratégias e ações conjuntas, para atuarem em Rede de Cooperação. Para as escolas sinodais da Região Noroeste do RS, essa necessidade evidencia-se, razão pela qual a presente pesquisa buscou analisar os fatores de competitividade estratégico-empresariais de cinco escolas sinodais da Região Noroeste do RS, através da aplicação de pesquisas entre seus gestores e entre os clientes externos de suas escolas. Na metodologia, utilizou-se o método de abordagem e de procedimentos, e técnicas de documentação direta e indireta. O estudo foi o descritivo e as abordagens utilizadas na pesquisa foram a qualitativa e a quantitativa. Dentre os aspectos pesquisados, buscou-se avaliar os maiores gaps (intervalos) entre a pesquisa com os gestores e a pesquisa com os clientes externos (pais ou responsáveis), os quais foram identificados e analisados. Avaliaram-se também, os aspectos considerados como pontos fortes e como pontos fracos das escolas sinodais, por escola e conjuntamente. Na análise do conjunto das escolas, conclui-se que as mesmas influenciam seus clientes, principalmente pela qualidade do ensino e qualificação dos professores, pela proposta pedagógica e curricular, pela eficiência do ensino e pelas opções extracurriculares de cursos. Na ótica dos gestores, os mesmo julgam que seus clientes externos optam pelas escolas que dirigem, principalmente pela eficiência e qualidade do ensino e qualificação dos professores, pela preferência por escola particular, pelas opções extracurriculares de cursos, pela proposta pedagógica e curricular e pela inserção comunitária. O resultado das análises direciona para quais fatores de competitividade estratégico-empresariais precisam ser potencializados, para que essas escolas possam adotar, futuramente, estratégias e ações como Rede de Cooperação. The {{growth of}} competition, {{the opening of}} the markets and the {{expansion}} of the education section provide new challenges in the administration of the school institutions. There is also the aspect of quality improvement of public institutions, because of the increase of governments' investments in their education system. According to this reality, it is necessary to change some concepts, which consider that companies or institutions of the same branch of performance should be competitive; on the contrary, they should adopt strategies and united actions, for acting in the Cooperation Net. For Sinodal schools of the Northwest Region of Rio Grande do Sul state, this need is evidenced, reasons for which this present research looked for analyzing the strategical-enterprise factors of competitiveness of 5 Sinodal schools of the Northwest Region of RS, through the application of researches among their managers and among the external customers of their schools. In the methodology, the approach method and procedures were used, and techniques of direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>documentation.</b> The study was descriptive, and the approaches used in the research were the qualitative and the quantitative. Among the researched aspects, it was looked for evaluating the largest "gaps" (intervals) with the research of the managers and the research with the external customers (parents or responsible), which were identified and analyzed. It was also evaluated the aspects considered as load points and about weak points of the Sinodal schools, in each school, and jointly. In the analysis of the group of schools, it is ended that the same ones influence their customers, mainly, for the quality of the teaching and the teachers' qualification, for the pedagogic and curricular proposal, for the efficiency of the teaching and for the extracurricular options of courses.

O lÃdico Ã entendido como uma manifestaÃÃo humana, histÃrica e {{cultural}}. O âbrincar ou jogarâ faz parte da histÃria e da construÃÃo cultural humana e as narrativas sÃo utilizadas pelo homem para expressar e entender o mundo. Nesta pesquisa se considera os estudos da EstÃtica da RecepÃÃo, a relaÃÃo dinÃmica entre autor, obra e leitor. Tradicionalmente, narrativas sÃo contadas por meio de diversas formas artÃsticas como o romance, a mÃsica, o teatro, o cinema, a poesia, entre outros. No entanto, um meio mais recente proporciona novas experiÃncias para os que tÃm contato com as histÃrias dessas narrativas: os games eletrÃnicos. Sabemos o que esperar de narrativas mais tradicionais, entretanto, como ocorre a experiÃncia do interator, conceito de Janet Murray (2003), com um game eletrÃnico? Esse entÃo se destaca como objetivo geral desta pesquisa. A indicaÃÃo do olhar para o ato de jogar Ã comparada ao de ler, e diante da escolha dessa metÃfora o game seria um livro. A discussÃo do trabalho estÃ ancorada nos moldes dos estudos comparados e considera aspectos da ludologia e narratologia. A pesquisa enfoca o mÃtodo comparativo, para estabelecer relaÃÃes entre os procedimentos artÃsticos. Literatura, cinema e games sÃo evidenciados por meio da documentaÃÃo indireta, envolvendo estudos bibliogrÃficos. Arte e tecnologia sÃo temas de reflexÃo e anÃlise. Estudiosos como Couchot (2003) entendem que o game consiste em um fenÃmeno cultural tecnolÃgico que tem ganhado cada vez mais espaÃo na sociedade. Pesquisas mostram que muitas pessoas, de diversas faixas etÃrias, mas principalmente jovens, passam mais tempo jogando no computador ou consoles que assistindo televisÃo. AlÃm de Murray e Couchot, essa pesquisa tambÃm se apoia nos pressupostos teÃricos de autores como Umberto Eco (1994, 2005), que trata sobre a produÃÃo, recepÃÃo e comunicaÃÃo, CÃndido (2007), sobre a personagem ficcional, Bakhtin (2003), que estudou questÃes de estÃtica de criaÃÃo artÃstica, e ainda Huizinga (2012), que analisou o jogo como elemento de cultura, entre outros. Outro objetivo dessa pesquisa consiste em o uso da mÃscara pelo interator, uma representaÃÃo do virtual de si que se visualiza no herÃi ou personagem avatar. Como resultado da pesquisa o game Ã apresentado como um novo meio de se contar histÃrias onde a personagem protagonista Ã o interatorThe {{theme of}} the dissertation unfolds {{in the study of}} fictional narratives in games and how they are created, as well as the impact on the imagination. The playfulness is understood as a human, historical and cultural event. The "playâ is part of human history and cultural construction and narratives are used by humans to express themselves and to understand the world. This research considers the studies of Aesthetics of Reception, the dynamic relationship among author, work and reader. Traditionally narratives are told through various art forms such as romance, music, theater, film, poetry, among others. However, a more recent medium provides new experiences for those who have contact with the stories of these narratives: the electronic games. We know what to expect from more traditional narratives, however, how does the experience of the interactor, concept by Janet Murray (2003), with an electronic game occur? This then highlights the general objective of this research. The view of the act of playing is compared to the act of reading, and considering this choice of metaphor the game would be a book. A discussion of the work is based on the comparative studies and considers aspects of ludology and narratology. The research focuses on the comparative method to establish relations among artistic procedures. Literature, film and games are evidenced by <b>indirect</b> <b>documentation</b> involving bibliographic studies. Art and technology are themes of reflection and analysis. Scholars like Couchot (2003) argue that the game consists of a technological cultural phenomenon that has gained more space in society. Researches show that many people of different ages, but especially young people, spend more time playing computer games or consoles than watching television. In addition to Murray and Couchot, this research also supports the theoretical assumptions of authors such as Umberto Eco (1994, 2005), who deals with the production, reception and communication, Candido (2007), about the fictional character, Bakhtin (2003), who studied questions about aesthetics of artistic creation, and also Huizinga (2012) who analyzed the game as an element of culture, among others. Another goal of this research is the study of the mask used by the interactor, a representation of the virtual self that sees oneself as the hero character or avatar. As a result of this search the game is presented as a new way of storytelling where the main character is the interacto...|$|E
