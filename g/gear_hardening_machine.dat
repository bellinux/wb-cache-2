If they are constructed in local, the industries can utilize them commonly and easily. As the machines are designed and constructed {{in accordance with the}} desired products, the quality of products is higher and the products can be used efficiently. In the study of Design and Construction of Induction <b>Hardening</b> <b>Machine,</b> the design of work coil is presented. A small model induction <b>hardening</b> <b>machine</b> is designed for the output power 5 kW and operation frequency 35 kHz.

Due to the bigger loads based on the higher megawatt output per turbine gears especially at slewing bearings need to be hardened. Rising demands for better gear qualities and higher loads require a hard <b>machining</b> of these <b>hardened</b> <b>gears.</b> The development of special cutting materials for geometrically well-defined cutting edge processes enables the manufactures to mill these <b>gears</b> in <b>hardened</b> condition on standard milling machines. The process of milling <b>hardened</b> <b>gears</b> needs control of the surface integrity of the tooth flanks. The generation of white etching areas must be avoided and can be influenced by process parameters (e. g. cutting speed and feed rate). Preferably compressive residual stresses should be generated in the surface and sub-surface of the tooth flank.

Most learning methods, however, {{have not been}} designed with security in mind and thus are vulnerable to different types of attacks.

Concurrently, a different line of research has tackled a very similar problem: In digital watermarking information are embedded in a signal {{in the presence of}} an adversary. As a consequence, this research field has also extensively studied techniques for attacking and defending watermarking methods. The two research communities have worked in parallel so far, unnoticeably developing similar attack and defense strategies. This paper is a first effort to bring these communities together. To this end, we present a unified notation of black-box attacks against machine learning and watermarking that reveals the similarity of both settings.

In this paper, the effect of tool wear on surface integrity and its impact on fatigue performance of Inconel 718 alloy (45 ± 1 HRC) by end milling using PVD coated tools are studied. The evolutions of surface integrity including surface roughness, microstructure, and microhardness were characterized at three levels of tool flank wear (VB = 0, 0. 1 mm, 0. 2 mm). At each level of tool flank wear, the effects of cutting speed, feed, and radial depth-of-cut on surface integrity were investigated respectively. End milling can produce surface finish between 0. 1 μm and 0. 3 μm under most of the conditions. Roughness is generally higher in step-over direction than feed direction. No obvious white layer is observed in subsurface microstructure. The machined surface is significantly work-hardened due to the dominant mechanical loading. Four-point bending fatigue test shows that none of the milled samples failed within four million cycles. Fatigue endurance limits of the machined samples at different reliability levels were calculated and correlated with the experimentally determined fatigue life...|$|R

Laser beam hardening has been established as the standard technology for increasing strength and lifetime of cutting edges and deep drawing tools. Laser cladding can be applied advantageously as a repair technology for tools. But {{more important is the}} application as »negative milling«-technology for fast design changes during the fitting loops of the tools. Once made at external specialists these technologies are getting integrated in manufacturing lines of tool makers. Fraunhofer IWS developed systems and components for applying these technologies. Automated processing supported by measuring and control systems reduce existing application barriers at operators who are well skilled in mechanical treatment but less experienced with heat treatment and cladding. Since laser beam hardening and cladding is frequently necessary in the same line machine costs can be reduced if both processes share a laser. The optimum beam quality for both processes is quite similar and can be delivered by modern fiber coupled high power diode lasers.
