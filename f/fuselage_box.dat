5000|$|Development of the company's first design, the W.A.R. Focke-Wulf 190, {{commenced}} in 1973, {{with the}} first flight following in 1974. The aircraft are all half-scale World War II fighter aircraft replicas, based on a common design, consisting of a wooden <b>fuselage</b> <b>box</b> shape and wooden spar wing. Polyurethane foam was then used to create the different aircraft shapes and details. The foam was then covered in a high-strength laminating fabric and epoxy-resin. The series all share a common conventional landing gear design that is electrically retractable. The aircraft were initially powered by 1600 cc Volkswagen air cooled engines of [...] using Lloyd Patner's gear reduction units driving 3-blade Fahlin props, but later Continental O-200 and Lycoming O-235s were used along with the Rotec R2800 radial engine.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} problems, which solved during the design of {{transport}} category aircraft, is problem of analysis of the stress distribution in the strengthened fuselage frames structure. Existing integral methods of stress analysis {{does not allow for}} the mutual influence of the deformation {{of a large number of}} elements. The most effective method of solving the problem of analysis of deformations influence on the stress distribution of structure is finite element method, which is a universal method for analyzing stress distribution arbitrary constructions. This article describes the features of the finite element model synthesis of the strengthened fuselage frames structure of the aircraft fuselage transport category. It is shown that the finite element model of strengthened frames can be synthesized by attaching additional finite element models of the reinforcing elements to the base finite element model which is built by algorithm which is developed for normal frame. For each reinforcing element developed a separate class of finite element model synthesis algorithm. The method of synthesis of finite element model of strengthened frame, which are described in this article, developed for object-oriented information technology implemented in an object-oriented data management system "SPACE". Finite-element models of the reinforcing elements are included in the finite element model of the <b>fuselage</b> <b>box</b> after the formation of a regular finite element model of the <b>fuselage</b> <b>box.</b> As the source data for the synthesis of finite element models of the reinforcing elements used the coordinates of the boundary sections nodes of existing finite element models of conventional frames. Reinforcing elements belong to the group of irregular structural elements that connect regular elements of the cross set with different elements that are not intended for the perception and transmission of loads. The only exceptions are the vertical amplification increasing the stiffness of frames in a direction parallel to the axis OY. Source data input for the synthesis of finite element models of the reinforcing elements can occur only through the individual user interfaces that supported by objects of the corresponding classes. Structure of user interfaces depends on the number and type of additional data that required for the synthesis of finite element models of the reinforcing elements. For example, for the synthesis of structures of finite element models of horizontal beams that support the floor of cargo cabin, you must specify the distance between the upper surface of the beam and the horizontal axis of the fuselage, as well as the height of the beam section. For the synthesis of the structure of the finite element model of vertical reinforcing element is enough to specify the distance between the its inner belt and the a vertical axis of symmetry of the fuselage. And in both cases you must to specify a reference to the basic finite element model, by selecting from a list of frame designations. List of frames, as well as links to objects containing the appropriate finite-element models, must be transmitted from an object which references to the level of decomposition, in which the general model of the <b>fuselage</b> <b>box</b> is created. Finite-element models of the reinforcing elements include two groups of nodes. The first group is taken from an array of nodes, which is transmitted from the base finite element model. The second group is formed by the synthesis algorithm of finite element model of the selected class reinforcing element. Therefore, the synthesis of finite element models of the reinforcing elements starts with the formation of their local model versions. On the basis of these models are formed temporary copies, which are transmitted to the general finite element model of the box. This should be considered when developing of data conversion algorithm of data copying from a local finite element model to the temporary copy. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that this method improves the quality of the design of the aircraft fuselage, increasing the amount of structure variant number and reduce the likelihood of errors. ??????????? ????? ??????? ????????? ?????????????????? ?????? ?????????? ?????????, ????? ????????????? ????????? ??????? ?????????????????? ??????? ??????????? ?????????. ?????? ??????????? ????????? ?????????????? ? ??????? ??????? ?????????? ?? ?????? ????? ???????? ????? ?????? ??????? ????????...|$|E

5000|$|Company founder, John Monnett was {{approached}} by an Italian business looking for an aircraft that would meet their Microlight category. A variation of Sonerai was initially proposed to meet the 40 mph minimum flight speed requirement.

50|$|In Britain, the de Havilland Dragon was a {{successful}} aircraft during the 1930s. Its simple design used a plywood <b>box</b> <b>fuselage.</b> It could carry six passengers each with 45 lb of luggage on the London-Paris route on a fuel consumption of just 13 gal (49 l) per hour. The wing panels outboard of the engines could be folded for storage. The type was attractive as a short-haul low capacity airliner and was soon in service worldwide. British production of the DH.84 ended when it was replaced {{on the assembly line}} by the more powerful and elegant de Havilland Dragon Rapide.|$|R
50|$|The Bomber was a three-bay biplane {{of wooden}} {{structure}} with fabric covering, originally {{developed from the}} Short 184 seaplane's fuselage combined with wings developed from those on the Short Admiralty Type 166 seaplane. The <b>fuselage</b> was of <b>box</b> section with curved upper decking mounted on the lower wing. The tailplane included a split elevator with a single fin and rudder. The undercarriage consisted of a four-wheeled assembly under the nose and a skid under the tail. The crew of two sat in tandem open cockpits behind the wing; initially the observer/gunner sat in the forward cockpit {{so that he could}} stand up to operate the machine gun mounted on the upper wing. This somewhat precarious activity was rendered unnecessary by the invention of the gun ring-mount; in production aircraft the pilot occupied the forward cockpit with the gunner behind him in the rear cockpit, which was fitted with dual controls.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two kinds}} of QF-4s. The first is NULLO Full-Scale Aerial Target which keep the above basic drone conversions. For the 82d, NULLO means Not Under Live Local Operation. A NULLO flight always {{required}} at least three drones, the one to be shot down, a spare and a manned QF-4 flying as chase plane. The second kind were manned full-scale drones fitted with advanced countermeasure systems installed by the USAF. While some of the twin-stick QF-4s retained their dual control system as trainers and both ejection seats in working order, the other manned QF-4s have the rear cockpit ejection seat removed. All NULLO aircraft have both ejection seats removed. Noticeable differences between the two are the six antennas from the VDOPS scoring system, the hump on top of the <b>fuselage,</b> a crude <b>box</b> on the left intake and a fairing in the left forward Sparrow III missile well.|$|R
50|$|While the G.I {{had been}} a {{generally}} successful design it was clear it needed further improvement before it was fit for combat. The G.I was thus developed further into the G.II. The wings now only had two pairs of interplane struts {{on each side of}} the <b>fuselage</b> and the <b>box</b> shaped tail unit was replaced by a simple horizontal and vertical stabilizer assembly. Experience with the G.I had shown it to be underpowered and the G.II had more powerful six-cylinder 150 kW (200 hp) Benz Bz.IV engines installed which increased the bomb load. The increase in power also enabled the installation of a second defensive machine gun aft of the wings between the propellers which were still mounted in a pusher configuration. The crew still consisted of three men, a rear gunner, a pilot and a bomb aimer who doubled as a nose gunner.|$|R
5000|$|Following the {{commercial}} success of its single-engined de Havilland Fox Moth that had first flown in March 1932, that aircraft's original commercial operator Hillman's Airways requested that a larger twin-engined version be built. It was a simple, light design with a plywood <b>box</b> <b>fuselage</b> {{using the same}} type of engine and similar outer wing sections of the earlier single-engined aircraft. It was originally designated the DH.84 [...] "Dragon Moth" [...] but marketed as the [...] "Dragon". The prototype first flew at Stag Lane Aerodrome on 12 November 1932, it and the next four aircraft were delivered to Hillman's which started a commercial service in April 1933. It could carry six passengers, each with 45 lb (20 kg) of luggage on the London-Paris route on a fuel consumption of just 13 gal (49 l) per hour. The wing panels outboard of the engines could be folded for storage.|$|R
5000|$|The C.220 was {{powered by}} a [...] Salmson 7AC seven {{cylinder}} radial engine driving a metal, two blade propeller. One photograph shows the engine uncowled though the second aircraft, the C.221, which had a [...] Lorraine 5P five cylinder radial and was otherwise identical apart from using a different make of propeller, was recorded both with and without a narrow chord Townend ring type cowling. Behind the engine the <b>fuselage</b> was a <b>box</b> girder structure covered in plywood, though the upper decking was rounded. The forward of the two open tandem cockpits was placed between the wings at about mid-chord with the rear seat behind the trailing edge. The C.220 had a triangular fin and an unbalanced rudder with straight, parallel side and rounded top and bottom. The horizontal tail was fixed to the upper fuselage longerons. There was a fixed, tail wheel undercarriage.|$|R
40|$|PRICE 6 S 6 d NETSummary. [...] This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the formation of basic differential equations for the determination of the stress distribution in reinforced monocoque flat-sided structures, such as rectangular or polygonal <b>fuselages</b> and wing <b>boxes.</b> The general scheme of the analysis is to develop the fundamental equations which govern the stresses, strains and displacements separately in the skin-stringer combination and rib flanges. Then, by identifying displacements along their intersections, the differential equations of compatibility are formed. The solution of these equations yields the stress distribution. It is intended that further papers will be devoted to the detailed solution and application of these equations to particular problems together with experimental verification for each type of problem. A simple application of the theory is demonstrated in an appendix. A three-bay flat structure, containing a rectangular cut-out in the centre bay, under uniformly distributed tension loading is investigated. The calculated results for the longitudinal direct stress resultants in the skin-stringer combination compare favourably with those of experiment...|$|R
2500|$|The last {{attempt by}} the LPŻ ( [...] Liga Przyjaciół Żołnierza – Soldier's Friends League) {{paramilitary}} organization to design a single-seat training glider, after SZD-15 and SZD-16 designs, was the SZD-18 Czajka (peewit), which appeared in 1956. It had a simple structure, <b>box</b> <b>fuselage,</b> strutted high wing and low performance typical for the primary type of training glider. The [...] LPŻ held a competition in 1955 {{for the design of}} a new primary style single-seat trainer, which was won in March 1955 by the design by Tadeusz Grudzieński, named X-11. The prototype glider was constructed in the SZD in Bielsko by Władysław Okarmus, and designated SZD-18. Flight trials began on 30 November 1956 (pilot Adam Zientek) proving, that the SZD-18 had good handling qualities and performance adequate for its intended role. It was {{regarded as one of the}} best gliders in its class and the Polish best training glider. However, the aero clubs, now independent of the LPŻ, rejected the single-seat training concept, moving towards the more conventional two-seat pupil/instructor method, which had been proven to be quicker, more efficient and safer. No production was carried out and the sole prototype (SP-1640) flew as a club glider with the Warsaw aero club until 1966, when it was given to the Polish Aviation Museum in Kraków.|$|R
40|$|A Blended Wing Body (BWB) {{configuration}} is {{an innovative}} aircraft concept that promises high aerodynamic efficiency compared to conventional aircraft. However, unlike conventional aircraft configurations with circular fuselage cross sections, the major structural design challenge with BWB is the wide non-circular fuselage centre section, {{where it has}} to withstand both internal cabin pressures and wing bending loads. Several solutions have been proposed for the structural design of the BWB centre section, such as Top Surface Panel Plate models, Multi-Bubble model and the Y-Braced <b>Box</b> <b>Fuselage</b> to minimise the weight penalty. However, they contain {{a large number of}} separated compartments which is not particularly suitable for a cargo transport that requires a large and contiguous cargo compartment to carry bulk payload. The aim of this project is to design an efficient structural configuration for an ultra-high capacity military cargo aircraft using a BWB configuration which will be able to carry up to ten M 1 A 2 Abram battle tanks (1, 200, 000 lbs) with a range of 5, 000 NM. The Columned Multi-Bubble (CMB) is analysed and compared with the conventional Multi-Bubble and Flat shell models to verify their structural performance regarding weight and deformation. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) has been used on CAD generated models to achieve an efficient structural configuration. The paper will introduce the objective of the project and present preliminary structural analysis results...|$|R
40|$|Flying-wing {{aircraft}} {{are considered to}} have great advantages and potentials in aerodynamic performance and weight saving. However, they also have many challenges in design. One {{of the biggest challenges}} is the structural design of the inner wing (fuselage). Unlike the conventional fuselage of a tube configuration, the flying-wing aircraft inner wing cross section is limited to a noncircular shape, which is not structurally efficient to resist the internal pressure load. In order to solve this problem, a number of configurations have been proposed by other designers such as Multi Bubble Fuselage (MBF), Vaulted Ribbed Shell (VLRS), Flat Ribbed Shell (FRS), Vaulted Shell Honeycomb Core (VLHC), Flat Sandwich Shell Honeycomb Core (FLHC), Y Braced <b>Box</b> <b>Fuselage</b> and the modified fuselage designed with Y brace replaced by vaulted shell configurations. However all these configurations still inevitably have structural weight penalty compared with optimal tube fuselage layout. This current study intends to focus on finding an optimal configuration with minimum structural weight penalty for a flying-wing concept in a preliminary design stage. A new possible inner wing configuration, in terms of aerodynamic shape and structural layout, was proposed by the author, and it might be referred as ‘Wave-Section Configuration’. The methodologies of how to obtain a structurally efficient curvature of the shape, as well as how to conduct the initial sizing were incorporated. A theoretical analysis of load transmission indicated that the Wave-Section Configuration is feasible, and this was further proved as being practical by FE analysis. Moreover, initial FE analysis and comparison of the Wave-Section Configuration with two other typical configurations, Multi Bubble Fuselage and Conventional Wing, suggested that the Wave-Section Configuration is an optimal design in terms of weight saving. However, due to limitations of the author’s research area, influences on aerodynamic performances have not yet been taken into account...|$|R
