50|$|Various {{species of}} kauri give diverse resins such as <b>kauri</b> <b>copal,</b> Manilla copal and Dammar gum. The timber is {{generally}} straight-grained and of fine quality with an exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and rot resistance, making it ideal for yacht hull construction. The wood {{is commonly used}} {{in the manufacture of}} guitars and ukuleles due to its light weight and relatively low price of production. It is also used for some Go boards (goban). The uses of the New Zealand species (A. australis) included shipbuilding, house construction, wood panelling, furniture making, mine braces, and railway sleepers.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRAct Australia has {{appeared}} devoid of fossil resin occurrences except for several very small deposits in Victoria. Recently, however, pieces of amber-like fossil resin {{have been discovered}} on remote beaches near Cape Weymouth {{on the east coast}} of Cape York Peninsula in north. Queensland. They appear to derive from Quaternary deposits bordering the coast. The material ranges in colour from clear pale yellow through to dark brown and almost opaque. Numerous inclusions are present,. including fossilised insects. Tests show specimens include both copal and amber, making them of interest to gemmologists. l<iIR spectra show the fossil resins to be broadly similar to Baltic amber and <b>Kauri</b> gum (<b>copal)</b> but markedly different in their finer detail...|$|R
5000|$|Amber is fossil resin (also called resinite) from {{coniferous}} {{and other}} tree species. <b>Copal,</b> <b>kauri</b> gum, dammar and other resins {{may also be}} found as subfossil deposits. Subfossil copal can be distinguished from genuine fossil amber because it becomes tacky when a drop of a solvent such as acetone or chloroform is placed on it. [...] African <b>copal</b> and the <b>kauri</b> gum of New Zealand are also procured in a semi-fossil condition.|$|R
50|$|Resins {{that are}} used in {{varnishes}} include amber, <b>kauri</b> gum, dammar, <b>copal,</b> rosin (pine resin), sandarac, balsam, elemi, mastic, and others. Shellac is also a resin. In the 1900s in Canada, resins from local trees were used to finish pianos. As a result, these now antique pianos are considered difficult to refinish. However, shellac can be used over the existing resins provided sufficient time is allowed for thin coats to cure. Thus the original finish can be returned to its original lustre while preserving the color and age-related crackle.|$|R
