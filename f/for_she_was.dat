25|$|At {{one point}} in 1988, the Dial-A-Song {{answering}} machine recorded a conversation between two people who had listened to Dial-A-Song, then questioned how they made money out of it. An excerpt from the conversation has been included as a hidden track on the EP <b>for</b> (<b>She</b> <b>Was</b> A) Hotel Detective.|$|E
25|$|Abraham {{instructed}} his wife, Sarah, {{to mislead}} the Egyptians {{and say that}} she is his sister (Gen. 12:10). Abraham's story was strictly true– Sarah was his half sister– but intentionally misleading because {{it was designed to}} lead the Egyptians to believe that Sarah was not Abraham's wife for Abraham feared that they would kill him in order to take her, <b>for</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> very beautiful.|$|E
25|$|The Jesuits {{had many}} who opposed them. The Jansenists were {{numerous}} among {{the enemies of}} the orthodox party. The Sorbonne joined the Gallicans, the Philosophes, and the Encyclopédistes. Louis XV was weak; {{his wife and children}} were in favor of the Jesuits; his able first minister, the Duc de Choiseul, played {{into the hands of the}} Parlement, and the royal mistress, Madame de Pompadour, to whom the Jesuits had refused absolution <b>for</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> living in sin with the King of France, was a determined opponent. The determination of the Parlement of Paris in time bore down all opposition.|$|E

25|$|On Jefferson's {{isolated}} mountaintop, sex {{took place}} {{as part of}} a hierarchy that everyone involved understood. Jefferson, and those of his class, did not share our current understanding of sexual morality. Sally Hemings was his servant, and had little power. She was dependent economically, though this does not mean her feelings were irrelevant. But it does mean that he had extraordinary power, and she very little, and so, as his concubine, she had probably replicated her mother's relationship with Jefferson's father-in-law; <b>for</b> <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> in fact, Jefferson's late wife's half-sister, and I have described the Hemings family as a parallel, subordinate family to the all-white Jeffersons.|$|E
25|$|Seamen of the {{battleship}} Bismarck! You have covered yourself with glory! The {{sinking of the}} battle cruiser Hood has not only military, but psychological value, <b>for</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> the pride of Great Britain. Henceforth the enemy will try to concentrate his forces and bring them into action against us. I therefore released Prinz Eugen at noon yesterday {{so that she could}} conduct commerce warfare on her own. She has managed to evade the enemy. We, on the other hand, because of the hits we have received, have been ordered to proceed to a French port. On our way there the enemy will gather and give us battle. The German people are with you, and we will fight until our gun barrels glow red-hot and the last shell has left the barrels. For us, seamen, the question is victory or death.|$|E
500|$|Cresswell was not {{buried at}} Knockholt and was {{possibly}} interred in the Bridewell graveyard. Several accounts claim {{that in her}} will she left £10 for a sermon to be read that said nothing ill of her. After a long search, a young clergyman prepared to perform the funeral rites was found. Following a lengthy sermon on social morality, he intoned: [...] "By {{the will of the}} deceased it is expected that I should mention her and say nothing but what was well of her. All I shall say of her, therefore, is this– she was born well, lived well, and died well; <b>for</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> born with the name of Cresswell, lived at Clerkenwell, and died in Bridewell." ...|$|E

500|$|Several {{accounts}} of the sinking have been preserved that describe the incident, but the only confirmed eyewitness account is the testimony of a surviving Flemish crewman written down by the Holy Roman Emperor's ambassador François van der Delft in a letter dated [...] According to the unnamed Fleming, the ship had fired all of its guns of one side and was turning to present the guns {{on the other side}} to the enemy ship, when she was caught in a strong gust of wind, heeled and took in water through the open gunports. In a letter to William Paget dated , former Lord High Admiral John Russel claimed that the ship had been lost because of [...] "rechenes and great negligence". Three years after the sinking, the Hall's Chronicle gave the reason for the sinking as being caused by [...] "to much foly... <b>for</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> laden with much ordinaunce, and the portes left open, which were low, & the great ordinaunce unbreached, so that when the ship should turne, the water entered, and sodainly she sanke." ...|$|E

2500|$|Beyoncé penned a {{personal}} note: [...] "Donna Summer made music that moved me both emotionally and physically {{to get up}} and dance. You could always hear the deep passion in her voice.

2500|$|... "As {{early as}} 1945 Paul Stern pointed out Fritzi Gordon to me, saying 'There is the partner for you.' I was not enthusiastic. For one thing, I {{already had a}} more than {{satisfactory}} partner in Doris Rhodes, a good friend, and for another I suspected that Mrs. Gordon and I would not hit it off socially, whatever we did at the table. My opinion did not change when she played at the Hamilton Club and I got to know her better. [...] as far as bridge is concerned, I have not a word of complaint about Fritzi Gordon, <b>for</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a wonderful player and an excellent partner, who contributed greatly to my own success." ...|$|E
2500|$|Marcella {{belonged to}} the {{generation}} whose childhood was marred by {{the violence of the}} civil wars of the Roman Republic. Her first marriage took place to Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa in 28 BC. [...] She was his second wife. Augustus held Agrippa in the highest place of honor. Agrippa was a military man loyal to Octavian throughout the civil war. The marriage of Marcella and Agrippa probably occurred because of the strong bond between the two men. Marcella brought Agrippa a tie to an elite republican family and to Augustus himself, <b>for</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> Augustus's niece. Although Agrippa was older than Marcella but austere, he appeared to be a good husband to Marcella.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1916, Thomas met actor Jack Pickford, {{brother of}} one of the most {{successful}} silent stars, Mary Pickford, at a beach cafe on the Santa Monica Pier. Both Thomas and Pickford were known for their partying. Screenwriter Frances Marion remarked, [...] "I had seen her often at the Pickford home, <b>for</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> engaged to Mary's brother, Jack. Two innocent-looking children, they were the gayest, wildest brats who ever stirred the stardust on Broadway. Both were talented, but they were much more interested in playing the roulette of life than in concentrating on their careers." [...] Thomas eloped with Pickford on October 25, 1916, in New Jersey. None of their family was present, with only actor Thomas Meighan as their witness. The couple never had children of their own. In 1920, they adopted Thomas' six-year-old nephew when his mother died.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the reading}} {{continues}} in chapter [...] Abraham settled between Kadesh and Shur. While he was sojourning in Gerar, Abraham said that Sarah was his sister, so King Abimelech had her brought to him, but God came to Abimelech {{in a dream}} {{and told him that}} taking her would cause him to die, <b>for</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a married woman. Abimelech had not approached her, so he asked God whether God would slay an innocent, as Abraham and Sarah had told him that they were brother and sister. God told Abimelech in the dream that God knew that Abimelech had a blameless heart, and so God had kept him from touching her. God told Abimelech to restore Abraham's wife, since he was a prophet, and he would intercede for Abimelech to save his life, which he and his household would lose if he failed to restore her. Early next morning, Abimelech told his servants what had happened, asked Abraham what he had done and why he had brought so great a guilt upon Abimelech and his kingdom. Abraham replied that he had thought that Gerar had no fear of God and would kill him because of his wife, and that she was in fact his father's daughter though not his mother's, so he had asked of her the kindness of identifying him as her brother. Abimelech restored Sarah to Abraham, gave him sheep, oxen, and slaves, and invited him to settle wherever he pleased in Abimelech's lands. And Abimelech told Sarah that he was giving Abraham a thousand pieces of silver to serve her as vindication before all. Abraham then prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and the women in his household, so that they bore children, for God had stricken the women with infertility because of Sarah.
