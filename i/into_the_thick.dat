5|$|In February 1945, as the Australians began {{advancing}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick,</b> hilly interior, {{the utility}} of the machine guns decreased. At the behest of Brigadier Roy King, commander of the 16th Brigade, the 2/3rd Machine Gun Battalion was hastily converted into a standard infantry battalion, which was achieved with a quick issue of rifles, sub-machine guns and mortars. From then {{until the end of the}} war, the battalion took part in the ground advance through Wewak and beyond, fighting a series of small scale patrol actions, initially advancing through Arohemi and Muguluwela, and finally the town of But, while 'B' Company was assigned to Farida Force and carried out an amphibious landing around Dove Bay, in early May. The battalion later moved into the Mandi and Brandi areas where they were tasked with re-invigorating the Australian operations in the area, as Japanese resistance around the plantations increased. By late July, the majority of the battalion moved to Wewak Point, while two companies remained in the vicinity of Mandi–Bandi; operations in the area had killed 59 Japanese, for the loss of four men from 2/3rd killed in action and eight wounded. The battalion's final action of the war came on 7 August when a patrol killed four Japanese. A week later, the Japanese surrender was announced, bringing combat operations officially to an end. The battalion's final campaign of the war cost them 94 battle casualties.|$|E

Cut off from support he fought fiercely, but his ship was overwhelmed and captured, with Berkeley being killed in the action. His body {{was taken to the}} Netherlands and embalmed, before being returned to England and interred in Westminster Abbey. Accusations of cowardice pursued him even after his death, but later biographies have been more sympathetic.|$|E

25|$|These {{mangroves}} {{are important}} nursery grounds {{for nearly all}} major angling fish including yellowfin bream (Acanthopagrus australis), flat-tail sea-mullet (Liza argentea), luderick (Girella tricuspidata) and sand whiting (Sillago ciliata) which are caught in adjoining waters as adults, mangroves also provide rich organic matter to the Port Hacking Estuary by fixing carbon into the river system through the addition of leaves <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> rich black mud. Many crustacean and mollusc species rely on mangroves {{as a source of}} food whether by providing foraging through leaf litter, mud or direct predation of the mangrove trees and seeds. Soldier crabs (Mictyris longicarpus), semaphore crab (Heloecius cordiformis), blue swimmer crabs (Portunus pelagicus) and hermit crabs (Pagurus sinuatus) also call the mangroves home. A more casual visitor to the mangroves at high tide is the eastern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus australis) which scoots around just an inch from the surface and is virtually invisible unless viewed through a snorkel.|$|E
25|$|Other castles {{begun in}} the 11th century were built on {{elevated}} sites that {{took advantage of the}} steep slopes for defense, rather than on moats. The central tower became the final defensive layer of the castle, while the main domestic quarters were built against the walls around the perimeter, allowing plenty of room for a variety of functions. Conisborough Castle is an English example, with the shell keep rising on the earlier motte, and a wall with the residential and service quarters built into it, enclosing the bailey. The ruins within the bailey show remains of a great hall with central fireplace, a kitchen and a two storeyed residential block with adjacent latrines. The keep itself contains a room for the lord, complete with a hooded fireplace, while a small vaulted chapel was built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> outer wall of the keep. Ludlow Castle, Shropshire {{begun in the}} 11th century, was lived in by a number of members of the Tudor royal family and had both its fortifications and living quarters improved over several centuries.|$|E
25|$|At dawn on June 11, Hampton {{devised a}} plan {{in which he would}} split his {{divisions}} across the two roads leading to Clayton's Store and converge on the enemy at that crossroads, pushing Sheridan back to the North Anna River. Hampton took two of his brigades with him from Trevilian with his third remaining on his left to prevent flanking. The other division, under Fitzhugh Lee, was ordered to advance from Louisa Court House, making up the right flank. While the Confederates began their advance, Sheridan started his. Two brigades of Brig. Gen. Alfred T. A. Torbert's division moved down the road to Trevilian Station while a third advanced toward Louisa Court House. The first contact occurred on the Trevilian Road as the South Carolinians of Brig. Gen. Matthew C. Butler's brigade clashed with Brig. Gen. Wesley Merritt's skirmish line. Hampton dismounted his men and pushed the skirmishers back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> woods, expecting Fitzhugh Lee to arrive on his right at any minute. However, Hampton was severely outnumbered and soon he was forced back. Eventually Col. Gilbert J. Wright's Confederate brigade joined in the close-quarter fighting in the thick brush, but after several hours they also were pushed back within sight of Trevilian Station.|$|E

25|$|BMF and the Penan tribe {{tried to}} search for Manser without any success. Areas around the Limbang river were searched by the Penan people. Penan {{expedition}} teams tracked Manser to his last sleeping place. They followed Manser's machete cuts <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> forests until the trail reached the swamp {{at the foot of}} Bukit Batu Lawi. There was no trace of him in the swamp, going back from the swamp, or trace of anyone else coming into the area. BMF sent a helicopter to circle the limestone pinnacles. However, none of the search teams were willing to scale the last 100 metres of steep limestone that formed the peak of Batu Lawi. It is possible that Manser fell {{down the side of the}} mountain but neither his body nor his belongings have been found. However, two local guides who brought Manser across the jungles of Sarawak were found. In desperation, fortune tellers and Penan necromancers were called. All of them agreed Bruno Manser was still alive. On 18 November 2000, BMF requested that the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) search for Bruno Manser. Investigations were carried out at the Swiss Consulate in Kuala Lumpur and the Swiss Honoarary Consulate in Kuching.|$|E

Although Harvey was a significant naval figure for over twenty years, his martial reputation was largely based on his experiences at the Battle of Trafalgar, when he took his ship HMS Temeraire <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> of the action.

500|$|In February 1941, the 9th Division was {{completely}} reorganised, with its 18th and 25th Infantry Brigades {{transferred to the}} 7th Division. In return, it received the 20th and 24th Infantry Brigades, the latter short one battalion which was on garrison duty in Darwin. The 9th Division, less its partly trained and equipped artillery, was ordered {{to move to the}} Tobruk–Derna area where it would relieve the 6th Division, so that formation could participate in the Battle of Greece. The half-trained and half-equipped 9th Division was pitched <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> of the action almost immediately, steadying the retreat of Commonwealth forces from the newly arrived German Afrika Korps, under General Erwin Rommel, and occupying the vital port of Tobruk. Morshead was given command of the Tobruk garrison which, as the retreat (known to the Australians as the [...] "Benghazi handicap") continued, became surrounded, hundreds of miles behind enemy lines. Lieutenant General John Lavarack determined that Tobruk could be held and ordered Morshead to defend it. He also ordered the 18th Infantry Brigade to reinforce the garrison, bringing it up to four brigades, with British artillery and tank units brought up to provide support.|$|E

2500|$|Beatrice Sherman, The New York Times Book Review (February 27, 1949) — [...] "A Nero Wolfe Threesome" [...] is the {{subtitle}} for {{this collection of}} mysteries. The opening situation in each story {{is that of a}} man who feels sure {{he is going to be}} killed and wants to pay Wolfe handsomely to stave off the evil day — permanently, if possible. Wolfe refuses to set his nimble brain, his bulky body or his trusted aide, Archie, working on such cases. The odds against a determined murderer are too long. Mr. Wolfe would rather devote himself to his orchids. As it turns out, Wolfe and Archie are drawn <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> of all three cases, and solve them by playing their usual fast-and-loose game of cooperation with the police.
