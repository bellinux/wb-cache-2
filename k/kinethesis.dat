40|$|This study was, {{designed}} ' {{to investigate}} a specific skill pattern {{as it relates to}} kinesthetics and hand dominance. The specific skill pattern investigated was the ability of subjects, using either their dominant or nondominant hand, to catch a ball when they were unable to see their arm or hand. An "L " shaped curtain containiqg a tole for the"ball to pass through was used for this study. Tte side of the curtain contained an arm sleeve which allowed the subject to see the ball in its parabolic flight pattern but did not allow the subject to see either her arm or hand. One hundred sixty high school girls were randomly chosen. and assigned to one of the following four experimental treatment variables: (1) dominant hand}anesthetic catching ability, (2) dominant hand visual catching. ability, (3) nondominant hand kinesthetic catching ability, and (4) nondominant hand visual catching ability. It was found that {{there was a significant difference}} betweeg) vision and <b>kinethesis</b> in the ball catching task. A significant difference was also fotind between dominant and nondominant hands in the catching task. No significant difference was revealed between dominant and nondominant hand catching ability in the visual catching task. (Author...|$|E
40|$|Behavioral {{theory in}} {{geography}} attempts {{to describe and}} explain the spatial activities of individuals in terms of fundamental perceptual and cognitive processes. As applied to surfing, behavioral theory can give us greater insight into localism (territoriality) and provides a context for understanding the complex cognitive processes involved in choosing where to surf and in choosing where to paddle out at a particular surf break. The major emphasis throughout this section will be on localism. Although the intent is to set the behavioral theories {{in the context of}} surfing, it will also be necessary to consider other theory bases such as ecological models, economic models, and ethical models. SPATIAL BEHAVIOR, PERCEPTION, AND COGNITION The objective of Behavioral Geography (or Environmental Psychology) is to develop descriptive and explanatory theories of an individualâ€™s behavior in a spatial setting. Two basic concepts from psychology are needed to build a behavioral theory: perception and cognition. Perception describes the way in which an individual acquires knowledge about themself and the world through their senses. The senses include vision, hearing, smelling, tasting, pressure, texture, temperature, <b>kinethesis</b> (limb position and movement), and vestibular senses (gravity and body acceleration). Cognition describes higher order processes that are used to interpretate the sensed world and form a basis for action. These higher orde...|$|E
