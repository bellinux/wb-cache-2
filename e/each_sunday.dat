5|$|From 7 June 1991, Masses were celebrated <b>each</b> <b>Sunday</b> in the churchyard—the {{institute}} still {{occupied the}} building.

Religious education had been given regularly {{under the direction of the}} Salesian Sisters since 29November 1991. At the same time, the first charities were founded for nursing and aid to the poor. The vice-mayor of Moscow, Yury Luzhkov, signed a decree in favour of the Church on 1 February 1992 ordering the institute to vacate the property by 1994. Parish members entered the building on 2July 1992, and occupied the institute's workshop. Moscow City Council agreed to allow the church to occupy the space, which was subsequently walled off from the remainder of the building. There, in the former workshop, Mass was celebrated regularly.|$|E

5|$|The 16 sailors on Tahiti {{began to}} organise their lives. One group, led by Morrison and Tom McIntosh, began {{building}} a schooner, which they named Resolution after Cook's ship. Morrison {{had not been}} an active mutineer; rather than waiting for recapture, he hoped to sail the vessel to the Dutch East Indies and surrender to the authorities there, hoping that such action would confirm his innocence. Morrison's group maintained ship's routine and discipline, even {{to the extent of}} holding divine service <b>each</b> <b>Sunday.</b> Churchill and Matthew Thompson, on the other hand, chose to lead drunken and generally dissolute lives, which ended in the violent deaths of both. Churchill was murdered by Thompson, who was in turn killed by Churchill's native friends. Others, such as Stewart and Heywood, settled into quiet domesticity; Heywood spent much of his time studying the Tahitian language. He adopted native dress and, in accordance with the local custom, was heavily tattooed on his body.|$|E
5|$|The UK Singles Chart is the {{official}} record chart in the United Kingdom. Until 1983, it was compiled weekly by the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) {{on behalf of the}} British record industry with a two-week break each Christmas. The BMRB used motorcycle couriers to collect the sales figures taken up to the close of trade on Saturday. This data was compiled on Monday and given to the BBC on Tuesday to be announced on Johnnie Walker's afternoon show and later published in Music Week. On 4 January 1983, the chart was taken over by Gallup who expanded the chart from the Top 75 to the Top 100 and began the introduction of computerised tills which automated the data collection process. The chart was based entirely on sales of physical singles from retail outlets and announced on Tuesday until October 1987, when the Top 40 was revealed <b>each</b> <b>Sunday,</b> due to the new automated process.|$|E

5|$|When {{the show}} began in 1985, {{the first season}} was {{broadcast}} on the Seven Network, at 5:30pm in Sydney, at 6:00pm in Melbourne and Adelaide and at 7:00pm in Brisbane. The show's transmission in other areas was varied and many regional channels declined to purchase the series. When the show debuted on Network Ten in 1986 it screened at 7:00pm. In 1992 the show moved to 6:30pm to avoid direct competition from rival soap opera Home and Away on the Seven Network. Repeat episodes of Neighbours episodes from the 1988–1991 period were broadcast between 2000 and June 2003 on Network Ten. These episodes were seen at 3:30pm, before moving to 11:30am.
