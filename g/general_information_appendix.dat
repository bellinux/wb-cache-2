40|$|M. Tech. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (hereinafter {{referred}} to as “PTSD”) is the diagnosis encompassing a cluster of distressing symptoms which is characterized by re-experiencing trauma, by avoidance behaviour and by hyper-arousal, symptoms which persist {{for more than a}} month after a traumatic event and may worsen over time (Follette and Pistorello, 2007). Where traumatic violence presents women easily develop chronic PTSD. The lifetime prevalence, risk, tendency and persistence to suffer from the disease symptoms of PTSD, is significantly higher in women compared with men. Women also experience a longer course of illness and worse quality-of-life outcomes (Seedat S., Stein D. J. and Carey P. D., 2005). Conventional treatment methods using antidepressants and mood-enhancers, are plagued by numerous, documented side effects, such as cardiovascular complications, liver impairment, neuropsychological changes, suicidal tendencies and aggression (Pacher and Kecskemeti, 2004, Gibbons R. D., Brown C. H., Hur, K., Marcus S. M., Bhaumik D. K., J. A., Herings R. M. C. and Mann J. J. (2007). The homoeopathic complex t. r. s 200 C® by Pegasus Homeopathic is a commercial product which is indicated for the treatment of shock and trauma, but there has so far been no other research in respect of its effectiveness in the treatment of PTSD. The aim of this research was to determine the efficacy of the homeopathic complex Pegasus t. r. s 200 C® on the symptoms of PTSD in women. Symptoms were assessed by means of a modified DSM-IV criterion. Thirty females aged eighteen-fifty-five were recruited by means of an advertisement placed at The Nisaa Institute for Women’s Development (hereinafter {{referred to}} as “Nisaa”) (Appendix A). All the participants were pre-diagnosed with PTSD lasting not longer than two years, under supervision of a registered psychologist from the institution. Participants on chronic medication, except for hypertensive medication, on contraceptives, as well as pregnant or lactating women, were excluded from the study. This research was done as a pre-test post-test non-equivalent group design with a double-blind placebo-control (Robson, 1993; Trochim, 2006). Those who met the criteria were supplied with a <b>general</b> <b>information</b> form (<b>Appendix</b> B), and were asked to sign a consent form (Appendix C).
