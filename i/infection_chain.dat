40|$|A {{major risk}} factor in the spread of {{diseases}} between holdings is the transport of live animals. This study analysed the animal movements of the pork supply chain of a producer group in Northern Germany. The parameters in-degree and out-degree, ingoing and outgoing <b>infection</b> <b>chain,</b> betweenness and ingoing and outgoing closeness were measured using dynamic network analysis to identify holdings with central positions in the network and to characterize the overall network topology. The potential maximum epidemic size was also estimated. All parameters were calculated for three time periods: the 3 -yearly network, the yearly and the monthly networks. The yearly and the monthly networks were more fragmented than the 3 -yearly network. On average, one-third of the holdings were isolated in the yearly networks and almost three quarters in the monthly networks. This represented an immense {{reduction in the number}} of holdings participating in the trade of the monthly networks. The overall network topology showed right-skewed distributions for all calculated centrality parameters indicating that network resilience was high concerning the random removal of holdings. However, for a targeted removal of holdings according to their centrality, a rapid fragmentation of the trade network could be expected. Furthermore, to capture the real importance of holdings for disease transmission, indirect trade contacts (<b>infection</b> <b>chain)</b> should be considered. In contrast to the parameters regarding direct trade contacts (degree), the <b>infection</b> <b>chain</b> parameter did not underestimate the potential risk of disease transmission. This became more obvious, the longer the observed time period was. For all three time periods, the results for the estimation of the potential maximum epidemic size illustrated that the outgoing <b>infection</b> <b>chain</b> should be chosen. It considers the chronological order and the directed nature of the contacts and has no restrictions such as the strongly connected components of a cyclic network...|$|E

40|$|Centrality {{parameters}} {{in animal}} trade networks typically have right-skewed distributions, implying that these networks are highly resistant against the random removal of holdings, but {{vulnerable to the}} targeted removal of the most central holdings. In the present study, we analysed the structural changes of an animal trade network topology based on the targeted removal of holdings using specific centrality parameters {{in comparison to the}} random removal of holdings. Three different time periods were analysed: the three-year network, the yearly and the monthly networks. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify appropriate measures for the targeted removal, which lead to a rapid fragmentation of the network. Furthermore, the optimal combination of the removal of three holdings regardless of their centrality was identified. The results showed that centrality parameters based on ingoing trade contacts, e. g. in-degree, ingoing <b>infection</b> <b>chain</b> and ingoing closeness, were not suitable for a rapid fragmentation in all three time periods. More efficient was the removal based on parameters considering the outgoing trade contacts. In all networks, a maximum percentage of 7. 0 % (on average 5. 2 %) of the holdings had to be removed to reduce the size of the largest component by more than 75 %. The smallest difference from the optimal combination for all three time periods was obtained by the removal based on out-degree with on average 1. 4 % removed holdings, followed by outgoing <b>infection</b> <b>chain</b> and outgoing closeness. The targeted removal using the betweenness centrality differed the most from the optimal combination in comparison to the other parameter...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to design a {{transmission}} experiment that enabled quantification of the effectiveness of vaccination against foot and mouth disease (FMD) virus in groups of pigs. Previous experiments showed that intradermal injection of pigs with FMD virus 14 days after vaccination was not suitable to start an <b>infection</b> <b>chain,</b> as inoculated vaccinated pigs resisted challenge. Therefore, we carried out two experiments in which we used direct contact to a non-vaccinated pig as route of infection. In the first experiment only the vaccine effect on susceptibility was quantified by exposing pigs, either vaccinated 14 days before or not vaccinated, each to a non-vaccinated seeder pig inoculated with FMD virus O/NET/ 2001. Since no significant differences were observed between contact infections in vaccinated or non-vaccinated pigs, we performed a second experiment in which both susceptibility and infectivity were subject to vaccination. We quantified virus transmission in homogenous groups of vaccinated or non-vaccinated pigs in which the <b>infection</b> <b>chain</b> was started by exposure to a third group of non-vaccinated infected pigs. Transmission occurred to all contact-exposed pigs in the non-vaccinated groups and to 9 out of 10 contact-exposed pigs in the vaccinated groups. The rate of transmission (ß) was significantly reduced in the vaccine group. Yet, the estimated reproduction ratio in both groups was still above 1. In conclusion, by adjusting our transmission study design and challenge method, we were able to quantify transmission of FMDV among vaccinated pigs. According to this study a single vaccination was not sufficient to stop pig to pig virus transmission. With these results major outbreaks may still be expected, even in groups of vaccinated pigs...|$|E

Primary oosporic inoculum {{plays a key role}} in epidemic development, and some of these models have been elaborated following an empirical approach to define quantitative relationships between occurrences of primary infections and weather factors influencing them. Recently, a mechanistic dynamic model was elaborated which accounts for the biological effects of weather on the different stages of the primary <b>infection</b> <b>chain,</b> from the progressive breaking of dormancy in the overwintering oospore population to infection establishment. In this work, three widely used models (3 - 10 rule, EPI and DMCast) were compared with this model (named UCSC model) on the basis of their theoretical approaches and their accuracy was tested against real data collected over a 9 -year period in Sardinia (Italy). The two empirical models, 3 - 10 and EPI, seem to be too over-simplified to simulate correctly a complex biological phenomenon such as the sexual stage of P. viticola they lack consideration of some key stages of the <b>infection</b> <b>chain</b> and simultaneously simulate various biological events, each of which are influenced by specific weather conditions. EPI, in particular, needs specific calibrations and ongoing processes of adaptation that make its use in disease warning difficult. DMCast overcomes these problems because of its mechanistic approach; nevertheless, the empirical method used to model oospore maturation requires validations and, as in the present case, modifications before practical use. The UCSC model, due to its fully mechanistic approach, does not present this problem and provides accurate dynamic simulations of the sexual stage of P. viticola, with a high degree of detail and requiring neither calibrations nor corrections...|$|E

The present study analysed the pork supply chain of a producer community in Northern Germany. The structure of trade networks can be characterised by carrying out a network analysis. To identify holdings with a central position in this directed network of pig production, several parameters describing these properties were measured (in-degree, out-degree, ingoing and outgoing <b>infection</b> <b>chain,</b> betweenness centrality and ingoing and outgoing closeness centrality). To obtain {{the importance of the}} different holding types (multiplier, farrowing farms, finishing farms and farrow-to-finishing farms) within the pyramidal structure of the pork supply chain, centrality parameters were calculated for the entire network {{as well as for the}} individual holding types. Using these centrality parameters, two types of holdings could be identified. In the network studied, finishing and farrow-to-finishing farms were more likely to be infected due to the high number of ingoing trade contacts. Due to the high number of outgoing trade contacts multipliers and farrowing farms had an increased risk to spread a disease to other holdings. However, the results of the centrality parameters degree and <b>infection</b> <b>chain</b> were not always consistent, such that the indirect trade contacts should be taken into consideration to understand the real importance of a holding in spreading or contracting an infection. Furthermore, all calculated parameters showed a highly right-skewed distribution. Networks with such a degree distribution are considered to be highly resistant concerning the random removal of nodes. But by strategic removal of the most central holdings, e. g. by trade restrictions or selective vaccination or culling, the network structure can be changed efficiently and thus decompose into fragments. Such a fragmentation of the trade networks is of particular importance from an epidemiological perspective...|$|E

Animals previously infected with LPAI virus, on the other hand, survive an infection with HPAI virus or escape infection all together. This implies that a previous infection with LPAI virus effectively reduces susceptibility of the host to infection and decreases transmission of HPAI virus.

MethodsOne hundred Enteritidis isolates dating from 1989 to 1994 which could be allocated epidemiologically to different sources or to small community outbreaks were investigated with ribotyping, a fingerprinting method in which bacterial DNA is hybridized with the biotin-labeled plasmid pKK 3535 containing a ribosomal RNA operon of Escherichia coli to determine the ribosomal RNA gene restriction patterns. ResultsFour different ribotyping patterns were found with the restriction endonuclease SmaI and nine with SphI. Ribotypes of isolates which could be allocated epidemiologically to a common source usually corresponded. Almost 60 % of the Enteritidis infections had the ribotyping pattern SphI-A. In contrast, this pattern was not found {{in any of the}} five Enteritidis strains isolated in 1989.

ConclusionsAs patterns SphI-A and SmaI-J appeared in 58 % and 75 % of the isolates, respectively, ribotyping cannot be used for the differentiation between various outbreaks with these two patterns.

We hypothesized that this increase could be explained by the marked influx of asylum seekers in this time period. We analysed national surveillance data and estimated the number of imported and autochthonous hepatitis A cases in asylum seekers. We also investigated molecular signatures of hepatitis A viruses sampled from asylum seekers to identify chains of transmission. We found that 40 % (278 cases) of all 699 hepatitis A cases notified between September 2015 and March 2016 in Germany concerned asylum seekers. Most infections were acquired abroad, but at least 24 % accounted for autochthonous infections.

(2013, 2015), where the centrality parameters also depend on the considered farm type. Especially the farm types {{at the beginning of the}} pork supply chain, i.e. multipliers and farrowing farms had significant higher values for the centrality parameters regarding the outgoing trade contacts compared to the farm types at the end of the pork supply chain, i.e. finishing and farrow-to-finishing farms. Furthermore, these studies showed that the rankings of the centrality parameters based on outgoing edges (e.g. out-degree, outgoing <b>infection</b> <b>chain)</b> had a more stable ranking than the centrality parameters based on the ingoing trade contacts (e.g. in-degree, ingoing <b>infection</b> <b>chain).</b> These findings gave evidence to the fact that there were some highly central farms delivering animals to the majority of this network. This results in a high value for the centrality parameters based on the outgoing trade contacts. However, it has to be considered that the values of the centrality parameters cannot directly be compared to the results of the temporal correlation coefficient. The reason for this is the fact that during the calculation of the centrality parameters only one node is focussed including the attached edges but it is unimportant which node stands on the other side of this edge. In contrast to this, during the calculation of the temporal correlation coefficient these pairs of nodes and especially the connection between two specific nodes are considered. Thus, an additional statement on stability of the connections between the nodes is made. This has to be kept in mind when talking about temporal correlation coefficients. Despite the differences between the calculation of centrality parameters and the temporal correlation coefficient both can pass on more information if the direction of the edges is considered. The direction of the movements is of special importance for the analysis of disease spread within such directed networks. Here, a high number of ingoing movements increases the probability to get an infection, whereas a high number of outgoing movements means that the probability for spreading an infection increases. For the investigation of aggregated networks it is therefore very important to check the quality of this aggregation, in terms of high values for the temporal correlation coefficient. Furthermore, in order to keep the information of the directed network it is important to calculate not only the undirected temporal correlation coefficient C [...]...|$|E

Previous analyses of experimental data from FMD outbreaks in non-homogeneously mixing populations of sheep have suggested a decline in viraemic level through serial passage of the virus, but these do not take into account possible variation in the length of the chain of viral transmission for each animal, which is implicit in the non-observed transmission process. We consider a susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed non-Markovian compartmental model for partially observed epidemic processes, and we employ powerful methodology (Markov chain Monte Carlo) for statistical inference, to address epidemiological issues under a Bayesian framework that accounts for all available information and associated uncertainty in a coherent approach. The analysis allows us to {{investigate the}} posterior distribution of the hidden transmission history of the epidemic, and thus to determine the effect of the length of the <b>infection</b> <b>chain</b> on the recorded viraemic levels, based on the posterior distribution of a p-value.

Phylogenetic analysis of ɛ determinant sequences demonstrated sufficient genetic divergence for molecular classification, with the exception of HAdV- 15 and HAdV- 29, which also cannot be differentiated by classical cross-neutralization. Precise sequence divergence criteria for typing (< 2. 5 % from loop 2 prototype sequence and < 2. 4 % from loop 1 sequence) were deduced from phylogenetic analysis. These criteria may also facilitate identification of new HAdV prototypes. Fiber knob (γ determinant) phylogeny indicated a two-step model of species evolution and multiple intraspecies recombination events in the origin of HAdV prototypes. HAdV- 29 was identified as a recombination variant of HAdV- 15 (ɛ determinant) and a speculative, not-yet-isolated HAdV prototype (γ determinant). Subanalysis of molecular evolution in hypervariable regions 1 to 6 of the ɛ determinant indicated different selective pressures in subclusters of species HAdV-D. Additionally, γ determinant phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that HAdV- 8 did not cluster with - 19 and - 37 in spite of their having the same tissue tropism. The phylogeny of HAdV-E 4 suggested origination by interspecies recombination between HAdV-B (hexon) and HAdV-C (fiber), as in simian adenovirus 25, indicating additional zoonotic transfer.

The network demonstrated scale-free and small-world topologies as observed in other livestock shipment studies. This heterogeneity in contacts among farm types and network topologies should be incorporated in simulation models to improve their validity. In conclusion, this study provided useful epidemiological information and parameters for the control and modelling of disease spread among swine farms, for the first time from Ontario, Canada...|$|R
40|$|Today, malware authors {{not only}} write {{malicious}} software but also employ obfuscation, polymorphism, packing and endless such evasive techniques to escape detection by Anti-Virus Products (AVP). Besides the individual behavior of malware, the relations that exist among them {{play an important}} role for improving malware detection. This work aims to enable malware analysts at F-Secure Labs to explore various such relationships between malicious URLs and file samples in addition to their individual behavior and activity. The current detection methods at F-Secure Labs analyze unknown URLs and file samples independently without taking into account the correlations that might exist between them. Such traditional classification methods perform well but are not efficient at identifying complex multi-stage malware that hide their activity. The interactions between malware may include any type of network activity, dropping, downloading, etc. For instance, an unknown downloader that connects to a malicious website which in turn drops a malicious payload, should indeed be blacklisted. Such analysis can help block the malware infection at its source and also comprehend the whole <b>infection</b> <b>chain.</b> The outcome of this proof-of-concept study is a system that detects new malware using graph modeling to infer their relationship to known malware as part of the malware classification services at F-Secure...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{outbreaks}} of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses in poultry and their threatening zoonotic consequences emphasize {{the need for}} effective control measures. Although vaccination of poultry against avian influenza provides a potentially attractive control measure, {{little is known about}} the effect of vaccination on epidemiologically relevant parameters, such as transmissibility and the infectious period. We used transmission experiments to study the effect of vaccination on the transmission characteristics of HPAI A/Chicken/Netherlands/ 03 H 7 N 7 in chickens. In the experiments, a number of infected and uninfected chickens is housed together and the <b>infection</b> <b>chain</b> is monitored by virus isolation and serology. Analysis is based on a stochastic susceptible, latently infected, infectious, recovered (SEIR) epidemic model. We found that vaccination is able to reduce the transmission level to such an extent that a major outbreak is prevented, important variables being the type of vaccine (H 7 N 1 or H 7 N 3) and the moment of challenge after vaccination. Two weeks after vaccination, both vaccines completely block transmission. One week after vaccination, the H 7 N 1 vaccine is better than the H 7 N 3 vaccine at reducing the spread of the H 7 N 7 virus. We discuss the implications of these findings for the use of vaccination programs in poultry and the value of transmission experiments in the process of choosing vaccine...|$|E
40|$|SummaryToxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is a {{protozoan}} parasite {{that can}} cause toxoplasmosis in humans. However, there is no current data regarding Toxoplasma infection among individuals who were referred to medical laboratories in Mazandaran province (northern Iran). Therefore, we performed a population-based study of Toxoplasma seroprevalence in this region. A total of 1832 sera samples (from 654 men and 1178 women) were collected from people who were referred to medical laboratories in different cities throughout Mazandaran province between March and July 2012. The serum titers of anti-T. gondii IgG and IgM were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The seroprevalence of anti-Toxoplasma IgG was 55. 5 %; and 14. 4 % of the positive samples were seropositive for anti-Toxoplasma IgM. The highest seroprevalence was observed among people who were > 50 years old (90. 6 %), and the lowest seroprevalence was observed among children who were 0 – 9 years old (9. 4 %; P< 0. 001). There {{was no significant difference}} in the seroprevalences for each sex in the study population. However, a regional sex-specific difference in seroprevalence was observed between men (54. 1 %) and women (70. 6 %; P= 0. 003) in the western cities of Mazandaran. As the seroprevalence of T. gondii in western and eastern Mazandaran was higher than that in the central cities, there is a need to evaluate the nature of the <b>infection</b> <b>chain</b> in these areas...|$|E
40|$|Skeletal {{tuberculosis}} is {{a well-known}} disease entity. We report the first case involving hyoid bone {{and the use of}} polymerase chain reaction-based test in detection and management. A 62 -year-old male presented with neck swelling of a 20 -day duration along with change of voice and dysphagia. Examination revealed a cystic, osteolytic lesion of the hyoid bone which histopathologically demonstrated features of granulomatous <b>infection.</b> A polymerase <b>chain</b> reaction test confirmed the diagnosis of tuberculosis...|$|R
40|$|Background/objectives: The {{criteria}} for the diagnosis of non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) on a Gram stained urethral smear are derived from previous studies which used culture as a diagnostic test for Chlamydia trachomatis. Our objectives were (1) to re-assess the relation between urethral polymorph count and C trachomatis <b>infection,</b> using ligase <b>chain</b> reaction (LCR) as the diagnostic test; and (2) to assess other possible predictors of C trachomatis infection such as symptoms, signs, demographic and behavioural variables...|$|R
40|$|Herpes folliculitis {{is a rare}} {{manifestation of}} herpes virus infection. It usually {{represents}} a diagnostic challenge, due {{to the absence of}} characteristic skin manifestations such as vesicles or pustules. The reported cases are mainly associated with varicella zoster virus (VZV) and less commonly with herpes simplex viruses (HSV- 1 y HSV- 2). We report a 51 -year-old male with a relapsing non-Hodgkin Lymphoma under chemotherapy, with history of extensive follicular lesions lasting one month. The pathologic study of the lesions was consistent with necrotizing herpes folliculitis. The patient was treated with Valacyclovir, achieving remission of the lesions. The appearance of folliculitis, especially in an immunocompromised patient, should raise the suspicion of herpes virus <b>infection.</b> Polymerase <b>chain</b> reaction may help to elucidate the diagnosis when pathologic findings are non-specific...|$|R
