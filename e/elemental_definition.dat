Beyond the literal meaning of property passed between generations, its contemporary evocations include 'inherited customs, beliefs and institutions held in common by a nation or community... [and] natural and "built" landscapes, buildings and environments held in trust for future generations' (Davison et. al. 1998, p. 308). Even this <b>elemental</b> <b>definition</b> strongly associates cultural institutions and heritage. Most cultural institutions articulate inherited customs and beliefs through a sense of heritage which, in turn, certifies their authenticity and legitimacy. Parliamentary conventions, halls of fame and honour boards, much judicial ritual, the use of uniforms, anniversary commemorations of all sorts and university degree conferring ceremonies are strong examples of such practices. At {{the same time the}} more material and codified notion of heritage as things held in trust explicitly organises the work of many cultural institutions. Open Acces...|$|E

This document {{has been created}} to serve two purposes: 1) to provide a quick reference of material compositions for analysts and 2) a standardized reference to reduce the differences between results from two independent analysts. Analysts are always encountering a variety of materials for which <b>elemental</b> <b>definitions</b> are not readily available or densities are not defined. This document provides a location where unique or hard to define materials will be located to reduce duplication in research for modeling purposes. Additionally, having {{a common set of}} material definitions helps to standardize modeling across PNNL and provide two separate researchers the ability to compare different modeling results from a common materials basis...|$|R

There is increasing interest and available resources for modeling three dimensional problems when the {{out of plane}} motion and influences are significant. Often the primary goal is to investigate wave interactions within a material structure or part definition, and wave excitation details are only of secondary importance. However, immersion ultrasound is often conducted with focused probes and at non-normal incident angles. This provides a challenge for modeling efforts due to non-planar wave fronts and complex mode conversion characteristics along the interface. Adding the full probe and water path to a model requires significantly more elements and computational resources. However, exploiting certain boundary condition options within PZFlex commercial software has been demonstrated toward achieving adequate efficiency gains for running practical models. Three approaches have been investigated for representing realistic 3 D behavior: 1) Full 3 D modeling of piezoelectric and lens components with “Free Field” (FFLD) boundary condition, 2) 3 D extrapolation from a 2 D axisymmetric probe model with FFLD boundary condition, and 3) <b>elemental</b> pressure wave <b>definitions</b> with phased array delay laws along a surface. Initial results, comparisons, and recommendations are discussed pertaining to these three approaches and their application toward practical ultrasound modeling efforts...|$|R
