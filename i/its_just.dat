[...] Timberlake revealed that he went [...] "left", regarding going more rock, not in how he developed the song, but in the way he sang the song.

Timberlake said that the song [...] "doesn't qualify as rock or straight funk" [...] and that he was happy with the description [...] "club funk". He was [...] "keen for a new musical direction" [...] following the release of his first album, Justified. [...] "I listened to the radio for a few months and thought, 'All this sounds like shit, what do I want to hear?'. That's really all I did.

When asked if they rehearse together to decide which facial expressions they will use to convey these emotions in any given scene, Hansis replied, [...] "No. We rehearse together {{to make sure we}} have the lines right.

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the New England Anti-Slavery Convention on May 30, 1850, an {{announcement}} was made that a meeting would be held to consider whether to hold a woman's rights convention. That evening, Paulina Kellogg Wright Davis presided over a large meeting in Boston's Melodeon Hall, while Lucy Stone served as secretary. Stone, Henry C. Wright, William Lloyd Garrison, and Samuel Brooke spoke of the need for such a convention. Garrison, whose name had headed the first woman suffrage petition sent to the Massachusetts legislature the previous year, said, [...] "I conceive that the first thing to be done by the women of this country is to demand their political enfranchisement. Among the 'self-evident truths' announced in the Declaration of Independence is this – 'All government derives <b>its</b> <b>just</b> power from the consent of the governed.'" [...] The meeting decided to call a convention and set Worcester, Massachusetts, as the place and October 16 and 17, 1850, as the date. It appointed Davis, Stone, Abby Kelley Foster, Harriot Kezia Hunt, Eliza J. Kenney, Dora Taft, and Eliza H.

2500|$|While {{the fact}} that The Precipice and Home of the Gentry had a lot in common, Goncharov's other {{allegations}} have been unanimously dismissed by literary historians as groundless. Parallels he's drawn between The Precipice and Turgenev's Fathers and Sons were proved to be far-fetched, as was his claim that Torrents of Spring, was 'an improvisation' on The Precipice part I. Goncharov's claims that some European authors started to use his ideas and character types through Turgenev's influence are seen to be void, although Budanova noted that [...] some contemporary critics might have prompted such an idea to the author who in his later life grew to be highly impressionable and suspicious. For example, Aleksey Suvorin in his article [...] "The French Society in Gustave Flaubert's new novel" [...] suggested that the Sentimental Education main character Frédéric Moreau was [...] "akin to the so-called 'people of the 1840s' in Russia {{and that he was}} [...] "similar to Raisky... <b>its</b> <b>just</b> that Flaubert has treated his character more objectively than our respected novelist."
