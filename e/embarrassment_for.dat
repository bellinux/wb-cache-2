5|$|The Itzas' {{continued}} resistance {{had become}} a major <b>embarrassment</b> <b>for</b> the Spanish colonial authorities, and soldiers were despatched from Campeche to take Nojpetén once and for all.

By this time the deep divisions between the political leaders of the Itza were such that a unified defence of the Itza kingdom had become impossible.|$|E

5|$|Aurora's {{passage from}} the ice towards safety proved slow and perilous. Coal {{supplies}} had to be conserved, allowing only limited use of the engines, and the improvised emergency rudder made steering difficult; the ship wallowed helplessly at times, in danger of foundering.

However, he was obliged to request help when, as Aurora neared New Zealand in stormy weather on 31 March, it was in danger of being driven on the rocks. Two days later the tug Dunedin reached the ship and a towline was secured. On the following morning, 3 April 1916, Aurora was brought into the harbour at Port Chalmers.|$|E

By 1900, the contracts were finally awarded, and Necm-i Şevket {{was not included in the}} program.

Following a lengthy process of negotiations, Krupp received the contract to rebuild Aziziye on 11 August 1900, along with several other warships. By December 1902, however, Krupp withdrew from the deal, and Aziziye was ultimately not reconstructed. She became a barracks ship in 1904, based in Kasımpaşa. On 31 July 1909, she was decommissioned, but remained in the Navy's inventory until 1923 when she was broken up.|$|E

5|$|The terms {{by which}} Kilij Arslan II allowed Manuel and his army to leave were {{that he should}} remove his forts and armies on the {{frontier}} at Dorylaeum and Sublaeum.

Nevertheless, defeat at Myriokephalon was an <b>embarrassment</b> <b>for</b> both Manuel personally and also for his empire. The Komnenian emperors had worked hard since the Battle of Manzikert, 105 years earlier, to restore the reputation of the empire. Yet because of his over-confidence, Manuel had demonstrated to the whole world that Byzantium still could not defeat the Seljuks, despite the advances made during the past century.

5|$|Despite {{their losses}} during the {{previous}} fighting, the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong appeared to have gained the initiative. Indeed, although the Tet offensive had devastated the Viet Cong, costing them about half their strength in the south, the Defense Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam—General Vo Nguyen Giap—had moved quickly to replace these losses with reinforcements, and by early May 15,000 North Vietnamese soldiers were serving in Viet Cong units in South Vietnam. On 8 April, Westmoreland launched a series of large-scale sweeps involving over 70,000 South Vietnamese, American, Australian, New Zealand and Thai troops, code-named Operation Toan Thang I. Meanwhile, on 5 May the Viet Cong launched attacks against 119 provincial and district capitals, military installations and major cities during the May Offensive {{in an attempt to}} gain an advantage at the first session of peace negotiations scheduled to begin in Paris on the 13th. Saigon was successfully infiltrated in an event that received widespread international media coverage and resulted in considerable <b>embarrassment</b> <b>for</b> the Americans and their allies, with as many as five of the 13 attacking Viet Cong battalions penetrating the city's outer defences, plunging the capital into chaos and resulting in heavy civilian casualties. After three days of intense fighting American and South Vietnamese forces successfully repelled the assault while, as the peace talks neared, a fresh wave of attacks was launched on Saigon several days later. However, by 12 May the fighting was over, and the communists were forced to withdraw having suffered more than 5,500 dead in just over one week of fighting. US casualties were also heavy, amounting to 652 killed and 2,225 wounded, which made it the most costly week of the war for the Americans.|$|E
5|$|Dominican missionaries {{were active}} in Verapaz and the {{southern}} Petén from the late 16th century through the 17th century, attempting non-violent conversion with limited success. In the 17th century the Franciscans {{came to the conclusion}} that the pacification and Christian conversion of the Maya would not be possible as long as the Itza held out at Lake Petén Itzá. The constant flow of escapees fleeing the Spanish-held territories to find refuge with the Itza was a drain on the encomiendas. Fray Bartolomé de Fuensalida visited Nojpetén in 1618 and 1619. The Franciscan missionaries attempted to use their own reinterpretation of the k'atun prophecies when they visited Nojpetén at this time, to convince the current Aj Kan Ek' and his Maya priesthood that the time for conversion had come. But the Itza priesthood interpreted the prophecies differently, and the missionaries were fortunate to escape with their lives. In 1695 the colonial authorities decided to connect the province of Guatemala with Yucatán, and Guatemalan soldiers conquered a number of Ch'ol communities, the most important being Sakb'ajlan on the Lacantún River in eastern Chiapas, now in Mexico, which was renamed as Nuestra Señora de Dolores, or Dolores del Lakandon. The Franciscan friar Andrés de Avendaño oversaw a second attempt to overcome the Itza in 1695, convincing the Itza king that the K'atun 8 Ajaw, a twenty-year Maya calendrical cycle beginning in 1696 or 1697, was the right time for the Itza to finally embrace Christianity and to accept the king of Spain as overlord. However the Itza had local Maya enemies who resisted this conversion, and in 1696 Avendaño was fortunate to escape with his life. The Itza's continued resistance had become a major <b>embarrassment</b> <b>for</b> the Spanish colonial authorities, and soldiers were despatched from Campeche to take Nojpetén once and for all.|$|E

50|$|Worcester had a keen {{interest}} in public health, but his response to a major 1902-04 outbreak of cholera in Manila and other Philippine cities was highly criticized. The epidemic was particularly severe in the district of Farola in Manila (near present-day San Nicolas) that was home to many of the city's poorest. Worcester ordered the burning of hundreds of houses and forced quarantine of many frightened and homeless Filipinos. Despite these draconian measures taken by Worcester and public health officials, 109,461 people died in Manila and elsewhere in the Philippines. Failure to effectively control this major outbreak and subsequent cholera outbreaks in 1905 and 1908 were major <b>embarrassments</b> <b>for</b> Worcester and drew the ire of the Philippine press often claiming that the public health measures were primarily aimed at clearing slums for the redevelopment of the valuable Manila seaport area. In response, the Insular Department of Interior, primarily under the authorship of Worcester, published a history of these cholera outbreaks with an account of the agency's attempts to control them.|$|R
