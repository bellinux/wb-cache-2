5|$|As a showman, Butlin {{quickly became}} successful, one stall {{becoming}} several, and several becoming his own travelling fair. Butlin soon had fixed <b>fairground</b> sites {{as well as}} his travelling fair – the first was at Olympia in London outside Bertram Mills' Circus. In 1925 he opened a set of <b>fairground</b> stalls in Barry Island, Wales where he observed the way landladies in seaside resorts would (sometimes literally) push families out of the lodgings between meals, and began to nurture the idea of a holiday camp similar to the one he had attended whilst an employee at Eatons.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the Brighton Marine Palace Pier Company (owned by the Noble Organisation), {{admitted}} {{an offence}} of breaching public safety under the Health and Safety at Work Act {{and had to}} pay fines and costs of £37,000 after a <b>fairground</b> ride was operated with part of its track missing. A representative from the Health and Safety Executive said that inadequate procedures were {{to blame for the}} fact that nothing had been done to alert staff or passengers that the ride would be dangerous to use. The pier management came into criticism from Brighton and Hove City Council, who thought they were relying too much on <b>fairground</b> rides, some of which were being built too high.|$|E
5|$|In Canada Butlin {{struggled}} {{to fit in}} at school and soon left {{for a job in}} a Toronto department store Eatons. In the First World War he enlisted as a bugler in the Canadian Army. After the war, Butlin returned to England, bringing only £5 with him. Investing £4 of that money to hire a stall travelling with his uncle's fair, Butlin discovered that giving his customers a better chance to win brought more custom in, and he quickly became successful. One stall became several, including prominent locations such as Olympia in London, and Butlin soon was able to purchase other <b>fairground</b> equipment, and started his own travelling fair. He proved successful in this endeavour as well, and by 1927 he opened a static <b>fairground</b> in Skegness. Over the next 10 years Butlin expanded his <b>fairground</b> empire, all the time harbouring an idea {{to increase the number of}} patrons in his Skegness site by providing accommodation.|$|E

50|$|Since 1985 the <b>fairgrounds</b> {{have been}} under Allegany County Government ownership. Prior to 1985 the <b>fairgrounds</b> was owned by {{numerous}} private individuals and a horse racing company once owned the <b>fairgrounds.</b> Also in 2011 after the big 2010 Elections some individuals that gave the county commissioners budget suggestions including on the <b>fairgrounds.</b> Under the <b>fairgrounds</b> there has been suggestion of partially privatisation to full private ownership of the <b>fairgrounds</b> prior to 1985 to save Allegany County Government nearly $500,000 in the full long run that would not begin a search until after the 2011 Allegany county Fair. There has also been stories of a potential horse racing returning to the <b>fairgrounds</b> with full-fledged indoor gambling {{that would result in}} the <b>fairgrounds</b> ceasing as a <b>fairgrounds</b> altogether due to possible better revenue in gambling and horse racing all year long.|$|R
5|$|Butlin {{opened a}} similar <b>fairground</b> in 1932, in Bognor Regis, {{on the corner}} of the Esplanade, named the Recreation Shelter. The {{following}} year he opened a zoo nearby, which featured polar bears, kangaroos and monkeys. At around the same time he also opened an amusement park in Bognor's neighbouring village of Littlehampton, known as Butlin's Park.|$|E
5|$|Camberwell Green, at the {{junction}} of Camberwell Road and Camberwell Church Street, was the traditional site of Camberwell Fair, an annual fair held every August. Following complaints about the noise and high crime levels generated by the fair, a group of residents bought the <b>fairground</b> in 1855, converting it into the park which remains today.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the venture}} {{was not as}} {{profitable}} as Méliès had expected; {{the high costs of}} the lavish hand-colored film put it {{out of the reach of}} many <b>fairground</b> exhibitors. These financial difficulties, which continued with Méliès's similarly spectacular film The Merry Frolics of Satan the following year, helped hasten the decline of Méliès's career.|$|E

Another notable Seattle Center building, the Museum of Pop Culture (earlier called EMP Museum), was built nearly 40years later and designed {{to fit in with}} the <b>fairground</b> atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Another {{potential}} Guitar Hero {{project was}} discovered by the archival site Unseen64 for a game titled Hero World, a massively multiplayer online game that would link the Guitar Hero and DJ Hero games. The game had been developed by FreeStyleGames, sometime {{after the release of}} DJ Hero 2, with the main development duties passed to Virtual <b>Fairground,</b> using their platform The Ride, an Adobe Flash-based platform that would let the game be played in a web browser. The game was cancelled in 2011 along with other pending Guitar Hero projects.|$|E
5|$|As planned, the {{exposition}} {{left behind}} a <b>fairground</b> and numerous public buildings and public works; some credit it with revitalizing Seattle's economic and cultural life (see History of Seattle since 1940). The fair saw {{the construction of the}} Space Needle and Alweg monorail, as well as several sports venues (Washington State Coliseum, now KeyArena) and performing arts buildings (the Playhouse, now the Cornish Playhouse), most of which have since been replaced or heavily remodeled.|$|E
50|$|Historically, the <b>fairgrounds</b> {{has held}} horse races. Racing at the <b>fairgrounds</b> started in 1936. The Gravenstein Apple Show Classic {{was held at}} the <b>fairgrounds,</b> as part of the Sonoma County Fair, until 1938.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fairgrounds</b> {{were built}} in 1917. Amherst hosts the Portage County Fair, an Amish craft fair, and other events at the <b>fairgrounds.</b> Stock car racing began at the <b>fairgrounds</b> in 2013 under the name Amherst Speedway.|$|R

5|$|Philip Marc Smith (born July 10, 1965 in Willenhall , England) is an English spree killer {{serving a}} life {{sentence}} for the murders of three women in Birmingham. A former <b>fairground</b> worker employed at the Rainbow public house in the Digbeth area of the city, Smith killed his victims over a four-day period in November 2000, befriending two of them at the Rainbow before carrying out the crimes. All three victims were mutilated almost beyond recognition, but Smith was quickly identified as the killer because of the overwhelming evidence linking him to the deaths.|$|E
5|$|The Palace Pier was {{constructed}} {{as a replacement}} for the Chain Pier, which collapsed in 1896 during construction. It quickly became popular, and had become a frequently-visited theatre and entertainment venue by 1911. Aside from closures owing to war, it continued to hold regular entertainment up to the 1970s. The theatre was damaged in 1973 and following a buy-out was demolished in 1986, changing the pier's character from seaside entertainment to an amusement park, with various <b>fairground</b> rides and roller coasters.|$|E
50|$|Cascade County {{owns the}} <b>fairgrounds.</b> By 1987, the <b>fairgrounds</b> {{were more than}} $600,000 in debt and Cascade County's {{management}} of the <b>Fairgrounds</b> and Four Seasons Arena was heavily criticized. In 1988, Cascade County signed an agreement under which the city of Great Falls took over management of the <b>fairgrounds</b> and Four Seasons Arena. This agreement expired after 15 years, and on November 12, 2002, Cascade County signed a formal agreement to allow SMG World to take over management of the <b>fairgrounds</b> and arena.|$|R

5|$|The pier {{was sold}} to the Noble Organisation in 1984. The theatre was removed two years later, on the {{understanding}} {{that it would be}} replaced; however a domed amusement arcade was put in place instead. Consequently, the seaward end of the pier was filled with <b>fairground</b> rides, including thrill rides, children's rides and roller coasters. Entertainment continued to be popular at the pier; the Spice Girls made an early live performance there in 1996 and returned the following year after achieving commercial success.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1850s, St. Louis hosted annual {{agricultural}} and mechanical fairs at <b>Fairground</b> Park {{to connect with}} regional manufacturers and growers. By the 1880s, the connection to agriculture had declined, and in 1883, a new St. Louis Exposition and Music Hall was built to house industrial exhibits. In 1890, St. Louis attempted to host the World's Columbian Exposition, but the project was awarded to Chicago, which hosted the exposition in 1893. In 1899, delegates from states that {{had been part of}} the Louisiana Purchase met in St. Louis, selecting it as the site of a world's fair celebrating the centennial of the purchase in 1904.|$|E
5|$|When Oblivion did open, {{the area}} was re-themed {{to look like a}} {{sinister}} government facility, unlike Fantasy World's <b>fairground</b> theme, and renamed X-Sector. The only surviving ride from Fantasy World, the Black Hole roller coaster, was also changed; the large tent that it was situated in was repainted to blue and silver instead of green and yellow stripes. To make the new X-Sector a major ride area, Alton Towers added two old rides {{from other parts of the}} park: Energizer and Enterprise (both from Festival Park, now Dark Forest). Both rides were repainted to fit to the new theme.|$|E
50|$|The Montana State <b>Fairgrounds</b> Racetrack, {{also known}} as the Lewis and Clark County <b>Fairgrounds</b> Racetrack and as Helena Downs, is a {{historic}} horse racing track located on the outskirts of Helena, Montana, in the United States. Constructed in 1870, the track was part of the Montana State <b>Fairgrounds,</b> now the Lewis and Clark County <b>Fairgrounds.</b> The racetrack was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 20, 2006.

5|$|Brady and Hindley {{visited a}} <b>fairground</b> on 26 December 1964, {{in search of}} another victim, and noticed 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey {{standing}} beside one of the rides. When {{it became apparent that}} she was on her own, they approached her and deliberately dropped some of the shopping they were carrying close to her, before asking for the girl's help to carry some of the packages to their car, and then to their home. Once inside the house Downey was undressed, gagged and forced to pose for photographs before being raped and killed, perhaps strangled with a piece of string. Hindley maintained that she went to fill a bath for the child and found the girl dead (presumably killed by Brady) when she returned. In Chris Cowley's book Face to Face with Evil: Conversations with Ian Brady, Brady states that it was Hindley who killed Downey. The following morning Brady and Hindley drove with Downey's body to Saddleworth Moor, where she was buried, naked with her clothes at her feet, in a shallow grave.|$|E
5|$|Cloud Gate is {{described}} as a transformative, iconic work. It is similar to many of Kapoor's previous works in the themes and issues it addresses. While the sculpture's mirror effects are reminiscent of fun-house <b>fairground</b> mirrors, they also have a more serious intent; they help dematerialize this very large object, making it seem light and almost weightless. Cloud Gate is considered Kapoor's most ambitious use of complex mirrored form dynamics. Kapoor challenges his viewers to internalize his work through intellectual and theoretical exercise. By reflecting the sky, visiting and non-visiting pedestrians and surrounding architecture, Cloud Gate limits its viewers to partial comprehension at any time. The interaction with the viewer who moves to create his own vision gives it a spiritual dimension. The sculpture {{is described}} as a disembodied, luminous form, which is also how his earlier 1000 Names (197980) was described when it addressed the metaphysical and mystical.|$|E
5|$|Giles' dream {{begins with}} Giles {{swinging}} a watch {{in front of}} Buffy. They are in Giles' apartment, which has been stripped of furniture but for a chair and a bed. She laughs, and Giles' dream cuts to a family scene with Buffy and his girlfriend Olivia at a <b>fairground.</b> Quicker than the others to understand that something is wrong, he confronts Spike, who is posing for a photo-shoot in his crypt. In The Bronze, he meets Anya failing as a stand-up comic, and Willow and Xander (with a bloody chest wound), who warn him of their attacker. He breaks into song, giving {{suggestions on how to}} deal with what hunts them, but when the sound system breaks down, he crawls backstage to trace a wiring fault. He begins to realize his pursuer is the First Slayer, just as she scalps him.|$|E
50|$|Once {{arriving}} at Rush Creek/Athol Springs, the train could divert to two branches; the Hamburg South Branch to the Village of Hamburg, or the Orchard Park Branch, towards Orchard Park. A spur, known in records as the <b>Fairgrounds</b> Spur, would operate {{off of the}} Hamburg South Branch to the Erie County <b>Fairgrounds.</b> The <b>Fairgrounds</b> Spur would be in operation during the summer season, to serve the Hamburg <b>Fairgrounds.</b>|$|R
50|$|Michigan State <b>Fairgrounds</b> Coliseum, {{also known}} as the Hockeytown State Fair Coliseum, is a 5,600-seat {{multi-purpose}} arena located on the <b>fairgrounds.</b> Two NASCAR races were held at a one-mile track at the <b>fairgrounds.</b> Tommy Thompson won the 1951 event and Tim Flock won in 1952.|$|R
