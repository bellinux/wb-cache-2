25|$|The {{only other}} major railway {{which was founded}} in this period was the Nederlandse Rhijnspoorweg-Maatschappij (NRS). The first line the NRS wanted to build ran from Amsterdam to Utrecht, Arnhem, and then on into Germany. They however only {{launched}} their plan shortly after the HSM had started constructing their first line, and could only <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> investors (mainly German). King William once again proved to be the saviour of the railway, when he personally vouched for the interest payments on the financing of the railroad. Once the funding was secured, the line could be completed. Like the HSM, the NRS made the odd decision to build the railway using a Dutch broad gauge of , while the connection in Germany was on standard gauge. The first stretch connecting Amsterdam to Utrecht opened on December 18, 1843, and the stretch to Arnhem was opened on May 16, 1845. The final stretch, the connection with Germany, was only completed 11 years later, in 1856, possibly because the railway first had to convert to standard gauge. The NRS also undertook the construction of the line from Rotterdam to Utrecht, thus connecting Rotterdam to Germany.|$|E

The subject of the July 1969 Moon landing dominated a contemporary review in The Milwaukee Journal, in which Bennett F. Waxse noted comparisons with Doppelgänger: [...] "...the spacemen <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> bugs in their 'LM' and crash on the planet. And do they ever have their hands full in getting back to Earth!" [...] Writing that the proliferation of technical dialogue hampers the acting, he concluded, [...] "...the makers of this space exploiter may get lots of mileage at the box office, but Neil, Buzz and Mike did it better on TV." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{they had}} {{demonstrated}} that the fission of uranium produced more neutrons than it consumed, this was still not a chain reaction. Szilard persuaded Fermi and Herbert L. Anderson to try a larger experiment using [...] of uranium. To maximize the chance of fission, they needed a neutron moderator to slow the neutrons down. Hydrogen was a known moderator, so they used water. The results were disappointing. It became apparent that hydrogen slowed neutrons down, but also absorbed them, leaving fewer for the chain reaction. Szilard then suggested Fermi use carbon, {{in the form of}} graphite. He felt he would need about [...] of graphite and [...] of uranium. As a back-up plan, Szilard also considered where he might <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> tons of heavy water; deuterium would not absorb neutrons like ordinary hydrogen, but would have the similar value as a moderator. Such quantities of materiel would require a lot of money.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the cases}} {{mentioned}} above, the pontificate of Innocent III marks also {{the beginning of}} the end of the [...] "external" [...] cardinalate. Stephen Langton was the last cardinal allowed by the Pope to become a diocesan bishop of the external see. From that time the popes constantly rejected all such postulations made by the cathedral chapters, indicating that the presence of the cardinals in the papal curia is indispensable. On the other hand, bishops appointed to the College of Cardinals were obliged to resign their sees (although it must be remarked that until the end of the 13th century they were appointed always to the rank of cardinal-bishop). It is still possible to <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> cases of the cardinals who exercised the posts of administrators of the episcopal sees, but only for a short time, often as part of their legatine duties. The last instance of external cardinal sensu stricto was abbot Riccardo of Montecassino (1252–1259/62). Generally already in the pontificate of Gregory IX (1227–1241), the College of Cardinals became an exclusively curial body, without any [...] "external" [...] element, and remained such until the Great Western Schism (1378–1417). However, during this time the rank of cardinal became also the highest in the Catholic Church, inferior only to the Pope.|$|E

2500|$|GameSpy's David Hodgson {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 and Xbox {{versions}} 3 out of 5, calling the game [...] "Oz meets Clive Barker, drenched in the entrails of Stephen King. It's survival-horror with swears. It's the proof the ESRB is kidding Congress with the non-existent [...] "Adults Only" [...] rating. It's offensive, psyche-damaging, brutal, makes no sense, and is unforgiving and violent. And damn good fun." [...] Scott Osborne scored the PC version 4 out of 5, writing [...] "The Suffering offers a smooth blend of survival horror and shooter action." [...] Of the PC port, he wrote [...] "you'll <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> bugs, clipping problems, and occasional clunky moments when a character's important dialogue {{is interrupted by}} that of a scripted event, creating an audio muddle. It's a shame The Suffering didn't receive a bit more polishing and a major graphics upgrade for the PC. Still, with its well-designed levels, fluid pacing, and hyper-violent combat in eerie locales, The Suffering is a fun way to safely tap into your dark side." ...|$|E
