50|$|Albert Hanson, a noted Saskatoon {{real estate}} agent, bought {{land in the}} Sutherland area {{beginning}} in 1905. He then sold some {{of it to the}} Canadian Pacific Railway, whose branch line between Regina and Edmonton reached Saskatoon in 1907. The area of Sutherland was built up as the CPR yards and station were constructed 3 mi east of Saskatoon. This was in keeping with the railway's practice of bypassing existing communities and building its own town sites on land it owned, thus sharing the real estate profits with no one. Hanson subdivided the rest of his land as residential and commercial properties, laid out on a typical north-south grid pattern. The railway's town site was on a <b>grid</b> <b>parallel</b> to the tracks, resulting in a triangular gap between the two areas. This became built up as an industrial area (later the separate Sutherland Industrial subdivision). Most of the subsequent population growth occurred on Hanson's land west of the tracks, {{due in part to the}} lack of schools or parks on the east side.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A novel {{technique}} is presented for the accurate, rapid, high frequency, predictive modeling of parallel plate capacitors with gridded plates manufactured in a multilayer low temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC) process. The method is empirical {{in nature and}} is based on the concept of incrementally constructing the model for a structure from well characterized individual building blocks. Building blocks are characterized by the use of test structures and measurements, and are modeled using passive lumped circuit elements. This method is applied to the predictive modeling of deeply embedded <b>gridded</b> <b>parallel</b> plate capacitor structures. The procedure has been experimentally verified, with accurate predictions of behavior obtained up to the second self resonance for large area <b>gridded</b> <b>parallel</b> plate capacitors. Since lumped element circuits are generated by this method, structure prediction speed is determined by circuit size and simulator small signal analysis time. The method is versatile and is well suited for circuit design applications.

Moreover, for PARAFAC based schemes, errors in some dimensions do not affect the estimation of parameters in the other dimensions. Par-ticularly, the closed-form PARAFAC based parameter estimator has the additional advantage of being non-iterative. In this contribution, we propose a PARAFAC decomposition for colored noise with a Kronecker structure called Sequen-tial Generalized Singular Value Decomposition (S-GSVD) based closed-form PARAFAC. Our proposed estimator joins the advan-tages of the closed-form PARAFAC — such as the applicability to mixed array geometries and the robustness to arrays with positioning errors — with the suitability of the S-GSVD for data contaminated by Kronecker colored noise or interference.
