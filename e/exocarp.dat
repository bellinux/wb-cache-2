25|$|As the ovules {{develop into}} seeds, the ovary begins to ripen and the ovary wall, the pericarp, may become fleshy (as in berries or drupes), or form a hard outer {{covering}} (as in nuts). In some multiseeded fruits, {{the extent to}} which the flesh develops is proportional to the number of fertilized ovules. The pericarp is often differentiated into two or three distinct layers called the <b>exocarp</b> (outer layer, also called epicarp), mesocarp (middle layer), and endocarp (inner layer). In some fruits, especially simple fruits derived from an inferior ovary, other parts of the flower (such as the floral tube, including the petals, sepals, and stamens), fuse with the ovary and ripen with it. In other cases, the sepals, petals and/or stamens and style of the flower fall off. When such other floral parts are a significant part of the fruit, it is called an accessory fruit. Since other parts of the flower may contribute to the structure of the fruit, it is important to study flower structure to understand how a particular fruit forms.|$|E
500|$|The fruit matures in {{late summer}} or autumn, and cultivars exist {{with a wide range}} of sizes. Commercial growers aim to produce an apple that is [...] in diameter, due to market preference. Some consumers, {{especially}} those in Japan, prefer a larger apple, while apples below [...] are generally used for making juice and have little fresh market value. The skin of ripe apples is generally red, yellow, green, pink, or russetted although many bi- or tri-colored cultivars may be found. The skin may also be wholly or partly russeted i.e. rough and brown. The skin is covered in a protective layer of epicuticular wax. The <b>exocarp</b> (flesh) is generally pale yellowish-white, though pink or yellow exocarps also occur.|$|E
500|$|Cucurbita fruits {{are large}} and fleshy. Botanists {{classify}} the Cucurbita fruit as a pepo, which is a special type of berry derived from an inferior ovary, with a thick outer wall or rind with hypanthium tissue forming an <b>exocarp</b> around the ovary, and a fleshy interior composed of mesocarp and endocarp. The term [...] "pepo" [...] is used primarily for Cucurbitaceae fruits, where this fruit type is common, but the fruits of Passiflora and Carica are sometimes also pepos. The seeds, which {{are attached to the}} ovary wall (parietal placentation) and not to the center, {{are large and}} fairly flat with a large embryo that consists almost entirely of two cotyledons. Fruit size varies considerably: wild fruit specimens can be as small as [...] and some domesticated specimens can weigh well over [...] The current world record was set in 2014 by Beni Meier of Switzerland with a [...] pumpkin.|$|E
30|$|It was {{concluded}} {{that a large number}} of microorganisms can be isolated directly from coffee <b>exocarps</b> in natural environments to aid biodegradation of coffee <b>exocarps</b> at coffee-producing areas in Vietnam and can be used for cellulose biodegradation.|$|R
30|$|We {{concluded}} that the cellulolytic bacteria and actinomycete could be isolated from coffee <b>exocarps</b> which are normally discharged into the environment in coffee-producing areas. These microorganisms {{could be used to}} decompose cellulosic wastes, making compost from coffee <b>exocarps,</b> which could be applied in agriculture in Vietnam and other developing countries.|$|R
30|$|Microorganisms {{have been}} used to {{decompose}} cellulolytic waste in agriculture for the past many years. However, much of the cellulosic waste including coffee <b>exocarps</b> which are wastes from raw coffee process in Vietnam is often disposed of by biomass burning and discharged into the environment in developing countries, thus causing considerable environmental pollution. Besides, these organic wastes decompose slowly when they are used to produce compost in ordinary conditions. Therefore, using microorganisms to manufacture natural compost from coffee <b>exocarps</b> is considered a useful and environmentally sound alternative.|$|R
2500|$|Pepos, {{characterized}} by a hard outer rind, have also been used as containers by removing the inner flesh and seeds and then drying the remaining <b>exocarp.</b> The English name of Lagenaria siceraria, [...] "bottle gourd", reflects its use as a liquid container.|$|E
2500|$|In botanical language, a berry is {{a simple}} fruit having seeds and fleshy pulp (the pericarp) {{produced}} from the ovary of a single flower. The ovary can be inferior or superior. It is indehiscent, i.e. {{it does not have}} a special [...] "line of weakness" [...] along which it splits to release the seeds when ripe. The pericarp is divided into three layers. The outer layer is called the [...] "exocarp" [...] or [...] "epicarp"; the middle layer, the [...] "mesocarp" [...] or [...] "sarcocarp"; the inner layer, the [...] "endocarp". Botanists have not applied these terms consistently. <b>Exocarp</b> and endocarp may be restricted to more-or-less single-layered [...] "skins", or may include tissues adjacent to them; thus on one view, the <b>exocarp</b> extends inwards to the layer of vascular bundles ("veins"). The inconsistency in usage has been described as [...] "a source of confusion".|$|E
5000|$|Botanically, {{the coconut}} fruit is a drupe, {{not a true}} nut. Like other fruits, it has three layers: the <b>exocarp,</b> {{mesocarp}}, and endocarp. The <b>exocarp</b> and mesocarp make up the [...] "husk" [...] of the coconuts. Coconuts sold in the shops of nontropical countries often have had the <b>exocarp</b> (outermost layer) removed. The mesocarp is composed of a fiber, called coir, which has many traditional and commercial uses. The shell has three germination pores (micropyles) or [...] "eyes" [...] that are clearly visible on its outside surface once the husk is removed.|$|E
30|$|Also nine {{isolated}} bacterial strains and six isolated actinomycetes strains, which scored negative on the cellulose-degrading test, after tested 10  days of incubation, digested in {{that time}} over 80 and 50  %, respectively, of the supplied cellulose when grown in shaken flasks, respectively. The submerged cultures allow a faster metabolism, probably due to better contact of cells with the cellulose fibers in the liquid medium. It was confirmed using microscopic examination that the strains B 4, B 7, and A 1, which digested over 90 and 80  % of the cellulose after 10  days of incubation, respectively, were completely lysed {{in that time}}. By comparison, cellulose-degrading capacity of the isolated microorganism strains was high (> 96  %) with filter paper; however, for coffee <b>exocarps</b> were lower, and only about 37  % of the cellulose was digested after 30  days. Cellulose biodegradation of coffee <b>exocarps</b> was observed with nine bacterial strains and four actinomycetes strains. These results are in consistent with previous reports (Godden et al. 1992; Crawford 1983); actinomycetes thus are important agents of lignocellulose degradation, although their ability to degrade cellulose and lignin is {{not as high as}} that of fungi. Nonetheless, it is possible to isolate microorganisms directly from coffee <b>exocarps</b> to aid biodegradation of coffee <b>exocarps</b> in the areas of coffee processing.|$|R
40|$|The β-glucosides of coumarinic and o-coumaric acids were {{detected}} in extracts of cotyledons, <b>exocarps,</b> and seedling {{leaves of the}} tonka bean. The existence of these compounds {{and the presence of}} a β-glucosidase having specificity for coumarinyl glucoside suggest that, the tonka bean synthesizes coumarin by a pathway similar to the one found in sweetclover...|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Table  1, the {{cellulolytic}} activity of A 1, A 9, B 4, and B 7 strains appeared more predominant than other isolates when coffee <b>exocarps</b> and filter paper were added. So, {{it was decided}} to use these actinomycetes and bacterial isolates for further studies. It is generally known that microorganisms continually sense environmental conditions to adapt their growth and development, and enzymes synthesis (cellulase, protease) in particular is greatly influenced by many factors, of which the most important is culture conditions. We studied some of the environmental factors influencing cellulolytic activity of the isolated bacteria and actinomycetes strains.|$|R
50|$|Peel, {{also known}} as rind or skin, is the outer {{protective}} layer of a fruit or vegetable which can be peeled off. The rind is usually the botanical <b>exocarp,</b> but the term <b>exocarp</b> also includes the hard cases of nuts, which are not named peels since they are not peeled off by hand or peeler, but rather shells because of their hardness.|$|E
50|$|The {{subsurface}} {{chemistry of}} the mangosteen <b>exocarp</b> comprises {{an array of}} polyphenols, including xanthones and tannins that assure astringency which discourages infestation by insects, fungi, plant viruses, bacteria and animal predation while the fruit is immature. Colour changes and softening of the <b>exocarp</b> are natural processes of ripening that indicates the fruit can be eaten and the seeds have finished developing.|$|E
50|$|The {{juvenile}} mangosteen fruit, {{which does}} not require fertilisation to form (see agamospermy), first appears as pale green or almost white {{in the shade of}} the canopy. As the fruit enlarges over the next two to three months, the <b>exocarp</b> colour deepens to darker green. During this period, the fruit increases in size until its <b>exocarp</b> is 6 - 8 cm in outside diameter, remaining hard until a final, abrupt ripening stage.|$|E
40|$|Subfossil fecal pellets {{associated}} with Archaeolemur cf. edwardsi skeletal material from Anjohikely Cave in north-western Madagascar were probably derived from this large extinct lemur. Pellets were photographed, measured, and dissected. One of the pellets dates to 830 ± 60 years BP. Pellets contain {{a wide variety}} of items indicative of omnivory, including fibrous fruit <b>exocarps</b> and seeds; bat, rodent, frog, and lizard bone; gastropod shell; and crustacean and arthropod exoskeletons—all within a matrix of comminuted vegetation. Pollen contents from inside intact pellets support other paleoecological evidence that recent feeding had taken place in wooded grassland habitat. This diet is consistent with ethnohistorical data and anatomical studies that indicate hard-object feeding in Archaeolemur. Archaeolemur may have deliberately entered caves to forage, although caves would also have offered water, abundant shade, cool conditions, cryptic sleeping sites, and refuge from predators. Cave-exploring behavior is rare in primates, but consistent with anatomical evidence that Archaeolemur was well adapted for terrestrial locomotion as well as arboreal climbing...|$|R
6000|$|... 3. It {{has been}} the {{practice}} of botanists of all nations to consider {{the seeds of the}} grasses together with those of roses and pease, as if all could be described on the same principles, and with the same nomenclature of parts. But the grain of corn is a quite distinct thing from the seed of pease. In it, the husk and the seed envelope have become inextricably one. All the <b>exocarps,</b> endocarps, epicarps, mesocarps, shells, husks, sacks, and skins, are woven at once together into the brown bran; and inside of that, a new substance is collected for us, which is not what we boil in pease, or poach in eggs, or munch in nuts, or grind in coffee;--but a thing which, mixed with water and then baked, has given to all {{the nations of the world}} their prime word for food, in thought and prayer,--Bread; their prime conception of the man's and woman's labor in preparing it--("whoso putteth hand to the plough"--two women shall be grinding at the mill)--their prime notion of the means of cooking by fire--("which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven"), and their prime notion of culinary office--the [...] "chief baker," [...] cook, or pastrycook,--(compare Bedreddin Hassan in the Arabian Nights): and, finally, to modern civilization, the Saxon word 'lady,' with whatever it imports.|$|R
5000|$|Over {{the days}} {{following}} removal from the tree, the <b>exocarp</b> hardens to an extent depending upon post-harvest handling and [...] storage conditions, especially relative humidity levels. If the ambient humidity is high, <b>exocarp</b> hardening may take a week or longer when the flesh quality is peaking and excellent for consumption. However, after several additional days of storage, especially if unrefrigerated, the flesh inside the fruit might spoil without any obvious external indications. Using the hardness of the rind {{as an indicator of}} freshness for the first two weeks following harvest is therefore unreliable because the rind does not accurately reveal the interior condition of the flesh. If the <b>exocarp</b> is soft and yielding as it is when ripe and fresh from the tree, the fruit is usually good.|$|E

5000|$|Epicarp (from epi-, [...] "on" [...] or [...] "upon" [...] + -carp, [...] "fruit") is a botanical {{term for}} the {{outermost}} layer of the pericarp (or fruit).

50|$|Pulp cells {{often have}} thin membranes, {{and they are}} less regular in shape than other plant cells. They are also very large and protect {{the seeds of the}} fruit.

50|$|Several {{characteristics}} between pomegranate genotypes vary for identification, consumer preference, preferred use, and marketing, {{the most}} important of which are fruit size, <b>exocarp</b> color (ranging from yellow to purple, with pink and red most common), seed-coat color (ranging from white to red), hardness of seed, maturity, juice content and its acidity, sweetness, and astringency.|$|E
50|$|Once the {{developing}} mangosteen fruit has stopped expanding, chlorophyll synthesis slows {{as the next}} colour phase begins.

50|$|The female beetle lays {{a single}} egg {{on the outside}} of a palm seed. Eggs are only laid on a seed if it has had the <b>exocarp</b> and {{mesocarp}} removed, probably by rodents, revealing the smooth endocarp (see fruit anatomy).

50|$|A {{fruit with}} a thick peel, such as a citrus fruit, is called a hesperidium. In hesperidiums, the inner layer (also called albedo or, among non-botanists, pith) is peeled off {{together}} with the outer layer (called flavedo), and together they are called the peel. The flavedo and albedo, respectively, are the <b>exocarp</b> and the mesocarp. The juicy layer inside the peel (containing the seeds) is the endocarp.|$|E
50|$|Elaiosomes {{develop in}} various ways either from seed tissues (chalaza, funiculus, hilum, raphe-antiraphe) or from fruit tissues (<b>exocarp,</b> receptacle, flower tube, perigonium, style or spicule).
