25|$|At {{the age of}} twenty-two, on {{graduating from}} Cambridge, Hutchinson {{traveled}} to Italy on a Rockefeller Higher Education Fellowship {{to work at the}} Stazione Zoologica. He was interested <b>in</b> <b>doing</b> <b>research</b> on the branchial gland of the octopus. He wanted to establish endocrine function in higher invertebrates. He thought that the branchial gland was the endocrine gland in the octopus, but an octopus shortage put an end to his research. He returned to Italy many times for Italian art, folklore, and to study his Italian ancestry.|$|E

In a few weeks, she gained what she called a [...] "treasure trove of show-boat material, human, touching, true". Jerome Kern {{was impressed by the}} novel and, hoping to adapt it as a musical, asked the critic Alexander Woollcott to introduce him to Ferber in October 1926. Woollcott introduced them that evening during the intermission of Kern's latest musical, Criss Cross.|$|E
500|$|A {{term paper}} Ramsey wrote for Goldhaber on {{magnetic}} moments {{caused him to}} read recent papers on the subject by Isidor Isaac Rabi, and this stimulated an interest in molecular beams, and <b>in</b> <b>doing</b> <b>research</b> for a Ph.D. under Rabi at Columbia. Soon after Ramsey arrived at Columbia, Rabi invented molecular beam resonance spectroscopy, {{for which he was}} awarded the Nobel prize in physics in 1944. Ramsey was part of Rabi's team that also included Jerome Kellogg, Polykarp Kusch, Sidney Millman and Jerrold Zacharias. Ramsey [...] worked with them on the first experiments making use of the new technique, and shared with Rabi and Zacharias in the discovery that the deuteron was a magnetic quadrupole. This meant that the atomic nucleus was not spherical, as had been thought. He received his Ph.D. in physics from Columbia in 1940, and became a fellow at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C., [...] where he [...] studied neutron-proton and proton-helium scattering.|$|E

500|$|After being captured, Woodruff {{was imprisoned}} in the Changi Prison Camp. In the camp, Woodruff {{realized}} that his fellow prisoners were at great risk from vitamin deficiencies due to the poor quality of the rations they were issued by the Japanese. To help fight this threat, Woodruff asked for permission from the Japanese {{to allow him to}} take responsibility for the matter, which was granted. He devised a method for extracting important nutrients from grass, soya beans, rice polishings, and agricultural wastes using old machinery that he found at the camp. Woodruff later published an account of his methods through the Medical Research Council titled [...] "Deficiency Diseases in Japanese Prison Camps". Woodruff remained a POW for three and a half years and later during this period he was sent to outlying POW camps to treat his comrades. As the prisoners were not allowed to be transferred, he had to improvise in his practise. During this time he also read Maingot's surgery textbook, as a copy was in the camp, and he later said that reading about the fact that skin allografts were rejected a fortnight after being initially accepted, had stoked his interest <b>in</b> <b>doing</b> <b>research</b> on the topic.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{reference}} to the nickname [...] "Miners" [...] {{is found in the}} February 1919 (volume 1, number 1) issue of the Prospector, the school's student newspaper. However, an earlier reference {{can be found in the}} handwritten bill (Senate Bill 183) that established the school in 1913, where the author, State Senator Claude Hudspeth, mistakenly wrote [...] "Miners" [...] instead of [...] "Mines," [...] and thus referred to the school as the [...] "State School of Miners and Metallurgy." [...] It is presumed the nickname [...] "Miners" [...] came from the fact the school was founded as the [...] "State School of Mines and Metallurgy." [...] <b>In</b> <b>doing</b> <b>research</b> on this project, early mention of [...] "Ore Diggers" [...] and [...] "Muckers" [...] for the nickname was found, but nothing to determine if the name [...] "Miners" [...] was voted upon by the student body, or if a faculty member, John W. (Cap) Kidd, chose the name. Kidd was a big booster of athletics, especially football, and in 1915, when funds were lean at the school, Kidd donated $800 to equip the football team, though there is no evidence other than anecdotal he contributed this amount. He also assisted with coaching, although he was not the head coach. The present track facility on campus, Kidd Field, bears Cap Kidd's name.|$|E
