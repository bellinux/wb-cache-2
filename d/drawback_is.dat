5|$|Flux-cored wire is {{considered}} to have some advantages for outdoor welding on-site, as the shielding gas plume {{is less likely to}} be blown away in a wind than shield gas from a conventional nozzle. A slight <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> that, like SMAW (stick) welding, there may be some flux deposited over the weld bead, requiring more of a cleaning process between passes.|$|E
5|$|Research on a cleaner, less {{energy-intensive}} lead {{extraction process}} continues; a major <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> that either too much lead is lost as waste, or the alternatives {{result in a}} high sulfur content in the resulting lead metal. Hydrometallurgical extraction, in which anodes of impure lead are immersed into an electrolyte and pure lead is deposited onto a cathode, is a technique that may have potential.|$|E
5|$|There is an inherent, {{systemic}} {{problem with}} any metric based on comparing {{with one or}} a few reference translations: in real life, sentences can be translated in many different ways, sometimes with no overlap. Therefore, the approach of comparing by how much any given translation result by a computer differs from just a few human translations is flawed. HyTER is another automated MT metric that compares to very many translations in a reference grammar defined by human translators; the <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> then that the human effort involved in correctly defining the combinatorially many ways to render the meaning of the translation in practice means HyTER also is only an approximation.|$|E

5|$|Because {{pure silver}} is very soft, most silver used for these {{purposes}} is alloyed with copper, with finenesses of 925/1000, 835/1000, and 800/1000 being common. One <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> the easy tarnishing of {{silver in the}} presence of hydrogen sulfide and its derivatives. Including precious metals such as palladium, platinum, and gold gives resistance to tarnishing but is quite costly; base metals like zinc, cadmium, silicon, and germanium do not totally prevent corrosion and tend to affect the lustre and colour of the alloy. Electrolytically refined pure silver plating is effective at increasing resistance to tarnishing. The usual solutions for restoring the lustre of tarnished silver are dipping baths that reduce the silver sulfide surface to metallic silver, and cleaning off the layer of tarnish with a paste; the latter approach also has the welcome side effect of polishing the silver concurrently.|$|E
5|$|Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) was {{designed}} by Microsoft to give higher-level access to a device's filesystem than USB mass storage, {{at the level of}} files rather than disk blocks. It also has optional DRM features. MTP {{was designed}} for use with portable media players, but it has since been adopted as the primary storage access protocol of the Android operating system from the version 4.1 Jelly Bean as well as Windows Phone 8 (Windows Phone 7 devices had used the Zune protocol which was an evolution of MTP). The primary {{reason for this is that}} MTP does not require exclusive access to the storage device the way UMS does, alleviating potential problems should an Android program request the storage while it is attached to a computer. The main <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> that MTP is not as well supported outside of Windows operating systems.|$|E
5|$|The {{synthesis}} of the heavy isotopes 294Lv and 295Lv could be accomplished by fusing the heavy curium isotope curium-250 with calcium-48. The cross section of this nuclear reaction would be about 1picobarn, {{though it is not}} yet possible to produce 250Cm in the quantities needed for target manufacture. After a few alpha decays, these livermorium isotopes would reach nuclides at the line of beta stability. Additionally, electron capture may also become an important decay mode in this region, allowing affected nuclei to reach the middle of the island. For example, 295Lv would alpha decay to 291Fl, which would undergo successive electron capture to 291Nh and then 291Cn which is expected {{to be in the middle}} of the island of stability and have a half-life of about 1200years, affording the most likely hope of reaching the middle of the island using current technology. A <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> that the decay properties of superheavy nuclei this close to the line of beta stability are largely unexplored.|$|E

25|$|Their main <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> {{that they}} cannot achieve the high {{compression}} ratio of reciprocating compressors without multiple stages. There are few one-stage centrifugal compressors capable of pressure ratios over 10:1, due to stress considerations which severely limit the compressor's safety, durability and life expectancy.|$|E

25|$|Boussinesq {{equations}} — {{have the}} same range of validity as the KdV equation (in their classical form), but allow for wave propagation in arbitrary directions, so not only forward-propagating waves. The <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> that the Boussinesq equations are often more difficult to solve than the KdV equation; and in many applications wave reflections are small and may be neglected.|$|E
25|$|Another {{potential}} <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> {{health issues}} {{that can occur}} during the stay in a foreign country.

25|$|Distributed {{hash tables}} use a more {{structured}} key-based routing {{in order to}} attain both the decentralization of Freenet and gnutella, and the efficiency and guaranteed results of Napster. One <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> that, like Freenet, DHTs only directly support exact-match search, rather than keyword search, although Freenet's routing algorithm can be generalized to any key type where a closeness operation can be defined.|$|E

25|$|Reciprocal space {{methods have}} been used {{extensively}} {{for their ability to}} evaluate enormous numbers of configurations.

25|$|The {{process of}} {{altering}} cloud precipitation {{can be done}} with the use of dry ice. It was widely used in experiments in the US in the 1950s and early 60s before it was replaced by silver iodide. Dry ice has the advantage of being relatively cheap and completely non-toxic. Its main <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> the need to be delivered directly into the supercooled region of clouds being seeded.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the easiest}} face vise to install is the {{self-contained}} iron vise, {{sometimes called the}} 'quick-action' vise (except they are not all quick-action). This tool comes already assembled and only has to be mounted to the bench. Usually, auxiliary wooden jaws are added. The quick-action feature makes setting it much quicker and is quickly taken for granted. Not only are these vises easy to install and use, they are also robust. Their main <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> the relatively high cost.|$|E

30|$|The {{structure}} {{of this paper}} is the following. In Section 2 a sensitivity analysis of the bishrink filter is presented and some of its <b>drawbacks</b> <b>are</b> identified. Then a solution to reduce these <b>drawbacks</b> <b>is</b> proposed and analyzed. In Section 3 all the details of the proposed denoising algorithm are given. Section 4 is dedicated to the presentation of the simulation results and to some comparisons with the best available wavelet based image denoising results conceived to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The paper's conclusion is formulated in Section 5.|$|R
25|$|In contrast, normal {{order is}} so called {{because it always}} finds a {{normalising}} reduction, if one exists. In the above example, KIΩ reduces under normal order to I, a normal form. A <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> that redexes in the arguments may be copied, resulting in duplicated computation (for example, (λx.xx) ((λx.x)y) reduces to ((λx.x)y) ((λx.x)y) using this strategy; now there are two redexes, so full evaluation needs two more steps, but if the argument had been reduced first, there would now be none).|$|E
25|$|A second, {{quite common}} type {{looks like a}} Schuko socket, but adds a central {{earthing}} hole. This design can accept CEE7/4 (German), CEE7/7 (German/French), and Italian 10A plugs. Some of these sockets may also have figure-8 shaped holes to accept Italian 16A plugs as well. Its <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> that it is {{twice as large as}} a normal Italian socket and the price is higher; for those reasons Schuko and bipasso-Schuko socket have been rarely installed in Italy until recent times.|$|E
25|$|The ARV Super2 has {{received}} favourable reviews which {{describe it as}} an aircraft with excellent visibility that is pleasant to fly. The small wing area and the fairly high wing loading produces handling that is responsive but stable. A <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> the shortage of luggage space which makes the ARV unsuitable for touring. The second prototype, G-STWO, has a fuselage luggage compartment aft of the fuel tank which is accessed from the starboard aside, but no other ARVs have this feature.|$|E
