50|$|Kitchen and Bath Division: This is Teka’s largest {{business}} unit {{and one of}} the most important in the production of built-in electrical appliances and in stainless steel sinks. The most important products it manufactures are induction cooktops, glass-ceramic hobs, gas cooktops, ovens, microwaves and extractor hoods. It also produces and distributes kitchen and bathroom taps and all kinds of bathroom fittings both for public facilities as well as for homes. The division also produces ceramic <b>glazes</b> for <b>steel</b> and cast iron. Since a plant was set up in the Chinese city of Weihai, in 2009, a business line has been opened that focuses on the supply of cold components for thermal power plants. The division commercializes its products under the Teka, Küppersbusch, Mofém, Thor and Vitrogar brand names. It owns 15 factories: 2 in America, 3 in Asia, 2 in Turkey and in the rest in Europe. Its CEO is Dr. Stefan Hoetzl.|$|R
40|$|The Centre for Fine Print Research at the University of the West of England has {{recently}} installed a large-scale kiln for firing enamel on metal panels used in public art projects. This has necessitated research into methods of transferring digital photographic imagery printed using vitreous enamel <b>glaze</b> onto <b>steel</b> and copper sheets. The panels {{have to be}} light fast, vandal proof {{and be able to}} withstand outdoor weather conditions for approximately thirty years. In order to obtain the best quality photographic rendition and to guarantee accurate registration large-scale decals have to be used. Two primary methods of transferring a digital image to a decal have been investigated to date. The investigation compares commercial electrostatic ceramic decals to a new screen printed decal system patented by the CFPR. The problem is a balance between ink deposition, photographic rendition, thermal shock effects and particle size and deposition. Microphotographs comparing decals before and after firing to ascertain strength of deposition, colour quality and ability to flux with the basecoat demonstrate the results. Some of the problems encountered will be discussed and examples of public art projects completed {{as a result of the}} study will be demonstrated. ...|$|R

5000|$|Following {{its opening}} by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 May 1980 the new square {{attracted}} {{criticism from the}} general public. The Melbourne Age newspaper reported [...] "in interviews with newspaper reporters and on talk-back radio, many Melburnians have blasted their long awaited City Square for {{what they see as}} its bareness, the noise from its controversial video matrix screen and the starkness of the <b>glazed</b> <b>steel</b> canopy running along the Regent Theatre Wall". A large yellow steel sculpture titled “Vault” by Ron Robertson-Swann (dubbed the [...] "Yellow Peril") which was commissioned as a centrepiece for the square was relocated to Batman Park in July 1981, following heated public debate.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of laser {{parameters}} on the properties of <b>glazed</b> die <b>steel</b> were investigated. A Rofin DC- 015 diffusion-cooled CO 2 slab laser with 10. 6 µm wavelength was used. Die steel sample surfaces were prepared with a 3 µm roughness and chemically treated to improve CO 2 laser wavelength absorbance. One set of processing parameters were processed through the thermal simulation program and correlated with physical results determined from actual test samples. Set processing parameters were 1138 W peak power, 2900 Hz PRF, 24 % duty cycle and 261 mm/s traverse speed. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) micrographs and micro-hardness properties of the affected surface were measured. An analytical mathematical model of the heat field generated in the laser glazing process was used to predict the nominal temperature distribution in the surface and dimensions of melt pool. A thermal model using point source surface energy inputs was used to predict the thermal profiles in the die steel. This allowed estimation of the depths of microstructurally altered regions. For higher energy absorbance, {{the depth of the}} glazed surface increased from 20 μm to 40 μm. At high nominal heating to cooling rate ratios, high micro-hardness values were recorded...|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} vehicles had timber veneer interior finishes, and on {{the main}} line vehicles small plastic labels were fixed to the panels, giving the type of wood and its country of origin e.g. [...] "Crown Elm Great Britain"; [...] "Lacewood Great Britain", etc. In 1955, an order was placed for 14 vehicles, with manufacturers being invited to incorporate innovative features; perhaps the most striking of these prototypes, which were completed in 1957, were those constructed by Cravens. Following evaluation, and with the increasing influence of the British Transport Design Panel, Mark 1 vehicles built from the later 1950s onwards were to modified designs. Laminates were used instead of timber panelling, and in the very last of the Mark 1 hauled vehicles, fluorescent lighting was fitted instead of tungsten bulbs. An important variant on the Mark 1 design were the 44 Pullman vehicles built by Metropolitan-Cammell in 1960. A further change introduced in the late 1950s {{was the use of}} aluminium window frames instead of direct <b>glazing</b> into the <b>steel</b> panelling.|$|R
