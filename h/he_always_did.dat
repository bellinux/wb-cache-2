5|$|By October 1943, the fractious {{relationship}} came to {{the surface}} again. Galland met with Göring at Göring's estate, Schloss Veldenstein. During the conversation {{the need for new}} and improved interceptor aircraft arose. The demands made by Göring, that heavily cannon-armed fighters be used in mass numbers to defeat bomber formations, were unreasonable to Galland. Göring, prompted by the desires of Hitler, wanted cannons of some 2,000 lb in weight which fired at a rate of one shell per second. Galland explained that such a weapon could not be used effectively in an aircraft; the cannon would be prone to jamming and the aircraft would be too difficult to manoeuvre. Galland also asserted the use of inappropriate weaponry such as the Messerschmitt Me 410, a favourite of Hitler's, had caused heavy losses. Galland argued such measures were deplorable and irresponsible. Göring ignored Galland's arguments and continued his frequent attacks on the fighter force, accusing them of cowardice. Galland, as <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> defended them, risking his career and, {{near the end of the}} war, his life in doing so. Galland stated that he could not agree to follow Göring's plans and requested to be dismissed from his post and sent back to his unit. Göring accepted, but two weeks later he apologised to Galland and attributed his behaviour to stress. Galland continued in his post.|$|E

25|$|Joel Godard, {{a long-time}} {{announcer}} for NBC shows, was the show's announcer {{and a frequent}} comedy contributor. These comedy bits usually revolved around Godard's supposed homosexual fetishes, deviant sexual habits, substance abuse, and suicidal tendencies. The humor came in part from Godard's delivery. No matter how depressing or deviant the topic being discussed was, <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> so in an exaggeratedly cheerful voice and with a huge smile plastered on his face. Several sketches ended with Godard apparently committing suicide in his announcer's booth.|$|E

Kuakini saw me and said to my grandmother to let the haole go and told us to [...] "hakaka" [...] (fight). She did and we fought. I beat him. Kuakini made fun of Kinau who was about six years old then.|$|E
500|$|Dyer's display against Holland {{brought about}} a contest with Les Darcy, the [...] "Maitland Wonder". After their first contest was delayed when Darcy was {{detained}} in quarantine in Sydney, a contest was arranged for Boxing Day at Baker's Stadium. At {{the start of the}} fight, Darcy weighed in at 11st 1lb, while Dyer's weight was not announced beforehand, but in the after-fight weighing, it was recorded as 10st 2lbs. Before the bout Dyer was sporting a black-eye sustained in sparring and his knee strapped, which <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> after his dislocating the knee in 1911. Darcy started the fight in a flurry in an attempt to finish the contest quickly, but after little gain both fighters settled into a more evenly paced bout. The contest went the distance and the referee gave the victory to Darcy, which was seen as a fair result.|$|E

500|$|On 6 January 1969, the band's {{third day}} at Twickenham Film Studios, in {{south-west}} London, an argument was captured on film where McCartney criticised Harrison's guitar {{playing on the}} song [...] "Two of Us". A resigned Harrison told him: [...] "I'll play {{what you want me}} to play, or I won't play at all if you don't want me to play." [...] With the sessions being recorded by film director Michael Lindsay-Hogg, tapes reveal Beatles associates Neil Aspinall and George Martin sympathising with Harrison's position, recognising that McCartney and Lennon [...] "don't offer him enough freedom within their compositions". Ringo Starr, who had quit the band briefly during the White Album sessions, partly as a result of McCartney's hectoring of his drumming, recalled of Harrison's refusal to be [...] "dominated" [...] by McCartney any longer: [...] "Paul [...] wanted to point out the solo to George, who would say, 'Look, I'm a guitarist. I'll play the solo.' And <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> he always played fine solos." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed critical reception. The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin {{found the}} episode less enjoyable than [...] "Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter". He explained {{that when he}} first learned that the show would tackle the Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien situation [...] "I {{felt a surge of}} excitement and optimism. I thought the writers would come up with a smart new angle to attack the imbroglio", but after the airing he noted the janitor plot only hampered the episode. Rabin, however, enjoyed Tracy's actions in the episode, commenting that it [...] "provided a showcase for some great Tracy Morgan non-sequiturs". Emily Exton of Entertainment Weekly also found [...] "Khonani" [...] the weaker of the two episodes, and also believed that the [...] "late-night jokes felt tired". Television columnist Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger disliked the episode, and as a result he noted in his recap that he would remove 30 Rock from the rotation of shows for which <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> detailed reviews. Willa Paskin of New York magazine wrote had the show make reference to the Leno and O'Brien debacle a few months ago [...] "this would have been a cutting-edge satire... Now, not so much." [...] Jason Hughes of TV Squad remarked that the writing in [...] "Khonani" [...] was sharp, though added that [...] "for some reason" [...] the episode [...] "didn't ring nearly as sharp or funny as many others. I think {{it was a lot of}} unfulfilled potential." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste magazine deemed this episode disappointing, but proclaimed [...] "it was still entertaining enough." ...|$|E
500|$|The basic {{story was}} {{conceived}} by Sakaguchi and Matsumoto, while the script {{was written by}} Sakaguchi, Masaru Hatano and Takatoshi Aoki. The story was contributed to by multiple staff members, which sometimes annoyed Sakaguchi when they suggested {{something that would be}} out of character for one of the cast. According to Sakaguchi, the initial version featuring a science fiction storyline was [...] "shot down" [...] by Nintendo, forcing the team to begin all over again with a new setting and characters. Despite the story still using science fiction elements, the team worked to distance the setting from those elements by focusing on bright, natural colors for the environments. The biographies of the main cast were put together during the story's creation. Originally, according to Hatano, the game's theme was to have been the [...] "all-important drama that takes place {{between a man and a}} woman", but as development progressed it was changed to a theme of general companionship, although the original story remained the same. Hatano suggested incorporating dialogue into the gameplay rather than restricting it to cutscenes. This approach was inspired by both Uncharted and television series The West Wing. The concept was initially put forward as a joke about Zael's habit of kicking doors open, and how his companions would comment on how <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> this. After receiving positive feedback, they implemented it and kept in Zael's behavior. Sakaguchi used this in-game dialogue to help convey the characters' personalities: as part of this, adlibs from the actors were included, and continual adjustments were made to the script. The characters' artwork also prompted Sakaguchi to make changes so the characters better fitted their presentation. The game's voiced dialogue was estimated at 12,000 lines. The option for players to skip through dialogue was a feature that Sakaguchi did not like, but he knew that some players would not like necessary long cutscenes, so gave them the option of going through them while still following the story. This meant that all the cutscenes needed to be done using the in-game engine rather than pre-rendered graphics.|$|E

Of his contemporaries, only Frank Chester stood in more first-class games with 774, though David Constant has since eclipsed Skelding in second place.

[...] Florence Nightingale reacted differently upon hearing of his death: [...] "He will be a great loss to us.

2500|$|Meanwhile, Olaf Rye {{had ordered}} 2 of his 5 battalions {{to bypass the}} Treldeskansen (the fifth redoubt) {{so that they could}} block Schleswig-Holsteinian {{reinforcements}} from reaching it, whilst the remaining battalions of his brigade attacked the redoubt, supported by the batteries 'Marcussen' and 'Meincke'. [...] Rye, wanting to move forward to observe the assault better, rode on a horse towards the redoubt. [...] Riding unescorted, his horse was killed, and he went by foot to the 'Marcussen' battery where he got another one. [...] Riding north of the Treldeskansen with a company from the 4th Reserve Battalion, his new horse was shot. [...] Around 03:00, as he was leading his men from the front as <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> he was shot in the thigh and in the lower abdomen, and died from his wounds a short time after.|$|E
2500|$|The {{passing of}} Bush removes {{one of the}} {{spectacular}} figures of Detroit baseball history[...] [...] [...] Built {{low to the ground}} and extremely aggressive, Bush presented a spectacle that appealed {{to the heart of the}} gallery. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> things in a sensational manner. His style made the hard ones look harder and the easy chances look hard[...] [...] [...] Of Bush's fielding the outstanding feature always was his throwing. In that, more than in anything else, Bush stood apart. He had an uncanny ability to judge the speed of a runner on his way to first. He never seemed to hurry a throw, and he seemed never to throw with speed. Most of the time he apparently lobbed the ball but he always got his man, sometimes by a fraction of a step -- but he got him. This ability of Bush's was always a matter of amazement to spectators and they could never solve the riddle of it.|$|E
2500|$|The Beauty Stone premiered at the Savoy Theatre on 28 May 1898. [...] Sullivan {{conducted}} the premiere, as <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> with his operas. [...] It closed on 16 July 1898 after {{a run of}} just 50 performances, making it the least successful of Sullivan's operas. [...] In contrast, the most successful shows that opened in London in 1898 had far longer runs: The Belle of New York (697 performances); A Greek Slave (349 performances); and A Runaway Girl (593 performances). [...] The cast of The Beauty Stone included Savoy regulars Walter Passmore, Rosina Brandram, Ruth Vincent, Emmie Owen and Henry Lytton. [...] Some of the music is more challenging than the typical Savoy Opera, and so Sullivan insisted on casting several opera singers, including Covent Garden opera soprano Pauline Joran as Saida (at an increased salary), {{and the size of}} the chorus was increased. [...] Choreography was by John D'Auban. Costumes by Percy Anderson and sets by William Telbin, Jr. (d. 1931) were universally praised by the critics.|$|E

Alber, who helped to arrange a lecture tour of the United States, wrote in Volume 55 of The American Mercury (1942) that [...] "Churchill struggled to express his feelings but his stutter caught him in the throat and his face turned purple" [...] and that [...] "born with a stutter and a lisp, both caused in large measure by a defect in his palate, Churchill was at first seriously hampered in his public speaking.

[...] On the way home from England in 1902, Australia stopped off at the Cape and played half-a-dozen matches during October and November. [...] Rowe was selected for one of the three Test matches but did little of note in a drawn game played at Johannesburg. [...] His best innings analysis was 8 for 25 (11 for 50 in the match) claimed at the expense of South-West Districts at Mossel Bay in 1904/05. [...] And his best match figures were 13 for 155 against Cambridge University at Fenner's on the 1901 tour.
