We develop a simple two-country model featuring an international bond market and enforcement constraints within both countries in an attempt to quantify the role of productivity and nancial shocks. We construct time series of productivity shocks and nancial shocks using the US and Japanese quarterly data since 2001 and conduct simultaneous replication on major indicators of real variables and aggregate nancial ows. The main results were as follows. First, for both the US and Japan, productivity shocks account for most real variable dynamics such as output and investment, while nancial shocks well capture the trend of consumption, current account, and labor trends in the US and succeed in replicating Japan's <b>debt</b> <b>repurchase</b> behavior. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that nancial shocks served as key factors in accounting for the observed troughs of output, labor, and consumption, as well as the peaks of <b>debt</b> <b>repurchase</b> and the US current account during the 2007 - 09 nancial crisis.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we build a {{theoretical}} model of corporate <b>debt</b> <b>repurchases.</b> First, {{we find that}} the firm that buys back its own debt from a creditor must pay a premium over the price at which the same creditor is willing to trade with third parties. This is because the repurchase by a firm leads to a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the amount of cash or assets available to pay the remaining <b>debt.</b> Second, the <b>repurchase</b> price is lower when there are multiple bondholders because of cross-creditor externalities.

Its {{mission is}} to contribute to Third World development while avoiding creating the dependency associated with traditional aid systems. Support in locating funding sources is thus directed at developing economic activity {{and the creation of}} businesses and employment. Farmers' associations, women's groups, traditional fishermen and tradesmen in the informal sector, and small business organizations in developing countries have benefited from the support of RAFAD. Its activities fall into four programme areas: · access to bank credit through a system of guarantees for development groups engaged in economic activities; · a network of support for organizational matters, management and monitoring; · the search for new ways of funding; and · dissemination of techniques used in the North in order to find systems of aid outside the current system which results in too much dependence. The Foundation has already provided the equivalent of 200 years of bank guarantees for loans ranging from US$ 10, 000 to US$ 150, 000, to development groups or associations in 22 countries. In turn these have been able to provide credit to several thousand businessmen or small farmers. The average repayment of these loans has been 97. 2 %. RAFAD also helps to create development funding by contributing an equal amount to <b>debt</b> <b>repurchase</b> by donors in the North. Such a fund, equivalent to 700, 000 Swiss francs, was made available to the Madagascar Business Promotion Enterprise (APEM; Association pour la promotion de ['enterprise a Madagascar) as counterpart to a <b>debt</b> <b>repurchase</b> with a gig of 350, 000 Swiss francs from the Canton of Geneva.

40|$|There {{is always}} some price that is low {{enough so that}} a debtor country gains by buying back some of its debts. Similarly, there is always some price that is high enough so that {{creditors}} gain by selling their debt claims. What is needed is a mechanism that allows trades to take place at some price within this range. One mechanism, the market buyback, {{has been called a}} boondoggle. However, market buybacks are too expensive from the debtor's point of view and faced with a buyback bid, each creditor has incentives to hold onto its claim unless the bid is larger than the value of debt after the deal. Concerted debt-reduction agreements can overcome this type of coordination failure, but they may be difficult to reach in practice because of the heterogeneity of creditors. The authors argue that the menu approach to debt reduction retains the advantages but not the inconvenience of buybacks and concerted agreements. They introduce a model of bank asset pricing in the presence of tax incentives and deposit insurance. They then derive the equilibrium level of exit and new money for a distributionof creditors facing a given menu program. They show that the optimal menu includes some positive level of <b>debt</b> <b>repurchase</b> in almost all cases - challenging the argument that buybacks are undesirable.

40|$|The {{presence}} of risky debt in a firm’s capital structure {{can lead to}} inefficient investment decisions when managers act {{in the interest of}} shareholders. Based on this agency cost perspective, I describe the market for debt repurchases and examine whether <b>debt</b> <b>repurchase</b> activity is consistent with a firm’s desire to mitigate debt overhang. I present an agency model of debt which demonstrates that when a firm faces a debt overhang problem, the value of a reduction in debt can outweigh the cost of the repurchase and increase the welfare of both stockholders and bondholders. Using a sample of debt repurchases initiated by U. S. firms over the period 1996 to 2004, I find evidence consistent with the agency cost model of corporate debt policy. Specifically, I find that firms are more likely to repurchase outstanding debt either by open market transactions or tender offers when potential transfers to bondholders are high. Employing a matching methodology based on propensity scores, I document significant increases in firm investment levels and efficiency for repurchasing firms relative to a control sample. This improvement is more pronounced for firms with higher expected transfers to bondholders (overhang). In addition, the efficiency improvements are concentrated in investment expenditures related to new investment projects, rather than in expenditures on maintaining existing assets. This finding is robust to corrections for selection bias and endogeneity, as well as various proxies for growth opportunities...|$|E
40|$|Previous studies {{indicate}} that debt buybacks at market prices benefit lenders the most because {{the lack of a}} seniority structure in sovereign lending distorts secondary market prices upward. The author examines whether welfare-improving buybacks would arise at the"fair"price. If so, policy intervention is needed to remove the distortion. In a model of intertemporal consumption smoothing, buybacks at the fair price are desirable if the country experiences unusually heavy export earnings and if large reserve holdings tend to increase transfers to creditors in default states. Concerted agreements in which <b>debt</b> <b>repurchases</b> are linked to cuts in interest rates or new money requirements can make buybacks at the fair price viable, while preventing the free-rider problem among lenders.

Additionally it is shown that if there are other assets safer than investment, a debt buyback will always lead to an increase in investment and a reduction in the holdings of such other assets. This result holds independently of the source of the resources used for the buyback, unlike previous suggestions. With a buyback out of current resources, optimal reserves levels fall by more than what is used for the buyback, releasing extra resources for investment purposes, while current consumption does not fall.

5000|$|The {{two main}} capital {{structure}} theories as taught in corporate finance textbooks are the Pecking order {{theory and the}} Trade-off theory. The two theories make some contradicting predictions and for example Fama and French conclude: [...] "In sum, we identify one scar on the tradeoff model (the negative relation between leverage and profitability), one deep wound on the pecking order (the large equity issues of small low-leverage growth firms)...". The capital structure substitution theory {{has the potential to}} close these gaps. It predicts a negative relation between leverage and valuation (=reverse of earnings yield) which in turn can be linked to profitability. But it also predicts that high valued small growth firms will avoid the use of debt as especially for these companies the cost of borrowing ('''') is higher than for large companies, which in turn has a negative effect on their EPS. This is consistent with the finding that [...] "…firms with higher current stock prices (relative to their past stock prices, book values or earnings) are more likely to issue equity rather than <b>debt</b> and <b>repurchase</b> <b>debt</b> rather than equity".|$|R

Financial sector vulnerabilities {{have increased in}} the face of rising interest rates and a slowing economy, but the overall banking sector remains resilient to moderate credit, interest, and depreciation risks. Improved budget execution could help cushion the downturn. Reducing delays in disbursing funds to executing agencies and better project implementation would help offset the expected decline in private consumption.

40|$|Over recent years, a {{substantial}} fraction of US convertible bond {{issues have been}} combined with a stock repurchase. This paper explores the motivations for these combined transactions. We argue that convertible <b>debt</b> issuers <b>repurchase</b> their stock to facilitate arbitrage-related short selling. In line with this prediction, we show that convertibles combined with a stock repurchase are associated with lower offering discounts, lower stock price pressure, higher expected hedging demand, and lower issue-date short selling than uncombined issues. We also find that convertible arbitrage strategies explain both the size and the speed of execution of the stock repurchases. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
