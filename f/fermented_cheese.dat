For the {{research}} the <b>fermented</b> <b>cheese</b> “Liliputas” was taken from UAB “Belvederio sūrinė” and the research {{was carried out}} in the laboratory of sensual analysis of the Nutrition Institute of Kaunas University of Technology. Project supervisor – Assoc. Prof. K. Pauliukas. Objective of the project is to adopt the production technology of the <b>fermented</b> <b>cheese</b> “Liliputas”, research the biochemical changes during the course of technological process, and determine the nutrition value. Research was carried out with the <b>fermented</b> <b>cheese</b> “Liliputas”, produced by UAB “Belvederio sūrinė”, by choosing the milk of the cowshed season and the milk of the pasturable season. Changes in the chemical composition and sensual indicators were researched in the laboratory of sensual analysis of the Nutrition Institute of Kaunas University of Technology. The following indicators were researched: pH, humidity (percentage), total nitrogen content (percentage), total protein content (percentage), total soluble nitrogen content (percentage), total soluble protein content (percentage), soluble non-protein nitrogen (percentage), free volatile fatty acids (VFA) NOOH ml, sensual properties (straw-color strength, elasticity when bending, solidity in mouth, viscosity (N), resiliency (mm), etc.). Maximum variation is observed with the free fatty acids when the cheese matures. Season did not have significant influence on the physical-chemical indicators. More intense straw-color strength as well as the smell of the <b>fermented</b> <b>cheese</b> is attributed to that cheese, which was produced during the pasturable season. Moreover, from the sensual properties we could observe that the cheese, produced during the pasturable season, was softer, more elastic, and a little bit more salty than the cheese, produced during the cowshed season. Cheese, produced during the pasturable season, was of the taste, more characteristic to the <b>fermented</b> <b>cheese.</b> After extra aging of the cheese, a slight difference according to the sensual indicators is observed {{under the influence of the}} season, however, it still remains. The most alterations of the indicators are observed during the periods of maturing. It is true to say that the most optimum period of maturing of the <b>fermented</b> <b>cheese</b> “Liliputas” is 2 months. Cheese, which has been matured for one month, is not mature enough. Whereas the maturing of the cheese for the period of 3 months did not have a major influence on the quality of the cheese...|$|E

Micrococcus lactis inhibited all the test organisms with zones of inhibition from 7. 0 - 24. 0 mm diameter, {{unlike the other}} isolates which inhibited few of the test organisms.

40|$|In this paper, the {{requirements}} for an automatic control strategy based on dissolved oxygen (DO) were studied for the case of fed-batch production of PHA by a mixed culture. The DO signal could successfully be used to control the pulse feeding in the fed batch when the threshold DO level for a substrate pulse was defined as relative to the monitored DO decrease caused by addition of substrate. A maximum polymer content of 0. 56 g/g was reached in 6 hours and the polymer yield ranged from 0. 45 to 0. 75 g COD/g COD for <b>fermented</b> <b>cheese</b> whey as substrate. A risk with the <b>fermented</b> <b>cheese</b> whey substrate was too frequent feeding which led {{to high levels of}} substrate in the reactor and reduced yield due to cell growth. Inhibition of the biomass by the stored polymer was an important factor reducing the substrate and oxygen uptake rates {{during the course of a}} fed-batch experiment. Data indicated that the maximum polymer content in the biomass was between 0. 5 and 0. 6 g/g, and modelling of the system showed that product inhibition could explain the change in shape of the DO curve observed as the biomass became saturated with polymer in the fed-batch. It was also illustrated that polymer consumption may occur simultaneous to accumulation and that this will lead to a trade off solution between polymer yield and COD removal...|$|E

Thermogravimetric analysis of the extruded filaments showed that MMC PHBV with 11 % residues was less degraded than pure PHBV after the thermomechanical processing. Infrared spectroscopy indicated that residues rich in OH groups were volatilized during extrusion, thereby originating filaments that were less degraded than those produced with purified MMC PHBV. Residues had {{no impact on the}} semi crystalline properties of the filaments, but were responsible for their depressed mechanical properties, significant color deterioration upon processing and narrowed the processing operating window of MMC PHBV.

We report that a proprietary protein extract isolated from Roquefort cheese inhibits the propagation of C. pneumoniae in a human HL cell line in a dose-dependent manner, as revealed by the immunofluorescence analysis. These changes were accompanied by a significant reduction in the infective progeny formation over the protein extract range of 0. 12 – 0. 5 [*]μg/mL. Moreover, short term feeding of mice with Roquefort cheese (twice, 10 [*]mg per mouse with an interval of 24 hours) led to the inhibition of the migration of peritoneal leukocytes caused by intraperitoneal injection of E. coli lipopolysaccharide. These changes were complemented by a reduction in neutrophil count and a relative increase in peritoneal macrophages, suggesting that ingestion of Roquefort could promote regenerative processes at the site of inflammation.

Formation of toxic chlorine derivatives has raised concern restrictions to its use and alternatives with whey permeate as a disinfection agent has been attempted. The {{aim of this}} work was to evaluate the bio potential of <b>fermented</b> <b>cheese</b> whey, for use on disinfection of minimally processed lettuce organically grown. Assays were made with whey obtained from inoculated milk during cheese processing, fermented for 120 h at 37 C, after which, among other carbohydrates, lactic acid was measured by HPLC, giving average yields of 18 g L 1. The sanitizing effect of whey, undiluted, 75 and 50 % solutions, was compared with 110 ppm sodium hypochlorite, after rinsing. Aerobic Microorganisms (AM), Psychrotrophic Microorganisms (PM) and Enterobacteriaceae (ENT), were used as indicators for hygiene quality. For a level of significance of P < 0. 05, the hygiene quality standards of lettuce samples, were better using 75 % whey solution (AM 6. 62, PM 7. 48 cfu g 1), than using sodium hypochlorite (AM 7. 48, PM 8. 15 cfu g 1), for the 7 days of shelf life studied.
