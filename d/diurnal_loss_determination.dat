40|$|International audienceOnline <b>determination</b> {{of track}} <b>loss</b> {{in the absence}} of ground truth is an {{important}} and challenging problem in visual tracking systems. In this paper, we construct a novel track <b>loss</b> <b>determination</b> strategy using Template Inverse Matching (TIM). The idea of TIM is to inverse the common process of template tracking match. Ground truth is not required to be known. It is proved to be highly efficient and accurate, and is adaptive to all the visual tracking frameworks. The proposed strategy is justified in the theoretical framework of Stable Marriage (SM) problem. In this paper, we prove that the combination between the target position got from the TIM algorithm and the original one can meet the constraints of SM pairs and is irreplaceable when a correct tracking process is performed. This guarantees the stability of object tracking. Compariative experiments show high accuracy of the present method in determining track loss. The performance of tracking systems can be improved based on online track <b>loss</b> <b>determination...</b>|$|R

The data from the grid settlement vary a lot between different grid areas and within a certain network during the year. There has been doubt about the accuracy in determining these variations. Network calculations and simulations of a grid area at voltage levels of 10 kV and below were performed, using computer programmes. The available software {{turned out to be}} useful only to obtain yearly energy losses and only for one of the studied networks.

C. ramosissima and M. claussenii differed in their growth form and exhibited contrasting strategies of water transport. Maximum xylem hydraulic conductivity of C. ramosissima culms was 2 -fold higher than that of M. claussenii. C. ramosissima cavitated at relatively high water potentials (50 % loss of conductivity at ≥ 1 MPa), whereas M. claussenii was more drought tolerant (50 % loss at ≤ 3 MPa). Both species exhibited significant loss of hydraulic conductivity during the day, which was reversed overnight due to the generation of root pressure. The photosynthetic capacities of both bamboo species, estimated based on electron transport rates, were moderate, reflecting both the large amount of leaf area supported by culms and <b>diurnal</b> <b>loss</b> of hydraulic conductivity due to cavitation. Leaf hydraulic conductance was also relatively low for both species, congruent with their modest photosynthetic capacities.

Vulnerability curves were constructed by plotting {{the percentage of}} maximum conductivity versus leaf water potential (ψI) and fitting curves using a Weibull function. The ψI at which each clone lost 10, 50, and 80 % of maximum conductivity was determined. Maximum conductivity per unit of leaf width was positively associated with metaxylem vessel diameter. The commercial clone H 65 - 7052 exhibited the highest and the nondomesticated S. spontaneum exhibited the lowest conductivity. All four clones lost substantial conductivity at values of ψI less negative than − 1. 4 MPa, but H 65 - 7052 was able to maintain 50 % conductivity to lower ψI than the other clones. S. spontaneum sustained the most negative ψI (− 1. 99 MPa) before reaching the 80 % conductivity loss point. Clone H 69 - 8235 was consistently the most vulnerable to initial loss of conductivity.
