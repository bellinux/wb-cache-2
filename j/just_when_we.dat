60|$|CAMPBELL. Another failure, and <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> {{thought we}} were sure of you. I don't know what we shall do about you, Mr. Sawyer.|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes,” {{answered}} Dunston Porter. “Here is a time-table. That {{will show}} you the whole route and tell you <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> get to each place.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{tell you}} I {{was in my}} perfect senses,' {{returned}} Philip; 'there she was, <b>just</b> as <b>when</b> <b>we</b> left her. And, what was stranger still, she talked French.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Just</b> now, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> {{were talking}} of Abdul Said, I asked {{if you could}} do your duty when it was a matter that {{affected}} you, if it meant misery or happiness to you, I said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes! I woke to see {{her face}} over me, all bright in wavy hair <b>just</b> as <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were children, and she said, 'Bear! Bear! we are going together!' Then somehow she tried to help me to trust for Phyllis and Lily." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Too bad!" [...] said Dick, {{shaking his}} head gravely. [...] "And <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> felt sure old Crabtree wouldn't {{be able to give}} us any more trouble!" ...|$|E
60|$|It was <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> {{had given}} up all hope, and I must {{therefore}} say so. <b>Just</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> {{had given up}} all hope, then, I suddenly caught sight, a little way below us, of a strange, weird sort of glimmer flickering among {{the trees on the}} opposite bank. For an instant I thought of ghosts: it was such a shadowy, mysterious light. The next moment it flashed across me that it was our boat, and I sent up such a yell across the water that made the night seem to shake in its bed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, if that {{tiresome}} Aunt Amelia would {{but have}} had some consideration! To go {{out of town and}} leave Aunt Susan on our hands <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> always go home!" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was dark}} in the morning, when I got upon the coach at the inn door. The day was <b>just</b> {{breaking}} <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were about to start, and then, as I sat thinking of her, came struggling up the coach side, through the mingled day and night, Uriah's head.|$|R
60|$|It was <b>just</b> <b>when</b> I {{believed}} <b>we</b> {{were close}} upon {{the spot where}} the Avenger should be stopped, that Jerry came tip-toeing aft, waving his arms to attract our attention.|$|R
60|$|The sun was <b>just</b> setting <b>when</b> <b>we</b> rode over a low {{hill and}} saw a small village upon our right, and on our left a high black castle, which jutted out from amongst the pine-woods. A farmer with his cart was {{approaching}} us--a matted-haired, downcast fellow, in a sheepskin jacket.|$|R
6000|$|Many cried, [...] "Our hearts was {{set hard}} against him. O Lord, are you angry wi' your {{servants}} that you're taking him frae us <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> ken what he is?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She was {{off before}} him. Presently she exclaimed to Mr. Boltwood: [...] "You know--just occurs to me--it's rather curious that our young friend {{should be so}} {{coincidental}} as to come along <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> needed him." ...|$|E
60|$|KATHLEEN (entering disconsolate, though {{first at}} the summons). Oh dear, oh dear, what a day! Was ever {{anything}} so provoking! <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> wanted to crystallise ourselves;--and I'm sure it's going to rain all day long.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have been}} hearing how you got burnt," [...] he began. [...] "Your friend, Lord Oliphant, sent a letter about it by the skipper of his yacht. That stupid fellow, John, has been {{carrying}} it about ever since, and only remembered it <b>just</b> now, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were at breakfast. It was a plucky thing to do, lad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That'll give us time to {{get better}} acquainted, and if we all like one another <b>just</b> as well <b>when</b> <b>we</b> get back--well, we'll buy the best farm in the North Platte and--" ...|$|R
60|$|We were {{as good as}} our word, for it was <b>just</b> seven <b>when</b> <b>we</b> {{reached the}} Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining like {{burnished}} metal {{in the light of}} the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dey {{have done}} that, sar," [...] Jim, who was {{standing}} close to Reuben's elbow, put in. [...] "Jim saw smoke curl up {{from the top of}} de hill, <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> turned, when we lost the trail." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{run away}} from us <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> are {{beginning}} to feel the comfort of your being with us. There, he won't catch cold now;" [...] and so having thrown a rug over Dumpling's back, he followed Adela into the station.|$|E
6000|$|... "A man we {{all knew}} so well! And <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> had made up our minds to do {{everything}} for him. Do you know I'm not a bit surprised. I've felt before now as though I should like to have done it myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, well, never mind; we are {{not going}} to give any more dinners <b>just</b> yet; but <b>when</b> <b>we</b> do, have done with {{pinching}} and squeezing. Why, you don't look fit to be seen after it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A very rowy row. I don't {{mean about}} dollars, for you'll have to manage that <b>just</b> at first. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> have {{got into the}} running, I think I shall have {{something}} to say on that subject too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When we {{got back}} to New York there was General Rompiro waiting for us on the pier. He was dancing like a {{cinnamon}} bear, all impatient for the news, for Denver had <b>just</b> cabled him <b>when</b> <b>we</b> would arrive and nothing more.|$|R
6000|$|... "They are not {{as clear}} as one would wish, so father told me," [...] {{answered}} Dick. He gave a long sigh. [...] "Too bad! And <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> thought the Stanhopes and the Lanings could sit down and enjoy all that fortune." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is," [...] agreed Uncle John. [...] "Go {{back to the}} car now, {{and wait}} for us. Don't get impatient. We don't know <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> will join you, but it will be {{as soon as we can}} manage it. What is Mumbles doing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll count up. We {{must have}} come pretty near to what you predicted; but {{we would have done}} a great deal better if it hadn't been for the big row. That made us lose at least an hour, to say nothin' of havin' six canes broken <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> needed every one {{in order to make a}} good show." ...|$|E
5000|$|This <b>just</b> {{means that}} <b>when</b> <b>we</b> query for bit 0 we check the parity, {{and go to}} (1,0) if [...] is odd (which is an {{accepting}} state), else we reject. If we check a bit , we divide [...] by 2 and check bit [...]|$|R
60|$|Still, we {{continued}} to advance toward them until nightfall; and, all day long, the mountain tops presented strangely shifting shapes, as the road displayed them in different points of view. The beautiful day was <b>just</b> declining, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> came upon the Lago Maggiore, with its lovely islands. For however fanciful and fantastic the Isola Bella may be, and is, it still is beautiful. Anything springing out of that blue water, with that scenery around it, must be.|$|R
60|$|It was <b>just</b> twelve o'clock <b>when</b> <b>we</b> {{knocked at}} Ebenezer's front door. Just {{at the moment}} when I should have been {{abstracting}} the fifteen hundred dollars from the box under the tree, according to the original proposition, Bill was counting out two hundred and fifty dollars into Dorset's hand.|$|R
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> {{had given}} up all hope—yes, I know that is always the time that things do happen in novels and tales; but I can’t help it. I resolved, when I began to write this book, that I would be {{strictly}} truthful in all things; and so I will be, even if I have to employ hackneyed phrases for the purpose.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{asked if}} I {{was sure they}} were natives, and I counterfeited surprise, and said that {{certainly}} they were; for which lie Allah will, I trust, be merciful, since it was told to an enemy. I {{said that they had}} left me, <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> had passed the last village; and had turned off by the road to the right, saying they had many miles to go.|$|E
6000|$|... "Izz {{is about}} house as usual; but 'a do say 'a can guess how it {{happened}}; and {{she seems to}} be very low in mind about it, poor maid, as well she mid be. And so you see, sir, as all this happened <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> was packing your few traps and your Mis'ess's night-rail and dressing things into the cart, why, it belated me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shouldn't," [...] said Mr. Pett, {{with more}} {{decision}} than was his wont. [...] "You know what Ann {{is if you}} try to force her to do anything. She gets her ears back and won't budge. Her father is <b>just</b> the same. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> were boys together, sometimes--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whew! It beats hikin'," [...] Billy said. [...] "The day's young yet {{and when}} he drops us we'll be fresh for a few miles on our own. <b>Just</b> the same, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> get settled an' well off, I guess I'll stick by horses. They'll always be good enough for me." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{got out of}} bed {{directly}} (said the German courier) {{and began}} to get on my clothes, begging him not to be alarmed, and telling him that I would go myself to the doctor. I was <b>just</b> ready, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> heard a loud knocking and ringing at the street door. My room being an attic at the back, and Mr. James's being the second-floor room in the front, we went down to his room, and put up the window, to see what was the matter.|$|R
