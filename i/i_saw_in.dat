25|$|According to {{official}} directives concerning nourishment issued {{at the beginning}} of 1916, each week the prisoner was to have 600-1,000g of potatoes, 200-300g of vegetables at lunch, meat three times, fish twice and 150g of legumes. The reality could be far from what these menus prescribed. Not only was the food insufficient, it was often quite detrimental to health: “The other day <b>I</b> <b>saw,</b> <b>in</b> our kitchens, quarters of refrigerated beef of which the smell and greenish tint were so pronounced that our cooks refused to prepare them. The German head doctor, called to arbitrate, ordered them soaked in a solution of permanganate and, the day after the morrow, this meat, thus disinfected, decorated the ordinary one”.|$|E

That they were not the indigenous production of the region, I am firmly convinced. Indeed they seemed aware of their being interlopers, looking fairly ashamed, and always trying to hide themselves in some dark corner. It was plain enough they did not feel at home in the vale—that they wished themselves well out of it, and back to the ugly country from which they must have come.|$|E

500|$|The Herald re-emerged as a daily {{paper in}} March 1919. Under Lansbury's {{direction}} it maintained {{a strong and}} ultimately successful campaign against British intervention in the Russian Civil War. In February 1920 Lansbury [...] travelled to [...] Russia where he met Lenin and other Bolshevik leaders. He published an account: What <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> <b>in</b> Russia, but {{the impact of the}} visit was overshadowed by accusations that the Herald was being financed from Bolshevist sources, a charge vehemently denied by Lansbury: [...] "We have received no Bolshevist money, no Bolshevist paper, no Bolshevist bonds". Unknown to Lansbury, the allegations had some truth which, when exposed, caused him and the paper considerable embarrassment. By 1922 the Heralds financial problems had become such that it could no longer continue as a private venture financed by donations. Lansbury resigned the editorship and made the [...] paper over to the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress (TUC), although he continued to write for it and remained its titular general manager until 3 January 1925.|$|E
500|$|Bennet cut {{her hair}} for the season, {{in order to}} further her character's {{transformation}} to the Daisy Johnson / Quake of the comics, while not cutting her hair as short as her comic counterpart. Bennet stated, [...] "The comic book version of Daisy Johnson has very short, Miley Cyrus-esque hair. We wanted to stay true to the comic book character fans love; I wanted to please them but also make sure there was still some movement and length and sexiness in the hair." [...] Bennet also received a new costume for the season, along with Quake's signature gauntlets. On the costume, Foley said, [...] "It's about strength. She feels very empowered in it....I wanted to stay true to some of the designs <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> the comics. In the style lines, I wanted to pay {{a little bit of a}} tribute to [...] tactical ability from last season, but we also incorporated the Quake symbol into her gauntlets and on the back of her suit." [...] Legacy Effects created the gauntlets and utility belt, [...] "out of flexible materials painted to look like metal" [...] so as not to injure anyone during stunts.|$|E
500|$|Lawrence Morton, in a {{study of}} the origins of The Rite, records that in 1907–08 Stravinsky set to music two poems from Sergey Gorodetsky's {{collection}} Yar. Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is [...] "Yarila" [...] which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: [...] "The likeness is too close to be coincidental". Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music {{rather than the other way}} round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: [...] "One day , when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision... <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps".|$|E

500|$|On 1 December, Benfica won {{its first}} league match {{in their new}} stadium, beating Rio Ave by 2–0. After the match, Camacho defended his team to the press by saying [...] "Eusébio's team is gone." [...] A week later, the team {{defeated}} Paços de Ferreira away, with João Pereira scoring two goals. Because Porto had lost points, Benfica were now only six points {{from the top of}} the league. On the 13th, Benfica won their fifth match in a row, beating Braga at home. After the game, Camacho angrily refuted any idea that Benfica did not play accordingly to expectations: [...] "A poor performance? That's not what <b>I</b> <b>saw.</b> <b>In</b> football there are two teams. Everyone knows that, against Benfica, all teams give their best, and we suffer that in the first half, because Braga played like every other team here. It is like the story of the bottle, for the optimist it is half full; for the pessimist, it is half empty." [...] On the same day, they were drawn with Rosenborg in the upcoming round of the UEFA Cup. The following Wednesday, Benfica progressed through the fifth round of the Portuguese Cup, with Luisão scoring a single goal in an away win against Académica. The final game of the month came on the 21st, with a 3–0 win to Estrela da Amadora. Two goals within the first ten minutes allowed the team to comfortably manage the remaining time. Camacho later said that Benfica could have scored six or seven goals. This was the team's seventh win in a row, the longest streak of consecutive wins in Camacho's time at Benfica.|$|E
500|$|German {{attempts}} to breach the 9th Parachute battalions' positions {{did not end}} until 12 June, and Hill stated that the period 7–12 June were [...] "five of the toughest days fighting <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> five years of war." [...] It was during this period that Hill was awarded the first Bar to his Distinguished Service Order, after supervising an assault by 12th Parachute Battalion on the town of Breville; the town dominated a long ridge near the Allied bridgehead, from which the German 346th Infantry Division launched repeated attacks. From then on until mid-August the division remained in static positions, holding the left flank of the Allied bridgehead and conducting vigorous patrolling. Finally, on 7 August the division was ordered to prepare to move over to the offensive, and {{on the night of}} 16/17 August it began to advance against stiff German opposition, its ultimate objective being the mouth of the River Seine (see 6th Airborne Division advance to the River Seine). Hill's 3rd Parachute Brigade led the division's advance, being held up until nightfall at the village of Goustranville, but then securing several bridges and allowing the 5th Parachute Brigade to pass through its positions and continue the division's advance. The brigade remained around the Dives canal for several days, and then on 21 August it advanced towards Pont L'Eveque, but was stalled by German infantry and armour near Annebault until 8th Parachute Battalion secured the village. Fighting continued to be fierce, but by 24 August the entire division had advanced across the River Touques. After another three days of reorganising and patrolling, the division's time in Normandy came to an end; in nine days it had advanced 45 miles, captured [...] of occupied territory and taken prisoner over 1,000 German soldiers. Its casualties for the period were 4,457, of which 821 would be killed, 2,709 wounded and 927 missing. It was finally withdrawn from the frontline in the last days of August, and embarked for England at the beginning of September.|$|E
