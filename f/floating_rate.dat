25|$|The {{securities}} can {{be issued}} {{with either a}} fixed interest rate or a <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> under currency pegging system. Fixed rate ABS set the “coupon” (rate) {{at the time of}} issuance, in a fashion similar to corporate bonds and T-Bills. <b>Floating</b> <b>rate</b> securities may be backed by both amortizing and non-amortizing assets in the floating market. In contrast to fixed rate securities, the rates on “floaters” will periodically adjust up or down according to a designated index such as a U.S. Treasury rate, or, more typically, the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> usually reflects the movement in the index plus an additional fixed margin to cover the added risk.|$|E

25|$|Currency {{interest}} rate fluctuations: Like all fixed income securities, {{the prices of}} fixed rate ABS move in response to changes in {{interest rate}}s. Fluctuations in interest rates affect <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> ABS prices less than fixed rate securities, as the index against which the ABS rate adjusts will reflect interest rate changes in the economy. Furthermore, interest rate changes may affect the prepayment rates on underlying loans that back some types of ABS, which can affect yields.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the welfare properties of fixed and <b>floating</b> exchange <b>rate</b> regimes in a two-country, dynamic, infinite-horizon model with agents optimizing {{in an environment}} of uncertainty created by monetary shocks. The optimal exchange rate regime may depend on whether prices are set in the currency of producers or the currency of consumers. When prices are set in consumers' currency, the variance of home consumption is not influenced by foreign monetary variance under <b>floating</b> exchange <b>rates,</b> while there is transmission of foreign disturbances under <b>floating</b> <b>rates</b> if prices are set in producers' currencies, or under fixed exchange rates. An important feature of the model is the exchange rate regime affects not just the variance of consumption and output, but also their average levels. When prices are set in producer's currency, as in the traditional framework, we find that there is a trade-off between floating and fixed exchange rates. Exchange <b>rate</b> adjustment under <b>floating</b> <b>rates</b> allows for a lower variance of consumption, but exchange rate volatility itself leads to a lower average level of consumption. When prices are set in consumer's currency, <b>floating</b> exchange <b>rates</b> always dominate fixed exchange rates. ...|$|R

40|$|Although it {{is a very}} {{important}} economic issue, the currency convertibility {{has become one of the}} most neglected issues in the modern economic theory, particularly after the abolition of dollar convertibility into gold in 1971. Nowadays, it is said that the currency convertibility is a technique for exchange of one currency to other currencies at <b>floating</b> <b>rates</b> in the cross rates of exchange in the world and it is treated as a consequent solution into the evolution of currency convertibility. However, the facts are contrary to the treatment of such a kind. The exchange of one currency to other currencies at <b>floating</b> <b>rates</b> is a digression in the evolution of currency convertibility because its effects upon the rationality of the process of international division of labour have been corrected by this type of convertibility. This is a priority function within the original meaning of currency convertibility.
