50|$|In finance, a <b>debit</b> <b>spread,</b> a.k.a. net <b>debit</b> <b>spread,</b> {{results when}} an {{investor}} simultaneously buys an option {{with a higher}} premium and sells an option with a lower premium. The investor {{is said to be}} a net buyer and expects the premiums of the two options (the options spread) to widen.|$|E
50|$|A bearish <b>debit</b> <b>spread</b> can be {{constructed}} using puts. See bear put spread.|$|E
50|$|A bullish <b>debit</b> <b>spread</b> can be {{constructed}} using calls. See bull call spread.|$|E
50|$|Investors want <b>debit</b> <b>spreads</b> {{to widen}} for profit.|$|R
50|$|The maximum {{gain and}} loss {{potential}} {{are the same}} for call and put <b>debit</b> <b>spreads.</b> Note that net debit = difference in premiums.|$|R
50|$|If the {{premiums}} {{of the options}} sold is higher than {{the premiums}} of the options purchased, then a net credit is received when entering the spread. If the opposite is true, then a <b>debit</b> is taken. <b>Spreads</b> that are entered on a debit are known as <b>debit</b> <b>spreads</b> while those entered on a credit are known as credit spreads.|$|R
50|$|For example, {{investors can}} create several {{different}} positions simultaneously {{to compare the}} performance and payoff characteristics between multiple strategies. A textbook may state that writing a covered call is synthetically the same as writing a naked put, but in practice there are subtle differences. With a paper trading account, an investor can set up a bull credit spread and a bull <b>debit</b> <b>spread</b> simultaneously and watch how the payoff for each position changes as the market moves.|$|E
5000|$|In finance, {{a credit}} spread, or net credit spread, {{involves}} a purchase of one option and a sale of another {{option in the}} same class and expiration but different strike prices. Investors receive a net credit for entering the position, and want the spreads to narrow or expire for profit. In contrast, an investor would have to pay to enter a <b>debit</b> <b>spread.</b> In this context, [...] "to narrow" [...] means that the option sold by the trader is in the money at expiration, but by an amount that is less than the net premium received, in which event the trade is profitable but by less than the maximum that would be realized if both options of the spread were to expire worthless.|$|E
5000|$|The {{position}} is {{so named because}} of {{the shape of the}} profit/loss graph, which loosely resembles a large-bodied bird, such as a condor. In keeping with this analogy, traders often refer to the inner options collectively as the [...] "body" [...] and the outer options as the [...] "wings". The word iron in the name of this position indicates that, like an iron butterfly, this {{position is}} constructed using both calls and puts, by combining a bull put spread with a bear call spread. The combination of these two credit spreads makes the long iron condor (and the long iron butterfly) a credit spread, {{despite the fact that it}} is [...] "long." [...] This distinguishes the position from a plain Condor position (and the plain Butterfly), which would be constructed with all calls or all puts, by combining either a bull call spread with a bear call spread or a bull put spread with a bear put spread. Because the long, plain Condor (and Butterfly) combine a <b>debit</b> <b>spread</b> with a credit spread, that overall position is instead entered at a net debit (though usually small).|$|E
50|$|Peerform {{provides}} an online personal loan platform which {{acts as a}} marketplace between potential borrowers and investors who lend money. By matching borrowers with investors, Peerform offers its investors access to a personal loan asset class in a US market which {{is reported to have}} grown by 176.6% per year between 2008 and 2013. Peerform only accepts accredited investors under SEC Reg D Rule 506(c) or institutional investors to lend money on its platform. Borrowers are screened on a variety of factors so as to ascertain what Peerform defines as “creditworthiness”. Peerform accepts near-prime (see Subprime lending) and prime borrowers with Credit Scores as low as 600 (and above). Each borrower is presented a fixed APR (and fixed interest rate) with an equal repayment scheme that allows them to pay back the loan in automatic bank <b>debits</b> <b>spread</b> out over 3 years.|$|R
50|$|Often {{the call}} {{with the lower}} {{exercise}} price will be at-the-money while the call with the higher exercise price is out-of-the-money. Both calls must have the same underlying security and expiration month. If the bull call spread is done so that both the sold and bought calls expire on the same day, it is a vertical <b>debit</b> call <b>spread.</b>|$|R
50|$|In summary, it is {{important}} to remember that a long calendar spread is a neutral - and in some instances a directional - trading strategy that is used when a trader expects a gradual or sideways movement in the short term and has more direction bias over the life of the longer-dated option. This trade is constructed by selling a short-dated option and buying a longer-dated option, resulting in a net <b>debit.</b> This <b>spread</b> can be created with either calls or puts, and therefore can be a bullish or bearish strategy. The trader wants to see the short-dated option decay at a faster rate than the longer-dated option.|$|R
40|$|The Durbin Amendment is {{the first}} of the major {{provisions}} of the Dodd-Frank Act to have been implemented-but only after it withstood a constitutional challenge {{on the basis of the}} Takings Clause in the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Now that the Amendment has taken effect, this Article addresses the false economic logic that led to its passage and the dubious arguments used to sustain its constitutionality. On the first issue, the supporters of the Durbin Amendment denounced the highly effective debit card system as a form of cartelization of the industry, which yields excessive returns to banks while overcharging retailers high rates for low-cost services. That objection rests on three central fallacies. The first is that the industry is monopolistic, when in fact, there is extensive competition for customers at every level. The second is that this critique ignores the economics of two-sided markets, under which transfer payments from retailers to customers expands the universe of <b>debit</b> card customers, <b>spreading</b> around the cost of operating the system. The third is that the costs of providing debit card services are limited to the marginal costs of providing services, but this critique ignores the fixed costs necessary to put the system in place. The failure to realize that these fixed costs need protection against government expropriation is the central error of the Eighth Circuit, which falsely assumed that firms in competitive industries need less protection than regulated monopolies. The paradox is that this argument gets it exactly backwards. The justification for regulating natural monopolies is to imitate competitive rates to the extent possible. But that justification is singularly unavailable with the debit card industry, which the Eighth Circuit held lacked monopoly power. At this point, there is no justification for any rate regulation, given that the debit card companies are already at the competitive rate and cannot recoup all their losses-direct charges to their customers requires the loss of the efficiency gains that interchange fees are able to exploit to good effect in a two-sided economic market. Thus, the Durbin Amendment, because of paradoxical thinking, has resulted in unconstitutional regulatory takings of the debit card companies...|$|R
