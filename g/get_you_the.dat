Barrow told Huggins: [...] "You're the manager, and you'll not be second guessed by me. Your job is to win; mine is to <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> players you need to win."

500|$|Goodnight Vienna {{followed}} in 1974 {{and was also}} successful, reaching number eight in the US and number 30 in the UK. Featuring musical contributions from Lennon, Elton John and Harry Nilsson, the album included a cover of the Platters' [...] "Only You (And You Alone)", which peaked at number six in the US and number 28 in the UK, and Hoyt Axton's [...] "No No Song", which was a US number three and Starr's seventh consecutive top-ten hit. The John-written [...] "Snookeroo" [...] failed to chart in the UK, however, when issued there as the second single from the album. During this period Starr became romantically involved with Lynsey de Paul. He played tambourine on a song she wrote and produced for Vera Lynn, [...] "Don't You Remember When", and he inspired another De Paul song, [...] "If I Don't <b>Get</b> <b>You</b> <b>the</b> Next One Will", which she described as being about revenge after he missed a dinner appointment with her because he was asleep in his office.|$|E
2500|$|The studio {{brought in}} screenwriter W. D. Richter, a veteran script doctor (and {{director}} of The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai) to extensively rewrite the script, {{as he felt}} that the Wild West and fantasy elements didnâ€™t work together. The screenwriter modernized everything. Almost everything in the original script was discarded except for Lo Pan's story. Richter realized that [...] "what it needed wasn't a rewrite but a complete overhaul. It was a dreadful screenplay. This happens often when scripts are bought and there's no intention that the original writers will stay on". Richter used Rosemary's Baby as his template, presenting [...] "the foreground story in a familiar context [...] rather than San Francisco at the turn-of-the-century, which distances the audience immediately [...] and just have one simple remove, the world underground, you have a much better chance of making direct contact with the audience". He wrote his own draft in 10 weeks. Goldman contacted Richter and suggested that he should not work on the project. Richter told him, [...] "I'm sorry the studio doesn't want to go forward with you guys, but my turning it down is not going to <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> job. They'll just hire someone else".|$|E
