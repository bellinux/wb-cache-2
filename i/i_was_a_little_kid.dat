Nas, who was twenty years old when the album was released, focuses on depicting his own experiences, creating highly detailed first-person narratives that deconstruct the troubled life of an inner city teenager. One writer describes {{the theme of the}} album as a “tory of a gifted writer born into squalor, trying to claw {{his way out of the}} trap. It's somewhere between The Basketball Diaries and Native Son….” The narratives featured in Illmatic originate from Nas's own experiences as an adolescent growing up in Queensbridge, as the lyrics allude to the housing projects located in the Long Island City-section of Queens, New York. Nas said in an interview in 2001: “When I made Illmatic <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>kid</b> in Queensbridge trapped in the ghetto. My soul was trapped in Queensbridge projects.” In a 2012 interview, he explained his inspiration for exploring this subject matter: ...|$|E

In an {{interview}} with IGN, the actress elaborated on the recording process, specifically {{the fact that she}} was required to record the majority of the character's dialogue in isolation, saying, [...] "I just loved the story so much and identified so much with the character of Mulan it was easy for me.

I felt like <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>kid</b> again, being silly with an imaginary sword and riding on an imaginary horse and talking to an imaginary dragon. So it was a lot of fun for me." [...] In spite of the fact that, throughout the film, Mulan shares several intimate scenes with her guardian, a miniature Chinese dragon named Mushu who is voiced by American actor and comedian Eddie Murphy, Wen and her co-star never actually encountered each other while working on Mulan due to the fact that they recorded their respective dialogue at separate times in separate locations.|$|E
