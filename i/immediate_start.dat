500|$|Within Tuvalu it was {{difficult}} to assess damage done by Hina alone, after Cyclone Gavin impacted the area a week earlier. Storm surge and strong winds from both cyclones caused a severe amount of coastal erosion on all of the country’s nine atolls, with about 6.7% of land washed into the sea. Hina caused no significant damage on Walls Island, while it caused some damage to crops and destroyed parts of the road on Futuna Island. As Hina affected Tonga, there were no casualties reported as the system affected the island nation, however, Vaiola Hospital reported that they had treated a number of patients for injuries that were caused during the systems aftermath. One indirect death was also reported, after a person suffering a heart attack while evacuating from his home. The cyclone left extensive damage to utilities and agriculture on Tongatapu, where trees were uprooted and more than [...] of fruit and food crops were destroyed, mostly to banana and coconut trees. After the cyclone the Tongan Government requested and received emergency aid, from the governments of several countries including France, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and the United Kingdom.

2500|$|After {{the end of}} Gibbs' first tenure, the Redskins hired former Redskins player Richie Petitbon for the 1993 season.

Their sole bright spot that year came on October 9, 1994, linebacker Monte Coleman played in his 206th career game with the Redskins, which broke Art Monk's team record for games played (Coleman retired at season's end with 216 games played). They improved to 6–10 in 1995 where they were able to get a season sweep on the eventual Super Bowl XXX Champions the Dallas Cowboys. On March 13, 1996, Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke, Maryland Governor Parris Glendening, and Prince George's County Executive Wayne K. Curry signed a contract that paved the way for the <b>immediate</b> <b>start</b> of construction for the new home of the Redskins (now FedExField). The 1996 season saw Washington post their first winning record in 4 years by finishing 9–7. On December 22, 1996, the Redskins played their final game at Robert F.

40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} the article (may not be free). New {{data suggest that the}} global {{incidence}} of several types of fungal diseases have traditionally been under- documented. Of these, mortality caused by invasive fungal infections remains disturbingly high, equal to or exceeding deaths caused by drug-resistant tuberculosis and malaria. It is clear that basic research on new antifungal drugs, vaccines and diagnostic tools is needed. In this review, we focus upon antifungal drug discovery including in vitro assays, compound libraries and approaches to target identification. Genome mining has made it possible to identify fungal-specific targets; however, new compounds to these targets are apparently not in the antimicrobial pipeline. We suggest that 'repurposing' compounds (off patent) might be a more <b>immediate</b> <b>starting</b> point. Furthermore, we examine the dogma on antifungal discovery and suggest that a major thrust in technologies such as structural biology, homology modeling and virtual imaging is needed to drive discovery...|$|R
