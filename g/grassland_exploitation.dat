40|$|This thesis {{was focused}} on {{evaluate}} the effect of various permanent <b>grassland</b> <b>exploitation</b> on the biological characteristics and soil properties. Permanent grasslands are composite and varied community of legumes, grasses and many other forbs, which are {{an important component of}} agroecosystem. This thesis was carried out in 2013 on experimental grass field trial on Faculty of Agriculture, University of South Bohemia in the ČeskéBudějovice. The experimental variants was evaluated the effect of management by mowing, mulching, leaving fallow. Otherwise were also evaluated height stands,phenophases during harvesting, types of outgrowth, the amount of residual biomass and selected soil properties. The aim of the thesis was to evaluate the effect of different exploitation of grassland herbage on its characteristics and selected soil properties and design of appropriate methods of grassland management. Method of grassland management should be chosen with respect to the exploitationmethodsof permanent grassland. It is very important {{to take into account the}} altitude climatic and soil conditions and the type of vegetation. Finally, it must be taken of the used machinery. It was recommended evaluated grassland mowed 2 or 3 times a year along with fertilization by NPK as a suitable form of management...|$|E
40|$|Hunter±gatherer {{adaptations to}} moist {{tropical}} grasslands {{are not well}} known from either the ethno-graphic or the archaeological record. This is unfortunate as grassland adaptations are clearly signi®cant to human biological and behavioral evolution. The most effective strategy for remedying this problem is to develop models for <b>grassland</b> <b>exploitation</b> based on strong understandings of the ecological {{similarities and differences between}} cold, temperate, and tropical grasslands. Cold, temperate, and tropical grasslands are similar in that water and raw materials are often scarce and the most abundant large mammals are gregarious and mobile. Tropical grasslands differ from cold and temperate grasslands by having a greater diversity and biomass of edible above-ground plants and plants with underground storage organs, making carbohydrate availability greater and less seasonal. Large mobile mammals and resident large mammals are more diverse and have greater biomass in tropical grasslands. Overall, tropical grasslands are a richer and less seasonally punctuated environment than either cold or temperate grasslands. A comparison of ethnographic data regarding variation in foraging strategies in different cold, temperate, and tropical settings lead to the construction of three models for hunter±gatherer exploitation of tropical grasslands: a Generalized Grassland Model (no specialized tactical huntingÐconsidered the favored model given mod-ern African grassland conditions), a Seasonal Grassland Model (only seasonal use of specialized tactica...|$|E

Već nakon prve godine korištenja utvrđene su u florističkom satavu travnjaka sve značajke intenzivnog pašnjaka as. Lolio-Cynosuretum Tx. 37. Nakon šeste godine korištenja pašnjak je imao obilježje ekstenzivnog pašnjaka u kojem uočljivu grupaciju čine indikatori zakiseljavanja staništa, a od trava dominira Festuca rubra. Objašnjenje leži u povećanom opterećenju pašnjaka, koje je uslijedilo u toku četvrte godine korištenja, pa nadalje. As part of {{research}} into <b>grassland</b> <b>exploitation</b> system, an investigation testing-ground in Medvednica (30 km north of Zagreb) {{has been used}} for determining the influence of rotational grazing of sheep on botanical composition of grassland. The rational pasture-ground is located in a beech and fir forest zone (Fagetum croaticum abietetosum Ht) at the altitude of 610 — 665 m above the sea level. It has been established on a grass-plot which, systematically and typologically, belongs to ass. Arrhenatheretum medioeuropaeum. In addition to rotational grazing, the grass-plot has been regularly fertilized. After the first year of exploitation, in the floristic composition of the grass-plot there wore already determined all the features of an intensive pasture-ground of Lolio-Cynosuretum Tx. 37 type (characteristic species of ass. Lolio-Cynosuretum and alliance Cynosurion, along with species of classes Plantaginetea, Chenopodietea and Artemisietea). During the fourth year and later, the plot was subject to heavier grazing, which was reflected in the floristic composition of the pasture- ground. After the sixth year of exploitation, the pasture-ground acquired the features of an extensive pasture-ground, in which indicators of the habitat acidification formed a prominent group of plants, and the dominant species of grasses was Festuca rubra...|$|E
40|$|Zoige Marsh, {{located in}} the Northeastern Qianghai-Tibet Plateau, is the largest {{highland}} marsh in the world. The marsh {{is one of the}} hotspots for biodiversity, harboring many endemic and endangered species, including Grus nigricollis, the only plateau crane. Zoige Marsh has a large area of high-quality grasslands, serving as the fifth largest livestock base in China, and it is also the major water source to the headstream of the Yellow River. However, due to global warming and unwise use of the marsh resources, including ditching for <b>grassland</b> enlargement, peat <b>exploitation,</b> and livestock grazing, since the 1970 s, Zoige Marsh has suffered severe ecosystem degradations such as vegetation recessive succession, biodiversity loss, soil deterioration, and rodent disasters. It is therefore imperative to restore the damaged marsh. We propose in this paper that ecological engineering and livestock population control must be taken as measures for ecological restoration and biodiversity protection. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The soil-climatic {{conditions}} from Baia Depression – the hydrographical basin {{from the}} extra-Carpathian {{area of the}} Moldova River - have frequently determined the presence, under different forms, intensities and periods, of temporary water excess from soil. The underground drainage, {{as a measure of}} water excess control, with stagnant character, caused mainly by rainfall amounts registered for 1 - 5 consecutive days, was firstly arranged in pilot-experimental fields during 1972 - 1978. We followed the behaviour in exploitation of underground drainage technical solutions, as concerns the functional efficiency of the means of water excess removal and of the improved soil favourableness and/or suitability for crop growing. In order to assess the long-term effects of ameliorating works, applied in 1978 in the drainage field of Baia, on an area of 3. 50 ha, we have qualitatively classified and estimated the albic stagnic glossic Luvosoil (S. R. T. S. – 2003), improved and unimproved. Based on this study, we have estimated the present favourableness for crops of the improved soil, as compared to unimproved soil, used as natural <b>grassland,</b> after an <b>exploitation</b> cycle of 30 years (1978 - 2008) ...|$|R
40|$|As our {{appreciation}} of migratory birds and {{our understanding of}} {{their role in the}} natural world grows, it’s important to recognize the critical contributions of sportsmen to migratory bird conservation efforts. For more than 60 years, hunters have provided a steady stream of revenue to build the National Wildlife Refuge System, and to restore waterfowl habitat on millions of acres of public and private lands across the country. These habitat projects also benefit migratory songbirds and other wildlife. In the early 1930 s, the accumulated impacts of plundered forests, heedlessly plowed <b>grasslands,</b> and commercial <b>exploitation</b> of wildlife from {{the turn of the century}} were brought sharply into focus by the worst drought and the worst economic depression in America’s history. People realized something needed to be done. With a handful of farsighted conservationists leading the way, organized sportsmen were instrumental in the creation of two programs that changed the course of wildlife conservation. The Duck Stamp Program On March 16, 1934, Congress passed and President Roosevelt signed the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act. Popularly known as the Duck Stamp Act, it required all waterfowl hunters 16 years or older to buy a Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp annually. In the years since its enactment, the Federal Duck Stamp Program has generated more than $ 501 million that has been used to preserve nearly five million acres of waterfowl habitat in the United States. Many of the more than 500 national wildlife refuges have been paid for all or in part by Duck Stamp money. Waterfowl are not the only wildlife to benefit from Federal Duck Stamps. Numerous other birds, wildlife and plants have similarly prospered because of habitat protection made possible by the program. Further, an estimated one third of the nation’s endangered and threatened species find food or shelter in refuges preserved by Duck Stamp funds. Outdoor enthusiasts have gained places to hike, bird watch or merely visit. Moreover, the protected wetlands help dissipate storms, purify water supplies, store flood water and provide food for many migratory birds. In recent years, Duck Stamp sales to hunters have declined as the number of Americans who hunt has decreased. The proportion of Duck Stamps purchased by non-hunters, however, has increased nearly 360 percent. Non-hunters now account for 13. 4 percent of Duck Stamp sales, contributing millions of dollars to wetland restoration efforts...|$|R
