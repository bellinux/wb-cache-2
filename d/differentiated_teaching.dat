40|$|AbstractADHD is {{considered}} an impairing psychological disorder that predominantly affects children and is characterised by inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. This diagnosis has become controversal in literature do to the conceptual resistances expressed by clinicians and pediatricians in considering a simple list of behaviors as a psychological syndrome, in absence of physical test or single cause demonstrating it. They {{have to be considered}} implications linked to the overuse of the diagnostic label; within these, the risk (by teachers and school managers) of justifying and supporting interventions for <b>differentiating</b> <b>teaching</b> strategies and menaging difficult student-case, the financing of which would be impossible without diagnosis. As a result, a considerable amount of research has been completed in recent years to better understand the phenomenon. In the present paper features for and against the use of the diagnosis will be present and discuss apart from the critical analysis of different frameworks and by introducing a relational perspective deriving from the labeling theory and interactionism. Operational suggestions and strategies for teachers and families dealing with minors are also presented, both in schools and in clinical setting...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIt {{is obvious}} {{that in the last}} decades {{important}} efforts have been made to orientate the teaching-learning activities towards differentiation and individualization. Also, empiric researches have been carried out to prove the advantages of a differentiated and individualized education compared to the traditional education, which, in most of the cases, still remains a collective or frontal type of education. Approaches have been made for training the teachers who would possess the necessary skills for the good organization of the <b>differentiated</b> and individualized <b>teaching,</b> and great efforts have also been made for the learning institutions’ modernization and endowment, so that they would meet the demands required by the <b>differentiated</b> and individualized <b>teaching.</b> Despite all these advantages and positive followings attached to the <b>differentiated</b> and individualized <b>teaching,</b> we should not bet on a single card and consider that the efficiency of the whole instructive-educative process can be obtained only by the obsessive promotion of the debated modalities. Being aware of the risks of such one-dimensional approach, we will try to show in this paper how good results in mathematics learning can be obtained, if this subject benefits from a correct differentiation and individualization...|$|R

50|$|Mentiqa {{covers a}} concept of views on and {{experiences}} with education of highly gifted pupils in Denmark. It was founded by Pernille Buch-Rømer {{in the belief that}} schooling with like-minded children makes it possible for the highly gifted pupil to develop adequate social skills. Thus the main point of Mentiqa is to care for the well-being of its pupils, which is made possible through the acceptance of the highly gifted pupil's special behaviour and way of thinking. This means that concepts such as inclusiveness and <b>differentiated</b> <b>teaching</b> are defined through a fundamental idea that treating children equally is treating them differently.|$|E
50|$|If a {{child or}} young person has not made {{progress}} despite such <b>differentiated</b> <b>teaching</b> {{he or she would}} usually be supported by a staged method of support outlined in the 2001 SEN Revised Code of Practice. A meeting would usually be arranged between key school staff such as the child's class teacher and SENCo (special educational needs coordinator), parents and the child. Key learning objectives would be agreed and a plan made for the provision necessary to achieve these. The Code of Practice recommends an Individual Education Plan as a means of recording and reviewing this. That level of support is known as School Action and would usually result in additional support being made available for a child, such as a few hours working with an adult each week. If a child's needs are greater or (s)he has not made sufficient progress in response to a School Action level of support then a School Action Plus level may be appropriate. This is similar to School Action but usually includes a greater level of resource and additional advice from appropriate professionals from outside the school, such as an educational psychologist or speech and language therapist.|$|E

Besides examining the grammar, the teacher has to think really hard to guess the real meaning of the sentences or expressions that the students want to say. Therefore, in order to simplify the process of checking and grading, the writer has conducted a small research toward a Sakubun class. This research was directed to the 7 th semester Sakubun class using the Cognitive and the Constructivism theory. Those theories were implemented in four different media as part of the class course material.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} the ways that expert and novice English teachers <b>differentiate</b> their <b>teaching</b> for linguistically gifted students, and to see whether these methods used differ based on teaching experience. I chose this topic because in my bachelor’s thesis I studied how expert teachers <b>differentiate</b> their <b>teaching</b> for the linguistically gifted students, and later on became interested whether the means used differed based on the amount teaching experience. The study was conducted using qualitative methods. Five female English teachers with approximately 10 - 30 years of teaching experience were interviewed to gather the data to represent expert English teachers. Novice teachers were a group of four female English teachers with less than three years of teaching experience. When asked to define differentiation all of the teachers talked about teaching so that everyone can learn. Most of the expert teachers put an emphasis on differentiation for weaker pupils where as novice teachers discussed differentiation from both perspectives. The study showed that expert and novice teachers used several different methods to differentiate learning for their students. Most of them were similar but differences were present in the amount of authentic material, technology and pupil involvement used...|$|R

A possible solution to the given problems is the adoption of multicultural education to reform current practices. According to James A. Banks, a professor in education at the University of Washington, the integration of the five dimensions of multicultural education will help create an equal opportunity classroom and school for all students. The first dimension, content integration, brings authentic multicultural curriculum into the classroom. The second, the knowledge construction process, asks students to examine different perspectives and frames of reference.
