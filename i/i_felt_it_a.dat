60|$|I {{was not so}} easy now {{during any}} {{reference}} to the name but that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> relief when Richard, with an exclamation of surprise, hurried away to meet a stranger whom he first descried coming slowly towards us.|$|E

60|$|Yesterday morning I was so unwell that I {{wrote to}} Frank Beard, from whom I shall doubtless hear to-morrow. I mention it, only {{in case you}} should come in his way, for I know how perversely such things fall out. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> little more {{exertion}} to read afterwards, and I passed a sleepless night after that again; but otherwise I am in good force and spirits to-day. I may say, in the best force.|$|E
60|$|And then it came--the hint of easterly air. The mate noted it first. I saw him {{start and}} turn his cheek to the almost {{imperceptible}} draught. Then <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it.</b> <b>A</b> minute longer he waited, until assured, when, the dead carpenter forgotten, he burst out with {{orders to the}} wheel and the crew. And the men jumped, though in their weakness the climb aloft was slow and toilsome; and when the gaskets were off the topgallant-sails and the men on deck were hoisting yards and sheeting home, those aloft were loosing the royals.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think that}} I shall feel uneasy, Margaret; but I know that I can ill spare you. You {{have ever been}} at my side since we were married, save when, {{after the birth of}} Agnes and Charles, you were forced to stay in England when I came over here. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> dreary time then, and shall feel it so now; but I doubt not that all will go well with you, though {{it will be a very}} {{different}} life to that to which you have been accustomed." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{main object}} on my mind, I remember, {{when we got}} fairly on the road, was to appear as old as {{possible}} to the coachman, and to speak extremely gruff.

5000|$|In her liner notes, Bradfield writes [...] "The {{music on}} this record is all {{acoustic}} violin.

60|$|I {{really had}} not yet been able to make up my mind whether I liked Uriah or detested him; and I was very {{doubtful}} about it still, as I stood looking him in the face in the street.

60|$|I suppose you're {{right about}} Simon. But it is Symon {{throughout}} in that blessed little volume my father bought {{for me in}} Inverness {{in the year of}} grace '81, I believe - the trial of James Stewart, with the Jacobite pamphlet and the dying speech appended - out of which the whole of Davie has already been begotten, and which <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> kind of loyalty to follow. I really ought to have it bound in velvet and gold, if I had any gratitude! and the best of the lark is, that the name of David Balfour is not anywhere within the bounds of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{glad that}} {{we have got to}} these open declarations, for too much of my life hath been already wasted in {{unsettled}} gallanting, when sound wisdom, and the example of all around me, have shown that in order to become the father of a family, and to be esteemed for a substantial settler, I should have both cleared and wived some years ago. I wish to deal justly by all, and having given thee reason to think that the day might come when we should live together, as is fitting to people of our condition, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> duty to ask thee to share my chances; but now that thou dealest in impossibilities, it is needful to seek elsewhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never. Never have I heard {{whether she}} was {{delivered}} according to our prayer. I know not, I know not. Who shall say where the pathways lie? The poisonous will of the wicked is strong. It poisoned my life--it is slowly stifling this breath. Death delivered my mother, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> blessedness that I {{was alone in the}} winters of suffering. But what are the winters now?--they are far off"--here Mordecai again rested his hand on Deronda's arm, and looked at him with that joy of the hectic patient which pierces us to sadness--"there is nothing to wail in the withering of my body. The work will be the better done. Once I said the work of this beginning was mine, I am born to do it. Well, I shall do it. I shall live in you. I shall live in you." ...|$|E
60|$|Would he ask for items? <b>I</b> confess <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was <b>an</b> awkward moment. Charles, however, was {{too full}} of regrets to bother about the account.

5000|$|... "I {{heard about}} Martin having an {{agreement}} with Truro that if a League club came in for him, {{he was allowed to}} leave. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was <b>an</b> opportunity we couldn't miss because he's got experience, he's local, done the job before and fits the remit of a second-choice goalkeeper."

60|$|Rorie {{set out for}} {{the house}} in search of warmth and breakfast; but my uncle was bent upon {{examining}} the shores of Aros, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> part of duty to accompany him throughout. He was now docile and quiet, but tremulous and weak in mind and body; and it was with the eagerness of a child that he pursued his exploration. He climbed far down upon the rocks; on the beaches he pursued the retreating breakers. The merest broken plank or rag of cordage was a treasure in his eyes to be secured at the peril of his life. To see him, with weak and stumbling footsteps, expose himself to the pursuit of the surf, or the snares and pitfalls of the weedy rock, kept me in a perpetual terror. My arm was ready to support him, my hand clutched him by the skirt, I helped him to draw his pitiful discoveries {{beyond the reach of the}} returning wave; a nurse accompanying a child of seven would have had no different experience.|$|E
60|$|I suppose you're {{right about}} Simon.[69] But it is Symon {{throughout}} in that blessed little volume my father bought {{for me in}} Inverness {{in the year of}} grace '81, I believe--the trial of James Stewart, with the Jacobite pamphlet and the dying speech appended--out of which the whole of Davie has already been begotten, and which <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> kind of loyalty to follow. I really ought to have it bound in velvet and gold, if I had any gratitude! and the best of the lark is, that the name of David Balfour is not anywhere within the bounds of it. A pretty curious instance of the genesis of a book. I am delighted at your good word for David; I believe the two together make up much the best of my work and perhaps of what is in me. I am not ashamed of them, at least. There is one hitch; instead of three hours between the two parts, I fear there have passed three years over Davie's character; but do not tell anybody; see if they can find it out for themselves; and no doubt his experiences in Kidnapped would go far to form him. I would like a copy to go to G. Meredith.|$|E
60|$|I rose; I dressed {{myself with}} care: obliged to be plain--for I had no article of attire {{that was not}} made with extreme simplicity--I was still by nature solicitous to be neat. It was not my habit to be disregardful of {{appearance}} or careless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I ever wished to look as well as I could, and to please as much as my want of beauty would permit. I sometimes regretted that I was not handsomer; I sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry mouth; I desired to be tall, stately, and finely developed in figure; <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> misfortune that I was so little, so pale, and had features so irregular and so marked. And why had I these aspirations and these regrets? It {{would be difficult to}} say: I could not then distinctly say it to myself; yet I had a reason, and a logical, natural reason too. However, when I had brushed my hair very smooth, and put on my black frock--which, Quakerlike as it was, at least had the merit of fitting to a nicety--and adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I should do respectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my new pupil would not at least recoil from me with antipathy. Having opened my chamber window, and seen that I left all things straight and neat on the toilet table, I ventured forth.|$|E

Pounding over every blade of grass, competing {{as if he would}} rather die of exhaustion than lose, he inspired all around him. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was <b>an</b> honour to be associated with such a player."

5000|$|... “As it was {{the first}} Iranian sound film to be {{presented}} abroad <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> should present <b>a</b> bright picture of Iran... I have to admit that the film was a great boost for the nationalistic pride of expatriate Iranians.” ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{never liked}} anyone else's {{approach}} to Beckett. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was <b>a</b> little too easy; they were treating {{him as if}} he were an existentialist hero, rather than a tragic hero. And he's a word man, a fantastic word man. And <b>I</b> always <b>felt</b> that <b>I</b> was a note man. I think that's what brought me to him. A kind of shared longing: this saturated, unending longing that he has, and that I have." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> {{grace that}} at that instant the dim lights seemed to grow less, and finally to disappear--all save the tiny points that marked {{the outline of the}} great Cross high overhead. These only gave light enough to {{accentuate}} the gloom. The hand that held mine now released it, and with a sigh I realized that I was alone. After a few moments more of the groaning of the winch and clanking of the chain there was a sharp sound of stone meeting stone; then there was silence. I listened acutely, but could not hear near me the slightest sound. Even the cautious, restrained breathing around me, of which up to then I had been conscious, had ceased. Not knowing, in the helplessness of my ignorance, what I should do, I remained as I was, still and silent, for a time that seemed endless. At last, overcome by some emotion which I could not at the moment understand, I slowly sank to my knees and bowed my head. Covering my face with my hands, I tried to recall the prayers of my youth. It was not, I am certain, that fear in any form had come upon me, or that I hesitated or faltered in my intention. That much I know now; I knew it even then. It was, I believe, that the prolonged impressive gloom and mystery had at last touched me to the quick. The bending of the knees was but symbolical of the bowing of the spirit to a higher Power. When I had realized that much, I felt more content than I had done since I had entered the church, and with the renewed consciousness of courage, took my hands from my face, and lifted again my bowed head.|$|E
60|$|My strict integrity, economy, and {{rigorous}} business habits, {{here again}} came into play. I found myself driving a flourishing trade, and {{soon became a}} marked man upon 'Change. The truth is, I never dabbled in flashy matters, but jogged on {{in the good old}} sober routine of the calling--a calling in which I should, no doubt, have remained to the present hour, but for a little accident which happened to me in the prosecution of one of the usual business operations of the profession. Whenever a rich old hunks or prodigal heir or bankrupt corporation gets into the notion of putting up a palace, {{there is no such thing}} in the world as stopping either of them, and this every intelligent person knows. The fact in question is indeed the basis of the Eye-Sore trade. As soon, therefore, as a building-project is fairly afoot by one of these parties, we merchants secure a nice corner of the lot in contemplation, or a prime little situation just adjoining, or tight in front. This done, we wait until the palace is half-way up, and then we pay some tasty architect to run us up an ornamental mud hovel, right against it; or a Down-East or Dutch Pagoda, or a pig-sty, or an ingenious little bit of fancy work, either Esquimau, Kickapoo, or Hottentot. Of course we can't afford to take these structures down under a bonus of five hundred per cent upon the prime cost of our lot and plaster. Can we? I ask the question. I ask it of business men. It would be irrational to suppose that we can. And yet there was a rascally corporation which asked me to do this very thing--this very thing! I did not reply to their absurd proposition, of course; but <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> duty to go that same night, and lamp-black the whole of their palace. For this the unreasonable villains clapped me into jail; and the gentlemen of the Eye-Sore trade could not well avoid cutting my connection when I came out.|$|E
60|$|My guide {{proved a}} most decent, patient, and kindly person, and I {{hope it is}} no {{betrayal}} of confidence {{to say that he}} told me the men in these multitudinous shops work by the piece. The grinders furnish their grindstones and all their tools for making the knives; there is no dry grinding, such as used to fill the lungs of the grinders with deadly particles of steel and stone, and bring them to an early death; but sometimes a stone, which ordinarily lasts six months, will burst and drive the grinder through the roof. The blade-makers do their own forging and hammering, and it is from first to last apparently all hand-work. But it is head-work and heart-work too, and the men who wrought at it wrought with such intensity and constancy that they did not once look up or round where we paused to look on. I was made to know that trade was dull and work slack, and these fellows were lucky fellows to have anything to do. Still I did not envy them; and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> distinct relief to pass from their shops into the cool, dim crypt which was filled with tusks of ivory, in all sizes from those of the largest father elephant to those of the babes of the herd; these were milk-tusks, I suppose. They get dearer as the elephants get scarcer; and that must have been why I paid as much for a penknife in the glittering showroom as it would have cost me in New York, with the passage money and the duties added. Because of the price, perhaps, I did not think of buying the two-thousand-bladed penknife I saw there; but I could never have used all the blades, now that we no longer make quill pens. I looked fondly at the maker's name on the knife I did buy, and said that the table cutlery of a certain small household which set itself up forty years ago had borne the same: but the pleasant salesman did not seem to feel the pathos of the fact so much as I.|$|E

6000|$|... "A blessing? There {{have been}} times when <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> {{millstone}} hanged about my neck, and could have wished nothing so much as that I were thrown into the sea. Man, you don't know what a curse I have felt my money to be at such times. When I have given it away, as I have by millions at a time, I have never been sure that I was not doing more harm than good with it. I have hired men to seek out good objects for me, and I have tried my best to find for myself causes and institutions and persons who might be helped without hindering others as worthy, but sometimes it seems as if every dollar of my money carried a blight with it, and infected whoever touched it with a moral pestilence. It has reached a sum where the wildest profligate couldn't spend it, and it grows and grows. It's {{as if it were a}} rising flood that had touched my lips, and would go over my head before I could reach the shore. I believe I got it honestly, and I have tried to share it with those whose labor earned it for me. I have founded schools and hospitals and homes for old men and old women, and asylums for children, and the blind, and deaf, and dumb, and halt, and mad. Wherever I have found one of my old workmen in need, and I have looked personally into the matter, I have provided for him fully, short of pauperization. Where I have heard of some gifted youth, I have had him educated in the line of his gift. I have collected a gallery of works of art, and opened it on Sundays as well as week-days to the public free. If there is a story of famine, far or near, I send food by the shipload. If there is any great public calamity, my agents have instructions to come to the rescue without referring the case to me. But it is all useless! The money grows and grows, and I begin to feel that my efforts to employ it wisely and wholesomely are making me a public laughing-stock as well as an easy mark for every swindler with a job or a scheme." [...] He turned abruptly to me. [...] "But you must often have heard the same from my old friend Strange. We used to talk these things over together, when our money was not the heap that mine is now; and it seems to me I can hear his voice saying the very words I have been using." ...|$|E
