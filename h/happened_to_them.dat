5|$|The {{story of}} Corruption is set {{six months after}} the events of , and follows bounty hunter Samus Aran as she assists the Galactic Federation in its fight against the Space Pirates. While fending off a Space Pirate assault, Samus and her fellow bounty hunters are {{attacked}} by her doppelgänger, Dark Samus, who incapacitates them with a mutagenic material called Phazon. After losing contact with the other hunters, the Federation sends Samus on a mission to determine what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> During the course of the game, Samus works to prevent the Phazon from spreading from planet to planet while being slowly corrupted by the Phazon herself.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} was then {{appealed to the}} Court of Appeal and argued on 23 and 24 April. The Court of Appeal reversed the Divisional Court's decision. The court decided that the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920 had been implicitly repealed when the Irish Free State, an independent nation, came into existence. In addition it was not proper for the Home Secretary to order the detention and deportation of someone overseas, since they {{had no control over}} what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> It was completely appropriate to issue a writ of habeas corpus against the Home Secretary because, even though he did not physically have O'Brien, he was considered responsible for him. The Home Secretary was accordingly ordered to produce O'Brien before the court on 16 May.|$|E
50|$|Some {{researchers}} {{have claimed that}} people think good things are more likely <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> than <b>to</b> others, whereas bad events were less likely <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> than <b>to</b> others.But others {{have pointed out that}} prior work tended to examine good outcomes that <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> be common (such as owning one's own home) and bad outcomes that <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> be rare (such as being struck by lightning).Event frequency accounts for a proportion of prior findings of comparative optimism. People think common events (such as living past 70) are more likely <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> than <b>to</b> others, and rare events (such as living past 100) are less likely <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> than <b>to</b> others.|$|R
50|$|Another {{example of}} {{defensive}} attribution is optimism bias, {{in which people}} believe positive events <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> more often than to others and that negative events <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> less often than to others. Too much optimism leads people to ignore some warnings and precautions given <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> For example, smokers {{believe that they are}} less likely to get lung cancer than other smokers.|$|R

5|$|A {{few days}} after the arrests the solicitors for one of the {{deported}} men, Art O'Brien, got in contact with Sir Patrick Hastings KC, a Member of Parliament for the Labour Party and a noted barrister. On 23 March 1923 Hastings represented O'Brien in front of a Divisional Court consisting of Mr Justice Avory and Mr Justice Salter to apply for a writ of habeas corpus for O'Brien as a test case to allow the release of the others. The initial hearing did not go anywhere because Hastings was unable to provide an affidavit from O'Brien (who was in Mountjoy Prison), which was required for a writ of habeas corpus to be considered, {{but by the time the}} hearing was resumed on 10 April he had managed to obtain one. Hastings argued that because the Irish Free State was an independent nation the British laws governing it, such as the 1920 act, were effectively repealed. In addition the Home Secretary had no power to order an individual to be detained overseas because he had no control over what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> there.|$|E
5|$|Final Destination 3 was {{originally}} {{the last part}} of a trilogy and had been in development since the release of Final Destination 2. Jeffrey Reddick, creator of the franchise and one of the co-writers of the first two films, did not return for the third installment. According to director James Wong, unlike the second film, which was closely tied to the first, Final Destination 3 was envisioned as a stand-alone sequel featuring new characters from the beginning, stating:e really felt that the idea of Final Destination, or the fact that Death can visit you and you can cheat death, that that could happen to anyone. And so we wanted to divorce from the first film character wise. We didn't want to follow that same thread. Part of the difficulty in that is when a character understands what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> before; it's a whole different way in which they react to what's happening now. We felt the franchise could exist with a new group of people, instead of following those older characters all the way through. We wanted to see if this could work.|$|E
5|$|Latin American {{novels that}} explore {{political}} themes, but {{that do not}} centre upon the rule of a particular dictator, are informally classified as “not quite dictator novels”. For example, Libro de Manuel (A Manual for Manuel, 1973), by Julio Cortázar, is a postmodern novel about urban guerrillas and their revolutionary struggle, which asks the reader to examine the broader societal matters of language, sexuality, and the modes of interpretation. In the Time of the Butterflies (1994), by Julia Álvarez, {{tells the story of}} the Mirabal sisters, whom patriotism transformed from well-behaved Catholic débutantes to political dissenters against the thirty-year dictatorship of the Trujillo régime in the Dominican Republic. The novel sought to illuminate the officially-obscured-history of the deaths of the Mirabal sisters, not to determine what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> but to determine how the Mirabal sisters happened to the national politics of the Dominican Republic. In the mock-diary “Intimate Diary of Solitude” (third part of El imperio de los sueños 1988; Empire of Dreams, 1994), by Giannina Braschi, the protagonist is Mariquita Samper, the diarist who shoots the narrator of the Latin American Boom in revolt against his dictatorial control of the fictional narration. Moreover, in Braschi’s most recent work “United States of Banana” (2011), the Puerto Rican prisoner Segismundo overthrows his father, the King of the United States of Banana, who had imprisoned him for more than a hundred years in the dungeon of the Statue of Liberty, for the crime of having been born. The story of Distant Star (1996), by Roberto Bolaño, begins on 11 September 1973, with the coup d’état by General Augusto Pinochet against Salvador Allende, the President of Chile. The writer and professor of literature Raymond Leslie Williams describes the aforementioned novels as not-quite-dictator-novels, which are reminiscent of the genre for being “acutely and subtly political fiction” that addresses themes different from those of the dictator novel, which cannot be divorced from the politics of the stories, and so each “can be read as a meditation on the horror of absolute power”.|$|E

25|$|A 60-minute special titled The Winner's Story is {{broadcast}} {{each year}} over the festive period, featuring the winner of that year's X Factor. Cameras follow the winner from {{the announcement of the}} result through the lead-up to the Christmas number one. As from 2010, one week before each series due to start, there features a special called X Factor Rewind looking back at the previous year's contestants and what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> during The X Factor and what has <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> since the show ended. In Series 12, these programmes aired in late afternoon slots on weekends. They started two weeks before the show began, and finished the day the show started, {{for the first time on}} ITV.

25|$|Frequently, victims may not {{recognize}} what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> was rape. Some may remain in denial for years afterwards. Confusion {{over whether or}} not their experience constitutes rape is typical, especially for victims of psychologically coerced rape. Women may not identify their victimization as rape for many reasons such as feelings of shame, embarrassment, non-uniform legal definitions, reluctance to define the friend/partner as a rapist, or because they have internalized victim-blaming attitudes. The public perceives these behaviors as 'counterintuitive' and therefore, as evidence of a dishonest woman.|$|E

25|$|Three factors {{contributed to}} the {{disappearance}} of the Frisii from the northern Netherlands. First, according to the Panegyrici Latini (Manuscript VIII), the ancient Frisii were forced to resettle within Roman territory as laeti (i.e., Roman-era serfs) in c. 296. This is the last reference to the ancient Frisii in the historical record. What <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> however, is suggested in the archaeological record. The discovery of a type of earthenware unique to 4th-century Frisia, called terp Tritzum, shows that an unknown number of them were resettled in Flanders and Kent, likely as laeti under Roman coercion.|$|E
25|$|In {{their first}} {{morning at the}} brothel, {{photographs}} of Ruff-O'Herne {{and the others were}} taken and placed on the veranda which was used as a reception area for the Japanese personnel who would choose from these photographs. Over the following four months the girls were raped and beaten day and night, with those who became pregnant forced to have abortions. After four harrowing months, the girls were moved to a camp at Bogor, in West Java, where they were reunited with their families. This camp was exclusively for women who had been put into military brothels, and the Japanese warned the inmates that if anyone told what had <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> they and their family members would be killed. Several months later the O'Hernes were transferred to a camp at Batavia, which was liberated on August 15, 1945.|$|E

25|$|After his death, Paine's {{body was}} brought to New Rochelle, but the Quakers would not {{allow it to be}} buried in their {{graveyard}} as per his last will, so his remains were buried under a walnut tree on his farm. In 1819, the English agrarian radical journalist William Cobbett, who in 1793 had published a hostile continuation of Francis Oldys (George Chalmer)'s The Life of Thomas Paine, dug up his bones and transported them back to England with the intention to give Paine a heroic reburial on his native soil, but this never came to pass. The bones were still among Cobbett's effects when he died over twenty years later, but were later lost. There is no confirmed story about what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> after that, although various people have claimed throughout the years to own parts of Paine's remains, such as his skull and right hand.|$|E
25|$|After he {{attained}} arhatship, {{he began}} to think deeply of his parents, and wondered what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> He used his clairvoyance to see where they were reborn and found his father in the heavenly realms i.e. {{the realm of the}} gods. However, his mother had been reborn in a lower realm, known as Avīci, or the Realm of Hungry Ghosts. His mother took on the form of a hungry ghost (preta)– so called because it could not eat due to its highly thin and fragile throat in which no food could pass through, yet it was always hungry because it had a fat belly. His mother had been greedy with the money he left her. He had instructed her to kindly host any Buddhist monks that ever came her way, but instead she withheld her kindness and her money. It was for this reason she was reborn in the realm of hungry ghosts.|$|E
