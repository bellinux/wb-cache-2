5|$|With the {{accuracy}} of the timing systems, ties are rare. Ties between different athletes are resolved as follows: In determining whether there has been a tie in any round for a qualifying position for the next round based on time, a judge (called the chief photo finish judge) must consider the actual time recorded by the athletes to one thousandth of a second. If the judge decides {{that there has been a}} tie, the tying athletes must be placed in the next round or, if that is not practicable, lots must be drawn to determine who must be placed in the next round. In the case of a tie for first place in any final, the referee decides whether it is practicable to arrange for the athletes so tying to compete again. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>decides</b> it is not, the result stands. Ties in other placings remain.|$|E

25|$|Even {{though the}} {{students}} are enrolled into their respective faculties, they may still choose a lecture from another faculty. The lectures are divided into three categories, A (obligatory), which a student of a given field has to pass; B (facultatory), certain number of which a student has to pass in order to collect enough ECTS-credits; and C (facultatory) which a student may choose to appeal his interest in a different field. Therefore it is possible, for example, for a Law Faculty graduate to have strong knowledge of Biochemistry, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>decides</b> for the C lectures of Faculty of Science.|$|E

500|$|... "Northern Lites" [...] {{was written}} by singer Gruff Rhys about [...] "the weather", and was {{particularly}} inspired by coverage of the [...] "terrifying, worldwide, seven-year phenomenon" [...] of the west Pacific El Niño climate pattern on [...] "weather channels" [...] in 1998. The song's title refers to the Aurora Borealis, a natural light display which can be observed particularly in the polar regions, and usually at night. The band were convinced that they had seen the lights before the track was written but, as no-one else was present, they could not get confirmation that what they had witnessed {{was not simply a}} [...] "Furry fantasy". Rhys has claimed that he would have called the song [...] "Aurora Borealis" [...] but [...] "Latin song titles are out of the question". Although Rhys has said that the song is [...] "about asking Jesus <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>decides</b> to seek his revenge on us, {{to get it over with}} as soon as possible and blow us away to the Northern Lights" [...] he has also stated that, although some critics have interpreted the track as being about [...] "questioning one's faith", it is really [...] "just a song about the weather".|$|E

2500|$|The 2006 Eurovision Song Contest was a {{springboard}} for glib host roles, such as for The X Factor. Producer Giannis Latsios said that Rouvas' presence {{contributed significantly to the}} show's success, calling his first-season performance [...] "great" [...] and adding: [...] "We had a program {{that had to do with}} music and Sakis, on a collective level, is an icon that the generation which participates in this show has as an idol. He is a glowing character with much higher capabilities of expression and, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>decides</b> to continue this path, will improve. He has immediacy, critique and most of all he gave to a program a luster, which was not standard from the beginning." ...|$|E

In October 2011, Camoranesi made headlines for kicking an opponent in the head. In a match against Racing Club, Camoranesi fouled Patricio Toranzo and was shown a red card by the referee. Instead of walking off, Camoranesi ran back and kicked Toranzo in the head while Toranzo was still lying on the ground. Toranzo later commented that Camoranesi is [...] "not much of a man, just a coward" [...] and suggested Camoranesi would {{need to see a}} psychiatrist for his violent behaviour. Camoranesi faced a long ban from football for this incident.|$|E

2500|$|Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] ""Objects in the Mirror" [...] and [...] "Aquarium" [...] are {{surprisingly}} self-reflective, but the dumb-fun party jams are half as infectious as before, {{and twice as}} misogynistic." [...] Chayne Japal of Exclaim! stated, [...] "Mac Miller emphatically joins a higher tier of rap artists with Watching Movies, an effort that at once silences his detractors and rewards his faithful following." [...] Mike Madden of Consequence of Sound stated that, [...] "Watching Movies is Miller's most enduring, and endearing, project yet. I won't be worried <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>decides</b> to overhaul his sound again someday – I trust his artistic acumen now – {{but it would be}} nice to see him run with the aesthetic he found here." [...] Craig Jenkins of Pitchfork said, [...] "Watching Movies with the Sound Off is a quantum leap in artistry, but it's not without faults; the album's about three songs too long, and a couple of the tracks in the back end just plain run together." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later in {{the same}} book, an essay from Shakespeare critic Garret A. Sullivan Jr. {{describes}} {{the relationship between the}} speaker and the young man which is seen in sonnet four, saying [...] "The young man of the procreation sonnets, then, is the object of admonition; the poet (speaker) urgently seeks to make him change his ways, and, as we shall see does so in the intertwined names of beauty and memory and in the face of oblivion". Sonnet Four follows these very themes with the speaker praising his friend, the young man, for his beauty, he moves on to say that his friend not having children would be inexcusable, when he says [...] "Then how when nature calls thee to be gone: What acceptable audit canst though leave?" [...] (lines 11–12) Here the speaker is using the unpredictability of nature to try to convince his friend to hurry up and have children. He also tries to appeal to his friend's emotions by saying, [...] "For having traffic with thyself alone, / Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive" [...] (lines 9-10). The speaker is saying that is wrong and deceives the friend's own self <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>decides</b> to remain single and childless. Line 11 also contains a sexually suggestive play on words when the speaker says [...] "having traffic with thyself alone". The idea of being alone is used by the speaker as being the pathetic alternative to marrying and having a family.|$|E

5000|$|As an {{alternative}} to ordering jankers, the officer may alternatively decide to [...] "dismiss the charge", <b>if</b> <b>he</b> considered the man had no case to answer.

5000|$|In early 1934, Appleton legally {{changed his}} surname from [...] "Jablonowski" [...] to [...] "Appleton."

60|$|Duane worked half-way {{down to the}} level, and, well {{hidden in}} a niche, he settled himself to watch both trail and valley.

6000|$|Certainly {{there is}} no contending against the will of God; but still there is some {{difficulty}} in ascertaining and applying it to particular cases. For instance, we will suppose the Rev. Dr. Ross has a slave named Sambo, and the question is, [...] "Is it the will of God that Sambo shall remain a slave, or be set free?" [...] The Almighty gives no audible answer to the question, and his revelation, the Bible, gives none--or at most none but such as admits of a squabble as to its meaning; no one thinks of asking Sambo's opinion on it. So at last it comes to this, that Dr. Ross is to decide the question; and while he considers it, {{he sits in the}} shade, with gloves on his hands, and subsists on the bread that Sambo is earning in the burning sun. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>decides</b> that God wills Sambo to continue a slave, he thereby retains his own comfortable position; but <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>decides</b> that God wills Sambo to be free, he thereby has to walk out of the shade, throw off his gloves, and delve for his own bread. Will Dr. Ross be actuated by the perfect impartiality which has ever been considered most favourable to correct decisions? ...|$|E

6000|$|Scandalized voices murmur {{that these}} {{operations}} are unnecessary. They may be. It {{may also be}} necessary to hang a man or pull down a house.

But we do make the doctor the judge, and fine him anything from sixpence to several hundred guineas <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>decides</b> in our favor. I cannot knock my shins severely without forcing on some surgeon the difficult question, [...] "Could I not make a better use of a pocketful of guineas than this man is making of his leg?
