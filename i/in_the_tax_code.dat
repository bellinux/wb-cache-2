For example, the Regina Manifesto pledged the CCF to the eradication of capitalism; the Winnipeg Declaration recognized the utility of private ownership of business, and stated {{that the government should}} own business only when it was in the public interest. In its election campaign, the CCF did not promise to nationalize any industries. It promised changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>code</b> in order to increase the redistribution of wealth in Canada. It pledged to increase exemptions from income tax, to allow medical expenses to be considered deductions from income for tax purposes, and to eliminate sales tax on food, clothing, and other necessities of life. It also promised to raise taxes on the higher income brackets and to eliminate the favourable tax treatment of corporate dividends.|$|E

2500|$|According to William A. Niskanen, one of {{the architects}} of Reaganomics, [...] "Reagan {{delivered}} on each of his four major policy objectives, although not {{to the extent that}} he and his supporters had hoped", and notes that the most substantial change was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>code,</b> where the top marginal individual income tax rate fell from 70.1% to 28.4%, and there was a [...] "major reversal in the tax treatment of business income", with effect of [...] "reducing the tax bias among types of investment but increasing the average effective tax rate on new investment". Roger Porter, another architect of the program, acknowledges that the program was weakened by the many hands that changed the President's calculus, such as Congress. President Reagan raised taxes eleven times over the course of his presidency, all in the name of fiscal responsibility, but the overall tax burden went down during his presidency. According to Paul Krugman, [...] "Over all, the 1982 tax increase undid about a third of the 1981 cut; as a share of GDP, the increase was substantially larger than Mr. Clinton's 1993 tax increase." [...] According to historian and domestic policy adviser Bruce Bartlett, Reagan's tax increases over the course of his presidency took back half of the 1981 tax cut. Though since the Reagan tax reductions, top marginal tax rates have remained lower than at any point in US history since 1931, when the top marginal rate was raised from 25% to 63%.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} firms’ strategic responses to taxation and the welfare implications of changes <b>in</b> <b>tax</b> structure. <b>The</b> dissertation {{is comprised of}} three essays. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first essay, I use <b>the</b> <b>Tax</b> Reform Act of 1986 to investigate how firms adjust their tax strategies <b>in</b> response to <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> incentives induced by the reform. <b>The</b> results <b>in</b> essay one suggest that the 1986 reform created incentives for firms following a sustainable tax strategy to engage in more tax avoidance behavior. In essay two, I test {{for the presence of}} strategic cost shifting behavior by examining the distribution of taxable income around kinks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corporate <b>tax</b> <b>code.</b> Specifically, <b>the</b> McCrary’s (2008) density test, which was developed as a validity test in regression discontinuity design (RDD) is applied to a data set of US firms for the period 1988 - 2010. The results show that reported taxable income has a tendency to bunch at levels just under upward kinks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> marginal <b>tax</b> rate. Conversely, taxable income tends to exhibit gaps <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region below a downward kink in marginal tax rates. Both findings suggest that firms manipulate taxable income in response to kinks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corporate <b>tax</b> <b>code.</b> <b>In</b> essay three, I provide an explicit model that illustrates the incentives for strategic cost shifting behavior when <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>code</b> exhibits kinks. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> presence of upward kinks in marginal tax rates, profit maximizing firms will choose a path for investment that makes pre-profits bunch just below the kink point. I then use the model to quantify the welfare cost of kinks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> marginal <b>tax</b> rates. Additionally, I find that replacing a kinked <b>tax</b> <b>code</b> with one in which marginal tax rates rise smoothly retains <b>the</b> progressivity inherent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> current <b>tax</b> <b>code</b> while largely avoiding the welfare costs associated with large jumps in marginal tax rates.
