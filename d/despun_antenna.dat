50|$|Manufactured by Hughes Aircraft Company, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter {{was based}} on the HS-507 bus. The {{spacecraft}} was a flat cylinder, 2.5 m in diameter and 1.2 m long. All instruments and spacecraft subsystems were mounted on the forward end of the cylinder, except the magnetometer, which {{was at the end of}} a 4.7 m boom. A solar array extended around the circumference of the cylinder. A 1.09 m <b>despun</b> dish <b>antenna</b> provided S and X band communication with Earth. A Star-24 solid rocket motor was integrated into the spacecraft to provide the thrust to enter orbit around Venus.|$|R

40|$|A spin {{stabilized}} satellite has an electronically <b>despun</b> <b>antenna</b> array comprising {{a multiplicity of}} peripheral antenna elements. A high gain energy beam is established by connecting a suitable fraction or array of the elements in phase. The beam is steered or caused to scan by switching elements in sequence into {{one end of the}} array as elements {{at the other end of}} the array are switched out. The switching transients normally associated with such steering are avoided by an amplitude control system. Instead of abruptly switching from one element to the next, a fixed value of power is gradually transferred from the element at the trailing edge of the array to the element next to the leading edge...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} the information of the conceptual design of MINISTAR and presents the major {{features of this}} small spacecraft, able to support geostationary missions for satellite communications. MINISTAR is a sun pointing satellite, with <b>despun</b> <b>antenna</b> provided with momentum wheels to achieve gyroscopic stiffness along the pitch axis, maintained orthogonal to the geosynchronous orbit. Thrusters supply the attitude stabilization for yaw and roll axes and station keeping maneuvers. An unified propulsion system is adopted, with helium pressurized bipropellant. The system makes use of monomethyhl hydrazine as propellant and nitrogen tetroxide as oxidizer. Large autonomy {{is provided by the}} on-board system management. The communications 2 Ì† 7 payload power/mass ranges from 200 W/ 50 Kg to 600 W/ 100 Kg allowing payloads with volume of 0. 13 m 3 and a maximum antenna diameter of 1. 8 m.

40|$|It {{was shown}} earlier that 1 x 10 to the - 14 th Doppler data and 3 cm {{accuracy}} range measurements {{to a small}} Mercury Relativity Satellite in a polar orbit with four-hour period can give high-accuracy tests of gravitational theory. A particular conceptual design has been developed for such a satellite, which would take less than 10 percent of the approach mass for a possible future Mercury Orbiter Mission. The spacecraft {{is similar to the}} Pioneer Venus Orbiter, but scaled down by about a factor four in linear dimensions. A <b>despun</b> <b>antenna</b> 30 cm in diameter is used for tracking. The transmitted power is roughly 0. 2 watts at K-band and 0. 5 watts at X-band. The orbit parameters for individual eight-hour arcs and the gravity field of Mercury through degree and order 10 are determined mainly from the Doppler data. A 50 MHz K-band sidetone system provides the basic ranging accuracy. The spacecraft mass is 50 kg or less...|$|E
40|$|The Pioneer Venus Orbiter and Multiprobe {{spacecraft}} {{design and}} operation enabled both remote and in-situ {{measurements of the}} Venusian environment from the outermost fringes of the atmosphere {{all the way to}} the surface. Both spacecraft were spin-stabilized and solar-cell powered from launch to Venus. Since orbit insertion, the Orbiter has been transmitting measurements from a highly elliptical 24 -h orbit with periapsis altitudes down to about 150 km. Data rates up to 2048 bits/s have been utilized through a <b>despun</b> high-gain <b>antenna</b> transmitting at S-band frequency. Spacecraft attitudes, orbit periods, and periapsis altitudes are being maintained as required with a hydrazine propulsion system. The Multiprobe spacecraft (Bus with all four Probes attached) performed the necessary Probe checkouts and deployed the Probes to achieve the desired Probe and Bus targeting. Silver-zinc batteries provided the necessary power on each of the four Probes from separation from the Bus through the entry/descent sequence. Data rates of 256 and 128 bits/s on the Large Probe were maintained with 40 -W radiated power, and 64 and 16 bits/s on the Small Probes were maintained with 10 -W radiated power, through omni antennas directly to Earth-based stations. Each Probe's entry/descent sequence was controlled with a hardwired entry sequence programmer to achieve the desired scientific and spacecraft operations...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 15, 1981 / Bahia Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaThis space {{mission will}} {{investigate}} {{the structure of}} the comet by passing close to the nucleus. The spacecraft will first be injected into a geostationary transfer orbit where a perigee boost motor will deliver the kick necessary to encounter the comet post perihelion, as it passes through the ecliptic plane at a distance of 0. 98 AU from the earth. The spinning spacecraft and the use of a shield for protection from the dust present in the comet atmosphere dictate the use of a <b>despun</b> high gain <b>antenna</b> with inclined beam. The telemetry downlink at 40 KBps is in X Band and will be received on the Parkes (Australia) radio telescope which will be specially adapted for the task. The trade offs leading to the selected communications configuration are described along with the various spacecraft hardware items such as antennas, transponder, decoder and twta...|$|R
5000|$|The five {{satellites}} of the 1980s Leasat (Leased Satellite) program (Leasat F1 through Leasat F5) were alternatively named Syncom IV-1 to Syncom IV-5 {{and called}} HS 381 by the manufacturer. These satellites were considerably larger than Syncoms 1 to 3, weighing 1.3 tonnes each (over 7 tonnes with launch fuel). At 4.26 m, the satellites {{were the first}} to be designed for launch from the Space Shuttle payload bay, and were deployed like a Frisbee. The satellites are 30 rpm spin-stabilized with a <b>despun</b> communications and <b>antenna</b> section. They were made with a solid rocket motor for initial perigee burn and hydrazine propellant for station keeping and spin stabilization. The communications systems offers a wideband UHF channel (500 kHz bandwidth), six relay 25 kHz channels, and five narrowband 5 kHz channels. This is in addition to the fleet broadcast frequency, which is in the military's X-band. The system was used by military customers in the US and later in Australia. Most of the satellites were retired in the 1990s, but one would remain operational until 2015. During the First Gulf War, Leasat would be used for personal communications between Secretary of State James Baker and President George H. W. Bush, but was more typically used by [...] "mobile air, surface, subsurface, and fixed earth stations of the Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Army." ...|$|R
40|$|Four related {{tasks are}} {{discussed}} for data transmission from a probe prior to entering {{the atmosphere of}} Jupiter to an orbiting spacecraft in a trajectory past the planet: (1) link analysis and design; (2) system conceptual design; (3) Doppler measurement analysis; and (4) an electronically <b>despun</b> <b>antenna.</b> For tasks 1, 3, and 4, an analytical approach was developed and combined with computational capability available to produce quantitative results corresponding to requirements and constraints given by NASA, ARC. One constraint having {{a major impact on}} the numerical results of the link analysis was the assumption of a nonsteerable antenna on a spinning orbiter. Other constraints included the interplanetary trajectory and the approach trajectory. Because the Jupiter Orbiter Probe (JOP) program is currently in a state of evolution, all requirements and constraints applied during this study are subject to change. However, the relationships of parameters as developed will remain valid and will aid in planning Jupiter missions...|$|E
40|$|The {{separation}} and communications geometry analysis is presented {{which shows that}} it is possible to target a Jupiter entry probe from a Pioneer spin-stabilized vehicle to desired entry conditions and maintain a continuous line-of-sight communications link while the probe descends to a pressure of 10 bars within the atmosphere. Such a targeting is possible with either the deflected probe mode or with the deflected bus mode. For the nominal mission studied, an 800 day trip in 1978 with the Pioneer type spacecraft flying by a 1. 3 R(J), it was possible to achieve entries near zero angle of attack at about - 25 deg relative entry flight path angle. Because of the constraint on the deflection maneuver for the deflected probe mode, the deflection and phasing velocity requirements are much larger for this mode. The geometry parameters, look angles, ranges and range rates, provided by this analysis permit the design of a functional communications system for the bus and probe. Avoiding a high trapped radiation belt hazard at Jupiter by flying the bus by at 6 R(J), however, requires using a <b>despun</b> <b>antenna</b> on the flyby bus...|$|E
