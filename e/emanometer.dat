50|$|Guy Beckley Stearns (16 September 1870 - 1947) was an American {{physician}} {{specializing in}} homeopathy and the developer of autonomic reflex {{testing in the}} study of homeopathic preparations. He also was the founder of the Foundation for Homeopathic Research. Stearns conducted early research with very highly potentized remedies first with fruit flies and later with the <b>Emanometer,</b> a tuning device made by Dr. William E. Boyd of Glasgow, Scotland.|$|E
40|$|A {{study is}} made {{of the use of}} wire and nylon screens as a second filter in two radon or thoron detectors. It is shown that {{acceptable}} detection efficiency is obtained at flow rates comparable to those used in detectors in which other types of filter are used. The main advantage of the screens is their very low flow impedance. Several designs of detector which exploit this feature are discussed. Details are given of the performance of three prototypes: a 32 L radon detector with a limit of detection of 0. 0027 Bq m- 3 and power consumption of 25 watts; and a portable thoron <b>emanometer</b> capable of detecting fluxes as low as 1 m Bq m - 2 s- 1. The radon detectors are rugged and simple. They can operate with no routine maintenance and are suited to remote locations where only infrequent technical support is available...|$|E
40|$|Radon is an {{excellent}} tracer of other gases because it is unreactive and its short half-life (3. 8 days) prevents any significant build-up in the atmosphere over long time scales. The KNMI (Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute) Cabauw Experimental Site for Atmospheric Research with its 213 m meteorological tower has been a focus of experimental boundary layer research since the 1970 s. Over the years, the site has expanded the scope of its research applications to include land-atmosphere interactions. In 2006 and 2007, ANSTO designed and built two 1500 L detectors for 222 Rn radon observations which were installed on the Cabauw tower, drawing air from 200 m and 20 m AGL, respectively. These observations {{are an important part}} of a larger program to characterise regional emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, to evaluate the performance of climate and atmospheric transport models, and to quantify turbulent mixing processes in the lower atmosphere. Radon gas is emitted naturally from soils, where it is formed by radioactive transformation of 226 Ra radium as part of the decay chain of primordial 238 U uranium in the earth’s crust. The strength of radon emissions from the land surface into the atmosphere depends on the soil mineralogy and porosity, and to a lesser extent also varies with changes in atmospheric pressure and soil moisture. As the oceanic radon flux is effectively negligible (at least 100 times smaller than that from land), significant radon concentrations measured in air samples indicate that the air mass has been in contact with land within the previous few weeks. The use of radon as a tracer in atmospheric and climate research is limited by large uncertainties in the magnitude and distribution of the radon flux density over the Earth’s surface. Maps of radon emissions have previously been generated by assigning a constant value to large geographical areas (sometimes reducing at high latitudes according to known changes in snow and ice coverage), or from aerial surveys using terrestrial gamma radiation as a proxy. The only direct method of measuring radon exhalation from soil is by using an accumulation chamber. Such measurements are rare, and the new ANSTO designed and built radon <b>emanometer</b> has been uniquely designed with this purpose in mind. The ANSTO portable accumulation chamber allows radon to accumulate in a chamber placed over the soil. The evolution of the measured radon concentration within the chamber is continuously monitored, and the surface flux at that location can then be estimated after a given time period from the integrated measurements. Equipped with the ANSTO portable <b>emanometer,</b> a shovel, GPS locator, soil type maps of the area and the soil moisture probe, Sylvester Werczynski moved around the Cabauw tower on a three-wheeled pushbike that he hired locally. “The pushbike was actually the most practical means to access the various measurement locations, as the survey area consisted of a network of flat green polders with thousands of canals, windmills and farm houses - a typical country landscape in the Netherlands,” says Werczynski. - See more at: [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Radon {{is being}} {{measured}} continuously in spring water and soil-gas at Badshahi Thaul Campus, Tehri Garhwal in Himalayan region by using radon <b>Emanometer</b> since December 2002. An {{effort was made}} to correlate the variance of radon concentrations in spring water and soil-gas with meteorological parameters at the same location. The main meteorological parameters that affect the radon emanation from host material is surrounding temperature, barometric pressure, wind velocity, rain fall and water level of the spring. The correlation coefficient between radon concentration in spring water and different atmospheric parameters was computed. The correlation coefficient between radon concentration in spring water and the maximum atmospheric temperature was 0. 3, while it was 0. 4 for minimum atmospheric temperature at the monitoring site. The correlation coefficient for radon concentration in spring water with minimum and maximum relative humidity was 0. 4. Spring water radon concentration was found positively correlated (0. 6) with water discharge rate of the spring. A weak correlation (0. 09) was observed between the radon concentration in spring water and rain fall during the measurement period. As temperature of near surface soil increases, the radon emanation coefficient from the soil surface also increases. The possible effects due to global warming and other climatic changes on environment radiation level were also discussed in detail.

40|$|Systematic soil-gas {{surveys were}} carried out in Northamptonshire to {{investigate}} the distribution of radon and its controlling factors. This followed reports in 1988 of indoor radon levels in the county exceeding the Action Level of 200 Bq m- 3. Over 3300 observations were made using a soil-gas <b>emanometer</b> in traverses crossing all geological formations. Over each formation results {{were found to be}} log-normally distributed, falling within 95 % Confidence Limits. The results are compared with 1026 indoor measurements provided by local authorities. Direct comparisons cannot be made due to different controlling factors; the concentration of radon in soil-gas is determined by the permeability of the source rock and overlying soil and by climate and weather, particularly temperature and wind run. Indoor radon is also affected {{by the nature of the}} house construction, particularly the floor, and heating and ventilation. Both sets of observations show that radon occurrence is primarily controlled by the underlying geology; the relationship is presented as a Radon Hazard Map for Northamptonshire. The highest soil-gas radon levels occur over the Northampton Sand Formation where indoor levels reach 1600 Bq m- 3, clearly presenting an elevated health hazard. The Marlstone Rock Bed, Upper Lincolnshire Limestone and Glacial gravels are also an elevated hazard. Hazard groups are defined as elevated on permeable strata where soil-gas Rn- 222 is 11 Bq L- 1 or over; moderate where soil-gas Rn- 222 is 6 - 8 Bq L- 1 on permeable strata, or 11 Bq L- 1 or over on impermeable strata; slight where soil- gas Rn- 222 is 5 Bq L- 1 or less on permeable strata, or 6 - 8 Bq L- 1 on impermeable strata; and low on impermeable strata where soil-gas Rn- 222 is 5 Bq L- 1 or less. Indoor results were also used in defining the hazard groups. Of the formations designated as elevated, all extend into adjacent counties, where soil-gas radon surveys are strongly recommended...|$|E
