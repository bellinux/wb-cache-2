5|$|Concorde's {{drooping}} nose, {{developed by}} Marshall's of Cambridge at Cambridge Airport, enabled the aircraft to switch between being streamlined to reduce drag and achieve optimal aerodynamic efficiency without obstructing the pilot's view during taxi, take-off, and landing operations. Due {{to the high}} angle of attack, the long pointed nose obstructed the view and necessitated the capability to <b>droop.</b> The <b>droop</b> nose {{was accompanied by a}} moving visor that retracted into the nose prior to being lowered. When the nose was raised to horizontal, the visor would rise in front of the cockpit windscreen for aerodynamic streamlining.|$|E
5|$|In flight, the red-throated loon has a {{distinctive}} profile; its small feet do not project far past {{the end of}} its body, its head and neck <b>droop</b> below the horizontal (giving the flying bird a distinctly hunchbacked shape) and its thin wings are angled back. It has a quicker, deeper wingbeat than do other loons.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Moorefield was a cavalry {{battle in}} the American Civil War, which took place on August 7, 1864. The {{fighting}} occurred along the South Branch of the Potomac River, north of Moorefield, West Virginia, in Hardy County. The National Park Service groups this battle with Early's Washington Raid and operations against the B Railroad, {{and it was the}} last major {{battle in the}} region before General Philip Sheridan took command of Union troops in the Shenandoah Valley. This Union triumph was the third of three major victories (Battle of <b>Droop</b> Mountain, Battle of Rutherford's Farm, and the Battle of Moorefield) for Brigadier General William W. Averell, who performed best when operating on his own.|$|E

5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow breeds in sparsely vegetated scrubland. Males {{attract a}} mate by singing from regular {{positions}} {{at the edge of}} their territories throughout the breeding season. These birds are monogamous, taking only one mate at a time, and pairs often remain together for several years. If singing males come within contact of each other, they may initially raise their crowns and face the ground to display this feature; if that fails to make the other bird leave, they stiffen their body, <b>droop</b> their wings, raise their tails, and stick their head straight out. Males guard their territories year-round.|$|E

50|$|<b>Drooping</b> brome has {{demonstrated}} a {{quantitative and qualitative}} response to recent and near-term changes in the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Laboratory experiments have shown that above-ground biomass increased 1.5 - 2.7 gram per plant for every 10 part per million (ppm) increase above the 270 ppm pre-industrial baseline. On the qualitative side, rising carbon dioxide decreased the digestibility and potential decomposition of <b>drooping</b> brome. In addition to stimulation of biomass, rising carbon dioxide may also increase the above ground retention of <b>drooping</b> brome biomass by decreasing removal by animals or bacteria. Ongoing increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide may contribute significantly to <b>drooping</b> brome productivity and fuel load with subsequent effects on wildfire frequency and intensity.|$|R
40|$|Outlook for {{selection}} on increased photosynthetic {{productivity of}} winter rye plants is discussed. Donors of short-stem resistant to powdery mildew winter rye were bred with erect and <b>drooping</b> shape of leaf blade. In the erect form the apexes of leaf are oriented at the angle <b>drooping</b> form has 45 ° inrelation to the stem. Incomplete {{domination of the}} <b>drooping</b> leaf shape with ratio 1 : 2 : 1 is established. For the first time symbolic designation of dominating genes is offered with <b>drooping</b> leaf blade - StSt, with transitional heterozygote Stst with recessional heterozygote stst. Higher yield of grain in the comparative variety examination was proved to be received for the erect leaf form, which is predetermined by decrease of plant height, increase of kernel weight from ear, {{as well as of}} 100 kernels from plant and by quantity of redicles. <b>Drooping</b> leaf blade rye forms are also promising for selection on increased photosynthetic potential...|$|R

25|$|Band cups have {{a softer}} {{transition}} between {{the body and}} the rim. The decoration {{is in the form of}} a band circling the cup exterior and can frequently be a very elaborate frieze. In the case of this form the rim is coated with a glossy black slip. The interior retains the color of the clay, except for a black dot painted in the center. Variations include <b>Droop</b> cups and Kassel cups. <b>Droop</b> cups have black, concave lips and a high foot. As with classic band cups the rim is left black, but the area below it is decorated with ornaments like leaves, buds, palmettes, dots, nimbuses or animals on the cup exterior. Kassel cups are a small form, squatter than other Little Masters cups, and the entire exterior is decorated. As in the case of <b>Droop</b> cups, primarily ornaments are painted. Famous Little Masters are the potters Phrynos, Sokles, Tleson and Ergoteles, the latter two being sons of the potter Nearchos. Hermogenes invented a Little Master variety of skyphos now known as a Hermogenes skyphos. The Phrynos Painter, Taleides Painter, Xenokles Painter and the Group of Rhodes 12264 should also be mentioned here.|$|E

25|$|Droops {{function}} with other high-lift devices on an aircraft {{to increase the}} camber of the wing and reduce the stalling speed. On the Airbus A380, {{the first stage of}} lift device selection deploys the droops (called <b>droop</b> noses by Airbus) and leading-edge slats located further out on the wing; with the flaps starting to extend when the second stage is selected. The droops on the A380 may be deployed to a position 22 or 25 degrees lower than their stowed position. Another function of the droops on the A380 is to change the stall characteristics of the wing. The A380's designers found that the airflow between the engines was separating from the wing surface prior to the airflow between the engine and the fuselage, an undesirable characteristic. Adding a <b>droop</b> between the engine and the fuselage fixed the problem; whereas using a leading-edge slat would not have done so because of the gap (or slot) created between a slat and the wing when a slat is deployed.|$|E
