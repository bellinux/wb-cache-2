5|$|Toxemia of {{pregnancy}} is common and kills many pregnant females. Signs of toxemia include anorexia, lack of energy, excessive salivation, a sweet or fruity breath odor due to ketones, and seizures in advanced cases. Pregnancy toxemia {{appears to be}} most common in hot climates. Other serious complications {{of pregnancy}} can include a prolapsed uterus, <b>hypocalcaemia,</b> and mastitis.|$|E
5|$|Excess {{intake of}} calcium may cause hypercalcaemia, {{but because of}} the inefficient {{absorption}} of calcium by the intestines a more likely cause is excessive vitamin D intake or excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone. It can also occur due to the bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasise to bone. This results in deposition of calcium salts into the heart, the blood vessels, and the kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia may lead to soft tissue calcification, which can lead to serious consequences: for example, calcification of the vascular wall can lead to a loss of elasticity and the disruption of laminar blood flow, and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Likewise, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intake results in <b>hypocalcaemia,</b> often caused by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective receptors to it in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, potentially causing tetany and defects in cardiac conduction.|$|E
25|$|Electrolyte disturbance: Cisplatin {{can cause}} hypomagnesaemia, hypokalaemia and <b>hypocalcaemia.</b> The <b>hypocalcaemia</b> seems {{to occur in}} those with low serum {{magnesium}} secondary to cisplatin, {{so it is not}} primarily due to the cisplatin.|$|E
500|$|Almost all who undergo parathyroidectomy {{experience}} increased {{bone density}} and repair of the skeleton within weeks. Additionally, patients with OFC who have undergone parathyroidectomy begin to show regression of brown tumors within six months. [...] Following parathyroidectomy, <b>hypocalcaemia</b> is common. [...] This {{results from a}} combination of suppressed parathyroid glands due to prolonged hypercalcaemia, as well as the need for calcium and phosphate in the mineralization of new bone.|$|E

50|$|Total calcium of {{less than}} 8.0 mg/dL is <b>hypocalcaemia,</b> with levels below 1.59 mmol/L (6 mg/dL) {{generally}} fatal.|$|E
50|$|Hyperparathyroidism {{results in}} hypercalcaemia {{and its effects}} and in extreme bone wasting. Hypoparathyroidism leads to <b>hypocalcaemia,</b> {{evidenced}} by tetany seizure and respiratory paralysis.|$|E
5000|$|Ca2+calcium is a {{component}} of bones and teeth. It also functions as a biological messenger, as {{do most of the}} ions listed below. See <b>hypocalcaemia</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|Oral, {{perioral}} and acral paresthesias, tingling or 'pins and needles' {{sensation in}} and around the mouth and lips, and in the extremities of the hands and feet. This is often the earliest symptom of <b>hypocalcaemia.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{characteristics}} of the disease are the sudden onset of fever, stiffness, lameness and nasal and ocular discharges. BEF often causes <b>hypocalcaemia</b> which in turn generates clinical signs such as depression, cessation of rumination, muscle tremors and constipation.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to these key imbalances, vitamin D and calcium are also taken orally in case the alteration of vitamin D causes a severe <b>hypocalcaemia,</b> this treatment has the goal of restoring physiological levels of calcium in the patient.|$|E
50|$|Substantial {{decreases}} in extracellular Ca2+ ion concentrations {{may result in}} a condition known as hypocalcemic tetany, which is marked by spontaneous motor neuron discharge. In addition, severe <b>hypocalcaemia</b> will begin to affect aspects of blood coagulation and signal transduction.|$|E
50|$|Chronic {{exposure}} to this substance may have negative health consequences. According to its OSHA, IARC, and ACGIH ratings, Cadmium tetrafluoroborate {{is recognized as}} a carcinogenic substance. Further effects of chronic exposure may include <b>hypocalcaemia</b> and edemas of the respiratory system.|$|E
50|$|Calcium lactate is {{also used}} to treat <b>hypocalcaemia</b> (calcium deficiencies). It can be absorbed at various pHs, thus it {{does not need to be}} taken with food. However, in this use it has been found to be less {{convenient}} than calcium citrate.|$|E
5000|$|Jersey cattle have {{a greater}} {{tendency}} towards post-parturient <b>hypocalcaemia</b> (or [...] "milk fever") in dams, and tend to have frail calves that require more attentive management in cold weather than other dairy breeds due to their smaller body mass and greater relative surface area.|$|E
50|$|Causes of {{cramping}} include hyperflexion, hypoxia, {{exposure to}} large changes in temperature, dehydration, or low blood salt. Muscle cramps {{can also be}} a symptom or complication of pregnancy; kidney disease; thyroid disease; hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or <b>hypocalcaemia</b> (as conditions); restless legs syndrome; varicose veins; and multiple sclerosis.|$|E
50|$|Patients {{may present}} with {{features}} of <b>hypocalcaemia</b> including carpo-pedal muscular spasms, cramping, tetany, {{and if the}} calcium deficit is severe, generalized seizures. IQ is typically mildly depressed or unaffected. Additional characteristics include short stature, obesity, developmental delay, and calcification of the basal ganglia in the deep white matter of the brain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hypocalcaemia,</b> also spelled hypocalcemia, is low calcium {{levels in}} the blood serum. The normal range is 2.1-2.6 mmol/L (8.8-10.7 mg/dL, 4.3-5.2 mEq/L) with levels less than 2.1 mmol/L defined as hypocalcemia. Mildly low levels that develop slowly often have no {{symptoms}}. Otherwise symptoms may include numbness, muscle spasms, seizures, confusion, or cardiac arrest.|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} (in more than 10% of people) are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, muscle spasms, and <b>hypocalcaemia</b> (too low blood calcium levels). In {{clinical}} studies, the latter side effect was usually {{mild to moderate}} and without symptoms. An increase of the QT interval of more than 60 ms was detected in 1.2% of people receiving etelcalcetide.|$|E

50|$|At {{the time}} of diagnosis, further {{investigations}} may be performed to identify complications, such as iron deficiency (by full blood count and iron studies), folic acid and vitamin B12 deficiency and <b>hypocalcaemia</b> (low calcium levels, often due to decreased vitamin D levels). Thyroid function tests may be requested during blood tests to identify hypothyroidism, which {{is more common in}} people with coeliac disease.|$|E
5000|$|Syndrome of {{inappropriate}} secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) {{this is basically}} when the bodys level of the hormone, antidiuretic hormone, which regulates the conservation of water and the restriction of blood vessels, is elevated. This is potentially fatal as it can cause electrolyte abnormalities including hyponatraemia (low blood sodium), hypokalaemia (low blood potassium) and <b>hypocalcaemia</b> (low blood calcium) which can be life-threatening.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a genetic}} {{developmental}} disorder with clinical diversity characterized by hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness and renal disease. Patients usually present with <b>hypocalcaemia,</b> tetany, or afebrile convulsions at any age. Hearing loss is usually bilateral and may range from mild to profound impairment. Renal disease includes nephrotic syndrome, cystic kidney, renal dysplasia, hypoplasia or aplasia, pelvicalyceal deformity, vesicoureteral reflux, chronic kidney disease, hematuria, proteinuria and renal scarring.|$|E

50|$|There {{is a risk}} {{of severe}} renal impairment. Appropriate {{hydration}} is important prior to administration, as is adequate calcium and vitamin D intake prior to Aclasta therapy in patients with preexisting <b>hypocalcaemia,</b> and for ten days following Aclasta in patients with Paget's disease of the bone. Monitoring for other mineral metabolism disorders and the avoidance of invasive dental procedures for those who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw is recommended.|$|E
5000|$|... 10% calcium {{gluconate}} solution (given intravenously) is {{the form of}} calcium most widely used {{in the treatment of}} low blood calcium. This form of calcium is not as well absorbed as calcium lactate, and it only contains 0.93% (930 mg/dl) calcium ion (defined by 1 g weight solute dissolved in 100 ml solvent to make 1% solution w/v). Therefore, if the <b>hypocalcaemia</b> is acute and severe, calcium chloride is given instead.|$|E
5000|$|Hypocalcaemia: lack of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (the {{way that}} vitamin D {{is stored in}} the body). As vitamin D regulates the amount of calcium present in the blood a {{decrease}} in its concentration {{will lead to a}} decrease in blood calcium levels. It may be significant enough to cause tetany. <b>Hypocalcaemia</b> may be relative; calcium levels should be adjusted based on the albumin level and ionized calcium levels should be checked.|$|E
50|$|Hyperparathyroidism, the {{presence}} of excessive amounts of parathyroid hormone in the blood, occurs in two very distinct sets of circumstances. Primary hyperparathyroidism is due to autonomous, abnormal hypersecretion of PTH from the parathyroid gland, while secondary hyperparathyroidism is an appropriately high PTH level seen as a physiological response to <b>hypocalcaemia.</b> A low level of PTH in the blood is known as hypoparathyroidism and is most commonly due to damage to or removal of parathyroid glands during thyroid surgery.|$|E
50|$|Sunlight, {{especially}} ultraviolet light, lets {{human skin}} cells convert vitamin D from an inactive to active state. In {{the absence of}} vitamin D, dietary calcium is not properly absorbed, resulting in <b>hypocalcaemia,</b> leading to skeletal and dental deformities and neuromuscular symptoms, e.g. hyperexcitability. Foods that contain vitamin D include butter, eggs, fish liver oils, margarine, fortified milk and juice, portabella and shiitake mushrooms, and oily fishes such as tuna, herring, and salmon. A rare X-linked dominant form exists called vitamin D-resistant rickets or X-linked hypophosphatemia.|$|E
50|$|Side {{effects of}} the {{donation}} of platelets generally fall into three categories: blood pressure changes, problems with vein access, and {{effects of the}} anticoagulant on the donor's calcium level. Blood pressure changes can sometimes cause nausea, fatigue, and dizziness. Venous access problems can cause bruising, {{referred to as a}} hematoma. While donating, a supply of calcium antacid tablets is usually kept close by to replenish the calcium lost. Because the anticoagulant works by binding to the calcium in the blood, a donor's levels of calcium - and especially of active calcium ions - drop during the donation process. The lips may begin to tingle or there may be a metallic taste; since calcium enables the function of the nervous system, nerve-ending-dense areas (such as the lips) are susceptible, at least during the donation process. Unusually low calcium can cause more serious problems such as fainting, nerve irritation and short-duration tetany. Such an acute <b>hypocalcaemia</b> is usually due to low calcium levels prior to donation, aggravated by the anticoagulant. <b>Hypocalcaemia</b> can be curtailed by modestly increasing dietary calcium intake in the days prior to donation. Serious problems are extremely rare, but apheresis donors are typically not allowed to sleep during the long donation process {{so that they can be}} monitored.|$|E
50|$|Zoledronate {{is rapidly}} {{processed}} via the kidneys; consequently its {{administration is not}} recommended for patients with reduced renal function or kidney disease. Some cases of acute renal failure either requiring dialysis or having a fatal outcome following Reclast use {{have been reported to}} the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This assessment was confirmed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), whose Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) specified new contraindications for the medication on 15 December 2011, which include <b>hypocalcaemia</b> and severe renal impairment with a creatinine clearance of less than 35 ml/min.|$|E
5000|$|Electrolyte disturbance, {{particularly}} hypokalemia and <b>hypocalcaemia,</b> {{may cause}} cramping and muscle tetany. This disturbance {{can also be}} caused by the body sweating out large amounts of interstitial fluid, which is mostly water and salt (sodium chloride). As muscle cells contain more osmotically-active particles, the loss of osmotically-active sodium particles from muscle cells disturbs the osmotic balance and therefore shrinks muscle cells. This causes the calcium pump between the muscle sarcoplasm and sarcoplasmic reticulum to [...] "short circuit"; the calcium ions remain bound to the troponin, continuing muscle contraction.|$|E
