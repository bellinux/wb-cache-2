5|$|A {{critical}} {{aspect of}} successful decompression {{is that the}} <b>depth</b> <b>and</b> ascent rate of the diver must be monitored and sufficiently accurately controlled. Practical in-water decompression requires a reasonable tolerance for variation in <b>depth</b> <b>and</b> rate of ascent, but unless the decompression is being monitored in real time by a decompression computer, any deviations from the nominal profile will affect the risk. Several items of equipment are used to assist in facilitating accurate adherence to the planned profile, by allowing the diver to more easily control <b>depth</b> <b>and</b> ascent rate, or to transfer this control to specialist personnel at the surface.|$|E

5|$|Where {{the dive}} site and {{underwater}} topography permit, divers often prefer to descend to maximum <b>depth</b> <b>and</b> slowly ascend throughout the dive. A slow ascent, and therefore slow pressure reduction, {{is a good}} decompression practice. When using a dive computer this type of profile may not require additional decompression stops. Dive computers, unlike decompression tables, measure <b>depth</b> <b>and</b> time at short intervals during the dive and calculate the exact decompression indicated by the decompression model, which for a multilevel profile will be less than for the square profile with the same maximum <b>depth</b> <b>and</b> duration.|$|E

5|$|Contaminated {{breathing}} gas {{at depth}} can be fatal. Concentrations which are acceptable {{at the surface}} ambient pressure will be increased by the pressure of <b>depth</b> <b>and</b> may then exceed acceptable or tolerable limits. Common contaminants are: carbon monoxide - a by-product of combustion, carbon dioxide - a product of metabolism, and oil and lubricants from the compressor.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{which follows}} the {{procedure}} of relatively fast ascent interrupted by periods at constant depth {{is known as}} staged decompression. The ascent rate and the <b>depth</b> <b>and</b> duration of the stops are integral parts of the decompression process. The advantage of staged decompression {{is that it is}} far easier to monitor and control than continuous decompression.|$|E
5|$|Immersion {{in water}} and {{exposure}} to high ambient pressure have physiological effects that limit the depths and duration possible in ambient pressure diving. Humans are not physiologically and anatomically well adapted to the environmental conditions of diving, and various equipment has been developed to extend the <b>depth</b> <b>and</b> duration of human dives, and allow different types {{of work to be}} done.|$|E

After shapes estimation of gravity sources through support vector classifier (SVC) in our last research [Hekmatian et al. 2015], in this paper SVC is applied for estimating <b>depths</b> <b>and</b> dimensions of gravity sources. These estimations give us logical and complete initial guesses regarding shapes, <b>depths</b> <b>and</b> dimensions of gravity sources which are needed in more precise interpretations and inversions of gravity sources. Also for better application of SVC, we selected more proper features using the technique called feature selection (FS). In this paper, we trained SVC with 320 synthetic gravity profiles for estimation of dimensions <b>and</b> <b>depths</b> of gravity sources. We tested the trained SVC codes by about 200 other synthetic and some real gravity profiles.
