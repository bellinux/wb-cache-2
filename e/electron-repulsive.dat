40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that {{two-dimensional electron gas}} (2 DEG) recently observed at the (001) SrTiO 3 surface can be solely derived by oxygen vacancies introduced during ultrahigh vacuum annealing or through ultraviolet irradiation exposure. However, 2 DEG entirely due to defect formation may {{be at odds with}} the characteristics of high mobility and easy field-effect manipulation required for applications; to that aim, an intrinsic formation mechanism should be preferred. Using advanced ab initio simulations we give evidence that 2 DEG at the (001) SrTiO 3 surface may even result from purely intrinsic properties of the pristine surface, provided that the surface is SrO terminated. The key concept is that the SrO termination is electron-attractive as a consequence of both the surface-induced polarity and the specific electronic reconstruction, whereas the TiO 2 termination is <b>electron-repulsive.</b> It follows that in vacuum-cleaved samples where both terminations are present, 2 DEG can result from the structurally ordered superposition of the two kinds of domain, {{even in the absence of}} any extrinsic source. On the other hand, in etching-prepared single-terminated TiO 2 samples 2 DEG should be assumed as entirely derived by extrinsic factors...|$|E
40|$|The {{solar wind}} {{electric}} sail (E-sail) is a planned in-space propulsion device {{that uses the}} natural solar wind momentum flux for spacecraft propulsion {{with the help of}} long, charged, centrifugally stretched tethers. The problem of accurately predicting the E-sail thrust is still somewhat open, however, due to a possible electron population trapped by the tether. Here we develop a new type of particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation for predicting E-sail thrust. In the new simulation, electrons are modelled as a fluid, hence resembling hybrid simulation, but in contrast to normal hybrid simulation, the Poisson equation is used as in normal PIC to calculate the self-consistent electrostatic field. For <b>electron-repulsive</b> parts of the potential, the Boltzmann relation is used. For electron-attractive parts of the potential we employ a power law which contains a parameter {{that can be used to}} control the number of trapped electrons. We perform a set of runs varying the parameter and select the one with the smallest number of trapped electrons which still behaves in a physically meaningful way in the sense of producing not more than one solar wind ion deflection shock upstream of the tether. By this prescription we obtain thrust per tether length values that are in line with earlier estimates, although somewhat smaller. We conclude that the Boltzmann PIC simulation is a new tool for simulating the E-sail thrust. This tool enables us to calculate solutions rapidly and allows to easily study different scenarios for trapped electrons...|$|E
