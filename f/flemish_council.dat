60|$|The councils of all {{the great}} towns of Flanders {{assembled}} at Sluys, and for several days great festivities were held. Then a great assembly was held, and Van Artevelde rose and addressed his countrymen. He set forth to them {{the virtues of the}} Prince of Wales, whose courtesy and bearing had so captivated them; he pointed out the obligations which Flanders was under towards King Edward, and the advantages which would arise from a nearer connection with England. With this he contrasted the weakness of their count, the many ills which his adherence to France had brought upon the country, and the danger which menaced them should his power be ever renewed. He then boldly proposed to them that they should at once cast off their allegiance to the count and bestow the vacant coronet upon the Prince of Wales, who, as Duke of Flanders, would undertake the defence and government of the country {{with the aid of a}} <b>Flemish</b> <b>council.</b> This wholly unexpected proposition took the Flemish burghers by surprise. Artevelde had calculated upon his eloquence and influence carrying them away, but his power had diminished, and many of his hearers had already been gained to the cause of France. The burgher councils had for a long time had absolute power in their own towns, and the prospect of a powerful prince at their head foredoomed a curtailment of those powers. When Artevelde ceased, therefore, instead of the enthusiastic shouts with which he hoped his oration would be greeted, a confused murmur arose. At last several got up and said that, greatly attached as they were to the king, much as they admired the noble young prince proposed for their acceptance, they felt themselves unable to give an answer upon an affair of such moment without consulting their fellow countrymen and learning their opinions. They therefore promised that they would return on a certain day and give a decided answer.|$|E

50|$|On 21 December 1978 a Royal Decree instituted the Subcommittee of Heraldry {{within the}} Royal Commission for Monuments and Sites with {{instructions}} {{to report on}} the municipalities' proposals. Following the revision of the Belgian constitution of 1980, the Subcommittee was upgraded to become the independent <b>Flemish</b> Heraldic <b>Council</b> by the decree of the Flemish Government of 11 April 1984. The task of the Council in matters of local heraldry has always been advisory. It considers the symbolism and design of the arms and flags, bearing in mind historical precedents. In many cases it makes suggestions for improvement. Upon recommendation by the Council, the municipal arms and flag are given official approval. Until 1980 the approval took the form of a Royal Decree. Since then it is issued as a Decree of the competent Flemish minister. Under the aegis of the <b>Flemish</b> Heraldic <b>Council,</b> <b>Flemish</b> municipal heraldry has gone through a complete overhaul. The task of assigning a proper coat of arms and flag to each municipality was completed by the early 1990s. In the process care was taken to rectify errors from the past, execute drawings in a clear style and standardize the blazon. While municipal coats of arms have to be in keeping with local historic and heraldic heritage, considerably more creativity is allowed in the design of flags.|$|R

50|$|The {{study of}} local {{cultures}} in India {{has so far}} been confined to the traditional approach of the departments of folk culture, English literature and socio-anthropological studies. There is a need to release the study of local cultures from these confines and to put it in a broader framework of interdisciplinary studies. Recognizing this, some of us, from within the Kuvempu University and the Research Centre Vergelijkende Cultuurwetenschap in Belgium came together to set up the Centre for the Study of Local Cultures (CSLC). Financial assistance for this project is provided by the <b>Flemish</b> Interuniversity <b>Council</b> - VLIR.

In 2015 {{libraries}} {{from five}} Cuban universities supported {{by an international}} project sponsored by the <b>Flemish</b> Interuniversity <b>Council</b> (VLIR), started the development of digital libraries using Dspace to manage all the scientific and academic outputs stored in their collections with the aim to socialize, preserve and increase the visibility of the scientific and academic production at national and international level. This paper presents the main features of the first Cuban Digital Library Network, the characteristics of each repository and other platforms, their interoperability {{and the development of}} a national harvester system to allow the information’s search and retrieval through a single interface. At this moment all five digital libraries are full operating allowing the visibility and socialization of more than nine thousands thesis produced by students and postgraduate's programs from five Cuban universities. During 2017 academic and research’s staff will add their scientific production (journal articles, books and book’s chapter, and other scientific documents) making possible to duplicate the amount early cited. A librarian team defined a metadata set from the Dublin Core Qualified to homogenize the documents description, according to the type of documents that these digital libraries will store and with the Metadata Export Guidelines released by OpenAIRE. Cuban Ministry of High Education, following the experience of the five universities included in the consortial environment it decide to lead a national project to expand this experience to the rest of Cuban universities (more than 21). The interoperability of more than 20 digital libraries will allow the genesis and management in 2018 of the bigger digital collection available in Cuba, including scientific and academic and also other digital collections stored in our libraries. Also a national catalog will be available with the information about all printed collection stored in Cuban universities.
