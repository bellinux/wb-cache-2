Previously, end users had to install CD burning software. In Windows XP, CD and DVD-RAM (FAT32 only for DVD-RAM) burning has been directly integrated into the Windows interface. Data discs are created using the Joliet and ISO 9660 file systems and audio CDs using the Redbook standard. To prevent buffer underrun errors, Windows XP premasters a complete image of files to be burnt and then streams it to the disc burner. Users can burn files to a CD {{in the same way}} they write files to a floppy disk or to the hard drive via standard copy-paste or drag and drop methods.

Numerical calculations along with experimental verification on actual transformer windings are presented. This study reveals that most of the natural frequencies that are normally non-excitable in the line and neutral current responses of an interleaved winding have been rendered excitable in the <b>disk-to-disk</b> voltages, thus, providing favourable conditions for insulation overstress because of resonant overvoltages.

40|$|As {{network data}} rates scale-up, an {{understanding}} of how and why traffic characteristics change is needed. We study the characteristics of bulk data transfer TCP/IP flows in a fully-switched Gigabit Ethernet network. Both <b>disk-to-disk</b> and memory-to-memory transfers are studied. We investigate flow characteristics as a function of link speed, server load, operating system (Linux and WindowsNT), and number of simultaneous clients accessing a server. Using trace-based simulations, we find that there is great variability in the "friendliness" of a flow to a single-server queue in terms of packet losses. Flows on Gigabit Ethernet tend to cause greater packet losses for a given link utilization and buffer size under certain conditions. We also find some unexplained inefficiencies in some of the flows. We investigate methods of application-level traffic smoothing to improve flow characteristics. A prototype packet-spacing socket send function is developed to reduce packet losses. 1...|$|E

40|$|Flat Datacenter Storage (FDS) is a high-performance, fault-tolerant, large-scale, locality-oblivious blob store. Using a novel {{combination}} of full bisection bandwidth networks, data and metadata striping, and flow control, FDS multiplexes an applicationâ€™s large-scale I/O across the available throughput and latency budget of every disk in a cluster. FDS therefore makes many optimizations around data locality unnecessary. Disks also {{communicate with each}} other at their full bandwidth, making recovery from disk failures extremely fast. FDS is designed for datacenter scale, fully distributing metadata operations that might otherwise become a bottleneck. FDS applications achieve single-process read and write performance of more than 2 GB/s. We measure recovery of 92 GB data lost to disk failure in 6. 2 s and recovery from a total machine failure with 655 GB of data in 33. 7 s.

40|$|Abstract: The {{continued}} growth {{of data and}} high-continuity of application have raised a critical and mounting demand on storage-efficient and high-performance data protection. New technologies, especially the D 2 D (<b>Disk-to-Disk)</b> de-duplication storage are therefore getting wide attention both in academic and industry in the recent years. Existing de-duplication systems mainly rely on duplicate locality inside the backup workload to achieve high throughput but suffer from read performance degrading under conditions of poor duplicate locality. This paper presents the design and perform-ance evaluation of a D 2 D-based de-duplication file backup system, which employs caching techniques to improve write throughput while encoding files as graphs called BP-DAGs (Bi-pointer-based Directed Acyclic Graphs). BP-DAGs not only satisfy the 'unique ' chunk storing policy of de-duplication, but also help improve file read performance in case of poor duplicate locality workloads. Evaluation {{results show that the}} system can achieve comparable read performance than non de-duplication backup systems such as Bacula under representative workloads, and the metadata storage overhead for BP-DAGs are reasonably low...|$|E

40|$|Abstractâ€”Motivated by {{the need}} to {{distribute}} large volumes of scientific data to large numbers of subscribers, we propose a reliable multicast transport protocol. Specifically, this protocol is developed for use on virtual circuits, since dynamic circuit services are now being offered by large providers, and virtual circuit networking is well suited to multicasting as it eliminates the data-plane congestion control problem of connectionless IP. The new protocol is called Virtual Circuit Multicast Transport Protocol (VCMTP). A key concept is to execute retransmissions (required due to flow control problems) at the end, i. e., after the message (file or memory data) is multicast. This leads to scalability, where the throughput for the receivers that can keep pace with the sending rate is independent of the number of receivers. A prototype was tested on Emulab, and measurements obtained. Our findings are that for <b>disk-to-disk</b> file transfers at a sending rate of 600 Mbps, the Emulab hosts can support multicasting with less than 0. 5 % retransmission rates, but at a 800 Mbps sending rate, the average throughput is only 650 Mbps because the retransmission rate increases to 9 %.

40|$|Abstract. In this study, CrZrN {{film was}} {{deposited}} on AISI 4130 cylinder barrel and valve plate using a unbalanced magnetron sputtering. The tribological properties between a coated steel cylinder barrel and coated steel valve plate {{were evaluated by}} a custom-built <b>disk-to-disk</b> tribometer {{and the results were}} compared with those between a coated steel cylinder barrel and a conventional bronze valve plate. The lowest friction coefficients were observed between a coated steel cylinder barrel and coated steel valve plate and they were approximately one half of those between a coated steel cylinder barrel and conventional bronze valve plate in the range of testing up to 1600 rpm. Coated valve plate and bronze valve plate showed a steady state of friction coefficient at approximately 0. 03 and 0. 06, respectively after about 1000 rpm, but steel valve plate without coating showed a continuous decrease in friction coefficient, which suggested that active wear is continuously occurring. By applying CrZrN coating on the commercial cylinder barrel and steel valve plate, much improved tribological results could be obtained, by a factor of approximately 2 in terms of friction coefficient than those from bronze valve plate. Under a tap water environment CrZrN coating appeared to perform better than CrSiN coating. Although further work to reduce the friction coefficient below 0. 13 in the steady state after initial drop is still needed, possibilities of applying CrZrN coating to realize a water hydraulic pump were demonstrated through the present work...|$|E

Its high performance is proven by implementation of a microfluidic genotyping assay testing 22 DNA samples including clinical isolates from patients infected by methicilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The microfluidic cartridges (disks) are fabricated by a novel process called microthermoforming by soft lithography (microTSL). Positive moulds are applied allowing for higher moulding precision and very easy demoulding when compared to conventional microthermoforming. High replication accuracies with geometric <b>disk-to-disk</b> variations of less than 1 % are typical. We describe and characterise fabrication and application of microfluidic cartridges with wall thicknesses < 188 microm thus enabling efficient thermocycling during real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The microfluidic cartridges are designed for operation in a slightly modified commercial thermocycling instrument. This approach demonstrates new opportunities for both microfluidic developments and well-established laboratory instruments. The microfluidic protocol is controlled by centrifugal forces and divides the liquid sample parallely into independent aliquots of 9. 8 microl (CV 3. 4 %, N = 32 wells). The genotyping assays are performed with pre-stored primers and probes for real-time PCR showing a limit of detection well below 10 copies of DNA per reaction well (N = 24 wells in 3 independent disks).

40|$|DotGrid {{platform}} is a Grid infrastructure integrated {{with a set}} of open and standard protocols recently implemented on the top of Microsoft. NET in Windows and MONO. NET in UNIX/Linux. DotGrid infrastructure along with its proposed protocols provides a right and solid approach to targeting other platforms, e. g., the native C/C++ runtime. In this paper, we propose a new file transfer protocol called DotDFS as a high-throughput distributed file transfer component for DotGrid. DotDFS introduces some open binary protocols for efficient file transfers on current Grid infrastructures. DotDFS protocol also provides mechanisms for multiple file streams to gain high-throughput file transfer similar to GridFTP protocol, but by proposing and implementing a new parallel TCP connection-oriented paradigm. In our LAN tests, we have achieved better results than Globus GridFTP implementation particularly in multiple TCP streams and directory tree transfers. Our LAN experiences in memory-to-memory tests show that DotDFS accesses to the 94 % bottleneck bandwidth while GridFTP is accessing 91 %. In LAN <b>disk-to-disk</b> tests, comparing DotDFS protocol with GridFTP protocol unveils a set of interesting and technical problems in GridFTP for both the nature of the protocol and its implementation by Globus. In the WAN experimental studies, we propose a new idea for analytical modeling of file transfer protocols like DotDFS inspired by sampling, experimentation and mathematical interpolation approaches. The cross-platform and open standard-based features of DotDFS provide a substantial framework for unifying data access and resource sharing in real heterogeneous Grid environments.

Over time these windows have shrunk to near non-existence due to the globalization of business through its use of the Internet and the World Wide Web. While tape system speeds have accelerated and tape capacities have increased, they have not {{keep pace with the}} demand for shorter backup windows, quicker restoration requirements, and the rapidly escalating volume of disk drive data being backed up. At the same time, the cost of PC disk drives ("ATA" computer interface) has dropped to be competitive with tape, and <b>disk-to-disk</b> (D 2 D) backup has become popular, particularly using the new Serial ATA (SATA) PC drives. A D 2 D system can run at the full speed of disk, and can use the higher capacity of PC disk drives (up to 400 Gbytes today), because backup is primarily serial data storage not needing the high high random access speed of the enterprise storage systems being backed up (which get high random access speed by running many smaller capacity disks in parallel). The current interest in SATA D 2 D backup is of concern because these are PC drives sold with narrow profit margins that limit drive reliability. This paper addresses the fact that the reliability of SATA PC drives is inherently lower than enterprise-class drives (SCSI and Fiber Channel "SCSI/FC"). Methods are proposed for SATA storage system designers to achieve high system level reliability by requiring appropriate SATA drive reliability testing, by increased RAID redundancy, and by system management of drive failure warnings.
