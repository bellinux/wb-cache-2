50|$|Feldhamer et al. (1988) and Geist (1998) {{included}} <b>Dama</b> <b>mesopotamica</b> as a subspecies of Dama dama, {{though it}} {{was regarded as a}} separate species by Haltenorth (1959), Ferguson et al. (1985), Uerpmann (1987), and Harrison and Bates (1991). IUCN follow Pitra et al. (2004) and Randi et al. (2001) in treating D. mesopotamica as a separate species, based on a major study on the evolution and phylogeny of Old World deer. Thus, a majority of scientists consider it as <b>Dama</b> <b>mesopotamica.</b> Moreover, Khuzestan Province, where 25 deer are found, is historically a part of ancient Mesopotamia.|$|R
50|$|The reserve may hava {{also been}} home to many extinct species in Lebanon such as: roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), Persian fallow deer (<b>Dama</b> <b>dama</b> <b>mesopotamica),</b> Anatolian leopard (Panthera pardus tulliana), Syrian brown bear (Ursus arctos syriacus), and the aurochs (Bos primigenius).|$|R
25|$|The Zagros {{are home}} to many {{threatened}} or endangered organisms, including the Zagros Mountains mouse-like hamster (Calomyscus bailwardi), the Basra reed-warbler (Acrocephalus griseldis) and the striped hyena (Hyena hyena). The Persian fallow deer (<b>Dama</b> <b>dama</b> <b>mesopotamica),</b> an ancient domesticate once thought extinct, was rediscovered in the late 20th century in Khuzestan province in the southern Zagros.|$|R
50|$|The dog, sheep, {{goats and}} {{possibly}} cattle and pigs were introduced, {{as well as}} numerous wild animals such as foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and Persian fallow deer (<b>Dama</b> <b>mesopotamica)</b> that were previously unknown on the island. The PPNB settlers built round houses with floors made of terrazzo of burned lime (e.g. Kastros, Shillourokambos) and cultivated einkorn and emmer. Pigs, sheep, goat and cattle were kept but remained, for the most part, behaviourally wild. Evidence of cattle such as that attested at Shillourokambos is rare, and when they apparently died out {{in the course of}} the 8th millennium they were not re-introduced until the ceramic Neolithic.|$|R
40|$|Zooarchaeologists are {{beginning}} to produce more data on age profiles and sex ratios in archaeological faunal assemblages, but often lack the ecological basis to interpret these data. This thesis reviews the ethological literature on four main prey species found in southwest Asia faunal assemblages during the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene: gazelle (Gazella sp.), Fallow deer (<b>Dama</b> <b>dama</b> <b>mesopotamica),</b> wild goat (Capra ibex) and wild sheep (Ovis sp.). This ethological review is used to develop models which predict the age and sex composition of archaeological faunal assemblages that were produced during different seasons and by different hunting techniques. Finally, {{a review of the}} archaeological record from the Pleistocene/Holocene transition in southwest Asia puts the age and sex ratios from archaeofaunas into the context of economic intensification and domestication...|$|R
40|$|The Persian {{fallow deer}} (<b>Dama</b> <b>dama</b> <b>mesopotamica)</b> {{formerly}} {{widespread in the}} Middle East was described scientifically {{at the end of}} the 19 th century and considered extinct ever since. In 1956 it was rediscovered in south-western Iran. As a result, several countries have undertaken actions to reintroduce this subspecies in its native territory. In 2007 the Christian Oswald Foundation, in close cooperation with Iranian institutions, launched plans of in situ and ex situ breeding actions, with its centre in the German Von Opel Zoo and with cooperative Mediterranean partner coun-tries as Israel, to support conservation efforts under scientific control. We performed genetic studies to study the suspected hybridization with European fallow deer (Dama dama dama) and a commitment to preserve pureblood populations. We used a set of microsatellite loci to examine genetic variation and recen...|$|R
5000|$|Pahlavi {{assisted}} {{in the creation of}} Iran's first game laws and game enforcement agency, and helped establish more than 20 million acres of reserves and parks in Iran. While criticized for promoting trophy hunting for himself and friends, Pahlavi aggressively pursued poachers while head of the Iranian Dept. of the Environment, establishing one of the most extensive and successful big-game management programs in the developing world. [...] He was also responsible for enacting law protecting endangered species such as the gazelle, Caspian tiger, wild ass, cheetah, and the Persian fallow deer from extinction, imposing stiff fines for game law violators. In 1978, he approved the transfer of four Persian fallow deer from Iran to Israel before the fall of the Shah. According to a survey by an Iranian environmentalist, Hoshang Zeaee, overhunting and environmental destruction since 1978 has resulted in the extinction of several species once native to the Iranian plateau, including the Jebeer Gazelle (Gazella Dorcas Fuscifrons) Persian Wild Ass (Equus Hermionus) Alborz Red Sheep (Ovis Ammon Orientaliss) Asian Cheetah ( [...] Acinonyx Jubatus) Persian Fallow Deer (<b>Dama</b> <b>Mesopotamica)</b> and Goitered Gazelle (Gazella Subgutturosia).|$|R
2500|$|Mammals: Mammal explorations in Lebanon {{were limited}} until {{around the middle}} of the twentieth century. They are fragmentary and {{provided}} little information on the mammals inhabiting the country. Many species and sub-species were not yet recorded for Lebanon till the 1970s. Between 1980 and 1985, Tohmé, G. and Tohmé, H. alone produced 33% of the known published papers on the Lebanese mammals. The only documented data of the mammals of Al-Shouf Cedar Reserve apparently appeared in the report of Tohmé, H. that was prepared, on behalf of the Protected Areas Project at the Ministry of Environment, in 1999 by the NCSR. This report, which was based on inventory and surveys as well as brochures and other documents developed by the managing team of the reserve, produced a list of 32 mammals which include: wild boar (Sus scrofa), gray wolf (Canis lupus [...] ), beech marten (Martes foina), mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella), golden jackal (Canis aureus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), European badger (Meles meles), Cape hare (Lepus capensis), Caucasian squirrel (Sciurus anomalus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), Persian fallow deer (<b>Dama</b> <b>dama</b> <b>mesopotamica),</b> wild goat (Capra aegagrus), Syrian brown bear (Ursus arctos syriacus), Middle East blind mole-rat (Nannospalax ehrenbergi) Indian porcupine (Hystrix indica), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), wild cat (Felis silvestris), Cape hyrax (Procavia capensis). The reserve launched a project to reintroduce the Nubian ibex (Capra nubiana) to the area from Jordan, after it was extinct in the mid-twentieth century. The reserve was most probably home to the Anatolian leopard (Panthera pardus tulliana) which are extinct now in Lebanon. The aurochs (Bos primigenius) may have existed in the area in the middle ages as well.|$|R
50|$|The oldest {{evidence}} of neolithic settlement is dated to 8800-8600 BC. The first settlers were already agriculturalists (PPNB), {{but did not}} yet produce pottery (aceramic Neolithic). They introduced the dog, sheep, goats and maybe cattle and pigs as well as numerous wild animals like foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and Persian fallow deer (<b>Dama</b> <b>mesopotamica)</b> that were previously unknown on the island. The PPNB settlers built round houses with floors made of terrazzo of burned lime (e.g. Kastros, Shillourokambos, Tenta) and cultivated einkorn and emmer. Pig, sheep, goat and cattle were kept, but remained morphologically wild. Evidence for cattle (attested at Shillourokambos) is rare and when they apparently died out {{in the course of}} the 8th millennium they were not reintroduced until the early Bronze Age.In the 6th millennium BC, the aceramic Choirokoitia culture (Neolithic I) was characterized by round houses (tholoi), stone vessels and an economy based on sheep, goats and pigs. The daily life of the people in those Neolithic villages was spent in farming, hunting, animal husbandry and the lithic industry, while homesteaders (likely women) were engaged in spindling and weaving cloths, in addition to their probable participation in other activities. The lithic industry was the most individual feature of this aceramic culture and innumerable stone vessels made of grey andesite have been discovered during excavations. The houses had a foundation of river pebbles, the remainder of the building was constructed in mudbrick. Sometimes several round houses were joined together to form a kind of compound. Some of these houses reach a diameter of up to 10 m. Inhumation burials are located inside the houses.|$|R
40|$|Foot {{and mouth}} disease (FMD) {{epidemics}} recur in Israel almost every year. Wild even-toed ungulates are seldom affected during these epidemics. The sero-prevalence of FMD in wild ungulates during 2000 and 2005 - 13 was estimated using anti non-structural proteins (NSP) ELISA. Overall, 209 samples were tested, comprising sera of 120 wild boar (Sus scrofa lybicus), 64 mountain gazelles (Gazella gazella gazella), six water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis), and 19 Persian fallow deer (<b>Dama</b> <b>dama</b> <b>mesopotamica).</b> None of the tested animals presented clinical signs of FMD during blood collection. Sixteen samples (7. 7 % (95 % confidence interval (CI 95 %) = 4. 4 - 12. 1 %)) {{were found to}} be sero-positive. Fifteen out of 120 samples (12. 5 %) from wild boar were sero-positive, compared with only one out of 89 samples (1. 1 %) from all other species combined (Fisher's Exact test: p= 0. 003). Most of the positive samples obtained from wild boar (13 / 15 (86. 7 %)) were collected during 2007 and analysis was restricted to that year and species only. The sero-prevalence of FMD in this species during 2007 was estimated at 54. 2 % (CI 95 %= 32. 8 - 74. 5 %; n= 24). A significant infection cluster, comprising nine sero-positive samples collected in three different locations, was identified in the north-eastern part of Israel. These findings indicate that wild boar were affected during the 2007 FMD epidemic, even though wild boar presenting FMD typical clinical signs were not observed during that year. The actual role of wild boar in the spread of FMD virus in this epidemic, however, could not be determined. The negligible sero-prevalence of FMD found for all other surveillance years indicates that ongoing circulation of FMD among wildlife in Israel is unlikely. It is concluded that while the role of wildlife species in the dynamics of FMD in Israel is usually limited, there might be occasions in which wildlife play a part in the spread of the virus...|$|R

The aurochs (Bos primigenius) may have existed in the area in the middle ages as well.Birds: The reserve is home to 200 species of birds, of which 19 are considered rare at the national level. More than 22 species have been confirmed to be resident, the rest are migratory or rare visitors, and {{at least two or three}} species have been introduced. The reserve holds a combination of birds found in Europe, Africa, and Asia which include: chukar (Alectoris chukar), Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius), blackbird (Turdus merula), common raven (Corvus corax), common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus), shore lark (Eremophila alpestris), common redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus), common chaffinch, (Fringilla coelebs), turtle dove (Streptopelia turtur), rock sparrow (Petronia petronia), European goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis). [...] Two species at least have been introduced to the shouf area for hunting and expanded their range into the reserve, the two species are: rock partridge (Alectoris graeca), and common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus). The reserve is also home to many species of birds of prey such as: griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus), and the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos).Reptiles and amphibians: Al-shouf cedar reserve is home to a rich variety of reptiles, 26 species were documented with two species endemic to Lebanon and the chouf area in particular. The reserve is also home to four species of amphibians, almost the same number of species found in the whole of Lebanon. The species include: Palestinian viper (Vipera palaestinae), Greek tortoise (Testudo graeca), Mediterranean chameleon (Chamaeleon chamaeleon), European copper skink (Ablepharus kitaibelii), common toad (Bufo bufo), European green toad (Bufo viridis), Arouss Al Ayn (Salamandra infraimmaculata), Middle East tree frog (Hyla savignyi).|$|R
