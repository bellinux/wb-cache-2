5|$|A Bypass M-21 (Byp. M-21) {{designation}} {{was created}} in the Grand Rapids area in 1945. This designation ran from the corner of 28th Street and Chicago Drive along Byp. US16 and Byp. US131 on 28th Street. At East Beltline Avenue, Byp. US131/Byp. M-21 turned north back to M-21. M-21A in Flint was turned over to local control in 1948, <b>decommissioning</b> the number. The Byp. M-21 routing was replaced by M-21 in 1953. The former routing in Grand Rapids became Bus. M-21 instead.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of its <b>decommissioning,</b> US16 started its run through Michigan at the Grand Trunk Western Railroad docks in Muskegon. The SS Milwaukee Clipper {{operated}} as a car ferry across Lake Michigan, connecting Muskegon to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where US16 continued to the west. From the docks, US16 and M-46 traveled concurrently south and then east through downtown Muskegon. At Peck Street, US16 turned south along Business US31 (Bus. US31). These two highways ran concurrently out of town to the south through Muskegon Heights to Norton Shores. There, the business loop ended at US31, and US16 joined the I-196 freeway headed east. (Later, the I-96 and I-196 designations west of Grand Rapids would be flipped, but at the time leading up to US16's <b>decommissioning</b> in the state of Michigan, this had not yet been approved.) The I-196/US16 freeway traveled southeast of Norton Shores through woodlands in rural Muskegon County parallel to the former US16 routing through Fruitport to Nunica in Ottawa County. The freeway turned more directly east in Nunica past the eastern terminus of M-104, and continued through more mixed forest and grassland terrain to serve the communities of Coopersville and Marne.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} she was {{decommissioned}} in 1969, Tiptoe was the last active T-class submarine in the Royal Navy.

She was sold in 1971 and scrapped at Portsmouth in 1975. Her anchor was saved, and was mounted on stone in 1979 in Blyth, Northumberland.

5|$|During World War II, {{the state}} was {{building}} a beltline system for Grand Rapids. This highway, numbered M-114 was decommissioned by 1945 and the streets that composed it were given new designations. Byp. M-21 was routed along 28th Street from Grandville to Paris Township and along East Beltline into Grand Rapids Township. In 1953, the mainline M-21 was rerouted to replace its bypass around downtown, <b>decommissioning</b> the Byp. M-21 designation.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>decommissioning</b> in 1997, {{the ship}} was {{earmarked}} for preservation as a museum ship in Mumbai.

In 2001, {{the ship was}} opened to the public by the Indian Navy, but the Government of Maharashtra was unable to find a partner to operate the museum on a permanent, long-term basis and the museum was closed after it was deemed unsafe for the public in 2012.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, {{the first}} M-108 {{designation}} was commissioned along a rare three-legged route connecting the State Highway Ferry Docks with the Fort Michilimackinac State Historic Park and US 31. At one point while traveling westbound on M-108, motorists could turn right onto northbound M-108 or left onto southbound M-108. In {{preparation for the}} opening of the Mackinac Bridge, the Michigan State Highway Department transferred all of M-108 to local control in late 1957, <b>decommissioning</b> the designation at the same time. In 1960, the current M-108 was commissioned along the final routing.|$|E

NIREX developed a generic repository concept based on the Swedish model but has not yet selected a site.

5|$|In 1989, Blyth A won a {{place in}} the Guinness Book of Records by setting the world record for total running hours in a plant of its size, when all four {{generating}} units achieved 200,000running hours. With the privatisation of the UK's electricity supply industry in 1990, the station passed into the ownership of National Power. In 1991, the two 275MW units at Blyth B (units 5 & 6) were decommissioned on the grounds of economy, despite the station having been modernised in the early 1980s. This <b>decommissioning</b> resulted in 260 job losses.|$|E
