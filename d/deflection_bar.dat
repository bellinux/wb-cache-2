40|$|Self {{consolidating}} concrete (SCC) {{is widely}} used in the construction industry. SCC is a high performance concrete with high workability and consistency allowing it to flow under its own weight without vibration and making the construction of heavily congested structural elements and narrow sections easier. Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcement, with its excellent mechanical properties and non-corrosive characteristic, is {{being used as a}} replacement for conventional steel reinforcement. In spite of the wide spread of SCC applications, bond and flexural behaviour of SCC beams reinforced or prestressed with FRP bars has not been fully studied. Furthermore, the ACI 440. 1 R- 06 equation for determining the development length of FRP bars is based on Glass FRP (GFRP) bars and may not be applicable for Carbon FRP (CFRP) bars. This research program included an experimental and analytical study to investigate the flexural and bond behaviour of SCC beams reinforced with FRP bars and SCC beams prestressed with CFRP bars. In the experimental phase, fifty-six beams were fabricated and tested. Sixteen of these beams were prestressed with CFRP bars and forty beams were reinforced with non-prestressed GFRP or CFRP bars. Four concrete batches were used to fabricate all the specimens. Three mixes were of self consolidating concrete (SCC) and one mix was of normal vibrated concrete (NVC). The test parameters for the non-prestressed beams were the concrete type, bar type and bar diameter, concrete cover thickness and embedment length while the test parameters for the prestressed beams were the concrete type and the prestressing level (30 %, 45 % and 60 %). The transfer length of the prestressed CFRP bars was determined by means of longitudinal concrete strain profile and draw-in methods. All beams were tested in four-point bending to failure. Measurements of load, midspan <b>deflection,</b> <b>bar</b> slip if any at the beam ends, strain in reinforcing FRP bar at various locations, and strain in concrete at the beam midspan were collected during the flexural test. The concrete compressive strength at flexural tests of SCC mix- 1, mix- 2, and mix- 3 were 62. 1 MPa, 49. 6 MPa and 70. 9 MPa, respectively and for the NVC mix was 64. 5 MPa. The material test results showed that SCC mixes had lower modulus of elasticity mechanical properties than the NVC mix. The modulus of elasticity of the SCC mixes ranged between 65 % and 82 % of the NVC mix. The modulus of rupture of the SCC mixes was 86 % of the NVC mixes. The test results for beams prestressed with CFRP bars revealed that the variation of transfer length of CFRP bars in SCC versus their prestressing level was nonlinear. The average measured transfer lengths of 12. 7 mm diameter CFRP bars prestressed to 30 %, 45 % and 60 % was found to be 25 db, 40 db, 54 db, respectively. Measured transfer lengths of the 12. 7 mm diameter CFRP bar prestressed to 30 % in SCC met the ACI 440. 4 prediction. However, as the prestressing level increased, the predicted transfer length became unconservative. At a 60 % prestress level, the measured/prediction ratio was 1. 25. Beams prestressed with CFRP bars and subjected to flexural testing with shear spans less than the minimum development length had local bar slippage within the transmission zone. Beams that experienced local bond slip, their stiffness was significantly decreased. A modification to the existing model used to calculate the transfer and development lengths of CFRP bars in NVC beams was proposed to account for the SCC. The test results for beams reinforced with FRP bars indicated that the average bond strength of CFRP bars in NVC concrete is about 15 % higher than that of GFRP bars in NVC. The ACI 440. 1 R- 06 equation overestimated the development length of the CFRP bars by about 40 %, while CAN/CSA-S 6 - 06 equation was unconservative by about 50 %. A new factor of (1 / 1. 35) was proposed to estimate the development length of the CFRP bars in NVC when the ACI 440. 1 R- 06 equation is used. Beams made from SCC showed closer flexural crack spacing than similar beams made from NVC at a similar loading. The deflection of beams made from SCC and reinforced with CFRP bars was found to be slightly larger than those made from NVC. The average bond stresses of GFRP and CFRP bars in SCC were comparable to those in NVC. However, FRP bars embedded in SCC beams had higher bond stresses within the uncracked region of the beams than those embedded in NVC beams. In contrast, FRP bars in SCC had lower bond stresses than FRP bars in NVC within the cracked region. The average bond strength of GFRP in SCC was increased by 15 % when the concrete cover thickness increased from 1. 0 db to 3. 0 db. Cover thicknesses of 2 db and 3 db were found to be sufficient to prevent bond splitting failure of GFRP and CFRP bars in SCC, respectively. Bond splitting failure was recorded when the cover thickness dropped to 1. 5 db for the GRP bars and to 2. 0 db for the CFRP bars. An insignificant increase in average bond stress was found when the bar diameter decreased from 12. 7 mm to 6. 3 mm for the CFRP bars, and a similar increase occurred in GFRP bars when the bar diameter decreased from 15. 9 mm to 9. 5 mm. New models to calculate the development length of GFRP and CFRP bars embedded in SCC were proposed based on the experimental results. These models capture the average bond stress profile along the embedment length. A good agreement was found between the proposed model and the experimental results. Analytical modeling of the load-deflection response based on the effective moment of inertia (ISIS Canada M 5) was unconservative for SCC beams reinforced with CFRP bars by 25 % at ultimate loading. A new model for bond stress versus Ma/Mcr (applied moment to cracking moment) ratio was developed for GFRP and CFRP bars in SCC and for CFRP bars in NVC. These bond stress models were incorporated in a new rigorous model to predict the load-deflection response based on the curvature approach. The FRP bar extension and bond stress models were used to calculate the load-deflection response. With these models 90 % of the calculated deflections were found to be within ± 15 % of the experimental measured results for SCC beams reinforced with FRP bars. Analytical modeling of the load-deflection for NVC and SCC beams prestressed with CFRP bars are proposed done. The moment resistance was calculated using Sectional Analysis approach. The deflection was calculated using simplified and detailed methods. The simplified method was based on the effective moment of inertia while the detailed method was based on effective moment of inertia and effective centroid. The experimental results correlated well with the detailed method at higher loads range. This study provided an understanding of the mechanism of bond and flexural behaviour of FRP reinforced and prestressed SCC beams. The information presented in this thesis is valuable for designers using FRP bars as flexural reinforcement and also for the development of design guidelines for SCC structures...|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} an experimental and analytical investigation {{to compare the}} structural behaviour of externally bonded steel plates and Carbon Fiber Reinforceed Polymer (CFRP) laminates flexurally strengthened r. c. beams. For the experimental investigation, three r. c. beams were cast. One beam was tested in the un-strengthened condition to act as the control beam. The second beam was strengthened using steel plate while the third beam was strengthened using CFRP laminate. The strengthened beams were designed {{to have the same}} strength with the assumption that they would fail in a ductile manner. The test results indicated that although both beams were designed for the same strength, the CFRP laminate strengthened beam recorded a slightly higher failure load compared to the steel plate strengthened beam. The steel plate strengthened beam recorded a higher cracking load and less <b>deflections,</b> reinforcement <b>bar</b> strains, concrete strains and crack widths compared to the CFRP laminate strengthened beam. Results also showed that the CFRP laminate strengthened beam failed by premature concrete cover separation failure, whereas the steel plate strengthened beam failed by premature plate end interfacial debonding followed by concrete cover separation. The beams were also modelled using a Finite Element Method (FEM) package. The numerical results seemed to agree well with the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|An {{optimization}} study {{was performed to}} develop a minimum weight spreader bar to allow two helicopters to lift the same payload. With this arrangement, the maximum payload that can be lifted is almost doubled without the expense of designing and building a new helicopter. The concept has had some limited use by civil helicopter operators using small helicopters and has been demonstrated in large scale by two CH- 54 's which successfully lifted a total load of 20 ton. To this point, rather heavy available beams or tower structures {{have been used for}} the spreader bar. Since the weight of the bar not only detracts from payload but also adds to the logistics problem, there are more than the usual incentives to minimize weight. Since the design requirement is for classic beam column with uniform side loads resulting from bar weight and aerodynamic drag, the design problem is particularly amenable to optimization. A study has been performed at Sikorsky to establish the minimum weight for a spreader bar sized to carry a load equal to the capacity of two Army BLACK HAWK helicopters. Toward this end, a computer program was written to analyze the spreader <b>bar</b> <b>deflections</b> and stresses and coupled to the NASA developed CONMIN optimization routines...|$|R
40|$|In boring {{operations}} {{the vibrations}} are a cumbersome {{part of the}} manufacturing process. This report puts the vibrations under scrutiny and the vibrations were measured both in the cutting speed direction and the cutting depth direction. The cutting process {{seems to be a}} time varying process and contains nonstationary as well as nonlinear parameters that are not under control. The experiments showed that the vibrations were usually dominated by the first resonance frequency in either of the two directions of the boring bar. Sample probability density estimates of the vibration records points to that the probability densities are varying from sinusiodal probability shape to gaussian shape. They also indicate that shape of the two directions could be of different probability density function from the same vibration record. Stationarity tests show, besides that the processes usually are nonstationary, {{that it is possible to}} extract short time stationary segments within a vibration record. The problem with force modulation in rotary machinery, which appears as side band terms is the spectrum, is also addressed. Furthermore, the resonance frequencies of the boring bar are correlated to an approximate theoretical beam model. The theoretical calculation of the boring <b>bar</b> <b>deflection</b> corresponds well with the experimental results from the modal analysis and the operating deflection shape analysis...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} was initiated {{to examine the}} possibility of improving the rate of convergence of a series solution for the deflection of a swept cantilever plate of uniform thickness, using the Rayleigh-Ritz method, by applying the solution to low aspect ratio plates instead of high aspect ratio plates as had been done previously. The Rayleigh-Ritz deflection functions which were used were products of vibration modes of uniform clamped-free and free-free <b>bars.</b> <b>Deflections</b> were computed, using six terms in the series, for three different loading conditions at sweep angles of 20 °, 40 °, and 60 °. The results, plotted against experimental data in Figures 7 to 24, show {{that the rate of}} convergence is satisfactory only for angles of sweep of 20 ° or less. Since the cases of sweep of 20 ° or more are of most interest in the application to swept back aircraft wings, it was concluded that the rate of convergence is not satisfactory. The possibility of improving the rate of convergence of the series solution by solving for the difference between the true deflections and the deflections given by some approximate formula was indicated as the next step in arriving at a satisfactory solution. It was pointed out that the experimental data mentioned above would provide a valuable guide in the formulation of such an approximate formula...|$|R
40|$|Most of RC bridges in Okinawa Prefecture {{have been}} {{constructed}} near the shore and deterioration of concrete due to rust of reinforcing bars becomes serious. Several investigations such as surface observations, truck loading tests and bending failure tests of main beams have been performed. These are mainly for static and fatigue behavior of a beam becomes important for the consideration of durability. Generally, fatigue strength of materials such as concrete and reinforcing bars is the major factor in determination of strength of a beam and fatigue behavior of the beam has not been seriously studied. However, it is considered as important since significant deterioration has been observed recently. Two beams tested here were cut of a deteriorated bridge and the appearance showed spalls of concrete on surface. Apparent losses in cross section of bars and bond stress were observed. This paper {{presents the results of}} fatigue test subjected to repeated loads where increasing rates of <b>deflection,</b> strain of <b>bars</b> and crack width and effectiveness of bond stress were carefully investigated. The immediate conclusions are as follows: (1) The significant reduction of bending rigidity and increase of crack width were not observed after repeated load, but residual deflection, strain and crack width were not negligible. (2) Sudden failure of test beams occured due to brittle failure of a reinforcing bar, which could be explained as the overstressing of a particular bar as result of loss in bond stress at neighboring bars...|$|R
40|$|Buckling of {{longitudinal}} bars in {{reinforced concrete}} (RC) members {{is definitely a}} critical issue in framed structures subjected to seismic loads. Second order effects can affect the compressive stressâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 strain law of steel bars, influencing ductility calculations of RC structures. Moreover, literature studies show that buckling can occur over a length wider than stirrupsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 pitch (global buckling mode), involving more stirrups and inducing large <b>deflections</b> in the <b>bar.</b> If the critical length is not carefully estimated, stirrupsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 failure can occur, causing also the sudden loss of confining effects in concrete. This paper {{presents the results of}} different approaches for calculating the critical conditions in longitudinal bars. A discrete mechanical model is proposed, based on the solution of a continuous beam with elastic supports, with deflections restrained in one side to simulate the presence of the concrete core. It allows describing the transition from local buckling (between the stirrups) and global buckling, {{on the basis of the}} relative stiffness stirrup-bar. Two other methods corresponding to different computational efforts are also adopted for the sake of comparison. In particular, non-linear finite element analyses are carried out including the effect of strain hardening in the constitutive law of steel and finally, comparisons are made with a simplified closed-form solution proposed in the literature. This last comparison allows to assess the reliability of these expressions and their applications for obtaining parametric considerations useful for design...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{mechanical}} properties of fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) <b>bars,</b> <b>deflections</b> often drive {{the design of}} FRP reinforced concrete (RC) flexural members. This {{has led to an}} increasing number of studies focused on the analysis of short-term deflections of FRP RC beams. However, investigations and experimental data focused on long-term deflections are scarce. The time-dependent deflection in RC beams is a function of member geometry, material properties and loading characteristics. Maximum service loads, as well as repeated loading, affect the deflections under sustained loads. This paper presents the results and discussion of an experimental programme concerning eight glass FRP RC beams tested at service load, and subsequently subjected to sustained loading for 250. days. Two reinforcement ratios and two levels of sustained load were considered. The experimental results revealed an effect of the loading-unloading processes and the reinforcement ratio on short and time-dependent deflections. No significant influence of the sustained load level was observed. Moreover, the theoretical predictions obtained with different models have been compared with the experimental results. The modified time-dependent factor presented in ACI 440. 1 R- 06, together with the modified Bischoff's equation to compute the immediate deflections due to sustained load, give the best agreement with experimental deflectionsThe authors acknowledge the support provided by the Spanish Government (Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion), Project Ref.

40|$|In {{this project}} {{composite}} {{was made from}} epoxy resin of the type GY- 191 produced by Hexion Speciality Chemical Pty Ltd, epoxidised linseed oil locally produced from the University of Southern Queensland lab and fillers of sawdust and Evirospheres (SLG). Aradur- 250 amine was used as hardener. Ratio of epoxy resin to Aradur hardener was varied; the first ratio was 2 : 1 and last one was 3 : 1. Background information pressure on traditional building material such as concrete, timber and steel is becoming unbearable. As such a number of researches are being carried out throughout the world to look for material that will release pressure on building materials. For material to be accepted as a building material it’s physical, mechanical and structural properties have to be known to meet basic criteria for building material. Aims and objectives: The aims of the project were to investigate the physical, mechanical and structural properties of composite made from renewable resources (Epoxy resin and epoxidised vegetable oil (linseed oil (ELO)) and by using wastes material such as sawdust and SLG as fillers. Preparation Samples were prepared with different percentage in weight of sawdust and SLG. The two main sizes of sawdust used were 600 and 1650 microns. Percentage of SLG was varied as well as sawdust. The composite was subjected to preparation that includes weighing, mixing, curing, cutting to sizes and polishing. Curing was done {{at room temperature for}} 24 hours followed by 4 hours of 80 degrees Celsius in an industrial oven. Methodology: Three main tests were used in the investigation of the composite properties. The tests were flexural, impact fracture toughness and DMA analysis. Each of these tests was adopted to determine different expects of the mechanical, physical and structural properties. Both flexural and Impact fracture toughness tests were carried out using MTS alliance provided by CEEFC. The properties investigate in this methods include flexural modulus, peak load, peakstress, deflection and strain at failure. Samples specimen for flexural and impact toughness were made of bar shape with dimensions of 64 x 15 x 10 mm according MTS alliance specifications. DMA samples were smaller made according Q 800 specifications of 35 x 12 x 4 mm. DMA was used to determine thermal mechanical properties. The thermal properties determined were glass transition temperature (Tg), storage modulus, and tan delta. Results and Conclusion: Results obtained for the samples for flexural revealed flexural modulus of up to 1880 MPa for composite with sawdust and SLG in its composition. Composites samples with ELO have lower flexural modulus as compare to ones without ELO. The trend observed was that when more sawdust was added to the composite, storage, peak load, and flexural modulus increased up to a certain limit at which they drop. Addition of more sawdust was observed to lower <b>deflections</b> of composite <b>bars.</b> The result from various combinations of epoxy resin and waste material was compared to the one for the pure or neat epoxy resin. It was found that with addition of ELO, the physical, mechanical and structural properties were much lower compared with the neat epoxy resin properties...|$|R
