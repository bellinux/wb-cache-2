40|$|Damping {{higher order}} modes (HOMs) {{significantly}} to avoid beam instability {{is a challenge}} for the high current Energy Recovery Linac-based eRHIC at BNL. To avoid the overheating effect and high tuning sensitivity, current, a <b>new</b> band-stop <b>HOM</b> coupler is being designed at BNL. The <b>new</b> <b>HOM</b> coupler has a bandwidth of tens of MHz to reject the fundamental mode, which will avoid overheating due to fundamental frequency shifting because of cooling down. In addition, the S 21 parameter of the band-pass filter is nearly flat from first higher order mode to 5 times the fundamental frequency. The simulation {{results showed that the}} new couplers effectively damp HOMs for the eRHIC cavity with enlarged beam tube diameter and 2 120 {sup o} HOM couplers at each side of cavity. This paper presents the design of HOM coupler, HOM damping capacity for eRHIC cavity and prototype test results...|$|R

In the frame of a collaborative agreement, Fermilab will provide DESY with a cryomodule containing a string of four cavities. Seven 9 -cell Nb cavities were tested and six of them did reach accelerating gradient up to 24 MV/m almost twice more than design value of 14 MV/m. Two of these cavities are with <b>new</b> <b>HOM</b> couplers with improved design. In this paper we present all results of the vertical and horizontal tests...|$|R
40|$|We study two {{closely related}} operads: the Gelfand-Dorfman operad GD and the Conformal Lie Operad CLie. The latter is the operad {{governing}} the Lie conformal algebra structure. We prove Koszulity of the Conformal Lie operad using the Groebner bases theory for operads and an operadic analogue of the Priddy criterion. An example of deformation of an operad {{coming from the}} Hom structures is considered. In particular we study possible deformations of the Associative operad {{from the point of}} view of the confluence property. Only one deformation, the operad which governs the identity (α(ab)) c=a(α (bc)) turns out to be confluent. We introduce a <b>new</b> <b>Hom</b> structure, namely Hom [...] Gelfand-Dorfman algebras and study their basic properties. Comment: 24 page...|$|R
40|$|The 3 rd {{harmonic}} 3. 9 GHz {{accelerating cavity}} was {{proposed to improve}} the beam performance of the FLASH (TTF/DESY) facility [1]. In the frame of a collaborative agreement, Fermilab will provide DESY with a cryomodule containing a string of four cavities. In addition, a second cryomodule with one cavity will be fabricated for installation in the Fermilab photo-injector, which will be upgraded for the ILC accelerator test facility. The first 9 -cell Nb cavities were tested in a vertical setup and they didn't reach the designed accelerating gradient [2]. The main problem was a multipactor in the HOM couplers, which lead to overheating and quenching of the <b>HOM</b> couplers. <b>New</b> <b>HOM</b> couplers with improved design are integrated in the next 9 -cell cavities. In this paper we present all results of the vertical tests...|$|R

40|$|At free-electron linear accelerators, various High Order Modes (HOM) - both {{monopole}} and dipole - are excited. Extensive {{studies at}} DESY {{have shown that}} monitoring and analysis {{of some of these}} modes can be used for different applications including Beam Position Monitors (BPMs) and the reduction of wake-fields, the measurement of the beam phase with-respect-to RF signal in cavities, and the measurement of cavity alignment in the 1. 3 GHz cryo-modules. Three frequencies were chosen for further experiments: the 1. 3 GHz base frequency from the klystron, the 1. 7 GHz dipole mode and the 2. 4 GHz monopole mode. In order to realize the monitoring and analysis requirements, very high resolution measurements in amplitude, phase and shape (time resolution) are required for all three frequencies simultaneously. In this paper, we present the <b>new</b> <b>HOM</b> electronics prototype including a microstrip and stripline RF tri-passband filter design and measurements and the specialized MTCA. 4 Rear Transition Module for HOM measurements with an ultra-fast high-resolution AMC digitizer...|$|R
