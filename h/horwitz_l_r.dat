We concluded {{a study on the}} relationship of polar cap ion properties observed by TIDE near apogee with solar wind and IMF conditions. We found that in general H+ did not correlate as well as O+ with solar wind and IMF parameters. O+ density correlated(sub IMF), and Kp. At lower solar wind speeds, O+ density decreased with increasing latitude, but this trend was not observed at higher solar wind speeds. By comparing these results with results from other studies of O+ {{in different parts of the}} magnetosphere, we concluded that O+ ions often leave the ionosphere near the foot point of the cusp/cleft region, pass through the high-altitude polar cap lobes, and eventually arrive in the plasma sheet. We found that H+ outflows are a persistent feature of the polar cap and are not as dependent on the geophysical conditions; even classical polar wind models show H+ ions readily escaping owing to their low mass. Minor correlations with solar wind drivers were found; specifically, H+ density correlated best with IMF By, V(sub sw) B(sub IMF), and ESW(sub sw) ...|$|R
40|$|The 44 -amino-acid E 5 protein of bovine {{papillomavirus}} type 1 is {{the smallest}} transforming protein yet described. Previous results from our laboratory indicate that a hydrophobic core and specific carboxyl-terminal amino acids are required for the E 5 protein to exert its transforming function. In this study, additional substitution mutations were generated in the E 5 gene to determine the minimal amino acid sequence requirements for focus formation in mouse C 127 cells. In most cases examined, substitution of the hydrophobic middle third of the E 5 protein with unrelated hydrophobic sequences severely inhibited transforming activity. However, we have identified one hydrophobic amino acid sequence apparently unrelated to the wild-type one that can replace the middle third of the wild-type E 5 protein without affecting {{the ability of the}} protein to stably transform cells or interact with cell membranes. Furthermore, a mutant E 5 protein in which only the carboxyl-terminal 16 amino acids of the protein have been derived from E 5 sequences retains transforming activity. Since several residues in the carboxyl-terminal portion of the E 5 protein can be freely substituted with different amino acids (B. H. <b>Horwitz,</b> A. <b>L.</b> Burkhardt, <b>R.</b> Schlegel, and D. DiMaio, Mol. Cell. Biol. 8 : 4071 - 4078, 1988), the results reported here imply that much of the specific information necessary for cell transformation can be supplied by a subset of the carboxyl-terminal 16 amino acids of this protein...|$|R

40|$|Eddy {{length scales}} are {{calculated}} from satellite altimeter products {{and in an}} eddy-resolving model of the North Atlantic Ocean. Four different measures for eddy length scales are derived from kinetic energy densities in wave number space and spatial decorrelation scales. Observational estimates and model simulation agree well in all these measures near the surface. As found in previous studies, all length scales are, in general, decreasing with latitude. They are isotropic and proportional to the local first baroclinic Rossby radius (<b>L</b> <b>r)</b> north of about 30 °N, while south of 30 °N (or for <b>L</b> <b>r</b> > 30 km), zonal length scales tend to be larger than meridional ones, and (scalar) length scales show no clear relation to <b>L</b> <b>r</b> anymore. Instead, {{they appear to be}} related to the local Rhines scale. In agreement with a recent theoretical prediction by Theiss [2004], the observed and simulated pattern of eddy length scales appears to be indicative of two different dynamical regimes in the North Atlantic: anisotropic turbulence in the subtropics and isotropic turbulence in the subpolar North Atlantic. Both regions can be roughly characterized by the ration between <b>L</b> <b>r</b> and the Rhines scales (<b>L</b> <b>R),</b> with <b>L</b> <b>R</b> > <b>L</b> <b>r</b> in the isotropic region and <b>L</b> <b>R</b> < <b>L</b> <b>r</b> in the anisotropic region.

Finally, we study the commutators [b,T] for T belongs to a class KL of sublinear operators containing almost all fundamental operators in harmonic analysis related to L.
