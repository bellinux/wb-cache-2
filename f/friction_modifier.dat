40|$|Friction {{management}} {{has been carried}} out extensively in the majority of railway networks in the last few years. A popular practice is the application of <b>friction</b> <b>modifiers</b> to increase the adhesion level in contaminated wheel-rail contacts. Two <b>friction</b> <b>modifiers</b> have particularly been used or tested on several railway networks as adhesion enhancers to facilitate the traction and braking operation under poor adhesion conditions. However, for assessment of the performance the railway operators and infrastructure managers mostly rely on practical observations that do not elucidate completely the effectiveness and side effects of these adhesion enhancers. In this paper, the constituents of the two <b>friction</b> <b>modifiers</b> are identified and the solid components are analyzed. A twin-disk roller rig has been used to study their performance in dry and wet contacts under closely controlled laboratory conditions. The adhesion characteristics of both <b>friction</b> <b>modifiers</b> are examined for different slip ratios.

40|$|A {{proposed}} {{solution to the}} problem of rail corrugation on curves of urban lines is the use of <b>friction</b> <b>modifiers.</b> Recent experimental research indicates this approach can be effective.

40|$|AbstractThe real {{friction}} coefficients {{between the}} rails and the wheels on a 360 t and 10, 800 kW IORE locomotive were measured using the locomotive׳s in-built traction force measurement system. The locomotive {{consisted of two}} pair-connected locomotives had a CoCo+CoCo bogie configuration, and hauled a fully loaded set of 68 ore wagons (120 t/wagon). The measurements were performed both on rails in a dry condition and on rails lubricated with a water-based top-of-rail (ToR) <b>friction</b> <b>modifier</b> on the Iron Ore Line between the cities of Kiruna and Narvik in Northern Sweden and Norway, respectively. Since full-scale measurements like these are costly, the friction coefficients were also measured {{at the same time}} and place using a conventional hand-operated tribometer, with and without the ToR <b>friction</b> <b>modifier.</b> The most important results are that the real friction coefficient is definitely not constant and is surprisingly low (0. 10 – 0. 25) when the ToR <b>friction</b> <b>modifier</b> is used, and that it is also significantly dependent on the amount of ToR <b>friction</b> <b>modifier.</b> A large amount will reduce the friction coefficient. Furthermore, it is concluded that the real friction coefficients are in general lower than the friction coefficients measured with the hand-operated tribometer. A final remark is thus that the use of a water-based ToR <b>friction</b> <b>modifier</b> can give excessively low friction, which can result in unacceptably long braking distances...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} reported in this thesis {{was to investigate the}} viability and quantify the potential gains of improving fuel economy of the gasoline engine through strategic application of additives. An increased awareness of the link between greenhouse gas emissions and global warming means that there is a desire to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from transportation. There is therefore a growing emphasis on improving the fuel economy performance of vehicles. The addition of <b>friction</b> <b>modifier</b> additives to the fuel is one way to achieve this. Using bespoke in-cylinder sampling techniques, an understanding of the operation of the piston assembly, a system responsible for much of the power loss in the internal combustion engine, is developed. Validation is given to the hypothesis that fuel economy gains can be achieved through the application of <b>friction</b> <b>modifier</b> administered to the engine via the gasoline. Results show gasoline administered <b>friction</b> <b>modifier</b> additive can accumulate in the piston assembly lubricant at levels 77 times greater than the initial fuel treatment level. The performance {{of a large number of}} <b>friction</b> <b>modifier</b> additives were uniquely screened in a novel bench-top test which simulated the arduous in-cylinder conditions found in a firing gasoline engine. The test generated vast amounts of information which led to high performance formulations capable of reducing the friction coefficient in both the boundary and mixed lubrication regimes by around 50 % when compared with the result for the base oil alone. Surface analysis techniques were also employed 0 !l engineering surfaces coated with <b>friction</b> <b>modifier</b> additives and add to the knowledge of their mechanism of action. Finally a series of engine tests were conducted which prove the effectiveness of <b>friction</b> <b>modifier</b> administered to the engine via the gasoline. A fuel economy improvement of approximately 2 % was seen where <b>friction</b> <b>modifier</b> gasoline was employed. Application of successful technology such as this is shown to correspond to the projected saving of around 502 million litres of gasoline and 388, 000 tonnes of carbon (C 02) per year in the UK alone.

The chemistry of the organic <b>friction</b> <b>modifier</b> employed affects the observed film forming properties and frictional behaviour.

40|$|Micropitting was studied using a three-contact disc machine {{having a}} central roller {{in contact with}} three harder, annular counter-discs (“rings”) of {{precisely}} controlled roughness. Roughness, running conditions, base stock and additive concentration were varied. The response of the same lubricants in a reciprocating sliding wear test operating in the boundary regime was also studied. It was reported in previous work that when a common antiwear additive, secondary zinc dialkyl-dithio-phosphate (ZDDP) is used in solution into a mineral oil, it provides enough protection to the rough surfaces leading to micropitting. In this work, different type of roughness finish, effect of lambda ratio on micropitting, effect of the antiwear concentration, {{as well as the}} effect of a <b>friction</b> <b>modifier</b> were studied. Results of experimental studies of the rolling contact behaviour of carburised steel rollers are reported. All the tests with the additive present led to micropitting. This being true for both longitudinal and transverse finish. However, transverse led to most severe case of micropitting wear. For different film thickness, micropitting was observed for various lambda ratio, however, micropitting wear was only observed for a calculated film thickness below 12 % of the centre-line average roughness of the rings. It was found that there was an approximately inverse correlation between the micropitting damage in the disc machine test and the mild wear in the reciprocating sliding test. The surface profiles were measured at given intervals during each test and the result confirmed that the nature of the antiwear additive slow-down the run-in of rough surfaces contributing to the onset of micropitting. Indeed, antiwear additives suppress the gradual smoothing of the rough surfaces, which takes place when a pure base stock is used under mild conditions. For cases closer to industry, it is common to use a combination of additives for various reasons. Indeed, antiwear and <b>friction</b> <b>modifier</b> additives are often used in formulated oils, a combination which leads to reduced boundary friction. The effect of the reduction of the friction at the asperity level was studied. A common <b>friction</b> <b>modifier</b> agent, commonly known as molybdenum dithio-carbamate (MoDTC), was added in solution to a mineral oil containing the antiwear additive. It was found that for the oil containing both ZDDP blended with MoDTC the surface of the tested roller exhibited micropitting wear. However, this micropitting wear gradually disappeared with continued running; {{this was not the case}} when the mineral oil was tested with ZDDP alone. The optical micrographs of the damaged surfaces showed that the subsurface cracks disappeared on the roller tested with ZDDP and MoDTC. After the test, further surface analysis of the counter-discs showed the presence of MoS 2 deposits on the asperity crests. The oil containing the <b>friction</b> <b>modifier</b> was tested using an MTM tribotester and this test confirmed the reduction in friction for a regime close to boundary lubrication. It is speculated that the improved micropitting behaviour resulted from the effect of a reduction in local tensile stress due to reduced asperity friction. This may have reduced the opening of the surface cracks and inhibited their extension. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
