40|$|The thesis studied tensile strength, <b>disintegration</b> time <b>of</b> tablets {{and energy}} profile of {{compression}} of agglomerated lactose Tablettose® 80 and of granulated lactose SuperTab® 30 GR. Tested parameters were studied depending on compression force, addition of two concentrations of the lubricant magnesium stearate (0. 5 and 1 %) and 25 % microcrystalline cellulose Microcel® MC- 200. The tablets were compressed using the material testing machine T 1 - FRO 50 TH. A 1 K Zwick/Roell. Used compression forces were 11, 13 and 15 kN, {{in the case}} of mixtures with Microcel® MC- 200 11 kN. Tensile strength of tablets increased with compression force at both lactoses and it was higher {{in the case of}} mixtures with SuperTab® 30 GR. Magnesium stearate decreased the tensile strength of tablets from Tablettose® 80 for all compression forces. Addition Microcel® MC- 200 increased the tensile strength of tablets from both lactoses, more in the case <b>of</b> Tablettose® 80. <b>Disintegration</b> time <b>of</b> tablets increased with compression force.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{design of}} {{pediatric}} formulations is challenging. Solid dosage forms for {{children have to}} meet the needs of different ages, e. g. high number of dosing increments and strengths. A modular formulation strategy offering the possibility of rapid prototyping was applied. Different tablet compositions and the resulting tablet characteristics were investigated for dispersible tablets using customized analytical methods. METHODS: Fluid bed granules were blended with extragranular components, and compressed to tablets. Disintegration behavior was studied with a Texture Analyzer and a Tensiometer. RESULTS: Methods for determination <b>of</b> <b>disintegration</b> time and water uptake of tablets were developed with a Texture Analyzer, and a Tensiometer, respectively. Twenty-two different tablet formulations were prepared and analyzed with respect to disintegration time, hardness, friability, and viscosity. Multivariate data analysis revealed a high impact of type and amount of viscosity enhancer on the <b>disintegration</b> behavior <b>of</b> tablets. An optimized formulation was selected with a <b>disintegration</b> time <b>of</b> 24 s. CONCLUSION: Methods providing additional information on the <b>disintegration</b> behavior <b>of</b> dispersible tablets compared to standard pharmacopoeia methods were established. Selecting the right type and level of viscosity enhancer and superdisintegrant was critical for developing pediatric tablets with a <b>disintegration</b> time <b>of</b> less than 30 s but still pleasant mouth feel...|$|R

5|$|As the society, Durkheim noted {{there are}} several {{possible}} pathologies {{that could lead to}} a breakdown of social integration and <b>disintegration</b> <b>of</b> the society: the two most important ones are anomie and forced division of labour; lesser ones include the lack of coordination and suicide. By anomie Durkheim means a state when too rapid population growth reduces the amount of interaction between various groups, which in turn leads to a breakdown of understanding (norms, values, and so on). By forced division of labour Durkheim means a situation where power holders, driven by their desire for profit (greed), results in people doing the work they are unsuited for. Such people are unhappy, and their desire to change the system can destabilize the society.|$|E
