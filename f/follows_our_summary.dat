40|$|The {{technical}} staffs of {{the state}} and federal and tribal fishery managers have attended the regional forum meetings at which the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) presented their “Summer Spill Analysis”. We have also reviewed the spreadsheet and power point slides that were posted on the TMT web site for the regional forum. The conclusions of our review are summarized in the following points. A detailed discussion of each point <b>follows</b> <b>our</b> <b>summary</b> conclusions. Conclusions · The “Summer Spill ” analysis has been presented verbally, with power point slides. A spreadsheet was posted. However, BPA has not prepared a written document explaining the analysis, hypothesis, assumptions, parameters and most importantly how technical comments regarding the limitations of the SIMPAS model, previously distributed from the fishery agencies and tribes, have been addressed in this analysis. The agencies and tribes have requested a written manuscript of this analysis, complete with assumptions and supportive data based upon the scientific literature and reserve the right to provide additional comments when the written document is provided. · The “Summer Spill Analysis ” is an inappropriate application of the SIMPAS model. The agencies and tribes have advised the region on several occasions regarding the limitations of the simple spreadsheet SIMPAS model. (see attached correspondence, Appendix A). SIMPAS ignores uncertainty and risk, and does not provide confidence intervals for each model parameter. The NOAA Biological Opinion specifically discusses the limitations of SIMPAS as it pertains to prediction of adult returns and delayed mortality. The BPA impact analysis results utilizing SIMPAS are highly uncertain and do not provide a robust foundation for fish passage management decisions...|$|E

The aim {{of this study is to}} create scenarios on how new information systems for improved road traffic can evolve. What are the driving forces? Who can act? Who can benefit? What are the social impacts? Through the use of a Delphi panel of professionals, researchers and informed generalists, we have gathered impulses for the scenarios on how information technology, communication means and control systems can reshape future road traffic. The issue studied is how this "Road Transport Informatics" (RTI) will evolve. A short history of road information systems is given and the problem formulation and methodology is discussed. A summary of panelists' responses on events, impacts, actors and barriers <b>follows.</b> <b>Our</b> <b>summaries</b> and conclusions on a possible RTI evolution are presented as scenario scenes for 1990, 1995, 2000, 2010, 2020 and 2040...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel {{approach}} that makes use of topic models based on Latent Dirichlet allocation(LDA) for generating single document <b>summaries.</b> <b>Our</b> approach is distinguished from other LDA based approaches in that we identify the summary topics which best describe a given document and only extract sentences from those paragraphs within the document which are highly correlated given the summary topics. This ensures that <b>our</b> <b>summaries</b> always highlight {{the crux of the}} document without paying any attention to the grammar and the structure of the documents.

A covariate-specific version of <b>our</b> <b>summary</b> index is developed, {{which can be used}} to assess the discrimination performance of a diagnostic test, conditionally on the value of a predictor. Nonparametric Bayes estimators for the proposed indexes are devised, theoretical properties of the corresponding priors are derived, and the performance of our methods is assessed through a simulation study.

40|$|Online Citizen Science {{platforms}} {{are good}} examples of socio-technical systems where technology-enabled interactions occur between scientists {{and the general public}} (volunteers). Citizen Science platforms usually host multiple Citizen Science projects, and allow volunteers to choose the ones to participate in. Recent work in the area has demonstrated a positive feedback loop between participation and learning and creativity in Citizen Science projects, {{which is one of the}} motivating factors both for scientists and the volunteers. This emphasises the importance of creating successful Citizen Science platforms, which support this feedback process, and enable enhanced learning and creativity to occur through knowledge sharing and diverse participation. In this paper, we discuss how scientists' and volunteers' motivation and participation influence the design of Citizen Science platforms. We present <b>our</b> <b>summary</b> as guidelines for designing these platforms as user-inspired socio-technical systems. We also present the case-studies on popular Citizen Science platforms, including our own CitizenGrid platform, developed as part of the CCL EU project, as well as Zooniverse, World Community Grid, CrowdCrafting and EpiCollect+ to see how closely these platforms <b>follow</b> <b>our</b> proposed guidelines and how these may be further improved to incorporate the creativity enabled by the collective knowledge sharing.

In this paper we develop a randomized online quantile summary for the cash register data input model and comparison data domain model that uses O((1 /epsilon) log(1 /epsilon)) words of memory. This improves upon the previous best upper bound of O((1 /epsilon) (log(1 /epsilon)) ^(3 / 2)) by Agarwal et al. (PODS 2012). Further, by a lower bound of Hung and Ting (FAW 2010) no deterministic summary for the comparison model can outperform <b>our</b> randomized <b>summary</b> in terms of space complexity.
