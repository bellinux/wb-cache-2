5|$|Despite being outnumbered {{and poorly}} equipped, certain Bulgarian units offered fierce resistance, delaying the Entente advance in Zborsko. However, the {{collapse}} of the front line enabled the Allies to assault Bulgarian positions from multiple <b>directions</b> <b>and</b> eventually quell the last pockets of resistance.

40|$|When the {{dependent}} (or response) variable response variable {{in an experiment}} has <b>direction</b> <b>and</b> magnitude, one approach {{that has been used}} for statistical analysis involves splitting magnitude <b>and</b> <b>direction</b> <b>and</b> applying univariate statistical techniques to the components. However, such treatment of quantities with <b>direction</b> <b>and</b> magnitude is not justifiable mathematically and can lead to incorrect conclusions about relationships among variables and, as a result, to flawed interpretations. This note discusses a problem with that practice and recommends mathematically correct procedures to be used with dependent variables that have <b>direction</b> <b>and</b> magnitude for 1) computation of mean values, 2) statistical contrasts of and confidence intervals for means, and 3) correlation methods...|$|R
5|$|In {{a school}} of Pacific blue-eyes that is threatened, a few {{individuals}} accelerate and change direction, which initiates an escape wave that spreads through the whole cohort. Animals are known to dart in random <b>directions</b> <b>and</b> speeds as an escape response when threatened. Pacific blue-eyes on their own dart in this manner for up to ten seconds after being faced with a threat at close range. This period is briefer when faced with more distant threats or for fish in schools.|$|E

5|$|The Maya {{viewed the}} cosmos as highly structured; there were {{thirteen}} {{levels in the}} heavens, and nine levels in the underworld; the mortal world occupied a position between the heavens and the underworld. Each level had four cardinal directions associated with a different colour.

Indra declares in chapter 90 of Devi Purana that the Matrikas are the best among all deities and should be worshipped in cities, villages, towns and shields. Matrikas are generally to be worshipped on all occasions with Navagraha (the nine planets) and the Dikpala (Guardians of the <b>directions)</b> <b>and</b> at night with the Goddess.|$|E

Brown fingerposts are used on sections that follow roads. The Way is typically completed in five to seven days.|$|E

5|$|The really curious part of {{this story}} is that, after {{everything}} had been explained, and all had been restored to their normal courses of action, none of the personages involved in it married each other.

5|$|Will (Matthew Morrison) and Shelby {{agree to}} hold a mash-up {{competition}} between the New <b>Directions</b> <b>and</b> the Troubletones. Santana (Naya Rivera) takes the rivalry very seriously, and taunts and derides her former New Directions teammates—particularly Finn. He challenges Santana and the other Troubletones to a game of dodgeball. Finn and Santana are the last two people standing, until Santana whips a ball at Finn's face, and wins the game. Despite having won, Santana violently targets Rory (Damian McGinty), and makes his nose bleed.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} {{a tropical storm}} on August30, the subtropical ridge caused Leslie to turn west-northwestward. By the early on August31, the storm featured well-define outflow in all <b>directions</b> <b>and</b> the center of circulation {{was close to the}} main area of convection. Intensity estimates around that time indicated sustained wind speeds of 70mph (110km/h). However, intensification halted later on August31 as wind shear increased over the storm, causing convection to become displaced from the center. Early on September1, an eye-like feature appeared on satellite imagery; however, there was uncertainty {{as to whether or not}} the feature was displaced from the low-level center. The storm became increasingly disorganized, with the circulation displaced from the main convective area several hours later.|$|E

5|$|As Tokyo Mew Mew {{became a}} viable project, Kodansha hired Reiko Yoshida {{to be the}} series' {{scenario}} writer and story supervisor. Yoshida and two other editors determined each volume's plot, created a scenario by adding stage <b>directions</b> <b>and</b> dialogue, and presented it to Ikumi. Ikumi added her own ideas and changes, creating the manuscript's first draft, which {{was taken to the}} publishers for final review and approval. This differs from most manga series, in which the manga writer also creates the scenarios and stories before submitting to their editor for approval.|$|E
5|$|Before being {{upgraded}} to a freeway between Britannia Boulevard and Siempre Viva Road, SR905 {{had a direct}} connection with SR 125 via two at-grade intersections on Otay Mesa Road. When that segment of the SR905 freeway was opened in 2010, the interchange with SR125 had initially been omitted, forcing traffic on SR905 and SR125 to exit their respective freeways and use Otay Mesa Road (which continues to parallel SR905) to make the connection. To help fix this problem, ramps from SR905 in both <b>directions</b> <b>and</b> SR11 westbound to SR125 northbound were completed on November 30, 2016, {{at a cost of}} over $21 million. Southbound traffic on SR125 must currently still exit to Otay Mesa Road at that toll road's south end in order to connect to SR905, but the southbound ramps are scheduled to begin construction in 2018.|$|E
5|$|Between May 29 and June 2, the Israel Defense Forces {{constantly}} bombarded the Egyptians in Isdud with Napoleonchik cannons and Givati patrols harassed the Egyptian lines.

The 3rd Company of the 53rd Battalion, commanded by Yosef Geva, was tasked with harassing the enemy lines, while the 1st Company of the 54th Battalion, commanded by Aryeh Kotzer, was ordered to assault several targets. In his book In the Fields of Philistia, Uri Avnery, {{who participated in the}} battles, wrote of the harassment operation that during those days the Egyptians were fearing an Israeli attack and were firing in all <b>directions</b> <b>and</b> launching flares in hopes of discovering their enemy.|$|E
