5|$|Amanita rubrovoltata {{mushrooms}} grow {{in groups}} on the ground. Amanita species form mycorrhizal relationships with trees. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. The original Japanese collections were made in forests dominated by Japanese beech (<b>Fagus</b> crenata), {{but it has also}} been found growing near Quercus luecotrichophora, Rhododendron arboreum, and Myrica esculenta in India, in Castanopsis-Schima forest in Nepal, and in Castanopsis indica plantations in the Himalayas.|$|E

5|$|Lactarius blennius is {{very common}} and is found in {{broad-leaved}} woodland, favouring beech; it is most associated with <b>Fagus</b> sylvatica, the European Beech, though {{it has also been}} observed growing in association with species of oak. It forms an ectomycorrhizal association with trees, and can grow {{on a wide variety of}} subsoil types, but is more typical of acidic soil. It is found between late summer and late autumn, and is native to Europe. The distribution of the mushroom coincides with the distribution of beech. In the British Isles, the species is one of the one hundred most common mushrooms. Other areas in which it has been recorded include Sweden, France, Italy, and Poland.|$|E
5|$|Russula densifolia is a {{mycorrhizal}} species. Descriptions {{have been}} published of the morphology of the ectomycorrhizae that it forms with European beech (<b>Fagus</b> sylvatica), and Norway spruce (Picea abies).

Hipparchia geneva/hermione have 7-12 black batons. Hipparchia <b>fagi</b> from 2 to 4, Hipparchia alcyone from 15 to 25.|$|R
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Pulveroboletus ravenelii grow {{on the ground}} singly, scattered, or in groups in woods under conifers. Preferred {{mycorrhizal}} plant hosts include pine, hemlock, and rhododendron. Fruiting occurs from July to October. In North America, it is distributed from eastern Canada extending south to the Gulf of Mexico, and west to Texas, Michigan, and California. The bolete was reported from a Mexican beech (<b>Fagus</b> mexicana) forest in Hidalgo, Mexico in 2010. It has also been recorded from Costa Rica and Colombia. In Asia, {{it has been found}} in Indonesia and China. It has also been recorded from northeast Australia.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Sutorius eximius {{grow in the}} soil singly or {{scattered}} among leaf litter. A mycorrhizal species, the bolete has been recorded growing in association with plants from various genera, including Dicymbe, Dipterocarpus, <b>Fagus,</b> Hopea, Quercus, Shorea, and Tsuga. The species has been recorded from North America, Costa Rica, and Indonesia. In Costa Rica, where it usually associates with the endemic oaks Quercus seemannii and Q.copeyensis, the lilac-brown bolete can be locally abundant in the Cordillera Central and the Cordillera de Talamanca. Additional locations with collections {{that have not been}} confirmed by DNA analysis include Guyana, Japan, China. Although S.eximius has been reported from Thailand, molecular analysis of Thai collections suggests that they represent a distinct, as-yet unnamed species.|$|E
5|$|Russula virescens can {{be found}} fruiting on soil in both {{deciduous}} forests and mixed forests, forming ectomycorrhizal symbiotic relationships {{with a variety of}} trees, including oaks (Quercus), European beech (<b>Fagus</b> sylvatica), and aspen (Populus tremula). Preliminary investigations suggest that the fungus also associates with at least ten species of Dipterocarpaceae, an important tree family prevalent in the tropical lowland forests of Southeast Asia. Fruit bodies may appear singly or in groups, reappear in the same spots year after year, and are not common. In Europe, fruiting occurs mainly during the months of summer to early autumn. A Mexican study of the seasonal occurrence of several common mushroom species in subtropical forests in Xalapa showed that the fruiting period of R.virescens occurred in April, before the onset of the rainy season.|$|E
40|$|Apparent competition, {{through the}} action of shared natural enemies, is {{frequently}} suggested as a possible mechanism underlying the impact of invasive alien species on native species, but examples are rare, particularly in insects. A previous study showed that the beech leaf mining weevil, Orchestes <b>fagi,</b> was significantly less abundant close to horse-chestnut trees infested by the invasive horse-chestnut leaf mining moth, Cameraria ohridella, compared to control sites. Apparent competition through the sharing of natural enemies was proposed as a potential mechanism underlying this effect. To test the occurrence of apparent competition between the two leaf miner species, three observational studies and one experimental manipulation were carried out in Switzerland during 3 years. The total mortality, parasitism, predation and parasitoid diversity of larvae and pupae of O. <b>fagi</b> were compared between sites with and without horse-chestnut trees severely attacked by C. ohridella. Total mortality and predation rates of O. <b>fagi</b> {{were not significantly different}} between sites with and sites without C. ohridella. Despite a large overlap between the parasitoid complexes of the two leaf miners, parasitism of O. <b>fagi</b> was found to be positively influenced by the presence of horse-chestnuts infested by C. ohridella in only one of the four studies and only for 1 year. Similarly, parasitoid diversity was not higher near infested horse-chestnut trees compared to control sites. Thus, little evidence for apparent competition was found. Possible reasons, including possible insufficiencies in the experimental circumstances and design, are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Ophiostoma quercus is a morphologically vari-able {{species that}} causes {{sapstain}} on mostly hardwood hosts worldwide. Several {{species have been}} suggested as syno-nyms of O. quercus in the past, including O. <b>fagi,</b> O. roboris, O. valachicum, O. kubanicum, and O. catonianum. A recent collection of isolates resembling O. quercus from Azerbaijan provided the opportunity to reconsider the accuracy of these synonymies based on morphology and DNA sequence data. Four gene regions, the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer regions including the 5. 8 s gene, part of the β-tubulin gene, translation elongation factor- 1 α, and histone gene, {{were used to determine}} the phylogenetic relationships between the various species and isolates of different origin. In all four resulting phylogenetic trees, isolates of O. quercus, O. <b>fagi,</b> and O. roboris formed a single, well-supported cluster, but with some internal variation. All the other species in the analyses, including O. piceae and O. catonianum, grouped distinctly with good node support. These results thus support the synonymy of O. <b>fagi</b> and O. roboris with O. quercus, and confirm that O. piceae and O. catonianum are distinct taxa. Ophiostoma valachicum and O. kubanicum could not be considered due to the absence of cultures, but based on published descriptions, we argue that O. valachicum should be regarded as a valid species in need of neotypification. Ophiostoma kubanicum was never validly described and should be excluded from the list of synonyms of O. quercus...|$|R
