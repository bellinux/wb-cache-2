Gravel was the chief architect {{of the law that}} created a regional high school system for rural Alaska; this allowed Alaska Natives to attend schools near where they lived, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> go to schools run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the lower 48 states.|$|E
5|$|The {{casting process}} for Monica Reyes was unconventional. Gish {{received}} a call from her agent, who informed her that The X-Files were looking for a new female character. Gish applied for the part, but <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> a do a reading, she only had to meet with Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz. After receiving the part, Gish's first shot was scheduled four in the morning; her first scene in the episode was to run down a hill to discover a former abductee.|$|E
5|$|A {{roof was}} {{restored}} to the Main Stand by 1951 and, soon after, the three remaining stands were covered, the operation culminating {{with the addition of}} a roof to the Stretford End (now the West Stand) in 1959. The club also invested £40,000 in the installation of proper floodlighting, so that they would be able to use the stadium for the European games that were played in the late evening of weekdays, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> play at Maine Road. In order to avoid obtrusive shadows being cast on the pitch, two sections of the Main Stand roof were cut away. The first match to be played under floodlights at Old Trafford was a First Division match between Manchester United and Bolton Wanderers on 25 March 1957.|$|E

5|$|Revelation {{features}} several gameplay enhancements {{that aid}} puzzle solving and plot progression. Early in the game, players receive a camera, {{which can be}} used to take screenshots or pictures of clues. Players can use an on-screen journal to jot down notes <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> write down clues as with previous Myst games. Much of the game's story is revealed via flashbacks triggered by an amulet that has the power to relay memories attached to objects. Zip mode, the amulet, the camera, and the journal are available via a menu {{on the bottom of the}} game screen.|$|E
5|$|The BBC regime brought {{immediate}} benefits. The use of {{the second}} half of concerts to promote Chappell's songs ceased, to be replaced by music chosen for its own excellence: on the first night under the BBC's control, the songs in the second half were by Schubert, Quilter and Parry rather than ballads from Chappell's. For Wood, the greatest benefit was that the BBC gave him twice as much rehearsal time as he had previously enjoyed. He now had a daily rehearsal and extra rehearsals as needed. He was also allowed extra players when large scores called for them, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> rescore the work for the forces available.|$|E
5|$|Grim Fandango mixed static pre-rendered {{background}} {{images with}} 3D characters and objects. Part {{of this decision}} was based on how the calaca figures would appear in three dimensions. There were more than 90 sets and 50 characters in the game to be created and rendered; Manny's character alone comprised 250 polygons. The development team found that by utilizing three-dimensional models to pre-render the backgrounds, they could alter the camera shot to achieve more effective or dramatic angles for certain scenes simply by re-rendering the background, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> have an artist redraw the background for a traditional 2D adventure game. The team adapted the engine to allow Manny's head to move separately from his body to make the player aware of important objects nearby. The 3D engine also aided in the choreography between the spoken dialog and body and arm movements of the characters. Additionally, full motion video cutscenes were incorporated to advance the plot, using the same in-game style for the characters and backgrounds to make them nearly indistinguishable from the actual game.|$|E

50|$|However, {{the plan}} quickly goes awry: the ship Napoleon is serving on {{abruptly}} changes its itinerary and docks in Belgium <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> France. <b>Having</b> <b>to</b> {{make his way}} to France by land (and gaining an appalling look at the tourist trap the Battlefield <b>of</b> Waterloo <b>has</b> become), he is finally met at the French border by a loyal agent, Sgt. Bommell (Clive Russell), formerly of the French Imperial Guard. Bommell gives him the name of another agent in Paris he can trust, Lt. Truchaut.|$|R
5|$|In 1927, Beebe went on an {{expedition}} to Haiti in order to document its marine life. Anchoring his ship the Lieutenant in the harbor of Port-au-Prince, he performed over 300 helmet dives examining the area's coral reefs and classifying the fish that inhabited them. These dives involved several technological innovations: a watertight brass box {{which could be used}} to house a camera for underwater photography, and a telephone which was incorporated into the diving helmet, allowing the diver to dictate observations to someone on the surface <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> take notes underwater. Within a hundred days, Beebe and his team had created a catalog of species inhabiting the area nearly as long as what had been assembled on the neighboring island of Puerto Rico in the past four hundred years. In 1928 Beebe and Tee-Van published an illustrated and annotated list of 270 such species, which was expanded in 1935 bringing the total to 324. Beebe provided an account of this expedition in his 1928 book Beneath Tropic Seas, which was the first of his books to receive less than enthusiastic reviews, due to its episodic structure.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{expand on}} their debut's sound, the xx wanted to {{minimise}} the songs they recorded for Coexist and mute certain elements during its production. Croft {{felt that this}} would help make the music more playable live <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> reproduce multiple vocal or guitar elements that were tracked onto a song. Smith, who produced and mixed Coexist, wanted to keep his production simple and create an emotive, electronic sound. He used Logic Pro recording software, a Space Echo effects unit, preamplifiers, and Casiotones on occasion, as well as both synthesised steelpan sounds and live percussion instruments. To engineer the album, he put together a mixing desk from pieces of other desks and left doors open during the recording to let sounds from outside the studio bleed into the mix. The xx finished recording Coexist in May 2012.|$|E

5|$|Dynasty Warriors 4 expands on its {{predecessors}} by adding new characters, new modes {{of play and}} a completely new 'Edit Mode.' <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> strict routines <b>to</b> follow during battle, officers, to some extent, will have a greater reaction to the events taking place on the battlefield {{in the game and}} may react to things more often.|$|R
30|$|The {{present study}} has {{investigated}} {{the utility of}} the M-BLEA in a real-world setting involving expensive simulation-based function evaluations. With regard to future works, we will focus on further improving the algorithm to tackle real-time bi-level optimization problems, such as those occurring in security games. One possible means of achieving further speed up of the M-BLEA is the incorporation of quadratic approximation models (or other surrogate modeling techniques) at the lower level, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> repeatedly <b>having</b> <b>to</b> solve the lower level optimization task in an evolutionary manner, as has very recently been proposed in [28].|$|R
25|$|Negation Theory {{contends that}} the {{negative}} need only negate the affirmative <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> negate the resolution.

25|$|Haaretz {{reported}} in March 2007 that Prime Minister Ehud Olmert {{testified to the}} Winograd Commission that several meetings regarding Hezbollah were held upon his taking office, and that {{in response to the}} likely scenario of soldiers again being abducted, he chose one of several plans of action <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> make a snap-judgement if and when such a scenario occurred.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the station}} was built on a {{confined}} site, it was equipped with two electrically operated traversers at the buffer end of the platforms as a space saving measure, {{in order to allow}} locomotives to move sideways between tracks, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> reverse through crossovers. The traversers were removed from service in 1967, when all services to the station switched to diesel multiple unit operation.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the fuel}} {{continued}} to leak, {{with the fire}} out the plane was now safe. His crawl back over the wing, {{in which he had}} previously torn holes, was more dangerous than the outward journey but he managed {{with the help of the}} aircraft's navigator. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> the crew <b>having</b> <b>to</b> bail out, the aircraft made an emergency landing at Newmarket, United Kingdom.|$|R
50|$|Another set {{of level}} choices in Combat were the Biplanes. Unlike the Tank version, this was played with {{three types of}} firing shots (straight-missile, guided missile, and machine guns). However, there were several {{different}} gameplay modes. Players <b>had</b> the option <b>of</b> fighting one on one, <b>having</b> a pair <b>of</b> Biplanes each that moved and fired in tandem, or have one player control three tandem Biplanes against one large Bomber. The Bomber's shot was an oversized projectile that otherwise behaved as a straight-missile. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> mazes <b>to</b> fly through, there were two clouds {{in the middle of}} the stage that either player could fly into temporarily hiding them from view of the other player.|$|R

In both cases, the gunners rode into action while sitting on the limbers <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> walk beside the guns. A battery was established as having four cannons and two howitzers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—An {{efficient}} initial approximation {{method for}} multiplicative division and square root is proposed. It is {{a modification of}} the piecewise linear approximation. The multiplication and the addition required for the linear approximation are replaced by only one multiplication with a slight modification of the operand. The same accuracy is achieved. The modification of the operand requires only a bit-wise inversion and a one-bit shift, and can be implemented by a very simple circuit. One clock cycle may be saved, because the addition is removed. The required table size is also reduced, because only one coefficient <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> two <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be stored. Index Terms—Computer arithmetic, division, initial approximation, linear approximation, reciprocal, square root. ...|$|R

25|$|The tubing {{from the}} bag of fluid being {{administered}} that connects to directly to the patient is called the primary tubing. Any additional IVs to be administered {{are connected to the}} primary tubing and are called secondary IV, or IV piggyback <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> place multiple catheters in the patient. When administering a secondary IV medication, the primary bag is held lower than the secondary bag so that the secondary medication can flow into the primary tubing rather than fluid from the primary bag flowing into the secondary tubing. The fluid from the primary bag is needed to help flush any remaining medication from the secondary IV from the tubing into the patient.|$|E
25|$|The Brachiosauridae are {{composed}} of quadrupedal dinosaurs that are generally very large, {{with the exception of}} the possible insular dwarf Europasaurus. The brachiosaurids can be distinguished from other macronarian taxa by their broad, thick and spoon-shaped teeth. Their maxillary teeth were twisted apically, at the top, and the shape of these teeth was optimal for biting off resistant vegetation. While brachiosaurids, like other sauropods, did not perform significant food processing in their mouths, their teeth enabled them to slice through food <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> pull it off of tree branches. Evidence for this precision shearing consists of apical wear facets on the teeth and distinctive bone structure that suggests orthal, vertical, jaw action.|$|E
50|$|As with {{previous}} World Cups, {{the rules of}} the qualification rounds were quite confusing.
