5|$|This strong odour can be {{detected}} <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>away</b> by animals, thus luring them. In addition, the fruit is extremely appetising {{to a variety of}} animals, including squirrels, mouse deer, pigs, orangutan, elephants, and even carnivorous tigers. While some of these animals eat the fruit and dispose of the seed under the parent plant, others swallow the seed with the fruit and then transport it some distance before excreting, with the seed being dispersed as a result. The thorny, armoured covering of the fruit discourages smaller animals; larger animals are more likely to transport the seeds far from the parent tree.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry between}} West Ham and Millwall has {{involved}} considerable violence {{and is one}} of the most notorious within the world of football hooliganism. The teams were drawn against each other in the second round of the 2009–10 League Cup and met on 25 August 2009 at Upton Park. This was the first time in four years that the two clubs had played each other, and the first ever in the League Cup. Clashes between fans occurred outside the ground, resulting in violence erupting up to <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>away</b> from the stadium, with serious injuries, include the stabbing of a Millwall supporter, damage to property and several arrests reported by police. There were also several pitch invasions by West Ham supporters which brought a temporary halt to the game. In January 2010, West Ham were fined after being found guilty of violent, threatening, obscene and provocative behaviour and of failing to prevent their fans entering the field of play. Millwall were cleared of all charges.|$|E

5|$|On a cold, snowy day, thirteen-year-old Lad feels snubbed {{when the}} three-year-old Wolf does not {{invite him to}} join him and Rex, a five-year-old collie and bull terrier mix, for a run in the woods. Later, Lad goes for a walk, {{following}} their path. When he meets them on the trail, rather than letting Lad pass, Rex viciously attacks him. With his teeth dulled by old age, Lad is unable to really fight back. Refusing to just run, he defends himself as best he can while moving backwards towards home, <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>away.</b> Though Wolf betrays him and joins Rex in the life-or-death fight, Lad manages to {{get close enough to}} the house for Bruce to hear the battle and alert the Master and Mistress. The Master is forced to kill Rex after the crazed dog turns on him. After four weeks recovering from his wounds, Lad is able to go outside again and Wolf steps aside for him, acknowledging he is still the leader of the Place's dogs.|$|E

25|$|Just {{before the}} start of the match, after the Scottish team had spent a night at a youth hostel, the Irish Rugby Football Union {{prevented}} the teams from getting changed at the arranged Blackrook College.

25|$|Much {{of what we}} {{know about}} the site is due to the large number of altars, {{dedication}} slabs and a milestone dedicated to emperor Gordian III found <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>away</b> from the fort on the path of Dere Street. Gods worshipped include traditional Roman deities such as Jupiter, Mars, Mercury and Silvanus and Celtic and Germanic ones such as Garmangabis.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1760s, Madison, Sr. {{built a new}} house <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>away,</b> which {{structure}} forms {{the heart of the}} main house at Montpelier today. Built around 1764, it has two stories of brick laid in a Flemish bond pattern, and a low, hipped roof with chimney stacks at both ends. His son James Madison later stated that he remembered helping move furniture to the new home. The building of Montpelier represents Phase 1 (1764–1797) of the construction. Upon completion, the Madisons owned one of the largest brick dwellings in Orange County.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} railway in Britain was a wagonway system, a {{horse drawn}} wooden rail system, used by German miners at Caldbeck, Cumbria, England, perhaps from the 1560s.. A wagonway was built at Prescot, near Liverpool, sometime around 1600, possibly {{as early as}} 1594. Owned by Philip Layton, the line carried coal from a pit near Prescot Hall to a terminus about <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>away.</b> On 26 July 1803, Jessop opened the Surrey Iron Railway, south of London erroneously considered first railway in Britain, also a horse-drawn one. It was not a railway in the modern sense of the word, as it functioned like a turnpike road. There were no official services, as anyone could bring a vehicle on the railway by paying a toll.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, the pub's {{name was}} changed to Crocker's Folly, which had been its {{nickname}} for many years. The story was that Frank Crocker, believing he had a reliable tip-off about {{the site of the}} new terminus of the Great Central Railway, built the pub on a lavish scale to serve it, but that when the terminus was actually built {{it turned out to be}} over <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>away</b> at Marylebone Station – leading to Crocker's ruin, despair and eventual suicide, jumping from the window of an upper floor. In reality, Crocker did die in 1904, aged only 41, but of natural causes, although the subsequent landlord, Charles Durden, did kill himself in the way described. It has been claimed that Crocker's ghost haunts the pub.|$|E
25|$|John {{had persuaded}} Helen to leave Alapaevsk {{and go back}} to their two young children, whom she had left with John's mother, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Mavrikievna of Russia. In June 1918, Helen visited the Ipatiev House and demanded to see the tsar, {{secretly}} hoping to pass on letters to the imperial family from their relatives. After being refused entry by the guards (who had their rifles aimed at her), she went to the Amerikanskaya Hotel <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>away,</b> making repeated enquiries to the Cheka. She was however arrested by the secret police and imprisoned herself in Perm. The following month, in July 1918, her husband John and several other captive members of the imperial family were killed by the Bolsheviks.|$|E

25|$|The attackers {{then moved}} on to the Emmett mine, about <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>away</b> and outside of town, where in {{addition}} to dynamite and gunfire, they used a home-made cannon to fire shrapnel at the shaft house. The cannon blew a hole in the defensive wall, and the attackers tried to rush through the breach, but were driven back by gunfire from the strikebreakers. The attackers again tried to rupture the boiler fuel tank at the Emmett, but without success. The attackers finally withdrew, leaving one of their number at the scene, killed by gunfire. The El Paso, and R.A.M. mines were also attacked that night, but without casualties or damage. All four of the attackers who died were identified as members of the Western Federation of Miners.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{references}} to {{their use in}} central Europe in the 16th century. Such a transport system was later used by German miners at Caldbeck, Cumbria, England, perhaps from the 1560s. A wagonway was built at Prescot, near Liverpool, sometime around 1600, possibly as early as 1594. Owned by Philip Layton, the line carried coal from a pit near Prescot Hall to a terminus about <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>away.</b> A funicular railway was also made at Broseley in Shropshire some time before 1604. This carried coal for James Clifford from his mines {{down to the river}} Severn to be loaded onto barges and carried to riverside towns. The Wollaton Wagonway, completed in 1604 by Huntingdon Beaumont, has sometimes erroneously been cited as the earliest British railway. It ran from Strelley to Wollaton near Nottingham.|$|E
25|$|The Belfast Metropolitan Area Plan 2015 {{identifies}} {{the need to}} improve transport links to George Best Belfast City Airport from the city centre. The BMAP proposed a light rail line from the city centre that would have interchanged with a new railway station at Tillysburn, serving both the airport and the Holywood Exchange retail development. However, in April 2008 the decision was taken not to proceed with the light rail project, with the DRD choosing to implement a new bus-based network. The pressure group Rail 21 has stated that the Tillysburn proposal is insufficient for what the new station is expected to provide – a link to the airport, transport provision for Holywood Exchange and a park and ride facility. Instead it proposes a dedicated airport station, similar to , connected directly to the terminal, with Tillysburn <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>away</b> serving Holywood Exchange, instead of Tillysburn providing the link to the airport.|$|E
