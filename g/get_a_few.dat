At Evansville he was an All-American twotimes but had to transfer due to the school dropping football as a sport.

25|$|Starting {{with the}} October 24, 1937 radio show, where Jack proudly {{announced}} {{the purchase of}} his car, a running joke was that Benny drove an old Maxwell automobile, a brand that {{went out of business}} in 1925. Although some details such as the car's body style and its exact model year would vary over the years, what remained constant was that Benny's old car was so worn out that it would barely run, but the miserly Benny insisted he could <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more miles out of it. Many of the sound effects for the car’s clattering engine came from an actual old motor which the sound effects shop had salvaged from a Los Angeles junkyard. When a sound effects man missed a cue for the automobile engine, Mel Blanc quickly improvised a vocal imitation of a sputtering car engine starting up noisily that was so funny it became a regular feature of the show.|$|E

Although stand-in captain Clarke mirrored the action of Ponting by bringing himself on before the Victoria captain, White claimed a career-best three wickets for five runs off the 10balls he bowled. After the match, White admitted he had to prove he could deal with the pressures of international cricket, but was upbeat, saying [...] "it was nice to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> wickets {{but it would have}} been nice to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> overs under the belt as well." [...] He claimed two more wickets in the second match and, after not being required to bowl in the third, finished the series with an average under 10.|$|E

500|$|The Boy Next Door {{received}} generally negative {{reviews from}} film critics, {{who felt that}} it promised [...] "campy thrills" [...] but did not deliver. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 10%, based on 115 reviews, with a rating average of 3.3/10. The site's consensus reads: [...] "The Boy Next Door may <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> howls out of [...] fans of stalker thrillers, but for most [...] viewers, it won't even rise to 'so bad it's good' status."

500|$|The ending was {{altered by}} the writers; the protagonist chooses a {{completely}} different girl in the film {{than the one he}} selects in the novel. Rye was concerned about the reactions of viewers who had read the novel, and it took Gowariker a while to convince him to agree. The writers were highly impressed and relieved by the characters' fine detailing in the novel, adding: [...] "The written matter was very strong and we had to just <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> layers on that." [...] While writing the screenplay, Mehta and Gowariker decided to have one song for each zodiac sign to bring out the personality of each sign and its related girl. They had to write each character with different nuances. The title of the film is taken from a fictional book, What's Your Raashee?, about the compatibility between the sun signs, which the protagonist reads in the film.|$|E

500|$|With his {{aggressive}} running style which favored {{running over}} players instead of around them, questions began to arise over how long Campbell could stay healthy. [...] "He runs {{with a lot}} of reckless abandon," [...] said Ron Johnson, a former running back whose own career was cut short. [...] "You can run like that in college. But you can't do that for 10 years and hope to survive." [...] Pittsburgh Steelers running back Franco Harris said [...] "Knocking over people can look very good but you can't do it forever. Sometimes it's going to be somebody else who knocks you over ... so the most important thing I think isn't to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> extra yards every time but to make sure you're healthy enough to play." [...] Bum Phillips, though, favored Campbell's running style. [...] "I've been looking for a back like Earl," [...] he said. [...] "I'm not going to change his style. Why would I? You don't want a guy who gets hit and then flops on the ground. Earl does the same thing other backs do, only better." ...|$|E

500|$|There was {{debate about}} {{the merits of the}} producer's {{decision}} to avoid depicting the two battles between the Starks and Lannisters. Ryan criticized it and confessed being [...] "a little disappointed that many of the major characters are caught up in a war and we're not seeing it." [...] Sims regretted not seeing the fight, and although he claimed to understand the budget constrictions, he felt that [...] "all this off-screen fighting is just getting my blood rushing for some on-screen fighting." [...] Sepinwall concludes: [...] "Ideally, we'd <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> epic, Braveheart-level battle scenes at some point, but I also respect the demands of time and budget here. Those kinds of sequences cost a fortune, and they eat up a lot of screen time, and I think ultimately I'd have rather had the time, say, that we spent in Tyrion's tent the night before the battle, with the mortifying story of his ex-wife, and then whatever it cost to make the execution sequence look as good as it did, than for the episode to have given us one or two long fight scenes." ...|$|E

[...] Alex Easton of AltSounds called the show [...] "emotional, powerful and stunning."

500|$|Casting for {{the film}} became a hot topic. When Sean Penn met Malick, he told him, [...] "Give me a dollar and tell me where to show up". Scripts were also sent to Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall and Tom Cruise. In 1995, once word went out that Malick was making another movie after many years, {{numerous}} actors approached him, flooding the casting directors until they had to announce they wouldn't be accepting more requests. Some A-list actors including Brad Pitt, Al Pacino, Gary Oldman, and George Clooney offered {{to work for a}} fraction and some even offered to work for free. Bruce Willis even went as far as offering to pay for first-class tickets for the casting crew, to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> lines for the movie. At Medavoy's home in 1995, Malick staged a reading with Martin Sheen delivering the screen directions, and Kevin Costner, Will Patton, Peter Berg, Lukas Haas, and Dermot Mulroney playing the main roles. In June of that year, a five-day workshop was scheduled at Medavoy's with Pitt dropping by, and culminating with Malick putting on the soundtrack of Where Eagles Dare and playing Japanese taiko drums. Malick met with an interested Johnny Depp about the project at the Book Soup Bistro on the Sunset Strip.|$|E

500|$|Ferret-legging {{has existed}} for centuries, but the sport made a brief {{resurgence}} in popularity during the 1970s. According to a 2005 report published in the English Northern Echo newspaper, whether due to a [...] "lack of brave contestants or complaining wives", ferret-legging is now [...] "a dying sport" [...] that is being replaced by ferret racing, in which the animals race through a plastic pipe. Although the sport is now uncommon, annual competitions were held at the Richmond Highland Games & Celtic Festival in Richmond, Virginia from 2003 through 2009. In 2007 the Manitoba Ferret Association held a ferret-legging competition in St. Vital Park, Winnipeg, to raise money {{in support of the}} organization's shelter for homeless ferrets. Marlene Blackburn, who works with the Ferret Rescue League to ensure that no ferrets are harmed in the sport, claims that during the years the competitions have been held in Richmond no contestant has ever been bitten, although some may <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> scratches. According to Kelly Yager of the Manitoba Ferret Association, the animals actually like small, confined spaces. Jay Lugar, spokesman for the Richmond Highland Games & Celtic Festival, said ferrets are [...] "generally very harmless, fun-loving creatures." [...] Reg Mellor, however, commented that at their very worst, they can be [...] "cannibals, things that live only to kill, that'll eat your eyes out to get at your brain".|$|E
500|$|Lofton {{was again}} on the move when on December 23, 2003, the New York Yankees signed him to a two-year, $6.2 million contract. During a Yankees' road game at Cleveland, Lofton {{recorded}} his 2,000th career hit. After Lofton's single, Indians fans began an ovation in honor of Lofton. [...] "I didn't know what to expect. I figured I'd <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> claps. It was touching. I tipped my hat, but they just kept going. If there was a storybook {{way for me to}} get it, to get it in Cleveland, it was something to remember." [...] New York finished the regular season with an AL-best record, 10161. To begin the post-season, the Yankees defeated the Minnesota Twins, three games to one, in the 2004 ALDS. In the 2004 ALCS against the Boston Red Sox, the Yankees had built a 20 series lead when Lofton stated, [...] "My ultimate goal is for me to try to win a championship. I'm at a point in my career [...] I've been here for 13 years, and gotten close. This is an opportunity for me to have a chance at it again." [...] Then Yankees would go up in the series three games to none before becoming the first team in MLB history to lose a series after holding a 30 series.|$|E

Lost show runner Damon Lindelof said the fifth season of the show has [...] "flung major characters across decades, leaving them — and the audience — feverishly attempting to keep events straight and the end game in sight." [...] In [...] "The Variable", the viewers would <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more pieces of the puzzle, Lindelof said, and added: [...] "We're not promising any big whiz-bang flash pyrotechnics, but it does serve as a companion piece to another memorable episode, last season's 'The Constant', in which Desmond endured vicious, turbulence-caused side effects from traveling in time." [...] Lindelof also commented that the fifth season is about the rules of time travel as explained by Daniel, and said, [...] "We've never done a flashback story for Daniel, so he's very mysterious. Some of those mysteries will be answered in this episode." [...] Since Lindelof and his show runner partner Carlton Cuse wrote [...] "The Constant", they thought the [...] "sister episode" [...] should be written by someone other than them, which led to Kitsis and Horowitz writing it. The two show runners were pleased with the outcome of the episode. Cuse thought {{it was one of the}} best episodes of the season.|$|E

[...] New York writer Michael Tedder complimented the writers for improving on the first half of the season and wrote that the episode felt more [...] "tightly written". He also complimented Krasinski's [...] "understated" [...] performance as well as Wilson's acting, citing the scene near the end of the episode wherein Dwight learns Angela's baby might be his.
