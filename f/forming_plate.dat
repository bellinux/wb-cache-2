50|$|The EL34 is a pentode, {{while the}} 6L6, which {{delivers}} a similar {{range of power}} output, is a beam tetrode which RCA {{referred to as a}} beam power tube. Although power pentodes and beam tetrodes have some differences in their principles of operation (the beam forming plates of the beam tetrode or fifth electrode (3rd grid) of the pentode, both serving to hinder the return of unabsorbed electrons from the anode (or plate) to the 4th electrode (2nd grid)) and have some internal construction differences, they are functionally closely equivalent. Unlike the 6L6, (EIA base 7AC) the EL34 has its grid 3 connection brought out to a separate Pin (Pin 1) (EIA base 8ET) and its heater draws 1.5 Amps compared to the 0.9 Amp heater in the 6L6. However, Sylvania (and possibly GE) marketed a tube as 6CA7 which was not only in a markedly different 'fat boy' envelope, but used a beam <b>forming</b> <b>plate</b> much like a 6L6. Examining the mica spacer {{on the top of the}} tube will confirm the lack of a suppressor grid. Although these tubes have similar (but not identical) characteristics, they are made very differently.|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been clear that the cell plate formed during {{cytokinesis}} in most plant cells results from coalescence of small vesicles. It {{has been suggested that}} the origin of these vesicles is the Golgi apparatus. The repeated observations of the ill defined cytokinesis structure called the phragmoplast (see Sharp, 1943) suggest the involvement of some organelle. The Golgi apparatus grouped at the periphery of the cell plate may well be the phragmoplast (Fig. 1 a). In the maize (Zea mays L.) root one of the conspicuous features of telophase cells in which cell plate formation has begun is the association with the <b>forming</b> <b>plate</b> of partially oriented Golgi apparatus with each of which there appear numerou...|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} approach {{based on the}} density functional theory and the pseudopotential method was applied to consider diffusion and accumulation of Au, Pt, and Pd in graphite. It is shown that Pt atoms migrate easily inside graphite. They can stop at structure defects and accumulate there, attracting each other and <b>forming</b> <b>plate</b> clusters. Atoms of gold do not penetrate into graphite but link with edge atoms of broken graphite crystallites, forming three-dimensional metallic particles. Palladium behavior is intermediate between platinum and gold. Addition of silicon into graphite can promote the extraction of noble metals because Si atoms force out Pt, Pd, and Au atoms from their bonded states. Last effect {{can be used as}} a mechanism of striking off metals from graphite and their extraction from shale...|$|E

40|$|Cytokinesis in a {{plant cell}} is {{accomplished}} by {{the formation of a}} cell plate {{in the center of the}} phragmoplast. Little is known of the molecular events associated with this process. In this study, we report the identification of a dynamin-like protein from soybean and demonstrate that this protein is associated with the formation of the cell plate. Plant dynamin-like (PDL) protein contains 610 amino acids showing high homology with other members of the dynamin protein family. Western blot experiments demonstrated that it is associated with the non-ionic detergent-resistant fraction of membranes. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy localized PDL to the cell plate in dividing soybean root tip cells. Double labeling experiments demonstrated that, unlike phragmoplast microtubules which are concentrated on the periphery of the <b>forming</b> <b>plate,</b> PDL is located across the whole width of the newly formed cell plate. Based on the temporal and spatial organization of PDL in the phragmoplast, we termed this protein 'phragmoplastin'. The data suggest that phragmoplastin may be associated with exocytic vesicles that are depositing cell plate material during cytokinesis in the plant cell...|$|E
40|$|The large {{increase}} of continuous gps sites {{occurred in the}} recent years in the Central Mediterranean plate boundary zone offers the opportunity to study in detail the present-day kinematics in this actively de- <b>forming</b> <b>plate</b> boundary zone. The amount of available cgps data from scientific and commercial networks in the Italian region currently reaches more than 350 cgps stations, including more than 130 sites from the ring network ([URL] deployed by the Isti- tuto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia with high quality gps monuments and co-located with broad- band or very broad band seismometers. gps ambiguity resolution of such a large amount of data asks for a sin- gle and self-consistent processing method, {{in order to avoid the}} need of dividing the whole network in sever- al clusters as many of the scientific gps processing codes request and to maximize the processing time speed. The ambizap gps processing algorithm (Blewitt 2008), used to obtain daily ambiguity-fixed network so- lutions allows for a rapid and multiple reanalysis of large regional networks such the one presented in this work, that is composed by more than 580 gps stations. In this presentation we highlights some of the numer- ous scientific motivations behind this project, ranging from the definition of strain distribution and micro- plate kinematics within the plate boundary, to the geodynamic implications for the evolution of the Cala- brian Arc and Aeolian Islands...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of {{asymmetric}} creep-ageing behaviour on springback of aluminium alloys during creep age forming (CAF) process. An Al-Cu-Li alloy, AA 2050, which shows an apparent asymmetric tension and compression creep-ageing behaviour is used for investigation. Several CAF trial tests to form singly-curved AA 2050 plates with different thicknesses (3, 5 and 8 mm) are carried out with a four point bending setup. Meanwhile, two sets of finite element (FE) models of corresponding processes have been developed, in which either the conventional symmetric or the new asymmetric creep-ageing behaviour of the alloy was used. The asymmetric models can well predict the shape of formed plates for thicker materials (5 and 8 mm), while symmetric models provide over-prediction of final deflections. The results from asymmetric models indicate that more creep strain is generated in the tension stressed part of the <b>forming</b> <b>plate</b> than that in the other part with compressive stresses and therefore, resulting in an asymmetric distribution of the relaxed stresses through {{the thickness of the}} forming plates after creep-ageing. After springback, both top and bottom surfaces of the formed plates show significant compressive stresses while tensile residual stresses exist in the centre of the formed plates. The work in this study helps to understand the particular springback behaviour of AA 2050 with asymmetric creep-ageing behaviour in CAF, and can be used to guide future industrial applications of the alloy in the CAF process...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} ad-hoc experimental and integrated modelling techniques for springback compensation in creep-age forming (CAF). A test programme is presented which describes the material and workpiece information and the test plans for the experimental evaluation of the creep-ageing and springback behaviour of aluminium alloy 7 B 04 -T 651 under 115 oC. Experimental results from the creep-ageing and tensile tests {{were used to determine}} a CAF material model for the alloy. A flexible tool design has been proposed and a laboratory-scale prototype has been delivered and used to perform the CAF tests in this research. The determined CAF material model and geometry of the flexible tool design were treated as input and used to construct a CAF process model using finite element (FE) method. Comparisons between final deflections of FE-simulated and experimentally <b>formed</b> <b>plates</b> validated the springback predictive ability of the FE process model. The model was eventually employed to model springback-compensated tool shapes and using the modelled tool shapes to perform CAF tests have produced <b>formed</b> <b>plates</b> that have an average 0. 81 ?? 0. 14 mm of maximum absolute vertical difference from target shape. CAF can now be used to produce accurately shaped panel components in a laboratory environment using the equipment and techniques developed in this research. Open Acces...|$|R
