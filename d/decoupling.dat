5|$|Diffusion {{may also}} have had a {{significant}} effect on the evolution of primordial cosmic magnetic fields, fields which may have been amplified over time to become galactic magnetic fields. However, these cosmic magnetic fields may have been damped by radiative diffusion: just as acoustic oscillations in the plasma were damped by the diffusion of photons, so were magnetosonic waves (waves of ions travelling through a magnetised plasma). This process began before the era of neutrino <b>decoupling</b> and ended at the time of recombination.|$|E

In the first numerical scheme, we explore a fractional step method (operator splitting) to <b>decouple</b> the phase-field (Cahn-Hilliard equation) from the velocity field (Stokes-Darcy fluid equations). To further <b>decouple</b> the Stokes-Darcy system, we introduce a first order pressure stabilization {{term in the}} Darcy solver in the second numerical scheme so that the Stokes system is <b>decoupled</b> from the Darcy system and hence the CHSD system can be solved in a fully <b>decoupled</b> manner.

5|$|The {{mechanism}} for unfolding of globular proteins is necessarily general, but somewhat {{dependent on the}} amino acid sequence. Long sequences of alternating glycine and alanine {{have been shown to}} inhibit substrate unfolding, decreasing the efficiency of proteasomal degradation; this results in the release of partially degraded byproducts, possibly due to the <b>decoupling</b> of the ATP hydrolysis and unfolding steps. Such glycine-alanine repeats are also found in nature, for example in silk fibroin; in particular, certain Epstein–Barr virus gene products bearing this sequence can stall the proteasome, helping the virus propagate by preventing antigen presentation on the major histocompatibility complex.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A {{recent study}} showed that high failure rates in many {{instances}} of <b>decoupled</b> multi-robot motion planning makes the <b>decoupled</b> planning approach an unsuitable choice {{in comparison to the}} centralized approach. Motivated by this study we devised a new multi-robot motion planning strategy in which we partially merge the two phases of the basic <b>decoupled</b> planning approach. Our experimental results show that this new strategy significantly improves upon the reliability of the <b>decoupled</b> planning approach. Overall in our tests, the new strategy outperforms both the centralized and the <b>decoupled</b> planning approach, indicating that in practice our new strategy can be a better choice than both these approaches for solving multi-robot motion planning problems.

However, the literature has identified several mechanisms through which <b>decoupled</b> payments become coupled. We analyze the effects of uncertainty regarding future policy changes on farm-level production decisions and input use, focusing on farmers’ expectations of base acreage and yield updating.

5|$|In {{economic}} and environmental fields, the term <b>decoupling</b> is becoming increasingly used {{in the context of}} economic production and environmental quality. When used in this way, it refers to the ability of an economy to grow without incurring corresponding increases in environmental pressure. Ecological economics includes the study of societal metabolism, the throughput of resources that enter and exit the economic system in relation to environmental quality. An economy that is able to sustain GDP growth without having a negative impact on the environment is said to be decoupled. Exactly how, if, or to what extent this can be achieved is a subject of much debate. In 2011 the International Resource Panel, hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), warned that by 2050 the human race could be devouring 140 billion tons of minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass per year—three times its current rate of consumption—unless nations can make serious attempts at <b>decoupling.</b> The report noted that citizens of developed countries consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita per annum (ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries). By comparison, the average person in India today consumes four tons per year. Sustainability studies analyse ways to reduce resource intensity (the amount of resource (e.g. water, energy, or materials) needed for the production, consumption and disposal of a unit of good or service) whether this be achieved from improved economic management, product design, or new technology.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{effect of}} surface friction with winds aloft force surface winds to slow and back counterclockwise {{near the surface}} of the Earth blowing inward across isobars (lines of equal pressure), when compared to the winds in frictionless flow well above the Earth's surface. This layer where friction slows and changes the wind is known as the planetary boundary layer, sometimes the Ekman layer, and it is thickest during the day and thinnest at night. Daytime heating thickens the boundary layer as winds at the surface become increasingly mixed with winds aloft due to insolation, or solar heating. Radiative cooling overnight further enhances wind <b>decoupling</b> between the winds at the surface and the winds above the boundary layer by calming the surface wind which increases wind shear. These wind changes force wind shear between the boundary layer and the wind aloft, and is most emphasized at night.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a comparative analysis of impedance models for power electronic converters and {{systems for the}} purpose of stability investigations. Such models can be divided into either <b>decoupled</b> models or matrix models. A <b>decoupled</b> impedance model is highly appealing since the Single-Input-Single-Output (SISO) structure makes the analysis and result interpretation very simple. On the other hand, matrix impedance models are more accurate, and in some cases necessary. Previous works have applied various approximations to obtain <b>decoupled</b> models, and both the dq- and sequence domains have been used. This paper introduces the terms <b>decoupled</b> and semi-decoupled impedance models {{in order to have a}} clear classification of the available approximations. The accuracy of 4 <b>decoupled</b> impedance models are discussed based on the concept of Mirror Frequency Coupling (MFC). By definition the <b>decoupled</b> models based on sequence domain impedances will be exact for systems without MFC. In the general case, they are expected to be more accurate than the <b>decoupled</b> dq-impedance models. The paper defines a norm ϵ to measure the degree of coupling in the impedance matrices. This norm equals the error in the eigenvalue loci between the matrix and semi-decoupled models. This can also be viewed as the error in the semi-decoupled Nyquist plot. An example case study consisting of a grid-connected VSC with current controller and PLL is used to compare the different methods. It is found that <b>decoupled</b> and semi-decoupled models in the dq-domain are only applicable in grids with very low X/R-ratio. Furthermore, it is concluded that the <b>decoupled</b> model in the sequence domain gives close to equal results as the semi-decoupled model. Comment: 8 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
