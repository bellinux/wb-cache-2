5|$|Scotland's {{wildlife}} {{is typical}} of the north-west of Europe, although several of the larger mammals such as the lynx, brown bear, wolf, elk and walrus were hunted to extinction in historic times. There are important populations of seals and internationally significant nesting grounds for a variety of seabirds such as gannets. The golden eagle <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> national icon.|$|E

The Heart of a Woman has three primary settings—the San Francisco Bay Area, New York, and Egypt—and two secondary ones—London and Accra.|$|E
5|$|Macandal {{is a black}} slave, first {{introduced}} on the same plantation as Ti Noel. He is admired for his qualities that are irresistible to black women {{and his ability to}} captivate men. He regales tales of great kingdoms and speaks of epic battles in which the animals were allies of men, of the incarnation of the serpent, of a queen who was the Rainbow, and of horses adorned with silver coins. Macandal has his left arm amputated after a machinery accident on the plantation of Lenormand de Mezy and, unable to complete heavy work, is put in charge of pasturing the cattle. He departs for the mountains and discovers many secret herbs, plants, and fungi about which he is taught more by an old, mysterious woman who <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> witch. Macandal leaves the plantation, attains the ability to transform into various beings, and is represented as having superhuman powers due to his possession by the gods.|$|E

5|$|There are {{the remains}} of various broch towers in {{southern}} Scotland that appear to date from the period immediately prior to or following Agricola's invasion. They are about fifteen in number and are found in four locations: the Forth valley, close to the Firth of Tay, the far south-west and the eastern Borders. Their existence {{so far from the}} main centres of broch-building <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mystery. The destruction of the Leckie broch may have come {{at the hands of the}} Roman invaders, yet like the nearby site of Fairy Knowe at Buchlyvie a substantial amount of both Roman and native artefacts have been recovered there. Both structures were built in the late 1st century and were evidently high-status buildings. The inhabitants raised sheep, cattle and pigs, and benefited from a range of wild game including Red Deer and Wild Boar.|$|E

25|$|The term “flat bone” <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> misnomer because, {{although}} a flat bone is typically thin, {{it is also}} often curved. Examples include the cranial (skull) bones, the scapulae (shoulder blades), the sternum (breastbone), and the ribs. Flat bones serve as points of attachment for muscles and often protect internal organs. Flat bones {{do not have a}} medullary cavity because they are thin.|$|E
25|$|The {{collection}} of all morphisms from X to Y is denoted homC(X,Y) or simply hom(X, Y) {{and called the}} hom-set between X and Y. Some authors write MorC(X,Y), Mor(X, Y) or C(X, Y). Note that the term hom-set <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> misnomer as the {{collection of}} morphisms {{is not required to}} be a set. A category where hom(X, Y) is a set for all objects X and Y is called locally small.|$|E

He <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> celebrity among the townspeople for his reputed prophetic and healing abilities. His {{popularity}} inspires both admiration and jealousy amidst his fellow monks. Zosima provides a refutation to Ivan's atheistic arguments and helps to explain Alyosha's character. Zosima's teachings shape the way Alyosha deals with the young boys he meets in the Ilyusha storyline.|$|E

He set out to construct a fictional account of what might have caused the incident, without knowing any of the details of the crime.

25|$|Jade : is {{the most}} common material, and is {{associated}} with the most common, least powerful of the Exalted, the Terrestrial Exalted. There are six different colors of jade, five of which correspond to one of the Elemental Dragons. Blue jade resonates with Air, white with Earth, black with Water, green with Wood, and red with Fire. The sixth, yellow jade, <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mystery, in that it should not exist and only comes about through alchemical mistakes. Jade weapons are unnaturally fast, and jade armor doesn't tire the wearer.|$|E
25|$|Currently, the /w/ offglide is only {{believed}} to have existed in */aw/ and */uw/ resulting in the MSB o-class vowels /ɔ/ and /o/ respectively. The absence of */iw/ and */ow/ in reconstructions <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mystery, however it is possible that, by analogy with the /j/ offglide, */aw/ */iw/ */ow/ */uw/ all existed, resulting in pairs {{with or without the}} rounded on-glide: /ɔ/ /o/ /u̯ɔ/ /u̯o/ which later merged. This may explain why the Burmese orthography indicates the vowel /o/ with both the diacritics for both the /i/ and /u/ vowels and, previously, a following consonantal /w/.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the large}} size and extreme {{immobilization}} some casts, particularly {{those used in}} or before the 1970s, the popular term full body cast <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> misnomer. The popular and media-driven conception of a massive cast encasing all four limbs, the trunk, and the head – sometimes leaving only small slits for the eyes, nose, and mouth – is a true rarity in recorded medical history, and this type of large scale cast appears more commonly in various Hollywood movies and on television shows. The term body cast (or full body cast) is sometimes casually used by laymen to describe any {{of a number of}} body and/or spica casts, from a simple body jacket to a more extensive hip spica.|$|E

25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{structure of}} the play {{is very much in}} keeping with that of Japanese traditional drama forms as a whole. The philosophy of jo-ha-kyū is employed throughout, as actions, scenes, acts, and the play as a whole begin slow (jo), then get faster (ha), and end quickly (kyū). Also, Sugawara follows the traditional five-act structure and the themes traditionally associated with particular acts. Act One begins calmly and auspiciously, including scenes at the Imperial Palace. Act Two features combat and murder. Act Three <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sewamono insertion into the jidaimono tale, turning away from the affairs of warriors and politics to focus on the lives of commoners. Act Four, often in other plays a michiyuki journey, metaphorically associated with a journey through hell, features a dramatic storm and an emotional journey for Kan Shōjō, who becomes enraged at the traitorous activities of Shihei, and kills himself, becoming a thunder god. Act Five wraps up the plot quickly and returns to themes of auspiciousness.|$|E
25|$|In Jeff Rovin's 1995 non-canon novelization, {{set before}} the first game, Scorpion plays a minor role and his backstory {{deviates}} from the games, as he <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> combination of {{a father and son}} instead of an individual ninja specter. The father, a former Lin Kuei member turned tolltaker named Yong Park, was killed by Sub-Zero in front of Park's family and his body dumped into a canal. Yong's spirit merges with his young son Tsui's body in order for the latter to seek revenge under the form of Scorpion, during which his costume and armor magically appear on his body. When Scorpion challenges Sub-Zero to battle in hopes of avenging his father's murder, they do nothing more than exchange words before Sub-Zero sets off a smoke bomb and escapes. Scorpion never uses his spear aside from a scene in which he shoots it at a tree as a test shortly after his transformation.|$|E
25|$|Associations with {{species of}} pitcher plants {{are so many}} and varied {{that the study of}} Nepenthes infauna <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{discipline}} in its own right. Camponotus schmitzi, the diving ant, has an intimate degree of mutualism with the pitcher plant Nepenthes bicalcarata; it not only retrieves prey and detritus from {{beneath the surface of the}} liquid in the pitchers, but repels herbivores, and cleans the pitcher peristome, maintaining its slippery nature. The ants have been reported to attack struggling prey, hindering their escape, so there might be an element of myrmecotrophy to the relationship. Numerous species of mosquitoes lay their eggs in the liquid, where their larvae play various roles, depending on species; some eat microbes and detritus, as is common among mosquito larvae, whereas some species of Toxorhynchites also breed in pitchers, and their larvae are predators of other species of mosquito larvae. Apart from the crab spiders on pitchers, an actual small, red crab Geosesarma malayanum will enter the fluid, robbing and scavenging, though reputedly it does so at some risk of being captured and digested itself.|$|E
