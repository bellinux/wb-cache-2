5|$|Coenzymes {{are small}} organic {{molecules}} {{that can be}} loosely or tightly bound to an enzyme. Coenzymes transport chemical groups from one enzyme to another. Examples include NADH, NADPH and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Some coenzymes, such as flavin mononucleotide (FMN), <b>flavin</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide</b> (FAD), thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), and tetrahydrofolate (THF), are derived from vitamins. These coenzymes cannot be synthesized by the body de novo and closely related compounds (vitamins) must be acquired from the diet. The chemical groups carried include the hydride ion (H−) carried by NAD or NADP+, the phosphate group carried by adenosine triphosphate, the acetyl group carried by coenzyme A, formyl, methenyl or methyl groups carried by folic acid and the methyl group carried by S-adenosylmethionine.|$|E
5|$|Succinate-Q oxidoreductase, {{also known}} as complex II or succinate dehydrogenase, is a second entry point to the {{electron}} transport chain. It is unusual {{because it is the}} only enzyme that is part of both the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Complex II consists of four protein subunits and contains a bound <b>flavin</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide</b> (FAD) cofactor, iron–sulfur clusters, and a heme group that does not participate in electron transfer to coenzyme Q, but is believed to be important in decreasing production of reactive oxygen species. It oxidizes succinate to fumarate and reduces ubiquinone. As this reaction releases less energy than the oxidation of NADH, complex II does not transport protons across the membrane and does not contribute to the proton gradient.|$|E
25|$|Some enzymes or enzyme {{complexes}} require several cofactors. For example, the multienzyme complex pyruvate dehydrogenase at {{the junction}} of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle requires five organic cofactors and one metal ion: loosely bound thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), covalently bound lipoamide and <b>flavin</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide</b> (FAD), and the cosubstrates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and coenzyme A (CoA), and a metal ion (Mg2+).|$|E

Meyer, J. Biol. Chem. 257 : 1333 - 1341, 1982). All three enzymes exhibited a cofactor composition of two <b>flavin</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotides,</b> two molybdenums, eight irons and eight labile sulfides per dimeric molecule, typical for molybdenum-containing iron-sulfur flavoproteins. The millimolar extinction coefficient of the COXs at 450 nm was 72 (per two <b>flavin</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotides),</b> a value similar to that of milk xanthine oxidase and chicken liver xanthine dehydrogenase at 450 nm.

Recently, selective MAO-B inhibitors have received increasing attention due to their neuroprotective properties and the multiple roles they can play in the therapy of neurodegenerative disorders. This study was based on 10 scaffolds that were selected from more than a million lead compounds in the ZINCv 12 lead library for their structural and physicochemical properties which inhibit MAO-B. Utilizing ZINC and Accelrys 3. 1 fragment-based libraries, which contain about 400 thousand fragments, we generated 200 potential candidates. GOLD, LibDock, and AutoDock 4. 02 were used to identify the inhibition constants and their position in the active sites of both MAO isozymes. The dispositions of the candidate molecules within the organism were checked with ADMET PSA 2 D (polar surface area) against ADMET AlogP 98 (the logarithm of the partition coefficient between n-octanol and water).

25|$|In biochemistry, <b>flavin</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide</b> (FAD) is a redox cofactor, more {{specifically}} a prosthetic group of a protein, involved in several important enzymatic reactions in metabolism. A flavoprotein is a protein {{that contains a}} flavin moiety, this {{may be in the}} form of FAD or flavin mononucleotide (FMN). There are many flavoproteins besides components of the succinate dehydrogenase complex, including α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and a component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, some examples are shown in section 6.|$|E
25|$|Organic cofactors {{are small}} organic {{molecules}} (typically a molecular mass less than 1000 Da) {{that can be}} either loosely or tightly bound to the enzyme and directly participate in the reaction. In the latter case, when {{it is difficult to}} remove without denaturing the enzyme, it can be called a prosthetic group. It is important to emphasize that there is no sharp division between loosely and tightly bound cofactors. Indeed, many such as NAD+ can be tightly bound in some enzymes, while it is loosely bound in others. Another example is thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), which is tightly bound in transketolase or pyruvate decarboxylase, while it is less tightly bound in pyruvate dehydrogenase. Other coenzymes, <b>flavin</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide</b> (FAD), biotin, and lipoamide, for instance, are covalently bound. Tightly bound cofactors are, in general, regenerated during the same reaction cycle, while loosely bound cofactors can be regenerated in a subsequent reaction catalyzed by a different enzyme. In the latter case, the cofactor can also be considered a substrate or cosubstrate.|$|E

Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine (6 - 4) pyrimidone photoproducts [(6 - 4) photoproducts] are the two major photoproducts produced in DNA by UV irradiation. Two types of photolyases have been identified, one specific for CPDs (CPD photolyase) and another specific for (6 - 4) photoproducts [(6 - 4) photolyase]. (6 - 4) Photolyase activity was first found in Drosophila melanogaster and to date this gene has been cloned only from this organism. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cloned gene shows that (6 - 4) photolyase {{is a member of the}} CPD photolyase/blue light photoreceptor family. Both CPD photolyase and blue light photoreceptor are flavoproteins and bound <b>flavin</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotides</b> (FADs) are essential for their catalytic activity.

40|$|In {{anaerobic}} bacteria using aromatic growth substrates, glutaryl-coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenases (GDHs) {{are involved}} in the catabolism of the central intermediate benzoyl-CoA to three acetyl-CoAs and CO 2. In this work, we studied GDHs from the strictly anaerobic, aromatic compound-degrading organisms Geobacter metallireducens (GDHGeo) (Fe[III] reducing) and Desulfococcus multivorans (GDHDes) (sulfate reducing). GDHGeo was purified from cells grown on benzoate and after the heterologous expression of the benzoate-induced bamM gene. The gene coding for GDHDes was identified after screening of a cosmid gene library. Reverse transcription-PCR revealed that its expression was induced by benzoate; the product was heterologously expressed and isolated. Both wild-type and recombinant GDHGeo catalyzed the oxidative decarboxylation of glutaryl-CoA to crotonyl-CoA at similar rates. In contrast, recombinant GDHDes catalyzed only the dehydrogenation to glutaconyl-CoA. The latter compound was decarboxylated subsequently to crotonyl-CoA by the addition of membrane extracts from cells grown on benzoate in the presence of 20 mM NaCl. All GDH enzymes were purified as homotetramers of a 43 - to 44 -kDa subunit and contained 0. 6 to 0. 7 <b>flavin</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotides</b> (FADs) /monomer. The kinetic properties for glutaryl-CoA conversion were as follows: for GDHGeo, the Km was 30 ± 2 μM and the Vmax was 3. 2 ± 0. 2 μmol min− 1 mg− 1, and for GDHDes, the Km was 52 ± 5 μM and the Vmax was 11 ± 1 μmol min− 1 mg− 1. GDHDes but not GDHGeo was inhibited by glutaconyl-CoA. Highly conserved amino acid residues that were proposed to be specifically involved in the decarboxylation of the intermediate glutaconyl-CoA were identified in GDHGeo but are missing in GDHDes. The differential use of energy-yielding/energy-demanding enzymatic processes in anaerobic bacteria that degrade aromatic compounds is discussed in view of phylogenetic relationships and constraints of overall energy metabolism...|$|R

Thus enzymes, respiratory pigments, antibodies, many antigens, and several hormones are protein in nature.

30|$|Mitochondria are the “powerhouse” of the cell. They {{generate}} {{energy in}} the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation. The electron transport (or respiratory) chain consists of enzyme complexes and carrier molecules associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane. Oxidation of nutrients is coupled with reduction of nicotinamide (NADH) and <b>flavin</b> (FADH 2) <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotides</b> that transfer electrons to complexes I and II, respectively. Electrons then flow through complexes III and IV, transported via ubiquinone and cytochrome c, and finally reduce oxygen to water. Electron transfer through complexes I, III, and IV generates a proton-motive force across the inner mitochondrial membrane that is used by complex V (the ATP synthase) to generate ATP [8]. The complete oxidation of one molecule of glucose produces 10 molecules of NADH and 2 molecules of FADH 2. Therefore, most of electrons normally enter the respiratory chain through complex I, missing out complex II.|$|R

Germline mutations in phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) have been recently reported in 23 % {{of a large}} series of classic CS. Here, we validated our small (n = 10) pilot study in a large patient series that germline variations in succinate dehydrogenase genes (SDHx) occur in 8 % (49 / 608) of PTEN mutation-negative CS and CS-like (CSL) individuals (SDHvar+). None of these SDHx variants was found in 700 population controls (P < 0. 0001). We then found that SDHx variants also occur in 6 % (26 / 444) of PTEN mutation-positive (PTENmut+) CS/CSL individuals (PTENmut+/SDHvar+). Of 22 PTENmut+/SDHvar+ females, 17 had breast cancers compared with 34 / 105 PTENmut+ (P < 0. 001) or 27 / 47 SDHvar+ patients (P = 0. 06). Notably, individuals with SDHvar+ alone had the highest thyroid cancer prevalence (24 / 47) compared with PTENmut+ patients (27 / 105, P = 0. 002) or PTENmut+/SDHvar+ carriers (6 / 22, P = 0. 038). Patient-derived SDHvar+ lymphoblastoid cells had elevated cellular reactive oxygen species, highest in PTENmut+/SDHvar+ cells, correlating with apoptosis resistance. SDHvar+ cells showed stabilized and hyperactivated hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) 1 α signaling.

Separation of the two enzymes, one which is specific for nicotinamide <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide</b> phosphate and the other which is active with nicotinamide <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide</b> or nicotinamide <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide</b> phosphate was facilitated by the marked difference in their respective isoelectric points, which were at pH 5. 0 and 6. 9.
