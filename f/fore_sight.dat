60|$|Thursday morning {{dawned on}} similar scenes. The {{garrison}} employed such intervals as occurred in strengthening their defences and improving their cover, {{particularly in the}} approaches to the Maxim and field gun platforms. At 3 P.M. the enemy came out of Chakdara village, and, carrying ladders to scale the walls, and bundles of grass to throw on the barbed wire, made a formidable effort. They directed the attack mainly against the signal station. This building is a strong, square, stone tower. Its entrance is above six feet from the ground. All around the top runs a machiconlis gallery, a kind of narrow balcony, with holes in the floor to fire through. It is well provided with loopholes. At 4 o'clock it was closely assailed. The garrison of the fort aided the tower guard by their fire. So bold were the enemy in their efforts, that they rushed in under the musketry of the defence, and lighted a great heap of grass about three yards from the doorway. The flames sprang up. A howl of ferocious delight arose. But the tribesmen relapsed into silence, when they saw that no real harm was done. At sunset the <b>fore</b> <b>sight</b> of the fort Maxim was shot away, and the defenders were temporarily deprived of the service of that powerful weapon. They soon managed, however, to rig up a makeshift, which answered all practical purposes. At 8 P.M. the enemy wearied of the struggle, and the firing died away to desultory skirmishing. They toiled all night carrying away their dead, but next morning over fifty bodies were still lying around the signal tower. Their losses had been enormous.|$|E
50|$|The Breda's {{rear and}} <b>fore</b> <b>sight</b> were {{both on the}} gun body, so only one barrel could be zeroed. The {{magazine}} was loaded using 20-round stripper clips, which {{were known to be}} fragile, especially in combat conditions. In North Africa the weapon was nearly unusable: desert sand and dust caused the weapon to jam continuously. The oil from the lubrication necessary to fire the Breda exacerbated its flaws. In the Balkans, Russian Campaign and other theatres of war the weapon achieved slightly better results.|$|E
60|$|He soon returned, {{and when}} all the <b>fore</b> and back <b>sights</b> had been rubbed by the {{phosphorus}} the firing recommenced, and the Doctor sent Wilson down with the phosphorus to {{the men on the}} platforms facing the threatened point.|$|R
50|$|Solving for {{the effect}} of wind is a common problem in air {{navigation}} and was semi-automated in the Course Setting Bomb Sight of late World War I vintage. To use such a vector bombsight, the bomb aimer first requires an accurate measurement of the speed {{and direction of the}} wind. This was taken through a variety of methods, often using the bombsight itself as a reference. When these figures were dialed into the system, the calculator moved the <b>sights</b> <b>fore</b> or aft to account for the wind, as well as side-to-side to indicate the proper approach angle.|$|R
50|$|A special form {{of rubber}} band gun {{can be made}} however, using ONLY {{popsicle}} sticks, staples, and rubber bands of various styles and sizes. This specialized style developed and honed by a high-school student, Stuart Burton, is very malleable, and can be utilized to develop very advanced and complicated rubber band guns. For instance, using levers and sliding mechanisms, one can make a pump action shotgun. Using simple geometry and specialized positioning, you can easily make semi-automatic and 2-shot burst fire weapons, {{as well as more}} complicated fully automatic weapons using paperclips as an axis for a rotating firing piece. Occasionally other materials like bamboo skewers and/or other materials may be used in the making of the gun. <b>Sights,</b> <b>fore</b> grips and magazines to hold extra rubberbands may also be made, according to liking of the owner however. Through creativity and imagination, one can make detachable sights, grips, stocks, silencers, and under-barrel shotguns.|$|R
