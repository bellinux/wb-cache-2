5|$|As a batsman, Macaulay was {{reasonably}} good and possibly {{better than his}} statistics would suggest. He was capable of batting well in a crisis but may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>prevented</b> from honing his batting skills by the Yorkshire leadership who wished him to focus on bowling. He generally batted low down in the order after the all-rounders in the team. Macaulay's fielding was also very effective. He was excellent at close range to the batsmen, particularly from his own bowling.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{government}} officials {{denied that the}} dam was poorly built; many politicians and an engineer for the nation's water company blamed the dam's poor construction {{as the source of}} the extreme death toll. Prior to the arrival of the storm, many residents had repeatedly requested that a stone wall be built to protect their homes. After the storm, they said that the deaths could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>prevented.</b> According to one account, two master planned communities were situated {{in the middle of the}} drainage and were thus deluged by the storm. The water department head took the blame for the construction, but also said that the disaster was a natural phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, he {{was picked}} by New York Governor Mario Cuomo to chair a {{scientific}} fact-finding commission on the Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant, a job that required him {{to find common ground}} between the many viewpoints represented on the commission. The commission eventually recommended the closure of the plant, a course he personally disagreed with. Cuomo had formed the commission in mid-May 1983 to provide him with recommendations regarding the plant's safety, the adequacy of emergency plans, and the economics of operating the plant. The commission's consensus recommendations included unanimous findings that no emergency evacuation of the plant could be conducted without the cooperation of Suffolk County, which was refusing to approve an evacuation plan; that the construction of the plant would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>prevented</b> if it had been started after new Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations were put into effect after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979; and that operating the plant would not reduce utility costs. Marburger himself at the time emphasized that the governor had not been seeking a consensus but rather encouraged multiple viewpoints to be reflected, and characterized the consensus conclusions as not the only important section of the report.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1998 Act, whistleblowers in the United Kingdom had no {{protection}} against being dismissed by their employer. Although they could avoid being sued for {{breach of confidence}} thanks to a public interest defence, this did not prevent subtle or open victimisation in the workplace, including disciplinary action, dismissal, failure to gain promotion or a pay rise. During the early to mid-1990s, interest in whistleblower protection grew, partially because {{of a series of}} financial scandals and health and safety accidents, which investigations into showed could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>prevented</b> if employees had been permitted to voice their concerns, and partially because of the work of the Committee on Standards in Public Life. In 1995 and 1996, two private member's bills dealing with whistleblowers were introduced to Parliament, by Tony Wright and Don Touhig respectively, but both efforts fell through. When Richard Shepherd proposed a similar bill, however, he got government support for it on the condition that it be an amendment to the Employment Rights Act 1996 rather than a new area of law in its own right. Public Concern at Work, a UK-based whistleblowers charity, was involved in the drafting and consultation stages of the bill. The case of Graham Pink added to the pressure to introduce whistleblower protection legislation.|$|E

25|$|According to Shayler the 1994 {{bombing of}} the Israeli embassy in London was known to the {{intelligence}} services before it happened, and could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>prevented.</b> The British government later placed an injunction on the republication of Shayler's claims although this was later lifted on 2 November 1997 allowing the paper to print his claims of how the {{bombing of the}} Israeli Embassy in London in 1994 could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>prevented</b> if the service had acted on prior knowledge it had obtained. On 19 June 1998 he told The Spectator magazine that the security service had information that could have prevented the 1993 Bishopsgate bombing.|$|E

25|$|It {{has also}} been argued that the one-child policy is not {{effective}} enough to justify its costs, and that external factors caused a dramatic decrease in Chinese fertility rates to begin even before 1979.

Nevertheless, the Chinese government and others estimate that at least 250million births <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>prevented</b> by the policy.|$|E
25|$|Another key {{recommendation}} of the report was to encourage clinicians to promote the flu vaccine to all pregnant women, with flu {{one of the leading}} causes of preventable death in pregnancy (1 in 11 of the women who died).

25|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{estimate}} that vaccination averts 2-3 million deaths per year (in all age groups), {{and up to}} 1.5 million children die each year due to diseases which could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>prevented</b> by vaccination.

25|$|The {{question}} of whether Tommy Simpson's death in the Tour de France might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>prevented</b> has one clear answer. Yes, and it should have been. Three days after this year's race, the French authorities announced that next October and November a French and Italian rider would be prosecuted for alleged doping offences in last year's Tour. France had surrendered the need rigrously to prevent doping to the discreet requirement of not tackling it on a big tourist occasion until a year had safely passed. It takes two days at most to analyse samples: it took a year for France to authorise prosecutions.|$|E
