50|$|A fire shelter is {{a safety}} device {{of last resort}} used by {{wildland}} firefighters when trapped by wildfires. While such a shelter cannot withstand sustained contact with flames, it can protect a firefighter's life in a short-lived grass fire. Furthermore, {{it is designed to}} reflect radiant <b>heat,</b> <b>protect</b> against convective heat, and trap breathable air (most firefighters' deaths are from inhaling hot gases) so that firefighters can survive in non-burning areas surrounded by intense fire for more than an hour.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the four Pioneer Venus probe spacecraft which will explore {{the atmosphere of}} Venus in mid-December, 1978. The probes, one large and three small, will carry a complement of sixteen scientific instruments which will make measurements from entry (200 km-altitude) down to the planet surface. The surface environment, approximately 770 K temperature and 95 bar. pressure, leads to a design in which the equipment complement is housed in internally insulated, spherical pressure vessels. Entry deceleration and stabilization are provided by 45 deg. half-angle conical forebodies, <b>heat</b> <b>protected</b> by carbon phenolic ablative heat shields. For the large probe, a parachute provides additional retardation between 67 and 44 km altitude, a region of extreme scientific interest...|$|R

For example, the skunk cabbage generates heat, which allows it to melt its way through a layer of snow in early spring. The heat, however, is mostly used to help spread its pungent odor and attract pollinators.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{mitigate}} the thermal shock impact, many ceramics, refractories or <b>heat</b> <b>protecting</b> layers are made of functionally graded (FGM) or layered structures. Fracture mechanical methods are needed to evaluate the resistance of such structures against failure under thermal shock. Despite a lot of theoretical {{work has been done}} for two-dimensional crack configurations in thermo-elastic FGM, real defects and structural components are of three-dimensional (3 D) nature. In most cases the real gradation of the thermoelastic material properties does not obey simple mathematical functions, but show a complex dependency on location due to manufacturing. Moreover, the elastic and thermodynamic properties depend on temperature itself. In the paper, we present the derivation of the 3 D J-integral for arbitrary location and temperature dependent material behavior. The J-integral is implemented in FEM by means of the equivalent domain integral technique. The method is applied to a thermally loaded plate of FGM with a surface crack. The influence of the material gradation on the results is investigated in various examples...|$|R
50|$|Although Anne {{had written}} {{reminding}} Lorenzo of {{his promise to}} send it to her, she was to be disappointed. Lorenzo had built special stables for it, either at the family's villa at Poggio a Caiano or in the Via della Scala in Florence itself, with <b>heating</b> to <b>protect</b> it from the damp Florentine winters. Shortly after its arrival the giraffe broke its neck and died after its head became stuck in the beams of these stables.|$|R
50|$|Most {{systems may}} also be {{equipped}} with smoke, heat, and/or carbon monoxide detectors. These are also known as 24-hour zones (which are on at all times). Smoke and <b>heat</b> detectors <b>protect</b> from the risk of fire using different detection methods. Carbon monoxide detectors help protect from the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning. Although an intruder alarm panel may also have these detectors connected, it may not meet all the local fire code requirements of a fire alarm system.|$|R
50|$|Wildfire {{suppression}} is a {{range of}} firefighting tactics used to suppress wildfires. Firefighting efforts in wild land areas require different techniques, equipment, and training from the more familiar structure fire fighting found in populated areas. Working in conjunction with specially designed aerial firefighting aircraft, these wildfire-trained crews suppress flames, construct firelines, and extinguish flames and areas of <b>heat</b> to <b>protect</b> resources and natural wilderness. Wildfire suppression also addresses {{the issues of the}} wildland-urban interface, where populated areas border with wild land areas.|$|R
50|$|If {{they go out}} in the snow, ice clumps {{will stick}} between their paw pads; just rinse off in warm water or buy booties. When owners give them a bath, they must make sure to dry them. Some in shorter clips can blot and air dry, but most will need to be blown dry. Owners can also comb their hair out after bathing so as not to dry in mats. Use high air but low <b>heat</b> to <b>protect</b> their {{sensitive}} skin. Hot air can damage the skin.|$|R
5000|$|Rabbits {{can live}} {{outdoors}} in properly constructed, sheltered hutches, which provide {{protection from the}} elements in winter and keep rabbits cool in summer <b>heat.</b> To <b>protect</b> from predators, rabbit hutches are usually situated in a fenced yard, shed, barn, or other enclosed structure, which may also contain a larger pen for exercise. [...] Rabbits {{in such an environment}} can alternatively be allowed to roam the secured area freely, and simply be provided with an adapted doghouse for shelter. A more elaborate setup is an artificial warren.|$|R

50|$|Instead {{of being}} shed {{annually}} {{as in many}} of the other species of Eucalyptus, the dead bark accumulates on the trees, forming the fissures. It becomes rough after drying out and becomes impregnated with kino, a dark red tree sap exuded by the tree. The bark is resistant to fire and <b>heat</b> and <b>protects</b> the living tissue within the trunk and branches from fire. In cases of extreme fire, where leaves and shoots are removed, the protective bark aids in protecting epicormic buds which allow the tree to reshoot.|$|R
5000|$|During {{emergency}} response operations, {{law enforcement and}} corrections officers are vulnerable to heat strokes or hyperthermia. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the United States publishes a heat stress [...] "Quick Card", that contains a checklist designed to help prevent <b>heat</b> stress.To <b>protect</b> users from <b>heat</b> stress, blunt trauma PPE can allow air flows underneath the suit to maximize the body's natural cooling process of perspiration. With good air ventilation, the suit will help cool the user and reduce excess body heat which can contribute to heat stress.|$|R

50|$|HOCl {{is known}} to cause post-translational {{modifications}} to proteins, the notable ones being cysteine and methionine oxidation. A recent examination of HOCl's bactericidal role revealed {{it to be a}} potent inducer of protein aggregation. Hsp33, a chaperone known to be activated by oxidative <b>heat</b> stress, <b>protects</b> bacteria from the effects of HOCl by acting as a holdase, effectively preventing protein aggregation. Strains of E. coli and Vibrio cholerae lacking Hsp33 were rendered especially sensitive to HOCl. Hsp33 protected many essential proteins from aggregation and inactivation due to HOCl, which is a probable mediator of HOCl's bactericidal effects.|$|R
50|$|Vernix is theorized {{to serve}} several purposes, {{including}} moisturizing the infant's skin, and facilitating {{passage through the}} birth canal. It serves to conserve <b>heat</b> and <b>protect</b> the delicate newborn skin from environmental stress. Vernix is also thought to have an antibacterial effect; though {{there is little evidence}} to support a chemical role of vernix in protecting the infant from infection, it may form a physical barrier to the passage of bacteria. It {{is one of the many}} similarities between our species and semi-aquatic mammals and it can therefore not be excluded that it serves similar functions as in newborn seals.|$|R

5000|$|Heat shock proteins, as a class, {{are among}} the most highly {{expressed}} cellular proteins across all species. [...] As their name implies, <b>heat</b> shock proteins <b>protect</b> cells when stressed by elevated temperatures. They account for 1-2% of total protein in unstressed cells.

50|$|A {{number of}} walled gardens in Britain have one hollow wall with {{openings}} in the stonework on the side facing towards the garden, so that fires could be lit inside the wall to provide additional <b>heat</b> to <b>protect</b> the fruit growing against the wall. Heat would escape into the garden through these openings, and {{the smoke from the}} fires would be directed upwards through chimneys or flues. This kind of hollow wall is found at Croxteth Hall in Liverpool (England), and Eglinton Country Park and Dunmore House, both in Scotland. In the 1800s, such walls were lined with pipes and connected to a boiler, as at Bank Hall in Bretherton.|$|R
