5000|$|In {{the early}} days of the county, before the {{construction}} of railways or extensive roadways inland, the Mississippi River was the primary transportation route, and the first three county seats were each located on the river. In 1836, Port Royal was designated as the first county seat. [...] In 1841, high waters on the Mississippi River <b>flooded</b> <b>Port</b> Royal, and in 1842 the county seat was moved to the town of Delta. [...] High waters on the Mississippi also flooded Delta, and in 1850 the county seat was moved to Friars Point, which had a population of about 1,000 in 1920, and received its name in honor of Robert Friar, an early settler. As nearby Clarksdale grew in population and influence, it challenged Friars Point's hold on the county government, and in 1892, Coahoma County was divided into two jurisdictions, one going to Friars Point and the other to Clarksdale. In 1930, the county seat was given exclusively to Clarksdale, which had a population of 7,500 in 1920. Clarksdale is now the largest and most important city in the county, and was named for John Clark, a brother-in-law of Governor James L. Alcorn, whose home, Eagle’s Nest, was in this county.|$|E
50|$|To get a {{submarine}} to surface, the main vents {{in the top}} of the tank are closed and high-pressure compressed air is blown into the ballast tanks, forcing the water out through the <b>flood</b> <b>ports</b> at the bottom of the tank. This increases the vessel's displacement. When the weight of the displaced water becomes greater than the weight of the vessel, buoyancy becomes positive, and the submarine begins to rise.|$|R
50|$|In general, main {{ballast tanks}} have the Kingston valve atop the tank. This Kingston valve, {{controllable}} both manually and hydraulically, is known {{by some as}} main vent operating gear. Main ballast tanks are in pairs, {{one on each side}} of the boat. One Kingston valve serves a pair, but each tank has a vent riser, with air connections and stop valves in the vent riser. The tank bottom is open to the sea through <b>flood</b> <b>ports.</b> The trapped air in the tank provides positive buoyancy while on the surface, although sea water sloshing in through the <b>flood</b> <b>ports</b> must be removed occasionally from the ballast tank(s) when cruising on the surface by means of low pressure air. The tank is capped by a vent riser, a pipe coming out of the top of the tank that terminates at a Kingston valve. In the vent riser is a valve that when shut, prevents flooding the tank when the submarine is rigged for surface. When the sub is rigged for dive, this valve is opened and flooding the tank becomes an option. Normally, the tank is flooded when the Kingston valve is opened, usually hydraulically from the control room. This Kingston valve then is left open until time to surface comes. This is because a slight leak of air from the air line provided to blow the tank into the vent riser could slowly make the boat more buoyant. When surfacing, the Kingston valve gets shut so the introduced air gets trapped in the tank and pushes the water out the tank's bottom through the <b>flood</b> <b>port.</b> The Kingston valve associated with each ballast tank can be operated manually. The vent riser valves get opened or shut manually during the rig for surface or rig for dive procedure.|$|R

50|$|Four years later, {{the church}} celebrated its fiftieth anniversary. At that time, it was {{reported}} that the congregation had baptized 1,829 people and confirmed another 413. Rev. C. L. Fulforth served the congregation for thirty-nine years, from 1890 until its closure in 1929. In 1929, Church of the Messiah merged with St. Matthew’s Mission, Oxford Circle, which was organized by the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania in September 1928. According to Church News, conditions which resulted in a dwindling congregation led to the decision to dispose of the Church of the Messiah property in Port Richmond. The neighborhood’s ethnic makeup was in flux when the church was closed as Eastern European immigrants <b>flooded</b> <b>Port</b> Richmond. In fact, Church of the Messiah helped to incubate a Polish Episcopal congregation in 1917 by allowing the fledgling congregation to use its building. In 1932, the newly merged congregation, which was named Church of the Messiah, Oxford Circle, name, dedicated a new building at 6000 Large Street in the Lower Northeast. Fifteen memorial windows, chancel furniture (including the altar, pulpit, lectern, and font), and the organ from Church of the Messiah, Richmond were incorporated into this building. In March 1930, the rector, wardens, and vestrymen of Church of the Messiah transferred the property to The Church Foundation to facilitate the sale of the site. In June, the Foundation sold the site to the Austrian Seacoast Beneficial and Benevolent Society or Adriatic Club (Austrianskih Primorvec Društvo Zamjenite Pomoći I Dobročinstvo U Filadelfi) for $15,500.22. While the building was under consideration for historic destination, the building was hastily demolished in 2016.|$|E
5000|$|Haiti, already rain-saturated by Fay and Gustav, was {{hit hard}} by {{flooding}} and mudslides from several days of heavy rainfall, particularly {{in the city of}} Gonaïves which also suffered catastrophic damage in 2004 from Hurricane Jeanne. Nearly the entire city was flooded with water as high as 2 meters (6.6 feet) deep, and some people had to be rescued on their roofs. In Les Cayes, a hospital had to be evacuated as it was swamped by flood water. At least 5,000 people there were moved to public shelters due to the flooding. The United Nations have ordered relief convoys to the hard-hit region, including rafts to help rescue victims. As of late on September 4, Haiti's government said the death toll from Tropical Storm Hanna had increased to at least 529, with most of the deaths coming in the <b>flooded</b> <b>port</b> city of Gonaïves, where the destruction was described as [...] "catastrophic" [...] and 495 bodies were discovered as of late on September 5. Haitian authorities said the tally could grow once officials are able to make their way through Gonaïves. [...] "The assessment is only partial, because it is impossible to enter the city for the moment", Gonaïves Mayor Stephen Moise said.In the aftermath of Hanna at least 48,000 from the Gonaïves areas went to shelters. Some people slept on the roofs of their house to protect them from looters. The catastrophe left many homelessand begging for food and clothes. Others left for the mountains hoping to wait out the next storms on the horizon.Haitians became aggravated at the lack of assistance in the wake of Hanna, with very little aid coming from international organizations.Bridges north and south of Gonaïves collapsed, with roads {{in the vicinity of the}} area transformed into swamps.|$|E
50|$|When on {{the surface}} a submarine's ballast tanks are filled with air which gives the vessel its {{buoyancy}} and {{in order for the}} submarine to submerge water is taken into the ballast tanks through the <b>flood</b> <b>ports</b> {{at the bottom of the}} tanks, effacing this excess buoyancy.

40|$|Most network {{intrusion}} tools (e. g., Bro) use per-flow {{state to}} reassemble TCP connections and fragments {{in order to}} detect network attacks (e. g., SYN Flooding or Connection Hijacking) and preliminary reconnaissance (e. g., Port Scans). On the other hand, if network intrusion detection is to be implemented at high speeds at network vantage points, some form of aggregation is necessary. While many security analysts believe that such per-flow state is required {{for many of these}} problems, there is no clear proof that this is the case. In fact, a number of problems (such as detecting large traffic footprints or counting identifiers) have scalable solutions. In this paper, we initiate the study of identifying when and how a security attack detection problem can have a scalable solution. We use tools from Communication Complexity to prove that the common formulations of many well-known intrusion detection problems (detecting SYN <b>Flooding,</b> <b>Port</b> Scans, Connection Hijacking, and content matching across fragments) require per-flow state. Our theory exposes assumptions that need to be changed to provide scalable solutions to these problems; we conclude with some systems techniques to circumvent these lower bounds...|$|R

30|$|IP {{networks}} are constantly targeted by new techniques of {{denial of service}} attacks (SYN <b>flooding,</b> <b>port</b> scan, UDP <b>flooding,</b> etc), causing service disruption and considerable financial damage. The on-line detection of DoS attacks in the current high-bit rate IP traffic is a big challenge. We propose in this paper an on-line algorithm for port scan detection. It is composed of two complementary parts: First, a probabilistic counting part, where the number of distinct destination ports is estimated by adapting a method called ‘sliding HyperLogLog’ to the context of port scan in IP traffic. Second, a decisional mechanism is performed on the estimated number of destination ports in order to detect in real time any behavior that {{could be related to}} a malicious traffic. This latter part is mainly based on the exponentially weighted moving average algorithm (EWMA) that we adapted to the context of on-line analysis by adding a learning step (supposed without attacks) and improving its update mechanism. The obtained port scan detecting method is tested against real IP traffic containing some attacks. It detects all the port scan attacks within a very short time response (of about 30 s) and without any false positive. The algorithm uses a very small total memory of less than 22 kb and has a very good accuracy on the estimation of the number of destination ports (a relative error of about 3.25 %), which is in agreement with the theoretical bounds provided by the sliding HyperLogLog algorithm.|$|R
