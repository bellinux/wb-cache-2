5|$|Against {{the advice}} of Captain Dove, Paxton {{continued}} to advance the regiment. The element of surprise was gone, and it was dark. Dove knew the probability of being attacked was high, and he took steps to minimize the danger to the main column. The advance guard was ambushed around 1:00 am on May 2. Dove received a severe wound on <b>his</b> <b>foot,</b> <b>and</b> two of his men were killed. The regiment's total losses were four killed, eight wounded, and four missing—plus 28 horses killed. Paxton, who was popular with the regiment, was dismissed by General Eliakim P. Scammon after the regiment returned to camp.|$|E
5|$|As {{the final}} {{was held in}} England, at Wembley, Liverpool were clear favourites to retain the European Cup. Brugge were without {{a number of key}} players, such as Raoul Lambert, whose {{inclusion}} in the Brugge squad was rumoured before the final but never materialised. Liverpool were also without a few players. Tommy Smith, who had scored in the previous season's final, was out after dropping a pick-axe on <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> breaking a toe. Striker David Johnson was also absent. He had strained knee ligaments during a match against Leicester City, an injury that ruled him out {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|In October 1843, future California {{governor}} Peter H. Burnett recounted a {{story of}} an aboriginal American man who badly burned <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> leg in lava or hot ash while hunting for deer. The likely apocryphal story went that the injured man sought treatment at Fort Vancouver, but the contemporary fort commissary steward, Napoleon McGilvery, disclaimed knowledge of the incident. British lieutenant Henry J. Warre sketched the eruption in 1845, {{and two years later}} Canadian painter Paul Kane created watercolors of the gently smoking mountain. Warre's work showed erupting material from a vent {{about a third of the}} way down from the summit on the mountain's west or northwest side (possibly at Goat Rocks), and one of Kane's field sketches shows smoke emanating from about the same location.|$|E

5|$|The {{second quarter}} began with Clemson in {{possession}} of the ball and facing third and two at its 46-yard line. The Tigers gained a first down with the first play of the quarter, a four-yard rush by Zachery. From midfield, Dantzler threw an incomplete pass then ran for no gain. On third down, Dantzler completed a long pass to Justin Watts, who gained a first down at the Tech 23-yard line. On the next play, Dantzler completed a pass to Zachery, who ran {{into the end zone}} for Clemson's first points of the game. During the play, Zachery broke <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> was kept out {{of the rest of the}} game. The extra point was good, and the Tigers narrowed Tech's lead to 147 with 13:34 remaining in the first half.|$|E
5|$|By lap 105, Kyle Busch held a 3.1-second {{lead over}} Kenseth. Three laps later, the third caution was {{triggered}} when Stewart's car made heavy {{contact with the}} turn-two wall after his right-front tire burst. Stewart grazed <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> climbed out of his car; emergency workers helped take him to a waiting car that {{took him to the}} infield medical center for further examination. All of the race leaders, including Edwards, chose to make pit stops for tires and car adjustments under caution. NASCAR required Edwards to fall back {{to the end of the}} longest line because one of his crew members had allowed one of his tires to roll away from his pit box during his stop. Kyle Busch maintained the lead at the restart on lap 114; he was followed by Kenseth and Gordon. Kenseth passed Kyle Busch to take the lead on lap 117. On the same lap, Gordon passed Busch. By lap 135, Kenseth had opened up a 2.2-second lead over Gordon. Biffle moved in front of Burton for fourth place on the 139th lap. On lap 144, Robby Gordon's right-front tire blew, causing him to hit the turn-two wall, and the fourth caution was triggered. All of the race leaders made pit stops during the caution.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 {{recruiting}} {{class was}} ranked 52nd {{in the nation}} by Scout.com and 38th by Rivals.com. Scout.com rated three recruits as four-star and six as three-star prospects, while Rivals.com rated six recruits each as four-star and three-star prospects. Kenny Tate, who was originally recruited as a wide receiver, was the only four-star prospect to see significant playing time in 2008. Before the season, he was converted to safety, a position that had been attrited by the graduation of former starters Christian Varner and J.J. Justice, and Tate also saw action on special teams. Cornerback Cameron Chism, who saw action in nine games as a reserve, recorded seven tackles on kickoff returns to tie for second on the team in special teams tackles. Tight end Matt Furstenburg saw limited play time on special teams against Delaware and Middle Tennessee, but injured <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> was awarded a medical redshirt. Wide receiver Kevin Dorsey also sat out the season as a redshirt to recuperate from foot surgery. The other four-star recruits who sat out on redshirt status were wide receiver Kerry Boykins, tight end Devonte Campbell, and defensive tackle Masengo Kabongo. Running back Davin Meggett, the son of former New York Giants star Dave Meggett, was the only true freshman to start a game for Maryland in 2008, {{and he was a}} significant contributor throughout the season. Meggett was not a highly touted recruit, assessed by Scout.com as a two-star prospect, and his only other scholarship offers were from local-area Division I FCS schools. In 2008, however, he led all ACC freshman with 5.13yards per carry, and Megett finished the season with 457yards and four touchdowns as a reserve.|$|E

25|$|Day Three: In a {{remarkable}} day's play South Africa reached 459 all out, after Duminy (166) and Steyn (76) put on 180 {{for the ninth}} wicket - the third highest all-time. Brett Lee didn't take the field all day due to a stress fracture in <b>his</b> <b>foot,</b> <b>and</b> Australia was left with three front-line bowlers and their part-timers.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{graduation}} from Oxford, Donnelly commenced working for Courtaulds while playing cricket for Warwickshire. In 1948, playing for Warwickshire against Middlesex, he was bowled by left-arm spinner Jack Young {{from the wrong}} side of the stumps, the ball having bounced off <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> over his head before landing behind the stumps and spinning back to dislodge the bails.|$|E
25|$|During the Chechens {{withdrawal}} from Grozny in January 2000 Basayev lost a foot after stepping on {{a land mine}} while leading his men through a minefield. The operation to amputate <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> part of his leg was videotaped by Adam Tepsurgayev and later televised by Russia's NTV network and Reuters, showing his foot being removed by Khassan Baiev using a local anaesthetic while Basayev watched impassively.|$|E

25|$|Van Persie's {{good form}} {{at the start}} of the 2005–06 season earned him the Player of the Month award for November 2005 after eight goals in eight starts, and he was rewarded with a five-year {{contract}} extension until 2011 on 4 January. Two days after signing the contract, however, van Persie was again hit by injury when an opponent stepped on <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> broke his toe during an FA Cup match against Cardiff.|$|E
25|$|Burbeck {{hoped that}} his son Henry would follow in his {{military}} footsteps, but Henry died {{when he tried to}} test his strength by lifting a keg of silver dollars which fell on <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> severed his toe while at sea on a revenue cutter. By the time the cutter reached New York and a physician was summoned, it was too late and he died. Thereafter, Gen. Burbeck was so overcome by grief that he would not have his son's name spoken in his house.|$|E
25|$|Hodge {{tried to}} hook the ball clear but miscued it. The ball screwed off <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> into the penalty area, toward Maradona, who had {{continued}} his run. England goalkeeper Peter Shilton {{came out of}} his goal to punch the ball clear. Maradona, despite being 8 inches (20cm) shorter than the 6-foot-1 (1.85m) Shilton, reached it first with his outside left hand. The ball went into the goal. Referee Ali Bin Nasser of Tunisia claimed he did not see the infringement and allowed the goal.|$|E

25|$|Quinn {{returned}} to resume drumming duties on this tour. Midway through the tour however, lead guitarist Nathan Connolly badly sprained <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> ankle. Though {{it was not}} possible for him to put any weight on his foot, the management assured fans that no shows would be cancelled and Connolly would most likely be sitting in the shows. The tour began in February end and continued till mid-April, after which the band headed to Japan to play shows that had been re-scheduled from February.|$|E
25|$|For {{most of the}} 2007–08 season, Forsberg was an {{unrestricted}} free agent {{and said that he}} would not return to the NHL. He had surgery on <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> was waiting {{to see if he was}} in condition to play. He said that in Europe, he would only play for Modo Hockey, and in the NHL he would probably play for one of his former three clubs. On 25 February 2008, Forsberg signed a contract with the Colorado Avalanche for the rest of the 2007–08 season.|$|E
25|$|Chesney {{started his}} Poets and Pirates Tour on April 26, 2008 at Williams-Brice Stadium in Columbia, South Carolina. During the {{introduction}} of his set, his boot got caught between a hydraulic lift and {{the lip of the}} stage surface, which crushed <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> produced a severe hematoma from the ankle down, with most of the damage centering within his toes. It took approximately 30seconds to pry his foot loose as he squatted down on the stage while the band continued to play an extended introduction of the song. When Chesney finally freed himself, he stood up and kept holding his hand on his knee as he began singing.|$|E

25|$|With four {{appearances}} in Premier League matches during the season, as of 9 January 2007 {{he had played}} 37 times for Arsenal, 25 as a substitute, scoring nine goals, all but one coming in the League Cup, four against West Brom. In the January 2007 transfer window, Aliadière was linked with a move to the Premier League club Middlesbrough in North East England, after Wenger {{said he would be}} allowed to leave the club. The move, however, failed to happen after Robin van Persie broke <b>his</b> <b>foot,</b> <b>and</b> he was told to stay at Arsenal for the time being. He made his final Arsenal appearance {{on the final day of}} the 2006–07 season against Portsmouth in a 0–0 draw at Fratton Park.|$|E
25|$|Folklore {{seems to}} have favoured the loser {{in the battle of}} the giants, as Goram is commemorated in the {{features}} Goram’s Chair and Footprint (some versions seem to treat these as the same thing, saying that the Chair was formed by the giant stamping <b>his</b> <b>foot)</b> <b>and</b> Soap-Dish in the gorge of the Hazel Brook. Perhaps the nearby feature Lover’s Leap also recalls the legend, but this is a conventional name for precipices which often have unsubstantiated tales of lovers' suicides attached. A pub of the early 1960s on the Lawrence Weston housing estate in west Bristol is called The Giant Goram, and there was formerly (from about 1954 sporadically to 1996) a funfair bearing Goram’s name on the Blaise Castle landed estate (by then in the hands of Bristol City Council) in Henbury.|$|E
25|$|During {{his time}} in Greece, Green's {{presence}} as well his ability {{to connect with the}} soldiers under his command endeared him to his men who followed him unquestioningly. This was noted by his peers, and he was marked him down for quick promotion. After reforming in Palestine, Green's battalion then was sent to undertake garrison duties in Syria and Ceylon, before finally returning to Australia in August 1942. Having injured <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> contracting typhoid while in Ceylon, when the 2/2nd was sent to New Guinea, Green was again unable to join them. In December, having been substantively promoted to major in September, he was posted as an instructor to the First Army's Junior Tactical School in Southport, Queensland. He married Edna Olwyn Warner at St Paul's Anglican Church, Ulmarra, New South Wales, on 30 January 1943.|$|E
