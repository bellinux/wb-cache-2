40|$|The brown crab or <b>European</b> <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> Cancer pagurus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{economically}} important crab species in European waters with landings of 49 263 t in 2013. C. pagurus is also one of the most important commercial species in the United Kingdom with landings of 28 778 t in 2013 worth approximately £ 33. 5 M at first sale. The global capture production of brown crab has increased markedly during the last two decades. Despite this, the crab fishery is relatively data poor in terms of the ecology and catch characteristics of this species, particularly in the Irish Sea. The aims of this study were to provide the information to fill science gaps needed to inform sustainable brown crab fisheries in the Isle of Man. This was done by studying the population structure, reproductive ecology and catch characteristics of the brown crab fishery, and by examining the impacts of scallop fisheries on brown crabs, as well as assessing the by-catch composition of the brown crab pot fishery. A combination of sampling techniques was used to collect data which included: baited pots between Spring 2012 and Summer 2013, dredge, trawl and shore surveys. The catch per unit effort (CPUE) of crabs caught in traps was strongly influenced by environmental (i. e., temperature, season, area) and fishery specific factors (i. e., pot volume). This study compared fishery dependent data (FDD) and fishery independent data (FID) to assess the CPUE estimates. Both of these data sources gave similar results which indicated that fisher-based surveys provide good quality information for future monitoring of the population provided that environmental and gear effects are accounted for. This study also determined the total exploitation rate of brown crab using both commercial and recreational fisheries data. The latter contributed only a small percentage of total mortality which is largely due to strict controls on total recreational fishing effort. Observations of the distribution of brown crabs around the Isle of Man indicated the presence of a reproductive migration. Ovigerous crabs were generally found in offshore areas. These egg carrying females varied in size from 134 to 215 mm CW and each individual carried an estimated 0. 4 - 3. 0 million eggs. However, examination of behavioural maturity indicated that the earliest presence of sperm plugs was at 110 mm CW while functional maturity was 134 mm CW. There appears to be a predictable trend across Europe in the minimum size of egg bearing which appears to be related to water temperature. Based on quantitative data collected throughout the dredge surveys the potential impact of scallop dredging on the brown crab population was estimated in terms of by-catch, damage and mortality estimates. This study indicated that female crabs were particularly vulnerable to scallop dredging around the North-West coast of the island in November when fishing effort was highest in this area. Estimates of the potential mortality associated with scallop dredging led to a lower and higher estimate of a potential annual crab by-catch mortality of between 11 t and 17 t respectively (assuming 45...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Aerosolisation of {{components}} when processing king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) and <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> (Cancer pagurus) may cause occupational health problems when inhaled by workers. Methods: A cross-sectional study {{was carried out}} in three king crab plants and one <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> plant. Personal exposure measurements were performed throughout work shifts. Air was collected for measurement of tropomyosin, total protein, endotoxin, trypsin and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase). T-tests and ANOVAs were used to compare the levels of exposure in the different plants and areas in the plants. Results: Total protein and tropomyosin levels were highest in the <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> plant, endotoxin levels were highest in king crab plants. King crab exposure levels were highest during raw processing. Tropomyosin levels were highest during raw king crab processing with geometric mean (GM) 9. 6 ng/m 3 vs 2. 5 ng/m 3 during cooked processing. Conversely, <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> tropomyosin levels were highest during cooked processing with GM 45. 4 ng/m 3 vs 8. 7 ng/m 3 during raw processing. Endotoxin levels were higher in king crab plants than in the <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> plant with GM= 6285. 5 endotoxin units (EU) /m 3 vs 72 EU/m 3. In the <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> plant, NAGase levels were highest during raw processing with GM= 853 pmol 4 - methylumbelliferone (MU) /m 3 vs 422 pmol 4 -MU/m 3 during cooked processing. Trypsin activity was found in both king <b>crab</b> and <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> plants and levels were higher in raw than cooked processing. Differences in exposure levels between plants and worker groups (raw and cooked processing) were identified Conclusions: Norwegian crab processing workers are exposed to airborne proteins, tropomyosin, endotoxins, trypsin and NAGase in their breathing zone.

40|$|Occupational {{asthma and}} allergy are health {{problems}} {{found in the}} seafood processing industry. The aim of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} exposure to central components in bioaerosols collected in the breathing zone of crab processing workers, and explore the workers’ prevalence of respiratory symptoms and sensitisation to crustacean allergens. This thesis describes the exposure levels of total protein, tropomyosin, trypsin, NAGase and endotoxin in king <b>crab</b> and <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> processing plants. This work establishes that both king <b>crab</b> and <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> processing workers are exposed to bioaerosols containing these components. When comparing king <b>crab</b> and <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> processing, king crab processing results in highest levels of endotoxin while <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> processing has the highest levels of tropomyosin and total protein. Differences in exposure levels between the king crab processing plants suggesting a plant effect where local differences in production, ventilation and plant layout is important for the exposure to bioaerosols. This work also describes the increased prevalence of respiratory symptoms among crab processing workers compared to a non-exposed control group. However, there is little difference between exposed workers and controls in lung function parameters. The control group has an increased prevalence of self-reported asthma and allergy compared to the crab processing workers. Furthermore, this work demonstrates elevated IgE and positive skin prick test results among both king <b>crab</b> and <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> workers. Immunoblots also show that workers are sensitised to several allergens, including tropomyosin, arginine kinase, enolase and hemocyanin. The low prevalence of asthma and allergy despite the presence of respiratory symptoms and sensitisation suggests a healthy worker effect where unhealthy individuals are excluded from the workforce. It causes an underestimation of the health effects of working in the plant...|$|R

40|$|In annual surveys {{conducted}} during the period 2012 – 2015, concentrations of the toxic or essential elements B, Se, Cd, Sn, Cs, Hg, Pb, Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, and As were analyzed in brown meat of <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> (Cancer pagurus), and filets of cod (Gadus morhua) and halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) {{in one of the}} most important commercial crab fishing areas in Norway, at Mausund in Frøya municipality in Sør-Trøndelag, Norway. Concentrations of the elements were analyzed in sediments in 2015. Several salmon farms are located in this area. Samples were extracted by HNO 3 and analyzed using Inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Crab, cod, and halibut were caught in a total of five locations. One of these locations was in the proximity of a salmon farm. In <b>edible</b> <b>crabs,</b> the mean ranks were significantly different between two locations only for Sn (p= 0. 034). When all data were pooled, the mean ranks statistics showed significant difference between all years for the elements Se (p= < 0. 001), Cs (p= 0. 005), Mn (p= 0. 002), Zn (p= 0. 006), and As (p= 0. 001) in <b>edible</b> <b>crab.</b> The study showed elevated levels of Cd in <b>edible</b> <b>crabs</b> in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, with the highest levels in 2015.

40|$|Regular {{consumption}} of seafood {{has been widely}} recommended by authorities. Yet, some species accumulate high levels of contaminants like Hg, Cd and As. In addition, the risks associated to the {{consumption of}} such seafood may increase if consumers use cooking practices that enhance the concentration of contaminants and their bioaccessibility. In this study, the bioaccessibility of Hg, Cd and As was assessed with in vitro human digestion of raw and cooked black scabbard fish (Hg; steamed, fried and grilled) and <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> (Cd and As; steamed and boiled) tissues. Additionally, the toxicological hazards associated with the consumption of these products were also discussed. Generally, Hg, Cd and As bioacessibility increased throughout the digestion process. Cadmium and As revealed high bioaccessibility rates in raw and cooked samples (up to 100 %), whereas lower bioaccessible fractions of Hg was observed (up to 40 %). Furthermore, this study pointed out the importance of food matrix, elemental chemical properties and cooking practices in the bioaccessibility of Hg, Cd and As. The toxicological hazards revealed that <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> brown meat (Cd) and grilled black scabbard fish (MeHg) consumption in children should be moderated. In contrast, <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> muscle (Cd) and fried or steamed black scabbard fish (MeHg) should be consumed to minimize exposure.
