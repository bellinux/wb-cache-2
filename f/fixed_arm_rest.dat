5000|$|Several minor {{engineering}} {{changes were}} made for '58, including revisions to the suspension and driveshaft that finally allowed designers to create a three-passenger rear seat. Earlier models had seating for only two passengers in the rear because the high driveshaft [...] "hump" [...] necessitated dividing the seat; a <b>fixed</b> <b>arm</b> <b>rest</b> (later made removable because of customer requests) was placed between the rear passengers in earlier models.|$|E
50|$|The Sera is a 2+2 {{hatchback}} coupe with bucket {{seats at}} the front and a rear bench seat with a <b>fixed</b> central <b>arm</b> <b>rest.</b> Both front seats tilt and slide forward to give access to the rear, and, although the interior is quite compact, the deep, form-fitting design of the rear seats means the vehicle can provide space (albeit cramped) in the back for passengers of average height. The front seats in all versions came with three-point harnesses while the rear seats came with either two-point lap sashes or three-point harnesses depending on the Phase. It is in {{the specifics of the}} interior {{that the majority of the}} differences in Phases occurs as outlined below.|$|R
40|$|Problem Statement: Despite {{the fact}} that falls {{comprise}} {{a large percentage of}} hospital injuries, little is known quantitatively about what induces patient falls, particularly with regard to hospital bed ingress/egress and bedside transitions. This is concerning since many studies conclude that over 50 % of falls occur during activities related to leaving the bed and during in-room patient ambulation. Objective: Since most fall studies to date have focused on qualitative measurements and assessments, the focus of our study was to quantify key temporal/spatial gait parameters in a fall-prone population during hospital bed egress. Methods: Fourteen older adults (72. 5 +/- 10. 1 years) were recruited with a history of falls (Morse Fall Scale value> 50). An 18 -camera motion tracking system (NaturalPoint, Corvallis, OR) was used to track full-body biomechanics. Participants exited an adjustable, instrumented hospital bed without side rails at three bed heights calculated as a percentage of their lower leg length. Movements consisted of sit-to-stand transition and short ambulation from the bedside to a chair. As a control, the same events were captured from the chair (<b>fixed</b> height with <b>arm</b> <b>rests)</b> to the bed. Results: Time to first step initiation (TFSI), defined as first toe-off following sit-to-stand, and time to first step (TFS), defined as first heel strike, showed significant differences in high bed and low bed condition...|$|R

5000|$|The Latin solium is {{considered}} to be equivalent to the Greek term thronos and thus is often translated as “throne.” [...] These were like modern chairs, with backs and <b>arm</b> <b>rests.</b> Three types of solia based on Greek prototypes are distinguished by Richter: thrones with “turned” and “rectangular” legs and grandiose thrones with solid sides, of which several examples survive in stone. [...] In addition, a type with a high back and <b>arms,</b> <b>resting</b> upon a cylindrical or conical base, is said to derive from Etruscan prototypes.|$|R
