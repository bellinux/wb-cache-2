25|$|Alessandro Lessona (Minister of Mussolini's government), {{a friend}} of mine at the time, paid to you more than 4 million English Pounds from 1925 to 1931. <b>Even</b> <b>I</b> had the right to act, I never asked for my part. That money, as anyone in Albania knows, have been washed by the blood of patriots as Bajram Curri, Hasan Prishtina, Luigj Gurakuqi, and {{thousand}} of them.|$|E
500|$|.....as I {{began to}} research, <b>even</b> <b>I,</b> {{as someone who}} had been paying {{attention}} {{to some of these}} sorts of things {{for a long time and}} was open to alternative explanations, <b>even</b> <b>I</b> was fairly astonished when I put it together, basically by going county by county and finding the criminal arrest records and the jail records in county after county after county from this period of time and seeing that if there had been crime waves, there had to have been records of crimes and people being arrested for crimes. And in reality, it's just not there."There's no evidence that that ever happened. In fact, it's the opposite. The crime waves that occurred by and large were the aftermath of the war and whites coming back from fighting in the Civil War and settling scores with people and all sorts of renegade activity that didn't involve black people at all, but they were blamed for it, and that was then used as a kind of ruse for why these incredibly brutal new legal measures then began to be put in place." ...|$|E

500|$|Moore named William S. Burroughs {{as one of}} {{his main}} {{influences}} during the conception of Watchmen. He admired Burroughs' use of [...] "repeated symbols that would become laden with meaning" [...] in Burroughs' only comic strip, [...] "The Unspeakable Mr. Hart", which appeared in the British underground magazine Cyclops. Not every intertextual link in the series was planned by Moore, who remarked that [...] "there's stuff in there Dave had put in that <b>even</b> <b>I</b> only noticed on the sixth or seventh read", while other [...] "things [...] turned up in there by accident." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] was sequenced as {{the final}} track on Revolver, which EMI's Parlophone label issued on 5 August 1966. In his design for the LP cover, Klaus Voormann drew {{inspiration}} from the song, recognising the need for artwork that would capture the Beatles' new direction and the avant-garde aspect of the recording. Voormann later said that he found [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] "frightening", adding that it was [...] "so {{far away from the}} early Beatles stuff that <b>even</b> <b>I</b> myself thought, well, the normal kind of Beatles fan won't want to buy this record. But they did." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Paul Mavis of DVD Talk said [...] " [...] a nicely worked-out story and strong, integrated gags. He added [...] "it's a particularly well-crafted entry." [...] C. S. Strowbridge of The Numbers said [...] "There {{are a number}} of funny gags on this double-length short, but it feels padded. It's also heavy-handed. I do like that they have a message to go with the jokes, {{but it would have been}} more effective if it were more subtle." [...] Josh Rode of DVD Verdict described the episode as [...] "decent". Shannon Gosney of The Mommy-Files said [...] "there were many parts where my boys just burst out laughing. <b>Even</b> <b>I</b> found myself laughing at times." ...|$|E

500|$|Shearsmith {{identified}} [...] "The Riddle of the Sphinx" [...] {{as one of}} his two favourite {{episodes of}} the series, along with [...] "The Devil of Christmas". For the writers, the episode was not comedic, and they expressed awareness of the differences between episodes of Inside No. 9 like [...] "The Riddle of the Sphinx" [...] and the expectations of viewers for television comedies. The pair acknowledged the particular complexity of the plot, with Pemberton saying [...] "If you missed two sentences in a row, you'd be like 'what?' <b>Even</b> <b>I</b> was thinking how are people following this? It's insane." [...] Pemberton also noted that not everyone enjoys crosswords, hence [...] "I always hated cryptic crosswords. Why can't people just say what they mean instead of trying to trick you all the time?" [...] from Shearsmith's Tyler.|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast, [...] "Son of a Gun" [...] {{was seen by}} 6.52 million viewers, ranking third in its time slot among major television networks. The episode received a 7 rating/10 share, which continued a downward trend in Homicide ratings since the January 31 post-Super Bowl series premiere, [...] "Gone for Goode". [...] "Son of a Gun" [...] lost ratings in large part due to a live Oprah Winfrey 90-minute interview with pop singer Michael Jackson, which aired on ABC and was seen by 36.59 million people, the fourth-highest total recorded by an entertainment program at the time since 1960. Yaphet Kotto said of the scheduling, [...] ""Heck, on that night, <b>even</b> <b>I</b> was watching Oprah instead of our show." [...] Homicide also lost in its time slot to a cast reunion of The Andy Griffith Show, which aired on CBS and attracted 11.36 million viewers.|$|E

500|$|Cast member Wil Wheaton rewatched {{the episode}} for AOL TV in November 2006. He criticised {{the writing of}} Fontana in this episode, saying that around this time she {{appeared}} on a panel at a convention about how to solve [...] "The Wesley Problem", but when rewatching the episode he thought that [...] "maybe instead of sitting on this panel and trashing me, D.C Fontana could have written intelligent dialogue for me and helped solve the [...] "Wesley problem" [...] herself. I don't know, maybe she {{tried to do that}} and didn't get a lot of support {{from the rest of the}} producers and writing staff, but <b>even</b> <b>I</b> know of Dr. Channing's theory of not writing cliched dialogue for kids in science fiction, and then blaming the actor who is forced to deliver it." [...] Overall he criticised the [...] "very stiff" [...] dialogue throughout the episode, and called the set-up [...] "incredibly forced". He did highlight that Data acting out as Sherlock Holmes laid the foundation of future episodes which would expand on this.|$|E
500|$|Viewers saw {{the slow}} {{build-up}} to Pauline's climactic exit throughout {{the latter part}} of 2006. The character's bitter decline involves depression, pretending to have a brain tumour to scupper the revived relationship between her son Martin and his ex-wife Sonia, marital breakdown, and finally ostracism after Martin and the rest of Albert Square discover her lie. Having successfully alienated everyone around her, Pauline plans to go to America to join her daughter. Wendy Richard commented on the reasons behind Pauline's actions: [...] "she cannot forgive. For anyone to hurt a member of her family so badly is incomprehensible to Pauline. She is a good, but unforgiving woman. Sonia {{is more than just a}} thorn in Pauline's side. She is angry because she feels Martin has let her down in returning to Sonia. She feels he could have discussed it with her more and talked her round for the sake of Rebecca. Pauline will blame her decision to leave on Sonia—another way of punishing Martin. Even though she is really hurting over leaving Rebecca, Pauline is determined to go. She realised she never really loved Joe, he has lied to her too many times... Although I know Pauline better than anyone, <b>even</b> <b>I</b> cannot fathom out why she made up the brain tumour story." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{production}} began, the team's {{first task}} {{was to develop a}} new game engine—one that could display a true 3D environment and allow for advanced gameplay. The team abandoned the engine used for the Ultima Underworld games and coded one from scratch in Watcom C/C++, using 32-bit code. The new engine is capable of processing texture maps, sloped architecture and light-emitting objects; and it allows the player to look in any direction, whereas Ultima Underworlds engine was [...] "very limited" [...] in this regard. It also enables the player character to jump, crawl, climb walls and lean, among other things. The designers utilized loopholes in the engine's renderer to create more diverse and striking environments. Despite having coded the renderer, Church said that [...] "at first glance <b>even</b> <b>I</b> couldn't see how they did them". However, this added to the performance issues already being caused by the engine's advanced nature, and the team struggled to optimize the game throughout development. 3D polygonal character models were planned, but they could not be implemented on schedule. Church said that the team's ultimate goal was to create a [...] "rich, exciting, active environment" [...] in which the player could be immersed, and that this required [...] "a coherent story and a world that you can interact with as much as possible." ...|$|E

500|$|In the verses, Spears sings {{about being}} {{in love with a}} bad boy and outlaw, in lyrics such as [...] "He is a hustler / He's no good at all / He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum" [...] and [...] "He is a bad boy with a tainted heart / And <b>even</b> <b>I</b> know this ain't smart". During the chorus, she pleads to her mother not to worry in lines such as [...] "But mama I'm in love with a criminal" [...] and [...] "Mama please don't cry / I will be alright." [...] Andrew Leahey of The Washington Times and Erin Thompson of the Seattle Weekly {{compared}} the lyrics to those of Madonna's [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] (1986), while David Bunachan compared them to Coolio's [...] "Mama I'm in Love Wit' a Gangsta" [...] (1994). The words in the chorus end in 'al's syllables, as evident in lyrics such as [...] "And this type of love isn't rational / It's physical". Keith Caufield noted that they were an unintentional nod to Supertramp's [...] "The Logical Song" [...] (1979). Thompson stated that Spears's vocals are less processed than {{on the rest of the}} album, while according to Amy Sciarretto they are [...] "heavily auto-tuned and studio-treated, [...] she delivers her lines in a monotone, robotic fashion." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{announced}} on 7 November 2007 that Abra would again {{be returning to}} Holby City, in spring 2008. Edmondson revealed that [...] "Abra comes back as a patient because some trauma has happened in Africa {{and he will be}} sponging off Ric." [...] Expanding on this, he explained: [...] "Abra’s in a very fragile state, as he’s suffering from post-traumatic stress. He keeps hurting himself, but no one knows why. Ric’s pretty off with Abra at first, but he agrees to let him stay at his place for a week. Abra used to be a nice guy, but he’s horrible now. Something happened to him on his travels, though <b>even</b> <b>I</b> haven’t been told what it is yet. What I do know is that Abra has a huge machete scar on his back... I imagine he’s been though some horror." [...] He has stated that this appearance in the show will last four or five months, and that he doesn't yet know how the character will be written out this time, beyond there being [...] "some kind of mental-health issue." [...] It emerged that Abra had borne witness to a violent attack on the hospital he was working in the Congo, eventually leading to him checking into a psychiatric unit. After being discovered being treated by his own mother, Kyla and Lola Griffin convinced him to discharge himself and return to Ghana. He returned briefly to Holby in December 2008, when he convinced Kyla to move to Ghana with him, proposing marriage to her.|$|E
500|$|Against Boston College, {{running back}} Da'Rel Scott handled {{some of the}} kickoff return duties, but Smith {{returned}} two for 38yards. He also caught eight passes for 34yards and a touchdown. The following week, Maryland clinched bowl eligibility with a 62–14 rout of Wake Forest. Regarding the turnaround from the previous season's 2–10 record, Smith said, [...] "We {{expected to be in}} this position. No one else expected it," [...] but added [...] "No one is going to respect us [...] because we have not beaten any top dogs." [...] In the game, Smith had five catches for 66yards, including a 17-yard touchdown reception. Before the game against Miami, the coaching staff reported Smith's ankle had improved and he was [...] "as healthy as he has been in a while." [...] Against Miami, he had three receptions for 35yards. Smith also compiled 46yards on two kickoff returns to break the ACC career kickoff return yards record with 2,724 yards, which surpassed the previous mark of 2,688 yards held by Brandon Tate of North Carolina. At Virginia, Smith took advantage of the Cavaliers' man-to-man coverage and had seven receptions for 157yards, including a 12-yard touchdown. On a 62-yard catch, he said he was tackled on the seven-yard line only because he was exhausted. Quarterback Danny O'Brien expressed his readiness to throw deep passes to Smith in single coverage, [...] "If it's <b>even,</b> <b>I</b> put it up." [...] Maryland entered the game against 25th-ranked Florida State in contention for the ACC Atlantic Division championship. Smith recorded a phone message and video appealing to fans in a bid to improve home attendance, which had been lackluster throughout the season. The game was attended by 48,115 spectators, which surpassed the athletic department's projections. Maryland lost, 30–16, and Smith had seven receptions for 69yards.|$|E
