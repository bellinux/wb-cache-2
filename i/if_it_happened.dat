5|$|The ANC {{threatened}} to withdraw support for South Africa's next test match against Australia, {{which could have}} led to the cancellation the match due to safety concerns and Australia stated they would not play if the match didn't have ANC support. However, the future South African sports minister Steve Tshwete asked for the ANC to give the supporters another chance and the ANC did not withdraw their support. Instead they issued a warning that <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> again they would oppose all future tours and the 1995 Rugby World Cup.|$|E

25|$|The {{curator at}} Old Trafford {{had been ordered}} to prepare a dusty, {{spinning}} pitch that was devoid of grass for the Fourth Test. A win for England would see them retain the Ashes. England's chairman of selectors and former captain Gubby Allen thought that the pitch would fall apart by tea on the first morning; the surface had already cracked {{before the start of}} play. When the curator asked Allen if he would like the remaining grass removed, he indicated {{that he would not be}} sad <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened,</b> so the groundsmen cut what remained of the grass. The umpires felt that the match would be over within three days. Miller bowled 21 wicketless overs for 41 runs as England amassed 459 on the deteriorating and crumbling pitch. Australia began batting after lunch on the second day, and the pace pair of Brian Statham and Trevor Bailey only bowled then overs to remove the shine from the ball before Laker and Lock took over.|$|E

25|$|St. Brendan is chiefly {{renowned for}} his legendary {{journey to the}} Isle of the Blessed as {{described}} in the ninth century Voyage of St Brendan the Navigator. Many versions exist that tell of how he set out onto the Atlantic Ocean with sixteen ]s (other versions have fourteen, plus three unbelievers who join at the last minute) searching for the Garden of Eden. One of these companions {{is said to have been}} Saint Malo, the namesake of Saint-Malo. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened,</b> this would have occurred sometime between AD 512–530, before his travel to the island of Great Britain. On his trip, Brendan is supposed to have seen Saint Brendan's Island, a blessed island covered with vegetation. He also encountered a sea monster, an adventure he shared with his contemporary Saint Columba. The most commonly illustrated adventure is his landing on an island which turns out to be a giant sea monster called Jasconius or Jascon. This too, has its parallels in other stories, not only in Irish mythology but in other traditions, from Sinbad the Sailor to Pinocchio.|$|E
25|$|Before {{playing in}} the NHL, Sheldon {{was a member of}} the Fort Saskatchewan Traders in the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL). He was drafted in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft in the third round, 71st overall, by the New Jersey Devils.Souray {{reported}} to his second Devils training camp overweight and out-of-shape, prompting general manager Lou Lamoriello called him embarrassing, and that he would never play for the team <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> again. Souray credits Lamoriello for calling him out, and says it was exactly what he needed to succeed at such a high level. He made his NHL debut in the 1997–98 season. He finished his rookie season with modest scoring totals of three goals and ten points in 60 games, but most importantly established that he was capable of being an NHL regular. He scored his first NHL goal on a powerful slapshot late in a December 16, 1997, game against the rival New York Rangers to break a 3–3 tie late in the third period and send the Devils to a 4–3 win. Souray played in New Jersey from 1997 to midway through the 1999–2000 season, earning a reputation as a big, steady, physical defender with a mean streak and a hard shot. However, with the Devils preparing to make their Stanley Cup run late in the 1999–2000 season and believing they needed more offence from the blue line, Souray was traded to the Montreal Canadiens on March 1, 2000, in exchange for Vladimir Malakhov.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, R. G. Harrison, a {{professor}} of anatomy, used a portable x-ray machine {{to get a better}} look at the internal structures of the mummy to better determine age and cause of death of Tutankhamun. One of the most abnormal findings was the sternum (breastbone) and most parts of the frontal ribs were missing. Removing these bones was not part of the normal mummification process, which led Harrison to believe they might have been removed because they were badly damaged before his death. Harrison quickly discovered that Carter was not as careful as many of his personal notes had claimed. The mummy was not re-wrapped after 1926, which led to more deterioration due to the extremely hot external elements over the forty-two years. Also many of the limbs had been amputated in the body in order to remove some of the jewellery. Both hands were cut off, both legs were removed from the pelvis, and the head was severed from the body in order to get the mask off. Even more remarkable is the king's right ear and penis were missing, but photographs from Carter show they were both present during his examination. Harrison believed the slight curve in the spine and small bone fragments might have been the result of the embalming process. The lesion on the left jaw showed signs of healing occurred before his death and one of his legs had been broken, but it could not be determined <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> naturally or as a result of the embalming or Carter's examination. The fact that skull fragments were discovered led many to assume the king was murdered by a blow to the head, but the x-ray could not support or discredit this theory.|$|E

500|$|The Pope {{remained}} steadfastly {{determined not}} to give Edgardo up, declaring: [...] "What I have done for this boy, I had {{the right and the}} duty to do. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> again, I would do the same thing." [...] When the delegation from Rome's Jewish community attended their annual meeting at the Vatican in January 1861, they were surprised to find the nine-year-old Edgardo at the pontiff's side. The new Kingdom of Italy was proclaimed a month later with Victor Emmanuel II as king. A reduced incarnation of the Papal States, comprising Rome and its immediate environs, endured outside the new kingdom because of Napoleon III's reluctance to offend his Catholic subjects by withdrawing the French garrison. He pulled these troops out following the entrance of a Jewish child from the Roman Ghetto, nine-year-old Giuseppe Coen, to the Catechumens in 1864. The removal of the French garrison brought the Roman Question to the fore in the Italian parliament. The statesman Marco Minghetti dismissed a proposed compromise whereby Rome would become part of the kingdom with the Pope retaining some special powers, saying: [...] "we cannot go to guard the Mortara boy for the Pope". The French garrison returned in 1867, following an unsuccessful attempt by Garibaldi to capture the city.|$|E

2500|$|Ancient sources {{describe}} Callimachus's poem Ibis [...] {{which does}} not survive [...] as a polemic {{and some of them}} identified Apollonius as the target. These references conjure up images of a sensational literary feud between the two figures. Such a feud is consistent with what we know of Callimachus's taste for scholarly controversy and it might even explain why Apollonius departed for Rhodes. Thus there arises [...] "a romantic vision of scholarly warfare in which Apollonius was finally driven out of Alexandria by a triumphant Callimachus". However, both of the Lives of Apollonius stress the friendship between the poets, the second Life even saying they were buried together; moreover Callimachus's poem Ibis is known to have been deliberately obscure and some modern scholars believe the target was never meant to be identified. There is still not a consensus about the feud, but most scholars of Hellenistic literature now believe it has been enormously sensationalised, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> at all.|$|E
