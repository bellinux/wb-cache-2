40|$|INTODUCTION: Hydrocephalus {{has been}} related to Chiari type I {{malformation}} (CIM) for a long time. The pathogenesis of this association is complex and still debated. DISCUSSION: A supratentorial hypertensive hydrocephalus may cause CIM, exerting pressure from above.

In some cases, the concomitant presence of a stenosis of the jugular foramina would determine a condition of upward venous hypertension, resulting in the development of CIM and an associated hydrocephalus due to cerebellar parenchyma turgor.

The {{goal was to}} obviate the need for postnatal neurosurgery to manage this condition.

The fetuses were delivered respectively at 32 +/- 6 and 32 + 3 weeks of gestation. Their neural cords were completely covered although in small areas skin closure was incomplete.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the prenatal evolution/natural history and postnatal outcome of fetuses {{diagnosed with a}} neural tube defect (NTD) lacking the Arnold-Chiari-II malformation (ACM II). MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed 16 fetuses evaluated with ultrasound (US) and MRI at a single referral center from 1 / 2000 to 8 / 2007. Follow-up studies and available postnatal outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS: Postpartum diagnosis was terminal myelocystoceles 7 / 16 (44 %); myelomeningoceles (MMCs) 3 / 16 (19 %); lipomyelomeningoceles 2 / 16 (13 %); and thoracic myelocystocele 1 / 16 (6 %). Three patients (19 %) were lost to follow-up or termination of pregnancy. Two prenatally diagnosed 'closed' NTD were postnatally found to be MMCs. Three of the myelocystoceles had additional omphalocele, bladder extrophy, imperforate anus and spinal defect (OEIS complex). For the total cohort, impaired lower extremity function was seen in 38 %, impaired bladder function in 64 %, and ventriculoperitoneal shunting in 8 %.

OBJECTIVE: To establish the frequency of Chiari II deformity in fetuses with open spinal dysraphism, assess whether meningocele sac neck area and volume influence the severity of posterior fossa changes, and assess whether the severity of associated findings (ventriculomegaly, amount of extracerebral CSF) are associated with Chiari II deformity. METHODS: Sixty-five fetuses with open spinal dysraphism were compared with ges-tationally aged matched “normal ” fetuses on ultrafast MR images. Cerebellar vermis and bony posterior fossa surface area were measured on midline sagittal images. <b>Hindbrain</b> <b>herniation</b> was noted if present. In the open spinal dysraphic group, sac neck area and volume were measured. Ventriculomegaly was assessed by linear measurement of the trigone of the lateral ventricle and extracerebral CSF depth was measured maximally over the lateral surface of the cerebral hemispheres. RESULTS: Fifteen of 65 fetuses with open spinal dysraphism did not have Chiari II deformity. Neck area and volume of the sac did not correlate {{with the presence of}} Chiari II deformity or reduction in bony posterior fossa size. CONCLUSION: A relatively high proportion of fetuses with open spinal dysraphism do not have Chiari II deformity in utero. There is a lack of correlation between indicators of spinal dysraphism severity and the extent of the posterior fossa abnormality.

40|$|AANS, 2015. Object The Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS) was a multicenter {{randomized}} trial {{comparing the}} safety and efficacy of prenatal and postnatal closure of myelomeningocele. The trial was stopped early because of the demonstrated efficacy of prenatal surgery, and outcomes on 158 of 183 pregnancies were reported. Here, the authors update the 1 -year outcomes for the complete trial, analyze the primary and related outcomes, and evaluate whether specific prerandomization risk factors are associated with prenatal surgery benefit. Methods The primary outcome was a composite of fetal loss {{or any of the}} following: infant death, CSF shunt placement, or meeting the prespecified criteria for shunt placement. Primary outcome, actual shunt placement, and shunt revision rates for prenatal versus postnatal repair were compared. The shunt criteria were reassessed to determine which were most concordant with practice, and a new composite outcome was created from the primary outcome by replacing the original criteria for CSF shunt placement with the revised criteria. The authors used logistic regression to estimate whether there were interactions between the type of surgery and known prenatal risk factors (lesion level, gestational age, degree of <b>hindbrain</b> <b>herniation,</b> and ventricle size) for shunt placement, and to determine which factors were associated with shunting among those infants who underwent prenatal surgery. Results Ninety-one women were randomized to prenatal surgery and 92 to postnatal repair. The primary outcome occurred in 73 % of infants in the prenatal surgery group and in 98 % in the postnatal group (p < 0. 0001). Actual rates of shunt placement were only 44 % and 84 % in the 2 groups, respectively (p < 0. 0001). The authors revised the most commonly met criterion to require overt clinical signs of increased intracranial pressure, defined as split sutures, bulging fontanelle, or sunsetting eyes, in addition to increasing head circumference or hydrocephalus. Using these modified criteria, only 3 patients in each group met criteria but did not receive a shunt. For the revised composite outcome, there was a difference between the prenatal and postnatal surgery groups: 49. 5 % versus 87. 0 % (p < 0. 0001). There was also a significant {{reduction in the number of}} children who had a shunt placed and then required a revision by 1 year of age in the prenatal group (15. 4 % vs 40. 2 %, relative risk 0. 38 [95 % CI 0. 22 - 0. 66]). In the prenatal surgery group, 20 % of those with ventricle size < 10 mm at initial screening, 45. 2 % with ventricle size of 10 up to 15 mm, and 79. 0 % with ventricle size ≥ 15 mm received a shunt, whereas in the postnatal group, 79. 4 %, 86. 0 %, and 87. 5 %, respectively, received a shunt (p = 0. 02). Lesion level and degree of <b>hindbrain</b> <b>herniation</b> appeared to have no effect on the eventual need for shunting (p = 0. 19 and p = 0. 13, respectively). Similar results were obtained for the revised outcome. Conclusions Larger ventricles at initial screening are associated with an increased need for shunting among those undergoing fetal surgery for myelomeningocele. During prenatal counseling, care should be exercised in recommending prenatal surgery when the ventricles are 15 mm or larger because prenatal surgery does not appear to improve outcome in this group. The revised criteria may be useful as guidelines for treating hydrocephalus in this group. Clinical trial registration no. : NCT 00060606 (clinicaltrials. gov...|$|E
40|$|Syringomyelia {{is often}} linked to {{pathological}} lesions of the foramen magnum. The {{most common cause}} is <b>hindbrain</b> <b>herniation,</b> usually referred to as Chiari I or II malformation. Foramen magnum arachnoiditis without either Chiari I or II malformation is a rare cause of syringomyelia. The authors undertook a retrospective analysis of 21 patients with foramen magnum arachnoiditis (FMA) and syringomyelia treated between 1978 and 2000 to determine clinical course and optimum management. In the review of records, 21 patients with FMA and syringomyelia were documented. A stable clinical course was demonstrated in three patients in whom surgery was not performed, and one patient refused surgical intervention. Seventeen patients underwent 23 operations to treat progressive neurological disease. Of these 23 operations, 18 involved opening of the foramen magnum, arachnoid dissection, and placement of a large dural graft. One patient underwent insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt for treatment of accompanying hydrocephalus, one patient received a cystoperitoneal shunt for an accompanying arachnoid cyst; two syringoperitoneal and one syringosubarachnoid shunts were also inserted. Hospital and outpatient files, neuroimaging studies, and intraoperative photographic and video material were analyzed. Additional follow-up information was obtained by telephone interview and questionnaires. Standard and cardiac-gated magnetic resonance imaging studies are the diagnostic procedures of choice in these patients. Sensory disturbances, dysesthesias, and pain were the only symptoms likely to improve after foramen magnum surgery. Motor weakness and gait disturbances, which were severe in {{a considerable number of}} patients, and swallowing disorders tended to remain unchanged. As a consequence of the rather severe arachnoid lesions in most patients, clinical recurrences were observed in 57 % over a 5 -year period. Surgery for FMA and syringomyelia has to provide clear cerebrospinal fluid pathways between the cerebellopontine cisterns, spinal canal, and fourth ventricle. If this can be achieved successfully, the syrinx decreases in size and the clinical course of the patient may even improve. In patients with severe and widespread areas of arachnoiditis, however, multiple operations may be required at least to stabilize the clinical course...|$|E
40|$|This article narrates the thrilling {{story of}} how the pathogenetic {{understanding}} of myelomeningocele was fundamentally revised during the last decades and how these new insights, in particular the "two-hit hypothesis," have prepared the terrain for human fetal surgery. Formerly, the devastating cluster of neurologic and neurogenic problems was mainly attributed to the primary malformation, that is, failure of neurulation. At present, there is solid evidence that in early gestation the nonneurulated spinal cord functions well, but suffers from progressive traumatic and degenerative damage in later gestation because it is openly exposed to the amniotic cavity. There {{is no doubt that the}} secondary, in utero acquired spinal cord destruction is mainly responsible for the disastrous and irreversible peripheral neurologic deficit present at birth, and there is no doubt either that timely prenatal protective coverage can potentially arrest these deleterious dynamics and preserve neurologic function. Also, tethering of the cord within and constant outflow of cerebrospinal fluid from the lesion are seen as the driving forces behind the Chiari II malformation and consequent ventriculomegaly. Untethering and watertight sealing of the lesion reverses <b>hindbrain</b> <b>herniation</b> and lowers the risk for a relevant hydrocephalus. This article then details how human fetal surgery started in the late 1990 s and follows the evolution from the pioneer case studies via the first case series providing encouraging results to the ground breaking Management of Myelomeningocele Study Trial, published in The New England Journal of Medicine in February 2011 by Adzick et al, that has, for the first time, generated unequivocal evidence that patients with prenatal repair do significantly better than those with postnatal care only. Finally, this review looks at several other critical issues, including the hitherto immature endoscopic approach to fetal repair, some future directions of research and clinical practice, and also utters a plea for concentration of these equally rare and complex cases to a few truly qualified centers worldwide. The conclusion derived from all data existing today is that maternal-fetal surgery, although not a cure and not free of risks, represents a novel standard of care for select mothers and their fetuses suffering from one of the most ruinous nonlethal congenital malformations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This {{work is a}} {{modified}} version of the Casey Holter Memorial prize essay presented to the Society for Research into Hydrocephalus and Spina Bifida, June 29 th 2007, Heidelberg, Germany. It describes the origin and consequences of the Chiari malformation, and proposes that hydrocephalus is caused by inadequate central nervous system (CNS) venous drainage. A new hypothesis regarding the pathogenesis, anencephaly and spina bifida is described. Any volume increase in the central nervous system can increase venous pressure. This occurs because veins are compressible and a CNS volume increase may result in reduced venous blood flow. This has the potential to cause progressive increase in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume. Venous insufficiency may be caused by any disease that reduces space for venous volume. The flow of CSF has a beneficial effect on venous drainage. In health it moderates central nervous system pressure by moving between the head and spine. Conversely, obstruction to CSF flow causes localised pressure increases, which have an adverse effect on venous drainage. The Chiari malformation is associated with <b>hindbrain</b> <b>herniation,</b> which may be caused by low spinal pressure relative to cranial pressure. In these instances, there are hindbrain-related symptoms caused by cerebellar and brainstem compression. When spinal injury occurs as a result of a Chiari malformation, the primary pathology is posterior fossa hypoplasia, resulting in raised spinal pressure. The small posterior fossa prevents the flow of CSF from the spine to the head as blood enters the central nervous system during movement. Consequently, intermittent increases in spinal pressure caused by movement, result in injury to the spinal cord. It is proposed that posterior fossa hypoplasia, which has origins in fetal life, causes syringomyelia after birth and leads to damage to the spinal cord in spina bifida. It is proposed that hydrocephalus may occur as a result of posterior fossa hypoplasia, where raised pressure occurs as a result of obstruction to flow of CSF from the head to the spine, and cerebral injury with raised pressure occurs in anencephaly by this mechanism. The current view of dysraphism is that low central nervous system pressure and exposure to amniotic fluid, damage the central nervous system. The hypothesis proposed in this essay supports the view that spina bifida is a manifestation of progressive hydrocephalus in the fetus. It is proposed that that mesodermal growth insufficiency influences both neural tube closure and central nervous system pressure, leading to dysraphism. </p...|$|E
