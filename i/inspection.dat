40|$|Using data on {{injuries}} and OSHA <b>inspections</b> for 6, 842 large manufacturing plants between 1979 and 1985, we find evidence that OSHA <b>inspections</b> significantly reduce injuries. This effect comes exclusively from <b>inspections</b> that impose penalties, <b>inspections</b> {{which do not}} impose penalties appear to {{have no effect on}} injuries. Plants which are inspected (and penalized) in a given year experience a 22 percent decline in their injuries during the following few years. In our sample, total OSHA enforcement is predicted to have reduced injuries by about 2 percent. We take advantage of the panel nature of our data to test for a number of potential biases: autocorrelated injuries, plant-specific fixed-effects which are correlated with both <b>inspections</b> and injuries, and endogeneity of <b>inspections</b> (injuries causing <b>inspections).</b> These biases lead us to use the percentage change in injuries, rather than injury levels, as the dependent variable for our estimation. Our analysis shows that the estimated effect of <b>inspections</b> on the percentage change in injuries is not significantly affected by these biases, and thus seems to reflect a 'deterrence' effect of OSHA <b>inspections</b> on injuries. ...|$|R

However, the difference was not very large and some possible improvements were identified. Concerns with remote <b>inspections</b> of wind turbines that were not addressed by the experiment is discussed in the last part of this paper. These will be evaluated in upcoming field trials...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Despite {{considerable}} {{evidence to}} show that <b>inspections</b> can help reduce costs and improve quality, <b>inspections</b> are not widely deployed in the software industry. One of the likely reasons for this is the “not applicable here (NAH) ” syndrome- developers and managers believe that in their environment, <b>inspections</b> will not provide the benefits seen by other organizations. One of the big challenges for deploying <b>inspections</b> is to overcome this syndrome. In this report, we describe two experiments that can be conducted, with little effort, in an organization to obtain data from the organization to build a case for <b>inspections.</b> By conducting one of these experiments, we were able to effectively overcome the NAH syndrome in our organization-many developers and managers are now ready to try <b>inspections</b> in their projects. Though the purpose of the experiment was to overcome the syndrome, the data from the experiment also shows how code <b>inspections</b> compare with unit testing in terms of defect detection capability, and the effect of <b>inspections</b> on the overall cost of development...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects and}} {{side effects of}} school <b>inspections</b> have been {{investigated}} only to a limited degree. Studies in Great Britain, {{which is the only}} country to have a research tradition in this area, show that school <b>inspections</b> can lead to behavioral changes on the part of school leaders and teachers, as well as to school improvement. These studies do not offer satisfying explanations, however, for how school <b>inspections</b> generate these effects. The goal of this dissertation is therefore to expand the available knowledge concerning whether Dutch school <b>inspections</b> lead to school improvement. The research answers the following question: Is there evidence that school <b>inspections</b> have any effects and, if so, how do features of schools and school <b>inspections</b> contribute to these effects...|$|R

40|$|I {{examine how}} risk-based <b>inspections</b> {{influence}} auditor {{behavior in a}} multi-client setting. I conduct an experiment using an abstract setting that captures the theoretical constructs present in the audit ecology. I manipulate the presence of risk-based <b>inspections</b> between-participants {{and the level of}} client risk (higher vs. lower) within-participants. Consistent with the theoretical predictions, under conditions of high resource pressure, I find that auditor effort is higher under a regime with risk-based <b>inspections</b> as compared to a regime without <b>inspections,</b> and the auditor effort increases more for higher-risk clients than for lower-risk clients. More notably, following attentional control theory, I predict and find that risk-based <b>inspections</b> diminish the quality of auditor decision performance for lower-risk clients. Specifically, auditors' decision performance is worse (i. e., more suboptimal) for lower-risk clients than for higher-risk clients (ceteris paribus), but only under a risk-based <b>inspections</b> regime. Likewise, auditors' decision performance for lower-risk clients is worse in a regime with risk-based <b>inspections</b> than in a regime without <b>inspections.</b> I theorize that accountability pressures from PCAOB <b>inspections</b> combined with pressures from high resource constraints (that naturally occur in the audit environment) induce task-related anxiety on auditors. Following attentional control theory in a multi-task setting, I predict anxiety interrupts auditors' decision-making processing shifting attention toward higher-risk clients contributing to the anxiety, and away from lower-risk (untargeted) clients, thereby decreasing the quality of decision performance for lower-risk clients. I perform several supplemental analyses to test the underlying theory. First, I conduct a second experiment where auditors operate under relatively lower resource pressure and find that auditors’ decision performance is no longer worse for lower-risk clients in an <b>inspections</b> regime. The results support the theory that it is the combined pressures of <b>inspections</b> and high resource constraints causing the negative effects. Second, I conduct a supplemental experiment and measure participants' levels of anxiety. In support of the underlying theory, participants' reported anxiety levels are higher under a regime with versus without <b>inspections.</b> Third, I perform several robustness checks to rule out alternative explanations of the findings. The findings of this study contribute to the auditing literature, and they have practical and regulatory implications. First, by identifying higher auditor effort in a regime with <b>inspections,</b> I join others in documenting potential benefits of <b>inspections</b> on auditor behavior, and thus audit quality. Second, by examining the effect of risk-based <b>inspections</b> on auditor effort in a multi-task setting, I extend prior research by providing evidence that <b>inspections</b> increase auditor effort more for higher-risk clients than for lower-risk clients. Third, and most notably, by identifying diminished auditor decision performance for lower-risk clients under a risk-based <b>inspections</b> regime, this is the first study to provide theory and evidence on how risk-based <b>inspections</b> can lead to potential negative consequences on audit behavior, and thus audit quality.
