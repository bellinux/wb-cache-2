40|$|Background: Blood-sucking lice in the genera Pediculus and Pthirus are obligate ectoparasites {{of great}} apes. Unlike most {{bilateral}} animals, which have 37 mitochondrial (mt) genes {{on a single}} circular chromosome, the sucking <b>lice</b> of <b>humans</b> have extensively fragmented mt genomes. The head louse, Pediculus capitis, and the body louse, Pe. humanus, have their 37 mt genes on 20 minichromosomes. The pubic louse, Pthirus pubis, has its 34 mt genes known on 14 minichromosomes. To understand the process of mt genome fragmentation in the sucking lice of great apes, we sequenced the mt genome of the chimpanzee louse, Pe. schaeffi, and compared it with the three <b>human</b> <b>lice.</b> Results: We identified all of the 37 mt genes typical of bilateral animals in the chimpanzee louse; these genes are on 18 types of minichromosomes.

50|$|Humans are {{the only}} primate species that have {{undergone}} significant hair loss and of the approximately 5000 extant species of mammal, only a handful are effectively hairless. This list includes elephants, rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, walruses, some species of pigs, whales and other cetaceans, and naked mole rats. Most mammals have light skin that is covered by fur, and biologists believe that early human ancestors started out this way also. Dark skin probably evolved after humans lost their body fur, because the naked skin was vulnerable to the strong UV radiation as explained in the Out of Africa hypothesis. Therefore, evidence {{of the time when}} human skin darkened has been used to date the loss of human body hair, assuming that the dark skin was needed after the fur was gone.It was expected that dating the split of the ancestral <b>human</b> <b>louse</b> into two species, the head louse and the pubic louse, would date the loss of body hair in human ancestors. However, {{it turned out that the}} human pubic louse does not descend from the ancestral <b>human</b> <b>louse,</b> but from the gorilla louse, diverging 3.3 million years ago. This suggests that humans had lost body hair (but retained head hair) and developed thick pubic hair prior to this date, were living in or close to the forest where gorillas lived, and acquired pubic lice from butchering gorillas or sleeping in their nests.The evolution of the body louse from the head louse, on the other hand, places the date of clothing much later, some 100,000 years ago.|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{evolution}} of parasites is important to both basic and applied evolutionary biology. Knowledge of the genetic structure of parasite populations is critical for our ability to predict how an infection can spread through a host population and {{for the design of}} effective control methods. However, very {{little is known about the}} genetic structure of most human parasites, including the <b>human</b> <b>louse</b> (Pediculus humanus). This species is composed of two ecotypes: the head louse (Pediculus humanus capitis De Geer), and the clothing (body) louse (Pediculus humanus humanus Linnaeus). Hundreds of millions of head louse infestations affect children every year, and this number is on the rise, in part because of increased resistance to insecticides. Clothing lice affect mostly homeless and refugee-camp populations and although they are less prevalent than head lice, the medical consequences are more severe because they vector deadly bacterial pathogens. In this study we present the first assessment of the genetic structure of <b>human</b> <b>louse</b> populations by analyzing the nuclear genetic variation at 15 newly developed microsatellite loci in 93 human lice from 11 sites in four world regions. Both ecotypes showed heterozygote deficits relative to Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and high inbreeding values, an expected pattern given their parasitic life history. Bayesian clustering analyses assigned lice to four distinct genetic clusters that were geographically structured.

40|$|Bilateral {{animals are}} {{featured}} by an extremely compact mitochondrial (mt) genome {{that consists of}} a single circular chromosome. In the <b>human</b> body <b>louse</b> Pediculus humanus, however, the typical mt genome has fragmented into 20 minichromosomes. We sequenced the mt genomes of two other human lice: the head louse Pediculus capitis and the pubic louse Pthirus pubis. Comparison among the three <b>human</b> <b>lice</b> provided unprecedented insights into the evolution of fragmented mt genomes in bilateral animals. First, all three <b>human</b> <b>lice</b> have fragmented mt genomes, indicating this novel genome organization was present {{in the most recent}} common ancestor of the three <b>human</b> <b>lice,</b> which lived ~ 7 million years ago. Second, the head louse has exactly the same set of mt minichromosomes found in the body louse. Thus, the number of mt minichromosomes, and the gene content and gene arrangement on each minichromosome have remained unchanged since the body louse evolved from the head louse ~ 107, 000 years ago. Third, the pubic louse has the same pattern as the body louse and the head louse for the distribution of mt protein-coding and rRNA genes. This pattern, thus, has been stable for at least 7 million years. Most tRNA genes of the pubic louse, however, are on different minichromosomes when compared with their counterparts in the body and head louse. There is evidence that rearrangement of four tRNA genes (for leucine, arginine and glycine) was due to gene-identity switch by point mutation at third anti-codon positions, whereas rearrangement of 10 other tRNA genes was due to gene translocation between minichromosomes...|$|R

In addition, we assessed the effect of hyaluronidase coinoculation on the outcome of Leishmania major infection in BALB/c mice. Principal Findings: High hyaluronidase activity was detected in several Diptera tested, namely deer fly Chrysops viduatus, blackflies Odagmia ornata and Eusimilium latipes, mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, biting midge Culicoides kibunensis and sand fly Phlebotomus papatasi.

The endosymbiont represents a new bacterial lineage in the -Proteobacteria. Its closest sequenced relative is Arsenophonus nasoniae, from which it differs by more than 10 %. A. nasoniae is a male-killing endosymbiont of jewel wasps. Using microdissection and multiphoton confocal microscopy, we show the remarkable interaction of this bacterium with its host. This endosymbiont is unique because it occupies sequentially four different mycetomes during the development of its host, undergoes three cycles of proliferation, changes in length from 2 – 4 µm to more than 100 µm, and has two extracellular migrations, during one of which the endosymbionts have to outrun its host’s immune cells. The host and its symbiont have evolved {{one of the most}} complex interactions: two provisional or transitory mycetomes, a main mycetome and a paired filial mycetome.

40|$|AbstractRecent {{studies of}} {{molecular}} and genomic {{data from the}} parasitic lice of birds and mammals, {{as well as their}} mutualistic endosymbiotic bacteria, are changing the phylogenetic relationships and taxonomy of these organisms. Phylogenetic studies of lice suggest that vertebrate parasitism arose multiple times from free-living book and bark lice. Molecular clocks show that the major families of lice arose in the late Mesozoic and radiated in the early Cenozoic, following the radiation of mammals and birds. The recent release of the <b>human</b> <b>louse</b> genome has provided new opportunities for research. The genome is being used to find new genetic markers for phylogenetics and population genetics, to understand the complex evolutionary relationships of mitochondrial genes, and to study genome evolution. Genomes are informing us not only about lice, but also about their obligate endosymbiotic bacteria. In contrast to lice and their hosts, lice and their endosymbionts do not share common evolutionary histories, suggesting that endosymbionts are either replaced over time or that there are multiple independent origins of symbiosis in lice. Molecular phylogenetics and whole genome sequencing have recently provided the first insights into the phylogenetic placement and metabolic characteristics of these distantly related bacteria. Comparative genomics between distantly related louse symbionts can provide insights into conserved metabolic functions and can help to explain how distantly related species are fulfilling their role as mutualistic symbionts. In lice and their endosymbionts, molecular data and genome sequencing are driving our understanding of evolutionary relationships and classification, and will for the foreseeable future...|$|E

(Phthiraptera, Pediculidae) up to 72 h after feeding on a surrogate rabbit host (Oryctolagus cuniculus L.) (Lagomorpha, Leporidae). Two rabbit-specific primer pairs were developed to produce amplicons of 199 bp and 283 bp, the smaller of which was found to have a significantly slower decay rate. Median detection periods (T 50) for the amplicons were 20 h and 12 h, with maximum detection periods of 24 h and 12 h, respectively, suggesting an inversely proportional linear relationship between amplicon size and digestion time. The data provide an indication of timeframes essential for the design of forensic sampling protocols and a basis for investigating the feeding frequency of <b>human</b> <b>lice...</b>|$|R
