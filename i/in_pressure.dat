5|$|Decompression in {{the context}} of diving derives from the {{reduction}} in ambient pressure experienced by the diver during the ascent {{at the end of a}} dive or hyperbaric exposure and refers to both the reduction <b>in</b> <b>pressure</b> and the process of allowing dissolved inert gases to be eliminated from the tissues during this reduction <b>in</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
5|$|Even {{when the}} change <b>in</b> <b>pressure</b> causes no {{immediate}} symptoms, rapid pressure change can cause permanent bone injury called dysbaric osteonecrosis (DON). DON can develop {{from a single}} exposure to rapid decompression.|$|E
5|$|Barotrauma, {{an example}} of dysbarism, is {{physical}} damage to body tissues caused by a difference <b>in</b> <b>pressure</b> between a gas space inside, or {{in contact with the}} body, and the surrounding gas or fluid. It typically occurs when the organism is exposed to a large change in ambient pressure, such as when a diver ascends or descends. When diving, the pressure differences which cause the barotrauma are changes in hydrostatic pressure.|$|E

5|$|Charging {{an empty}} dive {{cylinder}} also causes a temperature rise as the gas inside the cylinder is compressed by the inflow of higher pressure gas, though this temperature rise may initially be tempered because compressed gas from a storage bank {{at room temperature}} decreases in temperature when it decreases <b>in</b> <b>pressure,</b> so at first the empty cylinder is charged with cold gas, but {{the temperature of the}} gas in the cylinder then increases to above ambient as the cylinder fills to the working pressure.|$|E

5|$|Measurements of {{barometric}} {{pressure and the}} pressure tendency (the change of pressure over time) {{have been used in}} forecasting since the late 19th century. The larger the change <b>in</b> <b>pressure,</b> especially if more than , the larger the change in weather can be expected. If the pressure drop is rapid, a low pressure system is approaching, and there is a greater chance of rain. Rapid pressure rises are associated with improving weather conditions, such as clearing skies.|$|E

5|$|Once microbubbles have formed, {{they can}} grow by either a {{reduction}} <b>in</b> <b>pressure</b> or by {{diffusion of gas}} into the gas from its surroundings. In the body, bubbles may be located within tissues or carried along with the bloodstream. The speed of blood flow within a blood vessel {{and the rate of}} delivery of blood to capillaries (perfusion) are the main factors that determine whether dissolved gas is taken up by tissue bubbles or circulation bubbles for bubble growth.|$|E
5|$|Radiotherapy is {{used when}} drug {{treatment}} is failing {{to control the}} pain of a growing tumor, such as in bone metastisis (most commonly), penetration of soft tissue, or compression of sensory nerves. Often, low doses are adequate to produce analgesia, thought {{to be due to}} reduction <b>in</b> <b>pressure</b> or, possibly, interference with the tumor's production of pain-promoting chemicals. Radiopharmaceuticals that target specific tumors have been used to treat the pain of metastatic illnesses. Relief may occur within a week of treatment and may last from two to four months.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the center}} of Gustav {{remained}} well offshore, the difference <b>in</b> <b>pressure</b> between it and a high pressure area over the central United States caused strong winds in areas of New Jersey on September 11. Wind gusts ranged from 35–45mph (55–70km/h), with stronger winds reported near the coast. A maximum wind gust of 60mph (100km/h) was reported at Keansburg. The strong winds downed trees and power lines throughout {{the eastern half of}} the state, damaging homes and blocking streets. At least 14,000 homes in the vicinity of Burlington and Ocean Counties were left without power. In West Windsor Township, a man was killed when the upper section of a concrete wall he was working on blew over and crushed him. The other death occurred in West Amwell Township, where a tree limb fell on two elderly women, killing one and injuring the other. Elsewhere, while there were reports of trees falling on vehicles, no other serious injuries or deaths were reported.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{nearly half}} the {{hydrogen}} at the core has been consumed, with {{the remainder of the}} atoms consisting primarily of helium. As the number of hydrogen atoms per unit mass decreases, so too does their energy output provided through nuclear fusion. This results in a decrease <b>in</b> <b>pressure</b> support, which causes the core to contract until the increased density and temperature bring the core pressure into equilibrium with the layers above. The higher temperature causes the remaining hydrogen to undergo fusion at a more rapid rate, thereby generating the energy needed to maintain the equilibrium.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the cardiac cycle, in early diastole, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed. Since blood moves from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, when the chambers are relaxed, blood will flow into the atria (through the coronary sinus and the pulmonary veins). As the atria begin to fill, the pressure will rise so that the blood will move from the atria into the ventricles. In late diastole the atria contract, pumping more blood into the ventricles. This causes a rise <b>in</b> <b>pressure</b> in the ventricles. As the ventricles reach systole, blood will be pumped into the pulmonary artery (right ventricle) or aorta (left ventricle).|$|E
5|$|CSF is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in two steps. Firstly, a filtered form of plasma moves from fenestrated capillaries in the choroid plexus into an interstitial space, with movement guided by a difference <b>in</b> <b>pressure</b> between the blood in the capillaries and the interstitial fluid. This fluid then needs {{to pass through the}} epithelium cells lining the choroid plexus into the ventricles, an active process requiring the transport of sodium, potassium and chloride that draws water into the CSF by creating osmotic pressure. Unlike blood passing from the capillaries into the choroid plexus, the epithelial cells lining the choroid plexus contain tight junctions between cells, which act to prevent most substances flowing freely into the CSF.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} {{should be}} suspected {{if any of}} the symptoms associated with the condition occurs following a drop <b>in</b> <b>pressure,</b> in particular, within 24 hours of diving. In 1995, 95% of all cases reported to Divers Alert Network had shown symptoms within 24 hours. An alternative diagnosis should be suspected if severe symptoms begin more than six hours following decompression without an altitude exposure or if any symptom occurs more than 24 hours after surfacing. The diagnosis is confirmed if the symptoms are relieved by recompression. Although MRI or CT can frequently identify bubbles in DCS, they are not as good at determining the diagnosis as a proper history of the event and description of the symptoms.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{demonstrate}} the application feasibility of the reactor composed of a forced constricted type DC plasma jet generator and a feed ring to low pressure plasma processing, we have studied the production of ultrafine particles of refractory materials (Al_ 2 O_ 3, ZrC, TiC) and {{the interaction between the}} plasma flow and the injected particles. According to the experimental results, many ultrafine particles whose diameters are less than 0. 1 μm are prepared not only <b>in</b> atmospheric <b>pressure</b> but also <b>in</b> low <b>pressure,</b> although the number density of the prepared ultrafine particles, N, <b>in</b> low <b>pressure</b> is usually less than that <b>in</b> atmospheric <b>pressure.</b> It is also found that we can control the process of particle heating by changing the feed ring length, and that N <b>in</b> low <b>pressure</b> becomes equal to or greater than N <b>in</b> atmospheric <b>pressure</b> with increasing the feed ring length...|$|R

Due to the similarity <b>in</b> <b>pressure</b> and temperature and the fact that breathable air (21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen) is a lifting gas on Venus in the same way that helium is a lifting gas on Earth, the upper atmosphere has been proposed as a location for both exploration and colonization.|$|E

5|$|Helium {{is used as}} a {{component}} of breathing gases to replace nitrogen, due its low solubility in fluids, especially in lipids. Gases are absorbed by the blood and body tissues when under pressure like in scuba diving, which causes an anesthetic effect known as nitrogen narcosis. Due to its reduced solubility, little helium is taken into cell membranes, and when helium is used to replace part of the breathing mixtures, such as in trimix or heliox, a decrease in the narcotic effect of the gas at depth is obtained. Helium's reduced solubility offers further advantages for the condition known as decompression sickness, or the bends. The reduced amount of dissolved gas in the body means that fewer gas bubbles form during the decrease <b>in</b> <b>pressure</b> of the ascent. Another noble gas, argon, is considered the best option for use as a drysuit inflation gas for scuba diving. Helium is also used as filling gas in nuclear fuel rods for nuclear reactors.|$|E
