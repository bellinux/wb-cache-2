For it is in this sense that Aristotle calls metaphysics ‘theology’ and ‘the divine science’. Accordingly, metaphysics differs from theology in the fact that although each considers God and those things that pertain to divinity, metaphysics only considers them as regards what can be proved and implied, or inductively inferred, by demonstrative reason.” ...|$|E

40|$|Initial {{analysis}} of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 (the 2008 Act), amending the 1990 Act of the same name, points towards {{the central role of}} consent provisions in both the construction of legal parenthood and in relation to gaining access to further information about one’s genetic origins. This approach arguably lends support to the thematicunification of these disparate issues. However, upon closer examination, the complexities of these new provisions and the relevant Parliamentary debates point towards gendered dimensions at play, which are downplayed by the gender-neutrality of the statute and rights discourse in general. The focus of this chapter, therefore, is the examination of key issues pertaining to the interest(s) in knowing one’s genetic origins, in the wider sense provided for by the 2008 Act. I use the term ‘interest’ here as my intention is not to add to the burgeoning literature debating donor-conceived children/persons’ purported ‘right’ to <b>know</b> <b>per</b> <b>se,</b> but rather to consider why identity, and in particular genetic information, is highlighted in this context; and also to consider what interests and crucially whose are promoted and protected by the legislative provisions. The fixation with the need for ‘truth’ around paternal ties rather than with maternal connections remains. Interestingly however, there is an identifiable inversion of the trend to protect a ‘recipient family’ (of donor gametes) from incursions by their donor(s) to that of shielding the donor’s family (read ‘legal’ family) from interference by donor offspring, and by extension their family members. Furthermore, the grounds upon which this protection is justified – at least in the relevant Parliamentary debates – is largely gender specific. Therefore, while significant aspects of the 2008 Act are couched in gender-neutral terms, {{it is clear that the}} impetus for these changes occurred within highly gendered contexts...|$|R

This is known as the three-factor Penn Central test (after Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City where it was articulated). The Penn Central decision has been severely criticized by commentators on both sides of the [...] "taking issue" [...] controversy, because its [...] "three-factor" [...] approach is so vague that it enables judges to reach whatever result they prefer. It also makes it extremely difficult for lawyers to tell in advance of filing a lawsuit what facts will be deemed decisive by the court, and how to apply them.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} effects of aging on {{arterial}} thrombus formation by comparing 2 -year-old with 11 -week-old C 57 Bl 6 mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Aging is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In humans, assessing the direct effects of aging on vascular homeostasis is difficult because it occurs {{in the presence of}} other risk factors. Arterial thrombosis is the critical event in cardiovascular diseases; however, it is not <b>known</b> whether aging <b>per</b> <b>se</b> promotes its occurrence. Mice represent an interesting system to address this issue because they age without spontaneously developing other risk factors. Organ chamber experiments confirmed the advanced level of aging of old mice. As previously shown, old mice exhibited endothelial dysfunction; however, arterial thrombosis induced by photochemical injury was unchanged. Arterial tissue factor expression and activity; expressions of tissue factor pathway inhibitor, thrombomodulin, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; prothrombin time; partial thromboplastin time; thrombin-antithrombin complex; and platelet activation were comparable in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although these results cannot be directly extrapolated to humans, this study contributes novel important information on the direct effect of aging on arterial thrombosis and underscores the importance of controlling modifiable risk factors in aged individuals...|$|R

40|$|Preemption {{has emerged}} as the leading {{contender}} for conceptual grounding of the patentable subject matter doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s exclusion of abstract ideas and natural phenomena from patentability. Despite the Supreme Courts frequent use of preemption rhetoric, however, the concept cannot provide a satisfactory explanation of the Courts patentable subject matter jurisprudence or a sound theoretical basis for the doctrine. Patentable subject matter jurisprudence has two distinct threads, one concerned with overly broad impact on downstream innovation and the other based on <b>per</b> <b>se</b> exclusion of abstract ideas and natural phenomena from patentability. Most of the Courts patentable subject matter decisions apply a <b>per</b> <b>se</b> exclusion analysis. While preemption is conceptually related to the downstream impact thread, the term is misleading even in that context. When preemption rhetoric is employed in the majority of cases, which are based on <b>per</b> <b>se</b> exclusion, it leads to confusion and incoherence. This Article disentangles the preemption rhetoric from the <b>per</b> <b>se</b> exclusion analysis in the Supreme Courts cases. <b>Per</b> <b>se</b> exclusion analysis necessarily involves two steps: identifying the <b>per</b> <b>se</b> excluded elements in a claim and applying some rule to determine whether additional claim limitations render the claim patentable. The Article identifies these two steps within the Supreme Courts cases and seeks to prepare the ground for coherent theoretical analysis. Preemption rhetoric is a distraction from important questions that must be answered to give patentable subject matter doctrine a firm theoretical grounding. First, what are the normative bases of the <b>per</b> <b>se</b> exclusions? As the discussion of the cases shows, failing to answer this question leads to seemingly arbitrary (or result-driven) identification of the <b>per</b> <b>se</b> excluded elements in a claim. Second, what rules should be used to determine whether a particular claim incorporating <b>per</b> <b>se</b> excluded elements along with other limitations is patentable subject matter? The current muddle in patentable subject matter analysis is due largely to failure to moor these second-step rules to the normative basis for <b>per</b> <b>se</b> exclusion...|$|R

40|$|North Carolina’s “unfair or {{deceptive}} acts or practices” statute, section 75 - 1. 1 of the North Carolina General Statutes, is {{a central}} feature of North Carolina litigation. The statute allows lucrative remedies, but it defines prohibited conduct with only vague standards. Courts have difficulty applying these standards in any detail, so they often use analytical shortcuts in decisions under the statute. One key shortcut under section 75 - 1. 1 is the “per se violation. ” A <b>per</b> <b>se</b> violation arises when actions that violate a source of law outside section 75 - 1. 1 —a different statute, a regulation, or a nonstatutory doctrine—automatically violate section 75 - 1. 1 as well. A <b>per</b> <b>se</b> violation has a transformative effect: in one stroke, it turns a claim for single damages into a claim for treble damages and possible attorney fees. Courts in section 75 - 1. 1 cases have struggled to decide when to carry out, and when to refuse, this transformation. They have accepted and rejected <b>per</b> <b>se</b> theories with no explanation or with question-begging explanations. They have also sidestepped the problems with a <b>per</b> <b>se</b> theory by applying a number of variations on <b>per</b> <b>se</b> theories. This variety of approaches leaves courts and lawyers to guess at what analysis to apply in future cases. The courts can end this confusion by sharpening the <b>per</b> <b>se</b> theory and replacing parts of it. In many instances, the General Assembly has announced, directly or indirectly, that a violation of a given statute is also a violation of section 75 - 1. 1. Courts should continue to apply these <b>per</b> <b>se</b> violations. In all other cases, however, courts should ask whether the conduct that makes up a separate violation satisfies the tests for unfairness under section 75 - 1. 1. The tests for unfairness already address violations of separate statutes and other expressions of public policy. This streamlined approach will strengthen the analysis of <b>per</b> <b>se</b> and non-per-se violations alike...|$|R
