40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{ascertain}} whether myocardial scarring occurs in living unselected patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). BackgroundMyocardial scarring is known to occur in select HCM patients, who were highly symptomatic prior to death or who died suddenly. The majority of HCM patients, however, are minimally symptomatic and have not suffered sudden death. MethodsCine and gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 21 HCM patients who were predominantly asymptomatic. Gadolinium hyperenhancement was assumed to represent myocardial scar, {{and the extent of}} scar was compared to left ventricular (LV) morphology and function. ResultsScarring was present in 17 patients (81 %). Scarring occurred only in <b>hypertrophied</b> <b>regions</b> (≥ 10 mm), was patchy with multiple foci, and predominantly involved the middle third of the ventricular wall. All 17 patients had scarring at the junction of the interventricular septum and the right ventricular (RV) free wall. On a regional basis, the extent of scarring correlated positively with wall thickness (r = 0. 36, p < 0. 0001), and inversely with wall thickening (r = − 0. 21, p < 0. 0001). On a per patient basis, the extent of scarring (mean, 8 ± 9 % of LV mass) was minimally related to maximum wall thickness (r = 0. 40, p = 0. 07) and LV mass (r = 0. 33, p = 0. 15), and correlated inversely with ejection fraction (r = − 0. 46, p = 0. 04). ConclusionsMyocardial scarring is common in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic HCM patients who have not suffered sudden death. When present, scarring occurs in <b>hypertrophied</b> <b>regions,</b> is consistently localized to the junctions of the septum and RV free wall, and correlates positively with regional hypertrophy and inversely with regional contraction...|$|E
40|$|Histological {{changes in}} roots of Beta vulgaris {{cultivar}} 'USH 9 A' resulting from infection of Meloidogyne hapla alone, Heterodera schachtii alone, or infection by both species on one feeding site were studied. Anatomical changes caused by M. hapla infection {{were characterized by}} <b>regions</b> of <b>hypertrophy</b> and hyperplasia. Giant cells were formed within the stele and varied in numbers from 4 - 7 /feeding site; hyperplasia occurred {{in the form of}} a large number of relatively small compacted cells generally surrounding the <b>hypertrophied</b> <b>region.</b> H. schachtii-induced syncytia became dense and muhinucleate. Syncytia were formed in the stele and were limited on the side toward the nematode by endodermis or in part by cortical tissue. Histological changes due to the presence of both parasites on one feeding site were characterized by formation of two distinctive pathological tissues typical of both nematodes. In most infections, xylem elements separated the two pathological tissues. In some sections, a single wall separated the two pathological tissues, and no dissolution of separating wall was noted in any sections. Each nematode developed normally and produced its own characteristic pathological tissue independently...|$|R
40|$|Patients who {{underwent}} surgical resection of an advanced colorectal cancer {{during the period}} from June 1982 to July 2001 were examined for evidence of no anastomotic recurrence or recurrent lesions through combination of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) with endoscopy. Included in this study were 11 patients with recurrence and 36 patients without recurrence, 47 patients in all. Endoscopy revealed stenosis in 81. 8 % of patients with ana anastomotic recurrence, erosion including cancer exposure in 81. 8 % and submucosal tumor-like elevation in 45. 5 %. In the group of patients without recurrence it revealed stenosis in 13. 9 % of patients, erosion in 22. 2 %, and a scar-like change in 77. 8 %. There was {{a significant difference between the}} two groups in each change. EUS, on the other hand, revealed localized <b>hypertrophy</b> of the <b>region</b> extending from the submucosa to the mp due to edema early in the postoperative course. The rate of definitive diagnosis with EUS was 100 %, compared to 90. 1 % for endoscopy. The results of this study indicate that EUS is helpful in detecting anastomotic recurrence of colorectal cancer...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThis study {{assessed}} {{left ventricular}} myocardial perfusion and sympathetic innervation and function in hypertrophied and nonhypertrophied myocardial regions {{of patients with}} hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). BACKGROUNDPatients with HCM often have clinical findings consistent with increased cardiac sympathetic outflow. Little {{is known about the}} status of sympathetic innervation specifically in hypertrophic regions. METHODSWe conducted positron emission tomographic (PET) scanning using the perfusion imaging agent 13 N-ammonia (13 NH 3) and the sympathoneuronal imaging agent 6 -[18 F]-fluorodopamine (18 F-FDA) in 8 patients with HCM and 15 normal volunteers. Positron emission tomographic data corrected for attenuation and the partial volume effect were analyzed using the region-of-interest technique. RESULTSMyocardial 13 NH 3 -derived radioactivity was similar in <b>hypertrophied</b> and nonhypertrophied <b>regions</b> of patients with HCM and in normal volunteers. At all time points, the 18 F: 13 N ratio was lower in hypertrophied than in nonhypertrophied regions of HCM patients and in the septum of normal volunteers (p = 0. 001). Trends in 18 F-FDA-derived radioactivity over time were normal in both hypertrophied and nonhypertrophied myocardium. CONCLUSIONSThe results are consistent with decreased neuronal uptake of catecholamines in hypertrophied but not in nonhypertrophied myocardium of patients with HCM. Other aspects of cardiac sympathoneural function seem normal. Decreased neuronal uptake could reflect local relative hypoinnervation, decreased numbers of neuronal uptake sites, or metabolic limitations on cell membrane transport. By enhancing norepinephrine delivery to adrenoceptors for a given amount of sympathetic nerve traffic, decreased neuronal uptake can explain major clinical features of HCM...|$|R
40|$|After a yeast two-hybrid screen {{identified}} prosaposin as {{a potential}} interacting protein with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit alpha 10, studies were performed to characterize prosaposin in the normal rodent inner ear. Prosaposin demonstrates diffuse organ of Corti expression at birth, with gradual localization to the inner hair cells (IHCs) and its supporting cells, inner pillar cells, and synaptic region of the outer hair cells (OHCs) and Deiters' cells (DCs) by postnatal day 21 (P 21). Microdissected OHC and DC quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR and immunohistology localizes prosaposin mRNA to DCs and OHCs, and protein predominantly to {{the apex of the}} DCs. Subsequent studies in a prosaposin knock-out (KO) (-/-) mouse showed intact but slightly reduced hearing through P 19, but deafness by P 25 and reduced distortion product otoacoustic emissions from P 15 onward. Beginning at P 12, the prosaposin KO mice showed histologic organ of Corti changes including cellular <b>hypertrophy</b> in the <b>region</b> of the IHC and greater epithelial ridge, a loss of OHCs from cochlear apex, and vacuolization of OHCs. Immunofluorescence revealed exuberant overgrowth of auditory afferent neurites in the region of the IHCs and proliferation of auditory efferent neurites in the region of the tunnel of Corti. IHC recordings from these KO mice showed normal I-V curves and responses to applied acetylcholine. Together, these results suggest that prosaposin helps maintain normal innervation patterns to the organ of Corti. Furthermore, prosaposin's overlapping developmental expression pattern and binding capacity toward the nAChR alpha 10 suggest that alpha 10 may also play a role in this function...|$|R
30|$|Our study {{investigated}} cortical thickness in young adult patients with schizophrenia and relatively homogenous clinical subgroups of bipolar I disorder patients, comprising of psychotic—(PBD) and non-psychotic (NPBD) patients with hyperthymic mania histories. We found that SCZ participants had significant cortical thinning relative to CON and BD most {{significantly in the}} frontal (i.e. paracentral), parietal (i.e. inferior parietal, supramarginal), and temporal (i.e. middle temporal, fusiform) cortices. Our {{results are consistent with}} that of most other studies which found cortical thinning in SCZ relative to control populations across a wide range of cortical regions, usually including parts of the frontal and temporal cortex (van Erp et al. 2017; Rimol et al. 2012; Sugihara et al. 2017; Knochel et al. 2016; Besteher et al. 2016; Nenadic et al. 2015; Goldman et al. 2009). A recent meta-analysis of 4474 SCZ subjects found that the largest effect sizes for lower cortical thickness compared to controls were present in the fusiform, inferior frontal (pars opercularis), lateral orbitofrontal, temporal (inferior/medial/superior), parahippocampal, insula, isthmus cingulate, and the posterior cingulate cortices (van Erp et al. 2017). Despite some inconsistencies in the specific affected regions across schizophrenia studies, which likely reflects the biological heterogeneity of patients and methodological differences, cortical thinning is considered a key pathology underlying schizophrenia. Interestingly, we also found increased cortical thickness in an isolated region—the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)—in the schizophrenia group, as well as in both groups of bipolar disorder subjects. The ACC is a brain region critical for integrating cognitive and emotional functions in support of adaptive, goal-directed behavior (Devinsky et al. 1995). Increased ACC thickness in our subjects {{do not appear to be}} driven primarily by their relatively young age, as ACC thinning has also been seen in youth at clinically high risk for developing schizophrenia (Jung et al. 2011; Yucel et al. 2003). These findings in our patient groups differ from other studies that found gray matter reduction in the ACC in schizophrenia (Fornito et al. 2009 a; Bouras et al. 2001; Hanford et al. 2016). However, increased ACC thickness has been reported in male first episode psychosis in bipolar disorder (Fornito et al. 2009 b). These authors suggested that <b>hypertrophy</b> of <b>regions</b> critical for regulating the HPA axis, including the ACC, amygdala and pituitary gland, in early psychosis may be associated with an elevated stress response, which ultimately results in volumetric contraction with chronic illness. A few other authors also found increased ACC thickness in either first-episode (Adler et al. 2007) or chronic (Adler et al. 2005; Bearden et al. 2007) bipolar disorder, which was also been attributable to lithium effects in one study (Bearden et al. 2007) but not others (Fornito et al. 2009; Adler et al. 2007). Taken together, these findings suggest that while widespread cortical thinning is pathognomonic of schizophrenia, increased ACC thickness in some schizophrenia cohorts may reflect a hyperfunctional abnormality that produces an excessive stress response.|$|R
