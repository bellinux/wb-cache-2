2500|$|Now <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> shout! [...] "Where is she? Where is she? Where is she? I don't want to ram her!" [...] Everyone {{was out on}} {{the wing}} of the bridge except me and no one other than myself was talking.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> stare dumbly before I {{could manage}} to ask: “For Tolosa?” {{in a very}} knowing tone.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> be surprised. If the Baron took a like {{cognizance}} {{of all my}} countrymen {{who came}} to New Orleans, he was a busy man indeed.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn,</b> now, to {{enlighten}} Ezra Jennings. I stopped him, {{before he could}} say any more.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> now to hold HER. She {{tried to}} break away from me and get down first to the door.|$|R
6000|$|I lit. I drifted up to a gate with a {{swarm of}} people, and when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> the head clerk says, in a business-like way-- ...|$|R
60|$|Now <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> {{be unable}} to speak and to feel my eyes fill with tears, tears of rage, for {{remember}} that I was still very feeble. But Marie spoke for me.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> {{come to a}} {{standstill}} now. I tried vainly, in the gathering darkness, to see his face. In the surprise of the moment, I asked a little impatiently what he meant.|$|E
60|$|Now <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> be tempted, but I, too, overcame, and, sitting down, laid Higgs's head upon my knee; then, drop by drop, let {{a little}} of the water trickle between his swollen lips.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now,' {{said the}} still undaunted Violet, when the torrent of unsparing jest had {{expended}} itself, 'now <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn.</b> Let {{me show you}} one short piece. This--"To L."' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> now {{to shake}} a doleful head. [...] "There are no extra instruments," [...] I told them. [...] "They too have {{disappeared}} {{as did the}} wireless apparatus." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Sir Sagramore said: [...] "Well, Sir Knight, {{that was}} certes {{a very great}} buffet that you gave my fellow, but now <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to have ado with you." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> shiver and become pale, as any may guess {{who may have}} chanced to read the history of Mameena, and the turn of Miss Holmes to watch me with {{animated}} interest.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> flush, but I did not. I {{felt that}} she was poking fun at me, and I admired a brave heart that could look for humour on the road to death, and so I laughed with her.|$|E
6000|$|The reply fretted me. I wanted bare facts just then. [...] "Why {{are you so}} angry? What is your name? And {{where do}} you live?" [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> ask questions, and I popped them out {{as if from a}} Little by Little.|$|E
6000|$|The Baroness met his eyes; she colored just a little. Then she rose. [...] "I {{should have}} the {{satisfaction}} of saying, 'Now <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn.</b> I break with your serene highness!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn,</b> old lady," [...] ejaculated Higgs, and {{straightway}} {{missed her}} clean {{from a distance}} of five yards. A second shot was more successful, and she rolled over, dead.|$|R
6000|$|... "Comrades, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> {{to throw}} in this great game. I have heard and {{considered}} all, and I think it best that I should be surrendered, with the Augusta, to the Greeks." ...|$|R
60|$|Now <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> smile. He {{was very}} cunning, {{but it was}} evidently this that he was aiming at. He had some reason to conceal {{the fact that he}} had run away with a woman, and he was using every {{precaution}} to hide her whereabouts. I answered with decision.|$|E
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> {{face him}} squarely. I did so and {{mentioned}} the amount I could dispose of. And I perceived {{that he was}} disappointed. He thought it over, his calculating gaze lost in mine, {{for quite a long}} time before he came out in a thoughtful tone with the rapacious suggestion: ...|$|E
60|$|My friends’ launch cast us loose {{just below}} the grotto, and then Harris wanted to make out that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> pull. This seemed to me most unreasonable. It had been {{arranged}} in the morning that I should bring the boat up to three miles above Reading. Well, here we were, ten miles above Reading! Surely it was now their turn again.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> then," [...] {{says the}} Colonel, {{with a glance}} of kindness. The anger has {{disappeared}} from under his brows; {{at that moment the}} menaced battle is postponed.|$|R
6000|$|Eva {{looked up}} with some anxiety in her frank eyes as she said, [...] "Now <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn.</b> Must I give up my dear homely books, and take to Ruskin, Kant, or Plato?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hah," [...] quoth Sir Ector, [...] "that {{was a very}} {{wonderful}} buffet you struck my fellow. But now <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to have ado with you, and I hope God {{will send}} me a better fortune." ...|$|R
60|$|The whisky came--and five persons partook. It was fiery, oily {{stuff from}} heaven knows where. The bounder rattled away, {{spouting}} his bits of English and his four words of German. He {{was in high}} feather, wriggling his large haunches on his chair and waving his hands. He had a peculiar manner of wriggling {{from the bottom of}} his back, with fussy self-assertiveness. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> offer whisky.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> {{stand at}} the foremast-head; and with my {{shoulders}} leaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed in what seemed an enchanted air. No resolution could withstand it; in that dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last my soul went out of my body; though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will, long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{used to be}} {{so frightened}} when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> sit in the chair with the crown on, and see you all come marching round to give the presents, with a kiss. I liked the things and the kisses, but it was dreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened the bundles," [...] said Beth, who was {{toasting}} her face and the bread for tea at the same time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> {{to dictate}} terms, Alan. You {{know what they}} are. The thing is quite simple. Come, don't work {{yourself}} into this fever. The thing has to <b>be</b> done. Face <b>it,</b> and do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{that would}} be the best plan," [...] Harry agreed. [...] "Now I will go back and take Bertie's place. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to <b>be</b> on watch, and he will be wanting to hear the news." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> now to stop suddenly. In {{the excited}} state of my curiosity, at that moment, the chance {{reference}} to Mr. Fairlie's place of residence, {{on the lips}} of my strange companion, staggered me with astonishment.|$|R
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> be {{surprised}} now. I said: [...] "I can't help it. I {{give you my}} word of honor that it is as I say. I saw you at the reception, and you were dressed precisely as you are now. When they told me {{a moment ago that}} I should find a friend in this room, your image rose before me, dress and all, just as I had seen you at the reception." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> knit my brows. [...] "Was I indeed?" [...] quoth I. [...] "Why, yes, it {{may well}} be. But what of that? Is the hour in which I quitted Pesaro a matter of such moment as to be worth lying over? If I said that I left about the first hour, it is because I was under the {{impression}} that it was so. But I was so distraught by grief at Madonna's death that I may have been careless in my account of time." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> be cheerful, and I {{played the}} {{part to the}} best of my ability, and with such success that I brought the {{laughter}} back into her dear eyes and song on her lips; for she sang to me before she went to an early bed. It was the first time I had heard her sing, and I lay by the fire, listening and transported, for she was nothing if not an artist in everything she did, and her voice, though not strong, was wonderfully sweet and expressive.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Staveley {{declined}} {{to tell me}} whether she had offered a bright example of gratitude {{to the rest of}} the sex. When I asked why, she declared that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> now to tell her what I had been doing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, son, {{wait till}} I have finished. Almighty! {{for the last}} twenty minutes you have been sitting as silent as an ant-bear in a hole, and I tell you that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> now; why, then, do you {{interrupt}} me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You told me {{we should}} see each other no more, and you have come back. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> now to go, and to go forever. I say that we shall see each other no more, and my word shall not be broken." ...|$|R
