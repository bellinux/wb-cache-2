500|$|Douglas Hurd, once Home's private secretary, {{and many}} years later his {{successor}} (after seven intermediate holders of the post) as Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, wrote this personal comment: [...] "The three most courteous men <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>in</b> politics were Lord Home, King Hussein of Jordan, and President Nelson Mandela. All three had ease of birth, {{in the sense that}} they never needed to worry about who they themselves were and so had more time to concern themselves with the feelings of others." ...|$|E
500|$|Obama raised {{enough money}} to remain {{competitive}} with Rush. However, he neither connected with the working-class African Americans of the district nor provided a convincing reason for them to vote against Rush. Obama later wrote: [...] "Less than halfway into the campaign, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>in</b> my bones that I was going to lose. Each morning from that point forward I awoke with a vague sense of dread, realizing that I {{would have to spend}} the day smiling and shaking hands and pretending that everything was going according to plan." ...|$|E

6000|$|The cloister, {{to which}} this door gives entrance, is exactly [...] {{contemporary}} with the finest work of the Ducal Palace, circa 1350.

500|$|Jackman also {{watched a}} woman undergo brain tumor surgery and was shaken {{to see the}} woman have similar blond hair to his wife: [...] "All I {{could think of was}} my wife on that table. As much as I'd read the script and theorized and practiced philosophy, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>in</b> that moment that I was so not ready for death." [...] For his various characters, the actor assumed a {{different}} posture for each persona. As the conquistador, Jackman was upright and forward-leaning to evoke an unstoppable nature. As the scientist, the actor hunched over with a dedicated focus on his character's work, being weighed down by the [...] "world on his shoulders." [...] As the space traveler, Jackman practiced the state of zen but also exhibited a continued persistence in his endeavor.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} {{encourage}} the captains of the merchant ships of all countries which carry the lifeblood of the U.K., I {{made it a point}} to attend the briefing conference of all captains and chief engineers before their departure. During the winter of '42–'43, when sinkings were at their worst, I could see when I told them of the measures by escort and air cover that were being taken for their protection and safety; I could see that they knew very well and that they knew <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>in</b> spite of my brave words, that anything up to 25 per cent of them would probably not arrive in the U.K. in their own ships, and that probably half of that number would not arrive in the U.K. at all. But there was never a waver in their resolve – Admiral Murray.|$|E
500|$|Production advisor Miriam Geiger quickly {{compiled}} a handmade film textbook for Welles, a practical reference book of film techniques that he studied carefully. He then taught himself filmmaking by matching its visual vocabulary to The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, which he ordered from the Museum of Modern Art, and films by Frank Capra, René Clair, Fritz Lang, King Vidor and Jean Renoir. The one film he genuinely studied was John Ford's Stagecoach, which he watched 40 times. [...] "As it turned out, {{the first day}} I ever walked onto a set was my first day as a director," [...] Welles said. [...] "I'd learned whatever <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>in</b> the projection room—from Ford. After dinner every night for about a month, I'd run Stagecoach, often with some different technician or department head from the studio, and ask questions. 'How was this done?' 'Why was this done?' It was like going to school." ...|$|E

Later that same year, Kolmogorov began to study at the Moscow State University and at the same time Mendeleev Moscow Institute of Chemistry and Technology. Kolmogorov writes about this time: [...] "I arrived at Moscow University with a fair knowledge of mathematics. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>in</b> particular the beginning of set theory. I studied many questions in articles in the Encyclopedia of Brockhaus and Efron, filling out for myself what was presented too concisely in these articles." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1946, Callas {{was engaged}} to re-open the opera house in Chicago as Turandot, but the company folded before opening. Basso Nicola Rossi-Lemeni, who also was to star in this opera, was aware that Tullio Serafin {{was looking for a}} {{dramatic}} soprano to cast as La Gioconda at the Arena di Verona. He later recalled the young Callas as being [...] "amazing—so strong physically and spiritually; so certain of her future. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>in</b> a big outdoor theatre like Verona's, this girl, with her courage and huge voice, would make a tremendous impact." [...] Subsequently he recommended Callas to retired tenor and impresario Giovanni Zenatello. During her audition, Zenatello became so excited that he jumped up and joined Callas in the act 4 duet. It was in this role that Callas made her Italian debut.|$|E

2500|$|While the {{insanity}} explanation {{was not uncommon}} during Swedenborg's own time, it is mitigated by his activity in the Swedish Riddarhuset (The House of the Nobility), the Riksdag (the Swedish parliament), and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Additionally, the system of thought in his theological writings is considered {{by some to be}} remarkably coherent. [...] Furthermore, he was characterized by his contemporaries as a [...] "kind and warm-hearted man", [...] "amiable in his meeting with the public", speaking [...] "easily and naturally of his spiritual experiences", with pleasant and interesting conversation... An English friend of Kant's who visited Swedenborg at Kant's behest described Swedenborg as a [...] "reasonable, pleasant and candid man and scholar". Of note here is Swedenborg's statement that he was commanded by the Lord to publish his writings and [...] "Do not believe that without this express command I would have thought of publishing things which <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>in</b> advance would make me look ridiculous and many people would think lies..." ...|$|E
