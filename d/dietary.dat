5|$|Carrots are 88% water, 4.7% sugar, 0.9% protein, 2.8% <b>dietary</b> fiber, 1% ash and 0.2% fat. Carrot <b>dietary</b> fiber {{comprises}} mostly cellulose, {{with smaller}} proportions of hemicellulose, lignin and starch. Free sugars in carrot include sucrose, glucose and fructose.|$|E
5|$|Deficiencies in {{vanadium}} {{result in}} reduced growth in rats. The U.S. Institute of Medicine has not confirmed that vanadium {{is an essential}} nutrient for humans, so neither a Recommended <b>Dietary</b> Intake nor an Adequate Intake have been established. <b>Dietary</b> intake is estimated at 6 to 18 µg/day, with less than 5% absorbed. The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) of <b>dietary</b> vanadium, beyond which adverse effects may occur, is set at 1.8 mg/day.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dietary</b> {{selenium}} {{comes from}} nuts, cereals and mushrooms. Brazil nuts are the richest <b>dietary</b> source (though this is soil-dependent, since the Brazil nut {{does not require}} high levels of the element for its own needs).|$|E
5|$|Most {{countries}} place <b>dietary</b> supplements in {{a special}} category under the general umbrella of foods, not drugs. As a result, the manufacturer, and not the government, has the responsibility of ensuring that its <b>dietary</b> supplement products are safe before they are marketed. Regulation of supplements varies widely by country. In the United States, a <b>dietary</b> supplement is defined under the <b>Dietary</b> Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. There is no FDA approval process for <b>dietary</b> supplements, and no requirement that manufacturers prove the safety or efficacy of supplements introduced before 1994. The Food and Drug Administration must rely on its Adverse Event Reporting System to monitor adverse events that occur with supplements. In 2007, the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21, part III took effect, regulating Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) in the manufacturing, packaging, labeling, or holding operations for <b>dietary</b> supplements. Even though product registration is not required, these regulations mandate production and quality control standards (including testing for identity, purity and adulterations) for <b>dietary</b> supplements. In the European Union, the Food Supplements Directive requires that only those supplements that have been proven safe can be sold without a prescription.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} for explanations involving <b>dietary</b> conservatism, in which predators avoid new prey {{because it is}} an unknown quantity; this is a long-lasting effect. <b>Dietary</b> conservatism has been demonstrated experimentally in some species of birds.|$|E
5|$|Advertising {{standards}} laws in many jurisdictions {{prohibit the}} use of the phrase kosher in a product's labelling unless the producer can show that the product conforms to Jewish <b>dietary</b> laws; however, different jurisdictions often define the legal qualifications for conforming to Jewish <b>dietary</b> laws differently. For example, in some places the law may require that a rabbi certify the kashrut nature, in others the rules of kosher are fully defined in law, and in others still it is sufficient that the manufacturer only believes that the product complies with Jewish <b>dietary</b> regulations. In several cases, laws restricting {{the use of}} the term kosher have later been determined to be illegal religious interference.|$|E
5|$|Average {{daily intake}} varies between 120 and 240 μg/day, which {{is higher than}} <b>dietary</b> recommendations. Pork, lamb, and beef liver each have {{approximately}} 1.5 parts per million of molybdenum. Other significant <b>dietary</b> sources include green beans, eggs, sunflower seeds, wheat flour, lentils, cucumbers and cereal grain.|$|E
5|$|Carnivorans include over 260 species, the {{majority}} of which eat meat as their primary <b>dietary</b> item. They have a characteristic skull shape and dentition.|$|E
5|$|Consumption of pelican, as {{with other}} seabirds, is {{considered}} non-kosher as an 'unclean animal', and thus forbidden in Jewish <b>dietary</b> law.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dietary</b> nickel {{may affect}} human health through infections by nickel-dependent bacteria, {{but it is}} also {{possible}} that nickel is an essential nutrient for bacteria residing in the large intestine, in effect functioning as a prebiotic. The U.S. Institute of Medicine has not confirmed that nickel is an essential nutrient for humans, so neither a Recommended <b>Dietary</b> Allowance (RDA) nor an Adequate Intake have been established. The Tolerable Upper Intake Level of <b>dietary</b> nickel is 1000µg/day as soluble nickel salts. <b>Dietary</b> intake is estimated at 70 to 100 µg/day, with less than 10% absorbed. What is absorbed is excreted in urine. Relatively large amounts of nickel – comparable to the estimated average ingestion above – leach into food cooked in stainless steel. For example, the amount of nickel leached after 10 cooking cycles into one serving of tomato sauce averages 88µg.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dietary</b> {{supplements}} often contain vitamins, but {{may also}} include other ingredients, such as minerals, herbs, and botanicals. Scientific evidence supports the benefits of <b>dietary</b> supplements for persons with certain health conditions. In some cases, vitamin supplements may have unwanted effects, especially if taken before surgery, with other <b>dietary</b> supplements or medicines, or if the person taking them has certain health conditions. They may also contain levels of vitamins many times higher, and in different forms, than one may ingest through food.|$|E

5|$|Raw durian is {{composed}} of 65% water, 27% carbohydrates (including 4% <b>dietary</b> fiber), 5% fat and 1% protein. In 100 grams, raw or fresh frozen durian provides 33% of the Daily Value (DV) of thiamin and moderate content of other B vitamins, vitamin C and the <b>dietary</b> mineral, manganese (15–24% DV, table).|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Institute of Medicine has not {{confirmed}} that boron {{is an essential}} nutrient for humans, so neither a Recommended <b>Dietary</b> Allowance (RDA) nor an Adequate Intake have been established. Adult <b>dietary</b> intake is estimated at 0.9 to 1.4 mg/day, with about 90% absorbed. What is absorbed is mostly excreted in urine. The Tolerable Upper Intake Level for adults is 20 mg/day.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Recommended <b>Dietary</b> Allowance (RDA) for {{teenagers}} and adults is 55µg/day.|$|E

5|$|This {{wide variety}} of prey items taken in various {{rainforest}} habitats {{is similar to the}} varied <b>dietary</b> composition noted occurring in the dry forests of western Madagascar, as well. As the largest endemic predator on Madagascar, this <b>dietary</b> flexibility combined with a flexible activity pattern has allowed it to exploit a {{wide variety of}} niches available throughout the island, making it a potential keystone species for the Madagascar ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|Wilson's {{disease is}} {{typically}} treated with <b>dietary</b> changes and medication. <b>Dietary</b> changes involve eating a low copper diet and not using copper cookware. Medications used include chelating agents such as trientine and d-penicillamine and zinc supplements. Complications of Wilson's disease can include liver failure, liver cancer, and kidney problems. A liver transplant {{may be helpful}} in those in whom other treatments are not effective or if liver failure occurs.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>dietary</b> {{antioxidants}} {{have been}} investigated for potential effects on neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, these studies have been inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the cattle}} egret {{sometimes}} feeds in shallow water, unlike most herons it is typically found in fields and dry grassy habitats, reflecting its greater <b>dietary</b> reliance on terrestrial insects rather than aquatic prey.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{mechanism}} in biological roles for chromium is unclear, <b>dietary</b> supplements for chromium include chromium(III) picolinate, chromium(III) polynicotinate, and related materials. The benefit of supplements {{has not been}} proven.|$|E
5|$|Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa) are {{harvested}} from an estimated 250,000400,000 trees per year. Highly valued edible nut {{used in the}} confectionery and baking trades. Excellent <b>dietary</b> source of selenium.|$|E
5|$|Claims {{have been}} made of a sugar–Alzheimer's disease connection, but debate {{continues}} over whether cognitive decline is attributable to <b>dietary</b> fructose or to overall energy intake.|$|E

5|$|Mild iron {{deficiency}} {{can be prevented}} or corrected by eating iron-rich foods and by cooking in an iron skillet. Because iron is a requirement for most plants and animals, {{a wide range of}} foods provide iron. Good sources of <b>dietary</b> iron have heme-iron, as this is most easily absorbed and is not inhibited by medication or other <b>dietary</b> components. Three examples are red meat, poultry, and insects. Non-heme sources do contain iron, though it has reduced bioavailability. Examples are lentils, beans, leafy vegetables, pistachios, tofu, fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals.|$|E
5|$|Potassium ions are {{necessary}} for the function of all living cells. The transfer of potassium ions through nerve cell membranes is necessary for normal nerve transmission; potassium deficiency and excess can each result in numerous abnormalities, including an abnormal heart rhythm and various electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities. Fresh fruits and vegetables are good <b>dietary</b> sources of potassium. The body responds to the influx of <b>dietary</b> potassium, which raises serum potassium levels, with a shift of potassium from outside to inside cells {{and an increase in}} potassium excretion by the kidneys.|$|E
5|$|Selenium may inhibit Hashimoto's disease, {{in which}} the body's own thyroid cells are {{attacked}} as alien. A reduction of 21% on TPO antibodies is reported with the <b>dietary</b> intake of 0.2mg of selenium.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises are omnivores, eating insects, other arthropods, small {{birds and}} reptiles, eggs, fruits, gums, nectar and {{miscellaneous}} vegetation. A 1984 {{study of the}} Sunda slow loris indicated that its diet consists of 71% fruit and gums, and 29% insects and other animal prey. A more detailed study of another Sunda slow loris population in 2002 and 2003 showed different <b>dietary</b> proportions, consisting of 43.3% gum, 31.7% nectar, 22.5% fruit, and just 2.5% arthropods and other animal prey. The most common <b>dietary</b> item was nectar from flowers of the Bertram palm (Eugeissona tristis). The Sunda slow loris eats insects that other predators avoid due to their repugnant taste or smell.|$|E
5|$|The European Union {{and other}} {{countries}} of Europe have regulations that define limits of vitamin (and mineral) dosages for their safe use as <b>dietary</b> supplements. Most vitamins that are sold as <b>dietary</b> supplements {{are not supposed to}} exceed a maximum daily dosage referred to as the Tolerable upper intake level (ULs). Vitamin products above these regulatory limits are not considered supplements and should be registered as prescription or non-prescription (over-the-counter drugs) due to their potential side effects. The European Union, United States, Japan and some other countries each set ULs.|$|E
