[...] In {{an effort to reduce}} the deer population to acceptable ecological limits, the preserve permitted archery hunting for the first time during the 2007 <b>deer</b> <b>season.</b> [...] The hunt yielded a substantial number of deer, including large bucks. [...] Archery hunting is still permitted {{in some parts of the}} preserve, provided that the hunter is properly licensed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, that the hunt occurs during the normal archery season, and subject to all other Commonwealth hunting statutes and regulations.|$|E

50|$|Game meat is {{typically}} {{taken from a}} wild animal that has been shot with a gun or bow. Once obtained, game meat must be processed. The method of processing varies by game species and size. Small game and fowl may simply be carried home to be butchered. Large game such as deer is quickly field-dressed by removing the viscera in the field, while very large animals like moose may be partially butchered in the field {{because of the difficulty}} of removing them intact from their habitat. Commercial processors often handle deer taken during <b>deer</b> <b>seasons,</b> sometimes even at supermarket meat counters. Otherwise the hunter handles butchering. The carcass is kept cool to minimize spoilage.|$|R
