40|$|Pasamonte is a clast-rich polymict basaltic breccia with O- and Cr-isotopic {{compositions}} {{that are}} resolved {{from those of}} most eucrites. It is dominated by two mafic clast types: (i) very-fine- to fine-grained, variolitic, subophitic and ophitic basalts, usually containing zoned pyroxenes; and (ii) fine- to medium grained <b>hypidiomorphic-granular</b> and allotriomorphic-granular microgabbros containing pyroxenes composed of augite lamellae in homogeneous pigeonite hosts. Minor clast types are fine-grained impact-melt, mafic-breccia and mafic-granular clasts; coarse matrix mineral fragments include pyroxene, plagioclase, silica, ferroan olivine and ilmenite. Our petrologic studies include determination of plagioclase compositions for the two major clast types and matrix grains, which we report here...|$|E
40|$|Chuquicamata, in {{northern}} Chile, is the world’s greatest copper orebody. It was controlled, {{from the initial}} intrusions (probably at 36 – 33 Ma) through mineralization (last major hydrothermal event at 31 Ma) to post-mineral brecciation and offset, by the West fault system. East porphyry, West porphyry, Banco porphyry, and Fine Texture porphyry make up the Chuqui Porphyry Complex. East porphyry, the dominant host rock, has a coarse, <b>hypidiomorphic-granular</b> texture. Intrusive contacts between most porphyries have not been found, but early ductile deformation, subsequent pervasive cataclastic deformation, and faulting affects all of the rocks and makes recognition of intrusive contacts very difficult. Potassic alteration affects all porphyries, comprises partial K feldspar and albite replacement of plagioclase, and more widespread biotite replacement of hornblende, with igneous texture largely preserved. It is accom-panied by granular quartz and quartz-K feldspar veinlets, which contain only trace disseminated chalcopyrite ± bornite remains from this early stage. Fine-grained quartz-K feldspar alteration, with destruction of biotite and apparently following albitization of plagioclase, accompanies strongest cataclastic deformation and de-struction of igneous texture. A band of quartz-K feldspar alteration, up to 200 m wide and 1, 500 m long, lies along the southward extension of Banco porphyry dikes and is the locus of the bornite-digenite center of th...|$|E
40|$|Carbonatites {{associated}} with alkalic rocks of the McClure Mountain and Gem Park Complexes, and the complex at Democrat Creek, {{can be classified}} into two distinct groups, replacement and primary magmatic, based on distinctive petrographic differences. These two groups also show ' distinctive differences in mineralogy and geochemistry. Replace-ment carbonatites hoxv textures indicating nearly complete pseudomorphous replacement of originally porphyritic or <b>hypidiomorphic-granular</b> igneous dike rocks by carbonate minerals. They contain an element suite characteristic of carbonatites {{as well as a}} trace element signature indicative of a mafic silicate precursor. Minerals containing thorium, niobium, and rare earth elements as essential constituents are generally rare. Primary magmatic carbonatites, which do not show the distinctive replacement textures, are also enriched in elements characteristic of carbonatites but contain greater average amounts of these elements than replacement carbonatites. Thorite, bastnaesite, synchisite, ancylite, and monazite are chiefly responsible for the high thorium and rare earth element content of these rocks compared to other igneous rocks. Primary magmatic carbonatites are spacially more closely {{associated with}} the alkalic intrusions than are replacement car-bonarites. which have a somewhat wider distribution. Field data and 3 • 80 and values support an igneous origin for primary magmatic carbonatites; isotopic values also indicate that the carbonatite replacing the earlier alkalic dikes also was derived from igneous sources. Exchange of isotopes between both types of carbonatite and nonigneous reservoirs appears to be minimal. Abundances of rare earth elements and niobium in carbonatites of the Wet Mountains are somewhat lower than those at other carbonatite localities containing economic or near-economic concentrations. Thorium is more abundant in closely related vein-type deposits than in the carbonatites...|$|E

The nested concentric body is zoned inward from a metaluminous rim to a muscovite-bearing peraluminous core. The pluton lies at or on the boundary between the moderately deformed Alisitos volcanic arc terrane to the west, and a highly deformed assemblage of metasedimentary rocks of cratonal derivation. Host rocks include several smaller, older plutons. Bodies of two-mica garnet rocks along the eastern escarpment crosscut the large zoned pluton. The mineralogy varies from hornblende-biotite tonalite with abundant sphene at the rim, through rocks with larger proportions of biotite to hornblende, to biotite granodiorite with no hornblende, to muscovite-biotite granodiorite with no sphene in the core. The proportions of plagioclase, potassium feldspar, and quartz vary within a narrow range. Three mineralogical zones with gradational contacts are recognized: A hornblende-biotite zone, biotite zone, and muscovite-biotite zone. The two-mica zone is divided into the outer core facies, containing muscovite that is visible in hand-specimen, and the inner core facies, where muscovite can be identified only in thin-section. The sequence of nucleation for the pluton is hornblende, biotite, plagioclase, muscovite, quartz, and potassium feldspar. The texture of the pluton is mostly medium-to coarse-grained <b>hypidiomorphic-granular.</b> Quartz is interstitial outward and megacrystic inward. Potassium feldspar is interstitial, with oikocrysts present {{toward the center of the}} pluton. Biotite pseudomorphs after hornblende are most apparent in the gradational boundary where hornblende disappears. Inclusions and dikes are numerous, particularly near the margins. Foliation is strongest near the rim, decreasing rapidly inward, so that none is observed in the core. Foliation suggests that the pluton is asymmetrical, funnel-shaped downward, and inclined to the east. Compositional zones are crescent-shaped and asymmetric, stepping progressively eastward. Major-element chemistry reveals regular variation across the pluton. From rim to core, SiO 2 increases and A 12 O 3, CaO, total Fe, TiO 2, and MgO decrease. K 2 O and Na 2 O remain relatively constant. Whole-rock concentrations of Ba, Sr, Rb, and Zr are relatively constant across the pluton, revealing no distinct trends. Enrichment of the light rare earth elements and lack of a Europium anomaly is seen in all zones. The pluton grades from metaluminous to peraluminous with A/CNK values as high as 1. 14. Normative corundum ranges up to 2. 15...|$|E
