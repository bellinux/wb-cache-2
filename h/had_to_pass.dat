5|$|The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn The {{membership}} and ritual of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn were strongly linked to Freemasonry, but membership {{was open to}} non-masons and to women.

5|$|Alexios had {{anticipated}} {{help in the}} form of mercenary forces from the West, but he was totally unprepared for the immense and undisciplined force that soon arrived in Byzantine territory. It was no comfort to Alexios to learn that four of the eight leaders of {{the main body of the}} Crusade were Normans, among them Bohemund. Since the crusade <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> through Constantinople, however, the Emperor had some control over it. He required its leaders to swear to restore to the empire any towns or territories they might reconquer from the Turks on their way to the Holy Land. In return, he gave them guides and a military escort.|$|E
5|$|Before being {{exported}} {{from the}} district, all furs <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> through depots manned by a quarantine officer {{appointed by the}} Board of Health. Any furs believed to have {{come into contact with}} parts of the district infected by smallpox were to be destroyed. This led to some problems for the Government of Canada after the Council was dissolved. Some people whose furs had been destroyed under these regulations applied to the Government for compensation, as no mechanism was put in place when the Act was drafted. These claims for compensation were considered, but ultimately ignored.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century unknown to {{everyone}} including his family, socialist patriot Manwel Dimech was imprisoned by the British at the Castellania until a well planned forced {{exit from the}} country on 5 September 1914, which took him in exile and never to come to Malta again. A plaque in the whereabouts of the Victoria Gate, where Dimech <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> before boarding on a ship, commemorates the episode. The imprisonment of Dimech at the Castellania, and his exile abroad, is considered as a landmark injustice during the British period.|$|E
5|$|Travel between Haifa and {{the center}} of the country is {{possible}} by road with Highway 2, the main highway along the coastal plain, beginning at Tel Aviv and ending at Haifa. Furthermore, Highway 4 runs along the coast to the north of Haifa, as well as south, inland from Highway 2. In the past, traffic along Highway 2 to the north of Haifa <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> through the downtown area of the city; the Carmel Tunnels, opened for traffic 1 December 2010, now route this traffic under Mount Carmel, reducing congestion in the downtown area.|$|E
5|$|After the German Army {{captured}} much of Belgium {{following the}} Battle of the Frontiers in 1914, the Allied forces were left holding a thin strip of coastline {{to the west}} of the Yser. The remainder of the Belgian coast came under the occupation of German Marine Divisions, including the important strategic ports of Antwerp and Bruges. A network of canals connected Bruges with the coast at Ostend and Zeebrugge, through which small warships such as destroyers, light cruisers and submarines could travel and find a safe harbour from which to launch raids into the English Channel and along the coasts of southeast England. U-boats could also depart from Bruges at night, cutting a day off the journey to the Western Approaches, more easily avoiding the North Sea Mine Barrage and allowing U-boat captains to gain familiarity with the net and mine defences of the English Channel, through which they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> to reach the main battlegrounds of the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|Both teams <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> {{through five}} rounds {{before they reached}} the final. They both entered in the third {{qualifying}} round and won their respective groups before they reached the knockout stage, where matches were contested over two legs, with a match at each team's home ground. Milan's victories varied from close affairs to comfortable victories. They defeated Celtic by a single goal over two legs, while they beat Manchester United 5–3 on aggregate in the semi-final. Liverpool's matches were mainly all close affairs; they beat defending champions Barcelona on the away goals rule in the first knockout round and beat Chelsea in a penalty shootout in the semi-finals, although they did record a 4–0 aggregate win over PSV Eindhoven in the quarter-finals.|$|E
5|$|From Exit 4, {{the turnpike}} {{continues}} on a due north course, crossing Slate Creek, {{before coming to}} the Southern Terminal barrier toll plaza, where tickets are issued for all northbound traffic and fares are collected from southbound traffic. The next interchange north of the toll plaza is Exit 19 (Wellington), serving US-160, which heads west to Wellington, the county seat of Sumner County, and east to Winfield, the seat of adjoining Cowley County. It is the first of many trumpet interchanges, serving the surface road via a connector road with a toll plaza. When the turnpike first opened, the US-160 interchange was a reversed diamond with four loop ramps, so that all traffic using the interchange <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> under the bridge and thus through the toll plaza. The new configuration was built c. 1988.|$|E
5|$|In 1847, Ezra Cornell of Ithaca, New York {{worked to}} expand telegraphic {{communication}} through the New York and Lake Erie Railroad right-of-way with the Western Union Telegraph Company, saving a telegraph line he built from New York City to Fredonia. The new telegraph {{was an instant}} hit, and was commonly used for gossip and casual chatting. The then-superintendent of the New York and Lake Erie, Charles Minot, looked to expand this new technology with the railroad. He developed a system using telegraphs for train dispatches, for use when trains would want to pass one another along the line, such as at stations. Two-letter telegraph codes were designated, and the new modern system was set up. For the ten years of the new railroad's existence, passengers had been disgusted as trains waited for hours as another train <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> them. This new system would relieve this issue.|$|E

This works nicely for the rotation group [...] and the Lorentz group , but it does not work when the symmetry group is the Galilean group. In this case one <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> its central extension, the Bargmann group, which is the symmetry group of the Schrödinger equation.

5|$|In 1915, the {{building}} was in use as a naval hospital when fire damaged much of the interior, but was confined to the newer additions by Barry. Scottish architect Sir Robert Lorimer was engaged to renovate the house following the First World War. When the 5th Duke died in 1963, the Earldom and the house went to his niece, the current Countess of Sutherland, while the Dukedom <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> to a male heir and went to John Egerton, Earl of Ellesmere. Between 1965 and 1972, the house became a boarding school for boys, taking on forty boys and five teachers in its first year. Since 1973, the house and grounds have been open to the public, with private accommodation retained {{for the use of}} the Sutherland family.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the United States {{provided}} {{funding for}} DynCorp International and Pacific Architects & Engineers, private military contractors, to train a new 4,000-man Liberian military. DynCorp was made responsible for individual training and PA unit training. In June–July 2005 the projected force strength {{was reduced to}} 2000 men. DynCorp and the U.S. Embassy scrutinized the personnel for the new armed forces thoroughly. Recruits <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> a literacy test, an aptitude test, a drug test and an HIV test, and their names and faces were put on posters which are distributed {{to try to make}} sure none have a history of war crimes or other human rights violations. A new batch of 500 screened personnel started to arrive at the Camp Ware base at VOA Careysburg, inland from Monrovia, for initial training in early November 2007, joining 608 others who had graduated earlier.|$|E
5|$|In a {{scene in}} the episode, Homer and Bart exit the Magic Palace's gift shop, only {{to end up in}} another gift shop. The scene was based on an {{experience}} of the episode's show runner Mike Scully, who, in order to exit the Lance Burton Theatre after a magic show, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> through a gift shop. The ending scene of the episode went through several changes and was as a result completed late in the episode's production. The writers had conceived the courtroom scene, but they were stuck {{trying to come up with}} an ending after Skinner had been shot. They eventually decided that the trial was a scam staged by the townspeople, and Simpsons writer George Meyer pitched the surfing scene that closed the episode.|$|E

5|$|In {{the days}} after the storm, airstrikes and attacks {{continued}} elsewhere in the country, and only days after Chapala, Cyclone Megh followed a similar path, causing additional damage. Relief distribution was disrupted due to the poor communications in the region, worsened by the ongoing civil war, with the hardest hit areas under al-Qaeda control; aid trucks <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> security clearances, resulting in delays. Workers began restoring communications and clearing roads in {{the days after}} the storm. By 19November, most of the displaced residents had returned home, although some remained in shelters due to house damage. Southern portions of Yemen saw food and fuel shortages following the two storms. Mukalla experienced an outbreak of dengue fever by January 2016 due to the floods, affecting 1,040people; earlier efforts to kill disease carrying mosquitoes were ineffective due to residual floods and unsanitary conditions. Seven people died due to the outbreak. A locust outbreak also began in December 2015 due to the floods.|$|E
5|$|On 28 March, the Greek Central Macedonia Army Section—comprising the 12th and 20th Infantry Divisions—were {{put under}} the command of General Wilson, who {{established}} his headquarters to the north-west of Larissa. The New Zealand division took position north of Mount Olympus, while the Australian division blocked the Haliacmon valley up to the Vermion range. The RAF continued to operate from airfields in Central and Southern Greece; however, few planes could be diverted to the theater. The British forces were near to fully motorised, but their equipment was more suited to desert warfare than to Greece's steep mountain roads. They were short of tanks and anti-aircraft guns and the lines of communication across the Mediterranean were vulnerable, because each convoy <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> close to Axis-held islands in the Aegean; despite the British Royal Navy's domination of the Aegean Sea. These logistical problems were aggravated by the limited availability of shipping and Greek port capacity.|$|E
5|$|Records {{of signals}} sent between the {{aircraft}} and a communications satellite over the Indian Ocean {{revealed that the}} aircraft had continued flying for almost six hours after its final sighting on Malaysian military radar. Initial analysis of these communications determined that Flight 370 was along one of two arcs—equidistant from the satellite—when its last signal was sent; the same day this analysis was publicly disclosed, 15 March, authorities announced they would abandon search efforts in the South China Sea, Gulf of Thailand, and Strait of Malacca to focus their efforts on the two corridors. The northern arc—from northern Thailand to Kazakhstan—was soon discounted as the aircraft would have <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> through heavily militarised airspace and those countries claimed their military radar would have detected an unidentified aircraft entering their airspace.|$|E
