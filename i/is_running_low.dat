2500|$|At 7:42am Earhart radioed [...] "We {{must be on}} you, but cannot see you—but gas <b>is</b> <b>running</b> <b>low.</b> Have {{been unable}} to reach you by radio. We are flying at 1,000 feet [...]" [...] Her 7:58am {{transmission}} said she couldn't hear the Itasca {{and asked them to}} send voice signals so she could try to take a radio bearing. This transmission was reported by the Itasca as the loudest possible signal, indicating Earhart and Noonan were in the immediate area. They couldn't send voice at the frequency she asked for, so Morse code signals were sent instead. Earhart acknowledged receiving these but said she was unable to determine their direction.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{researchers}} believe that the Electra ran out of fuel while searching for Howland Island and that Earhart and Noonan ditched at sea. The plane would have carried enough fuel to reach Howland with some extra to spare. The extra fuel would cover some contingencies such as headwinds and searching for Howland. The plane could fly a compass course toward Howland through the night. In the morning, the time of apparent sunrise would allow the plane to determine its line of position (a sun line that ran 157–337). From that line, the plane could determine how much further it must travel before reaching a parallel sun line that ran through Howland. At 6:14 AM Itasca time, Earhart estimated they were 200 miles away from Howland. As the plane closed with Howland, it {{expected to be in}} radio contact with Itasca. With the radio contact, the plane should be able to use radio direction finding (RDF) to head directly for the Itasca and Howland. Unfortunately, the plane was not receiving a radio signal from Itasca, so it would be unable to determine an RDF bearing to the ship. Although Itasca was receiving HF radio signals from the plane, it did not have HF RDF equipment, so it could not determine a bearing to the plane. The communications going to the plane were almost non-existent. Consequently, the plane was not directed to Howland; it was left on its own with little fuel. Presumably, the plane reached the parallel sun line and started searching for Howland on that line of position. At 7:42 AM, Earhart reported, [...] "We must be on you, but cannot see you – but gas <b>is</b> <b>running</b> <b>low.</b> Have been unable to reach you by radio. We are flying at 1,000 feet." [...] At 8:43 AM, Earhart reported, [...] "We are on the line 157 337. We will repeat this message. We will repeat this on 6210 kilocycles. Wait." ...|$|E
