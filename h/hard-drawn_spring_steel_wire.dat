The current work gives {{an overview of the}} quasi-static properties of <b>spring</b> <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> reinforced EN AW- 6082 with varying reinforcing ratio. The deformation and damage behaviour is investigated in detail for a reinforcing ratio of 11. 1 vol. %. It is shown that the relatively ductile behaviour of the <b>spring</b> <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> leads to multiple necking resulting in higher strains than expected. Current models are expanded and modified for a proper adaptation to the material system...|$|R

50|$|Wire {{has many}} uses. It forms the raw {{material}} of many important manufacturers, such as the wire netting industry, engineered springs, wire-cloth making and wire rope spinning, in which it occupies a place analogous to a textile fiber. Wire-cloth of all degrees of strength and fineness of mesh is used for sifting and screening machinery, for draining paper pulp, for window screens, and for many other purposes. Vast quantities of aluminium, copper, nickel and <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> are employed for telephone and data cables, and as conductors in electric power transmission, and heating. It is in no less demand for fencing, and much is consumed {{in the construction of}} suspension bridges, and cages, etc. In the manufacture of stringed musical instruments and scientific instruments, wire is again largely used. Carbon and stainless <b>spring</b> <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> have significant applications in engineered springs for critical automotive or industrial manufactured parts/components. Pin and hairpin making; the needle and fish-hook industries; nail, peg, and rivet making; and carding machinery consume large amounts of wire as feedstock.|$|R
500|$|The {{crinoline}} {{began to}} fall out of fashion from about 1866. A modified version, the crinolette, was a transitional garment bridging the gap between the cage crinoline and the bustle. Fashionable from 1867 through to the mid-1870s, the crinolette was typically composed of half-hoops, sometimes with internal lacing or ties designed to allow adjustment of fullness and shape. The crinolette was still worn in the early 1880s, with an 1881 article describing it as sticking out solely behind, as opposed to projecting [...] "hideously at the side" [...] like the crinoline. It is possible that some of the smaller crinolines that survive were worn in combination with separate bustles, rather than in isolation. During the 1880s the cage crinoline was revived, with hoop petticoats designed to accommodate the extremely large bustles of the period and support the skirt hems. One of the mid-1880s styles was called the lobster pot due to its resemblance to a lobster trap. Due to the extreme weight of the fabrics of the decade, the hoops of the crinolines were crossed over each other behind the legs in order to support and hold the skirts firmly in place. As with the earlier cage crinolines, <b>sprung</b> <b>steel,</b> <b>wire</b> and cane were used.|$|R

5|$|The cage {{crinoline}} {{made out}} of <b>spring</b> <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> was first introduced in the 1850s, with the earliest British patent for a metal crinoline (described as a 'skeleton petticoat of <b>steel</b> <b>springs</b> fastened to tape.') granted in July 1856. Alison Gernsheim suggests that the unidentified French inventor was probably R. C. Milliet of Besançon, as the July 1856 patent was filed by their British agent, C. Amet. Milliet had already patented a 'tournure de femme' in Paris on 24 April 1856 which was described as comprising 'elastic extensible circles joined together by vertical bands.' Following its introduction, the women's rights advocate Amelia Bloomer felt that her concerns about the hampering nature of multiple petticoats had been resolved, and dropped dress reform as an issue. Diana de Marly, in her biography of the couturier Charles Frederick Worth noted that by 1858 there existed steel factories catering solely to crinoline manufacturers, and shops that sold nothing else but crinolines. One {{of the most significant}} manufacturers of crinolines was that of Thomson & Co., founded by an American with branches across Europe and the United States. At the height of their success, up to four thousand crinolines were produced by Thomson's London factory in a day, whilst another plant in Saxony manufactured 9.5 million crinolines over a twelve-year period. In 1859 the New York factory, which employed about a thousand girls, used 300,000yards of <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> every week to produce between three and four thousand crinolines per day, while the rival Douglas & Sherwood factory in Manhattan used a ton of steel each week in manufacturing hoop skirts.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{modeling}} method and dynamical characteristics of <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes {{has been researched}} for several decades. In the past, <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes were usually modeled as a two dimensional system, which was only suitable for the planar motion. Also, no kink-wave propagation was considered when <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes were used in relatively low speed engineering application areas. By contrast, a three dimensional approach to model <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes used in high energy absorber apparatus is presented in this paper. Three dimensional contacts between <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes and other objects and kink-wave propagation in <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes are taken into consideration when applying the new approach to model <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes. Compared to the two dimensional model of <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes, the proposed model regards <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes as a multi-body system consisting of identical cylindrical elements with {{6 degrees of freedom}} connected by space constraints. Impact forces generated by three dimensional contacts between <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes and other objects are calculated and theories of elastic wave propagation are applied to analyze the kink-wave propagation when <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes are loaded with a sudden perpendicular impact by a high speed moving object. In addition, mathematical model of <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes is established and numerical simulation of the three dimensional model of <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes is implemented. By comparing the simulation results with the experimental data available, the model of <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes proposed in this paper is demonstrated to be valid and correct. Therefore, the proposed {{modeling method}} can be treated as a new approach in the research field of modeling <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes. The dynamical characteristics of the <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes based on this new modeling approach are addressed simultaneously and plots of the dynamics of <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes cannot only be regarded as a basis for the further comparative studies, but also can provide some significant and interesting results...|$|R

High strength, low relaxation <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes with minor radius, high tensile strain and good corrosion resistance were used in this reinforcement. The construction process for strengthening with prestressed <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes—including wire rope measuring, extruding anchor heads making, anchorage installing, tensioning <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes and pouring mortar was described.

To investigate effectiveness of the strengthening method, fielding-load tests were carried out before and after strengthening. The results of concrete strain and deflection show that the flexural strength and stiffness of the strengthened beam are improved.
