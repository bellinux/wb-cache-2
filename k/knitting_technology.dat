40|$|This paper {{presents}} an innovative three-dimensional (3 D) fabric structure for composite reinforcement. Different from most conventional 3 D fabric structures, the new structure displays a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect under compression. Based on a manufacturing process developed by combining both non-weaving and <b>knitting</b> <b>technologies,</b> four NPR 3 D fabric samples with different warp yarn diameters were first manufactured manually. Then, their Poisson's ratio (PR) values under compression along the fabric thickness direction were experimentally evaluated. A geometrical model was also {{proposed for the}} theoretical calculation of PR values of these fabrics and was compared with experimental data. The good agreements were obtained between the calculation and experiment. The results show that all the 3 D fabrics display NPR effect under compression, which results in a unique feature that allows the structure to concentrate itself under the compressive load to better resist the load. This special feature makes this innovative 3 D fabric structure very attractive for many potential applications such as automobile, aerospace, defense and sports equipment, where impact protection can be a highly desirable property.

40|$|Complete garment <b>knitting</b> <b>technology</b> is {{a method}} of {{producing}} knitted products, generally fashion garments, ready-made directly in the knitting machine without additional operations such as cutting and sewing. This {{makes it possible to}} manufacture a knitted fashion garment with fewer processes then with conventional production methods. In the fashion business customer demand is always changing due to fashion trends, so to be able to manufacture and deliver products rapidly is important. Mass customisation is a customer co-design process of products and services that tries to meets the needs of an individual customer’s demand for certain product features. In the fashion business this means that the customer can order a garment with a customised style, colour, size, and other personal preferences. The principal objective of this dissertation was to examine if and how complete garment technology {{can be applied to the}} customisation of knitted fashion products. It was pursued through several independent studies in <b>knitting</b> <b>technology,</b> mass customisation, and fashion logistics against a theoretical frame of reference in these areas. The papers in this thesis present various examples of how knitted fashion garments can be customised and integrated into fashion retailing concepts. The starting point of the research was the Knit-on-Demand research project conducted at the Swedish School of Textiles in collaboration with a knitting manufacturing and retailing company. The aim was to develop a shop concept built on the complete garment technology where a garment could be customised, produced, and delivered as quickly as possible. This initial idea failed due to the expense of investing in complete garment <b>knitting</b> <b>technology,</b> and so other avenues of research had to be found. The Knit-on-Demand project continued, using a business model similar to the complete garment concept but with the retail store and the production unit situated in different locations. The overall research question addressed in this thesis is: How can complete garment <b>knitting</b> <b>technology</b> be applied in a retail concept for customised garments? This question is then divided in two problems: What are the fashion logistics effects of combining complete garment technology and mass customisation? How does the co-design process function in the customisation of knitted fashion garments?The following is a qualitative study based on five research articles applying different research methodologies: case studies, simulations, and interviews. The empirical context is the area of mass customisation of fashion products and <b>knitting</b> <b>technology,</b> more specifically called complete garment knitting production technology. No prior studies describing mass customisation of complete garment <b>knitting</b> <b>technology</b> in combination with fashion logistics were found in the literature. The main contribution of this study is the demonstration that complete garment <b>knitting</b> <b>technology</b> can be applied in the customisation of fashion products. It also illustrates the importance of the co-design process between the company and the customer through which a knitted garment can be customised, produced, and delivered to the customer in three to five hours.

40|$|This paper reports fabric {{circuit boards}} (FCBs), {{a new type}} of circuit boards, that are three-dimensionally deformable, highly stretchable, durable and {{washable}} ideally for wearable electronic applications. Fabricated by using computerized <b>knitting</b> <b>technologies</b> at ambient dry conditions, the resultant knitted FCBs exhibit outstanding electrical stability with less than 1 % relative resistance change up to 300 % strain in unidirectional tensile test or 150 % membrane strain in three-dimensional ball punch test, extraordinary fatigue life of more than 1 000 000 loading cycles at 20 % maximum strain, and satisfactory washing capability up to 30 times. To the best of our knowledge, the performance of new FCBs has far exceeded those of previously reported metalcoated elastomeric films or other organic materials in terms of changes in electrical resistance, stretchability, fatigue life and washing capability as well as permeability. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation illustrate that the structural conversion of knitted fabrics is attributed to the effective mitigation of strain in the conductive metal fibres, hence the outstanding mechanical and electrical properties. Those distinctive features make the FCBs particularly suitable for next-to-skin electronic devices.

40|$|The {{separation}} of the design and technical roles within commercial knitwear design {{has led to a}} 'technical skills gap' between designers and industrial <b>knitting</b> <b>technology,</b> which has contributed to the communication problems between designers and technicians. Historically, these issues have been ignored and designers have accepted compromised versions of their original ideas. However, the advent of seamless <b>knitting</b> <b>technology</b> has exacerbated the issue and the skills gap has grown exponentially, as designers struggle to engage with seamless knitting processes. The nature of seamless garment design is that all aspects must be considered simultaneously, and pattern-­‐cutting principles for two-­‐dimensional garment blanks are no longer relevant. The most crucial aspect of the design process is the programming of the garment, from which designers are generally excluded. The complexity of the programming has led to manufacturers creating wizard-­‐based functions that simplify and speed up the process, and produce standardised garment styles. The database of pre‐programmed garment styles has been held responsible for uniformity of garment silhouettes within the commercial fashion industry. This research develops a craft theory, that has broadly developed from David Pye and Peter Dormer’s seminal work up to the 1990 s, and locates it in relation to more contemporary work on digital craft. Programming is acknowledged as a form of digital craft and the Shima Seiki APEX CAD system and SWG-­‐N knitting machine are the craft tools. The creative experimental practice explores the possibilities of taking control of the programming and knitting of seamless garments, in terms of the creative design development of new seamless sleeve head styles. The practice is carried out within an 'experimental system' away from the constraints of industry. The data from semi-­‐structured interviews with commercial knitwear designers and technicians is discussed in relation to the 'communication bottleneck' identified by Claudia Eckert and the 'technology skills gap' identified by Sayer et al. Four scenarios for the design and manufacture of knitwear are identified and analysed in terms of the creative management of the design and sampling of seamless garments. The outcomes reflect on how the roles of designer and technician could be more interchangeable to better exploit seamless <b>knitting</b> <b>technology.</b> Concurrent design practices are considered in the light of a new slow fashion framework that exploits the new possibilities afforded by seamless <b>knitting</b> <b>technology.</b> This study presents the case that the design and technical aspects of knitwear design need to be reunited in order to create innovative seamless garments, and that this could either be as one role, such as technical designer, or within a design team made up of designer and technician. The artifacts created as part of this research illustrate the possibilities of a designer taking control of the whole process, and are products of a design methodology that incorporates digital tools with traditional design skills. However, it is acknowledged that to fully exploit the software one needs to be an expert craftsman, which, due to the complexity of the software, can take many years to achieve. Therefore, the culture of the knitwear industry needs change to actively encourage and facilitate teamwork, and the training of designers and technicians needs to reflect this change, if seamless <b>knitting</b> <b>technology</b> is to be fully exploited...|$|E

40|$|Flat {{knitting}} is {{a widely}} used fabric manufacturing technology. Compared with warp knitting and circular knitting, flat knitting is characterized by its higher process flexibility and greater fabric structure variety. In this work, flat <b>knitting</b> <b>technology</b> was exploited to fabricate auxetic fabrics which laterally expand when stretched. Three kinds of geometrical structures, i. e. foldable structure, rotating rectangle and reentrant hexagon, were employed as basic reference structures {{for the development of}} these kinds of auxetic fabrics. The weft knitting processes based on these structures were specially developed and auxetic fabrics were fabricated using the computerized flat knitting machines. The Poisson's ratio-strain curves of the developed fabrics were plotted and compared with those calculated using existing models to demonstrate the variation trends of Poisson's ratio with the axial strain. The results reveal that except the folded fabric formed with the face loops and reverse loops in a rectangular arrangement, of which the auxetic effect firstly increases and then decreases with the axial strain, the auxetic effects of all other fabrics decrease with an increase of the axial strain. The work also shows that auxetic fabrics can be realized based on knitted structures and that flat <b>knitting</b> <b>technology</b> can provide a simple, but highly effective way of fabricating auxetic fabrics from conventional yarns.

To gain insight into exogenous or external forces that may influence the fashion process, I considered urban lifestyle, education and status of women, leisure activities, swimming facilities, renowned swimmers, the Olympics, <b>knit</b> <b>technology,</b> water travel, drownings, life preservers, and public baths;Initial findings supported the thesis that women 2 ̆ 7 s bathing garments followed the dominant outerwear silhouette of the era. Visual data indicated women generally adopted the tank suit by 1915, while men and children adopted the style much earlier. However, descriptive data indicated that some women had also adopted this style earlier. Moreover, I found that women swam much earlier than generally assumed; that various functional attire was sanctioned for women engaged in exhibitions, competitions, teaching, and bathing at the bathhouses; and that many male swimmers encouraged and taught female relatives to swim;Many factors {{had an impact on}} functional swimwear, but I contend the public bath movement was the greatest influence. When people moved to the cities for employment, they lived in boarding houses with limited access to water for cleansing purposes. By the 1870 s free public bathhouses were established to curb disease, assimilate immigrants, improve morality, and meet middle-class standards of cleanliness. Although intended for the poor, the baths were regularly patronized by young working women, school girls, mothers with babies, and upper-class 2 ̆ 2 ladies 2 ̆ 2 on the days reserved solely for women. In the large 2 ̆ 2 swimming baths, 2 ̆ 2 female supervisors taught patrons of all ages and physical ability to swim. Since much transportation and leisure relied on water, swimming offered some insurance against drowning, a common occurrence;Bath patrons were required to wear simple, non-skirted swim suits. By 1900, thousands of women learned to swim in these garments. By 1915, when the public baths were no longer needed, women wore functional swimwear in public.

Method: A total of 21 dressings were made using <b>knitted</b> and crochet <b>technologies</b> and their absorbency was tested. Five non-adherent recipes were selected {{from a range of}} chemical formulations and the optimised non-adherent finishes were applied to the four best dressings. Their absorbency and non-adherent properties were evaluated. Results: The study demonstrated that rib cotton (RC), rib viscose (RV), crochet cotton medium (CCM) and crochet viscose medium (CVM) dressings possess high absorption and that five finishing recipes, C+D, A+G, I, I+N and I+G, impart high absorption as well as non-adherent properties. The finish I+G is superior in imparting non-adherence to RV dressing, both in dry and moist conditions. This means that irrigation with water, saline or sodium citrate solution before removing the dressing from a wound is not needed.
