40|$|Although the U. N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) {{has been}} signed and {{ratified}} by 168 countries, global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have increased substantially since the 1992 Rio Summit. In both developing countries (DCs) and industrialized countries (ICs), {{there has been}} a need to find mechanisms to facilitate environmentally sound mitigation strategies. This need {{led to the formation of}} Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ) at the first Conference-of the Parties (COP) in 1995. In Article 4 A, para 2 D, the COP established an AIJ pilot phase <b>in</b> which <b>Annex</b> I (<b>IC)</b> countries would enter into agreements to implement activities jointly with non-Annex I parties. DCs would engage in AIJ on a purely voluntary basis and all AIJ projects should be compatible with and supportive of national environment and development goals. AIJ does not imply GHG reduction commitments by DCs. Neither do all projects undertaken during the pilot phase qualify as a fulfillment of current commitment s of Annex I parties under the COP. The current pilot phase for AIJ ends in the year 2000, a date which may be extended. Current AIJ activities are largely focused on the energy sector. The Nordic countries, for example, feel that the most important potential areas for cooperation in AIJ are fuel conversion, more effective energy production, increased energy efficiency, and reforms in energy-intensive industry (Nordic Council of Ministers, 1995). Denmark does not want to include non-energy sector projects such as carbon sink enhancement projects in the pilot phase (Nordic Council of Ministers, 1995). However, other countries, including the US, have already funded a number of forestry sector projects (Development Alternatives, 1997). Moreover, energy-sector projects involving high technology or capital-intensive technology are often a source of controversy between DCs and ICs regarding the kind of technology transferred and sharing of costs and benefits. Further, the pilot phase provide s an opportunity for capacity-building and learning about methods of planning, implementation, and monitoring of GHG abatement in land-based non-energy sector projects...|$|R
50|$|All {{projects}} are either classified as Annex 1 or Annex 2 projects. Those lying <b>in</b> <b>Annex</b> 1 are large scale developments such as motorways, chemical works, bridges, powerstations etc. These always require an EIA under the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive (85,337,EEC as amended). Annex 2 {{projects are}} smaller in scale than those referred to <b>in</b> <b>Annex</b> 1. Member States must determine whether these project shall be made {{subject to a}}n assessment subject {{to a set of}} criteria set out <b>in</b> <b>Annex</b> 3 of codified Directive 2011/92/EU.|$|R
