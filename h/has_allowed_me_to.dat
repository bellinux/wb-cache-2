25|$|The P.A.B.C. {{initiative}} (Public Art Building Communities), <b>has</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> make {{a bridge}} between the community, the Restaurant Mama Ayesha’s, the arts and all the people who have made this mural a reality. This could not be done without the support of all the community and the help of the DC Commission and the Restaurant and all the entities who funded the project. I hope that this mural will become a teaching tool of the History of the Presidents for schools, children and the public in general. This is a gift to the City of Washington DC to celebrate this historical moment in American History and will remain open to the public to see for generations to come. This is fulfilling the idea that mural art is available for the public and for the masses.|$|E
500|$|Having {{experienced}} both {{avenues of}} recording {{on a major}} label and later choosing to be an independent artist, a combination of musicianship with business know-how has helped give Joseph staying power in the notoriously competitive world of music. [...] He {{spends most of his}} time writing songs, composing arrangements, making recordings, and publishing and distributing his works. [...] "I'm my own boss. I can do what I want. I can change directions", he told West Central Tribune's Anne Polta. [...] As an independent, business is a prime concern and can take over if not controlled, Joseph said. [...] "A lot of musicians don't learn the business. You just have to be well-rounded in both areas. You have to understand publishing. You have to understand how you make money, what's in demand, what helps you make the most out of your talent." [...] "I couldn't license my music if it wasn't mine", he said. [...] "It <b>has</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> create CDs. It separates you from the million other great players." ...|$|E

[...] She appeared on chat shows ITV Breakfast and Live with Gabby in 2011, and returned to television in March 2013 as a guest on The Alan Titchmarsh Show. She took a job in Brighton, and has a blog that she started during the production of My Transsexual Summer. In the spring of 2013, she started HRT. 2013 was also the inaugural year of Trans* Pride Brighton, the first transgender pride festival in the UK, and she and Fox Fisher served on the organisation committee. In 2015 Sarah and Fox published a picture book, Are You a Boy or are You a Girl?, which Sarah wrote and Fox illustrated. [...] "Before I started transitioning, I never wrote, I never... did anything creative," [...] said Sarah in a 2013 interview. [...] "For some reason... living in a female role <b>has</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be more creative." ...|$|E

500|$|The album {{earned the}} accolades for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Engineered Album, and was {{nominated}} for Album of the Year, at the 16th Annual Latin Grammy Awards. About the nominations, Lafourcade said to the newspaper Al Día, [...] "I am very grateful to the people because this album <b>has</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> reach them in a closer way, create a complicity... I feel very happy and with high expectations, regardless of whether we get the Latin Grammy or not". Billboard columnist Leila Cobo, while reviewing the nominees for the Latin Grammy Award for Album of the Year, stated {{that this is a}} [...] "breakthrough album" [...] for the singer, since she is going [...] "beyond her alt roots into commercial territory but with finesse and guts that stay close to her origins". Hasta la Raíz won a Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album. The album ranked at number-one in the list for the [...] "10 Best Albums of 2015 in Mexico" [...] by newspaper El País; according to the reviewer Luis Pablo Beauregard, it is an album [...] "naked and raw, where the lyrics and fragility of her voice draw the footprint of heartbreak". The American edition of Rolling Stone magazine placed Hasta la Raíz at number 3 in the list for the [...] "10 Best Latin Albums of the Year", arguing that [...] "the loftiness of the album's ambitions are tempered by Lafourcade's masterful songwriting, which remains as deft as a Mesut Özil cross pass". The editors of Billboard magazine ranked the album at number 2 in the list for the [...] "10 Best Latin Albums of 2015", stating that the singer [...] "manages to be retro and futuristic at the same time ... the sound is so unexpected, that coupled with Lafourcade's sweet vocals, it's arresting". Website AllMusic included the album on their list for the [...] "Best of 2015: Favorite Latin and World Albums", explaining that Lafourcade [...] "delivers an intimate, poignant, quietly powerful collection of heartbreak songs on this gem of an album".|$|E

Since then, Lemarie and Pirès have married and had a son named Theo, born 11 July 2007.|$|E

The nonprofit organization mentored at-risk youth and provided free medical services, childhood immunizations, tattoo removal for gang members, and camps for chronically ill children. Muncie also led a program that mentored athletes at his alma mater in Berkeley. In his later years, he also ran a recruiting service evaluating high school football players.

2500|$|Crichton {{traveled}} to Junction, Texas, {{during the campaign}} to meet with former Democratic Governor Coke Stevenson, the official loser by eighty-seven votes in the 1948 runoff primary for the U.S. Senate against Lyndon Johnson. Stevenson had supported John Tower in the 1960 senatorial general election against Johnson and was backing Goldwater in 1964 {{as well in the}} presidential contest. Stevenson told Crichton that the election [...] "is an important part of American history, for it got Lyndon to the Senate, which he later controlled, and was a stepping stone to his becoming President. As for me, I was depressed for quite a while, but in retrospect it <b>has</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> enjoy my ranch and my young daughter. With that, we had another bourbon and branch water, and I thanked him and departed." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{mixture of}} {{material}} in Nights of Fire! includes Brazilian samba, Cuban salsa, Spanish flamenco, Argentine tango, even African tribal chants and drums. The production received an Emmy for its costumes. [...] Benise says, [...] "I appreciate music {{from all over}} the world and I believe that feeling <b>has</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> embrace them all, to incorporate them into the songs that I write, the music we sing, the shows we perform. When people ask what it is, I tell them it’s a combination of blues, jazz, salsa, rock and more, but in a hipper style." [...] Some describe Roni Benise's Nights of Fire! as a cross between Latin Riverdance and Cirque du Soleil. The 40-person cast includes exotic drums, Gypsy violin, flamenco dancers, circus performers, Brazilian samba dancers and percussionists, African tribal drummers, horns and lighting technicians. [...] The music also fits into new-age and smooth jazz radio formats.|$|E

"I am {{the less}} {{surprised}} at what has happened," [...] replied Sir William, [...] "from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life <b>has</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> acquire.

60|$|What is {{the secret}} of the {{attraction}} that there is for me in this man? Does it only mean that I feel the contrast between the frankly kind manner in which he <b>has</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> become acquainted with him, and the merciless dislike and distrust with which I am met by other people? Or is there really something in him which answers to the yearning that I have for a little human sympathy--the yearning, which has survived the solitude and persecution of many years; which seems to grow keener and keener, as the time comes nearer and nearer when I shall endure and feel no more? How useless to ask these questions! Mr. Blake has given me a new interest in life. Let that be enough, without seeking to know what the new interest is.|$|E

He <b>has</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> marry his daughter, and because I did not make a bargain with him as another man would have done, he denies me the fortune I had a right to expect with you. You know that the Israelites despoiled the Egyptians, and it was taken as a merit on their part. Your father is an Egyptian to me, and I will despoil him. You can tell him that I say so if you please." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her {{mother was}} surely {{the right person}} to say a word of comfort to her. Randal made the suggestion--with the worst {{possible}} result. Mrs. Presty had not forgotten that she had been told--at her age, in her position as the widow of a Cabinet Minister--to hold her tongue. [...] "Your brother has insulted me," [...] she said to Randal. He was weak enough to attempt to make an explanation. [...] "I was speaking of my brother's wife," [...] he said. [...] "Your brother's wife <b>has</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be insulted." [...] Having received that reply, Randal could only wonder. This woman went to church every Sunday, and kept a New Testament, bound in excellent taste, on her toilet-table! The occasion suggested reflection on the system which produces average Christians at the present time. Nothing more was said by Mrs. Presty; Mrs. Linley remained absorbed in her own bitter thoughts. In silence they waited for the return of the carriage, and the appearance of the governess.|$|E
