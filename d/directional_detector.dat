40|$|Directional {{detection}} of Dark Matter is a promising search strategy. However, to perform such detection, a given {{set of parameters}} has to be retrieved from the recoiling tracks : direction, sense and position in the detector volume.

40|$|The {{search for}} weakly {{interacting}} massive particles (WIMPs) by direct detection faces an en- croaching background due to coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering. As {{the sensitivity of}} these ex- periments improves, {{the question of how}} to best distinguish a dark matter signal from neutrinos will become increasingly important. A proposed method of overcoming this so-called “neutrino floor” is to utilize the directional signature that both neutrino and dark matter induced recoils possess. We show that directional experiments can indeed probe WIMP-nucleon cross-sections below the neutrino floor with little loss in sensitivity due to the neutrino background. In particular we find at low WIMP masses (around 6 GeV) the discovery limits for <b>directional</b> <b>detectors</b> penetrate be- low the non-directional limit by several orders of magnitude. For high WIMP masses (around 100 GeV), the non-directional limit is overcome by a factor of a few. Furthermore we show that even for <b>directional</b> <b>detectors</b> which can only measure 1 - or 2 -dimensional projections of the 3 -dimensional recoil track, the discovery potential is only reduced by a factor of 3 at most. We also demonstrate that while the experimental limitations of <b>directional</b> <b>detectors,</b> such as sense recognition and finite angular resolution, have a detrimental effect on the discovery limits, it is still possible to overcome the ultimate neutrino background faced by non-directional detectors...|$|R

40|$|The {{framework}} of non-relativistic {{effective field theory}} (NREFT) aims to generalise the standard analysis of direct detection experiments in terms of spin-dependent (SD) and spin-independent (SI) interactions.
