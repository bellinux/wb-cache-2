40|$|This article {{describes}} a test program on cold-formed stainless steel square hollow section (SHS) subjected to pure axial compression. A {{series of tests}} was compressed between fixed ends. The specimens were cold-rolled from stainless steel sheets. The tests were performed over a range of column lengths, which involved local buckling and overall flexural buckling. Measurements of overall geometric imperfections and material properties of the specimens were conducted. The experimental column strengths were compared with the design strengths predicted by the American, Australian/New Zealand and <b>European</b> <b>specifications</b> for coldformed stainless steel structures. Generally, the three specifications conservatively predict {{the strengths of the}} tested fixed-ended cold-formed stainless steel SHS columns. However, the design rules in the Australian/New Zealand Standard are slightly more reliable than the design rules in the American and <b>European</b> <b>specifications.</b> (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation into}} the column strength of cold-formed stainless steel rectangular hollow sections is described in this paper. The columns tested displayed four cross-section sizes and were compressed between fixed ends. The tests were performed over a range of column lengths {{in order to obtain}} a column curve for each series of tests. The failure modes of the columns involved local buckling, overall flexural buckling, and combined local and overall buckling. The test strengths are compared with the design strengths predicted using the American, Australian/New Zealand, and <b>European</b> <b>specifications</b> for cold-formed stainless steel structures. The design strengths were calculated using the material properties obtained from both tensile coupon and stub column tests. It is concluded that the design strengths predicted by the three specifications are generally conservative. Reliability analysis of the design rules in the three specifications is performed.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} an experimental {{investigation into the}} column strengths of cold-formed stainless steel rectangular hollow sections (RHS). A series of tests consisting of four cross-section sizes was compressed between fixed ends. The tests were performed over a range of column lengths, such that column curves were obtained for each series of tests. The failure modes of the columns involved local buckling, overall flexural buckling and interaction of local and overall buckling. The test strengths are compared with the design strengths predicted using the American, Australian/New Zealand and <b>European</b> <b>specifications</b> for cold-formed stainless steel structures. The design strengths were calculated using the material properties obtained from tensile coupon tests and stub column tests.
