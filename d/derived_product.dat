40|$|Therapeutic agents, in general, undergo {{chemical}} alteration in {{the body}} to form derivatives of the parent compound. Isolation and pharmacological assay of the various transformation products may yield valuable information {{in the search for}} better therapeutic agents, in studies on the mechanism of drug action and in the elucidation of normal metabolic processes. The therapeutic effect of a drug could be limited by a chemical change which results in a less active or an inactive product. Knowledge of the nature of this metabolic product may suggest the introduction of substituents in the parent drug that would prevent the transformation and thereby enhance its activity. On the other hand, {{it is possible that the}} parent drug itself is inert but produces a therapeutic effect incidental to the formation of a highly active metabolic product. Knowledge of the structure of this <b>derived</b> <b>product</b> may suggest a synthesis of more effective derivatives. Again, the toxicity of the drug could reside in a <b>derived</b> <b>product</b> the formation of which, if its structure be known, may be blocked by an appropriate modification of the parent drug...|$|E

40|$|With {{the advent}} of new remote sensors, the number and volume of remote-sensing data and its <b>derived</b> <b>products,</b> which are {{regarded}} as typical "big data," have grown exponentially. However, it remains a significant challenge to evaluate the quality of these big remote-sensing data and their <b>derived</b> <b>products.</b> Spatial sampling {{is necessary for the}} quality assessment of remote-sensing data and the <b>derived</b> <b>products.</b> This paper proposes an approach of multilevel stratified spatial sampling for the quality assessment of remote-sensing-derived products, with the aim of resolving the issue of the quality inspection of remote sensing big data and the <b>derived</b> <b>products.</b> The proposed multilevel stratified strategy: 1) makes full use of the prior knowledge of the data set; 2) selects a sample subset to get an unbiased estimator for the quality; 3) aims to acquire knowledge about the entire product; and 4) makes an evaluation based on statistical inference. The proposed method improves the sampling accuracy without increasing the inspection cost, and the whole procedure is repeatable and easily adopted for the quality inspection of remote-sensing-derived products and other geospatial data.
