25|$|From this point, {{different}} versions of the group were formed by members, some with cooperation of Farian, others without (for example by independently obtaining the rights to use the Boney M. name in a different country). One version began touring {{in the first half of}} 1987 with Marilyn Scharbaai (Carrilho) taking Liz Mitchell's place. Mitchell returned for a second leg of the tour late 1987, and Marcia Barrett soon left the band. At the same time, Bobby Farrell had set up a deal for a new Boney M. album to be recorded without Farian in Belgium. When Farrell failed to show up for either recording or tour, and Maizie Williams had never sung on record, the album ended up being released as Liz Mitchell's first solo album No One Will <b>Force</b> <b>You.</b> Mitchell and Williams completed a tour during 1987–88, adding singer Celena Duncan and Ron Gale as replacements for Barrett and Farrell. Carol Grey later replaced Celena Duncan and Curt De Daran later replaced Ron Gale.|$|E

500|$|David L.G. Arnold {{comments}} in the book Leaving Springfield that the episode is a satire on [...] "society's lazy, uninformed attitude about the electoral process", as well as [...] "a comment on the role in society of a cadre of elites (the Republican party) who see themselves as naturally suited to lead". The episode also portrays Republicans as willing {{to break the law}} in order to achieve this; in this case, Bob commits electoral fraud. This is most displayed in Bob's line: [...] "Your guilty conscience may <b>force</b> <b>you</b> to vote Democratic, but deep down inside you secretly long for a cold-hearted Republican to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king. That's why I did this: to protect you from yourselves." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} spent $4 {{million to}} restore Dealey Plaza to 1963 conditions. Stone utilized {{a variety of}} film stocks. Richardson said, [...] "It depends {{whether you want to}} shoot in 35 or 16 or Super 8. In many cases the lighting has to be different." [...] For certain shots in the film, Stone employed multiple camera crews shooting at once, using five cameras {{at the same time in}} different formats. Richardson said of Stone's style of direction, [...] "Oliver disdains convention, he tries to <b>force</b> <b>you</b> into things that are not classic. There's this constant need to stretch." [...] This forced the cinematographer to use lighting in diverse positions and rely very little on classic lighting modes. The shoot lasted 79 days with filming finished five months before the release date.|$|E

Sadly it falters with repeated level design and a moderately troublesome camera; but {{in the grand scheme}} of things, these are only minor flaws." [...] PSM3 gave the game an 80 out of 100. The magazine discussed the difficulty of the game, saying, [...] "Most games these days tend to hold your hand all the way through...Devil May Cry is not like that. It'll throw a million demons at you because it wants to, put in half a dozen arbitrary fights in a 30-foot stretch of map, <b>force</b> <b>you</b> to survive for ages on a tiny sliver of health... and then give you a D at the end of the level because you weren't doing enough combos." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's combat {{was praised}} by most critics. Electronic Gaming Monthlys Crispin Boyer {{described}} {{the game as}} [...] "a thrill ride. And not just 'cause Return of the King unleashes larger hordes of foes than last year's equally slick Two Towers prequel. Many of Return of the Kings levels actually <b>force</b> <b>you</b> to multitask while you hack and slash." [...] PC Gamer UKs Tony Ellis wrote [...] "combat in RotK is superbly satisfying. Your blows connect with a solid, visceral thud you can almost feel." [...] He also noted the variation between levels. Eurogamer's Kristan Reed praised the [...] "subtleties of the combat." [...] In contrast, Game Informers Matthew Kato found the gameplay to be [...] "repetitious", writing [...] "sometimes I got the feeling that I was working harder only to have less fun than in Two Towers." [...] The co-op mode was also praised.|$|E

Namrata Thakur of Rediff.com gave the film the highest praise and deemed it [...] "an absolute gem", saying [...] "there is hardly a dull moment in the film". She considered it the feel-good film of the year, comparing it to 2015's Dum Laga Ke Haisha. The Hindu journalist and film critic Namrata Joshi included Nil Battey Sannata in her year-end list of [...] "Hindi films that made a mark in 2016".

500|$|An {{observer}} in {{an accelerated}} reference frame must introduce what physicists call fictitious forces {{to account for}} the acceleration experienced by himself and objects around him. One example, the force pressing the driver of an accelerating car into his or her seat, has already been mentioned; another is the <b>force</b> <b>you</b> can feel pulling your arms up and out if you attempt to spin around like a top. [...] Einstein's master insight was that the constant, familiar pull of the Earth's gravitational field is fundamentally the same as these fictitious forces. [...] The apparent magnitude of the fictitious forces always appears to be proportional to the mass of any object on which they act – for instance, the driver's seat exerts just enough force to accelerate the driver {{at the same rate as}} the car. [...] By analogy, Einstein proposed that an object in a gravitational field should feel a gravitational force proportional to its mass, as embodied in Newton's law of gravitation.|$|E
500|$|Morrowind, {{following}} the tradition established by its predecessors in The Elder Scrolls series, is a free-form world, with few constricting boundaries on the player's actions. From {{the beginning of}} the game, players are put in a world where they are left to roam, steal, quest and explore, without necessarily {{following the}} main quest. Lead designer Ken Rolston, asked prior to Morrowinds release what he thought were the [...] "core, untouchable design elements" [...] of the Elder Scrolls series which [...] "set them apart from other games," [...] responded immediately: [...] "Free-form experience." [...] In Rolston's view, the game's central plot is a chance to introduce the player to a cross-current of conflicting factions, background themes, and to the characters of the game, rather than the primary focus of the player's experience. [...] "Every [...] game has to let you create the kind of character you want, and then do the things you want. We would never have a [...] <b>force</b> <b>you</b> to be a certain character or go down a certain path." ...|$|E
500|$|Evans {{retired as}} CAS on 30May 1985, having flown {{in excess of}} 8,600 hours during his RAAF career. [...] He was praised by his successor, Air Marshal Jake Newham, for his [...] "extraordinary zeal and robustness" [...] that helped instil [...] "a renewed sense of pride in the Service". In {{retirement}} Evans became a consultant on defence and aviation matters, and wrote and lectured extensively on air power. As a visiting fellow at the Australian National University's Strategic and Defence Studies Centre in 1986, he produced a working paper focussing on the RAAF's concept of operations, Air Operations in Northern Australia. The same year, he was publicly critical of the Federal government's Dibb Report, claiming that while it contained [...] "sensible policy for the defence of Australia", it did not recognise the ADF's offensive capabilities: [...] "People win wars by taking the initiative. In war the aim must be to win.... If you are a small <b>force</b> <b>you</b> cannot afford to wait, and otherwise you will be defeated." [...] Evans also stood for political office, running as the Liberal candidate for the seat of Eden-Monaro, New South Wales, in the 1987 Australian federal election. He was competing for the conservative vote with National candidate Peter Cochran, whose party advertising was considered to have outperformed the Liberals'. [...] The seat was retained by incumbent Labor member Jim Snow.|$|E

He explained to the Tampa Bay Times why people did not simply {{walk out of the}} Hole: [...] "If you leave you are going to lose contact with your family and any friends who are Scientologists. You have it pounded into you the whole time that the only reason someone leaves a group like that is because they are bad, that you have done something that <b>force</b> <b>you</b> to have to leave."

500|$|The Saturn {{version was}} noted as being mostly {{faithful}} to the PC original. Sam Hickman of Sega Saturn Magazine praised it for retaining the original intro, music, speech samples, and features of the PC version (all {{of which had been}} left out of most previous console versions), although a reviewer from the Japanese magazine of the same name criticised the lack of mouse support. Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewer held a similar opinion to that of Hickman by commending the Saturn version for being a comprehensive port of the PC original, and also applauded the addictive simulation gaming of Theme Park, calling it [...] "SimCity with a playful spirit". Mean Machines Sega reviewer compared it to the Mega Drive version, citing the save function and variety of entertainers as major improvements over that version. A Next Generation critic lauded the game's [...] "simple interface", [...] "infectious gameplay", and [...] "realistic business fundamentals", but felt the Saturn's [...] "near-perfect" [...] conversion of the PC original was commendable but unexciting, and expressed regret that there were no upgrades or additions. GamePro gave a terse joint review of the Saturn and PlayStation versions, commenting, [...] "you decide every detail, right down to the roller coaster's speed. Simple graphics and sounds offer up little treats to keep the game interesting. Overlapping menu systems <b>force</b> <b>you</b> to read the manual".|$|E
500|$|In Planet Simpson, author Chris Turner {{writes that}} Bob {{is built into}} a highbrow snob and {{conservative}} Republican so that the writers can continually use him as a strawman and pincushion. He represents high culture while Krusty represents low culture, and Bart, stuck in between, always wins out. In the book Leaving Springfield, David L. G. Arnold comments that Bart {{is a product of}} a [...] "mass-culture upbringing" [...] and thus is Bob's enemy. Frustrated by his early role as the target of [...] "Krusty's cheap gags", Bob frames Krusty and takes over the show. He changes the content of that show to present readings of classic literature and segments examining the emotional lives of pre-teens. He believes that by exposing the kids to high culture he will improve their lives. Arnold writes that [...] "Bob's own conscience and morality are clearly unaffected by the high culture he represents." [...] He also tries to [...] "manipulate the tastes of the masses" [...] by becoming a criminal mastermind. Arnold believes that this is most apparent in [...] "Sideshow Bob Roberts", wherein he rigs the election to become the mayor of Springfield. When accused of election fraud, he rants, [...] "Your guilty consciences may <b>force</b> <b>you</b> to vote Democratic, but secretly you yearn for a cold-hearted Republican who’ll cut taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! You need me, Springfield!" [...] He considers himself a member of the social elite, and happily uses Machiavellian methods to acquire and maintain power.|$|E

500|$|Super Smash Bros. for 3DS and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U both {{garnered}} critical {{praise and}} were commercially successful, holding current ratings of 85/100 and 92/100 on Metacritic and 86.10% and 92.39% on GameRankings. Reviewers have particularly noted the large, diverse character roster, the improvements to game mechanics, and {{the variety of}} multiplayer options. Some criticisms in the 3DS version include a lack of single player modes and issues concerning the 3DS hardware, such as the size of characters on the smaller screen when zoomed out and latency issues during both local and online multiplayer. There were also reports of players damaging their 3DS Circle Pads while playing the game excessively. [...] The Wii U version's online play quality was mildly criticized for some inconsistency, but has overall been critically acclaimed. Daniel Dischoff of Game Revolution stated [...] "It's true that Super Smash Bros. evolves every time with regard to new features, items, and characters to choose from. [...] While your favorite character may not return or a few annoying pickups may <b>force</b> <b>you</b> to turn off items altogether, this represents the biggest leap forward Smashers have seen yet." [...] Daniel Starky at GameSpot criticized the inconsistent online performance in the game, but still called it an [...] "incredible game", noting [...] "With the Wii U release, Smash Bros. has fully realized its goals." [...] Jose Otero from IGN, praising the replayability of the game, states [...] "Nearly every aspect of Smash Wii U seems fine-tuned not only {{to appeal to the}} nostalgia of long-time Nintendo fans, but also to be accessible to new players." ...|$|E

[...] Rare should be proud that its design is in the right hands. Or just insanely jealous. Either works." [...] Video game talk show Good Games two presenters gave the game a 9 and 8.5 out of 10, praising how true the music kept to {{the style of the}} original tracks, and that it managed to keep from becoming too complex while still avoiding being over-simplified, saying [...] "If you're a fan of the old Donkeys, or you just want a great platforming experience, this is worth {{at least as much as}} Kong's golden banana hoard." [...] X-Play praised the similarity of Returns to previous games in the series, the game's replay value, and its graphics, but the review criticized the motion controls [...] "that <b>force</b> <b>you</b> to react quickly at bad times, a button press would suffice" [...] and the co-op game play, saying, [...] "If your partner has a penchant for dying, look forward to some short games as he or she will most likely drain the number of lives you both share." [...] GamesRadar complimented the title for its standout levels and fan service, while criticizing it for levels that are [...] "frustrating, unclear and often misleading way that is unlike any prior Donkey Kong adventure", and motion controls that make them [...] "question the controls in a platformer".
