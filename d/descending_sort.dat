In this paper, we present an advanced highlight analysis system for sports video browsing, in which highlight evaluation and ranking are concerned besides highlight detection. First, we use replay detection to efficiently localize the highlights. Then incorporating with domain-specific knowledge, we adopt several significant cues to evaluate the importance degree of the highlights with support vector regression. Finally, the highlights are ranked with <b>descending</b> <b>sort</b> according to their importance value. The ranking results can provide a hierarchical video browsing and customized content delivery scheme.

40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} {{traditional}} Chinese medicine (TCM) {{diagnosis and treatment}} of type 2 diabetes in Tianjin urban population. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on hospital patients with type 2 diabetes in TCM hospitals of different levels in Tianjin from 2003 to 2007. The multiphasic stratified cluster sampling method was adopted in selecting the target hospital. Finally 3 496 patients were selected as the survey sample. Then the constituent ratios of diabetes in different syndrome types were calculated. Results: In this study, the <b>descending</b> <b>sort</b> proportion of TCM syndrome types of type 2 diabetes in Tianjin urban population was deficiency of both qi and yin, stagnation of phlegm-dampness, exuberant heat due to yin deficiency, deficiency of both yin and yang, and blood stasis and qi stagnation. Most of the diabetes patients with deficiency of both qi and yin, deficiency of both yin and yang, and stagnation of phlegm-dampness were older than 60 years. Most of the diabetes patients with exuberant heat due to yin deficiency were 50 to 59 years old, while the diabetes patients with blood stasis and qi stagnation were 40 to 49 years old. The frequency of Danggui (Angelica sinensis) use was high in the diabetes patients with deficiency of both qi and yin; the frequency of Chenpi (Citrus reticulate Blanco) use was high in the diabetes patients with exuberant heat due to yin deficiency; the frequency of Baishao (Radix Paeoniae Alba) use was high in the diabetes patients with deficiency of both qi and yin; the frequency of Gancao (Radix Glycyrrhizae) use was high in the diabetes patients with stagnation of phlegm-dampness; and the frequency of Xingren (Semen Armeniacae) use was high in the diabetes patients with blood stasis and qi stagnation. Conclusion: The main syndrome types of diabetes patients in Tianjin urban area are deficiency of both qi and yin, stagnation of phlegm-dampness and exuberant heat due to yin deficiency. And the patients are mainly older than 50 years. The most frequently used herbs are Danggui (Angelica sinensis), Chenpi (Citrus reticulate Blanco), Baishao (Radix Paeoniae Alba), Gancao (Radix Glycyrrhizae) and Xingren (Semen Armeniacae) ...|$|E

Arctic sea ice image has been documented by remotely sensed data since the 1970 s. By examining these data, some climate patterns can be revealed. In this research, Arctic region is divided into 9 sections to analyze the regional differences of the ice coverage and variability. Data used are bootstrapped 1979 to 2006 SSM/I and SMMR images from NSIDC to perform a time series analysis to examine the sea ice trends and spatial/temporal anomalies detection by conducting a <b>descending</b> <b>sort</b> of sea ice coverage by years in the sub-regional scale. Then, the temporal mixture analysis developed by Piwowar & LeDrew is applied to the data to reveal the variability within each subregion. Fractional images produced by TMA highlight the temporal signature concentration in the entire Arctic region. And the color-mix image derived from TMA highlights and overlaps temporal signatures that have over 80 % concentrations from highest to lowest. The color mix image can reveal the spatial distribution of similar temporal characteristics and the evolution of time series in the same area during the 30 -year period. Through this analysis, the spatial and temporal variability of Arctic sea ice can be perceived that in the subpolar regions, Arctic sea ice has a higher seasonal pattern which varies a lot each other. The Arctic sea ice extent endures an overall decline trend, which the decline speed increases every ten years. But this trend is not statistically significant in every subregion. The spatial/temporal anomaly analysis reveals several patterns of Arctic sea ice variability. The seasonal variability of Arctic sea ice in the eastern and western side of the Arctic Basin resemble each other in the long term, which may coincide with the North Atlantic Oscillation. In addition, within a subregion, different areas may have significantly different temporal characteristics, such as the Greenland Sea and Seas of Okhotsk. Moreover, the temporal characteristics some areas in the Arctic region have changed through time significantly regarding early melt or late freeze. Hopefully this analysis will provide undiscovered temporal evolution through time and some new insights on the dynamics of the Arctic sea ice cover...|$|E

The contribution value C {{was defined as the}} percentage of the R value of a specific factor to the total R values of all the factors. A factor with larger R would have more influence on torque converter performance indicators, and was considered as an important factor during converter design. While factors with small range value R would be considered as less important factors during design procedure. It could be found in Table  4 that, parameters turbine outlet angle β_T 2 and stator outlet angle β_S 2 are the two most important factors. To be more precise, the <b>descending</b> <b>sort</b> of range R is β_T 2 > β_S 2 > β_T 1 > β_S 1 > β_I 2 > β_I 1 for stall torque ratio, and β_T 2 > β_S 2 > β_T 1 > β_I 2 > β_I 1 > β_S 1 for peak efficiency. Therefore, more focuses are needed on the optimization of turbine outlet angle and stator outlet angle in the design phase, in order to achieve better performance of the flat torque converter. It {{should be noted that the}} results may have some difference with the conclusions studied before. This is possible caused by the level selection of design parameters.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the use of political power by selected superintendents in northern Illinois. The population consisted of 750 superintendents. The study sample consisted of seven recommended superintendents. Qualitative research methods were used in this study. The researcher employed a grounded theory method to derive a general, abstract theory of a process, action, or interaction grounded in the participants' views. This involved using multiple stages of data collection and the refinement and interrelationship of the defined categories of information. The initial or emerging theory was always tested against the data that was systematically collected through a constant comparative method. The qualitative interview method was used to explore the use of power in political situations to resolve conflict. The primary data collection technique used by this researcher was interviewing with an interview guide. This researcher conducted a content analysis of each participant's response. This involved an initial reading of the transcribed interviews. Color codes were assigned to each emerging category. The superintendent's responses were analyzed to determine patterns and themes. Based on the exploratory factor analysis of the first interview, 31 components or underlying factors were identified. These 31 factors accounted for 91. 1 % of the analysis of the variance. Based on the exploratory factor analysis of the second interview, 47 components or underlying factors were identified. These 47 factors accounted for 87. 7 % of the analysis of the variance. A binomial analysis was computed to determine which are the significant variables or themes that emerged from the coded responses, based on the frequency of the response. The variables were listed in <b>descending</b> <b>sort</b> order by frequency of response. Eighteen issues were found to be statistically significant in the first interview. In the second interview, 16 issues were found to be statistically significant. The data analysis of this study revealed the theme of the superintendent as politician and ethical leader. Included within the role of politician were three major patterns, which were negotiator, effective communicator, and information expert. Superintendents operate in political arenas, where power dominates many of their decisions. Superintendents must develop the skills necessary to operate successfully in this political arena. They must learn to balance the forces of power and politics, making decisions and resolving conflicts in the best interest of students and the school district. Politics and conflict are inevitable in the superintendency. Power has become the key resource in resolving conflict. The result of this study indicated recommendations that include the need for educational administration programs to provide instruction in the use of political strategies, negotiating skills, effective communication, and ethical training...|$|E

An analogy is that {{a deck of cards}} is ordered within the pack, but before a game of poker or solitaire the deck is shuffled to create a random permutation. Shuffling is used to assure that an aggregate of data elements for a sequence S is randomly arranged, but avoids an ordered or partially ordered permutation. Shuffling is the process of arranging data elements into a random permutation. The sequence S as an aggregation of N data elements, there are N! possible permutations. For the large number of possible permutations, two of the possible permutations are for a sorted or ordered placement of data elements [...] both an ascending and <b>descending</b> <b>sorted</b> permutation. Shuffling must avoid inadvertently creating either an ascending or descending permutation. Shuffling is frequently coupled to another algorithmic function [...] pseudo-random number generation. The efficiency and quality of the shuffle is directly dependent upon the random number generation algorithm utilized. A more effective and efficient method of shuffling is to use parameterization to configure the shuffle, and to shuffle into sub-arrays by utilizing the encoding of the data elements. The binar shuffle algorithm uses the encoding of the data elements and parameterization to avoid any direct coupling to a random number generation algorithm, but still remain a linear O(N) shuffle algorithm.

40|$|Abstract Background Large {{biological}} data sets, such as expression profiles, {{benefit from}} reduction of random noise. Principal component (PC) analysis {{has been used}} for this purpose, but it tends to remove small features as well as random noise. Results We interpreted the PCs as a mere signal-rich coordinate system and sorted the squared PC-coordinates of each row in <b>descending</b> order. The <b>sorted</b> squared PC-coordinates were compared with the distribution of the ordered squared random noise, and PC-coordinates for insignificant contributions were treated as random noise and nullified. The processed data were transformed back to the initial coordinates as noise-reduced data. To increase the sensitivity of signal capture and reduce the effects of stochastic noise, this procedure was applied to multiple small subsets of rows randomly sampled from a large data set, and the results corresponding to each row of the data set from multiple subsets were averaged. We call this procedure Row-specific, Sorted PRincipal component-guided Noise Reduction (RSPR-NR). Robust performance of RSPR-NR, measured by noise reduction and retention of small features, was demonstrated using simulated data sets. Furthermore, when applied to an actual expression profile data set, RSPR-NR preferentially increased the correlations between genes that share the same Gene Ontology terms, strongly suggesting reduction of random noise in the data set. Conclusion RSPR-NR is a robust random noise reduction method that retains small features well. It should be useful in improving the quality of large biological data sets. </p...|$|R

Maintenance management can significantly affect the efficiency of a company – particularly in terms of allocating resources. Analysis, as the cornerstone of business decision making and using modern approaches and technologies, has progressed substantially. Using modern approaches, such as data mining, we can discover the relationship between data and find patterns in them. Root-cause analysis (RCA) is a reactive method used for finding the real cause of failure. We use RCA when failure has already occurred. The method uses different creative and structured approaches. Fault tree analysis is a proactive method, consisting of event and logical gates that present the relationship between events. We analyse the fault tree using the rules of Boolean logic. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the fault tree give important information about the probability of the events or the reliability of the component. The second proactive method presented is Failure Mode and Effect Analysis, which is based on a list of possible failures. For each failure, we calculate the risk priority number. The list of failures, <b>sorted</b> <b>descending</b> by RPN, is an indicator of the importance of each failure. In the last section, we present a prototype application for failure analysis.

This is a product expectedly familiar to many who live in the Rochester area, particularly for Roman Catholics who likely feel good about supporting their local monastic community when purchasing the delicious baked-goods.

So as not to be dependent upon secular society the Cistercians became self-sustaining communities who each carved out for themselves some sort of niche in the local economic landscape. The practice of relying upon benefices, tithes, rents and tolls was initially rejected by medieval Cistercians.

The backscattered echoes from the foliage, woody vegetation, the terrain, and other objects are detected, leading to a cloud of points. Higher echo densities (> 20 echoes/m 2) and additional classification variables from full-waveform (FWF) ALS data, namely echo amplitude, echo width and information on multiple echoes from one shot, offer new possibilities in classifying the ALS point cloud. Currently FWF sensor information is hardly used for classification purposes. This contribution presents an object-based point cloud analysis (OBPA) approach, combining segmentation and classification of the 3 D FWF ALS points designed to detect tall vegetation in urban environments. The definition tall vegetation includes trees and shrubs, but excludes grassland and herbage. In the applied procedure FWF ALS echoes are segmented by a seeded region growing procedure. All echoes <b>sorted</b> <b>descending</b> by their surface roughness are used as seed points. Segments are grown based on echo width homogeneity. Next, segment statistics (mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation) are calculated by aggregating echo features such as amplitude and surface roughness. For classification a rule base is derived automatically from a training area using a statistical classification tree. To demonstrate our method we present data of three sites with around 500, 000 echoes each. The accuracy of the classified vegetation segments is evaluated for two independent validation sites. In a point-wise error assessment, where the classification is compared with manually classified 3 D points, completeness and correctness better than 90 % are reached for the validation sites. In comparison to many other algorithms the proposed 3 D point classification works on the original measurements directly, i. e. the acquired points. Gridding of the data is not necessary, a process which is inherently coupled to loss of data and precision. The 3 D properties provide especially a good separability of buildings and terrain points respectively, if they are occluded by vegetation...|$|R
