5|$|Double hulls {{have become}} popular <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>ten</b> years. Designing a vessel with double sides adds {{primarily}} to its breadth, since bulkers are already {{required to have}} double bottoms. One {{of the advantages of}} the double hull is to make room to place all the structural elements in the sides, removing them from the holds. This increases the volume of the holds, and simplifies their structure which helps in loading, unloading, and cleaning. Double sides also improve a ship's capacity for ballasting, which is useful when carrying light goods: the ship may have to increase its draft for stability or seakeeping reasons, which is done by adding ballast water.|$|E

5|$|Construction was {{slated for}} the {{interchange}} with County Routes 516 and 527 in Old Bridge {{as there is}} no way to access either of them without driving through a residential area off Route 18. The traffic flow along CR 516 (Old Bridge into Matawan) and 527 (Old Bridge into Englishtown/Manalapan) has increased significantly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>ten</b> years which called for the exit ramp off Route 18. The Old Bridge improvements include adding inside shoulders and widening County Routes 516 and 527. A signalized ramp is to be added for access to County Routes 516 and 527. Subsequently, County Route 516's intersection with Old Matawan Road is to be relocated. The project would cost over $28 million and was slated to begin in 2009 and to end in 2010. As of the end of 2009 the large project was put on hold because of the lack of funds and the economic situation. Demolition was completed in 2009 on Marlboro Road, taking down several residential houses and along Old Matawan Road and CR 516 and taking down an old gas station in preparing for the project.

25|$|The first mutiny {{occurred}} in 1573, with the soldiers ultimately being paid off with 60 florins each, two further mutinies followed, freezing {{the progress of}} the Spanish campaign. Mutinies continued in 1575 and 1576, up until the death of the Army's commander, Requesens. The Army effectively collapsed, sustaining itself by extorting money and food from the local peoples â widespread fresh Dutch revolts recommenced, accompanied by a general outcry of 'death to the Spaniards'. The new commander in the Netherlands, Don John of Austria was unable to restore order, resulting in the Sack of Antwerp, a horrific event in which 1,000 houses were destroyed and 8,000 people killed by rampaging soldiers. The States General, influenced by the sack, signed the Pacification of Ghent only four days later, unifying the rebellious provinces and the loyal provinces with the goal of removing all Spanish soldiers from the Netherlands, as well as stopping the persecution of heretics. This effectively destroyed every accomplishment the Spanish had made <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>ten</b> years.

500|$|A {{day after}} the Dade County repeal, State Assemblyman Art Agnos, who {{represented}} portions of San Francisco with a very high population of gays and lesbians, decided not to submit a gay civil rights bill to the state legislature, reasoning {{that it no longer}} had any support. California state senator John Briggs, from Fullerton was in the crowd with Anita Bryant the night she and Save Our Children won the Dade County vote. Greatly impressed by the voter turnout, Briggs had designs to win the race for governor of California for 1978. When he returned from Miami, since there was no gay rights law to overturn, he proposed a law to forbid employing openly gay public school teachers and other workers. The bill, Proposition 6ânicknamed the Briggs Initiativeâwas written so broadly that it also allowed the dismissal of any public school employee for supporting gay rights including voting against Proposition 6, regardless of their sexual orientation. He stated, [...] "What I am after is to remove those homosexual teachers who through word, thought or deed want to be a public homosexual, to entice young impressionable children into their lifestyle". Briggs announced the proposition on the steps of San Francisco City Hall, after notifying several local gay organizations of his intentions.
