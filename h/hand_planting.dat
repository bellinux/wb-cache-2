50|$|A large {{block of}} upland forest is taking {{shape in the}} {{northeast}} portion of the Lower Arboretum, and eventually there will be about 180 acres (73 hectares) of contiguous forest in that area alone. There will be an additional area of at least 50 acres (20 hectares) of upland forest in {{the southeast corner of}} the Upper Arboretum. Some of these forests will grow by means of natural colonization of abandoned agricultural fields by trees. However, the forest-building process can be significantly accelerated by <b>hand</b> <b>planting</b> of tree seedlings, and this is being done in select areas. Only offspring of trees from the local area are planted in the Arboretum, to maintain genetic similarity to nearby forests. In the Upper Arboretum, forest planting has been concentrated in the Alumni Field (H3-4, I3-4). This field was removed from agriculture in 1986, and trees have been planted here over several years starting in 1990. Alumni volunteers have done substantial amounts of the tree planting here. Many thousands of trees have been planted in old fields in the Lower Arboretum as well.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{determine}} if the Oregon State Forestry Department's stocking survey system can be applied to planted acres as well as to seeded acres. Two computer programs were developed into a primary program. One produced a new stocking curve adapted to <b>hand</b> <b>planting</b> patterns, and the other determined the stocking from this and a natural reforestation curve in relation to sampling data. Also developed was a three-plot sequential technique to modify any one sampling point. Answers include total number of trees per acre, separated into naturally seeded and planted trees, projecting the answer on a line basis, a 40 -acre basis and a project basis. Results of the study showed that: a) erroneous estimates of trees per acre in forest plantations may result from application of the present survey system; b) the proposed survey system has certain advantages over the present system in determining the degree of success in forest plantations; c) by recognizing spacing interval, the proposed survey system brings accuracy to the level necessary to meet present-day planning requirements; d) the proposed survey system will permit construction of sufficiently detailed mapping of voids due to mortality which may occur in forest plantations to develop reforestation plans; e) the proposed survey system will tend to estimate more correctly, where the present system tends to underestimate the number of surviving trees per acre in plantations having a high mortality rate; f) the proposed system permits using fixed radius plots, the radius of which is related to plantation spacing...|$|E

This paper developed a tree planting system. We transformed a real world’s terrain geometrical model into a water-ink styled painting, and rendered the plant communities in the terrain as well. This work also allowed users to navigate the 3 D landscape freely. We rendered terrain’s silhouettes in according with viewpoint and adapt “suggestive contour” technique [8] to enhance drawing style in order to generate better water-ink landscape paintings. The characteristics of plant communities in real world’s ecosystems, such as clustering and competition, were emulated in this work. Tree’s edge lines were drawn with varying widths and intensities based on the contours of those edge lines. Methods of convolution surface and cloud shape were applied to generate foliage. We allowed users to have some degrees of interactive control over the plant communities such as the <b>hand</b> <b>planting</b> trees, the tree species selecting, and the multiple fog deployments…etc. A Chinese water-ink landscape painting doesn’t interest in the realistic rendering. Nevertheless, it much more focuses on artistic inner-mind and esthetic expression using hairy brush stroke and ink dispersion.

Soils at the field site are classified as Vertisols (containing 51 % clay, 27.5 % sand and 21.5 % silt) with an alkaline pH (7.7 – 8.3) and an OC content of 0.5 – 0.6 %. The mineral content of the top 15  cm rhizosphere soil include, 24  mg kg− 1 soil of available N, 9  mg kg− 1 soil of available P and 290  mg kg− 1 soil of available K.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. Improving the use {{of cover}} crops, such as Crotalaria juncea and Tagates patula, is needed for {{management}} of plant-parasitic and free-living nematodes. These cover crops might improve soil health conditions through a strip-till cover cropping practice. The integration of cover cropping of C. juncea and soil solarization could further improve ecological-based nematode management more than C. juncea alone. Additional improvement could be achieved if T. patula or C. juncea are found to suppress Meloidogyne incognita or Rotylenchulus reniformis more efficiently when these nematodes are in a vulnerable state. Strip-till cover cropping (STCC) of C. juncea suppressed M. incognita, but T. patula only suppressed M. incognita when planted immediately following after a susceptible host. In addition, STCC of C. juncea also enhanced population densities of bacterivorous and fungivorous nematodes, whereas STCC of T. patula enhanced these free-living nematodes inconsistently. Integration of C. juncea cover cropping and soil solarization did not reduce R. reniformis opulation densities, but reduced weed coverage as compared to C. juncea alone. The benefits of integrating C. juncea to soil solarization were only observed where C. juncea biomass was high (3. 6 Mt/ha). Leachate of T. patula did not suppress egg hatch and J 2 activity of M. incognita. However, planting of T. patula in a greenhouse pot experiment suppressed M. incognita J 2 activity if the soil was conditioned with irrigation or cucumber leachate but not with dry treatment. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>planting</b> of C. juncea and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) {{reduced the number of}} R. reniformis in anhydrobiotic state. Amending soil with C. juncea suppressed R. reniformis more efficiently if fewer anhydrobiotic R. reniformis were present. In conclusion, C. juncea outperformed T. patula in a STCC system, whereas integration of C. juncea with soil solarization did not improve the benefit of a cover crop, C. juncea. Based on the greenhouse studies, the nematode suppressive effect of T. patula could be improved by planting T. patula immediately after a susceptible host. Benefits of C. juncea amendment were more obvious if used immediately after nematode susceptible (poor or good) hosts...|$|E
40|$|In rice-based lowland {{areas in}} the Mekong region, the lack of full {{irrigation}} water availability for post-rice legume crops and the poor soil physical and chemical conditions are major constraints for development of sound rice/legume double cropping system. In order to improve legume productivity, use of rice straw mulch and various crop establishment methods were examined in two series of mungbean experiments in Cambodia where soils were coarse and strongly compacted. In one set of experiments conducted at four locations in the ﬁrst year the effect of straw mulch, planting method (manual vs seed drill) and tillage method (conventional vs no-till) was examined. Another set of experiments were conducted {{in the second year}} at three locations with four levels of mulch under two planting densities. On average in year 1, mulching of rice straw at 1. 5 t/ha increased mungbean crop establishment from 72 to 83 %, reduced weed biomass from 164 to 123 kg/ha and increased yield from 228 to 332 kg/ha. Mulch was effective in conserving soil moisture, and even at maturity the mulched area had on average 1 % higher soil moisture content. The amount of mulch between 1 and 2 t/ha did not show consistent effects in year 2, partly because some mulch treatments resulted in excessive soil moisture content and were not effective. Rice straw mulch had a signiﬁcant effect on mungbean yield in 6 out of the 7 experiments conducted in two years, and mean yield increase was 35 %. This yield advantage was attributed to better crop establishment, improved growth and reduced weed pressure, but in some cases only one or two of these factors were effective. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>planting</b> method, tillage method and planting density had only small effects on mungbean yield in most experiments. Only in one location out of four tested, the no-till treatment produced signiﬁcantly higher yield than the conventional method. Seed drill produced similar mungbean establishment and grain yield to the manual planting suggesting that the planter can be used to save the labour cost which is increasing rapidly in the Mekong region.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Pleuropogon oregonus Chase {{is a rare}} wetland grass {{endemic to}} eastern Oregon. The species is {{composed}} of two widely separated populations, one in Lake County and one in Union County. In {{order to reduce the}} risk of extinction, the Oregon Department of Agriculture Native Plant Conservation Program initiated several reintroduction projects for the species in the early 2000 s. Because there were some morphological distinctions (implying genetic differences) between the two population groups, plants from the different counties were considered to represent separate conservation units in reintroduction projects. The Union County ecotype established well at a site in Grant County (Logan Valley), but reintroduction attempts with the Lake County ecotype failed to produce self-perpetuating populations. This brings up the question of whether successful establishment is related to habitat quality at the reintroduction sites, the ecotype used, or some combination of both. In addition, the small natural patch sizes, mostly clonal growth, and low caryopsis production suggests that Oregon semaphore grass might suffer from low genetic diversity and inbreeding depression. Therefore, the question of whether separate ecotypes should be mixed in reintroduction projects merits consideration. On the one <b>hand,</b> <b>planting</b> allopatric ecotypes together runs the risk of disrupting co-adapted gene complexes. Yet if material used in reintroductions exhibits inbreeding depression, mixing disparate populations may be advantageous. Because environmental conditions often fluctuate in wetlands, vegetative community characteristics may be useful in measuring suitability. Ecotypes were reintroduced in separate areas and mixed in one area at the same reintroduction site, i. e., End Creek, in Union County. Although an effort was made to reintroduce ecotypes into areas that were similar, in terms of environmental conditions and vegetative communities, there were landscape-wide differences in the outplanting areas that were not measured in this study, such as changes in hydrology. Because the area in which the mixed ecotypes were reintroduced did not have any surviving plants, the question of whether mixing ecotypes promoted caryopsis production could not be answered. The areas with the most survival were in full sun, completely saturated soil and had vegetative communities similar to the source sites. Although more plants at End Creek survived in the Union County area than the Lake County area, this difference was attributed to the inadvertent selection of presumably better quality habitat in this area. High quality habitat appears to be the most significant factor affecting reintroduction success. Although reintroduction areas may appear to be suitable on a small scale, the effect of the surrounding landscape may affect establishment in ways that are not predictable on a small scale. This was most apparent in the mixed plot area which seemed appropriate on the small scale, but contained no surviving plants upon monitoring...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} three {{aspects of the}} life history of Swamp Paperbark (Melaleuca ericifolia Sm.) that have implications for the ecology, management and restoration of wetlands occupied by the species: i) seed germination responses and tolerances; ii) clonal growth characteristics; and iii) safe sites for recruitment. Laboratory studies included the responses and tolerances of seed to three key environmental factors: light; temperature; salinity; and the potential interactions they may have on germination. Germination percentages were used as indicators of success. Darkness, moderate temperatures (~ 200 C) and low salinity levels (< 2 gL- 1) {{were found to be}} the most ideal germination conditions. Additional studies were carried out on secondary structures, hypocotyl hairs, which were shown to influence establishment success of seedlings. The conditions found ideal for germination proved to be suitable for hypocotyl hair formation. Field and laboratory studies were carried out to determine the allocation of resources to reproductive effort and seed production in M. ericifolia. Comparative studies were carried out between two sympatric Melaleuca species with contrasting life histories and reproductive strategies (clonal vs. non-clonal) to determine if there were differences in reproductive capacity and commitment of resources to either sexual or asexual reproductive effort. There was low germinability of the clonal species M. ericifolia (< 40 %) when compared to the non-clonal M. parvistaminea (< 70 %). Germinability of M. ericifolia was reduced as population size decreased and distance to nearest population and degree of disturbance increased. Laboratory and field studies were undertaken to investigate the growth characteristics and ecological significance of the clonal growth form. Genetic methods were used to determine the genetic diversity and clonal intermingling in existing populations. Individual genets were found to contain thousands of stems and cover areas greater than 3, 000 m 2. Intermingling of the genets was not found. Air-photograph interpretation and structural analysis of individual clones were used to determine colonisation rates, longevity and time since recruitment. Lateral growth rates were generally found to be rapid, up to 0. 5 m per year. The largest plants found (3, 274 m 2), were determined to be approximately 52 years old. Safe sites for germination and recruitment were determined using historical aerial photographs and climate data combined with on-ground confirmation and characterisation of conditions. Microtopographical relief provided by hummocks within the wetland provided suitable safe sites for recruitment by modifying light, salinity and moisture levels to a range suitable for germination and hypocotyl hair production. Recruitment was however, restricted to a limited range of climatic conditions that diluted salinity levels but did not inundate newly germinated seedlings: flood conditions in spring followed by average rainfall in summer. Recommendations for landscape-scale rehabilitation of wetlands using M. ericifolia were formulated. The implications of {{the findings of this study}} on current ecological restoration theory and practice are discussed. Germination from seed in the highly modified conditions found in many wetlands in South-eastern Australia is problematic due to the specific climatic and on-ground conditions needed for successful recruitment. The findings of the growth and genetic studies of M. ericifolia indicate that planting of nursery grown stock is possible and even preferable if the growth characteristics of the plant are taken into consideration. Present planting methods used for non-clonal terrestrial species, <b>hand</b> <b>planting</b> large numbers of seedlings at close spacings, is inappropriate for M. ericifolia. A planting method that carefully selects planting sites, uses smaller numbers of plants and factors in clonality and lateral growth rates (time) would reduce restoration costs and improve long-term survival of planted stock...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Sugarcane, a plant which {{sugar is}} {{extracted}} from, is planted in vast areas with {{hot and humid}} climate. Brazil is the largest producer of sugarcane in the world. The next five major producers, in decreasing order, are India, China, Thailand, Pakistan and Mexico. Sugarcane is a tropical, perennial grass that forms lateral shoots at the base to produce multiple stems, typically three to four meters high and about 5 cm in diameter. The total area under sugarcane plantation in Iran (Khozestan Province) is about 80, 000 hectares with an average yield of 100 tons per hectare. To increase the yield per unit of land and reduce production costs and move toward sustainable agriculture, mechanization of agricultural operations seems inevitable. Planters {{are the most important}} of farm machinery among the mechanization equipment. Sugarcane cultivation is done both by hand and machine. <b>Hand</b> <b>planting</b> operations is laborious and painstaking work and work efficiency is so low and culture costs are so high. In Iran farms, the sugarcane plantation process is carried out manually by the farmers. Considering the climatic conditions, the agricultural soil composition and constitution, and the different plantation pattern used in Iran, the imported planting machines are not suitable for the farming conditions in the country. Moreover, the domestically produced machines, which are mostly based on the imported versions, do not provide adequate performance. Therefore, fabrication of a machine, capable of continuously lifting the sugarcane scions from a container and sending them to a dropper pipe, uniformly and in conformance with the climatic conditions of the sugarcane farms in the country, is of great importance. Materials and Methods In this research, initially, a field study was carried out to identify the problems and shortcomings of imported and copied planting machines in sugarcane farms, such as jamming of the scions conveying mechanism and the existence of unplanted sections in the farm. Subsequently, a new compound seeding unit with unique capabilities for solving the above mentioned problems was fabricated, with the aim of application in sugarcane planting machines. The various components of the system include: 1 - Tank split in two pieces and connected to each other by two hinges through the middle and it can adjust to different angles. 2 - Tube fall for cuttings scions. 3 - Two rows of chain on a conveyor screwed on belt. 4 - Number of 9 cups (channels) to receive and transmit cutting scions from the tank and guided them to the falls duct. 5 - 18 pcs of metal preservative, the chain screwed to conveyor. 6 - Four Number of gears on two shafts in order to drive the conveyor chain. 7 - Two shafts, one on top and one another {{on the bottom of the}} anchor-conveyors chain. 8 - The mechanism of driven Endless belt as a mobile bed to showing the steady rate of falling the scions from the fallen channel. 9 - Two variable speeds electromotor to provide the movement of complex distributer and planter’s mobile bed belt. 10 - Controlling mechanism of falling number of scion. After preparing and manufacturing the different machine’s pieces, they were installed on the chassis and then different units were prepared and the machine are run. Results and Discussion Therefore, fabrication of a mechanism, capable of continuously lifting the sugarcane scions from a container and sending them to a dropper pipe, uniformly and in conformance with the conditions of the sugarcane farms is of great importance. In the new mechanism, as opposed to the existing seeding units in which the seeding operation is performed lengthwise, planting of the scions is performed in a widthwise pattern. Using the manufactured machine had a great effect on method of tillage and planting. The farm field was changed to a smooth surface in tillage then in planting the scions with installing the two diagonal plate the soil putted on scions and the made furrows for irrigating. Conclusions This mechanism reduces the number of planted scions per hectare, results in a more uniform planting and growth of the scions, and reduces the number of machine trips in the farm, increasing the planter productivity. The seeding unit was fabricated and is presently ready for use in the sugarcane planters...|$|E
