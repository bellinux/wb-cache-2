In addition, modeling has provided many insights into ion-sample interactions and the resultant effects on the sample. With the knowledge gained, the community has found new ion-beam induced chemistries and ion-beam sources, allowing extending nanostructure fabrication and material deposition to smaller dimensions and better control for direct write and patterning. Insignificant proximity effects in resist-based ion beam lithography, combined with the availability of sub-nm <b>ion</b> <b>spot</b> sizes, opens the way to sub- 10 nm structures and dense patterns. Additionally, direct-write ion beam nanomachining can process multilevel structures with arbitrary depths in one single process step, with all the information included in a single standard design file, thus enabling fabrication applications not achievable with any other technique. © 2014 Materials Research Society...|$|E
40|$|Using Lorentz {{transmission}} {{electron microscopy}} we investigate the behavior of domain walls pinned at non-topographic defects in Cr(3 nm) /Permalloy(10 nm) /Cr(5 nm) nanowires of width 500 nm. The pinning sites consist of linear defects where magnetic properties are modified by a Ga ion probe with diameter ~ 10 nm using a focused ion beam microscope. We study the detailed change of the modified region (which is {{on the scale of}} the focused <b>ion</b> <b>spot)</b> using electron energy loss spectroscopy and differential phase contrast imaging on an aberration (Cs) corrected scanning transmission electron microscope. The signal variation observed indicates that the region modified by the irradiation corresponds to ~ 40 - 50 nm despite the ion probe size of only 10 nm. Employing the Fresnel mode of Lorentz {{transmission electron microscopy}}, we show {{that it is possible to}} control the domain wall structure and its depinning strength not only via the irradiation dose but also the line orientation.

40|$|Biological tissue imaging by {{secondary}} ion mass spectrometry has seen rapid development with the commercial availability of polyatomic primary ion sources. Endogenous lipids {{and other small}} bio-molecules can now be routinely mapped on the sub-micrometer scale. Such experiments are typically performed on time-of-flight mass spectrometers for high sensitivity and high repetition rate imaging. However, such mass analyzers lack the mass resolving power to ensure separation of isobaric ions and the mass accuracy for elemental formula assignment based on exact mass measurement.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{construction}} and performance of a novel photoelectron-photoion coincidence machine in our laboratory in Amsterdam to measure the full three-dimensional momentum distribution of correlated electrons and ions in femtosecond time-resolved molecular beam experiments. We implemented sets of open electron and ion lenses to time stretch and velocity map the charged particles. Time switched voltages are operated on the particle lenses to enable optimal electric field strengths for velocity map focusing conditions of electrons and ions separately. The position and time sensitive detectors employ microchannel plates (MCPs) in front of delay line detectors. A special {{effort was made to}} obtain the time-of-flight (TOF) of the electrons at high temporal resolution using small pore (5 μm) MCPs and implementing fast timing electronics. We measured the TOF distribution of the electrons under our typical coincidence field strengths with a temporal resolution down to σ= 18 ps. We observed that our electron coincidence detector has a timing resolution better than σ= 16 ps, which is mainly determined by the residual transit time spread of the MCPs. The typical electron energy resolution appears to be nearly laser bandwidth limited with a relative resolution of Δ EFWHM E= 3. 5 % for electrons with kinetic energy near 2 eV. The mass resolution of the ion detector for ions measured in coincidence with electrons is about Δ mFWHM m= 14150.

40|$|This is {{a general}} review of {{anomalous}} resistivity with emphasis on its applicability in space and more specifically on ionospheric plasmas. It is addressed to the general ionospheric community rather than the specialist. Therefore {{a substantial amount of}} rigor has been sacrificed in favor of simplified physical pictures. However, several prescriptions are presented, on the basis of which one can compute the anomalous resistivity resulting from each specific mechanism. Following a conceptual discussion of resistivity a general formalism is presented for its computation {{on the basis of the}} spectrum of electric field fluctuations. On the basis of this it is shown that stable nonthermal plasmas can at most enhance resistivity by a few percent. The same is true for collisionally driven instabilities. From the current-driven instabilities, only the ion acoustic instability can produce a steady state anomalous resistivity. The rest result in transient resistivity and the appearance of hot electron or <b>ion</b> <b>spots.</b> A more satisfying picture emerges when the low-frequency turbulence that produces resistivity is excited parametrically by a high-frequency instability. The case where such a driver arises from the interaction of precipitating electrons is discussed in detail. Finally, the relevance of the various resistivity mechanisms and their importance in ionospheric electron acceleration is discussed.

In contrast to the dwell time algorithm in the conventional IBF, the variable-spot IBF adopts a new algorithm, which consists of the scan path programming and the trajectory optimization using pattern search. In this algorithm, instead of the dwell time, a new concept, integral etching time, is proposed to interpret the process of variable-spot IBF.

40|$|In a multi-electrode device, {{the motion}} of free charge {{carriers}} generated by ionizing radiation induces currents on all the electrodes surrounding the active region [1]. The amount of charge induced in each sensitive electrode {{is a function of}} the device geometry, the transport parameters and the generation profile. Hence this charge sharing effect allows the signal from each sensitive electrode to provide information about the electrical characteristics of the device, as well as information on the location and the profile of each ionization track. The effectiveness of such approach was recently demonstrated in Ion Beam Induced Charge (IBIC) experiments carried out using a 2 MeV He microbeam scanning over a sub- 100 lm scale silicon device, where the ion strike location point was evaluated through a comparative analysis of the charge induced in two independent surface electrodes coupled to independent data acquisition systems [2].

The U-Pb ages coincide closely with Ar- 40 /Ar- 39 age spectrum plateau and ''terminal'' ages from coexisting K-feldspars and with the eruption ages of overlying volcanic rocks.

Interpretation of the feldspar Ar- 40 /Ar- 39 age data using multi-diffusion domain theory indicates that post-emplacement rapid cooling was succeeded either by slower cooling from 350 - 300 C between 1. 0 and 0. 4 Ma or transitory reheating to 300 - 350 C at about 0. 4 - 0. 6 Ma.

40|$|Abstract—Investigation {{of modern}} and fossil teeth from {{northern}} and central Kenya, using the ion micro-probe, electron microprobe, and transmission electron microscope, confirms that fossil tooth chemistry is controlled {{not only by}} the diagenetic precipitation of secondary minerals but also by the chemical alteration of the biogenic apatite. Increases in the concentrations of Fe, Mn, Si, Al, Ba, and possibly Cu in fossil vs. modern teeth reflect mixtures of apatite and secondary minerals. These secondary minerals occur in concen-trations ranging from; 0. 3 % in enamel to; 5 % in dentine and include sub-mm, interstitial Fe-bearing manganite [(Fe 31, Mn 31) O(OH) ], and smectite. The pervasive distribution and fine grain size of the secondary minerals indicate that mixed analyses of primary and secondary material are unavoidable in in situ methods, even in <b>ion</b> microprobe <b>spots</b> only 10 mm in diameter, and that bulk chemical analyses are severely biased. Increases in other elements, including the rare earth elements, U, F, and possibly Sr apparently reflect additional alteration of apatite in both dentine and enamel. Extreme care will be required to separate secondary minerals from original biogenic apatite for paleobiological or paleoclimate studies, and nonetheless bulk analyses of purified apatite may be suspect. Although the PO 4 component of teeth seems resistant to chemical alteration, the OH component is extensively altered. This OH alteration implies that bulk analyses of fossil tooth enamel for oxygen isotope composition may be systematically biased by 61 ‰, and seasonal records of oxygen isotope composition may be spuriously shifted, enhanced, or diminished.

40|$|Zusammenfassung (dt.) Abstract: Quantum {{computing}} and quantum {{information processing}} is a promising path to replace classical information processing via conventional computers which are approaching fundamental physical limits. Instead of classical bits, quantum bits (qubits) are utilized for computing operations. Due to quantum mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement, {{a completely different}} way of information processing is achieved, enabling enhanced performance for certain problem sets. Various proposals exist on how to realize a quantum bit. Among them are electron or nuclear spins of defect centers in solid state systems. Two such candidates with spin degree of freedom are single donor atoms in silicon and nitrogen vacancy (NV) defect centers in diamond. Both qubit candidates possess extraordinary qualities which makes them promising building blocks. Besides certain advantages, the qubits share the necessity to be placed precisely in their host materials and device structures. A commonly used method is to introduce the donor atoms into the substrate materials via ion implantation. For this, focused ion beam systems can be used, or collimation techniques as in this work. A broad ion beam hits {{the back of a}} scanning probe microscope (SPM) cantilever with incorporated apertures. The high resolution imaging capabilities of the SPM allows the non destructive location of device areas and the alignment of the cantilever and thus collimated <b>ion</b> beam <b>spot</b> to the desired implant locations. In this work, this technique is explored, applied and pushed forward to meet necessary precision requirements. The alignment of the ion beam to surface features, which are sensitive to ion impacts and thus act as detectors, is demonstrated. The technique is also used to create NV center arrays in diamond substrates. Further, single ion impacts into silicon device structures are detected which enables deliberate single ion doping...|$|R

We propose that arrays of phase Fresnel lenses (PFLs) are a favorable optical coupling technology to match with multi-zone ion traps. Both are scalable technologies based on conventional micro-fabrication techniques. The large numerical apertures (NAs) possible with PFLs can reduce the readout time for ion qubits. PFLs also provide good coherent ion-photon coupling by matching a large fraction of an ion’s emission pattern to a single optical propagation mode (TEM 00).

30|$|However, such {{study does}} not {{consider}} the inverse effect (i.e., the ionospheric influence on the thermospheric parameters and on the electric field), which in some cases may be very important.

However, {{the impact of the}} ionosphere on the neutral density and wind structures is not well understood.

The simulation results (Maruyama et al., 2003) suggested that ion drag parallel to the field lines, in the vicinity of a pronounced equatorial ionization anomaly, has a significant impact on the latitudinal structure of the equatorial neutral wind and on the temperature structure. Fully self-consistent thermosphere-ionosphere-electrodynamics models were used recently (e.g., Lu et al., 2008; Klimenko et al., 2011) for understanding of formation mechanisms of ionospheric disturbances during geomagnetic storms.|$|R
40|$|The {{velocity}} {{distribution function}} of vacuum arc ions {{can be measured}} by a time-of-flight technique similar to a method originally proposed by Yushkov. The measuring principle makes use of the well-justified assumption that the ion drift velocity from the cathode spot region to a collector is approximately constant. It is shown that the negative time derivative of the collector current is directly proportional to the ion distribution function provided that the time-averaged source intensity (i. e., emission of <b>ions</b> from cathode <b>spots)</b> is constant until the arc is rapidly switched off. In the experiment, arc termination took about 700 ns, which is much faster than the decay of the ion current measured at the collector placed in more than 2 meters distance from the cathode. The experimental distribution functions for most cathode materials show one large peak with a tail and one or more small peaks at higher ion velocities. The distribution functions for some other materials exhibit several peaks. No conclusive answer can be given {{about the nature of}} these peaks. Arguments are presented that the peaks are not caused by different charge states or plasma contamination but rather due to insufficiently averaged source fluctuations and/or acceleration by plasma instabilities...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of the polar ionosphere to magnetospheric storm inputs was modeled. During the “storm,” the spatial extent of the auroral oval, {{the intensity of the}} precipitating auroral electron energy flux, and the plasma convection pattern were varied with time. The convection pattern changed from a symmetric two-cell pattern with a 20 -kV cross-tail potential to an asymmetric two-cell pattern with enhanced plasma flow in the dusk sector and a total cross-tail potential of 90 kV. During the storm there were significant changes in the ion temperature, ion composition, and molecular/atomic ion transition height. The storm time asymmetric convection pattern produced an <b>ion</b> temperature hot <b>spot</b> at the location of the dusk convection cell owing to increased ion-neutral frictional heating. In this hot spot there were significantly enhanced NO+ densities and hence molecular/atomic ion transition heights. During the storm recovery phase, the decay of the enhanced NO+ densities closely followed the decrease in the plasma convection speed. During the storm, elevated ion temperatures also appeared at high altitudes in the midnight-dawn auroral oval region. These elevated ion temperatures were a consequence of the storm-enhanced topside O+ densities, which provided better thermal coupling to the hot electrons. This region also contained reduced molecular/atomic ion transition heights. These elevated ion temperatures and reduced transition heights persisted for several hours after the storm main phase ended...|$|R
40|$|New U–Pb geochronology for an {{extensive}} exposure of high-pressure granulites in the East Lake Athabasca {{region of the}} western Canadian shield {{is consistent with a}} history characterized by 2. 55 Ga stabilization of cratonic lithosphere, 650 million years of lower crustal residence and cratonic stability, and 1. 9 Ga reactivation of the craton during lithospheric attenuation and asthenospheric upwelling. High precision single-grain and fragment zircon data define distinctive discordia arrays between 2. 55 and 1. 9 Ga. U–Pb <b>ion</b> microprobe <b>spot</b> analyses yield a similar range of U–Pb dates with no obvious correlation between date and cathodoluminescence zonation. We attribute the complex U–Pb zircon systematics to growth of the primary populations during a 2. 55 Ga high-pressure granulite facies event (~ 1. 3 GPa, 850 °C) recorded by the dominant mineral assemblage of the mafic granulite gneisses, with subsequent zircon recrystallization and minor secondary zircon growth during a second high-pressure granulite facies event (1. 0 GPa, ~ 800 °C) at 1. 9 Ga. The occurrence of two discrete granulite facies metamorphic events in the lower crust, separated by an interval of 650 million years that included isobaric cooling for at least some of this time, suggests that the rocks resided at lower crustal depths until 1. 9 Ga. We infer that this phase of lower crustal residence and little tectonic activity is coincident with an extended period of cratonic stability. Detailed structural and thermochronological datasets indicate that multistage unroofing of the lower crustal rocks occurred in the following 200 million years. Extended lower crustal residence would logically be the history inferred for lower crust in most cratonic regions, but the unusual aspect of the history in the East Lake Athabasca region is the subsequent lithospheric reactivation that initiated transport of the lower crust to the surface. We suggest that a weakened strength profile related to the 1. 9 Ga heating left the lithosphere susceptible to far-field tectonic stresses from bounding orogens that drove the lower crustal exhumation. An ultimate return to cratonic stability is responsible for the preservation of this extensive lower crustal exposure since 1. 7 Ga...|$|R
40|$|Eocene gem zircons from Reddistone Creek, Glen Innes, Australia, {{have been}} {{assessed}} for isotopic and chemical homogeneity by Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS), Isotope Dilution Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ID TIMS), Laser Ablation-Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), and Wavelength Dispersive X-ray analysis (WDS). Sensitive High-Resolution Ion Microprobe (SHRIMP) SIMS {{data show that}} the U-Pb and Th-Pb isotope systems are homogeneous at the <b>ion</b> microprobe <b>spot</b> mass of a few ng for two zircons, AusZ 2 and AusZ 5, and that AusZ 2 has good homogeneity in U, Th, and Th/U ratio. Twelve ID U-Pb TIMS analyses of separate 200 – 400 µm chips, measured in two different laboratories, show that AusZ 2 has remarkable isotopic homogeneity at the sub-permil level, is concordant, and has a 206 Pb- 238 U age of 38. 8963 ± 0. 0044 Ma (2 σ; n = 12, MSWD = 1. 01). A similar data set for AusZ 5 shows that this gem has a similarly precise and reproducible 206 Pb- 238 U age of 38. 9022 ± 0. 0035 Ma (2 σ; n = 12, MSWD = 2. 4), but exhibits scatter in 207 Pb- 235 U that is in excess of that expected based on the uncertainty of individual analyses (weighted mean 207 Pb- 235 U date of 39. 162 ± 0. 054 Ma, 2 σ; n = 12, MSWD= 10. 0), with two concordant analyses and 10 slightly discordant analyses (0. 7 %). The slight discordance of AusZ 5 may reflect an initial excess of 231 Pa. The AusZ 2 and AusZ 5 ID TIMS data sets demonstrate the excellent reproducibility of measurements between labs using the EARTHTIME calibration spikes and solutions. LA-ICP-MS trace element data indicate that AusZ 2 is also very homogeneous for the REE and other trace elements, whereas AusZ 5 shows trace element heterogeneity. WDS analysis confirms the major element homogeneity of these zircons. Our data show that the AusZ 2 zircon will be an excellent Reference Material (RM) for ID TIMS, SIMS, and LA-ICP-MS microanalysis of U-Pb isotopes and trace elements in Cainozoic zircons...|$|R
