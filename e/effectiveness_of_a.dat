5|$|The team's {{previous}} experience was with turn-based combat games, and it struggled {{to develop a}} real-time combat system affected by customizable attributes and abilities that provided feedback to the player on how those statistics were affecting the battle. It initially found that by adhering too closely to the White Wolf source material rules for guns, where the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shot is determined in a contest between the player's skill and the opponent's defense, the firearms seemed broken; the player would not hit where they aimed.

25|$|One of {{the major}} {{limitations}} of photon radiation therapy is that the cells of solid tumors become deficient in oxygen.

25|$|The <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> physician's {{recommendation}} for the HPV vaccine {{also contributes to}} low vaccination rates and controversy surrounding the vaccine. A 2015 study of national physician communication {{and support for the}} HPV vaccine found physicians routinely recommend HPV vaccines less strongly than they recommend Tdap or meningitis vaccines, find the discussion about HPV to be long and burdensome, and discuss the HPV vaccine last, after all other vaccines. Researchers suggest these factors discourage patients and parents from setting up timely HPV vaccines. In order to increase vaccination rates, this issue must be addressed and physicians should be better trained to handle discussing the importance of the HPV vaccine with patients and their families.|$|E

As it is difficult to account for all aspects of the market, a manager should look to incorporate both experienced judgements from senior executives as well modifying these judgements in light of economically justifiable information gathering. An example of the application of Bayesian decision theory for promotional purposes could be the use of a test sample in order to assess the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> promotion prior to a full scale rollout.

25|$|Electronic Arts {{released}} The Sims 2 on September 14, 2004. The sequel, {{developed by}} Maxis, {{takes place in}} a full 3D environment as opposed to the dimetric projection of the original game. Sims also age through seven life stages from infancy to old age and subsequent death. Another major feature is the aspiration system. Each Sim exhibits wants and fears according to its aspiration and personality. Consequently, the level of the aspiration meter determines the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Sim at completing tasks. The fulfillment of wants provides aspiration points, which could then be used to purchase aspiration rewards. In addition, the game features clear days of the week, with weekends when children can stay home from school and vacation days when adults can take time off work.|$|E

40|$|Hillman and Ursprung (1988) and Fabella (1991) analyze {{lobbying}} contest {{models with}} homogeneous agents {{to show that}} the equilibrium probability of high tariff being imposed is decreasing in the number of pro-tariff domestic firms.

25|$|When a {{motivating}} operation causes {{an increase}} in the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reinforcer, or amplifies a learned behavior in some way (such as increasing frequency, intensity, duration or speed of the behavior), it functions as an establishing operation, EO. A common example of this would be food deprivation, which functions as an EO in relation to food: the food-deprived organism will perform behaviors previously related to the acquisition of food more intensely, frequently, longer, or faster in the presence of food, and those behaviors would be especially strongly reinforced. For instance, a fast-food worker earning minimal wage, forced to work more than one job to make ends meet, would be highly motivated by a pay raise, because of the current deprivation of money (a conditioned establishing operation). The worker would work hard to try to achieve the raise, and getting the raise would function as an especially strong reinforcer of work behavior.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, a {{motivating}} {{operation that}} causes {{a decrease in}} the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reinforcer, or diminishes a learned behavior related to the reinforcer, functions as an abolishing operation, AO. Again using the example of food, satiation of food prior to the presentation of a food stimulus would produce a decrease on food-related behaviors, and diminish or completely abolish the reinforcing effect of acquiring and ingesting the food. Consider the board of a large investment bank, concerned with a too small profit margin, deciding to give the CEO a new incentive package in order to motivate him to increase firm profits. If the CEO already has a lot of money, the incentive package might not be a very good way to motivate him, because he would be satiated on money. Getting even more money wouldn't be a strong reinforcer for profit-increasing behavior, and wouldn't elicit increased intensity, frequency or duration of profit-increasing behavior.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, Terry-McElarth {{and colleagues}} {{published}} {{a study in}} the American Journal of Preventative Medicine on regular soda policies and their effect on school beverage availability and student consumption.

The study analyzed state- and school district-level policies mandating soda bans and found that state bans were associated with significantly lower school soda availability but district bans showed no significant associations. In addition, no significant correlation was observed between state policies and student consumption. Among student populations, state policy was directly associated with significantly lower school soda availability and indirectly associated with lower student consumption. The same was not observed for other student populations.|$|E

40|$|Shielding {{effectiveness}} (SE) is <b>an</b> important measure <b>of</b> {{how well}} <b>an</b> enclosure reduces the electromagnetic (EM) field incident upon it. Commonly, when the shielding <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> enclosure is stated {{it is for}} the case when the enclosure is empty. Including contents such as printed circuit boards (PCBs) in the enclosure will affect the shielding effectiveness as the PCB absorbs EM energy. One technique of determining how much energy a PCB absorbs is to measure its absorption cross section (ACS) using a reverberation chamber (RC). The measured ACS can be used to predict the shielding <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> enclosure when the PCB is inside it using power balance techniques. In this paper the ACS <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> PCBs are measured both individually and in closely stacked groups. This information is then used to show how the ACS can be used to calculate shielding effectiveness and the results are compared to direct measurement of the SE of the enclosure containing <b>a</b> PCB.
