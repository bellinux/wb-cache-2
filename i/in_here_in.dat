25|$|Rhoiteion's {{greatest}} asset was the {{suitability of}} its coast for harbouring ships and its location on the Hellespont which connected the Black Sea to the Aegean Sea vis the Sea of Marmara; when it appears in the sources, it is usually for this reason. Famously, its coast was where the Achaeans beached their ships. The Peloponnesian fleet put <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> the summer of 411 BC, and in 409 BC the Athenian fleet beached along these shores, sheltering from the winter storms. The promontory of Aeantion in the west of Rhoiteion's territory was commonly used as a harbour in Roman times: in Philostratus' Life of Apollonius of Tyana, written in the late 2nd century AD, Apollonius finds many ships at anchor here and takes passage on one, and in AD 324 the fleet of Licinius {{spent the night at}} anchor here before going into battle against Crispus. In modern times, locals have referred to most of the bays along this coast {{at one time or another}} as Karanlık Limanı (Turkish ‘concealed harbour’).|$|E
