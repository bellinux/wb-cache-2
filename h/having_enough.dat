5|$|By 1986, {{the company}} was once again in serious {{financial}} trouble. During 1985 they had taken the show outside Quebec to a lukewarm response. In Toronto they performed {{in front of a}} 25% capacity crowd after not <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> money to properly market the show. Gilles Ste-Croix, dressed in a monkey suit, walked through downtown Toronto as a desperate publicity stunt. A later stop in Niagara Falls turned out to be equally problematic.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, after Laliberté re-privatized Cirque du Soleil, it {{was invited}} to perform at the Los Angeles Arts Festival. Although they {{continued}} to be plagued by financial difficulties, Normand Latourelle took the gamble and went to Los Angeles, despite only <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> money to make a one-way trip. Had the show been a failure, the company {{would not have had}} enough money to get their performers and equipment back to Montreal.|$|E

5|$|Starting {{at its own}} 10-yard line, Virginia Tech ran three {{straight}} running plays {{in an effort to}} run the clock down and prevent Boston College from <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> time to conduct another offensive drive. After the third run was stopped for no gain, however, the Hokies were forced to punt the ball. Boston College now had 28seconds to score a touchdown and either tie the game with an extra point or win it with a two-point conversion.|$|E

5|$|A diver {{missing a}} {{required}} decompression stop {{increases the risk}} of developing decompression sickness. The risk is related to the depth and duration of the missed stops. The usual causes for missing stops are: not <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> breathing gas to complete the stops, or accidentally losing control of buoyancy. An aim of most basic diver training is to prevent these two faults. There are also less predictable causes of missing decompression stops. Diving suit failure in cold water may force the diver to choose between hypothermia and decompression sickness. Diver injury or marine animal attack may also limit the duration of stops the diver is willing to carry out.|$|E
5|$|Even before Bradford City were {{guaranteed}} {{a place in}} the Football League, the club made its first acquisitions by signing Jack Forrest and Ben Prosser from Stoke on 1 May. These were followed by four more players joining the club; Sam Bright, George Robinson, Peter O'Rourke and Jimmy Millar. Despite not <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> players to field a full side, four club representatives travelled to London by the end of May for a league management committee meeting, when the club was elected into the Second Division. Money was raised to fund the club, including at least £2,000 from sponsors, a balance of £500 from Manningham FC and proceeds from a summer archery tournament. Bradford City also took over Manningham's Valley Parade ground for their home fixtures.|$|E
5|$|Nadodi Mannan was {{released}} on 22 August 1958. The expenses made for the film resulted in Ramachandran not <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> money to buy release prints. Hence, Veerappan and Chakrapani decided to acquire a legal loan of 50,000 from AVM Productions. However, Ramachandran's signature was required for the loan contract. When they consulted with him on this issue, he asked Veerappan and Chakrapani to tell the studio's founder A. V. Meiyappan that they would repay the loan and keep the price paid by the production company, Cinemas Limited, for distribution rights for the film's release in Sri Lanka as collateral. Meiyappan agreed to provide the loan, which was repaid by Veerappan immediately after the film's release.|$|E

5|$|The inaugural champions were Sarita and Wilde, who {{defeated}} The Beautiful People (Rayne and Sky) in {{the finals}} of an eight-team tournament to crown the first TNA Knockouts Tag Team Champions. At 478 days, Eric Young and ODB hold {{the record for the}} longest reign in the title's history. Awesome Kong's and Hamada's only reign holds the record for the shortest reign in the title's history at 63 days. As of June 27, 2013, the championships are retired due to TNA not <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> female talent for a Tag Team Division. Young is the first and only male wrestler to have held the title. Overall, there have been nine reigns shared between 15 wrestlers and nine teams.|$|E
5|$|While {{majoring in}} drama at Northwestern University, Gittings {{developed}} a close but non-sexual friendship with another female student, prompting {{rumors that the}} two were lesbians, which led Gittings to examine her own sexual orientation. In her attempts to understand it, she had her suspicions confirmed by a psychiatrist who offered to cure her. Not <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> money to make regular visits, {{she was unable to}} get the money from her father, who reasoned there were no problems a psychiatrist could solve that a priest could not. A close friend suggested they see less of each other so as not to further encourage the rumors about them.|$|E
5|$|Cannon Fodder 2 is a military-themed action {{game with}} {{strategy}} and shoot 'em up elements. The player controls a small squad {{of up to}} four soldiers. These soldiers are armed with machine guns which kill enemy infantry with a single round. The player's troops are similarly fragile, and while they possess superior fire-power at the game's outset the enemy infantry becomes more powerful as the game progresses. As well as foot soldiers, the antagonists include vehicles and missile-armed turrets. The player must also destroy buildings which spawn enemy soldiers. For these targets, which are invulnerable to machine gun fire, the player must use secondary, explosive weaponry: grenades and rockets. Ammunition for these weapons is limited and the player must find supply crates to replenish his troops. Wasting these weapons can potentially result in the player not <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> to fulfil the mission objectives. The player can opt to shoot crates – destroying enemy troops and buildings in the ensuing explosion – at less risk to his soldiers than retrieving them, but again at {{a greater risk of}} depleting ammunition.|$|E

5|$|Guido Forti {{alleged that}} Shannon Racing had not paid him any money within the stipulated six-day {{deadline}} after {{the deal was}} concluded and refuted the claim that it now owned 51% of his team. As the team ran out of money, it was doubtful whether it would turn up at the British GP. In the end, Forti took part, only for the cars to complete a mere handful of laps each in practice and thus failing to set a time quick enough to qualify. This was because it was becoming increasingly in debt to Cosworth and {{was running out of}} engine mileage for its cars, only <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> to make a token effort at participation. The team made it to the next race - the German GP - but both cars remained unassembled in the pit garages throughout the weekend after the engine supply was finally cut off.|$|E
5|$|The chassis of the C5 {{consists}} of two identical metal pressings which are joined at top and bottom with a closing plate at the rear. It lacks a separate suspension system, instead relying on the chassis structure <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> torsional flex. Its motor was produced in Italy by Polymotor, {{a subsidiary of the}} Dutch company Philips. Although it was later famously said that the C5 was powered by a washing machine motor, the motor was in fact developed from a design produced to drive a truck cooling fan. Lotus provided the gearbox and a rear axle based on a design for car steering columns. The C5's electronics were produced by MetaLab, a Sinclair spin-off. The wheels were assembled from tyres made in Taiwan and wheels from Italy. Oldham Batteries provided a lead-acid battery developed for Sinclair that could manage more than the 300 charge-discharge cycles that had originally been specified.|$|E
5|$|The main {{adaptations of}} the {{pinniped}} circulatory system for diving are the enlargement and increased complexity of veins {{to increase their}} capacity. Retia mirabilia form blocks of tissue on the inner wall of the thoracic cavity and the body periphery. These tissue masses, which contain extensive contorted spirals of arteries and thin-walled veins, act as blood reservoirs that increase oxygen stores for use during diving. As with other diving mammals, pinnipeds have high amounts of hemoglobin and myoglobin stored in their blood and muscles. This allows them to stay submerged {{for long periods of}} time while still <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> oxygen. Deep-diving species such as elephant seals have blood volumes that make up to 20% of their body weight. When diving, they reduce their heart rate and maintain blood flow only to the heart, brain and lungs. To keep their blood pressure stable, phocids have an elastic aorta that dissipates some energy of each heartbeat.|$|E

5|$|Before Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare was released, it was {{predicted}} to sell even more copies than the highly successful Halo 3; it had received reviews as high as Halo 3s, it was launching on three systems as opposed to one for Halo 3, and demand for the game led {{to a wide range}} of retailers only <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> available to satisfy pre-orders. It fulfilled the prediction and the Xbox 360 version became the best-selling video game in the United States from November 2007 to January 2008 according to the NPD Group. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions would go on to sell 1.57 million and 444,000 units, respectively, in the United States in November 2007. 1.47 million units of the Xbox 360 version were sold in December 2007; the game sold 331,000 copies for the Xbox 360 and 140,000 copies for the PlayStation 3 in January 2008. The Xbox 360 version was the third best-selling video game of 2007 in the U.S. with 3.04 million units sold, behind Halo 3, which sold 4.82 million units, according to the NPD Group. By January 2008, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare had sold more than 7 million copies worldwide, and was the best-selling game of 2007. On June 3, 2008, Infinity Ward reported that the game had sold over 10 million units. During a May 2009 conference call, Activision announced that the game has sold 13 million copies, surpassing Super Mario Galaxy as the best selling game released that week of November 2007. By November 2013, the game had sold 15.7 million copies.|$|E
