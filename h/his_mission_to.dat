The British ambassador was enthusiastic about the idea, and within one week he arranged for Montefiore a meeting with Reshid Pasha. Montefiore prepared a draft text of the firman and had its French translation read to Reshid Pasha, who responded encouragingly.|$|E

5|$|During {{their attempt}} to escape Nalbina Dungeon, Vaan, Balthier, and Fran {{discovered}} Basch chained in a cage suspended from the ceiling. Though all three were initially suspicious of him (especially Vaan, who blamed him for Reks's death), Basch protested his innocence and told them about his twin. The party decided his story was plausible and released him. After being freed, he made it <b>his</b> <b>mission</b> <b>to</b> protect Ashe and support the resistance. When {{he and his brother}} were reunited, Gabranth was deeply puzzled by Basch's continued ability to hold his head high in spite of his past failures. Basch explained that his vow to defend Ashe had given him purpose and a renewed sense of honor. After the final battle against Vayne, as Noah was dying, he asked Basch to take his place as Larsa's protector. Because it was still widely believed that Basch was dead, he adopted his brother's name and title when he entered Larsa's service. In Revenant Wings, Basch is sent by Larsa to be the Empire's representative in dealing with the Judge of Wings. Basch was voiced by Keith Ferguson in English and by Rikiya Koyama in Japanese.

5|$|However, {{the bombs}} failed to explode as planned, because the battery had expired due to {{long periods of}} storage. Determined the {{operation}} would remain a secret, the commandos snuck back to Core and retrieved the explosive devices. Not long afterwards, Core and its crew sailed out of Saigon, intact without any damage. Nao, on the other hand, reported the failure of <b>his</b> <b>mission</b> <b>to</b> the Saigon-Gia Dinh Military District Headquarters; his superiors did not express disappointment in {{the failure of the}} operation, but instead they encouraged Nao and his men to destroy Card at all costs. Finally on May 1, 1964, Viet Cong reconnaissance teams spotted USNS Card as the ship sailed through Ganh Rai Bay and entered Long Tau River, so they immediately reported the information to the 65th Special Operations Group in Saigon. As usual, Card docked at the commercial port district in the city to unload another shipment of cargo and military helicopters, as well as upload a batch of helicopters scheduled to be returned to the United States.|$|E
5|$|To {{communicate}} with his handlers, Lody {{was instructed to}} write to certain addresses in Christiania (now Oslo), Stockholm, New York City and Rome. He acquired an American emergency passport {{in the name of}} Charles A.Inglis, a genuine document obtained from the US Embassy in Berlin. When Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August, newly imposed restrictions prevented foreigners from leaving Germany without travel documents. Embassies and consulates throughout the country experienced a rush of visitors as foreigners sought emergency passports; these had to be submitted to the German Foreign Ministry to obtain exit permits for neutral Denmark or the Netherlands. One such applicant was the real Charles A. Inglis, whose passport went missing– lost, it was claimed, although in fact the Foreign Ministry had appropriated it for Lody's use. As the passport lacked security features such as the holder's photograph or fingerprints, being merely a single-sheet document, it was well-suited for use by a spy. Lody said later that he had received it in the post from his superiors atN. He was also given £250 in British banknotes, 1,000 Danish krone and 1,000 Norwegian krone to finance <b>his</b> <b>mission</b> <b>to</b> the UK, where he would travel via Denmark and Norway.|$|E
