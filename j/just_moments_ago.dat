500|$|The brawl {{began after}} a {{face-off}} as Shesterikov collided with Everett Sanipass with 6:07 {{left in the}} second period, resulting in a fight between the two. Soviet player Pavel Kostichkin also leveled a two-handed slash at Fleury, leading to another fight. The battle quickly escalated into a line brawl involving all skaters on the ice for both teams. Returning from a commercial break, Canadian commentator Don Wittman understated {{the severity of the}} fighting by saying [...] "well, we had a real skirmish <b>just</b> <b>moments</b> <b>ago</b> following a face-off." [...] Evgeny Davydov was the first player from either team to leave his bench to join the melee, prompting all players from both teams to leave their benches.|$|E
50|$|When night falls, Natsuki disappears, and Takako and Yuka are non-fatally poisoned, {{prompting}} Yoko {{to leave}} in search of aid. In the morning, Ai looks over footage shot by Natsuki, which shows her being assaulted by someone wearing the Noh mask. Ai runs outside and finds Maki, {{who claims to have}} seen the masked woman <b>just</b> <b>moments</b> <b>ago.</b> The two then find all the missing food dumped in the woods, along with the Noh mask and now bloodied cleaver. The girls return to the house, and discover Takako and Yayoi are gone, so they go in search of them along with a recovered Yuka, soon stumbling onto the bodies of Natsuki and Yayoi. The trio returns to the lodge (where Takako has been hiding) and decide to hold out until the morning. A bloodied Yoko appears banging on the door, begging for help, moments before the Noh-masked figure breaks in.|$|E

One day, he overhears his friend David making love next door. He then hears David's girlfriend pounding on the door, demanding to know who's in his room with him. Shelly (Beverly D'Angelo) comes into Elgin's room wearing only a towel, implying she was the woman with David <b>just</b> a <b>moment</b> <b>ago.</b> Shelly says she will only be there for a short time until David finishes making love with his girlfriend; but it takes a lot longer. David thanks Elgin by setting him up with Shelly.|$|R

40|$|Most {{existing}} {{data mining}} approaches to e-commerce recommendation are past data model-based {{in the sense}} that they rst build a preference model from a past dataset and then apply the model to current customer situations. Such approaches are not suitable for applications where fresh data should be collected instantly since it reects changes to customer preferences over some products. This paper targets those e-commerce environments in which knowledge of customer preferences may change frequently. But due to the very large size of past datasets the preference models cannot be updated instantly in response to the changes. We present an approach to making real time online recommendations based on an up-to-moment dataset which includes not only a gigantic past dataset but the most recent data that may be collected <b>just</b> <b>moments</b> <b>ago...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{quarter of}} a century is but a moment on the cosmic calendar. Now that Marshall Space Flight Center has reached its 25 th Anniversity, it seems <b>just</b> <b>moments</b> <b>ago</b> that President Dwight D. Eisenhower stood on these grounds and {{formally}} dedicated the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. The Fiscal Year 1985 Research and Technology Report reflects the wide spectrum of activities closely linked with the Center's mainstream spaceflight developments. Past accomplishments testify to the success of getting deeply involved in the science and technology of its projects - 32 Saturn launches, Pegasus, the Skylab missions, three High Energy Astronomy Observatory missions, the Apollo - Soyuz mission, and an accelerating schedule of successful Shuttle, Spacelab, and Shuttle payload missions. The Center continues to be involved in engineering development, scientific research, and technology. At the beginning of the second quarter century, the experience and dedication of the engineers and scientists, and the success of the collaboration with industry and academia will now be aimed at the next great endeavor, the Space Station...|$|E
50|$|In phenomenology, {{the lived}} body {{is your own}} body as {{experienced}} by yourself, as yourself. Your own body manifests itself to you mainly as your possibilities of acting in the world. It is what lets you reach out and grab something, for instance, but it also, and more importantly, allows {{for the possibility of}} changing your point of view. This helps you differentiate one thing from another by the experience of moving around it, seeing new aspects of it (often referred to as making the absent present and the present absent), and still retaining the notion that this is the same thing that you saw other aspects of <b>just</b> a <b>moment</b> <b>ago</b> (it is identical). Your body is also experienced as a duality, both as object (you can touch your own hand) and as your own subjectivity (you are being touched).|$|R
50|$|After the kiss, Cole and Starr fled {{away from}} the high school. They decided {{to run to the}} nearby park and discuss what {{happened}} back at school. Cole claimed that he wasn't quite sure why Starr suddenly jumped him like that in public. Starr then reacted, by stating that no one was around now, as she then kissed him once more. Cole then claimed that though it was nice and he liked it, it didn't seem like Starr was acting as her normal self. Cole questioned her for acting the way she did, though Starr would not answer. Embarrassed, Starr walked away trying to forget what had <b>just</b> happened <b>moments</b> <b>ago.</b> She second-guessed what had happened in the hall that day and kept on apologizing. As she tried to walk away, Cole stopped her, asking for the true reason she's acting in such a matter. Hesitantly, Starr claimed that it was because of Britney and how she was trying to steal him away from her. Cole smirked, then explained how Starr never had to change, in order to grab his attention. He then stated that Starr was the type of girl who never cared about Britney and that she was better than that.|$|R
50|$|In phenomenology, empathy {{refers to}} the {{experience}} of one's own body as another. While we often identify others with their physical bodies, this type of phenomenology requires that we focus on the subjectivity of the other, as well as our intersubjective engagement with them. In Husserl's original account, this was done by a sort of apperception built on the experiences of your own lived-body. The lived body is your own body as experienced by yourself, as yourself. Your own body manifests itself to you mainly as your possibilities of acting in the world. It is what lets you reach out and grab something, for instance, but it also, and more importantly, allows for the possibility of changing your point of view. This helps you differentiate one thing from another by the experience of moving around it, seeing new aspects of it (often referred to as making the absent present and the present absent), and still retaining the notion that this is the same thing that you saw other aspects of <b>just</b> a <b>moment</b> <b>ago</b> (it is identical). Your body is also experienced as a duality, both as object (you can touch your own hand) and as your own subjectivity (you experience being touched).|$|R

She added: “The record company rang me <b>just</b> a <b>moment</b> <b>ago</b> and told me it’s doing well on the pre-orders, which in itself feels amazing. I performed on QVC last week and that’s what got the sales rocketing - I didn’t believe that could happen.The album includes familiar tracks which Byrne performed on The X Factor such as [...] "It's a Man's Man's Man's World", [...] "I (Who Have Nothing)" [...] and [...] "The Way We Were".
