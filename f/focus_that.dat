5|$|On Athas, {{the planet}} of the Dark Sun {{campaign}} setting, dwarves stand less than 5' tall and weigh nearly 200lbs. Each dwarf pursues a singular obsession, called a <b>focus,</b> <b>that</b> requires {{at least a week}} to complete. Athasian dwarves do not live underground, but some communities focus on unearthing long-lost dwarven strongholds. Physically, the dwarves of Athas are unique among their kind, having no hair at all. Athasian dwarves can breed with humans to produce muls, who are sterile offsprings that share the strength and resiliency of dwarves with the size of humans.|$|E
5|$|The {{school has}} {{developed}} a specific program <b>focus</b> <b>that</b> includes film, photography, writing, and art, using Gordon Parks's life as an inspiration and guide. In partnership with the Minnesota Historical Society, students are documenting stages of transition along University Avenue through the stories of elders, business owners, and residents affected by the METRO Green Line light-rail transit project.

25|$|Other {{reviews of}} the book and audio-book were mixed. The {{reviewer}} in The New York Times mentioned (by way of criticism) that Sophocles and Freud had pursued the same idea that forms the book's <b>focus,</b> <b>that</b> is, that we are defined by our fears. Greil Marcus said Rakoff's stories are not as funny as those he read on the radio.|$|E

25|$|The Homosexual Front of Revolutionary Action (Frente Homosexual de Acción Revolucionaria) {{protested the}} 1983 roundups in Guadalajara, Jalisco. The onset of AIDS during the mid-1980s created {{considerable}} debate and public discussion about homosexuality. Many voices, both supportive and opposing (such as the Roman Catholic Church), participated in public discussions that increased awareness {{and understanding of}} homosexuality. LGBT groups were instrumental in initiating programs to combat AIDS, which was a shift in <b>focus</b> <b>that</b> curtailed (at least temporarily) the emphasis on gay organizing.|$|E

Colorado state law mandates Schools of Choice, meaning that parents can opt their child into any school in the district beyond their assigned neighborhood school, if space is available.|$|E
25|$|The OLPC {{project has}} been the subject of {{extensive}} praise and criticism. It was praised for enabling low-cost, low-power machines; for assuring consensus at ministerial level in many countries that computer literacy is a mainstream part of education; for creating interfaces that worked without literacy in any language, and particularly without literacy in English. It has been criticized from many sides regarding its US-centric <b>focus</b> <b>that</b> ignores bigger problems, high total costs that may actually even be quite cost-ineffective, low focus on maintainability and training and its limited success so far.|$|E

25|$|Lauro {{defended his}} shot put and discus titles at the 2009 South American Championships in Athletics, having his season's best marks of 19.20m and 60.41m there. He gained {{selection}} for both {{events at the}} 2009 World Championships in Athletics, but {{did not make the}} final in either event. With few major international events in 2010, his <b>focus</b> <b>that</b> year was the Ibero-American Championships. He was fourth in the discus but reached new distances in the shot put event, taking the silver medal with a significant improvement to 20.43m. He was only beaten by Marco Fortes in the last series of throws.|$|E
25|$|In 1924, Miró {{joined the}} Surrealist group. The already {{symbolic}} and poetic nature of Miró’s work, {{as well as}} the dualities and contradictions inherent to it, fit well within the context of dream-like automatism espoused by the group. Much of Miró’s work lost the cluttered chaotic lack of <b>focus</b> <b>that</b> had defined his work thus far, and he experimented with collage and the process of painting within his work so as to reject the framing that traditional painting provided. This antagonistic attitude towards painting manifested itself when Miró referred to his work in 1924 ambiguously as “x” in a letter to poet friend Michel Leiris. The paintings that came out of this period were eventually dubbed Miró’s dream paintings.|$|E
25|$|Goumri {{improved}} {{one place}} to 14th in the long race at the 2004 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, but the Moroccans were edged into fourth by the Eritrean team. Track became his <b>focus</b> <b>that</b> year and he made his Olympic debut in August, reaching the 5000m final at the 2004 Athens Olympics and ending the race in 13th place. He was ninth at the 2004 IAAF World Athletics Final, but gained a medal on the regional stage {{as he took the}} silver behind Khoudir Aggoune at the Pan Arab Games. Eighteenth in the short race at the 2005 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, he and his teammates Adil Kaouch, Mohamed Moustaoui and Hicham Bellani were again the fourth best (beaten this time by Qatar).|$|E

25|$|In {{some cases}} S2 is negative, {{indicating}} that the image is formed {{on the opposite side}} of the lens from where those rays are being considered. Since the diverging light rays emanating from the lens never come into focus, and those rays are not physically present at the point where they appear to form an image, this is called a virtual image. Unlike real images, a virtual image cannot be projected on a screen, but appears to an observer looking through the lens as if it were a real object at the location of that virtual image. Likewise, it appears to a subsequent lens as if it were an object at that location, so that second lens could again <b>focus</b> <b>that</b> light into a real image, S1 then being measured from the virtual image location behind the first lens to the second lens. This is exactly what the eye does when looking through a magnifying glass. The magnifying glass creates a (magnified) virtual image behind the magnifying glass, but those rays are then re-imaged by the lens of the eye to create a real image on the retina.|$|E
500|$|On its {{original}} release in March 1995, The Beacon Street Collection was only available in local record stores in Orange County, California and at No Doubt's shows. Its rawer sound proved {{popular with the}} band's fans and the band's first batch of one thousand copies sold out within {{only a few months}} after its release. Interscope realized the band's potential and allowed them to record their third album, Tragic Kingdom in various Los Angeles studios, [...] "wherever they could get a deal on a studio". During a recording session, the band was introduced to Paul Palmer, who was interested in mixing the new album. He owned his own record label Trauma Records, which was associated with Interscope. Interscope willingly sublicensed the project to Trauma Records in 1995 and Tragic Kingdom got the personal <b>focus</b> <b>that</b> comes from a small company.|$|E
500|$|Acid Tongue has {{received}} generally favorable reviews, scoring a 75% on review aggregator Metacritic. Creative Loafing {{said that while}} Rabbit Fur Coat [...] "glided through an Appalachian dream world", Lewis [...] "stomps her boots while exploring similar terrain" [...] on Acid Tongue. The review continued that while the album [...] "includes plenty of quirky meditations on lost love that recall her previous adventures, [...] well-placed jolts give Acid Tongue greater balance, a component that's lacking on Rabbit Fur Coat." [...] According to The Sunday Times, [...] "the results are magnificent, [...] but occasionally they are a shaky misstep." [...] Chicago Sun-Times writer Jim DeRogatis called Acid Tongue [...] "sensual and entrancing." [...] The Daily Trojan labeled the tracks as [...] "psychedelic, occasionally sexy, but always timeless", although noting that the album [...] "lacks a thematic <b>focus</b> <b>that</b> {{can be found on}} every other album Lewis has released".|$|E

500|$|Prior to the 2003 season, {{he worked}} with Tony Gwynn on skills at the plate, {{predominantly}} using the whole field and being more of a [...] "slap hitter". However, he began the season slowly, sustaining a hamstring injury in spring training that hindered his progress, and ultimately struggling at the plate early in the season, causing manager Larry Bowa to drop him in the lineup. Throughout the season, he sought to maintain the <b>focus</b> <b>that</b> he admitted to having lost the previous season, and he eventually rebounded to post a [...] "respectable" [...] stat line – a [...]263 batting average with eight home runs and 62 RBIs, although he stole what {{at the time was}} a career-low 20 bases. Among his season highlights were a game-winning RBI against John Smoltz in June, and stealing his 100th career base in September, both of which occurred in games against the Atlanta Braves.|$|E
500|$|Kapoor's objects often aim {{to evoke}} {{immateriality}} and the spiritual, an outcome he achieves either by carving dark voids into stone pieces, or more recently, through the sheer shine and reflectivity of his objects. This Indian artist's works have no fixed identity, but rather occupy an illusionary space {{that is consistent}} with eastern theologies shared by Buddhism, Hinduism and Taoism, as well as Albert Einstein's views of a non-three-dimensional world. Kapoor explores the theme of ambiguity with his works that place the viewer in a state of [...] "in-betweenness". The artist often questions and plays with such dualities as solidityemptiness or realityreflection, which in turn allude to such paired opposites as fleshspirit, the herethe beyond, eastwest, skyearth, etc. that create the conflict between internal and external, superficial and subterranean, and conscious and unconscious. Kapoor also creates a tension between masculine and feminine within his art by having concave points of <b>focus</b> <b>that</b> invite the entry of visitors and multiplies their images when they are positioned correctly.|$|E
500|$|The {{music critic}} Harold Schonberg surmises that had Bizet lived, {{he might have}} revolutionised French opera; as it is, verismo was taken up mainly by Italians, notably Puccini who, {{according}} to Dean, developed the idea [...] "till it became threadbare". Bizet founded no specific school, though Dean names Chabrier and Ravel as composers influenced by him. Dean also suggests that a fascination with Bizet's tragic heroes—Frédéri in L'Arlésienne, José in Carmen—is reflected in Tchaikovsky's late symphonies, particularly the B minor [...] "Pathetique". Macdonald writes that Bizet's legacy {{is limited by the}} shortness of his life and by the false starts and lack of <b>focus</b> <b>that</b> persisted until his final five years. [...] "The spectacle of great works unwritten either because Bizet had other distractions, or because no one asked him to write them, or because of his premature death, is infinitely dispiriting, yet the brilliance and the individuality of his best music is unmistakable. It has greatly enriched a period of French music already rich in composers of talent and distinction." ...|$|E
