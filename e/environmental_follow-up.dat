40|$|Were {{the results}} as intended?" The {{question}} encapsulates {{the main purpose}} of environmental follow-ups of road and railway projects. Documenting how far the real environmental effects and consequences agree with those that were described in the environmental impact assessment (EIA) is {{the main purpose of}} an <b>environmental</b> <b>follow-up.</b> Another of its purposes is to identify unforeseen effects and consequences, so that appropriate countermeasures can be taken. Describing the extent to which any adaptive or mitigation measures had the desired effect may be yet a further purpose of making an <b>environmental</b> <b>follow-up.</b> An <b>environmental</b> <b>follow-up</b> can also aim to describe whether the environmental consequences of the infrastructure project was kept within the framework laid down at the time the investment decision was made. This overview reports how an EIA follow-up is organised and carried out in other countries, principally Norway, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, the USA, Canada, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong. Procedures are presented for selecting infrastructure projects to follow up, together with the environmental effects that are to be followed up. The importance of clarifying the purpose of the follow-up is emphasised, as is the importance of the follow-up activities being carried out according to a defined programme. Among other things, the follow-up programme describes the various players' responsibilities, access to baseline data, the timing of the follow-up, the methods to be used, and how the results are to be reported and used. The overview also takes up the follow-up's linkage to an environmental management system. Examples are also given of a method known as adaptive environmental management. Finally, the review looks at how experience gained from follow-ups can be disseminated and transferred to the planning of future infrastructure projects. The review shows that inspiration for more effective approaches and methodology for EIA follow-ups in the road and railway sector can also be sought in experience from follow-ups in other sectors...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION. The town of Biancavilla (Sicily) was {{included}} in the National Priorities List of Contaminated Sites due to environmental dispersion of amphibole fibers owing to the extraction of materials from a local quarry. The present report summarizes results from several, hitherto unpublished, environmental surveys carried out in the area, as well as from published analyses of the chemistry and composition of fibers. METHODS. Data included here comprises environmental fiber concentrations by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) analysis in soil, indoor and outdoor air, personal monitoring, as well as a chemical characterization of the fibers. The full chemical structure and spectroscopic characterization of fibers were obtained through a multi-analytical approach: SEM-EDS, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), as well as Mössbauer (MS) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopies. RESULTS. Data analyzed provided a spatial and temporal picture of fiber concentrations in Biancavilla, and a qualitative assessment of population exposure. Results suggest that until 2000, the population had been exposed to high levels of amphibole fibers. Mitigation measures adopted since 2001, gradually reduced exposure levels to about 0. 10. 4 ff/l. Previous studies on fibrous amphiboles from Biancavilla reported considerable chemical variability. Differences in composition, especially concerning the presence of Si, Ca, Fe, and Na, were found both within and between samples. Compared to the previously investigated prismatic fluoro-edenite, these fibrous fluorine amphiboles consistently showed higher average values of Si and Fe content, whereas Ca was significantly lower, which we consider a distinctive characteristic of the fluorine fibrous variety. CONCLUSIONS. The population of Biancavilla had been highly exposed to a suite of fibrous amphiboles for over 50 years. Dust mitigation measures have gradually reduced exposure, but continuous <b>environmental</b> <b>follow-up</b> is necessary in order to monitor exposure levels and prevent adverse health effects for future generations...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to conduct <b>environmental</b> <b>follow-up</b> {{assessment}} services for children with elevated blood lead levels (those identified by the Escambia County Health Department, ECHD, from 1999 - 2001 screenings, and any new cases identified by the ECHD during the project period), to complement other components of case management. The availability of no-cost lead assessment services was communicated to target households by letters, and to {{the community at large}} through news media and multiple community partners. Nevertheless, voluntary participation in this program was relatively low presumably because of potential consequences of finding lead contamination in homes (e. g., owner liability, costs of remediation, displacement of tenants), frequent movement of target individuals among rented dwellings, and general apathy. Consequently, this assessment was limited to 33 homes built before 1979 in the Escambia County. Analyses of paint chips, soil, and wipe samples showed that 21. 2 % of the tested homes had lead 2 contamination levels above the HUD guidelines for one or more samples, whereas 51. 5 % of the homes had detectable levels of lead contamination. Regardless of the level of lead contamination found, each of the study participants was provided with education materials and contact information for additional advice on dealing with lead hazards. Specific recommendations were made to the study participants, ranging from extensive building replacement to interim controls and inexpensive ways to maintain a clean home, so as to reduce lead hazards in the home. The findings from the present study, along with the City of Pensacola HUD program data indicating a cumulative lead prevalence between 50 - 55 % above HUD guidelines and 80 % with detectable levels of lead contamination, suggest that continued education and lead screening of homes and children would be beneficial for the reduction of lead hazards and improvements in community health...|$|E
40|$|Children aged 1 - 5 years {{enrolled}} in Medicaid are {{at increased risk}} for having elevated blood lead levels (BLLs). According to estimates from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (1991 - 1994), Medicaid enrollees accounted for 83 % of U. S. children aged 1 - 5 years who had BLLs > or = 20 microg/dL. Despite longstanding requirements for blood lead screening in the Medicaid program, an estimated 81 % of young children {{enrolled in}} Medicaid had not been screened with a blood lead test. As a result, most children with elevated BLLs are not identified and, therefore, do not receive appropriate treatment or environmental intervention. To ensure delivery of blood lead screening and follow-up services for young children enrolled in Medicaid, the Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention (ACCLPP) recommends specific steps for health-care providers and states. Health-care providers and health plans should provide blood lead screening and diagnostic and treatment services for children enrolled in Medicaid, consistent with federal law, and refer children with elevated BLLs for environmental and public health follow-up services. States should change policies and programs to ensure that young children enrolled in Medicaid receive the screening and follow-up services to which they are legally entitled. Toward this end, states should a) ensure that their own Medicaid policies comply with federal requirements, b) support health-care providers and health plans in delivering screening and follow-up services, and c) ensure that children identified with elevated BLLs receive essential, yet often overlooked, <b>environmental</b> <b>follow-up</b> care. States should also monitor screening performance and BLLs among young children enrolled in Medicaid. Finally, states should implement innovative blood lead screening strategies in areas where conventional screening services have been insufficient. This report provides recommendations for improved screening strategies and relevant background information for health-care providers, state health officials, and other persons interested in improving the delivery of lead-related services to young children served by Medicaid.

40|$|Summary: In {{this article}} we explore a {{continuum}} of interventions that offer at-risk children and youth experience in outdoor wilderness environments. Though these experiences are thought to enhance the well-being of participants, the mechanisms by which programming in natural environments promotes health have been poorly understood. In {{this article we}} discuss different types of outdoor programmes in which social workers and allied professionals participate, linking programme goals and outcomes to research on mitigating risk and promoting resilience in at-risk populations. • Findings: Findings are based on qualitative data gathered as part of regular programme evaluations and a separate study of 14 participants’ reactions to programming. Results show favourable outcomes in terms of relationship building {{and a sense of}} spirituality and purpose, though there was little increased awareness of <b>environmental</b> issues. <b>Follow-up</b> and support after programming helped to reinforce changes made during the outdoor experience. • Applications: These case studies, combined with a review of the literature, provide the basis for a theoretically sound approach to understanding the health-enhancing mechanisms that operate through outdoor experience-based education and treatment.

40|$|Introduction: Despite the {{advantages}} of using a hearing aid (HA), only 1 out of 5 individuals who could benefit from a (HA) actually use one (World Health Organization, 2012). If an individual does not use a HA then it may impact on their quality of life, {{as well as others}} around them (Chia et al., 2007). Therefore {{it is important to understand}} why individuals do not use HAs after obtaining them. To date, there has been no study that investigates the reasons for HA disuse in the New Zealand population. Methods: Two groups of adults with hearing impairment were recruited: HA users (N = 35) and HA disusers (N = 35). Six self-report questionnaires, three audiometric tests and two other body function measures were compared between the groups. Results: Several variables differentiated HA users from disusers, these significant variables were: cognition, understanding speech in noise, acceptance of noise, age at testing, education, hearing assistance technology (HAT) use, HA satisfaction, self-efficacy, accepted need, application for HA subsidy, HA outcomes, stages-of-change, perceived <b>environmental</b> influence, <b>follow-up</b> support and hearing related activity limitations/participation restrictions (AL/PR). Discussion: The clinical value of identifying factors related to HA disuse is so clinicians can identify “red flags” for disuse before the client stops using their HAs.

The findings from the interviews confirm that regional variation in follow-up implementation is a result of social, environmental, economical and political factors. To further explore these factors, three case studies of open cast coal mining were conducted. The findings of the case studies offer insight as to how the factors identified during the interviews influence follow-up outcomes. Furthermore, it reflects how the nature of such variation is not always true to what is perceived about them.

The study is a population-based historical follow-up using the Danish Medical Birth registry, hospital discharge diagnoses, and Statistic Denmark's Fertility Database. The investigators identified 8, 671 women who gave birth to a child with a diagnosed malformation between 1980 and 1992 and had a subsequent birth. Following the birth of an affected infant, 474 (5. 5 %) women gave birth to another child with a malformation, 155 of which (1. 8 %) were similar to the malformation of the older sib or half sib. When the father changed between the two births, the risk of a similar anomaly was significantly reduced (odds ratio (OR) = 0. 26, 95 % confidence interval (Cl) 0. 11, 0. 65). Higher social status at enrollment was associated with a lower recurrence risk (OR = 0. 67, 95 % Cl 0. 45, 0. 99, for the middle status group and OR = 0. 49, 95 % Cl 0. 30, 0. 81, for the highest status group), independently of partner change. A rise in social status between the two births was marginally associated with a decline in the recurrence risk.

It reviews the literature and studies EIA legislation, administrative procedures, guidelines, and relevant documents by using a model proposed by Leu et al. (1996) and applying criteria proposed by Wood (1995) to evaluate the performance of EIA systems. Key EIA legislation in Lao PDR has many strengths, but also major weaknesses: Inadequate planning procedures, no secondary regulations, few trained and skilled personnel, inadequate public consultation, lack of <b>environmental</b> data, weak <b>follow-up</b> and monitoring, and no enforcement machinery. Additionally, the EIA approval procedure is very bureaucratic and easily derailed by political and economic pressures. In addition, coordination among EIA proponents, consultants, concerned ministries, local authorities, planners, and decision-makers is generally weak. This delays decision-making and hinders implementation of environmental regulations. Thus, procedures and evaluation are not always performed well. EIAs are more a project justification tool than a project planning tool for sustainable development. We conclude with recommendations to strengthen the system, such as improving capacity building, implementing an EIA consultants’ accreditation system, ensuring effective public participation and access to EIA reports, applying systematic EIAs, reviewing criteria, and promoting environmental awareness. </p...|$|R
40|$|Acquiring {{language}} {{is understood to}} be a key part of a child’s development (Siraj-Blatchford & Clarke, 2003), impacting skills including literacy and behaviour. The number of children identified as having speech, language and communication needs has been increasing by 4 - 6 percent each year since 2011 and is the most common primary need of children with on the SEN register (Whitaker, 2014). Early intervention is argued to have the greatest impact on the outcomes for children, as well as being the most cost-effective (Law et al., 2001). However, there has been a call to improve the provision for children with these needs due to the variability of the provision children receive (Bercow, 2008). Due to the diverse workforce, as well as the recognised importance of practitioners viewpoints, there has been a call for research into the viewpoints of early years practitioners regarding strategies to support children with SLCN (Marshall & Lewis, 2014). The present research uses a Q methodological research approach (Stephenson, 1953) to explore the viewpoints of 42 early years practitioners on strategies to support children with speech, language and communication needs. Q methodology utilises the advantages of both qualitative and quantitative research methods and creates open communication around complex topics in order to clarify participants’ views and explore subjective and diverse viewpoints. The data generated by Q methodology was analysed using a by-person factor analysis. Three distinct viewpoints were identified within the group of early years practitioners who participated in the research.

The report was ultimately concluded to be a Human Rights Assessment, because assessors could not contrast baseline with change to establish impacts. The assessors {{also noted that the}} report could not be considered an impact assessment because the most significantly impacted rightsholder group, the Sipacapa people, were not interviewed or engaged during the assessment process. The methodology used by On Common Ground, as the document states, incorporated the Danish Institute's Compliance Assessment.

Assessors conducted thoughtful analysis of the tools, standards, and guides used and were reflective of the report's strengths and weaknesses. Commissioned years after production (and community revolt) had begun at the mine, local conditions and project design had all changed drastically by the time assessors arrived. Further complicating the assessment, the mine’s EIA was faulty and peppered with gaps.

Permit conditions of twenty-one environmental authorisations were examined and tested for conformance with legislated requirements, and practicality of monitoring for compliance (monitorability). It was found that there are many contributors to achieving monitorable permit conditions. Amongst the most significant of these are conformity in interpretation of the regulations specifying permit content by officials, gaps in guidance {{on the part of the}} regulations themselves, and a tendency to focus on construction related impacts. The lack of clarity regarding the roles and functions of environmental control officer and environmental auditor further contribute to poor monitorability of permit conditions.

Paper I reviews the use of environmental compensation in Germany, the USA, the Netherlands, the UK and Sweden. Paper II examines 15 planned Swedish road projects in order to investigate the intended use of environmental compensation. Paper III is a case study consisting of two road projects that have shown that proposed environmental compensation measures have been rather successful, in terms of getting described in the legally binding documents. The thesis concludes that environmental compensation is a potentially useful tool for a sustainable road planning. It is an instrument that is rather easy to use in the existing road planning system {{as a part of the}} EIA process. Municipalities and organisations have a rather positive attitude to compensation. Nevertheless, there are misgivings that environmental compensation can be misused by undermining the environmental consideration in projects. Hence it is of vital importance that the SRA clearly shows that environmental compensation is the third step in environmental consideration after avoidance and mitigation. The thesis highlights the importance of several factors important for a more successful use of environmental compensation in road planning. The interest and knowledge of professionals, especially project managers, is a crucial success factor. The legal context for environmental compensation also needs to be discussed more. Furthermore check lists that guarantee <b>environmental</b> measures, <b>follow-up</b> studies and better knowledge about environmental compensation are emphasised as important factors. Another conclusion is that environmental compensation can be used as a tool to create new environmental values in the everyday landscape, for example ecological networks...|$|R
40|$|Abridged) We {{consider}} the scientific {{case for a}} large aperture (10 - 12 m class) optical spectroscopic survey telescope with a field of view {{comparable to that of}} LSST. Such a facility could enable transformational progress in several areas of astrophysics, and may constitute an unmatched capability for decades. Deep imaging from LSST and Euclid will provide accurate photometry for spectroscopic targets beyond the reach of 4 m class instruments. Such a facility would revolutionise our understanding of the assembly and enrichment history of the Milky Way and the role of dark matter through chemo-dynamical studies of tens of millions of stars in the Local Group. Emission and absorption line spectroscopy of redshift z= 2 - 5 galaxies can be used to directly chart the evolution of the cosmic web and examine its connection with activity in galaxies. The facility will also have synergistic impact, e. g. in following up live and transpired transients found with LSST, as well as providing targets and the local <b>environmental</b> conditions for <b>follow-up</b> studies with E-ELT and future space missions. Although our study is exploratory, we highlight a specific telescope design with a 5 square degree field of view and an additional focus that could host a next-generation panoramic IFU. We discuss some technical challenges and operational models and recommend a conceptual design study aimed at completing a more rigorous science case {{in the context of a}} costed technical design. Comment: 50 pages including Appendices, 12 figures. One of several reports, commissioned internally at ESO, taking a first look at possible future projects for the era beyond E-ELT constructio...|$|R
40|$|<b>Environmental</b> impact {{assessment}} <b>follow-up</b> {{has been widely}} addressed by various researchers. However, {{there is still a}} gap in the actual implementation of this process. This study addresses this gap by evaluating the effectiveness of implementing the environmental authorizations of Eskom’s Kusile and Medupi Power Stations during the construction phase. The main aim of the study is to determine whether the environmental authorization conditions were effectively implemented by project developers and whether full compliance which could lead towards sustainable development was at the forefront of Kusile and Medupi developments. The survey method was used whereby questionnaires were formulated and completed by fifty (50) participants involved in the implementation of both power stations’ environmental authorizations. The results showed that the importance of protecting the environment and overall compliance with the projects’ environmental authorization conditions are well understood and implemented. However, some of the responses indicated the difficulty in implementing certain environmental authorization conditions such as retaining existing vegetation cover. About Nineteen (19) external audit reports (of which nine were for Kusile and ten for Medupi) between the periods of 2008 to 2014 were reviewed and the audit results shown good percentage of over 90 % compliance with the environmental authorization at both power stations. In conclusion, the environmental authorizations were well implemented by both Kusile and Medupi Power Stations. The environmental management through compliance with the environmental authorization is {{at the forefront of the}} Eskom’s developments and thus promotes sustainable development. The outcome of this study has a wide application that includes application to any new project that involves building infrastructure. Environmental SciencesM. Sc. (Environmental Management...|$|R
40|$|The {{northern}} Great Plains of Saskatchewan {{is one of}} {{the most}} significantly modified landscapes in Canada. While the majority of anthropogenic disturbance to Saskatchewan’s grasslands is the result of agricultural practices, oil and gas activity are of increasing concern to grassland conservation efforts. Although such developments require formal regulatory approval (<b>Environmental</b> Impact Assessment), <b>follow-up</b> and monitoring of the effects of oil and gas development on grasslands is not common practice. In the absence of empirical based follow-up and monitoring, the actual environmental effects of petroleum and natural gas (PNG) development on grassland ecology and the spatial extent of development are largely unknown. This thesis examines the spatial and temporal extent of PNG development and its effects on grassland ecology within a PFRA (Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration) pasture in southwest Saskatchewan. The extent of the changes to infrastructure and the actual impacts from development within the study area were documented from 1955 to 2006. The actual impacts of oil and gas activity on grassland ecology were determined by analyzing ground cover characteristics, soil properties, and community composition at lease sites and compared to reference pasture sites. Associated with construction practices, lease sites had low herbaceous, Lycopodiaceae, litter, organic horizon (Ah) thickness, and soil compaction values. Lease sites were also found to have low desirable species diversity, range health values, and greater undesirable species presence. Impacts from development were amplified at active, highly productive lease sites. The impacts associated with PNG development were also found to persist for more than 50 years, and extend 20 m – 25 m beyond the physical footprint of infrastructure. This research will contribute to monitoring and mitigation measures for oil and gas development within Saskatchewan and Canadian grasslands...|$|R
40|$|The SNCA/alpha-synuclein p. A 53 T {{mutation}} segregating in the Contursi kindred was {{the first}} mutation ever described in inherited Parkinson’s disease (PD). 1, 2 We directly examined 10 subjects (4 PD patients and 6 asymptomatic relatives) of {{a branch of the}} Contursi kindred. We also collected data on 11 members affected by history, through interviews and inspection of available medical records. Nine had died in the fourth to seventh decade diagnosed with PD (plus psychiatric features in 3), whereas 2 were reported to have severe psychiatric disturbances and were unavailable for examination. After obtaining ethics approval and written informed consent, all subjects underwent a complete neurological examination (see Video 1) and SNCA p. A 53 T mutation testing. The 4 PD patients (age, 4269. 8 years), and 2 unaffected individuals (age, 29. 562. 1 years) resulted as heterozygous for the mutation. Two affected (III: 1, IV: 1) and 2 unaffected (IV: 2, IV: 6) carriers also underwent extensive neuropsychological and psychiatric assessment, olfaction evaluation, and dopamine transporter imaging with single-photon emission computed tomography (DAT-SPECT); 3 T brain MRI was performed in 3 subjects (III: 1, IV: 2, and IV: 6; Fig. 1). Although the overall phenotype in the 4 patients was typical of SNCA-related PD with early, asymmetric onset, initial good response to dopaminergic therapy and early motor complications, 3 a relevant variability was observed in the combination and severity of motor symptoms (partially responding to levodopa and DBS in III- 9) and nonmotor features (Table 1). Age at onset varied from 26 to 48 years (mean, 32. 7610. 5), with longer disease duration than previously reported (from 2 to 19 years; mean, 9. 268. 5). Cognitive deficits were present in all 4 patients, ranging from frank dementia in those with longer disease duration (III- 8, III- 9) to moderate cognitive impairment (III- 1) or slight isolated executive dysfunction (IV- 1) in those with a shorter one. Depression and anxiety were detected in 3 patients, behavioral disorders in 2, and dysautonomia in 2. Olfaction was impaired in both tested patients. Although the variable severity could depend on the different disease duration, the wide range of ages at onset among carriers of the same genetic mutation remains unexplained, suggesting the existence of yet unknown environmental, genetic, and/or epigenetic modifiers. 4 Interestingly, 2 asymptomatic carriers, ages 31 and 28 years, were clinically unaffected. Their general cognitive functions were normal and they did not refer any sleep or mood disorder. However, the younger one (IV: 2) presented an objective olfactory deficit and an abnormal DAT scan, suggesting an underlying, still subclinical, neurodegenerative process. The existence of SNCA mutation carriers who remain clinically asymptomatic at ages beyond the expected age of onset has been reported, implying reduced penetrance. 5 However, our carriers were still younger than the latest age of onset in the family; therefore, any conclusion would be merely speculative and further clinical follow-up is necessary. In conclusion, our data further highlight the relevant intrafamilial phenotypic variability in carriers of the SNCA p. A 53 T mutation, suggesting a role for yet unknown genetic or <b>environmental</b> modifiers. <b>Follow-up</b> studies are encouraged to better define the clinical spectrum of PD caused by SNCA gene mutations...|$|R

The following results had been obtained and published in the literature: Bradder cancer: Numericalalterations on chromosome 7, 9, and 17 by dual-color fruorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) demonstrated that chromosome 7 trisomy and 9 monosomy were the most frequently occurred not only in the tumor, but also in the surrounding intact bladder mucosa, and that 9 monosomy detected by using negative cytology specimen could predict early recurrence of superficial bladder cancer. Chromosome 17 p 13. 1 region, on which p 53 gene was located, was studied by using cosmid probe, and deletion of these regions had a striking impact on the functional loss of tumor suppresor function in invasive bladder cancer. Immunohistochemical staining of p 53 showed clinical significance in predicting patient prognosis in bladder cancer. Prostate cancer: Studies on chromosomal deletion of 8 p 22, 23 -pter, 10 q 24 -qter, and 16 q 24 demonstrated that 8 p deletion had close association with tumor stage as well as pathological grade. Further investigation on Japanese prostate cancer suggested that putative tumor suppressor genes are located on 8 p 21. 1 - 21. 2 and 21. 3 - 22. Collaborative studies with Karolinska Institute were published that 16 q 24 deletion had signficant relation to metastatic ability in prostage cancer, and sporadic prostate cancer arose from mutual influence of those genomic alterations with <b>environmental</b> factors. Further <b>follow-up</b> study proved deletion on 8 p 22 to a universal genetic marker for disease progression in Japanese prostage cancer as well as Swedish. Renal cell carcinoma: FISH studies on 5 q 22. 3 - 23. 2 demonstrated that gain and loss of 5 q 22. 3 - 23. 2 were predictive genetic marker for favorable and unfavorable patient outcome, respectively in renal cell carcinoma. Cases with 3 p loss, the most frequent alteration in renal cell carcinoma, in association with 8 q 24 (c-myc) gain was significantly higher in high stage tumor. Genetic mapping on chromosome 9 using satellite marker showed frequent deletion in PTCH gene located on 9 q 22...|$|R

However, the considerations and the adequacy of the protection of the environment through specialized environmental legislation away from the legal rules contained in the civil law or criminal law are the other has become a subject of question, especially since these environmental legislation require the formulation and framing the contents addressed to environmental problems and crises lot of considerations that unless materialize in various stages of age and environmental legislation during the amendment or repeal, this legislation did not become influential in strengthening the legal protection of the environment channels. The thus ensuring the effectiveness of environmental legislation through to ensure the application of this legislation in the preventive side and therapeutic legal tools do executive and judicial organs specialized knowledge of minute details of environmental problems and how to reduce them within the framework of legal protection, especially since observed that the majority of environmental legislation bother beside specialized in the administrative side more so in the interest of judicial side. By extrapolating the analysis of environmental legislation in the GCC is clear that there is a disparity in many aspects of the framing of the criminal and civil protection of the environment through environmental legislation of each country separately, and in terms of extension of time or in terms of the legal aspects of the protection planned for the environment in different ranges, and in accordance with considerations associated maturely awareness side under the auspices of the environment on one hand, and according to what is associated with the specificity of each country separately from the other side, as that given to the respect of the administrative exactly setting judicial legislation cooperation Council (GCC), it is clear that there is a difference in the powers and mechanisms for the implementation of environmental legislation, and the scope of the powers of the administrative and judicial authorities in the control and <b>follow-up</b> <b>environmental</b> crimes each country separately...|$|R
