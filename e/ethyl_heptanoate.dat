50|$|Propyl hexanoate (C9H18O2), {{also known}} as propyl caproate, is an ester formed by the {{reaction}} of propanol with hexanoic acid. Although it is a completely different ester, propyl hexanoate shares the same chemical formula with methyl octanoate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>heptanoate,</b> butyl pentanoate, etc. because they {{all have the same}} total carbon chain length. The scent of this ester can be described as that of blackberries, pineapple, cheese or wine.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} probed into the degree of chemosensory detection additivity exhibited by mixtures of <b>ethyl</b> propanoate and <b>heptanoate</b> {{in terms of their}} trigeminal detectability via nasal pungency (i. e., irritation) and eye irritation. Nasal pungency was tested in subjects lacking a functional sense of smell (i. e., anosmics) to avoid olfactory biases. First, we built concentration-detection functions for each chemical and sensory endpoint. Second, we used the data from the functions to prepare mixtures of the two compounds in complementary proportions, and suitable single-chemical standards, all of which should be equally detectable under a rule of complete additivity, i. e., independence of detection. Third, we compared the experimentally obtained detectability with that expected under such rule. The outcome revealed that, at a low detectability level (but still above chance), the mixtures showed complete additivity for both trigeminal endpoints. At a high detectability level (but below perfect detection), the mixtures showed complete additivity for nasal pungency but less than complete additivity for eye irritation. In the context of previous studies, the results consolidate a picture of higher degree of detection additivity at perithreshold levels in trigeminal than in olfactory chemoreception. The outcome presents another line of evidence suggesting broader chemical tuning in chemesthesis compared to olfaction...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Numerous {{investigations}} {{have been made}} on the contribution of butter cultures to the flavor of cultured cream butter, but production of uniform cultured cream butter has not been possible in industry. Therefore, it was desirable to investigate in detail the qualitative and quantitative chemistry of the flavor of high quality butter cultures, and to examine more closely some of the aspects of flavor production by butter culture organisms. Volatile flavor components of high quality butter culture and control heated milk were isolated from intact samples {{by means of a}} specially designed low-temperature, reduced-pressure steam distillation apparatus. Most of the flavor compounds present in the resulting distillate fractions were tentatively identified by gas chromatographic relative retention time data. Flavor concentrates obtained by ethyl ether extractions of aqueous distillates were also separated by temperature-programmed, capillary column gas chromatography, and the effluent from the capillary column was analyzed by a fast- scan mass spectrometer. Many of the flavor compounds in the flavor concentrates were positively identified by correlation of mass spectral and gas chromatographic data. In addition, supporting evidence for the identification of some flavor components was obtained through the use of qualitative functional group reagents, derivatives and headspace gas chromatography. Compounds that were positively identified in butter culture include ethanol, acetone, ethyl formate, methyl acetate, acetaldehyde, diacetyl, ethyl acetate, dimethyl sulfide, butanone, 2 -butanol, methyl butyrate, ethyl butyrate, methane, methyl chloride, carbon dioxide and methanol; also included were 2 -pentanone, 2 -heptanone, acetoin, formic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, 2 -furfural, 2 -furfurol, methyl hexanoate, ethyl hexanoate, 2 -nonanone, 2 -undecanone, methyl octanoate and ethyl octanoate. Compounds that were tentatively identified in butter culture include hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, n-butanal, n-butanol, 2 -hexanone, n-pentanal, n-pentanol, 2 -mercaptoethanol, n-butyl formate, n-butyl acetate, 2 -methylbutanal, 3 -methylbutanal, methylpropanal, methyl heptanoate, n-octanal, 2 -tridecanone, methyl benzoate, methyl nonanoate, ethyl nonanoate, ethyl decanoate, methyl dodecanoate, ethyl dodecanoate, delta-octalactone and delta-decalactone. Compounds that were positively identified in control heated milk include acetaldehyde, ethyl formate, ethyl acetate, 2 -heptanone, 2 -furfural, 2 -furfurol, 2 -nonanone, 2 -undecanone, ethyl octanoate and methyl decanoate. Compounds that were tentatively identified in control heated milk include dimethyl sulfide, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, methyl mercaptan, methyl acetate, acetone, methanol, butanone, butanal, n-butanol, methyl butyrate, ethyl butyrate, 2 -pentanone, 2 -hexanone, 2 -mercaptoethanol, 2 -furfuryl acetate, <b>ethyl</b> hexanoate, methyl <b>heptanoate,</b> 2 -tridecanone, <b>ethyl</b> decanoate, ethyl dodecanoate, delta-octalactone and delta-decalactone. The data indicated that the qualitative flavor composition of control heated milk and butter culture were very similar. Diacetyl, ethanol, 2 -butanol and acetic acid were noted to be consistently absent in the data for the control heated milk. Other compounds were not observed in the heated milk fractions, but were also absent from some of the culture fractions. This was attributed to their presence in low concentrations, chemical instability or inefficient recovery. A modified 3 -methyl- 2 -benzothiazolone hydrazone spectrophotometric procedure was adapted for the determination of acetaldehyde produced in lactic starter cultures. The procedure was applied in conjunction with diacetyl measurements in studying single- and mixed-strain lactic cultures. The diacetyl to acetaldehyde ratio was found to be approximately 4 : 1 in desirably flavored mixed-strain butter cultures. When the ratio of the two compounds was lower than 3 : 1 a green flavor was observed. Acetaldehyde utilization at 21 °C by Leuconostoc citrovorum 91404 was very rapid in both acidified (pH 4. 5) and non-acidified (pH 6. 5) milk cultures. The addition of five p. p. m. of acetaldehyde to non-acidified milk media prior to inoculation greatly enhanced growth of L. citrovorum 91404 during incubation at 21 °C. Combinations of single-strain organisms demonstrated that the green flavor defect can result from excess numbers of Streptococcus lactis or Streptococcus diacetilactis in relation to the L. citrovorum population. Diacetyl, dimethyl sulfide, acetaldehyde, acetic acid and carbon dioxide were found to be "key" compounds in natural butter culture flavor. Optimum levels of these compounds in butter culture were ascertained by chemical or flavor panel evaluations. On the basis of these determinations, a synthetic butter culture prepared with heated whole milk and delta-gluconolactone (final pH 4. 65) was flavored with 2. 0 p. p. m. of diacetyl, 0. 5 p. p. m. of acetaldehyde, 1250 p. p. m. of acetic acid, 25. 0 p. p. b. of dimethyl sulfide and a small amount of sodium bicarbonate for production of carbon dioxide. The resulting synthetic butter culture exhibited the typical aroma, flavor and body characteristics found in natural high quality butter cultures, except that the delta-gluconolactone was found to contribute an astringent flavor...|$|R

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{explored the}} olfactory detectability of two chemically and structurally similar esters, ethyl propanoate and <b>ethyl</b> <b>heptanoate,</b> presented singly and in mixtures. Initially, we measured concentration-detection (i. e., psychometric) functions for {{the odor of}} ethyl propanoate and <b>ethyl</b> <b>heptanoate</b> presented singly. Using this information, we prepared binary mixtures of the two chemicals in varying complementary proportions and, also, selected concentrations of the single compounds, such that, if a rule of response-addition (i. e., independence of detection) were to hold, the stimuli (mixed and single) should approximate equal detection. Next, we measured the actual detectability of these stimuli within the same experiment. The results were analyzed in terms of response-addition (or -additivity) and of dose-addition (or -additivity). The outcome revealed that at low levels of detectability the mixtures approximate response-addition, that is, independence of detection, whereas at high levels of detectability they approximate dose-addition. In the light of previous findings for the olfactory detection of the more dissimilar chemical pairs 1 -butanol/ 2 -heptanone and butyl acetate/toluene, we conclude that the described outcome generalizes {{across a variety of}} chemical pairs.

40|$|Changes in the {{aromatic}} composition {{as well as}} {{sensory characteristics}} in Verdejo white wines were analysed based on two factors: the winemaking methodology and the storing time of wine in bottles. The volatile components were determined by GLC-MS, and the sensory profile was designed and assessed according to the ISO 11035 standard. The results showed that when wines were made in oak barrels, either completely or partially, which means the wines were {{in contact with the}} lees, the levels of 1 -octanol, <b>ethyl</b> <b>heptanoate</b> and ethyl decanoate were significantly affected (P menor que 0. 05); the softness sensation was also influenced (P menor que 0. 05). However, the amount of time the wines were stored in bottles significantly affected (P menor que 0. 05) the levels of 1 -hexanol, <b>ethyl</b> <b>heptanoate,</b> ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate, hexyl acetate, isoamyl acetate and isoamyl lactate and also an odour note (tropical fruit). The compounds with higher OAV values belong to the groups of esters and fatty acids.

40|$|The {{aroma of}} the three {{different}} classes of Sherry vinegar was evaluated by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography/olfactometry (GC-O). GC-O was employed to identify substances responsible for aromatic notes associated with the selected descriptors of the typical aroma of Sherry vinegar and odor activity values (OAV) calculated to measure the single impact effect of different compounds selected by GC-O. Diacetyl, isoamyl acetate, ethyl isobutyrate, isovaleric acid, sotolon, and ethyl acetate reached high OAVs, {{turning out to be}} characteristic odor active compounds in Sherry vinegars.

40|$|International audienceTo date, most of {{the sensory}} studies {{concerning}} off-flavors focus on ă their detection or rejection thresholds. However, both supra and ă sub-threshold concentrations of off-flavor components may change the ă perception of odorous mixtures. In this context, {{the aim of this}} study ă was to determine the impact of infra- and supra-threshold concentrations ă of a wine defect, ``Bretty'' character (ethylphenols), on the wine ă fruity note. Techniques used included sensory analysis (odor profiling), ă psychophysical tests (threshold measurements), and chemical analyses ă (GCMS). The sensory test panels consisted of wine experts. The results ă showed that both sub- and supraliminal concentrations of off-flavors ă could interfere with the perception of fruity notes. In addition, the ă findings revealed that this wine defect not only changes the hedonic ă valence of the perception, but also has a masking effect on fruity ă notes, even at subliminal concentrations. The final experiment ă demonstrated that the interaction between the perception of ethylphenols ă and <b>ethyl</b> <b>heptanoate</b> takes place at a central locus in the olfactory ă system.

40|$|RAFFINAGE+CGEThrough a {{combined}} experimental and density functional study, we investigate the deoxygenation of <b>ethyl</b> <b>heptanoate</b> catalyzed by three relevant unsupported (bulk) transition metal sulfide catalysts: MoS 2, Ni 3 S 2 and Ni-promoted MoS 2 (with various Ni/Mo ratio). Two pathways compete for this reaction: hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) and decarboxylation/decarbonylation (DCO). It is shown experimentally {{that the presence}} of Ni either in the NiMoS mixed phase or in the Ni monosulfide phase may change the selectivity between the HDO and DCO pathway. To understand the origin of this selectivity, we study the deoxygenation pathways of two relevant intermediates: carboxylic acid and aldehyde. In particular, DFT calculations highlight that the aldehyde decarbonylation occurs via its dehydrogenation into the alkanoyl and/or ketene intermediates on the Ni 3 S 2 (111) surface. These pathways are found to be more favorable on Ni 3 S 2 than on MoS 2 -based catalysts. This trend is explained by the presence of Ni- 3 triangular facets on Ni 3 S 2 (111) enhancing the formation of the unsaturated alkanoyl and/or ketene intermediates as well as the CO product. We finally propose a detailed analysis of the promoting effect of Ni on MoS 2, when present in the NiMoS structure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe main {{objective}} of this work was to study and test the nature and influence of reaction media (organic solvent vs. miniemulsion system) on the synthesis of alkyl esters by Fusarium solani pisi cutinase. Ester synthesis and cutinase selectivity for different chain length of acids and alcohols (ethyl and hexyl) were evaluated. In iso-octane cutinase presents rates of esterification after one hour between 0. 24 μmolmg- 1 min- 1 for ethyl oleate and 1. 15 μmolmg- 1 min- 1 for ethyl butyrate, while in miniemulsion system were from 0. 05 μmolmg- 1 min- 1 for <b>ethyl</b> <b>heptanoate</b> to 0. 76 μmolmg- 1 min- 1 for ethyl decanoate.
