5|$|Ataxia {{released}} its second and final studio album, AW II in 2007. Following the Stadium Arcadium tour (early May 2006 to late August 2007), the Red Hot Chili Peppers {{agreed to a}} <b>hiatus</b> <b>of</b> indefinite length. In early 2008, Anthony Kiedis finally confirmed this, citing exhaustion from constant work since Californication as the main reason. Frusciante quit the group on July 29, 2009, but did not publicly announce his departure until December 2009, {{two months after the}} band ended their hiatus in October 2009 and began work on their next album with Josh Klinghoffer as their new guitarist.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the decade, {{alternative}} rock's mainstream prominence declined due to {{a number}} of events that caused grunge and Britpop to fade and led to the <b>hiatus</b> <b>of</b> the Lollapalooza festival. Nevertheless, post-grunge remained commercially viable into the start of the 21st century, with the commercial success of Creed and Matchbox Twenty; Radiohead's critical acclaim, and the success of some post-Britpop groups like Coldplay. Emo attracted attention in the larger alternative rock world, and the term was applied to a variety of artists, including multi-platinum acts. During the late 1990s and 2000s, other alternative rock bands emerged, including The White Stripes, The Strokes and Arcade Fire.|$|E

5|$|Calleia had {{his first}} real role as a heavy in Small Miracle, and his success in the play was {{responsible}} for his move to Hollywood. Calleia's contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer permitted him a <b>hiatus</b> <b>of</b> six months a year, to continue his stage work. He was not new to motion pictures—he had made three feature films on the East Coast—but when MGM put Calleia under contract they promoted his first film, Public Hero No. 1 (1935), as his screen debut. Calleia's portrayal of the gunman was listed by film critic Andre Sennwald of The New York Times {{as one of the}} year's ten best male performances.|$|E
5|$|Film {{production}} in the Indies declined after the Japanese occupation began in early 1942; the overlords forced all but one studio to close. In their place, the Japanese opened their own studio in the Indies, Nippon Eigasha, to produce propaganda for the war effort. Kartolo acted in the studio's only feature film, Berdjoang (Hope of the South), without Roekiah in 1943. After a <b>hiatus</b> <b>of</b> several years, Roekiah also acted for the studio, taking {{a role in the}} short Japanese propaganda film Ke Seberang (To the Other Side) in 1944. However, much of her time was spent touring Java with a theatrical company, entertaining Japanese troops.|$|E
5|$|Quiriguá {{suffered}} a hiatus from {{the turn of}} the 6th century that lasted through {{to the middle of the}} 7th century. This may be linked to the Tikal <b>hiatus</b> <b>of</b> the Middle Classic caused by Tikal's defeat by Calakmul. There is evidence that Quiriguá {{suffered a}}n attack by unknown enemies in this period, as demonstrated by the apparently deliberate defacement of Stela U and Monument26, characteristic of damage inflicted by invading warriors. No monuments were erected during this hiatus, which lasted from 495 to 653.|$|E

This was followed in 2011 by a novel by American author Jeffery Deaver, a 2013 book by William Boyd and a further instalment in September 2015 by Anthony Horowitz. There {{has also been a}} spin-off series of books, Young Bond, based around Bond's adventures whilst a schoolboy at Eton College.|$|E
5|$|Dangerously in Love is {{the debut}} solo studio album by American singer Beyoncé. It was {{released}} worldwide on June 24, 2003 through Columbia Records and Music World Entertainment {{and in the}} United Kingdom on June 23, 2003. During the recording of Destiny's Child's third studio album Survivor (2001), the group announced that they would produce solo albums to be released. Recording sessions for the album took place from March 2002 to March 2003 at several studios, during the <b>hiatus</b> <b>of</b> her then-group Destiny's Child. As {{executive producer of the}} album, Beyoncé took a wider role in its production, co-writing a majority of the songs, choosing which ones to produce and sharing ideas on the mixing and mastering of tracks.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian–British–Swedish Antarctic Expedition of 1949–52 was {{the first}} {{international}} scientific expedition in Antarctica. The expedition established its winter quarters at a base called Maudheim at 71°S, 11°W, and mapped much of western Queen Maud Land. During the International Geophysical Year (1957–1958), year-round stations were established in Queen Maud Land by Norway, the Soviet Union, Belgium and Japan. The Norwegian expedition continued with topographical mapping, while the others started geophysical and geological research. Norway's Norway Station was lent to South Africa following {{the withdrawal of the}} Norwegian expedition in 1960. South Africa later built the SANAE station, near the now-defunct Norway Station. The Soviet Union, and later Russia, has maintained continual operations, although it moved from Lazarev Station to Novolazarevskaya Station. Japan has been based at its Showa Station since 1957, except for a <b>hiatus</b> <b>of</b> a few years. Belgium closed its Roi Baudouin station in 1961, though it mounted limited operations in cooperation with the Netherlands in 1964–66. The United States established the temporary Plateau Station in 1966.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the interwar period, {{elements}} of the fleet conducted visits to ports throughout the Mediterranean, but few fleet exercises occurred due to budget pressures. In 1930, the Maritime Air Force was divorced from Royal Yugoslav Army control, and the naval air arm began to develop significantly, including the establishment of bases along the Adriatic coast. The following year, a British-made flotilla leader was commissioned {{with the idea that}} the KJRM might be able to operate in the Mediterranean Sea alongside the British and French navies. In the same year, five locally-built minelayers were added to the fleet. A <b>hiatus</b> <b>of</b> several years followed, and it was not until 1936 that any further major acquisitions were made, with the purchase of eight German-built MTBs. Over the next two years, the fleet was significantly strengthened by the acquisition of three French-designed destroyers, marking the high point of Yugoslav naval strength. On the eve of World War II, the navy consisted of 611 officers and 8,562 men, operating 41 combatant ships and 19 auxiliaries.|$|E

50|$|In media {{scheduling}} for {{seasonal product}} categories, flighting involves intermittent and irregular periods of advertising (flights), alternating with shorter periods (<b>hiatuses)</b> <b>of</b> no advertising at all. The main {{advantage of the}} flighting technique {{is that it allows}} an advertiser who does not have funds for running spots continuously to conserve money and maximize the impact of the commercials by airing them at key strategic times. Advertisers may employ less costly media such as radio or newspaper during a television flighting <b>hiatus.</b> This method <b>of</b> media planning allows the messages and themes of the advertising campaign to continue to reach consumers while conserving advertising funds.|$|R
