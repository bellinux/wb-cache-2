5|$|A reformist, Dunstan brought {{profound}} {{change to}} South Australian society. His socially progressive administration saw Aboriginal land rights recognised, homosexuality decriminalised, {{the first female}} judge appointed, the first non-British governor, Sir Mark Oliphant, and later, the first indigenous governor Sir Douglas Nicholls. He enacted consumer protection laws, reformed and expanded the public education and health systems, abolished the death penalty, relaxed censorship and drinking laws, created a ministry for the environment, enacted anti-discrimination law, and implemented electoral reforms such as the overhaul of the Legislative Council of parliament, lowered the voting age to 18, enacted universal suffrage, and completely abolished malapportionment, changes which gave him a less hostile parliament and allowed him to enact his reforms. He established Rundle Mall, enacted measures to protect buildings of historical heritage, and encouraged a flourishing of the arts, with support for the Adelaide Festival Centre, the State Theatre Company, {{and the establishment of}} the South Australian Film Corporation. He encouraged cultural exchanges with Asia, multiculturalism and an increase in the state's culinary awareness and sophistication. He is recognised for his role in reinvigorating the social, artistic and cultural life of South Australia during his nine years in office, remembered as the Dunstan Decade. However, there were also problems; the economy began to stagnate, and the large increases to burgeoning public service generated claims of waste. One of Dunstan's pet projects, a plan to build a new city at Monarto to alleviate urban pressures in Adelaide, was abandoned when economic and population growth stalled, with much money and planning already invested. After four consecutive election wins, Dunstan's administration began to falter in 1978 following his dismissal of Police Commissioner Harold Salisbury, as controversy broke out over whether he had improperly interfered with a <b>judicial</b> <b>investigation.</b> In addition, policy problems and unemployment began to mount, as well as unsubstantiated rumours of corruption and personal impropriety. Dunstan became increasingly short-tempered, and the strain was increased by the death of his second wife. His resignation from the premiership and politics in 1979 was abrupt after collapsing due to ill health, but he would live for another 20 years, remaining a vocal and outspoken campaigner for progressive social policy.|$|E

25|$|On his release, May {{continued}} his life of crime, impersonating various characters (policemen, doctors etc.) and spinning fantastic tales {{as a method}} of fraud. He was arrested, but when he was transported to a crime scene during a <b>judicial</b> <b>investigation,</b> he escaped and fled to Bohemia, where he was detained for vagrancy.

25|$|The {{definitive}} and unanimous results {{produced by}} the 2011 Chilean <b>judicial</b> <b>investigation</b> appear to have laid to rest decades of nagging suspicions that Allende might have been assassinated by the Chilean Armed Forces. But public acceptance of the suicide theory had already been growing {{for much of the}} previous decade. In a post-junta Chile where restrictions on free speech were steadily eroding, independent and seemingly reliable witnesses at last began to tell their stories to the news media and to human rights researchers. The cumulative weight of the facts reported by these witnesses provided factual support for many previously unconfirmed details relating to Allende's death.|$|E

25|$|It was {{reported}} in the Rome newspaper, La Repubblica, in January 2000 that Francesco Conconi, a professor at the University of Ferrara involved with administering erythropoietin (EPO) to riders on the Carrera team with which Roche had some of his best years, had provided riders including Roche with EPO. Roche denied the allegations. This was further reported in the Irish Times several days later, Roche again denying EPO. In March 2000 the Italian judge Franca Oliva published a report detailing the investigation into sports doctors including Conconi. This official <b>judicial</b> <b>investigation</b> unequivocally found that Roche was administered EPO in 1993, his last year in the peloton.|$|E
25|$|The Argentine Revenue Administration (AFIP) {{called for}} the {{printing}} house Ciccone Calcográfica to declare bankruptcy in July 2010, but two months later, after Ciccone received 2.3 million pesos (US$600,000) from the Old Fund, a shell corporation whose representative, Alejandro Vandenbroele, thereupon became president of Ciccone, the AFIP rescinded its request and, on orders from then Minister of Economy Amado Boudou, allowed Ciccone time to refinance its debts. After Laura Muñoz, Vandenbroele's ex-wife, publicly {{accused him of being}} a front for Boudou, the latter denied the charge, but in April 2012 a <b>judicial</b> <b>investigation</b> revealed that Vandenbroele had paid the rent for a flat belonging to Boudou. Members of Congress tried unsuccessfully to impeach Boudou. In September 2013, a Federal Court permitted Boudou to file for a dismissal of charges. Despite the scandal, the Central Bank of Argentina commissioned Ciccone in March 2012 to print banknotes.|$|E
25|$|By early February, {{a massive}} illegal {{financing}} network had been uncovered affecting the PPCV, {{with dozens of}} party officials and city councillors indicted or arrested. <b>Judicial</b> <b>investigation</b> also pointed to former long-time Mayor of Valencia and PP icon, Rita Barberá, as {{a participant in the}} scandal. The party found itself at risk of losing its municipal group in the city of Valencia—the third largest of Spain, which had seen 24 years of PP rule under Barberá's command—and rumours arising on a refoundation of the party in the region. The PP had been expelled from the local and regional Valencian governments in the elections held throughout 2015 after a two decade-uninterrupted rule. As corruption scandals also spread to Madrid on 11 February, with evidence suggesting that the public work contract kickbacks of 'Operation Punica' could also involve a possible illegal financing of the PP in the region, Esperanza Aguirre, regional party president of Madrid, resigned from her position on 14 February, in a move that was widely interpreted as a broadside against Rajoy, her long-standing party rival.|$|E
