50|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>peas</b> are an {{important}} rotation crop in the Palouse region, along with lentils and garbanzo beans. As a nitrogen-fixating plant, the legumes replenish the soil and enhance the area's wheat production. Farmers harvest the variety of peas planted on the Palouse after they are completely dry. The purpose of seed warehouses is to store the peas until the farmer is ready to sell them, either for a higher price or for supplemental operating funds. Local farms produce twenty-five percent of the nation's <b>dry</b> <b>peas</b> and lentil. During WW II, area farmers shipped 60 million pounds of <b>dry</b> <b>peas</b> to war-torn areas. <b>Dry</b> <b>peas</b> fulfill a variety of purposes for both human and animal consumption, including Campbell's split-pea soup packets and as a supplemental ingredient for animal feed.|$|R

Key breeding objectives in pea include improving biotic and abiotic stress resistance and enhancing yield components and seed quality. Taking advantage of the diversity present in the pea genepool, many mapping populations have been constructed in the last decades and efforts have been deployed to identify loci involved in the control of target traits and further introgress them into elite breeding materials. Pea now benefits from next-generation sequencing and high-throughput genotyping technologies that are paving the way for genome-wide association studies and genomic selection approaches.

40|$|Oilseed {{and pulse}} crops have been {{increasingly}} used to replace conventional summer fallow and diversify cropping systems in northern high latitude areas. The knowledge of water use (WU) and its distribution {{profile in the}} soil is essential for optimizing cropping systems aimed at improving water use efficiency (WUE). This study characterized water use and distribution profile for pulse and oilseed crops compared to spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in a semiarid environment. Three oilseeds [canola (Brassica napus L.), mustard (Brassica juncea L.) and flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) ], three pulses [chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), <b>dry</b> <b>pea</b> (Pisum sativum L.) and lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) ], and spring wheat were seeded in removable 100  cm deep x   15  cm diameter lysimeters placed in an Aridic Haploboroll soil, in southwest Saskatchewan in 2006 and 2007. Crops were studied under rainfed and irrigated conditions where lysimeters were removed and sampled for plant biomass and WU at various soil depths. Wheat yields were greater than pulse crop yields which were greater than oilseed yields, and WUE averaged 4. 08  kg ha- 1  mm- 1 for pulse crops, 3. 64  kg ha- 1  mm- 1 for oilseeds, and ranged between 5. 5 and 7. 0  kg ha- 1  mm- 1 for wheat. Wheat used water faster than pulse and oilseed crops with crop growth. Pulse crops extracted water mostly from the upper 60  cm soil depths, and left more water unused in the profile at maturity compared to oilseeds or wheat. Among the three pulses, lentil used {{the least amount of}} water and appeared to have a shallower rooting depth than chickpea and <b>dry</b> <b>pea.</b> Soil WU and distribution profile under canola and mustard were generally similar; both using more water than flax. Differences in WU and distribution profile were similar for crops grown under rainfall and irrigation conditions. A deep rooting crop grown after pulses may receive more benefits from water conservation in the soil profile than when grown after oilseed or wheat. Alternating pulse crops with oilseeds or wheat in a well-planned crop sequence may improve WUE for the entire cropping systems in semiarid environments.

The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify the effects of four short-season spring-planted crops used to replace summer fallow on the subsequent winter wheat crop. Wheat was seeded into four crop stubbles [spring triticale (xTriticosecale Wittmack), <b>dry</b> <b>pea</b> (Pisum sativum L.), foxtail millet (Setaria italica L. Beauv.), and proso millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) ] at sites near Akron, CO, and Sidney, NE, in the fall of 2004 and 2005. These summer fallow replacement crops were planted into silt loam soils at three different soil water levels at planting (low, medium, and high). Winter wheat water use was 3. 6 cm greater, and grain yield was 662 kg ha- 1 greater in the high water treatment compared with the low water treatment averaged across all sites and years. Winter wheat used an average of 4. 3 cm more water following early planted summer crops (triticale and <b>dry</b> <b>pea)</b> than after late planted summer crops (foxtail and proso millet), but this increased water use did not consistently translate into increased grain yield as a result of terminal drought at Sidney in 2006. The high water treatment always had a positive net return. The high cost of pea seed ($ 3. 30 kg- 1, USD) strongly reduced profitability.

The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the complete phytochemical profiles, antioxidant activity, cellular antioxidant activity, and their contribution to bioactivity in purple potato flour, <b>dry</b> <b>pea</b> flour, raw formulations, and extrusion cooked products prepared with the above ingredients. The free fraction of extracts contributed 68, 64, and 88 % to total phenolics, total antioxidant activity (ORAC value), and total flavonoids, respectively, in purple potato flour (PPF).

Minimal attention has been given to the efficient exploitation of crop diversity and the synergistic and/or antagonistic relationships of crops in crop sequences. Objectives of our research were to determine if previous crop sequences have long-term benefits and/or drawbacks on spring wheat seed yield, seed N concentration, and seed precipitation-use efficiency in the semiarid northern Great Plains, USA. Research was conducted 6 km southwest of Mandan, ND using a 10 × 10 crop matrix technique as a research tool to evaluate multiple crop sequence effects on spring wheat (triticum aestivum L.) production in 2004 and 2005. Spring wheat production risks can be mitigated when second year crop residue was <b>dry</b> <b>pea</b> (Pisium sativum L.) averaged over all first year crop residues. When compared to spring wheat as second year crop residue in the dry year of 2004, <b>dry</b> <b>pea</b> as the second year residue crop resulted in a 30 % spring wheat seed yield increase. Sustainable cropping systems need to use precipitation efficiently for crop production, especially during below average precipitation years like 2004.
