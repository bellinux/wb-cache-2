5|$|Outside of Texas, Hurricane Claudette caused little damage {{due to its}} low intensity. In total, damage {{estimates}} rose to $180million (2003 USD, $198million 2006USD), and {{the storm}} caused one direct and two indirect deaths. One of the indirect deaths occurred from a man <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> while surfing in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|After an {{incident}} in 1951, where a US Army inductee attempted suicide with multiple doses of warfarin in rodenticide but recovered fully after presenting to a hospital and being treated with vitamin K (by then known as a specific antidote), studies began {{in the use of}} warfarin as a therapeutic anticoagulant. It was found to be generally superior to dicoumarol, and in 1954 was approved for medical use in humans. An early recipient of warfarin was US president Dwight Eisenhower, who was prescribed the drug after <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> in 1955.|$|E
25|$|A strenuous {{trip to the}} United States in 1964 led to Meitner <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack,</b> {{from which}} she spent several months recovering. Her {{physical}} and mental condition weakened by atherosclerosis, {{she was unable to}} travel to the US to receive the Enrico Fermi prize and relatives had to present it to her. After breaking her hip in a fall and suffering several small strokes in 1967, Meitner made a partial recovery, but eventually was weakened to the point where she moved into a Cambridge nursing home.|$|E
5|$|Studies <b>have</b> {{not found}} <b>an</b> overall benefit {{in the general}} {{population}} of healthy people, although it is possible that there are small benefits for those at especially high risk, despite never <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> or stroke in the past. One study found that among those who <b>have</b> never <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> or stroke, taking aspirin daily for 1 year prevents 1 in 1,667 from <b>having</b> <b>a</b> non-fatal <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> or stroke, but caused 1 in 3,333 to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> non-fatal bleeding event. However, the study population were at relatively higher risk than those who <b>had</b> never <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> or stroke.|$|R

25|$|Shirley {{supports}} Phil through recovery. They steal a {{large amount}} of money from Phil's cousin, Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), to buy a house together. Roxy's mother, Glenda Mitchell (Glynis Barber) finds out, and propositions Phil so they begin an affair. When Phil discovers Glenda has also had sex with his enemy, Ian, he threatens to tell Ian's wife, Jane Beale (Laurie Brett), unless he pays him £5000. Phil's bullying of Ian almost costs him his life: when Ian finds Phil <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack,</b> he threatens to let him die but helps Phil for Ben's sake. Phil re-evaluates his life following his near-death experience and proposes to Shirley. Shirley initially accepts, but when she discovers Phil's infidelity with Glenda, she forgives him but refuses to marry.|$|E

The idea for the episode came from James L.

500|$|Morris had {{considered}} filming the Australian scenes in South Africa {{due to the}} comparatively high costs in Australia, which despite a higher budget caused the sequel to have fewer resources than its predecessor. While all locations for the first film had been within 10 minutes of the hotel, locations in the second were separated by a three-hour flight and nine-hour car journey. During filming in the Outback, the Australian crew provided two doctors and 40 litres of IV fluid, although the only point in which a doctor was called was when Buckley {{thought that he was}} <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack,</b> which was in reality indigestion from chips and lager. Beesley considered it [...] "the maniac's choice of a film to be your first film". The water park scenes were filmed at Wet'n'Wild Gold Coast, which Thomas described as [...] "some quite challenging scenes".|$|E
500|$|At {{the bowling}} alley, Mort Goldman bowls a perfect game and becomes an {{overnight}} celebrity. Lois arrives to pick Peter {{up from the}} bowling alley, but discovers Quagmire spying on her from {{the ceiling of the}} ladies' toilet. Quagmire is beaten up then arrested, but released shortly after by Joe. On his return, Lois, Bonnie and Loretta reveal that they're petitioning the city of Quahog to have Quagmire removed from their neighborhood. As Peter and the other guys are defending Quagmire, Ernie the Giant Chicken attacks Peter and starts a fight that causes huge casualties inside and outside of Quahog. After the fight, Peter returns to the neighborhood to return to the conversation and tells the women that, [...] "Quagmire's a good guy, he's just a little mixed up, that's all!" [...] Eventually, the women agree to let Quagmire stay in the neighborhood so long as he manages to control his perverse behavior. Quagmire's taught self-control through operant conditioning by Peter and his friends, and is eventually allowed out in public. Soon, however, he is distracted by women playing in a fountain in the shopping mall and panics, running into a CCTV camera operation room monitoring women's changing rooms. Discovering that a lady in a fitting room is <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack,</b> he appears to rush to her aid, performing CPR and saving her life. Quagmire is congratulated for his heroism, but his intention had been to molest the woman while she was unconscious (which he reveals by asking [...] "What the hell is CPR?").|$|E

Following Ritter's death, ABC announced that 8 Simple Rules would continue after a hiatus, and would incorporate the death of his character. The three new episodes that Ritter completed were aired with Sagal introducing them.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} health {{problems}} associated with Newfoundlands. Newfoundlands are prone to hip dysplasia (a malformed ball and socket in the hip joint). They also get Elbow dysplasia, and cystinuria (a hereditary defect that forms calculi stones in the bladder). [...] Another genetic problem is subvalvular aortic stenosis (SAS). This is a common heart defect in Newfoundlands involving defective heart valves. SAS can cause sudden death at an early age. It is similar to <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack.</b> [...] It is common that [...] "Newfs" [...] live to be 8 to 10 years of age; 10 years is a commonly cited life expectancy.

During the time before the fight, Shamrock {{was going through a}} divorce and {{had to take care of}} his young kids during the day, which severely cut into his training time for the fight. Despite this, Shamrock dominated Fujita throughout the entire fight, stopping takedowns from the Japanese wrestling champion and landing hard strikes, but eventually had his corner throw in the towel because he felt like he was <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack.</b> He was evaluated after the fight and it was determined that he was suffering from heart palpitations.|$|E

2500|$|On April 27, 1996, Colby set {{out from}} his weekend home in Rock Point, Maryland on a solo canoe trip. His canoe was found the {{following}} day on a sandbar in the Wicomico River, {{a tributary of the}} Potomac, approximately a quarter mile from his home. On May 6, Colby's body was found in a marshy riverbank lying facedown not far from where his canoe was found. After an autopsy, Maryland's Chief Medical Examiner John E. Smialek ruled his death to be accidental. Smialek's report noted that Colby was predisposed to <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> or stroke due to [...] "severe calcified atherosclerosis" [...] and that Colby likely [...] "suffered a complication of this atherosclerosis which precipitated him into the cold water in a debilitated state and he succumbed to the effects of hypothermia and drowned".|$|E
2500|$|Lois's {{personality}} {{has evolved}} throughout the episodes. She is commonly {{the voice of}} reason to Peter's shenanigans, but in some episodes she can act darker than normal and sometimes shows a taste for sadomasochism. In the episode [...] "The Son Also Draws", Lois showed a gambling addiction when the family went to an Indian casino and lost the family car. In the episode [...] "Model Misbehavior", Lois becomes a bulimic model. However, in [...] "Sibling Rivalry", just the opposite happens where Lois gains a ton of weight after Peter has a vasectomy and loses his sex drive. As a result, Peter makes fun of her causing her to get even fatter out of spite. He doesn't stop until he discovers just how amazing [...] "fat-sex" [...] is and force feeds her to make her even fatter which in turn will please him. By {{the end of the}} episode she is returned to her normal weight by the family doctor after <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack.</b> [...] "Stuck Together, Torn Apart" [...] shows Peter and Lois splitting up because of Peter's jealousy, only to discover that Lois has the same character flaw of jealousy and the two decide to live with their mutually jealous nature. She has also hinted at or been shown using drugs. After the first two seasons, Lois is shown to have more of an egotistical, neglectful, and cold-hearted personality, usually towards Brian or Meg (and later Stewie).|$|E
2500|$|To {{support the}} album's release {{the group had}} been {{scheduled}} to play at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival. During this period Vliet suffered severe anxiety attacks that made him convinced that he was <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack,</b> possibly exacerbated by his heavy LSD use and the fact that his father had died of heart failure a few years earlier. At a vital [...] "warm-up" [...] performance at the Mt. Tamalpais Festival (June 10/11) shortly before the scheduled Monterey Festival (June 16/18), the band began to play [...] "Electricity" [...] and Van Vliet froze, straightened his tie, then walked off the [...] stage and landed on manager Bob Krasnow. He later claimed he had seen a girl in the audience turn into a fish, with bubbles coming from her mouth. This aborted any opportunity of breakthrough success at Monterey, as Cooder immediately decided he could no longer work with Van Vliet, effectively quitting both the event and the band on the spot. With such complex guitar parts there was no means for the band to find a competent replacement in time for Monterey. Cooder's spot was eventually filled for a short spell by Gerry McGee, who had played with the Monkees. According to French the band did two gigs with McGee, one of which was at The Peppermint Twist near Long Beach. The other was at Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, August 7, 1967, as opening act for the Yardbirds. McGee was in the group long enough to have an outfit made by a Santa Monica boutique that also created the gear worn by the band on the Strictly Personal cover stamps.|$|E
