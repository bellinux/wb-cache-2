5000|$|In {{water tube}} boilers, {{the way the}} water is {{recirculated}} inside the boiler before becoming steam {{can be described as}} either natural circulation or <b>forced</b> <b>circulation.</b> In a water tube boiler, the water is recirculated inside until the vapor pressure of the water overcomes the vapor pressure inside the stream drum and becomes saturated steam. The <b>forced</b> <b>circulation</b> boiler begins the same as a natural circulation boiler, at the feed water pump. Water is introduced into the steam drum and is circulated around the boiler, leaving only as steam. What makes the <b>forced</b> <b>circulation</b> boiler different is its use of a secondary pump that circulates water through the boiler. The secondary pump takes the feed water going to the boiler and raises the pressure of the water going in. In a natural circulation boilers, the circulation of water is dependent on the differential pressures caused by the change of density in the water as it is heated. That is to say that as the water is heated and starts turning to steam, the density decreases sending the hottest water and steam {{to the top of the}} furnace tubes. In contrast to the natural circulation boiler, the <b>forced</b> <b>circulation</b> boiler uses a water circulation pump to force that flow instead of waiting for the differential to form. Because of this, the generation tubes of a <b>forced</b> <b>circulation</b> boiler are able to be oriented in whatever way is required by space constraints. Water is taken from the drum and forced through the steel tubes. In this way it is able to produce steam much faster than that of a natural circulation boiler ...|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with computation of a lift force generated by flow past a cylinder. It provides definition of fundamental terms regarding flow and recounts the laws of balance. It offers an alternative formulation of balance of momentum for the particular case of steady flow - Crocco's theorem - which formulates balance of momentum using total enthalpy and links the change of entropy with vorticity. Next, Biot-Savart's law for vortex filament in a fluid is derived. Potential flow and complex potential are then used to describe flow past a cylinder; lift force is calculated {{as a product of}} velocity at infinity, the fluid's density and circulation. Using Crocco's theorem, the thesis considers release of the heat of condensation, the change in entropy and the following emergence of vorticity resulting in circulation and, consequently, lift force. The thesis can be used to provide basis for an experiment.

40|$|MYRRHA (Multi-purpose hYbrid Research Reactor for High-tech Applications) is a {{multi-purpose}} flexible fast spectrum irradiation facility, for Research and Development (R&D) applications, cooled by liquid lead-bismuth (Pb-Bi). E-SCAPE (European SCAled Pool Experiment) is a thermal-hydraulic scaled {{model of}} the MYRRHA reactor. The aim of this facility is to simulate the operating conditions during <b>forced</b> and natural <b>circulation</b> in a reactor using LBE as a coolant, in order to analyse the thermal-hydraulic phenomena occurring in the reactor pool and to validate the codes used in the preliminary analysis of the system, comparing the results obtained with the simulations and the experimental results. The present work, conducted {{in collaboration with the}} SCK•CEN staff, focuses on the thermal-hydraulic analysis of E-SCAPE in steady state conditions during natural and <b>forced</b> <b>circulations.</b> Transient conditions were also simulated in order to analyse the reactor behaviour during operational accidents. A RELAP 5 model of E-SCAPE has been implemented, reproducing the current configuration. The results obtained from the RELAP 5 simulations provide important information about E-SCAPE's behaviour, such as the LBE mass flow rate, temperature, pressure and the level of the free surfaces, in steady-state conditions (<b>forced</b> and natural <b>circulation)</b> and during accidental transients,. Due to the inadequacy of RELAP 5 to investigate the three dimensional flow phenomena, a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analysis of the lower plenum has been performed using the code ANSYS CFX 14. 0, in order to acquire more information about the flow behaviour inside the E-SCAPE lower plenum. Several analysis in steady-state and transient conditions have been implemented, in order to simulate the flow behaviour inside the lower plenum in different conditions. The results obtained with both codes have been used to improve the models and to reduce the inaccuracies of previous simulations...|$|R
