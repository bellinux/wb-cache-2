50|$|This {{instability}} {{is illustrated}} in the right panel of the figure on the right. As the cantilever approaches, {{the slope of the}} <b>force</b> <b>curve</b> increases.

50|$|Generally, {{materials}} display {{either a}} flat R curve or a rising R curve. For a flat R curve, material resistance is constant {{with respect to}} crack extension. When the resistance curve is flat, it exhibits a critical value of energy release rate Gc. A material with a rising R curve, however, cannot be uniquely characterized with a single toughness value. A flawed structure fails when the driving <b>force</b> <b>curve</b> is tangent to the R curve, but this point of tangency depends on {{the shape of the}} driving <b>force</b> <b>curve,</b> which depends on the configuration of the structure. Materials with rising R curves are generally characterized by the value of G at the beginning of crack growth, but the precise moment of initiation is unclear. The R curve for an ideally brittle material is flat because the surface energy is a fixed property. Nonlinear behavior, like ductile fracture, can result in a rising R curve as the plastic zone at crack tip increases in size with extension. Falling R curves occur when a metal fails by cleavage. Cleavage propagation is unstable and very high strain rates are found near the crack tip. This suppresses plastic deformation.|$|E

Effects from particle geometries are introduced in the dimensional model through dimensional analysis. A characteristic length describing the vertical extent of the particles is defined. An example calculation of the characteristic length for a spherical particle of known radius is presented.

40|$|Interaction forces {{between a}} {{hydrophilic}} silica particle and an air bubble were measured by {{atomic force microscopy}} using simplified model systems with deionized water and dilute KCl solutions. Contributions from the hydrodynamic force were minimized by using a low piezo speed. Particle–bubble separation distance and the bubble spring constant were calculated from linear regression of the piezo extension versus cantilever deflection. The bubble surface potential was then estimated from fitting the AFM-measured forces to the Hogg–Healy–Fuerstenau (HHF) model, using the surface element integration (SEI) method. Surface potentials obtained for the bubble at a low applied force were comparable with the literature data, suggesting that the simplified model used here can give a reasonable estimation of the bubble surface potential under moderate applied forces. Interaction forces between a silica particle and an air bubble were also measured at different locations on the air bubble surface. The <b>force</b> <b>curves</b> obtained {{at the edges of}} the bubble fitted very well to the theoretical <b>force</b> <b>curves</b> regardless of the applied <b>force,</b> while <b>curves</b> obtained at the center and halfway to the center, were more difficult to fit, in particular at higher applied forces (> 13 nN), suggesting that <b>force</b> <b>curves</b> obtained {{at the edges of the}} air bubble might be less prone to deformation effects...|$|R
50|$|Molecules adsorbed on {{a surface}} are {{picked up by}} a {{microscopic}} tip (nanometres wide) that is located on the end of an elastic cantilever. In a more sophisticated version of this experiment (Chemical Force Microscopy) the tips are covalently functionalized with the molecules of interest. A piezoelectric controller then pulls up the cantilever. If some force is acting on the elastic cantilever (for example because some molecule is being stretched between the surface and the tip), this will deflect upward (repulsive force) or downward (attractive force). According to Hooke's law, this deflection will be proportional to the force acting on the cantilever. Deflection is measured by the position of a laser beam reflected by the cantilever. This kind of set-up can measure forces as low as 10 pN (10−11 N), and cannot achieve much better resolution only because of thermal noise. The so-called <b>force</b> <b>curve</b> is the graph of force (or more precisely, of cantilever deflection) versus the piezoelectric position on the Z axis. An ideal Hookean spring, for example, would display a straight diagonal force curve.Typically, the force curves observed in the force spectroscopy experiments consist of a contact (diagonal) region where the probe contacts the sample surface, and a non-contact region where the probe is off the sample surface. When the restoring force of the cantilever exceeds tip-sample adhesion force the probe jumps out of contact, and the magnitude of this jump is often used as a measure of adhesion force or rupture force. In general the rupture of a tip-surface bond is a stochastic process; therefore reliable quantification of the adhesion force requires taking multiple individual force curves. The histogram of the adhesion forces obtained in these multiple measurements provides the main data output for force spectroscopy measurement.|$|E
