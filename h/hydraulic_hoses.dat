25|$|The spring {{release device}} {{was used in}} the past almost universally on {{trailing}} type plows with one to three or four bottoms. It is not practical on larger plows. When an obstruction is encountered the spring release mechanism in the hitch permits the plow to uncouple from the tractor. When a hydraulic lift is used on the plow, the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hoses</b> will also usually uncouple automatically when the plow uncouples.|$|E
25|$|Most bicycle {{brake systems}} consist of three main {{components:}} {{a mechanism for}} the rider to apply the brakes, such as brake levers or pedals; a mechanism for transmitting that signal, such as Bowden cables, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hoses,</b> rods, or the bicycle chain; and the brake mechanism itself, a caliper or drum, to press two or more surfaces together in order to convert, via friction, kinetic energy of the bike and rider into thermal energy to be dissipated.|$|E

25|$|A CAF {{maintenance}} team {{arrived at}} China Lake on 31 March 1971 and in only nine weeks, {{with the help}} of more CAF volunteers, they restored all systems and replaced fuel, oil and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hoses.</b> The restoration process involved cannibalizing parts from other B-29s at China Lake, installing instruments, having new window bubbles made and restoring controls to working order. After the CAF technicians ran the engines, tested propellers and landing gear, N4249 was made ready to fly again by 3 August 1971. They had a permit to make a single ferry flight out of China Lake although once it landed, the B-29 would be grounded.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, 1981 and 1982, {{there were}} further repairs {{to the ceiling}} of the presbytery and {{staircase}} of the choir; substitution of the zinc flap edges and tile flooring. In 1980, the LNEC realized a study of the stone, for signs of degradation based on physical, chemical and petrographic assessments. These investigations were followed, in 1983, by conservation and cleaning of the facade, using <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hoses</b> to remove the dirt, accompanied by hard-bristle brushes and soft sponges. In 1984, the DGEMN, demolished and reconstructed the firewall with plaster and whitewash; chipping away the plaster facade and replacing it with new plaster of mortar, whitewashing the completed surface; repair and replacement of the pavement of the choir; replacement of the ceiling plaster, paint and window grills; varnishing the doors; substitution of glass; cracks and joints were grouted in the facade, with new stone replacing older rock, which was removed and replaced.|$|E

50|$|Major {{secondary}} industries {{based in}} Wodonga include a logistics distributions hub (LOGIC), a large cattle market, a pet food factory (Mars Corporation), a can factory (Visy), {{a cardboard box}} factory (Visy Board), a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hose</b> manufacturer, an abattoir, and a foundry (Bradken Limited) {{as well as a}} variety of other, smaller enterprises. It also serves as a central point for the delivery of government services to the surrounding region.|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic systems rely on high {{pressures}} (usually over 7000 kPa) to work properly. If {{a hydraulic}} system loses fluid pressure, (burst <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hose)</b> {{it will become}} inoperative and components such as actuators may collapse. This is an undesirable condition in life-critical systems such as aircraft or heavy machinery, such as forklifts. Hydraulic fuses help guard against catastrophic failure of a hydraulic system (for instance, by line breakage or component failure) by automatically isolating the defective branch.|$|R
50|$|Pederson-Sells Equipment, Inc. was a 44-year-old wholesale/retail {{distributor}} of agricultural and hydraulic components serving the agricultural, industrial and mobile markets. Their customers included agriculture implement dealers, fertilizer dealers, agriculture equipment manufacturers, manufacturers of construction and industrial equipment, repair and hydraulic shops, and {{local and state}} departments of transportation in the upper Midwest area. Repair items included hydraulic pumps, valves, motors, and cylinders; <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hose</b> assembly machines numbering in excess of 700 {{had been placed in}} dealer shops.|$|R

50|$|During the 1930s steam shovels {{lost out}} to the simpler, cheaper {{diesel-powered}} excavating shovels that were the forerunners of those still in use today. Open-pit mines were electrified at this time. Only after the Second World War, {{with the advent of}} robust high-pressure <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hoses,</b> did the more versatile hydraulic excavators take pre-eminence over the cable-hoisting winch shovels.|$|E
50|$|Advances in {{technology}} have allowed for portable hydraulic breakers. The jackhammer {{is connected with}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hoses</b> to a portable hydraulic powerpack: either a petrol or diesel engine driving a hydraulic pump; or a mini-excavator or skid-steer via a power take-off driveshaft to the machine's hydraulic system. Hydraulic power sources are more efficient than air compressors, making the kit smaller, cheaper or more powerful than a comparable pneumatic version.|$|E
40|$|Usually, {{automobile}} high-pressure <b>hose,</b> such as <b>hydraulic</b> brake <b>hose,</b> {{has been}} developed through investigating several actual prototype hoses experimentally. Recently, high durability for brake hose has been required because periodic renewing the brake hoses has not been requested anymore. In this study, FEM stress analysis {{has been applied to}} the crimped portion of <b>hydraulic</b> brake <b>hose</b> in order to promote the development of the automobile hoses more efficiently. The sealing performance is discussed focusing on the normal stress between the nipple and inner rubber with varying several important geometrical dimensions of crimped portion...|$|R

50|$|The two steam {{locomotives}} {{each had}} a pair of 1,000 hp Cummins diesel engines in their tenders that supplied their power and movement, and where <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hoses</b> connected the engines to their tenders. Both trains were operated by a computer inside both of their cabs, but a real locomotive engineer had to be inside them to control the brakes, and he would override the computers in case of an emergency. Special effects were used to produce the smoke and steam that came from the engines.|$|E
50|$|Electric {{systems have}} an {{advantage}} in fuel efficiency {{because there is no}} belt-driven hydraulic pump constantly running, whether assistance is required or not, and this is a major reason for their introduction. Another major advantage is the elimination of a belt-driven engine accessory, and several high-pressure <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hoses</b> between the hydraulic pump, mounted on the engine, and the steering gear, mounted on the chassis. This greatly simplifies manufacturing and maintenance. By incorporating electronic stability control electric power steering systems can instantly vary torque assist levels to aid the driver in corrective maneuvers.|$|E

50|$|Installing linear {{position}} sensors into {{hydraulic cylinders}} {{has been a}} sore subject for cylinder manufacturers for a long time. Extensive fabrication headaches, including gun drilling, the need to stock all different sensor lengths, and handling issues have contributed to industry frustration. CPI has been developing {{a new generation of}} sensors which eliminates the need for gun drilling. CPI SL Series Sensors install into standard hydraulic cylinders with minimal modifications and are suitable for field retrofit where rod-type sensors have failed. The cable connector installs into the piston or rod via a 7/16”-20 threaded connector, and the sensor is coupled to the cylinder via a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hose</b> through a #8 SAE port.|$|R
