25|$|Current {{reversal}} {{occurs when}} the current changes direction. Voltage reversal is the change of polarity in a circuit. Reversal is generally described {{as the percentage of}} the maximum rated voltage that reverses polarity. In <b>DC</b> <b>circuits,</b> this is usually less than 100%, often in the range of 0 to 90%, whereas AC circuits experience 100% reversal.|$|E
25|$|Electrically, RO is a {{resistance}} {{controlled by the}} current flowing through the light source. In the dark state, the resistance typically exceeds a few MOhm; when illuminated, it decreases as the inverse of the light intensity. In contrast to the photodiode and phototransistor, the photoresistor can operate in both the AC and <b>DC</b> <b>circuits</b> and have a voltage of several hundred volts across it. The harmonic distortions of the output current by the RO are typically within 0.1% at voltages below 0.5 V.|$|E

25|$|For maximum life, {{capacitors}} usually {{need to be}} able {{to handle}} the maximum amount of reversal that a system may experience. An AC circuit experiences 100% voltage reversal, while underdamped <b>DC</b> <b>circuits</b> experience less than 100%. Reversal creates excess electric fields in the dielectric, causes excess heating of both the dielectric and the conductors, and can dramatically shorten the life expectancy of the capacitor. Reversal ratings often affect the design considerations for the capacitor, from the choice of dielectric materials and voltage ratings to the types of internal connections used.|$|E
25|$|In <b>DC</b> <b>circuits</b> and pulsed circuits, {{current and}} voltage {{reversal}} {{are affected by}} the damping of the system. Voltage reversal is encountered in RLC circuits that are underdamped. The current and voltage reverse direction, forming a harmonic oscillator between the inductance and capacitance. The current and voltage tends to oscillate and may reverse direction several times, with each peak being lower than the previous, until the system reaches an equilibrium. This {{is often referred to as}} ringing. In comparison, critically damped or overdamped systems usually do not experience a voltage reversal. Reversal is also encountered in AC circuits, where the peak current is equal in each direction.|$|E
25|$|The {{scope of}} {{application}} for DC capacitors is similarly diverse. Smoothing capacitors are used to reduce the AC component of fluctuating DC voltage (such as in power supplies for radio and television transmitters), and for high voltage testing equipment, DC controllers, measurement and control technology and cascaded circuits for generation of high DC voltage. Supporting capacitors, DC-filter or buffer circuit capacitors are used for energy storage in intermediate <b>DC</b> <b>circuits,</b> such as in frequency converters for poly-phase drives, and transistor and thyristor power converters. They {{must be able to}} absorb and release very high currents within short periods, the peak values of currents being substantially greater than the RMS values.|$|E
