On the first play of the drive, however, Maurice DeShazo scrambled for a ten-yard gain but fumbled the ball. The loose ball was recovered by a Tennessee defender, and the Volunteers took over on offense from the Tech 32-yard line. Branndon Stewart came out onto the field in place of Manning, and completed an eight-yard pass to James Stewart to begin the drive. James Stewart then ran to the 20-yard line for a first down. On the next play, Tennessee executed a trick play in which James Stewart received the ball via a <b>hand-off,</b> imitating a running play, but threw the ball instead. The pass was caught by James Kendrick for a touchdown, and after the extra point, Tennessee had a 357 lead with 2:08 remaining in the first half.|$|E

500|$|In 2008, Nevada {{typically}} ran {{an offensive}} scheme {{referred to as}} the [...] "pistol offense", a system that was pioneered by head coach Chris Ault.

It aims to create man-to-man match-ups with the receivers and compensate for an undersized offensive line. With the running back obscured from view by the quarterback, it can also create confusion for the opposing linebackers and allow more effective deception, which is critical to play-action fakes.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the Shadow Cluster concept, a novel idea {{that can be}} used to improve the resource allocation and the call admission procedures in wireless networks. Shadow clusters can be used to allocate resources that need to be reserved for call <b>hand-offs,</b> and to determine if a new call should be admitted to a wireless network based on the call's requirements and local traffic conditions. The shadow cluster concept is targeted for ATM-based wireless networks with a micro/nano-cellular architecture, where service will be provided to users with very diverse requirements. In these networks, and as a consequence of the small cell sizes, mobile users will typically experience a high number of cell <b>hand-offs</b> during their connections' lifetime. With shadow clusters, the quality of service of mobile calls can be improved by reducing the number of dropped calls during <b>hand-offs,</b> and by disallowing the establishment of new calls that are highly likely to later result in a dropped call.

40|$|Heterogeneous {{wireless}} {{networks are}} capable of providing customers with better services while service providers can offer more applications to more customers with lower costs. To provide services, some applications rely on existing servers in the network. In a vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) some mobile nodes may function as servers. Due to high mobility of nodes and short lifetime of links, server-to-client and server-to-server communications become challenging. In this paper we propose to enhance the performance of server selection by taking link reliability into consideration in the server selection mechanism, thereby avoiding extra client-to-server <b>hand-offs</b> and reducing the need of server-to-server synchronization. As a case study we focus on location management service in a heterogeneous VANET. We provide a routing algorithm for transactions between location servers and mobile nodes. We assume that location servers are vehicles equipped {{with at least one}} long- range and one short-range radio interfaces, whereas regular nodes (clients) are only equipped with a short-range radio interface. The primary goal of our design is to minimize <b>hand-offs</b> between location servers while limiting the delays of location updates. Taking advantage of vehicle mobility patterns, we propose a mobility-aware server selection scheme and show that it can reduce the number of <b>hand-offs</b> and yet avoid large delays during location updates. We present simulation results to show that proposed scheme significantly lowers the costs of signaling and rate of server <b>hand-offs</b> by increasing the connection lifetimes between clients and servers...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} the Fast Hinted Cell Switching {{movement}} detection method for Mobile IP is introduced. This method {{assumes that the}} Link-Layer is capable of delivering information to Mobile IP regarding {{the identity of the}} local mobility agent. This tends to negate the need for Mobile IP movement detection as well as agent discovery and leads to accelerated Mobile IP <b>hand-offs.</b> Moreover, the existence of Link-Layer information renders the presence of periodic mobility agent broadcast advertisements as unnecessary which enables a more efficient utilisation of the network capacity. The performance of the proposed solution is experimentally compared against that of Eager Cell Switching that is considered the fastest of traditional Mobile IP movement detection methods. The scenarios investigated involve straight line movement patterns and Mobile IP <b>hand-offs</b> between Foreign Agents that provide wireless network connectivity through IEEE 802. 11 b Wireless LAN standard, compliant hardware. The IEEE 802. 11 SSID field was utilised to contain information important to Mobile IP such as the identity of the local mobility agent.
