5|$|Like most of {{the species}} of the order Phallales, Clathrus ruber is saprobic—a <b>decomposer</b> of wood and plant organic matter—and is {{commonly}} found fruiting in mulch beds. The fungus grows alone or clustered together near woody debris, in lawns, gardens, and cultivated soil.|$|E
5|$|As a {{saprobic}} mushroom, or <b>decomposer</b> {{of organic}} material, Ravenel's stinkhorn {{can be found}} in almost any habitat that includes decaying wood. They are most often found growing in groups, though occasionally singly, on wood chips, rotten tree stumps or sawdust. They are common in urban flowerbeds, parks and lawns, as well as in meadows, cultivated areas and woods. The foul odor of the gleba attracts insects that walk and feed on the spore-bearing surface, and later disseminate the sticky spores to other locales.|$|E
5|$|Mycena galopus is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and plays}} an important role in forest ecosystems as a <b>decomposer</b> of leaf litter. It has been estimated in the UK to account for a large portion of the decomposition of the autumn leaf litter in British woodlands. It is able to break down the lignin and cellulose components of leaf litter. Grown in axenic culture in the laboratory, the fungus mycelium has been shown to degrade (in addition to lignin and cellulose) hemicelluloses, protein, soluble carbohydrates, and purified xylan and pectin using enzymes such as polyphenol oxidases, cellulases, and catalase. It is particularly adept at breaking down lignin, which is the second most abundant renewable organic compound in the biosphere, after cellulose. Research also suggests that the fungus weathers soil minerals, making them more available to mycorrhizal plants. Phosphorus, an important macronutrient influencing plant growth, typically occurs in primary minerals like apatite, or other organic complexes, and its low solubility often results in low phosphorus availability in soil. The biological activity of M.galopus mycelium can increase the availability of phosphorus and other nutrients, both as a result of soil acidification due to cation uptake and via the release of weathering agents such low molecular mass organic acids. Studies have shown that the fungus is sensitive to low concentrations of sulphite (SO32−), a byproduct of sulphur dioxide pollution, suggesting that this pollution can be toxic to the growth of the fungus (and the subsequent decomposition of leaf litter) at environmentally relevant concentrations.|$|E

25|$|The use of predatory mites (for example, Phytoseiidae) in {{pest control}} and herbivorous mites that infest weeds are also of importance. An unquantified, but major {{positive}} {{contribution of the}} Acari is their normal functioning in ecosystems, especially their roles in the <b>decomposer</b> subsystem. In this context, the association of many species with carcasses and decaying organic matter qualify them as potential medico-legal indicators in forensic entomology.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of the equilibrium in the carbamate formation/decomposition depends on {{the product of the}} partial pressures of the reactants. In the total recycle processes, carbamate decomposition is promoted by reducing the overall pressure, which reduces the partial pressure of both ammonia and carbon dioxide. It is possible, however, to achieve a similar effect without lowering the overall pressure—by suppressing the partial pressure of just one of the reactants. Instead of feeding carbon dioxide gas directly to the reactor with the ammonia, as in the total recycle process, the stripping process first routes the carbon dioxide through a stripper (a carbamate <b>decomposer</b> that operates under full system pressure and configured to provide maximum gas-liquid contact). This flushes out free ammonia, reducing its partial pressure over the liquid surface and carrying it directly to a carbamate condenser (also under full system pressure). From there, reconstituted ammonium carbamate liquor passes directly to the reactor. That eliminates the medium-pressure stage of the total recycle process altogether.|$|E
25|$|Acarines live in {{practically}} every habitat, and include aquatic (freshwater and sea water) and terrestrial species. They outnumber other arthropods {{in the soil}} organic matter and detritus. Many are parasitic, and they affect both vertebrates and invertebrates. Most parasitic forms are external parasites, while the free living forms are generally predaceous and may even be used to control undesirable arthropods. Others are detritivores that help to break down forest litter and dead organic matter such as skin cells. Others still are plant feeders and may damage crops. Damage to crops {{is perhaps the most}} costly economic effect of mites, especially by the spider mites and their relatives (Tetranychoidea), earth mites (Penthaleidae), thread-footed mites (Tarsonemidae) and the gall and rust mites (Eriophyoidea). Some parasitic forms affect humans and other mammals, causing damage by their feeding, and can even be vectors of diseases such as scrub typhus and rickettsial pox. A well-known effect of mites on humans is their role as an allergen and the stimulation of asthma in people affected by the respiratory disease. The use of predatory mites (e.g. Phytoseiidae) in pest control and herbivorous mites that attack weeds is also important. An unquantified, but major positive contribution of the Acari is their normal functioning in ecosystems, especially their roles in the <b>decomposer</b> subsystem.|$|E

25|$|If the {{ancestors}} of the other flying insects evolved the same habit of clasping the female and dragging her over their spermathophore, but posterior instead of anterior like the Odonata does, their genitals would come very close to each other. And from there on, {{it would be a}} very short step to modify the vestigial appendages near the male genital opening to transfer the sperm directly into the female. The same appendages the male Odonata use to transfer their sperm to their secondary sexual organs at the front of their abdomen. All insects with an aquatic nymphal or larval stage seem to have adapted to water secondarily from terrestrial ancestors. Of the most primitive insects with no wings at all, Archaeognatha and Thysanura, all members live their entire life cycle in terrestrial environments. As mentioned previously, Archaeognatha were the first to split off from the branch that led to the winged insects (Pterygota), and then the Thysanura branched off. This indicates that these three groups (Archaeognatha, Thysanura and Pterygota) have a common terrestrial ancestor, which probably resembled a primitive model of Apterygota, was an opportunistic generalist and laid spermatophores on the ground instead of copulating, like Thysanura still do today. If it had feeding habits similar to the majority of apterygotes of today, it lived mostly as a <b>decomposer.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{real world}} ecosystems, {{there is more}} than one food chain for most organisms, since most organisms eat more than one kind of food or are eaten by more than one type of predator. A diagram that sets out the {{intricate}} network of intersecting and overlapping food chains for an ecosystem is called its food web. <b>Decomposers</b> are often left off food webs, but if included, they mark the end of a food chain. Thus food chains start with primary producers and end with decay and <b>decomposers.</b> Since <b>decomposers</b> recycle nutrients, leaving them so they can be reused by primary producers, they are sometimes regarded as occupying their own trophic level.|$|R

500|$|Fruitbodies of Stropharia caerulea form mycelial cords–rootlike {{structures}} {{consisting of}} a dense mass of hyphae–which create extensive underground networks that move nutrients and allow the fungus to [...] "forage" [...] for resources. These cords are often associated with stems and rhizomes of the common nettle (Urtica dioica). These mycelial systems' development and the species's interactions with other cord-forming wood <b>decomposer</b> basidiomycetes have been investigated. The mycelia of Stropharia caerulea form a fractal structure characterized by a dense, relatively slowly extending front, a formation associated with finding relatively homogeneously distributed nutrients–equivalent to short-range foraging. An increase in the supply of soil nitrogen or phosphorus increases the fractal branching of the mycelia, allowing increased uptake of nutrients.|$|E
2500|$|Arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} fungi {{have been}} shown to increase soil carbon decomposition in nutrient rich patches. Since arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are thought to lack the ability to produce the enzymes to catalyze this decomposition it is generally thought that they stimulate free-living <b>decomposer</b> communities to increase activity by exuding labile energy substrates, a process termed priming. Recent lab experiments have shown that the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi increases losses of soil carbon compared to soils where arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are excluded, and that the difference is greater under elevated CO2 when the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi is greater.|$|E

40|$|The {{productivity}} {{and diversity of}} plant communities are affected by soil organisms such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), root herbivores and <b>decomposers.</b> However, it is unknown how interactions between such functionally dissimilar soil organisms affect plant communities and whether the combined effects are additive or interactive. In a greenhouse experiment we investigated the individual and combined effects of AMF (five Glomus species), root herbivores (wireworms and nematodes) and <b>decomposers</b> (collembolans and enchytraeids) on the {{productivity and}} nutrient content of a model grassland plant {{community as well as}} on soil microbial biomass and community structure. The effects of the soil organisms on productivity (total plant biomass), total root biomass, grass and forb biomass, and nutrient uptake of the plant community were additive. AMF decreased, <b>decomposers</b> increased and root herbivores had no effect on productivity, but in combination the additive effects canceled each other out. AMF reduced total root biomass by 18 %, but <b>decomposers</b> increased it by 25 %, leading to no net effect on total root biomass in the combined treatments. Total shoot biomass was reduced by 14 % by root herbivores and affected by an interaction between AMF and <b>decomposers</b> where <b>decomposers</b> had a positive impact on shoot growth only in presence of AMF. AMF increased the shoot biomass of forbs, but reduced the shoot biomass of grasses, while root herbivores only reduced the shoot biomass of grasses. Interactive effects of the soil organisms were detected on the shoot biomasses of Lotus corniculatus, Plantago lanceolata, and Agrostis capillaris. The C/N ratio of the plant community was affected by AMF. In soil, AMF promoted abundances of bacterial, actinomycete, saprophytic and AMF fatty acid markers. <b>Decomposers</b> alone decreased bacterial and actinomycete fatty acids abundances but when <b>decomposers</b> were interacting with herbivores those abundances were increased. Our results suggests that at higher resolutions, i. e. on the levels of individual plant species and the microbial community, interactive effects are common but do not affect the overall productivity and nutrient uptake of a grassland plant community, which is mainly affected by additive effects of functionally dissimilar soil organisms.

2500|$|Because the urea {{conversion}} is incomplete, {{the product}} must {{be separated from}} unchanged ammonium carbamate. In early [...] "straight-through" [...] urea plants this was done by letting down the system pressure to atmospheric to let the carbamate decompose back to ammonia and carbon dioxide. Originally, {{because it was not}} economic to recompress the ammonia and carbon dioxide for recycle, the ammonia at least would be used for the manufacture of other products, for example ammonium nitrate or sulfate. (The carbon dioxide was usually wasted.) Later process schemes made recycling unused ammonia and carbon dioxide practical. This was accomplished by depressurizing the reaction solution in stages (first to 18–25 bar and then to 2–5 bar) and passing it at each stage through a steam-heated carbamate <b>decomposer,</b> then recombining the resultant carbon dioxide and ammonia in a falling-film carbamate condenser and pumping the carbamate solution into the previous stage.|$|E
2500|$|A central {{question}} in the trophic dynamic literature {{is the nature of}} control and regulation over resources and production. Ecologists use simplified one trophic position food chain models (producer, carnivore, <b>decomposer).</b> Using these models, ecologists have tested various types of ecological control mechanisms. For example, herbivores generally have an abundance of vegetative resources, which meant that their populations were largely controlled or regulated by predators. This is known as the top-down hypothesis or 'green-world' hypothesis. Alternatively to the top-down hypothesis, not all plant material is edible and the nutritional quality or antiherbivore defenses of plants (structural and chemical) suggests a bottom-up form of regulation or control. Recent studies have concluded that both [...] "top-down" [...] and [...] "bottom-up" [...] forces can influence community structure and the strength of the influence is environmentally context dependent. These complex multitrophic interactions involve more than two trophic levels in a food web.|$|E

40|$|Ecological {{stoichiometry}} postulates that differential nutrient {{recycling of}} {{elements such as}} nitrogen and phosphorus by consumers can shift the element that limits plant growth. However, this hypothesis has so far considered the effect of consumers, mostly herbivores, out of their food-web context.

In this theoretical study, we investigate how <b>decomposers</b> determine the nutrient that limits plants, both by feeding on nutrients and organic carbon released by plants and consumers, and by being fed upon by omnivorous consumers. We show that <b>decomposers</b> can greatly alter the relative availability of nutrients for plants.
