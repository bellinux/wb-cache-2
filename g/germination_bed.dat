The germination characteristics such as germination rate, germinating, germination index, vigor index, and activity changes of amylase and protease were determinated by <b>germination</b> <b>bed</b> method.

With the increase of extract concentration of disused battery, the vigor index based on germination rate at 72 h dropped, which indicated that the decrement was more pronounced than germination index of that.

A research has been conducted at the University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine Cluj-Napoca, Romania. The use of minimum soil tillage systems within a three years rotation: maize, soya-bean, wheat favorites the rise of the aggregates hydro stability with 5. 6 - 7. 5 % on a 0 - 20 cm depth and 5 - 11 % on 20 - 30 cm depth.

In this interview with Ebenezar Asaah of the World Agroforestry Centre in Cameroon, Martha Chindong asks what practical steps communities can follow {{to set up a}} nursery of their own, closer to home. IN:	?Well a few simple steps that [...] . OUT:	?and meet such an order. ? DUR?N:	 2 ? 40 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Martha Chindong speaking to Ebenezar Asaah of the World Agroforestry Centre in Cameroon. If you want to set up your own nursery, make sure you have a clear idea of what purpose you want it to serve, and enough space for all the stores you will need to set up. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Asaah	Well a few simple steps that a community could use to set up a community nursery. The first thing is they have to have a very clear objective of {{what they want to do}} about setting a nursery, because a nursery, it should be like a long term venture, it should not just be a short one-off thing. That is the first thing, so you have to define it. They could think about producing plants and others could come and buy. So you have to do some prospection have a long-term view of what you want to do, having a clear objective. The next thing, the community should be willing to participate materially and equally in kind, because this is very important for the ownership of that nursery. If the community can spare their land, they come in and work with you, and what they don?t have that is what you bring in. You find that there is a win-win situation. The next thing is that you have to identify an ideal site. The most suitable site should be where you have a permanent water source. And the area or the site should be secure. Then there are other issues like constructing the shed house of the nursery, especially if you are going to carry out vegetative propagation you will need propagators. We are going to have areas to germinate seed so you have <b>germinations</b> <b>beds,</b> you are going to have weaning sheds after your plants start getting mature before you plant them into the field you need to wean them gradually. And then of course you need a store, a secured store where you can store your small equipment which you use like the wheel barrows, the spades. Chindong	So who takes the decisions, who makes the decision as regards to what type of fruit trees we are going to plant in the nursery when it comes to a community nursery? Asaah	In a community nursery the decision rests on the community. You find that the choice of the species is often guided by the farmers and the market forces of the products. It has to fulfil his nutritional benefits first and it is the excess that he is now thinking of selling. Those that want to develop a long term nursery they have to run it as a farmer enterprise. And in that way they have to have a clear vision of what they want, that is why we talk of clear objectives. And so that is why we give them that training to develop their business plans, we support them to have knowledge on book keeping so that they could record the plans they produce, and now from the business plan they can actually predict what they are going to produce and respect if there is a command, somebody places an order of plants, they can actually respect and meet such an order. End of track. How to make the most of your nursery...|$|R
40|$|The forest {{has been}} very useful to man as he obtains food, shelter, revenue, energy etc. from it. However, {{increase}} in demand for forest products has resulted in over exploitation and extinction of some forest trees. Therefore, there is an urgent need of supplying improved seeds for afforestation and forest regeneration in various forestry establishments. Nursery experiment was carried out to investigate the effect of provenance and soil type on the growth of Tectona grandis. Seeds were collected from different locations in three different states namely: Ekiti, Osun and Oyo State. Seeds were collected from Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State; Iwo, Osun State and Ibadan, Oyo State. The seeds were pre-treated by soaking in the stream for two weeks before planting. The seeds were broadcasted on a <b>germination</b> <b>bed</b> at the college nursery and later, were transplanted into polythene pots containing the different soil types. The parameters assessed include total height, stem diameter and leaf production. Tectona grandis seeds collected from Oyo State and grown on loamy soil (T 6) gave the best result in both total height and stem diameter (10. 22 cm and 0. 20 cm respectively) while Teak seeds collected from Oyo State and raised on sandy soil gave the best result for leaf count (8. 17). The seeds collected from Oyo State performed better on sandy soil, best on loamy soil and less on clay soil. Seeds collected from Ekiti performed well in total height on loamy soil (9. 48 cm), in stem diameter on sandy soil (0. 17 cm) and in number of leaves both in sandy and clay soil (7. 25). The seeds collected from Osun State performed well in total height and stem diameter on loamy soil (9. 97 cm and 0. 19 cm respectively) and had the same value for number of leaves in the three soil samples (7. 08). Based {{on the findings of}} this work, it is hereby recommended that Tectona grandis seedlings should be raised using loamy soil at nursery stage. Also seeds of Tectona grandis should be collected from a location of similar geographical properties...|$|E
30|$|This pot {{study was}} visualized with the {{observation}} to monitor Caladium growth {{and find out}} some good combination of potting media to have the positive effect on crop growth. It was observed from this experiment that vegetative growth and plant biomass were positively affected when plants grown under all different media concentration than control. However, the comparative performance of all potting combination showed that T 8 (silt+leaf compost+perlite) and T 7 (silt+leaf compost+coconut compost) were approved to be most suitable mixture which significantly improve the overall growth and biomass of Caladium. Soilless potting substrates are commonly used for better seedling growth and quick <b>germination</b> in greenhouse <b>bedding</b> and potted plants (Baiyeri 2003; Younis et al. 2008). From this experiment, it was perceived that potting media {{with a combination of}} organic (leaf manure) and inorganic (perlite) with silt reduced the mean germination time and showed fast bulb growth compared to other media combinations and control treatment. It can be concluded that the combinations of the above growing media are best because different media are rich in different nutrients and multi-nutrient substrates are good for the soil chemical, physical and biological properties. In different plant species early sprouting depends upon the air, water content and temperature of the medium (Guerin et al. 2001). Similar findings were observed by Shah et al. (2006) where FYM, leaf compost and silt at 1 : 1 : 1 ratio as growing substrate for Ficus binnendijkii c.v. Amstel Queen gave highest sprouting percentage. Results are also in accordance with the outcomes of Riaz et al. (2008) who observed the early seedling germination in Zinnia elegans under influence of silt, compost, and leaf manure media. It is suggested to use balanced potting substrates for ornamental plants in order to get maximum plant height. All potting media combinations showed highly significant effect for this growth character. The highest stimulatory effect and the maximum enhancement in plant height was noticed in pots mixed with silt, perlite, and leaf manure in 1 : 1 : 1 ratio as a potting media (Table  1). This combination performed best because in this combination pH and amount of nitrogen was optimum, these finding are in relation with the findings of Grassoti et al. (2003), they found that Lilium as a cut flower give maximum plant height when different media were used as potting substrate. Results also showed that different media with different combinations have more effects on plant height. Treder (2008) also confirmed the above findings where plants attained maximum height when grown in media containing perlite.|$|R
