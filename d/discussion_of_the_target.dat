50|$|A {{marketing}} {{plan is a}} comprehensive document or blueprint that outlines a business advertising and marketing efforts for the coming year. It describes business activities involved in accomplishing specific marketing objectives within a set time frame. A {{marketing plan}} also includes {{a description of the}} current marketing position of a business, a <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> market and a description of the marketing mix that a business will use to achieve their marketing goals. A marketing plan has a formal structure, but {{can be used as a}} formal or informal document which makes it very flexible. It contains some historical data, future predictions, and methods or strategies to achieve the marketing objectives. Marketing plans start with the identification of customer needs through a market research and how the business can satisfy these needs while generating an acceptable level of return. This includes processes such as market situation analysis, action programs, budgets, sales forecasts, strategies and projected financial statements. A marketing plan can also be described as a technique that helps a business to decide on the best use of its resources to achieve corporate objectives. It can also contain a full analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of a company, its organization and its products.|$|E

To the extent that the independent …nancial status of individual Federal Reserve Banks is meaningful, the ISA is the means by which each Bank grants credit to the other Banks in the System. Even if one views …nancial independence as more apparent than real, the behavior of individual Reserve Bank balance sheet components, including ISA, can shed light on ongoing …nancial developments in the economy. This article provides an introduction to the ISA and traces the behavior of ISA and some other components of Reserve Bank balance sheets during the Great Recession and the …nancial crisis. In addition, it provides some speculative discussion of how Reserve Bank balance sheets could be informative about economic conditions as the Fed exits from unconventional monetary policy. The ISA may seem like an obscure topic.

40|$|The Treasury Regulations’ {{concept of}} “substantial {{economic}} effect” is {{the holy grail}} of partnership special allocations. Special allocations that have substantial economic effect will come within a safe harbor in the regulations and have assurance that the allocations that are provided in the partnership agreement will be respected. In order for the allocations to come within the substantial economic effect safe harbor, the partnership must (1) maintain capital accounts {{in accordance with the}} Treasury Regulations’ standard; (2) provide for liquidation in accordance with capital accounts in all events; and (3) either (a) provide for a deficit restoration obligation (DRO) on the partners, so that they have an obligation to restore any deficits in their capital accounts, or, (b) in the alternative, include in the agreement a qualified income offset provision (“QIO”), so that if a partner’s capital account drops below zero because of an “unexpected distribution,” the partner who experiences this circumstance will be allocated a sufficient amount of the partnership’s gross income to raise his capital account to zero. These requirements are sometimes referred to as the “Big Three. ” The Treasury Regulations, by virtue of these safe harbor requirements, effectively push drafters to write allocation sections of partnership agreements to comply with these requirements, which the Article refers to as the Treasury Capital Account Method of Allocation. An alternative approach to drafting allocation provisions is sometimes referred to as the “Target Capital Account Method of Allocation” or more simply the “Target Method. ” Under the Target Method, all distributions are made in accordance with the partnership distribution provisions. Even though capital account balances are maintained for the partnership {{in the same manner as}} under the Treasury Capital Account Method, partners’ capital accounts do not govern the distributions upon liquidation of the partnership, which they do under the Treasury Method. Rather, distribution provisions determine liquidation distributions without regard to the partners’ capital accounts. However, allocations of income, gain, losses and deductions are made and affect capital account balances in a manner so that the capital accounts reflect liquidation distribution priorities. This Article discusses both methods and argues in favor of the superiority of the Target Method in both achieving the economic goals of the partners and in achieving the overriding purposes of the Section 704 (b) special allocation regulations. It sets forth and analyzes several situations in which the two allocation methods diverge in liquidation distribution results and explains how the Treasury Capital Account Method may fail to carry out the economic deal of the partners whereas the Target Method always does. In the course of the <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Target</b> Method, the Article addresses several important interpretive issues in the current Treasury Regulations that inject unfortunate doubt regarding the acceptability of Target Method allocations for partnerships that desire certainty that their allocations will be respected, which drafters of allocation provisions should be aware of and appreciate. The Article ultimately recommends revision of the partnership special allocation regulations to safe-harbor Target Method allocations...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (DLitt (Afrikaans and Dutch)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. This study {{reports on}} a metalexicographical {{investigation}} into contextual guidance in Afrikaans translation dictionaries. The problem that {{gives rise to the}} need for such an investigation is demonstrated from a practical perspective, after which attention is paid to determining the genuine purpose of a dictionary by looking at the component parts of the concept, i. e. the typological placement and the target user group of the dictionary in question. The <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> user group evolves into an in-depth look at the user aspect, which results in the development and presentation of the model of lexicographical parameters for user-friendly dictionaries. This model aims to provide a scientific description of lexicographical user friendliness. Existing proposed definitions of the genuine purpose of a dictionary coupled with the benefit of insights derived from the model of lexicographical parameters for user-friendly dictionaries make the presentation of a new definition of the genuine purpose of a (translation) dictionary possible, which is followed by defining a polyfunctional translation dictionary for Southern Africa. Attention is also paid to some macrostructural issues pertaining to standard translation dictionaries, among others vertical and horizontal alphabetical macrostructures and niching and nesting as manifestations of horizontal alphabetical macrostructures. With regard to nesting, the classification of first and second level nesting is expanded by the description of third and fourth level nesting. The influence of the organisation plan and the dictionary conceptualisation plan on the selection of lexical items for the macrostructure of a standard dictionary is touched upon. An in-depth evaluation of contextual guidance in Afrikaans standard translation dictionaries follows the exposition of the rationale for it and the definitions of the terms context, contextualisation and contextual guidance. The discussion produces the identification of the types of contextualising entries, among others meaning explanations, lexicographical labels and glosses, which fall under the main class of discriminators and which in turn functions alongside the main classes of cotext entries and inserted texts. Each type and subtype is studied meticulously, and distribution structures are determined and evaluated through the study of dictionary data. The study of the data also results in the identification of different levels of contextualisation as well as different types of translation equivalent paradigms. The discussion of lexicographical labels takes on the form of a critical overview of the existing literature on this topic and results in the presentation of a new and scientifically sounder model for the description of labelling in dictionaries in general, i. e. the deixis model. The study of contextualising entries is followed by a discussion of certain elements of the composition of dictionary articles that can support successful contextual guidance, i. e. types of microstructures and the rapid internal access structure. The in-depth study of contextualisation makes the revision of the definition for the term contextualising entry possible. Ultimately a practical model for more effective contextual guidance in polyfunctional Afrikaans translation dictionaries is presented in three main components, i. e. (i) standards for the application of contextual entries, (ii) the proposal of an adapted rapid internal access structure, and (iii) the effective application of functional types of microstructures. The requirements of lexicographical accountability and user-friendliness remain central motives throughout the study...|$|E

These orientation-orbifold string systems provide twisted, multisector generalizations of ordinary critical open-closed bosonic string systems [...] each such system exhibiting a unique graviton. Furthermore, each sector σ of these string systems shows the following properties: a) 26 effective degrees of freedom, b) a Lorentzian space-time with space-time dimension D(σ) ≤ 26, c) an SO(D(σ) - 1, 1) -invariant ordinary string subsystem with quantized intercept less than or equal one, and d) an extra set of (26 -D(σ)) twisted fields which are SO(D(σ) - 1, 1) scalars. Subexamples of non-tachyonic strings and four-dimensional strings are noted. Additionally, we discuss certain subsets of physical states of these theories, concluding that these investigations are so far consistent with the no-ghost conjecture for all the Lorentzian orbifold-string theories of permutation-type.

Until {{a few years ago}} only neurons, but not glial cells, were considered as targets for peptide hormones. Our recent observation that peptide hormones do indeed act on glial cells is extended by the present report that these cells respond to the calcaemic peptide hormones parathyrin and calcitonin. In cultured murine brain cells mainly consisting of glioblasts, parathyrin stimulates <b>the</b> accumulation <b>of</b> cyclic AMP. <b>The</b> half-maximal effect is elicited at 30 nM parathyrin.

Forty-one municipalities and 100 census tracts were surveyed. These were selected by probabilistic stratified cluster sampling in two stages. The strata were formed by grouping the municipalities according to their populations and living conditions. The Pasteur São Paulo Technique was used to obtain data on the canine population. This technique was developed to estimate and classify dogs according to their degree of dependence and restriction. Results Almost 53 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20, 958 households visited owned a dog, and the average was 1. 6 dogs per household.

40|$|The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on 2003 Archaea: Ecology, Metabolism and Molecular Biology {{was held}} at Proctor Academy, Andover, NH from August 3 - 8, 2003. The Conference was well-attended with 150 {{participants}} (attendees list attached). The attendees represented <b>the</b> spectrum <b>of</b> endeavor in this field coming from academia, industry, and government laboratories, both U. S. and foreign scientists, senior researchers, young investigators, and students. In designing the formal speakers program, {{emphasis was placed on}} current unpublished research and <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> future <b>target</b> areas in this field. There was a conscious effort to stimulate lively discussion about the key issues in the field today. Time for formal presentations was limited in <b>the</b> interest <b>of</b> group <b>discussions.</b> In order that more scientists could communicate their most recent results, poster presentation time was scheduled. Attached is a copy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> formal schedule and speaker program and the poster program. In addition to these formal interactions, ''free time'' was scheduled to allow informal discussions. Such discussions are fostering new collaborations and joint efforts in the field. I want to personally thank you for your support of this Conference. As you know, in <b>the</b> interest <b>of</b> promoting <b>the</b> presentation <b>of</b> unpublished and frontier-breaking research, Gordon Research Conferences does not permit publication of meeting proceedings. If you wish any further details, please feel free to contact me. Thank you, Dr. Richard F. Shand, 2003 Conference Chair...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} describes <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> {{a manufacturing}} process and <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> Cu EOS <b>targets.</b> <b>The</b> development <b>of</b> a manufacturing process for these targets required {{a great deal}} <b>of</b> research, because <b>the</b> specifications for <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> required a level of precision {{an order of magnitude}} beyond Target Fabrication's capabilities at the time. Strict limitations on <b>the</b> dimensions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> components and the interfaces between them required research efforts to develop bonding and deposition processes consistent with a manufacturing plan with a dimensional precision on <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> 0. 1 {micro}m. Several months into this effort, the specifications for <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> were relaxed slightly as a result <b>of</b> <b>discussions</b> between <b>the</b> <b>Target</b> Fabrication Group and the physicists. <b>The</b> level <b>of</b> precision required for these targets remained an order of magnitude beyond previous capabilities, but the changes made it possible to manufacture <b>targets</b> to <b>the</b> specifications.

An attractive strategy to increase <b>the</b> therapeutic index <b>of</b> a drug is to specifically deliver the therapeutic molecule in its active form, not only into target tissue, nor even to target cells, but more importantly, into <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> organelle, ie, to its intracellular therapeutic active site.

40|$|While Irish has State {{support in}} <b>the</b> Republic <b>of</b> Ireland, and is taught as a {{compulsory}} school subject from school entry, {{there is growing}} concern about {{a decline in the}} standard attained in this threatened minority language. <b>The</b> majority <b>of</b> Irish children begin learning Irish as a second language at school entry, and are expected to become literate in both English and in Irish over <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> their primary school years. <b>The</b> achievement <b>of</b> this biliteracy is to some extent taken for granted, with a tendency in recent years to focus more on developing oral skills and to view literacy in Irish as a lower priority, which results in less analysis of ways to support reading in Irish. While Irish now uses the same script as English, its orthographic system differs significantly from English and poses considerable challenges. An outline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teaching <b>of</b> Irish reading is given, and a brief outline of challenging features of Irish orthography.

5|$|A review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book in <b>the</b> Leiden Journal <b>of</b> International Law by Tamás Hoffmann {{recommends}} {{the work to}} multiple potential readers, including those who engage in targeting killing, academics, and students. Hoffmann calls it a well-researched monograph and helpful reference work on the subject. The review places the book within <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> addressing legal issues inherent in debating <b>the</b> murky concept <b>of</b> <b>targeted</b> killing. Hoffmann states the book furthers prior attempts {{to come to a}} resolution on <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> <b>the</b> practice's legality. Helen Durhan praises <b>the</b> writing quality <b>of</b> Melzer's work, in a review for the Australian Year Book of International Law. Durhan writes the work is organized in an easily readable format and covers the topic with neutrality. She goes on to call the book a work representing the need for concerned discussion prior to implementing any policy involved in eliminating people. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> author's focus throughout the work, Durhan observes that <b>the</b> author handles <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legality <b>of</b> <b>targeted</b> killing in a clear and precise manner. The review concludes Melzer's thorough analysis goes a long way towards furthering scholars' impressions of legal issues surrounding when it is permitted for sovereign governments to kill people.|$|R

40|$|Service-learning helps {{students}} experience <b>the</b> practical applications <b>of</b> learning to write well; {{it also offers}} {{opportunities for students to}} develop a sense of civic responsibility. Although service-learning is growing in popularity, this pedagogy is not prevalent in English departments. Additionally, service-learning courses across all disciplines typically do not empower students to make their own project decisions. Given these tendencies, it is useful to consider whether service-learning is an effective pedagogy for writing, whether students should be designing their own projects, and what writing instructors could do to facilitate students 2 ̆ 7 growth as writers while completing projects in the community. This is a qualitative case study, incorporating quantitative data, of two technical writing courses. I reviewed the students 2 ̆ 7 answers to surveys developed for this research, plus their course evaluations, individual reflective writing, and collaborative project documents, and then I compiled and collated the students 2 ̆ 7 references to what they were learning and what they were struggling with. The references fall within the following themes: student decision-making; <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instructor; <b>the</b> rhetorical tenets <b>of</b> audience and purpose; service; collaboration with peers and community members; written expression; and professionalism and motivation. Relying upon the students 2 ̆ 7 comments in regard to these themes, I suggest that service-learning can help students become invested in <b>the</b> outcome <b>of</b> their written expression, motivating them to learn how to address audience and purpose through strong writing. Students learn to work collaboratively and develop their own individual voices as they discover, reflect upon, and express their ideas and shared knowledge. Instructors should ask students to design their own projects, allowing them to engage with and learn how to contribute to the community: through self-directed experiential projects, students become more likely to understand <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> writing and to transfer their new knowledge to later situations. I conclude with a <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> need for <b>targeted</b> research and suggestions for teaching writing through community-based pedagogy to enhance civic engagement...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Purpose: The purpose this {{dissertation}} was {{to explore}} discourses of workplace bullying and workplace bullying management used by managers of hospital nursing units, the hospitals {{in which they were}} employed, and agencies responsible for regulating these hospitals. Methods: The study was conducted in Washington State. Data for managerial discourses were collected via interviews with fifteen hospital nursing unit managers. Interview data were analyzed using Willig's Foucauldian Discourse Analysis. Data for organizational discourses were collected from documents that were produced by the seven hospitals in which managers worked. Data for regulatory agencies came from official websites for agencies responsible for regulating hospital workplaces. Hospital and regulatory agency documents were analyzed using Fairclough's Critical Discourse Analysis. Results: Analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hospital (n= 14) and regulatory agency (n= 8) documents indicated there was no common label for bullying-type behaviors within or across the documents. In these documents, discourses of patient safety were mentioned more often than occupational safety discourses. <b>Discussions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> needs <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> of bullying were minimal. Analysis of managerial discourse revealed that bullying was characterized as an interpersonal issue attributable to both <b>the</b> <b>target</b> and <b>the</b> perpetrator, an intrapersonal issue related to characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> perpetrator, or an ambiguous situation that was difficult to classify. Two discourses of managing bullying were identified: bullying that was <b>the</b> responsibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> staff to resolve and bullying that was the manager's responsibility to resolve. Actions that were available to managers in the discourse included doing nothing, actions other than progressive guidance, and progressive guidance. When managerial discourses were compared with hospital organizational discourses, differences were found in the words used to label bullying-type behaviors, <b>the</b> assignment <b>of</b> responsibilities for managers and staff, and the actions available to managers within the discourse. Conclusions: This study {{is believed to be the}} first to examine discourses of workplace bullying from hospital documents, regulatory agencies, and hospital nursing unit managers. The results indicate that obstacles to <b>the</b> resolution <b>of</b> workplace bullying include omission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> needs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> from <b>the</b> documents. Managerial actions in response to complaints of bullying were dependent upon their characterization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incident. Differences in managerial and hospital discourses allow managers to address bullying in ways not sanctioned by their organization...|$|R
