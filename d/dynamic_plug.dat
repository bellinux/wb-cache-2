SesaME supports {{a multitude of}} highly distributed applications and facilitates simultaneous adaptation to individual users and their environment. The dynamic multi-domain dialogue processing is supported {{through the use of}} standardised and highly distributed domain descriptions. For fast, runtime handling of these domain descriptions a specially developed, <b>dynamic</b> <b>plug</b> and play solution is employed.

40|$|In this paper, {{charging}} {{effect of}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>Plug</b> in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) {{is presented in}} a renewable energy based electricity distribution system. For planning and designing a distribution system, PHEVs {{are one of the}} most important factor as it is going to be a spinning reserve of energy, and also a major load for distribution network. A dynamic load model of PHEVs is introduced here based on third order battery model. To determine the system adequacy, it is necessary to do a micro level analysis to know the PHEVs load impact on grid. Scope of such analysis will cover the performance of wind and solar generation with dynamic PHEVs load, as well as the stability analysis of the power grid to demonstrate that it is important to consider the dynamics of PHEVs load in a renewable energy based distribution network...|$|E
40|$|Ferrofluid plug {{was first}} used as valve and {{actuator}} to circumvent the evaporation of aqueous fluid in LOC. Moreover, this <b>dynamic</b> <b>plug</b> catered for aqueous fluid expansion during its heating in the microchannel. Whole-cell polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol was successfully implemented in a magnetically actuated closed-loop PCR microchip system. Here, the ferrofluid plug was used to reduce the evaporation of the PCR sample in the thermal lysis step. A whole-cell PCR model was used to demonstrate this concept. The DNA plasmid, pUC 19, was transformed into DH 5 a competent cells. Primer pairs were designed to amplify region of interest in pUC 19. The transformants were cultured and selected. Whole-cell PCR was performed on intact bacteria to screen {{for the presence of}} pUC 19, containing the region of interests. Serial dilutions demonstrated the limit of detection for this system to be four bacterial cells. PCR amplifications were verified with regular thermocyclers and results were comparable.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{coupling}} Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) with Computerized Prescriber Order Entry (CPOE) and their <b>dynamic</b> <b>plugging</b> {{in the medical}} Workflow Management System (WfMS). First, {{in this paper we}} argue some existing CDSS representative {{of the state of the}} art in order to emphasize their inability to deal with coupling with CPOE and medical WfMS. The multi-agent technology is at the basis of our proposition since (i) it provides natural abstractions to deal with distribution, heterogeneity and autonomy which are inherent to the previous systems (CDSS, CPOE and medical WfMS), and (ii) it introduces powerful concepts such as organizations, goals and roles useful to describe in details the coordination of the different components involved in these systems. In this paper, we also propose a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to support the coupling CDSS with CPOE. Finally, we show how we integrate the proposed MAS in the medical workflow management system which is also based on collaborating agentsComment: International Conference on Information Technology and e-services, ICITeS' 12, IEEE, March 24 - 26,Sousse-Tunisia, 201...|$|R
40|$|PureVision Technology, Inc. (PureVision) was the {{recipient}} of a $ 200, 000 Invention and Innovations (I&I) grant from the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) to complete prepilot tasks in order to scale up its patented biomass fractionation pretreatment apparatus from batch to continuous processing. The initial goal of the I&I program, as detailed in PureVision's original application to the DOE, was to develop the design criteria to build a small continuous biomass fractionation pilot apparatus utilizing a retrofitted extruder with a novel screw configuration to create multiple reaction zones, separated by <b>dynamic</b> <b>plugs</b> within the reaction chamber that support the continuous counter-flow of liquids and solids at elevated temperature and pressure. Although the ultimate results of this 27 -month I&I program exceeded the initial expectations, some of the originally planned tasks were not completed due to a modification of direction in the program. PureVision achieved its primary milestone by establishing the design criteria for a continuous process development unit (PDU). In addition, PureVision was able to complete the procurement, assembly, and initiate shake down of the PDU at Western Research Institute (WRI) in Laramie, WY during August 2003 to February 2004. During the month of March 2004, PureVision and WRI performed initial testing of the continuous PDU at WRI...|$|R
40|$|Chutes are {{commonly}} used to re-direct the flow of bulk solids at interchange points in a conveyor assembly. Requirements for the efficient handling of material at high tonnage rates place constraints on chute design. Poor design can result in chute blockages, both static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>plugging,</b> spillage, and reductions in chute conveyor belt life due to uncontrolled wear. Particle attrition often occurs, leading to unwanted dust generation and degradation of material. Numerical modelling of material flow in a transfer chute can help prevent costly mistakes by identifying poor flow properties in the design or implementation of the chute prior to it being put into operation. The entire system is rarely studied as a whole. Often different models are used separately for the different stages of the flow such as discharge, sliding, impact and free-fall. An alternative is Discrete Element Modelling (DEM) which tracks the motion and interactions of all the individual particles in the bulk material and provides {{a powerful tool for}} studying such complex granular flows. This paper discusses the use of DEM to aid in the design of bulk materials handling transfer chutes and reports on 3 D DEM simulation of material flow in a series of real conveyor assemblies using realistic non-spherical particle shapes. The DEM method is shown to be a useful tool allowing extraction of many selective parameters that are difficult to isolate using a continuum based approach. DEM is also a valuable visualisation tool to better understand the flows in chutes...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of temperature on periodic NOx storage–reduction {{in the presence}} of CO 2 has been investigated. A <b>dynamic</b> <b>plug</b> flow model and experiments performed in a packed bed reactor with a Pt–Ba/¿-Al 2 O 3 powder catalyst (1 wt% Pt and 30 wt% Ba) with different lean/rich cycle timings at different temperatures are compared. The model is based on a multiple storage site mechanism. The rate of NOx storage increases with temperature. NOx storage below 300 °C mainly occurs through NO adsorption as nitrites. The oxidation of nitrites to nitrates by NO 2, with release of NO, is the predominant storage step, and its rate increases with temperature. The number of sites taking part in NOx storage is independent of temperature and cycle time. The reduction of stored NOx with H 2 is efficient. However, with an increase in temperature, thermal decomposition of nitrites/nitrates results in a decrease of NOx reductio...|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) is a {{gaseous pollutant}} with {{adverse effects on}} {{human health and the}} environment. Industrial chemical processes contribute significantly to CO accumulation in the atmosphere. One of the most important processes for controlling carbon monoxide emissions is the conversion of CO to methanol by catalytic hydrogenation. In this study, the effects of two different flow types on the rate of CO removal along a two-stage hydrogen permselective membrane reactor have been investigated. In the first configuration, fresh synthesis gas flows in the tube side of the membrane reactor co-currently with reacting material in the shell side, so that more hydrogen is provided in the first sections of the reactor. In the second configuration, fresh synthesis gas flows in the tube side of the membrane reactor counter-currently with reacting material in the shell side, so that more hydrogen is provided in the last sections of the reactor. For this membrane system, a one-dimensional <b>dynamic</b> <b>plug</b> flow model in the presence of catalyst deactivation was developed. Comparison between co-current and counter-current configurations shows that the reactor operates with higher conversion of CO and hydrogen permeation rate in the counter-current mode whereas; longer catalyst life is achieved in the co-current configuration. Enhancement of CO removal in the counter-current mode versus the co-current configuration results in an ultimate reduction in CO emissions into the atmosphere.

40|$|The {{determination}} of parameters in dynamical systems, {{on the basis}} of noisy experimental data, is called the parameter estimation problem or inverse problem. In this dissertation, several methods for parameter estimation are derived for systems governed by partial differential equations, so-called distributed parameter systems. The first class of problems, investigated in Chapter II, is that in which the parameters to be estimated are constants. This class of problems is important for it includes most cases of practical interest. Techniques based on gradient optimization, quasilinearization, and collocation methods are developed. A method of determining confidence intervals for parameter estimates is presented, a method which enables one to design experiments (and measurements) that lead to the best estimates of the parameters. The effectiveness of these methods for estimating constant parameters is illustrated through the estimation of the diffusivity in the heat equation, the estimation of the activation energy for a single reaction from <b>dynamic</b> <b>plug</b> flow reactor data, and the estimation of the permeabilities in a two-region reservoir model. The numerical results also show the advantage of using data taken at optimally chosen measurement locations to estimate the parameters. Many physical systems contain spatially varying parameters, for example, the permeability distribution in a petroleum reservoir model. In Chapter III, two approaches are presented for the estimation of spatially varying parameters. The first is a method of steepest descent based on consideration of the unknown parameter vector as a control vector. The second is based on treating the parameter as an additional state vector and employing least square filtering. The key feature of the former method is that the parameters are considered as continuous functions of position rather than as constant in a certain number of spatial regions. This technique may offer significant savings in computing time over conventional gradient optimization methods, such as steepest descent and Gauss-Newton in which the parameters are considered as uniform in a certain number of zones. Two examples are presented to illustrate the use of the method and its comparison to other algorithms. In certain cases, the location of the boundary of a system may not be known, such as the boundary of a petroleum reservoir. In the case of oil reservoirs {{it is very important to}} be able to estimate the area and shape (or the location of the boundary) of a reservoir so that the production policies can be optimized. A method based on the variation of a functional defined on a variable region is developed in Chapter IV. The computational applications of this method are illustrated in determining the locations of the boundaries of a one-dimensional and a two-dimensional petroleum reservoir...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the software {{issues involved in}} combining the best of SpaceWire, such as modularity, high speed, low latency, fault-tolerance, and ease of implementation, with the vast experience of protocol design that has been implemented on Ethernet. We consider how existing Ethernet-based designs can be implemented on SpaceWire networks. Both technologies {{can be used to}} create networks that route packets from source to destination. SpaceWire, however, has a physical layer that has proven easier to build into a Radiation-Hard environment. Ethernet is based on the legacy of a bus and so relies on broadcast with packets visible to all nodes, whereas SpaceWire is entirely point-to-point and allows multiple connections for redundancy which raises issues for broadcast. Issues that will be addressed here, to allow Ethernet to work over SpaceWire, include: converting Ethernet addressing into SpaceWire routing; behavior in the event of faults (which may create a need to re-route); handling broadcast; and considering whether the network topology is static (as in conventional large spacecraft) or <b>dynamic</b> with <b>plug</b> and play (as suggested for responsive space on small satellites, or for the Shuttle/CEV) ...|$|R

In addition, the 2.0 driver added native video mode {{programming}} support for all chipsets from i830 forward. This version added support for automatic video mode detection and selection, monitor hot <b>plug,</b> <b>dynamic</b> extended and merged desktops and per-monitor screen rotation. These features are built into the X.Org 7.3 X server release and will eventually be supported across most of the open source X.Org video drivers.
