5|$|In 2016, Sandoll Communications, Inc. built a <b>Hangul</b> {{version of}} Renault's Renault Life font {{family for the}} company. It {{consists}} of three fonts in three weights (light, regular, bold) and one width in Roman only. The font was designed by Park Ju-seong and Wi Ye-jin, {{under the direction of}} Lee Do-kyung.|$|E
5|$|The UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage {{took place}} in 2003 and South Korea joined the program a year later. In 2005 China {{declared}} some 1200 properties as intangible cultural heritage, with 16 items belonging to the Korean minority of the country, including the traditional wedding ceremony, Arirang (a folk song) and nolttwigi (a traditional seesaw game). The CHA decided that they also had to broaden the scope of intangible heritage to properties {{that do not have}} any designated 'holders', like kimchi, <b>hangul</b> or Goryeo ginseng.|$|E
5|$|The sound {{values of}} {{modified}} Latin letters {{can often be}} derived {{from those of the}} original letters. For example, letters with a rightward-facing hook at the bottom represent retroflex consonants; and small capital letters usually represent uvular consonants. Apart from the fact that certain kinds of modification to the shape of a letter generally correspond to certain kinds of modification to the sound represented, {{there is no way to}} deduce the sound represented by a symbol from its shape (as for example in Visible Speech) nor even any systematic relation between signs and the sounds they represent (as in <b>Hangul).</b>|$|E
5|$|Karas {{is set in}} {{a fictional}} version of Shinjuku, Tokyo. The show {{initially}} showcased larger areas of Tokyo, but the production team felt other animations have featured these areas too many times. Art designer, Hajime Satō created a modern version of the ward infused with a mixture of East Asian cultures. Fictional lettering, resembling Chinese and <b>Hangul</b> characters, fill the billboards and signs. Western gargoyles and Singapore's Merlion statues decorate the streets, and the buildings are modeled on Shinjuku structures of 2003 while blending influences from the Shōwa period. This Shinjuku is populated by humans and Japanese folklore spirits, yōkai. The humans have become indifferent to the yōkais presence, and fail to see them as they go about their lives.|$|E
5|$|Some neighborhoods, such as SoHo, {{which is}} mixed use, {{are known for}} upscale {{shopping}} as well as residential use. Others, such as Greenwich Village, the Lower East Side, Alphabet City and the East Village, have long {{been associated with the}} Bohemian subculture. Chelsea is one of several Manhattan neighborhoods with large gay populations and has become a center of both the international art industry and New York's nightlife. Washington Heights is a primary destination for immigrants from the Dominican Republic. Chinatown has the highest concentration of people of Chinese descent outside of Asia. Koreatown is roughly bounded by 6th and Madison Avenues, between 31st and 33rd Streets, where <b>Hangul</b> (한글) signage is ubiquitous. Rose Hill features a growing number of Indian restaurants and spice shops along a stretch of Lexington Avenue between 25th and 30th Streets which has become known as Curry Hill.|$|E
25|$|During {{the second}} half of the fifteenth century, <b>Hangul</b> was used {{primarily}} by women and the undereducated. It faced heavy opposition from Confucian scholars educated in Chinese, notably Choe Manri, who believed hanja to be the only legitimate writing system. Later kings too were hostile. King Yeonsangun forbade use of <b>Hangul</b> in 1504, during a series of palace purges, after commoners made <b>Hangul</b> posters mocking him, and King Jungjong abolished the <b>Hangul</b> Ministry in 1506. The account of the design of <b>Hangul</b> was lost, and <b>Hangul</b> would not return to common use until the independence of Korea after World War II.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of growing}} Korean {{nationalism}} in the 19th century, the Gabo Reformists' push, {{and the promotion}} of <b>Hangul</b> in schools and literature by Western missionaries, <b>Hangul</b> was adopted in official documents {{for the first time in}} 1894. Elementary school texts began using <b>Hangul</b> in 1895, and the Dongnip Sinmun, established in 1896, was the first newspaper printed in both <b>Hangul</b> and English. Still, the literary elites continued to use Chinese characters, and the majority of the common people remained illiterate at this period.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hangul</b> Jamo (U+1100–U+11FF) and <b>Hangul</b> Compatibility Jamo (U+3130–U+318F) blocks {{were added}} to the Unicode Standard in June 1993 with the release of version 1.1.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hangul</b> Jamo Extended-A (U+A960–U+A97F) and <b>Hangul</b> Jamo Extended-B (U+D7B0–U+D7FF) blocks {{were added}} to the Unicode Standard in October 2009 with the release of version 5.2.|$|E
25|$|The Hunminjeongeum Society in Seoul {{attempts}} {{to spread the}} use of <b>Hangul</b> to unwritten languages of Asia. In 2009, <b>Hangul</b> was unofficially adopted by the town of Bau-Bau, in Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia, to write the Cia-Cia language. A number of Indonesian Cia-Cia speakers who visited Seoul generated large media attention in South Korea, and they were greeted on their arrival by Oh Se-hoon, the mayor of Seoul. It was confirmed in October 2012 that the {{attempts to}} disseminate <b>Hangul</b> in Indonesia failed. But {{there are still some}} people that use <b>Hangul</b> at home or co-officially.|$|E
25|$|In modern Korean dictionaries, all entry {{words of}} Sino-Korean origin are printed in <b>Hangul</b> and listed in <b>Hangul</b> order, with the Hanja given in {{parentheses}} {{immediately following the}} entry word.|$|E
25|$|Han'gŭl in the McCune–Reischauer system. When {{used as an}} English word, it {{is often}} {{rendered}} without the diacritics, <b>hangul,</b> and it is often capitalized as <b>Hangul,</b> as it appears in many English dictionaries.|$|E
25|$|Several {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that the basic letters of <b>hangul</b> were modeled on the 'Phags-pa script of the Mongol Empire, itself a derivative of the Tibetan alphabet, a Brahmi script (see origin of <b>Hangul).</b>|$|E
25|$|The late 16th century, however, saw {{a revival}} of <b>Hangul,</b> with gasa {{literature}} and later sijo flourishing. In the 17th century, <b>Hangul</b> novels became a major genre. By this point spelling had become quite irregular.|$|E
25|$|Hanja {{were the}} sole means of writing Korean until King Sejong the Great {{promoted}} {{the invention of}} <b>Hangul</b> in the 15th century. However, even after the invention of <b>Hangul,</b> most Korean scholars continued to write in hanmun.|$|E
25|$|A {{resemblance}} of ’Phags-pa ꡠ e to <b>Hangul</b> ㅡ ɨ (both horizontal lines), and of ’Phags-pa ꡡ o to <b>Hangul</b> ㅗ o (both horizontal {{lines with}} an upper {{point in the}} middle), would back up Ledyard's theory if a connection were proven.|$|E
25|$|Both Koreas {{have used}} <b>Hangul</b> or mixed <b>Hangul</b> as their sole {{official}} writing system, with ever-decreasing use of Hanja. Beginning in the 1970s, Hanja began {{to experience a}} gradual decline in commercial or unofficial writing in the South due to government intervention, with some South Korean newspapers now only using Hanja as abbreviations or disambiguation of homonyms. There has been widespread debate as {{to the future of}} Hanja in South Korea. North Korea instated <b>Hangul</b> as its exclusive writing system in 1949, and banned the use of Hanja completely.|$|E
25|$|After the Gabo Reform in 1894, the Joseon Dynasty {{and later}} the Korean Empire started to write all {{official}} documents in <b>Hangul.</b> Under the government's management, proper usage of <b>Hangul</b> and Hanja, including orthography, was discussed, until the Korean Empire was annexed by Japan in 1910.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{creation}} of <b>Hangul,</b> people in Korea (known as Joseon at the time) primarily wrote using Classical Chinese alongside native phonetic writing systems that predate <b>Hangul</b> by hundreds of years, including idu, hyangchal, gugyeol, and gakpil. However, due to the fundamental differences between the Korean and Chinese languages, and {{the large number of}} characters needed to be learned, there was much difficulty in learning how to write using Chinese characters for the lower classes, who often didn't have the privilege of education. To assuage this problem, King Sejong created the unique alphabet known as <b>Hangul</b> to promote literacy among the common people.|$|E
25|$|Not {{including}} obsolete letters, {{there are}} 11,172 possible <b>Hangul</b> blocks.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hangul</b> - {{once used}} to write the Cia-Cia {{language}} but the project is no longer active.|$|E
25|$|Korean and English {{are both}} spoken prevalently. Retail signs {{employing}} the <b>Hangul</b> (한글) alphabet are ubiquitous.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Hangul</b> Society, {{founded by}} Ju Si-gyeong, {{announced}} {{a proposal for}} a new, strongly morphophonemic orthography in 1933, which became the prototype of the contemporary orthographies in both North and South Korea. After Korea was divided, the North and South revised orthographies separately. The guiding text for <b>Hangul</b> orthography is called Hangeul Matchumbeop, whose last South Korean revision was published in 1988 by the Ministry of Education.|$|E
25|$|The {{first book}} using <b>Hangul</b> in the West {{was brought to}} Europe by Isaac Titsingh in 1796. His small library {{included}} Sangoku Tsūran Zusetsu (An Illustrated Description of Three Countries) by Hayashi Shihei. This book, {{which was published in}} Japan in 1785, described the Joseon Kingdom and <b>Hangul.</b> In 1832, the Oriental Translation Fund of Great Britain and Ireland supported the posthumous abridged publication of Titsingh's French translation.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Hangul</b> {{alphabet}} {{announced in}} 1446 brought Korean {{reading and writing}} within reach of virtually the entire population.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Hangul</b> {{alphabet}} {{introduced in}} the 15th century was much simpler, and specifically designed for the sounds of Korean.|$|E
25|$|Korean and English {{are both}} spoken prevalently in Koreatown. Retail signs {{employing}} the <b>Hangul</b> (한글) alphabet are ubiquitous.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hangul,</b> {{the first}} and only {{featural}} alphabet in current use for a national language, was promulgated by Sejong in 1444.|$|E
25|$|In {{particular}} the Khitan small script contained phonetic sub-elements {{arranged in a}} square block {{in a manner similar}} to the more sophisticated <b>Hangul</b> system devised later for Korean.|$|E
25|$|A {{featural}} script represents finer detail than an alphabet. Here symbols do {{not represent}} whole phonemes, but rather the elements (features) {{that make up the}} phonemes, such as voicing or its place of articulation. Theoretically, each feature could be written with a separate letter; and abjads or abugidas, or indeed syllabaries, could be featural, but the only prominent system of this sort is Korean <b>hangul.</b> In <b>hangul,</b> the featural symbols are combined into alphabetic letters, and these letters are in turn joined into syllabic blocks, so that the system combines three levels of phonological representation.|$|E
25|$|While both North and South Korea claim 99% literacy, {{government}} {{studies show}} that 25% {{of people in the}} older generation in the South are not completely literate in <b>Hangul.</b>|$|E
25|$|The table below {{lists the}} three {{preceding}} kingdoms, each province's {{name in the}} Roman alphabet, <b>hangul,</b> and hanja, {{as well as the}} provincial capital, and the equivalent modern-day province.|$|E
25|$|Because many {{different}} Hanja—and thus, {{many different}} words written using Hanja—often {{share the same}} sounds, two distinct Hanja words (Hanjaeo) may be spelled identically in the phonetic <b>Hangul</b> alphabet. Since Hanja's language of origin, Chinese, has many homophones, Hanja words became even more homophonic when they came into Korean since Korean lacks a tonal system, which is how Chinese distinguishes many words that would otherwise make them homophonic to each other. For example, while 道, 刀, and 島 are all phonetically distinct in Mandarin, which are pronounced dào, dāo, and dǎo respectively, they are all pronounced do (도) in Korean. Thus, Hanja are often used to clarify meaning, either on their own without the equivalent <b>Hangul</b> spelling, or in parentheses after the <b>Hangul</b> spelling {{as a kind of}} gloss. Hanja are often also used as a form of shorthand in newspaper headlines, advertisements, and on signs, for example the banner at the funeral for the sailors lost in the sinking of ROKS Cheonan (PCC-772).|$|E
25|$|The simpler vowels {{reflect the}} symmetries of hangul: the yin–yang pairs a, eo and o, u are related through inversion, and yotization of a, eo, o, u is {{indicated}} by reflecting the vowel. This creates a different pattern of symmetry than in <b>hangul.</b> The graphically-similar <b>hangul</b> letters i and eu are also related by reflection. The w in wa, wo {{is indicated by}} making {{the left side of}} the block solid, while the i in ui, oe is shown by making the right side solid. However, the diphthongs e, ae and their yotized variants show no such patterns.|$|E
25|$|There is no initial {{version of}} ng. Initial ieung in <b>hangul</b> is not written in Korean Braille. However, the {{expected}} form is reserved {{and may not}} serve other uses, such as punctuation.|$|E
25|$|To make <b>Hangul</b> {{a perfect}} morphophonological {{fit to the}} Korean language, North Korea {{introduced}} six new letters, which {{were published in the}} New Orthography for the Korean Language and used officially from 1948 to 1954.|$|E
