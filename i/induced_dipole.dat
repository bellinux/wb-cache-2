5|$|In {{addition}} to the intrinsic magnetic moment, Ganymede has an <b>induced</b> <b>dipole</b> magnetic field. Its existence is connected with the variation of the Jovian magnetic field near Ganymede. The induced moment is directed radially to or from Jupiter following {{the direction of the}} varying part of the planetary magnetic field. The induced magnetic moment is an order of magnitude weaker than the intrinsic one. The field strength of the induced field at the magnetic equator is about 60 nT—half of that of the ambient Jovian field. The induced magnetic field of Ganymede is similar to those of Callisto and Europa, indicating that Ganymede also has a subsurface water ocean with a high electrical conductivity.|$|E
25|$|This has an {{interesting}} consequence on the {{electric dipole moment}} (EDM) of any particle. The EDM is defined through the shift in the energy of a state when it is put in an external electric field: Δe = d·E + E·δ·E, where d is called the EDM and δ, the <b>induced</b> <b>dipole</b> moment. One important property of an EDM is that the energy shift due to it changes sign under a parity transformation. However, since d is a vector, its expectation value in a state |ψ> must be proportional to | J |ψ>. Thus, under time reversal, an invariant state must have vanishing EDM. In other words, a non-vanishing EDM signals both P and T symmetry-breaking.|$|E

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} become stained from coupling {{with foreign}} molecules, especially from adsorbing gas molecules. The charge exchange, which {{is due to}} the orbital hybridization, occurred in the stained carbon nanotube <b>induces</b> electrical <b>dipoles</b> that consequently vary the electrical conduction of the nanotube. We propose a microscopic model to evaluate the electrical current variation produced by the <b>induced</b> electrical <b>dipoles</b> in a stained zigzag carbon nanotube. It is found that stronger orbital hybridization strengths and larger orbital energy differences between the carbon nanotube and the gas molecules help increasing the <b>induced</b> electrical <b>dipole</b> moment. Compared with the stain-free carbon nanotube, the <b>induced</b> electrical <b>dipoles</b> suppress the current in the nanotube. In the carbon nanotubes with <b>induced</b> <b>dipoles</b> the current increases as a result of increasing orbital energy dispersion via stronger hybridization couplings. In particular, at a fixed hybridization coupling, the current increases with the bond length for the donor-carbon nanotube but reversely for the acceptor-carbon nanotube. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

25|$|If {{no other}} forces are present, {{the point at}} which the force becomes repulsive rather than {{attractive}} as two atoms near one another is called the van der Waals contact distance. This results from the electron clouds of two atoms unfavorably coming into contact. It can be shown that van der Waals forces are of the same origin as the Casimir effect, arising from quantum interactions with the zero-point field. The resulting van der Waals forces can be attractive or repulsive. It is also sometimes used loosely as a synonym for the totality of intermolecular forces. The term includes the force between permanent dipoles (Keesom force), the force between a permanent dipole and a corresponding <b>induced</b> <b>dipole</b> (Debye force), and the force between instantaneously induced dipoles (London dispersion force).|$|E

Computational ab initio methods used have included CCSD(T), MP2 (Møller–Plesset perturbation theory of the second order), CIS and CISD. For heavy atoms, effective core potentials are used to model the inner electrons, so that their contributions {{do not have to be}} individually computed. More powerful computers since the 1990s have made this kind of in silico study much more popular, being much less risky and simpler than an actual experiment.

2500|$|The Electrostatic Model {{developed}} by Dougherty and coworkers describes trends in binding energy based on differences in electrostatic attraction. It {{was found that}} interaction energies of cation-π pairs correlate well with electrostatic potential above the π face of arenes: for eleven Na+-aromatic adducts, the variation in binding energy between the different adducts could be completely rationalized by electrostatic differences. Practically, this allows trends to be predicted qualitatively based on visual representations of [...] {{for a series of}} arenes. It should be noted that electrostatic attraction is not the only component of cation-π bonding. For example, 1,3,5-trifluorobenzene interacts with cations despite having a negligible quadrupole moment. While non-electrostatic forces are present, these components remain similar over a wide variety of arenes, making the electrostatic model a useful tool in predicting relative binding energies. The other “effects” contributing to binding are not well understood. Polarization, [...] and charge-transfer interactions have been implicated; however, energetic trends do not track well with the ability of arenes and cations to take advantage of these effects. For example, if <b>induced</b> <b>dipole</b> was a controlling effect, aliphatic compounds such as cyclohexane should be good cation-π partners (but are not).|$|E
