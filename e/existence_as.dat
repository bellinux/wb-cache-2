5|$|Adopting the {{theories}} of academic historian Patricia Crone as a basis, Holland asserted {{that there was little}} hard evidence for the origins of Islam and asked why it took several decades after the death of Muhammad for his name to appear on surviving documents or artifacts. Arguing that there was little evidence for how the faith was born, he suggested that the city of Mecca {{may not have been the}} real birthplace of Muhammad and Islam, and– while not clearly disputing Muhammad's <b>existence</b> <b>as</b> a real historical figure– claimed that much of the Islamic origin story was later developed in the early years of the Arab Empire.|$|E

Scully, {{with help from the}} Lone Gunmen, looks into Fowley's personal history and informs Mulder that Fowley has been collecting data on alien abductees and traveling to Tunisia every week, although there is no trace of her activities in FBI records. Although Mulder still trusts Fowley, he goes to her apartment to confront her.|$|E
5|$|Ausonia {{began her}} <b>existence</b> <b>as</b> a turbine-powered {{passenger}} steamer, ordered by Italian Sitmar in 1914. The ship {{was built in}} the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg, under construction number 236. At the time, the only German seaplane carrier was the armored cruiser , which carried two planes. The leadership of the German Navy believed that zeppelins were much more effective than seaplanes, both for reconnaissance and attack. Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, the architect of the German Navy, was particularly unimpressed by the performance of fixed-wing aircraft. Nevertheless, the Navy developed several naval aircraft before and during the war, including a pair of seaplane fighters, the W.12 and the W.29, both built by Hansa-Brandenburg. Twin-engined torpedo-floatplanes were also designed.|$|E

5|$|Ava {{was also}} {{underneath}} the NOAA-2 and Nimbus 5 weather satellites. NOAA-2 provided photographs {{that were used}} to estimate Ava's maximum windspeeds. Satellite images were useful throughout the cyclone's <b>existence,</b> <b>as</b> did the wind reports of three ships when Ava was a young tropical storm. Nimbus 5 carried an Electrically Scanning Microwave Radiometer and Temperature-Humidity Infrared Radiometer. Both were used to study Ava. The main data provided by the THIR was data indicating cloud temperatures. The ESMR's main data was on rainfall rates, densities, and distributions. The observations also provided confirmation that clouds that are not vertically developed very much can produce tropical rainfall.|$|E
5|$|East Stirlingshire {{has played}} at several grounds over its history. In the club's early <b>existence</b> <b>as</b> Britannia, it played {{one of its}} first known matches at Burnhouse against a Falkirk 2nd XI, which ended in a 7–0 defeat for the team. Burnhouse {{is thought to be}} the {{location}} that was to become Merchiston Park, where the club played many of its matches in the late 19th century. Some home matches were also played at Randyford Park in the town.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of the Lakers, the 1970s were {{characterized}} by a major breakthrough of the league's western franchises. In 1975, after compiling a 48–34 regular-season record, the Golden State Warriors swept the heavily favored Washington Bullets 4–0 in the 1975 NBA Finals. In 1976, the Phoenix Suns, who only enjoyed eight years of <b>existence</b> <b>as</b> a franchise, overcame a losing record early in the season to build a remarkable win streak to finish 42–40. The events culminated in upset victories over the Seattle SuperSonics and the Warriors, before facing Boston in the Finals. The teams split the first four games, before Game 5 went into three overtimes before Boston won 128–126. The Celtics managed to secure their 13th championship quickly after, defeating the Suns 87–80 in Game 6.|$|E

5|$|Sa'd al-Dawla was {{succeeded by}} his son, Sa'id Abu 'l-Fada'il Sa'id al-Dawla, but real power rested {{in the hands}} of Sa'd al-Dawla's former chamberlain, Lu'lu'. Several of the Hamdanid ghilman, resenting the {{influence}} of Lu'lu', went over to the Fatimids, who now launched a sustained offensive against Aleppo under the Turkish general Manjutakin. Only the personal intervention of Basil II in 995 and again in 999 would save the emirate from Fatimid conquest. Warfare lasted until 1000, when a peace treaty was concluded guaranteeing Aleppo's continued <b>existence</b> <b>as</b> a buffer state between the two powers. Finally, in 1002, Lu'lu' assassinated Sa'id al-Dawla and assumed control of Aleppo in his own name.|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{was allowed}} to elect sixteen {{representative}} peers, while Ireland could elect twenty-eight. Those chosen by Scotland sat for a single term, and following each dissolution new Scottish peers were elected. In contrast, Irish representative peers sat for life. Elections for Irish peers ceased when the Irish Free State came into <b>existence</b> <b>as</b> a Dominion in December 1922. However, already-elected Irish peers continued {{to be entitled to}} sit until their death. Elections for Scottish peers ended in 1963, when all Scottish peers obtained the right to sit in the House of Lords.|$|E

In the meantime Superb relieved Bellerophon as a gunnery training ship in late 1919 and the latter was reduced to reserve. Superb was relieved in her turn {{at the end of}} 1919 and was paid off in early 1920.
