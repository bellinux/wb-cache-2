South African musicians were also displeased regarding the lack of native acts scheduled to perform at the FIFA World Cup Kick-Off Celebration Concert on 10 June 2010. They expressed anger towards the South African Football Association (SAFA) for letting international artists like Alicia Keys, the Black Eyed Peas, and Shakira to headline the event. Subsequently, the Creative Workers Union of South Africa planned a demonstration to be held on 15 April, but called it off after SAFA announced that the repertoire of performing acts would be finalised after [...] "consultation with fans and host cities." [...] Danny Jordaan, head of the South African World Cup Organising Committee and president of SAFA, released a statement assuring that [...] "the incredibly talented South African and African music industry will play a major part in the tournament's off-field success and character." [...] Freshlyground's violinist Kyla-Rose Smith defended FIFA's {{decision to}} select [...] "Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)" [...] as the official song, saying: [...] "I think that the World Cup is a global event but it’s also a business, a huge marketing exercise. FIFA requires a musician of a certain global reach to appeal to all the <b>different</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who are involved and witness and watch the World Cup.

2500|$|Florida {{was mostly}} divided between two {{distinct}} culture groups, the Muskogean & the Carib. While {{there were some}} Muskogean tribes along almost the entirety of Florida's east coast, everything else south of Lake Okeechobee was ruled by a Carib nation called the Calusa —Including the Keys. This tribe {{appears to have been}} a powerful trading force in the Caribbean & the chief & his wife were treated almost as if they were a king & queen. They had discovered complex building techniques & built cities of two story communal buildings, as space within the Everglades was scarce. Smaller farming & fishing villages built the more common thatched-roof, stilted huts common amongst the Carib peoples. While they mostly wove their clothing from Spanish moss & made shawls & rugs from dried palm leaves, they also undoubtedly traded for other cloth goods to the north and west, which may have given them access to Hemp [...] & Cotton. The Chief & his wife had their own palace, of sorts, in which they lived & from which they conducted their political business. They were met with the Spanish when they attempted to explore Florida in the 16th century & continued to survive in the region until the mid-18th century, when Spain temporarily lost control of the Florida colony to the English due to the activities of the Creek Confederacy. They were also partially responsible for the mythology surrounding the Fountain of Youth. Later, they conquered some of the other Muskogean peoples—namely the Ais & the Mayaimi [...] (for which the city of Miami is named for, despite the fact that the tribe surrounded Lake Okeechobee), technically making them an Empire, as small as they were. (An Empire is seen as a governing system in which significant populations of <b>different</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> with separate cultural identities are ruled over by a single, ultimate ruler).|$|E

The question itself will be answered in as many different ways as there are <b>different</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> Any prohibitionist {{will tell you that the}} coming of prohibition to England is as certain as the coming eclipse of the sun. But this is always so. It is in human nature that people are impressed by the cause they work in. I once knew a minister of the Scotch Church who took a voyage round the world: he said that the thing that impressed him most was the growth of presbyterianism in Japan. No doubt it did. When the Orillia lacrosse team took their trip to Australia, they said on their return that lacrosse was spreading all over the world. In the same way there is said to be a spread all over the world of Christian Science, proportional representation, militarism, peace sentiment, barbarism, altruism, psychoanalysis and death from wood alcohol. They are what are called world movements.|$|E
60|$|In other words, the semi-tropical {{nature of}} the place, like its vulgarity and desecration, can be, and are, {{enormously}} exaggerated. But it is always hard to correct the exaggeration without exaggerating the correction. It would be absurd seriously to deny that Jerusalem is an Eastern town; but we may say it was Westernised without being modernised. Anyhow, it was medievalised before it was modernised. And {{in the same way}} it would be absurd to deny that Jerusalem is a Southern town, in the sense of being normally {{out of the way of}} snowstorms, but the truth can be suggested by saying that it has always known the quality of snow, but not the quantity. And the quantity of snow that fell on this occasion would have been something striking and even sensational in Sussex or Kent. And yet another way of putting the proportions of the thing would be to say that Jerusalem has been besieged more often and by more <b>different</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> than any town upon the globe; that it has been besieged by Jews and Assyrians, Egyptians and Babylonians, Greeks and Romans, Persians and Saracens, Frenchmen and Englishmen; but perhaps never before in all its agony of ages has it ever really been besieged by winter. In this case it was not only snowed on, it was snowed up.|$|E

As long as you run across Englishmen born this side of three hundred years ago, you are all right; but the minute you get back of Elizabeth's time the {{language}} begins to fog up, and the further back you go the foggier it gets. I had some talk with one Langland and a {{man by the name of}} Chaucer--old-time poets--but it was no use, I couldn't quite understand them, and they couldn't quite understand me. I have had letters from them since, but it is such broken English I can't make it out. Back of those men's time the English are just simply foreigners, nothing more, nothing less; they talk Danish, German, Norman French, and sometimes a mixture of all three; back of THEM, they talk Latin, and ancient British, Irish, and Gaelic; and then back of these come billions and billions of pure savages that talk a gibberish that Satan himself couldn't understand. The fact is, where you strike one man in the English settlements that you can understand, you wade through awful swarms that talk something you can't make head nor tail of.

Over there Susan and Arthur were explaining to Mrs. Paley that an expedition had been proposed; and Mrs. Paley having grasped the fact, gave the advice of an old traveller that they should take nice canned vegetables, fur cloaks, and insect powder. She leant over to Mrs. Flushing and whispered something which from the twinkle in her eyes probably had reference to bugs. Then Helen was reciting [...] "Toll for the Brave" [...] to St. John Hirst, in order apparently to win a sixpence which lay upon the table; while Mr. Hughling Elliot imposed silence upon his section of the audience by his fascinating anecdote of Lord Curzon and the undergraduate's bicycle. Mrs. Thornbury was trying to {{remember the name of}} a man who might have been another Garibaldi, and had written a book which they ought to read; and Mr. Thornbury recollected that he had a pair of binoculars at anybody's service. Miss Allan meanwhile murmured with the curious intimacy which a spinster often achieves with dogs, to the fox-terrier which Evelyn had at last induced to come over to them. Little particles of dust or blossom fell on the plates now and then when the branches sighed above.

6000|$|I take a third case; {{the strangest}} of all, because it {{involves}} the one real objection to the faith. The one real objection to the Christian religion is simply that it is one religion. The world is a big place, full of very <b>different</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> Christianity (it may reasonably be said) is one thing confined to one kind of people; it began in Palestine, it has practically stopped with Europe. I was duly impressed with this argument in my youth, and I was much drawn towards the doctrine often preached in Ethical Societies-- I mean the doctrine {{that there is one}} great unconscious church of all humanity founded on the omnipresence of the human conscience. Creeds, it was said, divided men; but at least morals united them. The soul might seek the strangest and most remote lands and ages and still find essential ethical common sense. It might find Confucius under Eastern trees, and he would be writing [...] "Thou shalt not steal." [...] It might decipher the darkest hieroglyphic on the most primeval desert, and the meaning when deciphered would be [...] "Little boys should tell the truth." [...] I believed this doctrine of the brotherhood of all men in the possession of a moral sense, and I believe it still--with other things. And I was thoroughly annoyed with Christianity for suggesting (as I supposed) that whole ages and empires of men had utterly escaped this light of justice and reason. But then I found an astonishing thing. I found that the very people who said that mankind was one church from Plato to Emerson were the very people who said that morality had changed altogether, and that what was right in one age was wrong in another. If I asked, say, for an altar, I was told that we needed none, for men our brothers gave us clear oracles and one creed in their universal customs and ideals. But if I mildly pointed out that one of men's universal customs was to have an altar, then my agnostic teachers turned clean round and told me that men had always been in darkness and the superstitions of savages. I found it was their daily taunt against Christianity that it was the light of one people and had left all others to die in the dark. But I also found that it was their special boast for themselves that science and progress were the discovery of one people, and that all other peoples had died in the dark. Their chief insult to Christianity was actually their chief compliment to themselves, and {{there seemed to be a}} strange unfairness about all their relative insistence on the two things. When considering some pagan or agnostic, we were to remember that all men had one religion; when considering some mystic or spiritualist, we were only to consider what absurd religions some men had. We could trust the ethics of Epictetus, because ethics had never changed. We must not trust the ethics of Bossuet, because ethics had changed. They changed in two hundred years, but not in two thousand.|$|E
