25|$|At {{one time}} three-pin XLR {{connectors}} {{were also used}} extensively on loudspeaker cables, as when first introduced they represented a new standard of ruggedness, and economic alternatives were not readily available. Often, two-conductor loudspeaker cable had three-pin female connectors on both ends, to distinguish it from a three-conductor shielded signal level cable, which has a female connector {{at one end and}} a male at the other. Either pin 2 or 3 was live, depending on the manufacturer, with pin 1 always the 'earthy' return. This usage is now both obsolete and dangerous to equipment but is still sometimes encountered, especially on older equipment. For example, some loudspeakers have a built-in male connector as an <b>input</b> <b>connector</b> for speaker-level signal. This use was superseded in professional audio applications by the Neutrik Speakon connector.|$|E

50|$|When {{controlled}} by a Series 200 data signal, the VLSR stored the cue information (in {{much the same way}} that Series 200 luminaires did) and transmitted the raw positional and colour information to the luminaires, as Series 300 data. In this case, the Series 200 <b>input</b> <b>connector</b> was used to supply both power and data.When {{controlled by}} a DMX512 data signal, all cue information is stored in and transmitted from the lighting console; with the VLSR simply acting as a translating device, which converts the DMX signal to Series 300 data in real time. In this case, the Series 200 <b>input</b> <b>connector</b> is used only to supply mains power to the VLSR, with DMX data being input via a separate, standard, 5-pin XLR connector.|$|E

50|$|FASTBUS is a crate/module {{standard}} developed {{later than}} the other two for high-speed parallel data acquisition. Rather than individual components, FASTBUS modules tend to be data acquisition modules with many <b>input</b> <b>connectors</b> on the front, while the stored data is read out on the backplane. The connectors {{on the back of a}} FASTBUS module are two parallel pin sockets on the module and pins sticking out of the backplane. The main connector in a FASTBUS crate covers about the bottom 2/3 of the module. There is also an upper connector that consists of pass-through pins to the back side of the backplane; this allows custom modules to be plugged in there.|$|R

While at McCune John first realized his idea of a fully integrated loudspeaker system. The system was built for Creedence Clearwater Revival's last tour. It was a fully integrated tri-amped, horn-loaded system with processing electronics. Three amps were built into a rack mountable enclosure that would drive two speakers. The enclosure also included preset cross-overs and equalization. The outside of the enclosure was simple: an AC cord, <b>input</b> <b>connectors,</b> and 4-pin connectors that plugged into the loudspeakers. The original model did not have level controls or a power switch.|$|R

50|$|Computer speakers, or {{multimedia}} speakers, are speakers {{sold for}} use with computers, although usually capable of other audio uses, e.g. for an MP3 player. Most such speakers have an internal amplifier and consequently require a power source, which may be by a mains power supply often via an AC adapter, batteries, or a USB port (able to supply no more than 2.5W DC, 500mA at 5V). The signal <b>input</b> <b>connector</b> is often a 3.5 mm jack plug (usually color-coded lime green per the PC 99 standard); RCA connectors are sometimes used, and a USB port may supply both signal and power (requiring additional circuitry, and only suitable {{for use with}} a computer). Battery-powered wireless Bluetooth speakers require no connections at all. Most computers have speakers of low power and quality built in; when external speakers are connected they disable the built-in speakers.

50|$|The {{majority}} of today's lock-in amplifiers {{are based on}} high-performance digital signal processing (DSP). Over the last 20 years, digital lock-in amplifiers have been replacing analog models across the entire frequency range, allowing users to perform measurements up to a frequency of 600 MHz. Initial problems of the first digital lock-in amplifiers, e.g. the presence of digital clock noise on the <b>input</b> <b>connectors,</b> could be completely eliminated by use of improved electronic components and better instrument design. Today's digital lock-in amplifiers outperform analog models in all relevant performance parameters, such as frequency range, input noise, stability and dynamic reserve. In addition to better performance, digital lock-in amplifiers can include multiple demodulators, which allows analyzing a signal with different filter settings or at multiple different frequencies simultaneously. Moreover, experimental data can be analyzed with additional tools such as an oscilloscope, FFT spectrum analyzers, boxcar averager or used to provide feedback by using internal PID controllers. Some models of the digital lock-in amplifiers are computer-controlled and feature a graphical user interface (can be a platform-independent browser user interface) and a choice of programming interfaces.|$|R

40|$|We analyze noise {{properties}} of time series of frequency data from different counting modes of a Keysight 53230 A frequency counter. We use a 10 MHz reference signal from a passive hydrogen maser connected via phase-stable Huber+Suhner Sucoflex 104 cables to the reference and <b>input</b> <b>connectors</b> of the counter. We {{find that the}} high resolution gap-free (CONT) frequency counting process imposes long-term correlations in the output data, resulting in a modified Allan deviation that is characteristic of random walk phase noise. Equally important, the CONT mode results in a frequency bias. In contrast, the counter's undocumented raw continuous mode (RCON) yields unbiased frequency stability estimates with white phase noise characteristics, and of a magnitude consistent with the counter's 20 ps single-shot resolution. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a 100 -point running average filter {{in conjunction with the}} RCON mode yields resolution enhanced frequency estimates with flicker phase noise characteristics. For instance, the counter's built-in moving-average function can be used. The improved noise characteristics of the averaged RCON mode versus the CONT mode imply that the former mode yields frequency estimates with improved confidence for a given measurement time.

50|$|A {{pass-through}} connector is {{a second}} jack, sometimes simply paralleled to the <b>input</b> <b>connector,</b> that delivers the input signal unchanged, to allow the DI unit to be inserted into a signal path without interrupting it. This allows a user, such as an electric bass player, to plug their bass into a DI unit, which routes the bass signal to the mixing board, {{and at the same}} time plug the bass into an onstage bass amp for monitoring purposes. Pass-through is also commonly referred to as a bypass. True-bypass occurs when the signal goes straight from the input jack to the output jack with no circuitry involved and no loading of the source impedance. False bypass (or simply 'bypass') occurs when the signal is routed through the device circuitry with buffering and no other intentional change to the signal. However, due to the nature of electrical designs there is almost always some slight change in the signal. The extent of change and how noticeable it may be can vary from unit to unit.|$|E

In North America this variant is often called a [...] "small Tuchel" [...] connector {{after one of the}} major manufacturers. Tuchel is now a division of Amphenol. Additional configurations up to 24 pins are also offered in the same shell size. A version with a bayonet locking ring was used on portable tape recorders, dictation machines and lighting dimmers and controls through the from the 1960's to the 1980's, an example of this is the microphone <b>input</b> <b>connector</b> and some others on the [...] "Report" [...] family of UHER (brand) tape recorders. The bayonet locking version is sometimes referred to by the trade name Preh. Belling Lee offered a version with a sprung-loaded collar which latched on insertion but required the collar to be pulled back to release the connector, similar to the LEMO B series connector. This connector was commonly referred to as the [...] "Bleecon", an example of its use is the Strand Tempus range of theatrical lighting dimmers and control desks. A version with a pushbutton latch similar to that on an XLR cable mounted socket was also available. Female connectors with screw-locking, Bleecon or bayonet latching features are compatible with standard DIN plugs.|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} {{to find the}} individual impulse response of broadband sampling oscilloscopes (HP 54124 T, 50 GHz bandwidth). The method {{is based on the}} fact that, when the oscilloscope is sampling a DC-voltage, pulses are launched from the sampler towards the <b>input</b> <b>connector.</b> These pulses contain information on the scope's characteristic and can be measured by a second oscilloscope. This type of measurement is called a "nose-to-nose" calibration. Applying deconvolution techniques to the result of this measurement the characteristic of the two scopes can be found, assuming that the two scopes are identical. To avoid relying on this assumption, three oscilloscopes can be used. The "nose-to-nose" is then applied three times, with a different pair of scopes connected together each time. The individual characteristics of the three sampling oscilloscopes are then calculated. Both SPICE simulations and close correspondence between swept-sine measurements and this method indicate that it is [...] ...|$|E
5000|$|Below each input, {{there are}} usually several rotary {{controls}} (knobs or [...] "pots"). The first knob is typically a trim or gain control.
