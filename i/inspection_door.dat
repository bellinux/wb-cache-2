50|$|The {{locomotive}} is configured with {{a single}} cab in a middle. The cab has two big windows in both front and rear walls, and doors with single windows in sides. The body has car-like full width hoods over forward and rear sections, with two headlights attached to vertical end walls. In forward section (slightly longer) there is an engine with a water radiator in front and two fuel tanks on sides; in rear section there is a compressor and transmission box. In front wall there is an air-inlet grille with adjustable louvres, in rear wall there are twin <b>inspection</b> <b>doors</b> with slits. Side panels with slits are opening upwards along with roof parts. From 1971 part of PKP locomotives were refitted with the third headlight on a cab's roof. The locomotives usually used one central buffer, with an exception of 785 mm gauge ones, which had twin buffers. Industrial locomotives could have different types of couplings.|$|R

50|$|As fire {{fighting}} arrangement, {{the building has}} one 15-cm diameter riser feeding first-aid hose reels as well as fire extinguishers. For feeding the hose reels, there are two overhead tanks. Connected to the air-conditioning plant is two large vertical shafts located {{at one end of}} the building going up to the roof—one meant for the supply of conditioned air and the other for return air. These shafts are closed at the top except for a small vent. All the floors have false ceilings made of Sitatex boards on wooden frames. The space above the false ceilings is utilised as plenum with three horizontal ducts running through the length of the building acting as supply air ducts. The central duct is of galvanised iron sheets. The side walls, above which the glass facings are fitted, has several openings on the window sills, through grills which communicate with the side ducts in the floor just below. These openings are also for the supply of conditioned air. The plenum as well as supply air ducts connected with vertical shafts are provided with <b>inspection</b> <b>doors</b> made of timber which open out directly to the staircase landings on each floor. At each end, a staircase is provided. The lift shafts are adjoining the vertical air shafts at one end.|$|R
5000|$|When the {{aircraft}} arrived from London earlier that morning, the previous flight crew had reported a frozen door seal and abnormal noises {{coming from the}} right aft service door. They requested a full <b>inspection</b> of the <b>door.</b> The <b>inspection</b> {{was carried out by}} a ground engineer who then performed a pressurization leak check. In order to carry out this check without requiring {{the aircraft}}s engines, the pressurisation system was set to [...] "manual". However, the engineer failed to reset it to [...] "auto" [...] on completion of the test.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, in 1991, an {{incident}} occurred at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport involving the malfunction of a United Airlines Boeing 747 cargo door. At the time, United Airlines' maintenance staff were investigating {{the cause of}} a circuit breaker trip. In the process of diagnosing the cause, an inadvertent operation of the electric door latch mechanism caused the cargo door to open spontaneously despite being closed. An <b>inspection</b> of the <b>door's</b> electrical wiring discovered insulation breaches, and isolating certain electrical wires allowed the door to operate normally again. The lock sectors, latch cams, and latch pins on the door were inspected, and did not show signs of damage of the type predicted by the NTSB's original hypothesis.|$|R
40|$|During {{pressure}} testing on fuselage of an aircraft, {{the boss of}} door assembly edge frame LH top had fractured. The fractured boss {{was sent to the}} laboratory for establishing the cause of failure. Fractographic study revealed that the boss has fractured under bending overload. Examination of the mating fracture surfaces showed that the bending load acted in a direction from inside the aircraft to outside at an angle with the horizontal. Subsequent <b>inspection</b> of the <b>door</b> assembly suggests that the boss in question had experienced excessive bending load due to non-uniform load sharing by the locking pins. It appears most probable that the looseness of the pins in the assembly was the reason for such overload on the boss in question...|$|R
50|$|David Miller, in his History of the Abbey at Arbroath {{written in}} 1860, {{describes}} Hospitalfield House as follows: The older or {{central part of}} the present mansion-house of Hospitalfield is evidently a part of the ancient Abbey hospital. This is proved by the remains of several old doors and other indications about the walls of the house; and especially by one side of an ancient door which was lately discovered during some alterations in the front wall, a few yards west from the modern door, and which the proprietor, with good taste, has caused to be repaired and left open for <b>inspection.</b> This <b>door</b> appears, from the depth and character of its mouldings to {{have been one of the}} principal entrances to the hospital, and to have been erected after the early English style of architecture had ceased to be followed. The spring of the upper stones shews that its head was either a pointed or semicircular arch, having the side mouldings carried round without alteration, and without capitals at the spring of the arch. If our view be correct, these marks denote the erection of the hospital to have been from fifty to a hundred years subsequent to the foundation of the Abbey.|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of this master thesis {{have been to}} model and simulate oxy-combustion CO 2 capture in a cement plant. The model developed is a process simulation of the calcination process with varying degree of air in-leakage, where heat is supplied by combustion in an oxygen rich environment, followed by capture of the CO 2. The further gas separation after H 2 O condensation to achieve the required CO 2 quality was evaluated. In addition to the process simulations, a review of literature related to oxy-combustion CO 2 capture and cement production was performed, and an engineering evaluation of the necessary modifications to the cement plant conducted. A simulation model was built in Aspen HYSYS, and student Jelmer de Winter s project work was utilized as a starting point. The model was developed with the aim to achieve results comparable to a process model constructed by the European Cement Research Academy (ECRA) in 2009. The goal was to capture {{as much of the}} CO 2 as possible, and to achieve a CO 2 purity of minimum 95 mol-% after the CO 2 Compression and Purification Unit (CPU). CO 2 purity in the dry flue gas of ~ 85 mol % was achieved, with a CO 2 capture rate up to 96. 4 %. Five different air in-leakages (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 % of total flue gas flow) were tested. The results showed that the CO 2 concentration in the flue gas decreased with increasing degree of air in-leakage. The decrease in CO 2 concentration causes an increase of the power consumption of the CO 2 CPU of ~ 2. 6 % per percentage point of air in-leakage, and the CO 2 capture rate was also reduced when the air in-leakage increased. These results agree well with results from previous oxy-combustion studies, and show the importance of minimizing air in-leakages in the cement plant. If oxy-combustion capture is to be utilized at a cement plant, some process modifications and additional equipment is required. An Air Separation Unit (ASU) is needed to provide almost pure oxygen for the combustion process. A Compression and Purification Unit (CPU) is also required, in order achieve the necessary CO 2 purity and transport conditions. When using oxy-combustion technology, both the material conversion in the cement kiln system and the operational specifications of the overall process are different from those in conventional kiln operation. However, research made by ECRA in 2012 showed that the negative impacts of oxy-combustion on the product quality seem to be negligible. Other necessary process modifications when retrofitting with oxy-combustion are news design of the kiln burner and the clinker cooler in the cement plant. In addition, prevention of excessive air in-leakage by improving sealing locations at the cement plant is necessary, as the simulation results show. This is possible e. g. by waste gas flushed systems, or by an improved maintenance of <b>inspection</b> <b>doors</b> and similar devices. The CPU is up to a certain point capable of handling changes in the flue gas composition at short-term inspections; however it limits its efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Phil Engelauf, STS- 114 Mission Operations Representative reports: {{the orbital}} {{rendezvous}} was successful, and today's activities includes initial preparations {{of the next}} day's extravehicular activities (EVA); he specifically mentioned tile repair, wiring {{on the outside of}} the vehicle to try to recover CMG 2 (Control Moment Gyro), and preparation for the external stowage platform. John Shannon, Manager of the Space Shuttle Operations and Integration reports from Engineering standpoint that the composites of the underside of the tile surface seen from pictures taken during the pitch maneuver were extremely clean; the Engineering staff continues to look at the focus inspection data from the orbital boom sensor system (OBSS) and other data to assess the condition of the vehicle. Solid rocket boosters were retrieved and are towed back to the Air Force hangar in Cape Carneval.

5000|$|At a {{later date}} a wall {{was added to the}} larger room to form the present central corridor. This wall was {{constructed}} of 100 millimetre wide v-jointed boards. The door and door hardware to this wall confirm its later construction. The v-jointed boards lining the ceiling to these rooms, the timber ceiling ventilators and the scotia cornices were probably added at this time as well. The ceilings may have been calico originally. The weatherboard walls to the eastern and western elevation may be original but if so were likely to have been unlined internally. The internal lining of 100 millimetre T and G boards are certainly a later addition. It is more probable that these walls were lined internally with studs exposed to the outside and that these have decayed and been replaced at {{a later date}}. This assertion is supported by <b>inspection</b> of the <b>door</b> and window sashes. The French doors {{at the front of the}} house have [...] "lambs tongue" [...] or ogee profile glazing bars which were hand moulded and which are more in keeping with earlier construction techniques. The windows have glazing bars which are machine moulded indicating that the sashes, if not the whole body of the windows, are later and likely to have been inserted when the east and west walls were reconstructed. Window hoods throughout are likely to date to this period also.|$|R
40|$|The {{interest}} in Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) has stimulated continuous research activities, {{in view of}} their potential in civilian and military applications. An autonomous MAV with dedicated onboard sensors {{would be capable of}} executing mission in closed environments, such as surveillance, in <b>door</b> <b>inspection</b> in support of rescue operations and information gathering. Flapping wing MAV (also referred to as ’ornithopter’), which is the most intriguing type in the MAV family is often inspired from biological examples has triggered attention due to their outstanding manoeuvrability and flight capability at the low Reynolds number regime. Like natural flyers, flapping wing MAVs are usually equipped with a single or multiple pairs of flexible wings to generate both thrust and lift at the same time. Compared to the other locomotion, the flappingmotion benefits from a number of specific unsteady lift enhancement mechanisms. This thesis performs an integrated experimental and numerical study in order to explore the aerodynamic behaviour associated with flapping wing MAVs. The study is hereby divided into twofold: (1) Experimentally investigate the aerodynamic characteristics of flappingwingMAV, using state-of-the-artmeasurement techniques; (2) Develop a novel numerical methodology with particular focus in simulating flapping wing aerodynamics. For the experimental study, theDelFlyMicro was employed as the testbed in this thesis. The DelFly Micro uses an X-wing configuration which performs the clap-and-fling mechanisms three times during each flapping period and thus will result in complex flow behaviour. The aerodynamic characteristics were evaluated by means of extensive force production and power consumption measurements. The aero-structural effect of the DelFly Micro is fist investigated by means of a vacuum test, where the aerodynamically associated thrust component and different deformation patterns in air and in vacuum were addressed. Subsequently, the effect of wing properties, including flapping frequency, flexibility and wing aspect ratio are also examined in terms of thrust production, power consumption and propulsive efficiency. To better understand the aerodynamic force generation with respect to the flow structures, flow topology was visualized by Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) techniques for the DelFlyMicro in both hover and forward flight configurations. The PIV measurement {{in the vicinity of the}} DelFly Micro revealed the formation, evolution of the vortical structures on the wing surface during flapping motion. A jet flow behaviour was revealed at all-time instants is induced by the clap and fling event. Three-dimensional flow structures in the wake of DelFly Micro were visualized by two reconstruction strategies: (1) a spatial reconstruction using Kriging regression with local error (can be regarded as the measurement uncertainties) estimates; (2) a temporal-spatial reconstruction based on the Taylor’s hypothesis of frozen flow. Two dominate structures generated during the instroke and outstroke alternatively shed from the wings which are quite isolated from each other for both hovering and forward flight configurations. In view of the facts that numerical simulating for flapping wing application is difficult due to the inherently large displacement during the flight. Particularly for the clap and fling event which is the most extreme situation would challenge the conventional dynamic mesh deformation techniques. A deformable mesh strategy was developed in this thesis with a specific purpose to simulate the flow with multiple bodies undergoing arbitrary large motion. The dynamic mesh strategy uses a hierarchical overset grid where the mesh quality and resolution can be independently controlled. Additionally, the deformation of the body is achieved by means of a RBF-based mapping mesh deformation technique which is proved to be efficient and robust in terms of CPU time and grid quality. The developed dynamic mesh method was embedded in an in-house programmed URANS solver and further used to simulate the DelFly II flapping wing MAV. The vortical structures demonstrate very complex flow behaviours associated with the DelFly II flappingwingMAV. Comparison between the numerical and the experimental results indicates that the numerical solver can provide a quantitative prediction of the unsteady aerodynamics of the flapping-wing MAV in terms of aerodynamic force production and flow structures.

40|$|Barbed wire encircles {{the shiny}} buildings. Some ten {{families}} sit on rows of plastic {{chairs on the}} brand new concrete veranda, waiting. The officer, holstering a revolver, walks past the young kids, who hardly pay him any attention, and {{stops in front of}} some men and women. He hands them little strips of paper to rub against the inside of their forearm for traces of drugs. The next day, drug detection dogs on the leash sniff us. The routine of weekend visits at the Townsville correctional centre has us queue to show our application permit and ID. Some girls change their tops and shoes as the Board does not permit entry with open shoes and sleeveless shirts. All bags, watches, jewelry, food and drinks have to be left in a locker. No money allowed either; if a visitor wishes to give some to a prisoner; he needs to hand it over to the officer who writes out a receipt. Another officer operates the computer which scans fingerprints and takes digital photos for identification at the electronic entrance gate to the jail. But the machine detector did not recognize my face and finger, nor did it recognize a young Aboriginal mother carrying a baby, and a Papua New Guinean woman with her teenage daughter. Two older men were also blocked inside the electronic double door. The guards took it calmly: “it happens all the time” they said. So we just signed in and passed through the door. Then some ten of us squeeze inside a cubicle for another <b>inspection</b> before the <b>door</b> opens into a big white room with a glass door facing a small yard enclosed by a high grey wall. Each of us had been given a number to match the one on the low metal tables, and once we are all seated on the metal chairs, a little door with a glass window opens and some twenty men, mostly young and Black walk in. Lex, wearing the prison uniform, brown T-shirt and trousers, comes to my table smiling. He looks handsome and serene, yet the serious and pensive expression on his face makes many people avert their gaze. It has been two years since he took me, his wife Cecilia and kids for a drive up to the spring of Palm Island. “Good memories, I like the way you describe that in the book…Happy time”, he said. He had brought the manuscript of the translation of our book, which the lawyer had sent him, for us to check together. He went to the machine {{in the corner of the}} hall to fetch tea and coffee. An officer brought a pen and paper I had been given permission to use during my special “professional visit”, organized by Levitt & Solicitors. I started to take notes of the comments Lex had penciled in the manuscript. We went through half the book in two hours. It was great to see the same concentration, precision, humor and impressive memory Lex had demonstrated when we worked on the book previously. The following day we finished checking the remainder of the book and started talking about the future. Lex was to be released on the 18 th of July 2010, and he planned to tour Australia and possibly overseas to talk about his vision for his people. Lex is a religious man with a spirituality he has forged for himself. As a young man, he read the Bible and had a revelation; he then adopted the Baha’i’ faith of his mother. After he had served a prison term for drunkenness, he asked his mother to leave him alone in his bedroom, so he could stop drinking. He never drank since. This is unusual for an Aboriginal man in jail, where most inmates are detained for assault under the influence. The Baha’i’ authorities had asked him to formally renounce his faith following an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on his speech at the 50 th anniversary celebration of the 1957 strike on Palm Island. According to the teaching of Bahaullah, followers cannot engage in politics and make political statements. Lex thought this was fair as he needed to take care of mundane things before he could share his faith with others. In the meantime he was reading Gandhi and asked for books on the Dalai Lama. I wondered why the Baha’i had not demanded his abnegation previously, when he was charged for being the ring leader of the riot in November 26, 2004, which was sparked by the findings of the autopsy of Cameron Doomadgee, alias Mulrunji, who died in custody. During the inquest into the suspicious death and the committal hearing of the rioters, the media gradually changed their representation of Palm Island, from depicting it as a dangerous place to expressing compassion for the shocking inequalities, the traumatic history and the dysfunctional bureaucratic system which suffocates Palm and other Aboriginal communities. The reports conveyed a feeling of responsibility. But when the policeman accused of Mulrunji’s death was acquitted in June 2007, all seemed to be forgotten. Lex tends to intimidate people. The media construed him as a potential terrorist, stereotyping him and the other Palm Islanders “as an uncontrollable and irrational group” by deliberately neglecting the cause for their uprising. 1 The unbalanced adverse publicity of the events contrasted the immoral offenders with the righteous sacrificial police and created what Thalia Anthony describes as “Moral Panic”: “The mainstream media, along with the Queensland Government and police union, produced a moral panic over the Palm Island protest that overshadowed the death in custody”. She argues that “the court that sentenced Wotton appropriated the moral panic over the offence to remove the death in custody as a sentencing factor”. Indeed the judge decided that the background for the riot, the death in police custody and subsequent findings of the autopsy, was irrelevant to the trial of Lex, charged with leading the uprising. But he admitted in his conclusion, available online that: “In my view the only thing in your favour in this involvement in this was that at stages you made some efforts to lessen the chances of the police officers being injured. The most significant of that is that on two occasions you took the crowd away from besieging the police. This allowed the police to leave the police station to go to the barracks and later from the barracks to go to the hospital. Particularly in relation to that second episode, it is clear from the video that the crowd was not surrounding those police officers when the decision was made to move. I am of the view that you personally moved the crowd away on each of those occasions. ” The judge further pointed out that although the police feared for their lives; no one had been physically injured and questioned the rioters’ intention to harm the police. The judge argued that the monetary damage caused by the destruction of the barracks was a compounding factor in the seriousness of Lex’s offence; this is questionable given that four years earlier it had been decided to demolish these barracks and replace them with a new police station. The speed of the fire, due to the lack of water, belied the fact that the rioters comprised only around 30 men, 60 women and 90 kids, as one officer testified during the committal hearing. The judge initially stated there were 300 rioters, but after viewing the video shot during the riot he believed most of them were mere spectators. Why then were the few hours of Palm unrest considered such danger compared to the Macquarie Fields disturbances which lasted four days with burning and fights? 2 The trial of Lex was emblematic of the issue that no one should attack state property because of the power it represents, which is precisely the reason rioters in Australia or anywhere else in the world choose to put fire to it. The act is one of empowerment through destruction of the very symbol that embodies disempowerment in a dysfunctional justice system that does not protect all citizens. Riots are a response to provocation which sometimes is the last straw. This was the case in the French suburbs riots in 2005, which were sparked by the death of two young kids electrocuted while running away from a police control, because they feared arrest for not having IDs on them. Could Lex’s trial have had a different outcome, similar to the famous American film 12 men in Anger, if only one person of the jury had argued a strong case to change everyone’s opinion? Or had the jury made up its mind before the trial even started? Lex saw one of the jury members asleep; others seemed not to listen to the defence pleading. Meanwhile lobby groups were protesting in support of Lex. YouTube broadcasted a protest by a group of people in support of Lex during his trial, amongst them a Bolivian woman who says that Indians were simultaneously protesting on the issue in front of the Australian Embassy in Bolivia. Internet networks of solidarity connect different victims of social injustice across the planet. The fact that the voice of minorities can be heard, even that of your neighbourhood when it experiences social and physical hardships should be seen as a hope for us all. But the agenda of Lex’s trial was political. Even though it coincided with Barack Obama’s election to the presidency and the media hailing a new era of no racial discrimination, the police officers on duty during the Palm riot were ceremoniously given bravery awards shortly before Lex’s sentencing. Palm Islanders’ reaction to this new provocation was unexpected, instead of social unrest they spoke to the media. Real life is beyond symbols. Over the past three years there have been new deaths in custody, resulting in riots and social group actions. Without the riot in November 2004 there would have probably been no media interest in Cameron Doomadgee’s death in police custody. The sentencing judge chose to ignore the background of the riot, and instead argued the importance of deterrence to prevent lawlessness and anarchy. He thereby exculpated the action of the police and perhaps inadvertently condoned the inequity suffered by Aboriginal people. The tension between police and Aboriginal citizens is growing in spite of Kevin Rudd’s historic apology to Australia’s Stolen Generation on February 13, 2008. 3 Despite declaring his resolve that “the injustices of the past must never ever happen again”, and promising “a future where all Australians, whatever their origins, are truly equal partners, with equal opportunities and with an equal stake in shaping the next chapter in the history of this great country, Australia”, the emergency intervention in the Northern Territory in June 2007 implemented by the suspension of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 has yet to be reversed. The communities exempted of the Racial Discrimination Act, 73 in total, saw their land confiscated for five years, and self-management and welfare programs suspended by the Federal Government. In March 2009, following a complaint lodged by a collective of Aboriginal communities, the UN wrote a letter to Kevin Rudd expressing its concern over the suspension of the Racial Discrimination Act. In April 2009 Kevin Rudd signed the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People. In August 2009 the special Rapporteur of the UN to Australia stressed the need to reinstate the protection of the Racial Discrimination Act. 4 Many nations have what Appadurai calls the “Fear of small numbers”, of minorities who like Indigenous people in Australia demand to speak and act for themselves. Around the world Indigenous experience has led to a different perception of sovereignty; minorities can adopt sovereignty across borders, as they share the struggle against injustice. They look for a model of governance which is not restrained by the State. Edouard Glissant and Patrick Chamoiseau, both famous French Caribbean authors have published a magnificent little book “L’intraitable beauté du monde. Adresse à Obama” (The intractable beauty of the world, a letter to Obama), in which they write that “people today have the premonition that the power of nations does no longer make them great”. They invite us on an imaginative ride of creating a new world beyond the discriminations produced by many States. The following chapters try to put the Palm Island riot into perspective in order to understand the Aboriginal visions of contemporary Australia as well as the global world we live in where social justice means what Lex said in 2005 : “I don’t want to be treated as an Aboriginal person, I want to be treated as a human being; we don’t want two laws, one White, one Black, we want one law for all, we want to live in peace”...|$|R
