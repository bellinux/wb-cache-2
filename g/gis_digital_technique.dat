40|$|Abstract: Landfill {{selection}} {{in an urban}} area is a critical issue in the urban planning process because of its enormous impact on the economy, ecology and the environmental health of the region. With the growth of urbanization {{as well as the}} desire to live in cities, lager amount of wastes are produced and unfortunately the problem gets bigger everyday. With the development of Geographic Information System (GIS), the landfill sitting process is increasingly based on more difficult spatial analysis and modeling. In this paper, GIS and fuzzy multi criteria decision analysis (FMCDA) are integrated to solve the landfill site selection problem and to develop a ranking of the potential landfill areas based on a variety of criteria. Two stages of analyses are considered to form a spatial decision support system (SDSS) for waste management in urban region, Bandar Abbas. In the first stage, in order to find the suitable sites, <b>GIS</b> <b>digital</b> map overlay <b>techniques</b> are used. A proper waste disposal area is a function of many parameters including distance to urban and rural areas, distance to industrial and agricultural areas, distance to permanent and seasonal rivers, distance to faults, terrain slope, underground water level, transportation network, soil type, geology and both present and future land use of the area. The second-stage analysis uses fuzzy multi criteria decision-making (FMCDM) to rank different landfill sites for Bandar Abbas based on decisions given by a group of experts.

40|$|ABSTRACT: With {{the recent}} rapid {{development}} of the Internet and portable multimedia terminals, the concept of GIS has been introduced to many aspects of our daily life. Although the <b>digital</b> map and <b>GIS</b> service systems abruptly increased on the Internet, the vast amount of geographical information data and the limited speed of the service cause problems when the GIS data for the actual users are transmitted through the Internet and saved in the portable terminals in a short time. In this study, the most efficient technique to transmit the large-volume <b>GIS</b> <b>digital</b> map images is identified to address such problems. First, the file-based digital map v 2. 0 and shape files, the XML-based 3 DF-GML, GML, CityGML and KML, and the database-based geodatabase files are used to form layers in the 3 D GIS engine, and the data are transmitted to the simulator. Second, there is the streaming <b>technique</b> for the <b>digital</b> map screen images. In this method, the administrator and users connect to the server, and the 3 D GIS engine and diverse <b>GIS</b> <b>digital</b> map information on the administrator screen are transmitted to the users in the forms of screen captures or streaming service. In this study, {{the characteristics of the}} two methods are examined, and the more efficient way to deliver the <b>GIS</b> <b>digital</b> map information is determined. The detailed features of the chosen large-volume <b>GIS</b> <b>digital</b> map transmission method are designed, and the items that should be considered are identified...|$|R

40|$|Proceedings of the 1999 Georgia Water Resources Conference, March 30 and 31, Athens, Georgia. In {{an effort}} to provide {{citizens}} in the Georgia region with information about watershed management and water quality, the Georgia Environmental Organization (GEO), the University of Georgia, and Southern Geographic Information Services, a corporate business unit of the Southern Company, have developed a geographic information system (GIS) database for a Georgia Watershed Atlas. The Atlas includes 14 major watersheds divided into 179 Ecobasins. In addition to base category data of boundaries, roads, lakes, and rivers, the Atlas database includes wetlands, federal and state superfund sites (CERCLA and HSRA), waste water discharge sites (NPDES), gauging stations, surface mines, solid waste sites, hazardous waste sites, national and state parks, airports, cities, urban and industrial intake and discharge sites, and water quality sampling sites. The database {{is being used to}} produce an Atlas/Directory with each Ecobasin represented on a 17 x 22 -inch map and a corresponding information page. The database and Atlas production have been accomplished with <b>GIS</b> and <b>digital</b> mapping <b>techniques</b> described in this paper. The information pages are briefly described and the items included are listed. Sponsored and Organized by: U. S.

The paper analyzes pathological conditions and diseases of the kidney in a series of 3100 intravenous urographies (IVU) performed at the Radiology Center, Clinical Center Niš, during the period 2009 - 2012. Radiographic examination was performed on X-ray device with a TV chain Schimadzu. IVU was performed according to the standard protocol. Contrast media: Ultravist 370 ®. X-ray images were digitally processed in Agfa CR- 30 digital processor. The results are shown illustratively, by urographic images - anomalies, calculosis, hydronephrosis, tumors and other pathological conditions and diseases of the urinary system. This paper presents numerous and various pathological conditions and diseases of the urinary system. Among the valuable radiological examination methods IVU has maintained a leading position. The usage of <b>digital</b> <b>techniques</b> made IVU faster, easy and efficient method of examination, while the obtained urograms are of satisfactory quality and adequate contrast visualization of the urinary system...|$|R
